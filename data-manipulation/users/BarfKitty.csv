schoolpsychology,ffi5xev,t3_etgzbu,1579965946.0,"I'm at a high school. It's much more assessment and much less behavior. I identify serious mental illness in GE students and do referrals to a local agency so they can be appropriately treated (e.g. Probable schizophrenia or schizoaffective-- I've had 5 students in a school of 2200 show up with psychotic symptoms that I didn't think were drug related!) and actually do a lot fewer risk assessments than the Jr High and Elementary psychs in my district. I run the MTSS team designing tier 1 interventions based on survey data. At the end of the day, I'm an assessment machine which I enjoy."

Later I wipe my face, other arm, upper lip got stabbed a bunch. Turns out I brushed up against one with that arm too. They are the devil."
succulents,fep57ph,t1_fen06u9,1579312397.0,I was making jokes. I risk plant damage but I use tongs. I make enough use of my  tweezers specifically for garage use already...

Ever handled an eves needle? I'm legit scared of that plant and somehow ended up with about 10 of those landmines in my garden."

homeowners,fegm3qo,t3_eozcd0,1579096935.0,"My dad has mowed our lawn when we've been at work several times when he's known we're absurdly busy (both in grad school working full time). Con? Everyone once in a while they drive by with a friend to show the house off to one of their friends. Hardly a con, I don't hear about it until after, it's not intrusive."
schoolpsychology,feft8ow,t3_eoq81m,1579064496.0,I made the leap at 32. Felt ancient. My peers got to move back in with family to live while they did unpaid fieldwork hours. I already had money saved so I could pay my mortgage at that time. Just be prepared financially for the hit of unpaid field work hours and possibly an unpaid internship. My internship is fully paid but thats rare.

YouShouldKnow,fda8gxr,t1_fda4kqj,1578242972.0,"That's a myth. Even Harley Davidson is asking people not to make aftermarket changes to the bikes. They stopped making the parts to do the swap to make it louder. Bikes are already 85 decibels, which is loud enough to damage hearing with prolonged exposure. Decibels are logarithmic, so bikes ""upgraded"" to 105 decibels will damage hearing much quicker. A neighbor's friend comes over everyweekend and they sit in the driveway turning the bike on, yelling to each other over the sound of the bike (if I'm outside gardening it hurts me, probably 40 ft away). Then the worst of it he revs the engine and it'll make a pop sound that really hurts my ears. It hurts my ears even when in my living room! I feel really helpless to the situation."
succulents,fd3iy71,t3_ejxq5b,1578158769.0,"The bottom half is rotted. The top is etoliated. Cut the top paddle. Make sure there is no rot on it. Set it out to dry for a couple days. Repot it and wait a whole before watering. Slowly move it to full sun. That plastic pot makes overwatering even easier so considering going terracotta.

God speed, you poor tortured cactus."

tifu,fcxj08n,t1_fcw5f6j,1578064126.0,Penis size and placement matter. Some penises are set higher on the body and some lower on the body. One that is higher is easier to tuck into a waist band. An average to above average hard dick will not be held back by under wear.

funny,fck6g0s,t1_fcjwwfw,1577717916.0,"I've always known this the other way. Apple users are poor now, their phones are far more expensive (than Android phones in general, Samsung is sorta on par I think) and Android accessories are cheap. The joke has been Apple users are dumb so they need it simple and android users have more flexibility using a system that requires you to be ""smart"".

*edit. I guess I'm dumb. I realize the parent poster and I have different perspectives on poor. I meant ""poor now"" because it's so expensive. Parent poster mean poor as in ""couldn't ever afford the thing""."

answers,fck3ipt,t1_fcjoggi,1577715508.0,"I left it off because it was irrelevant. There are natural and unnatural carcinogens. The concept of natural and unnatural is pretty dumb but that's a concept for another day.

 Most important to my argument which arose because a user argued all burning things were equally bad, there are things that when burned ARE NOT carcinogens. For example, wood burned is not a carginogen (thats why having a fireplace in your home won't give you cancery) but if you throw wood in there that's been treated (like railroad ties) now you have a carcinogen."
answers,fcguo7e,t1_fcgtbof,1577644165.0,"Not really making that comparison except to say that firefighters don't generally die 10 yrs after they start working... Which would be the implication of saying the stuff that burned at WTC is the same as anything else burning. 

If carcinogens were anything that was burned that would be the definition. Instead wikipedia says...  ""Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke."" It wouldn't need examples if it were anything that produced a smoke when burned (paper, wood, etc)"
answers,fcgqbwb,t1_fcgoxla,1577642945.0,"Here are some things added to cigarettes which are carginogens: Hydrogen cyanide, Formaldehyde, 
Arsenic, Ammonia, uranium, Benzene... (source: https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/tobacco-and-cancer/carcinogens-found-in-tobacco-products.html). 

Remember how the majority of 9/11 first responders died with 10 years? It was because of the deadly carginogens that were used in building the world trade center. 

I don't usually spend this much time responding to a post but your understanding of what causes cancer really concerns me."

answers,fcgolum,t1_fcgo3ip,1577642381.0,Inhaling smoke is bad. Inhaling smoke from toxic things burning is way worse (think all things carcinogens)
SupermodelCats,fcgdqpn,t1_fcg42qe,1577638909.0,"Shedding has very little to do with allergies. It's the dander from their saliva. Certain breeds like siamese have less dander. Then there are those cats you can buy for like $1,500 that are super low dander. If I remember right there is one breeder in New York that will ship you the cat (already spayed/neutered of course)."
plantclinic,fc5i5fj,t1_fc4jrya,1577458253.0,If it's squishy cut it off. The pads can each be replanted separately. If it's squishy the rot will spread if you leave it on.
