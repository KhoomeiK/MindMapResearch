Frugal,fgsv4hr,t1_fgsum0a,1581093292.0,"It’s true that frugality doesn’t necessarily mean buying cheap: when frugality is practised intentionally with a focus on the environment, then it is for sure one of the best “lifestyles” for environmental impact. 

But many frugal people are only concerned with minimising their economic spending at the expense of the environment. So whatever is cheapest is what they will buy, no matter how bad that is for the environment. For example people who call themselves frugal and grab a wad of disposable napkins and single use ketchup packets from a fast food place to take home are not being environmentally friendly, they’re just trying to save themselves money."

We are highly likely in the midst of a 6th Mass Extinction and are definitely experiencing a biodiversity crisis, and we have nations like Japan greedily eyeing up whales for consumer markets. Humans suck ... most of the time."
climate,fgss040,t3_f0ayq0,1581091416.0," These corporations really have no shame at all do they?

This is like BP asking people how they intend to lower their carbon footprint while relentlessly pumping oil out the damn ground and throttling global CO2 concentrations way above safe limits."
DeTrashed,fgsjp6m,t1_fgsgirq,1581086050.0,"Oh you should totally start using a hashtag on your posts / images  like #buttssuck #tobaccno or just revive the  #fillthebottle  hashtag and see if it lifts off! 

I bet by Summer it will when more people are out and about. :D"
