It's interesting, made me genuinely care about the characters, but it's also quite dramatic, and that can be a turn-off for some people. It does tackle some pretty serious issues like death, sexual assault, what ""being yourself"" means, depression, and trust, and does feature romance that's not for comedic purposes. The show's greatest strength is character interaction. Every character is very aware of every other character, and changes how they act slightly depending on who they're around.  
**(minor spoilers from here)**   
It ends semi-conclusively, in that there are no major conflicts or plot arcs left hanging, but you also never do find out the root cause of everything that happened, leaving me just a bit unsatisfied.   


Overall, I'd recommend it. Watch the first episode or two, and you'll have a solid idea of what the show is."

I've been told rap was an acronym for so long that I was really confused by you, and went to go get citations. Apparently I was wrong, so thank you, random person, for teaching me something.
