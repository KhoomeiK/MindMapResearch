bestoflegaladvice,fem0wuq,t1_fekvtta,1579236191.0,"I learned that it depends on the laws in the state. For example, many years ago my parents (Georgia) wanted to disinherit my brother. But, their attorney advised them to leave him$10, as that would demonstrate that they considered him and chose to leave him essentially nothing. Fast forward 40 years, I'm now executor for a friend's estate (Florida), and he chose to leave his elderly disabled mom (who he still had somewhat of a relationship with)  nothing. That stung my ass, so I asked the attorney if she could contest the will on grounds of no consideration, because she wasn't even mentioned.  Turns out Florida doesn't have such a legal situation, and she had very little chance of prevailing."

AskReddit,fe26aui,t1_fe1rrhu,1578834956.0,"Well, not much actual parts, mostly a lot of  blood and brain matter. We burned the couch she was sitting on. And this happened in 1985, if there were crime scene clean up companies no one told us about them. The funeral home didn't offer assistance.
     I just lost another friend to suicide this past May. I cleaned up that one too but it was less than a cup of blood  on a garage floor.   Didn't see the need to spend $ for that small a spill.   I'm the executor of his estate and it's all going to charity so I'm trying to preserve his funds."
