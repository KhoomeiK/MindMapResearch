ghostbusters,fcl0f55,t3_ehqn37,1577737102.0,Mine is sitting until I have time to devote to it to make it as good as I want it.
cats,fckjy9e,t3_eho3ij,1577726972.0,So very sorry. It's hard to lose a family member.

ghostbusters,fckfjp7,t1_fck2wkd,1577724197.0,"It should be, they released a couple of Brickheadz of Venkman and Slimer. I am looking forward to new sets.

Frankly, I am hoping that LEGO decides to do a UCS Ecto1 like they did with the 1989 Batmobile recently."
cats,fck2921,t3_ehlrtn,1577714392.0,Sorry for you loss.
legostarwars,fck1lk6,t1_fcj2gvh,1577713796.0,"Nice collection you got! Great start. LEGO is a great stress relief, something about having it all right there, from beginning to finished model without having to glue or paint. I use it for that all the time.

I may also recommend using stud.io found on bricklink to build sets you can't get or lay out MOCs."
legodeal,fc7aed1,t1_fc6afac,1577501783.0,Is that an app or website?
