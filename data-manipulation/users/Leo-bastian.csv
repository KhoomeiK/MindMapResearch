 Also, AE2s Interfaces have a smarter way of interacting with non-crafting recipes like the fluid transposer, where you can programm different recipes in a row, instead of just stacking them. For an example,you use a setup for an fluid transposer. You put the interface on a chest,and then put a pipe with 2 retrievers/ filters/ whatever you are using on the fluid transposer and magma crucible. You make a whitelist for redstone,cryotheum,ender pearls etc. Onto the crucible filter,and a blacklist onto the transposer. If you need to craft parts of the ingredients first,for an example cryotheum dust needed some more niter,which was needs time to make in the pulverizer,what can  happen with rs is that it first melts cryotheum in the crucible,and then instantly melts redstone for another part of the recipe,which was already in the chest,after there is no more cryotheum in the chest. Then a niter finishes and rs puts more of the cryotheum and transposer part in the chest,which leads to a filling of the transposer with the transposer parts because they are still in there cause they havent finished. Then the cryotheum goes out, the rest still is in the chest but now redstone blocks the system and it collapses. AE2 would wait for putting in the redstone until the other recipe is finished,which leads to no collapse of the system. 

TLDR: AE2 waits for recipes to not stack on each other until they are finished,while not blocking machines while they arent working cause something still produces parts of the machine input. 

PS: very specific, but thats a problem I encountered with RS thats doesnt happen with AE2. And the way the problem works makes me believe other automated machines will have same problems"
