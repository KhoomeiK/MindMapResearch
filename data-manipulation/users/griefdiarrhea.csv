unclebens,feiohdd,t1_feh7ff5,1579143313.0,"I think another aspect is you have to pick it up and look at the bottom to check progress, and people get excited/impatient. Add in the fact that it's really easy not to tape up a cut corner adequately and you've got contamination. I have never had contamination until I tried UB, but also the only ones that contaminated were the ones I wouldn't stop fucking with."

tippytaps,fdakjb2,t1_fd9xrne,1578247062.0,Quick anecdote: a family I used to dog sit for a family who had to sunscreen their chocolate lab's balls because they were hairless and kept getting wicked bad sun burns. They decided to neuter him after an embarrassing summer slathering his sack in SPF.
