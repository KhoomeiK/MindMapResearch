Old cats just know what's up. Now that he's finally coming off of all of his medicine (he was on a pretty heavy painkiller for a month) I keep learning new quirks about his personality. I love it.

Please give all 3 chin scratches from Goose and I!"
Catswhoyell,ff7x7xj,t1_fev2f0h,1579660508.0,You all are beautiful! Enjoy your sweet oldies.
Catswhoyell,ff7x1ex,t1_ff4ng4x,1579660382.0,Thank you! I'm super grateful to have lucked out with such a great older kitty.
Catswhoyell,ff7wz3b,t1_ff5z1s5,1579660339.0,Yeahhh I realized that's incorrect. I wish they could grow back! His incision where his little lower canine tooth was removed got infected.

But really, thank you and 19! Wowza. I sure hope Goose makes it to that age."
Catswhoyell,fepeegl,t3_eqazak,1579318442.0,Spread the word! Adopt a senior cat. Goose and I highly recommend it.
Catswhoyell,fepe3j3,t1_fepdgl2,1579318236.0,"Highly recommend it! I knew I wanted a senior cat when I went to the shelter last week and knew I'd be walking into old cat health issues... BUT despite his last family returning him after 6 months, having to Uber to 3 emergency vet visits this week, a tooth infection, and a kitty enema with 8 ounces of poop, there's nothing like falling asleep cuddled up with this old boy. I want nothing more than to get him back to good health and spoil him for the rest of our time together. He deserves it SO much- they all do."
Catswhoyell,fepcpux,t1_fepcl0z,1579317299.0,"He's the BEST senior kitty. He goes from yelling at me for food, to laying on my chest and gently caressing my face with his paw. Best of both worlds!"
cats,fe67zgz,t1_fe1mbrn,1578883799.0,"I'm so sorry about your cat- that is so so sad. 

The last family did have kids and another cat. Just the two of us chillin against the world."
cats,fe13tho,t1_fe127mv,1578822221.0,Thank you! I'M really lucky to have him... he truly is the best and currently sleeping cuddled up next to me. I get to go to bed every night thinking how lucky I am to have found this cuddle bug.
