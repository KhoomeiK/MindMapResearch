I'm sure he knows all the fans realize that we clearly overachieved this year which is a great sign and complete responsibility goes to Mayock and Gruden, they drafted and signed guys that love to play football which is something we really need. I haven't felt this much excitement for the team since 2017. We've all suffered watching this team for so long, but the future is looking bright as fuck. We don't know if next years draft will be as great as this one... He hit on so many picks that it's possible it wont be, but it will be good. Mayock has a great eye for talent, I honestly feel that the year after next, we will start becoming a top name in the NFL.

Now, on to Carr... I have been one of many to go back and forth on Carr, but the primary reason we need to keep him around is plain and simple. If Carr has done anything well in his career, its orchestrate and complete 4th quarter comebacks. He has proven that when the game is on the line he gets the job done. This is something you need in a QB when the playoffs come around. I feel like we need to see him start in the playoffs for a couple seasons before we can honestly say that he needs to be replaced.
