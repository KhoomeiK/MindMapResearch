todayilearned,ffq8vaz,t1_ffq46r5,1580126331.0,"> a lot of that politeness is superficial

Politeness is certainly not the same thing as niceness. 

I've traveled quite a bit in the U.S. and the relative differences in politeness have confused and amazed me.

In general, people in the American South are much more polite than those in the North. That is certainly not to say that Southerners are better people than those in the North (I suspect that the ratio of good people to bad people is roughly the same everywhere). Southerners will often be polite to your face, even if they are the type to stab you in the back. With most Northerners, you know where you stand.

In some cases, Northerners will even *sound* rude when they are being nice. Years ago, my mother and I were on a bus in New York City. We were struggling with a map and bus schedules, when a man  *yelled* at us ""**Hey! Where you tryin' to go?**"". When we told him, he said ""**Get *off* this bus! You are on the *wrong* bus! You wanna be on bus number fifty-three. You got it? Fifty-three!**"".  He'd gone out of his way to help us, but to our ears, he sounded angry and rude."

I don't blame myself, but I have thought about what I could have done. It may have been better if I had taken the time to follow through and make sure he *got* help.  I could have asked what his other sources of support were. I could have gone over to his home immediately and insisted that he let me take him to see a professional."

Yes! I'd even say that I recognize people I know, less from their facial features than from other visual clues. Somewhat often, I'll see someone who reminds me of someone I know, yet the facial resemblance is small. It isn't unusual for me to see a person on TV or a YouTube video and ask my wife ""This person reminds me of our older daughter. What is it that makes me see that? Are their eyes alike? Is it the shape of their mouths?"".

My wife usually has to watch it for a bit before she can see what I'm seeing and then it is almost always a mannerism of some sort. My wife's reply will be something like ""They both look upwards and touch their chin when listening and thinking""."

I've traveled quite a bit in the US. Even today, I've *seen* more overt racism in the North than in the South. I don't think any conclusions about the percentages of racists can be drawn from that.

I've got to disagree there. I already save some old, interesting things knowing that they will become more rare as time goes on. I'm the only grandchild and have things like WWII ration books and streetcar tokens that belonged to my grandparents. Those things were literary worthless when my grandparents first saved them.

  Now, I could sell them. I don't, because I think that my granddaughter will continue to find them interesting when she is grown up. If not, *she* can sell them.

I don't own any racist stuff, but I absolutely would acquire such things if I ran across them at a bargain price. I'm pretty sure that my granddaughter would find it interesting. If not, *she* can donate it.

I am sure I'd feel differently had whatever racist item belonged to my family member. That might be really awkward for my granddaughter, as she is considered ""biracial""."
