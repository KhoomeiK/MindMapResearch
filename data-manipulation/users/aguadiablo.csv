TheBluePill,ffma3rv,t1_fflo7n5,1580051248.0,"I think a lot of these ideas comes from media and social media. Most of these men don't have any real interactions with women.

So what does media show? Media shows often shows two types of men, in a very simplistic and generalist sense. You've got your Brad Pitts, Tom Cruises, Ryan Reynoldses, Ryan Goslings etc etc. The heart throbs, or in the case of their terminology the Chads.

 These are the men that are often shown as desirable and are the leading men in rom coms and more. These are the men that are a lot of women in real life also find attractive. So they see these actors in steamy scenes and that's what they want. But they know they don't look like these men.

They see themselves as more like Seth Rogan, Kevin James, Michael Cera and Kevin Smith. Men who they probably would call betas. Now even though they may star alongside beautiful women, they often shown in relationships where they have complained about not having sex.

Now there's a lot of issues with the TV series and films that these second lot of actors appear in, but that's who they see themselves as. But these men are seen as the more average man.

Then there's the recent films that star Rebel Wilson and Amy Schumer in rom coms alongside the likes of Liam Hemsworth. Which these films are a reaction to the body acceptance movement.

But then the men, that this sub discusses, are becoming bitter. They are interpreting it all as all women should be desirable but only a small percentage of men are desirable.

Then there's Tinder which is interpreted as the dating scene summed into an app. That Tinder is the full complete picture. They see that most woman gets hundreds of likes, but they are not.

This resulted in a man trying to shame a woman after meeting with a woman he was talking to on tinder whilst pretending to be the Chad.

There's also been times when women have criticized Jason Momoa for looking fat and unflattering in some holiday pictures. Things like this reinforces theirs beliefs. And they use it pull younger insecure men into their belief systems.

The bottom line is that they are bitter because they believe that if they want to have the lives they want, they have to look like Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio. On the other hand, if you look like anything less, e.g. Kevin James or Michael Cera, they are going to be trapped in a loveless sexless marriage.

P.S. They will also probably believe that Seth Rogan and Kevin James are only married because of their money."
