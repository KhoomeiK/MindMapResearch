I don't know about that. Most people I know who voted for him are in terrible marriages. I think why so many people like him is they see themselves in him. They're stupid, they're much poorer than they let on, they care too much what people think of them, they're ugly, they're fat, no one truly enjoys their company, no one truly loves them, all of their business ideas have failed, they're spiteful, they're misogynistic, they're racist, and they only care about themselves.

I'm sure I could go on and on, but I'll stop there. I know dozens of people that still support him and each display at least 10 of those 12 traits listed, most of them fully embracing the list. These people don't value marriage, their values exactly mirror his own."

In fact, no woman has ever asked how big my dick is, even the ones that have heard rumors. It just doesn't happen.

But then... what about people who are in their 20s and 30s and look young? They're just not allowed to have sex ever because it offends your sensibilities? Porn that otherwise has of-age actors but is meant to depict younger folk is considered child porn. So you can have someone that looks 30 but is 13. Illegal. Or someone that looks 13 but is 30.

Your dog is sentient, your gun is not. If your gun can, of it's own accord, go around shooting people, I'd say you have a really big problem. You can control your gun at all times, you can't control your dog. Equating a gun to a dog is an even deeper problem (although if your dog has shown a penchant for biting kids, yeah, you'll probably be forced to put it down), but let's move on to the funny hole you dug yourself into.

Equating a gun to a car is hilarious, because cars are heavily regulated. I'd feel much better about you owning a firearm if you had to get a license to purchase one, said purchase had to be reported to the state, and in an instance of you operating it improperly (say, idk, while drunk? or letting a child operate it?) that license could be taken away from you and further use could send you to prison. Somehow I don't think you'd want similar regulations on guns though.

Similarly I could make the argument that if pro-life people are against abortions, why do they get abortions so much? I just don't personally know a ton of people that have had abortions and are against it, so the cheating example is a perfect argument for 99% or more of people having no moral code whatsoever. And if you don't have a moral code, I don't think you deserve to live.

I bet more people than you know in your friend circle have cheated. I'd be willing to bet nearly all of them. The difference between us is I know a *lot* of people, and people talk. If you have a tight friend group you'll never hear that they cheated on their SOs because you'd only know if the cheater directly told you. But if you started talking to more people, you'd find out quick. The vast majority of cheating I know of came from my knowledge of them having a bf/gf, and a mutual acquaintance's knowledge that they fucked someone else, or visa versa, and it coming out in a random discussion.

That's a great point, but I don't know that it makes *her* famous, which is what OP claimed. While perhaps being the most famous thing she's ever done, I doubt she herself is a household name for it (though I could be wrong). At any rate, thanks for giving perspective without being the asshole I usually expect on this site (your demeanor makes me think it wasn't you, but some other jackass that downvoted me for a legit discussion because they hate themselves)!
