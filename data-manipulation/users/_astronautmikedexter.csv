My600lbLife,ffhsnvy,t1_ffhh8mz,1579951864.0,I don't understand what you're trying to imply here. Totally out of nowhere.

fatpeoplestories,ffho2fn,t1_fffzq5n,1579944763.0,Why on you on this sub? I don't think this is the place for you.
insaneparents,fffyyh0,t1_fffoakd,1579894859.0,Bahahahaha. Good thing you linked that chart proving you wrong.
politics,ff3g2u6,t1_ff3dreo,1579540320.0,...ok. You took that to heart.
politics,ff3ai9p,t1_ff31xj4,1579537416.0,He drives me insane. He _never_ challenges his guests. Just lies back and accepts it.

politics,ferq065,t1_ferokir,1579357032.0,"I don't even have that many pictures of myself with other people. I need to step up my photo game, Parnas style."
politics,fer9l5d,t1_feptqxe,1579351430.0,"That's exactly why he's going public. If he makes himself high profile then it would be much more suspicious if he ""suicided"" himself at this point. Being in the public eye makes him a harder target. Not saying he is completely safe from being Epsteined, but it certainly gives him and his family a better chance at staying alive."
politics,fepbej6,t1_feoz4hu,1579316415.0,100% drunk. Coming from a recovering alcoholic. Can't fool a fellow alkie.

politics,fempdow,t1_femilek,1579265604.0,"Polls and ratings are all he understands, and all he thinks matters. Never mind the fact that even his precious polls aren't reflecting kindly. 


But, yes, that polls comment was completely out of the blue and had no bearing on the subject at hand. He just hates Acosta and had to say something he felt was going to put Acosta in his place."
politics,femp1x9,t1_fem3wiv,1579265289.0,"For someone who lies every other sentence, for over 70 years, he is a _terrible_ liar. My three year old is more sly than him."

My600lbLife,fdoccr8,t1_fdo55wk,1578602599.0,"I don't think it's very fair to judge a person on their addiction. Alcohol can make good people do terrible things. As a recovering alcoholic, I find your comment a little hurtful. My dad was an alcoholic, too, as with some other family members, so I know how hard it can be to grow up with that. But hate never solves anything."

fatlogic,fdnactd,t3_em9cfi,1578581437.0,I'm stuck on the fact this person almost passes out from walking up two flights of stairs. That's...not good.

UnresolvedMysteries,fdmcfha,t1_fdm6ltc,1578545487.0,"Aldrin has spoken about his alcoholism and depression. I could see how a person who struggles with those things could feel unfulfilled and/or like a failure, no matter how successful they are to the public. My money is on him."

fatlogic,fd95221,t3_ek9vqn,1578228553.0,This reads like erotica for FAs.

instantkarma,fcux40c,t1_fcupbml,1577990284.0,"Yeah, that's what's important. Not the fact that thousands are now homeless, and half a billion animals are dead."

UnresolvedMysteries,fcuj9ui,t1_fcuiio3,1577982266.0,Doesnt make me angry at all lmao. I just keep coming back for the entertainment.

UnresolvedMysteries,fcrv8hp,t1_fcrjjuz,1577907072.0,"Instead of doubling down on this, you should just do a little more reading, or watch a documentary about it. You are very argumentative, for really no reason. In no way was I rude to you, yet I get a smart ass response. Tone it down.



Edit: of course OP downvoted this. Just because you don't like an answer isn't cause for downvoting."

UnresolvedMysteries,fcrglsr,t3_eikw0u,1577901560.0,"There is really no mystery. I've seen docs on this. The man, Don Julian Santana, started collecting dolls after a young girl died (drowned?) and he found one in the water. It grew from there, and as the previous commenter said, mental illness is probably a factor."
trashy,fcq642h,t1_fcq4mxy,1577879564.0,"Ok then, no, it isn't funny to say derogatory statements toward a specific group of people, suggesting that that group is inferior."
EntitledBitch,fcq4cw9,t3_eigshw,1577878441.0,I think there's more to this. Why has CPS come to your house multiple times before the incident with your sister? There's some fucked up dynamics here. I feel bad for your sister more than anyone else in this situation.
