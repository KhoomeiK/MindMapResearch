Thanks for asking this."
GetMotivated,fcf2qyk,t1_fcf0b3i,1577626076.0,"I am now expressing gratitude to you - that sounds something right up my alley! I’ve tried everything - gratitude, mantras, repeating things, smiling even if I’m feeling awful... doesn’t work Lol 
Thanks for the link and info, this is definitely something I can relate to! Have a fabulous NY"
AmItheAsshole,fcf1ere,t1_fcai8ut,1577625696.0,"Just to say that what those kids destroyed are “WORK EQUIPMENT”! It’s not just a tablet, not just an iPad, it’s OP’s TOOL TO WORK! You might’ve been a bit rude in your comments but there wasn’t a F given about the incident from the parents of said kids. NTA and you should get the exact same WORK EQUIPMENT that the kids destroyed (while under supervision of parents or lack of) and the financial damage caused by not finishing the work. Nothing more, nothing less. 
I’m sorry OP, I work with the same and I can’t imagine losing a precious work tool like that - but I know most people see it as a “tablet” for entertainment hence why I keep it hidden from everyone not only kids, it infuriates me how people can be so oblivious when it comes to respecting other people’s objects/stuff."
GetMotivated,fcez0dn,t1_fceam8u,1577625042.0,"Thank you. I’ve read much about habits - which can basically change your life and thought patterns - so introducing those principles in here sounds logical. 
“Repeat” being the keyword and the hardest part to be honest because sometimes I’m on a good stride and pffffttttt I go down. Gotta learn to keep afloat. Thanks again :)"
GetMotivated,fceynvc,t1_fcehqp7,1577624934.0,I was also afraid of my comment being taken the wrong way but I’m so tired I need ELI5 on this
GetMotivated,fcdwg02,t3_egxsa4,1577614529.0,"Am I missing something? I have zero control over my thoughts and though I have real mental issues I don’t think anyone can really control what they’re thinking about... Similar to “Don’t think about an elephant” - “Don’t stress because of this particular problem” -.-‘ 
Any tips on how to have any control appreciated. Mindfulness meditation helps but it’s a daily and nightly struggle."
AskReddit,fc2ibtn,t1_fc2dvy7,1577361775.0,And those friends are your real family because you got to choose them. Once I realized it my life did a 180. I have *my* family and then I have *the* family.
