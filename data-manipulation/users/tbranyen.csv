sanfrancisco,ffcnoag,t1_ffckjve,1579803323.0,I thought they were different companies as they don't share a logo or year of establishment. Can you get the exact same items there that you used to get in the Mission?
sanfrancisco,ffc63sy,t1_ffbbjyb,1579792406.0,Don't fuck with peoples shit. What the hell.
sanfrancisco,ffc5tnq,t3_est8ht,1579792215.0,"I have a few boxes left myself, wasn't even sure if they were still good. Did they taste fine?"
vinyl,ffajcep,t1_ffahi7g,1579737158.0,"I'm not really sure what you mean. Sealed !== Mint in goldmine or anywhere else I've looked. A sealed record should be graded separately as sealed and media grading unknown. As far as the seller is concerned they cannot grade the media unless they open it. It could be shattered or inner plastic may have fused with the vinyl due to being near heat. A few times I've seen sellers admit they do not know the quality since it is sealed. Sometimes you'll find a seller who will open the record to ensure, verify, and properly grade, and this does not automatically demote to NM (in Goldmine or otherwise). Mint should be extremely rare, new records are almost never mint due to shipping, handling, and pressing.

EX(+/-) is used extensively inside the US and if you search for records on eBay or in record shops you may come across it. It fills the gap between VG+ and NM that goldmine is potentially missing (depending on who you ask).

Lately I have been recording and isolating the noise profiles from albums to get a better idea of the actual quality. I had to proactively refund a buyer who got a record that I listed as NM visually and assumed it played fine, but after re-assessing the noise profile I realized I had missed many loud clicks and pops throughout both sides and downgraded it to VG.

I want more honest sellers, myself included, this is a collectors market and folks need to step up or expect buyers to request refunds. Precise grading is an annoying necessity."
vinyl,ffa21gr,t1_ff9j89b,1579726308.0,"The grading system is flawed. We need Jacket, Visual media, and Audible media grading. A record can be near mint, but play like a VG. I've been recently burned with a EX+ disc that plays like G+. You cannot possibly grade a disc accurately without playing it."
vinyl,ffa1uv4,t1_ff9cxjg,1579726202.0,"I remember as punishment my dad would make me watch spaghetti westerns with him. I look back more fondly now on them since I've since learned how rewatch-able they all are.

My dad gave me his copy of the good, bad, and the ugly vinyl soundtrack and I don't recall it being a poor press. My cover looks slightly different too. Great album to play while cleaning, wah wah wah"
VinylMePlease,ff88qf4,t3_em0fog,1579669284.0,"Unfortunately I received two damaged copies of Remember My Song and I don't think I'm going to be buying their standalone releases again. The cover splitting is in the exact same places. I know it's going to keep happening if I request yet another replacement.

Quite frustrated. FWIW the Songs for the Deaf album came in perfect condition, thank god."
sanfrancisco,ff7yt8w,t1_ff7b4lx,1579661607.0,"Umami is bad, and their name just fuels my contempt for them. I wouldn't go so far to call their Impossible burger vile though. Just not worth the money compared to the competition."
audiophile,fehc76d,t3_ep264c,1579113556.0,The spelling and grammar mistakes make this incredibly hard to read and trust. I'm guessing (hoping) the OP of the linked post is ESL.
vinyl,fe42ilk,t1_fe344ua,1578855113.0,Lost in Space soundtrack has a really cool horizontal wrap around OBI. I may have bought it partially because of that :-p
sanfrancisco,fe06gra,t1_fe05ss9,1578804269.0,"I just walked through the Tenderloin recently so it's still fresh on my mind. I don't think it's worth debating any further about which cities have it worse. In my limited anecdotal experience, SF has been the worse I've seen, but I can easily believe its very bad in other areas as well.

Shipping people out is definitely not a solution. Maybe public policy/perception will eventually change and there will be strict quality standards enforced in mental health facilities. That's the only ethical way I can think of ""solving"" the problem. To some, forcing people into treatment is wrong, but to me it's far more unethical to let folks literally rot away due to meth and lack of hygiene. Homeless shelters aren't going to help folks who don't even know where they are."
sanfrancisco,fe03j0o,t1_fe025zb,1578802164.0,"All the cities you listed are west coast. Due to weather and services it's pretty much a west coast issue. The cities I mentioned I've visited are from all over and not confined to this specific area. Do you ever see nation-wide coverage on East coast or mid-west encampments?

I agree with you that homelessness and mental health are not localized problems, but I'll stand by that I've never experienced anything like SF's problem. You don't have to go looking for it here, it's everywhere.

Also, please don't take my attitude as taking a dump on SF, but it's annoying how cavalier and defensive folks get when you call out how big of an issue it is."
sanfrancisco,fe003ve,t1_fdzynli,1578799869.0,"Okay I concede, SF doesn't have a unique problem. Everything is normal."
sanfrancisco,fdzmm92,t1_fdyemye,1578791761.0,"I can't think of any other city I've been to that has a scene like the Tenderloin so easily accessible. I'm not saying you're wrong, but you usually need to be off the beaten path to find encampments."
todayilearned,fdsehrm,t1_fdsdgmv,1578700852.0,"Having had both an embarrassing amount since I grew up in Maine and live in california now, I think they are really similar when cooked into something like eggs. When it comes to presentation, a spiny lobster on the table is going to freak people out, but the Maine/American lobster is cleaner and leaner looking and what most people expect when seeing a steamed crustacean."
todayilearned,fdonf5f,t1_fdol0ju,1578608710.0,"I mean if I can see a difference I'm going to tell the doctor, but a majority of them I'm saying they look the same. In many cases both are somewhat blurry, and maybe some letters are clear, but others aren't. Maybe I'm alone with my uncertainty.  


I don't get how you can call human perception objective, since by definition you are using your opinion to influence your decision on which is better."
todayilearned,fdojooq,t1_fdojfsw,1578606511.0,"I think many humans have trouble with subjective A/B. It's not like I'm lying, I just honestly struggle with holding a mental picture and doing a real-time diff between what I'm seeing and can remember. We need better hardware to make this more objective.

Also my current issue is around whether or not I should have a prism for near, far, or both. After not having one, getting one, and then getting it removed I'm starting to just accept the headaches (literal and figurative)."
todayilearned,fdofydi,t1_fdnqt9o,1578604357.0,"Considering I've had multiple optometrists change my prescription (within a year) and disagree with each other, I'm skeptical of how accurate professionals can get. I'd like to trust them like other medical professionals, but it's getting to feel like chiropractic visits. They rely on (does 1 look better than 2) over and over again. By the time they're done, I'll say whatever since I don't remember what 1 looked like anyways."

food,fd3zxeq,t1_fd3za8z,1578163103.0,"I don't mean dipping like lobster, I just mean a tiny amount on top. Steak and butter are meant to be together. The fat in wagyu does not have the same flavor as butter at all so it complements well."
food,fd3ogpl,t1_fd3divd,1578160280.0,"Kobe wagyu a5 is a breeze to cook and since its high quality you could eat it more rare than usual. The high amount of fat in it helps prevent it from quickly overcooking and drying out too.

I've cooked many of these steaks since I'm blessed to live near a butcher who gets really affordable imports.

Best thing is to sear on all sides and season with some salt and pepper. Standard simple steak stuff. I typically pair with wasabi and melted butter."

Beautiful car!"
sanfrancisco,fbfzaw5,t1_fbfyyw0,1576826796.0,"I got them from far west fungi. I pulled out the crab meat and wrapped them. Usually dipping in a sauce made of soy, vinegar, citrus, and dried chilies. The taste is peppery and as a bonus they sometimes sell finger limes which pairs beautifully well."
