aww,fci9sfo,t3_ehb706,1577659500.0,"I remember that when the first movie was released in Germany, I was absolutely captivated by the idea of my toys being able to move and live their own little lives. One day we went to McDonald's, which was a big deal for me, because my parents didn't want me to eat fast food. Anyway, they had a Happy Meal with all the important characters from the film and of course I had to have Buzz Lightyear.

For a while he became my favourite ever toy in the world, because I was absolutely certain that he was different from my other toys. Unlike the others, he was definitely a sentient being with his own hopes and aspirations. In my mind, he regularly went on adventures in my room, which seemed all the more likely because my mother secretly moved him around my room while I slept. I would go as far as marking where I put him down last with a pencil to ""make it harder"" for him to keep his nightly activities go unnoticed. 

Sure enough, my mother noticed my meticulousness and adapted the way she would move him during the night. For example, she would simply turn him around by 180 degrees to make it seem like he was getting sloppy etc.

I'm glad to see that the magic of Toy Story is still going strong even amongst the youngest generation. Happy for you, and glad that I could share my own story."

Of course, now that I've developed the superpower to infinitely grow my dick while saving countless ppls life's I only date 15/10s, lolmao. Also won a million bucks the other day while getting head by your mom. Gotta go now, my city needs me. Toodles!"
