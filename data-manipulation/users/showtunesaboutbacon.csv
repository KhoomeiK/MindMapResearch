MadeMeSmile,ffnymc4,t3_eub12t,1580072324.0,This is hilarious but I also feel bad that people are filming at the gym. Like people are just there trying to get healthy and in shape. Yeah they’re being weird af but get those goals! Doing better than I am as I sit on the couch and play video games all day

vegetarian,ffjdl4r,t3_etydoh,1579996036.0,"Great job! Beyond/lite life/impossible meat are all great meat substitutes. There’s a sausage, too. I didn’t cut meat out 100% at first. I cut out red meat first, about 3 months, then just cut the chicken out. It’s been surprisingly easy when going slowly. Good luck with the rest of your progress!"
