funny,ffa3wsf,t1_ffa251g,1579727383.0,"It should be 16va so to avoid so many ledger lines. Notes are natural C and natural B. 

The rests at the end are kinda pointless the way they’re written. 

Being 16/8 would just be a difficult time signature to count in, as it’s not what you’re used to. (Normal time signatures in X/8 are 6/8, 12/8 and are conducted as 2 beats / 4 beats respectively (as triplets) (I.e. Xxx Xxx (big X being the conducted beat, small x being the non conducted beat) or Xxx Xxx Xxx Xxx). So the 16/8 would be conducted as 5 beats and you gotta be aware of the 16th 1/3 triplet). 

A way this might make more sense is the first number determines how many beats, the second number is the kind of note. 16, 8th beat notes, or 16 quavers. 

It wouldn’t sound that great, given the tempo (2 beats a second) and it being 16/8 - would sound like a trill on B natural to C natural. 

Anyways... that’s enough writing from me, gonna go to work now."
