TrueAtheism,fdnzi3g,t1_fdnmoht,1578596010.0,"The idea with keto as I understand it is that there are basically two modes of metabolism. The ""normal"" mode utilizes carbs and the ""starvation"" mode utilizes ketones which are sourced from fat. In starvation mode, appetite is suppressed, resulting in lower caloric intake, and body fat is more readily converted to ketones."
TrueAtheism,fdnfgeh,t1_fdm5nxf,1578584674.0,"I'm just speculating as to the cause of their wrong argument. In both cases they're committing a fallacy based on their inability to conceptualize an alternative. It's basically an [argument from incredulity] (https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument_from_incredulity). 

I'm speculating but maybe they did have some evidentiary basis for rejecting heavier than air flight. I strongly suspect they did not. Similarly there is no evidentiary basis in the watchmaker argument."

TrueAtheism,fderlq6,t1_fder22x,1578345150.0,I think his/her point is that both the watchmaker argument and the argument against heavier than air machines suffered from the same problem: lack of imagination.
