DaystromInstitute,fgvhi0h,t1_fgvfza1,1581149035.0,"I see, when you're saying ""openly use cloaking devices"" you mean each cloaking device itself being used openly, and when I say it I mean that the use of cloaking devices as a concept is done openly. So we probably agree in principle but are just disagreeing on terminology"
DaystromInstitute,fgvfkk6,t1_fgvfcs8,1581148149.0,"Wait, what do you mean by openly use? To me that term means that the fact that you that technology isn't a secret."
DaystromInstitute,fgvf4wm,t1_fgvdz17,1581147667.0,Why's that? Everyone knew Romulans and Klingons had cloaking technology and it still worked wonders for them
DaystromInstitute,fgvf28u,t1_fgsxd6p,1581147575.0,"I'm not sure, I don't know enough to pick a specific example but in real life, often when one state ""ends"" due to inner turmoil, loss of territory, or probably even expansion of territory and reorganization, the new state, or one of the new states, becomes a ""successor state"" to the old one and generally all existing treaties and agreements still apply unless someone says otherwise. Europe would probably be a good place to look for examples of this as monarchies ended and new Republicans popped up in their place, and the two world wars dramatically shook up borders"

What makes you say this? She earned the rank of commander, and we know in the timeline of *All Good Things* that she's a captain of her own ship. I think its safe to say that Crusher has had at least one eye on advancing her career at all times.

Now, she's probably *not* the captain of the Enterprise mainly because I don't think a doctor would end up in command of the flagship. But I think discounting her for not being on the command track isn't quite right."

This seems like a sentence that the native speakers would kind of giggle over if they ever found themselves needing to say it :P"
