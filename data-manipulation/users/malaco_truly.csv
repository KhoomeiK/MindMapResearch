Samma sak bör gälla våldsbrott emot andra oförsvarbara offer - begå det inte om du vill ha en chans att själv bli försvarbar när straffet kommer.

Poängen är ju att rätten ska bevisa att han gjort det bortom allt rimligt tvivel. Om man börjar straffa folk innan de dömts kommer vi leva i ett riktigt Kafka-artat samhälle snart.
