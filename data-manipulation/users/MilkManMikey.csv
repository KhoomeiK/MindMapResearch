whatisthisthing,fgtleix,t1_fgtkxa8,1581106047.0,Thanks for the compliment. It’s now only you and I that know this in the world. Weird.
whatisthisthing,fgtk2i6,t1_fgrqsq0,1581105499.0,"I randomly send stuff to a guy I know from my hometown, he’s an illustrator and comic book artist, cosplayer etc. He’s mad about Doctor Who and has extensively drawn many pictures of every doctor over time. It just so happens that Peter Capaldi who was the current doctor at the time was in my restaurant so I jumped on FB to this guys page to print out some of his posts so Peter Capaldi could sign them. Unfortunately he hadn’t got round to drawing him yet so P. Capaldi signed pictures of past doctors.

When I got in touch with him to ask for an address to post them to him he gave me it, ever since I’ve been sending him random lots of movie memorabilia through the post with no inclination it’s me.

Always gives me a good laugh when he posts their arrival on FB saying “thanks to whoever sent me these awesome gifts”

Don’t think I’ll ever tell him. 

He was also over the moon about the signed drawings. Like beside himself excited."
