fayetteville,fegvjze,t1_fegebfl,1579103495.0,If they aren't using the lane then they are the ones merging early. Like a zipper man. Like a zipper. I will continue setting the example of the correct way to merge. As well as leaving space in front of you.
fayetteville,fefuzu9,t1_feflse6,1579066065.0,"You have it wrong. You really aren't supposed to que up early. You're supposed to utilize the full length of the lane and merge where the lane, you know, merges. The real issue here is nobody leaves space in front of them. Everyone wants to ride the ass of the car in front of them. Drive safe, leave space. It gives you better safety, better gas milage, and is better for other drivers"

MaliciousCompliance,fdp0kpx,t1_fdonmdn,1578617147.0,"""malicious"" compliance. He complied. Maliciously. Intentionally wasted time, and in turn, money. Literally the point of this sub. Not to be good, but to be bad, as a fuck you, while still being ""in compliance"""

If we forgot something, oh well, we'd just go without until next trip. Now I, a single young male, just make a list on scrap paper or my phone before I go, and forget shit half the time and say fuck it and procrastinate on that items for another several days."
MaliciousCompliance,fd7zugh,t1_fd5ka7f,1578212339.0,"To be fair, I've had my fair share of people put in notice, then not finish their notice. I'll even go so far as to get a last day from them, doesn't have to be actually 2 weeks, could be 3, 1, whatever. Then they just don't show anyways. Okay, thanks.   

So yeah I understand the sentiment of telling someone who puts in notice to just go ahead and go. I don't do it myself, but I understand that mindset."

I'll have multiple whole families come in 10 till close and order 15 pounds of wings between them. It is what it is. I just tell my crew to stop whining and get used to it cuz that's our customer base.
KitchenConfidential,fcvqlem,t1_fcvodd7,1578007875.0,"Really this is why having kitchen hours is smart. I often have to tell the kids that close my store, I don't care that it's 9:59, our hours are until 10. That means we serve until 10. 30 seconds left and a customer pulls into drive? Serve them. But it is very annoying when people come in late and just linger. Cashiers can't close down when people are still there. Having kitchen close earlier would be rather nice."
IAmA,fctpv05,t1_fctov5u,1577953392.0,Only the boneless wings are prebreaded. The fingers are breaded then immediately cooked as needed. Believe it or not the Frozen chicken is better quality.

AskReddit,fcn0pxk,t1_fcm6rqu,1577799869.0,"I think for some it's less about time and more about effort. I work in fast food. Making a meal there is super easy. By comparison cooking at home takes far more effort. It's annoying and I don't want to do it. I think it would help if more recipes had a mis en place instruction though. 

And I come from a family where we only ate out on Friday as a social thing. The rest of the week was cooking at home or leftovers."

Just, simple, no trading except directly through my approval. If there is a schedule issue, come to me. Put in your schedule requests properly. Turned out the main problem was really the last GM didn't respect schedule requests, he just copy pasted, so everyone started trading out of need. I fixed the GM side, and the crew stopped their ""solution"" since the problem no longer existed."
buildapc,fcggos1,t1_fcel8ug,1577639752.0,"Possible, but I really doubt it. To someone like this, a computer is a purchase like any other expensive equipment. They wouldn't feel comfortable taking apart the washing machine, and they don't feel comfortable opening up the computer. The computer likely was purchased as a complete unit, just like any appliance, and is treated as such, at least as far as physical interaction goes. Software and using it is a different beast."

Basically, the electrolytic material that makes the capacitor work, degrades over time. This produces various gasses (depends on the type of cap), that make it expand. Eventually they'll pop/explode."

Another important, common mistake, is if you buy a power supply, don't use your old cables. Use the ones that come with the power supply. Manufacturers don't wire them quite the same, so even if they fit, if its' the wrong cable, you could fry your motherboard. Many people, myself included, learned this the hard way."
