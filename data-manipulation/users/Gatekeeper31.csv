Bowling,feelf43,t3_eoomj7,1579036127.0,"The only Brunswick surface that is really high friction is original Anvilane really, so you could be bowling on that. Easiest way to tell is that original Anvilane does not have the indicators downlane on the 10 and 15 boards. Also, Pro Anvilane is notoriously low friction (usually why they call it Pro Anvilhang).

The Athens pattern doesn't have a lot of reverse oil in it, which could be why you're seeing a little earlier friction than most patterns of this type. Sport patterns typically never become ""wet/dry"" unless you have people throwing the absolute wrong equipment in the wrong part of the lane to start, which could be true if it's just a normal sport league.

As opposed to someone else that commented, I don't really see a problem in starting with a pin down asym. Bigger asyms generally tend to control the back part of the lane pretty well, so I'd be fine starting with that. However, with sport patterns, our moves are going to be different than house shots. We tend to use more parallel moves on sport shots, and on house shots, we want to keep our breakpoint relatively consisten, but open our angles. Opening your angles on sport isn't usually the best idea, especially with some super flat in the middle.

I don't really know what you have at your disposal as far as an arsenal, but after your Dream On, I would go to something with a little higher RG but still has some surface on it. I would stay away from shiny until you get some defined friction at the breakpoint. Depending on the number of games you bowl, you may not ever see that friction. 

The plan would be to shell down as you go, but keep using a bit of surface to blend what you're seeing."

If your family is on your back about it, ask them why they are saying you HAVE to return  to work if professionals feel you aren't ready. Traditionally workers comp doctors will try to get you back to work as soon as possible, so they have to be keeping you out for a reason; give your family those reasons.

Bowling,fe8w459,t3_eo5rx9,1578931679.0,"Depending on handicap, it's not too much of a hit overall, since the handicap for the team is still taken off of her average of 80. 

For instance, let's say your league uses a handicap system of 90% of 220. That would give you a handicap of 9 pins per game, and her a handicap of 126. If you (hypothetically) were on opposite teams and both absent, she gets 196 with her handicap and you get 209. Given that scenario, the scores are a lot closer than they would be if you were to actually bowl. I would think that normally, you would beat her by more than 13 pins. 

Even though she may lose a larger percentage off of her average, when you base it on a team game, she's not taking too much of a hit getting 196 with her handicap factored in. 

There are a lot of things the USBC needs to change, I'll give you that. But this is also the rule in the book, and I've never bowled in a league that actually uses that rule. Most of the leagues I've been in and are currently in use 10% off your average, rather than 10 pins."
Bowling,fe8u0u3,t3_eo4ihh,1578930832.0,"I would try working backwards incrementally. If you're targeting the pins now, move your target 10-15 feet closer, then practice with that target, then keep going until you're at the arrows with your targeting. 

It's really difficult to be targeting 60 feet away and move it to 15 feet away immediately. Do it in phases and it'll be a lot easier for you. 

I would also recommend keeping a log of the board your ball hits at the target. This will train your eyes and brain to keep that target in focus for longer. So each time you throw the ball, go back to your log and write down the board you aimed at and the board you hit; it'll help your concentration knowing you need to log it."

Bowling,fdry8va,t3_emuf9y,1578691478.0,"Raw Hammer Anger was a medium RG, higher differential solid (I think) symmetrical. So if you're looking for something for today's conditions that's close to what you mentioned, the Phaze II would be the closest as it's a symmetrical solid piece. The RG on the Phaze II is a little lower and so is the diff, but the cover would be stronger, so it's close.

If you're looking for something that will give you a little more pop on the back but still give you that rounder motion, the Phaze III could even be good. It will allow you to create a little more entry angle as well being a shiny hybrid with a stronger cover.

If you're looking for something that can handle a higher volume of oil, a Statement Solid would be good as you mentioned that, although it's an asymmetrical core, so you'll get a bit of a different motion out of it.

I'm 34M and the biggest hurdle I still face when going to therapy is dreading actually going and sitting there, talking to someone about my problems. Most of the time it's because I can't articulate my problems, as I just generally feel shitty and depressed/anxious, but I can't usually pinpoint why. 

But the more you go, the easier it gets. If you find a good therapist, they won't make it feel like you're just sitting there listing the things that make you unhappy. They sort of make it like a regular conversation. 

As far as the negative stigma, I think a lot of that is in the past. I know a lot of people that are free to talk to me about their therapy experiences and admit that they go. Even though we are men and we aren't supposed to feel that vulnerable in some people's eyes, it's becoming more widely-accepted. 

There is always going to be the worry that the person you choose isn't right for you, and that may happen. But do some research beforehand. There are websites that will list professionals and people review them. Also a lot of therapists will let you come for a first session and see if they're a good fit for you. 

I think it could be something that really benefits you. I know it's tough, and the first and largest hurdle is actually getting your ass there. But it's like the gym; the thought of going is dreadful but once you're there, you're going to be happy you went. Good luck!"

Bowling,fddzl0r,t1_fddneq3,1578327786.0,"I would have a PSO measure his PAP to make sure. The Armadillo is a really good tool that can get that measured pretty quickly. 

I find that while most two-handers that are high-track players have PAPs that are further right, I rarely see someone 6.5"" right, and most of the time their PAP goes down, not up. But that's not always the case. So I would definitely see if a qualified person can measure it.

That being said, you can use (mostly) traditional layouts with two-handers, especially if control is not something you're looking to achieve.

The only thing I would be careful with would be using stronger PSA distances since it sounds like he doesn't have a lot of axis tilt or axis rotation. A stronger PSA location, especially on a stronger asym ball, could make it find its axis TOO quickly and just stand up and go straight. 

If you're looking at a really strong asym ball, I would modify the layout to something like 65 or 70\* for the drilling angle, 5"" for the pin to PAP distance and probably leaving the VAL angle around 40\*. His rev rate along with his lack of tilt would require that drilling angle to be a bit bigger."

But if you're looking for somewhere to start in practice, I would start a little left of the track and try to find a defined spot where you can get your ball to recover from, and go from there.

Bowling,fcko23z,t3_ehpemf,1577729502.0,"Forward and Lateral spine tilt are going to be your savior here.

Basically what I see happening is two-fold. Your center of gravity a little far back which is eliminating all leverage you could create. When you get to the line your shoulders are back, rather than being over your knees. This causes your hand to go directly up the back of the ball quickly, eliminating rotation.

As far as your lateral spine tilt, it's not quite there, which is pulling your swing back behind you on the backswing, and away from you on the downswing. We want the opposite. We want to go out with the backswing and then creating a swing slot down toward our ankle on the downswing.

The easiest remedy I have found that people can implement is getting your head outside of the ball. So on your set up, make sure the ball is under your right shoulder. Then on the push away, you will want to get your head outside of the ball for the swing.

Here are a couple articles that visualize it better than I can explain it:

Bowling,fckkndo,t3_ehovlz,1577727402.0,"You could probably get away with just plugging the thumb and adjusting for your span. Usually about $10-$15 depending on the pro shop. Wouldn't be bad to play around with, especially if you're just learning, or if you're trying something different.

I've gotten older/used balls to try new pitches or to tweak my span a bit, so it's definitely worth trying for a somewhat minimal cost."
Bowling,fckjwwf,t3_ehoif6,1577726949.0,"A lot of times when you see loft, it's because you're ""hitting up"" on the ball. Frequently when people learn to hook the ball, they see the most initial success by over-rotating, which causes them to impart momentum upward to create rotation. What we are looking for is projection, rather than upward movement. 

It does look like there's a little over-rotation in your release. What we want to focus on, is working the inside part of the ball and keeping our fingers on the inner half (the half of the ball closest to our body) as long as we can. It takes some work, and I always link these two videos to people looking to learn, but there are two great examples of visualizing this:

[Here](https://youtu.be/N5nnDbV0znE) and [Here](https://youtu.be/tiVORM49GxA) \-- notice how the pros have their elbows and hands to the inside part of the ball, and the release and projection of the ball is out, rather than up. Hopefully that can help a bit with the visualization."
GetMotivated,fckgrmx,t3_ehn3ky,1577724977.0,"I actually prefer to do most things alone. 

I go to almost every concert alone. At first it was because most people don't like the sub-genres of metal I find myself enjoying...but now I just prefer it. I can stand where I want or move around whenever and don't have to look for anyone else in the crowd. And people at metal shows are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet. I've met some really cool people just standing there alone."
Bowling,fckezr4,t1_fckerrf,1577723846.0,It's because I have so much money ;-)
Bowling,fckevxi,t3_ehfi04,1577723779.0,I actually really like my orange vibe. I didn't think I would as I'm probably the only person in the history of time that didn't have success with any of the other Vibes. It's found a home right under my Phaze III in terms of overall motion even though it's a solid.
Bowling,fckepm4,t3_ehnv3f,1577723667.0,The $100k is a nice consolation prize though.
Bowling,fck9tej,t3_ehmx8f,1577720413.0,"Until you stand over the treasure trove of balls in your garage staring, wondering which ones to take to league and the whole drive there you're second-guessing yourself...then you start the night open open and go ""should've brought the other balls"" hahah

Hyroad X is a good piece though!"
