I smoke pot on a regular basis. Half a joint when I get home from work to de-stress and forget about my day, and then the other half before bed so that my brain stops overthinking all that I am thinking about and I can fully relax to sleep. I find the dreams on Keppra are CRAZY! and smoking helps me pass completely out and I don't think as much."

I have the most Amazing girlfriend who I love and we face time every day and we laugh. but it is my job... and I can't handle the negativity around here. it is like I suck it in and it affects me and I can't drop it.  but I am afraid to leave and get a new job, because if I have another seizure there I forget everything and dont want to do that around a new job and forget everything I learned... right now I have lots of notes and things to relearn.. there are so many things to be scared of that ""could"" happen..."
