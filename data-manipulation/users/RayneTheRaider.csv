LearnUselessTalents,fh8whkw,t1_fh8vz3y,1581368799.0,A little googling shows there are two ways to pronounce R. Retroflex and Bunched. Both are correct. I use retroflex I think. Bunched seems more difficult but maybe that's because I am not used to it.
LearnUselessTalents,fh8vz3y,t1_fh8u792,1581368496.0,Yes and i have no idea how you could make it with the tongue touching the roof. I tried and it makes a strange sound
LearnUselessTalents,fh8qx8f,t1_fgt9nc6,1581365534.0,This is terrible advice. The tongue should be thrust backwards in your mouth without touching the roof or bottom of your mouth. Bonus points if you can make it into a spoon shape

After I got the job I found out they had no real goal for hiring me they just had money to burn from investors. I was constantly blocked from performing my job from upper leadership and as a result never really did what they hired me to do just tried to make myself useful in other ways. I was asked by my own VP how he could get the design team to stop being a speed bump for development (I was on Ux team as a researcher). He seemed to think all the business consultants they hired to be product owners should be designing the product. If you don’t think I’m exaggerating they laid them all off about a year after I left and now operate without any designers. It was a very hostile work environment, very little professionalism people would get in yelling matches, just walk in on each other’s meetings. I hear there was even some financial fraud going on. 0/10 would recommend anyone have that experience"

findapath,fgghpdd,t1_fgghekf,1580762097.0,"Research and program management roles. They generally won't tell you what went wrong.
What I know is 
1) I wasn't prepared enough for technical interviews
2) they wanted someone more technical 
3) just told me they liked me but said they decided to go with someone else. Didnt reccomend me for any other roles
4) said I wasn't a good culture fit after the 2nd phone interview"
findapath,fggfwd5,t1_fggfezg,1580761023.0,"That's some great insight. Maybe it's the way I'm taking some people's comments. For example someone saying ""you need to get more experience at smaller companies"" at first made me mad like they were talking to someone fresh out of college. So I tried to explain that I do actually have a lot of experience. That advice is especially hard to take when I look on LinkedIn and I see a girl at one of these companies with the same job I have been rejected for who has a degree in folk lore and no tech experience at all.

I am trying to veil things because I do want to maintain some level of anonymity."
findapath,fggetmh,t1_fgge8y8,1580760379.0,"Thank you. That much rejection can really mess with your head and from what I have read online getting turned away for ""culture fit"" at some of these companies is supposed to be the kiss of death. So it's nice to hear otherwise"

findapath,fggdbbw,t1_fggcx9k,1580759467.0,I think the difficulty here is trying to somewhat maintain some anonymity. I'd be happy to get more specific in DMs. I actually have some very specific skillsets that would make it really easy to figure out who I am if I went into detail. Definitely not trying to humblebrag by name dropping if anything I'm pretty embarrassed.
findapath,fggbkxm,t1_fggbg4s,1580758405.0,Agree. Honestly my education isn't impressive to most people. I'm just trying to be generic enough to maintain some anonymity but specific enough to paint a picture

He has to maintain control of the bus and be aware of the road. Kids misbehaving in the back are a danger to him doing that. I dont know if I would have done anything differently. I dont blame the bus driver but they should probably ban the misbehaving kids from the bus. If parents can't teach their kids to behave in a moving vehicle they can drive them to school
