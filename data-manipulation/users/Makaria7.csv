AmItheAsshole,ff5q09u,t1_ff56kbw,1579605467.0,"It wouldn’t necessarily be spite. OP said she’d likely never get paid back from her sister. This way, she gets her money back immediately, or some of it, and the sister would then have a chance to customize the service to better suit her tastes. 

If she lets her sister take over her wedding, it will be her money wasted on an event that’s no longer hers. It would be like rubbing salt into a wound to attend that wedding. I can’t even imagine the feeling of walking into a venue I paid for, seeing decor I paid for, eating food I paid for, listening to the DJ I paid for, etc all for a wedding that was supposed to be mine. Instead, I’d get to watch my sister get MY wedding at, largely, MY expense?

And if we want to talk about class, how classy was it if the sister to hijack OP’s wedding, services, and guests AND THEN ask OP if that was okay???  Clearly, sister doesn’t have much respect for OP’s feelings or empathy about the situation. Otherwise, she’d never try to turn her sister’s pain into her own joy.

Advice,ff3fuie,t3_erc563,1579540189.0,"I’ve see a few people mention it, but calling will really help in your case. My son got his job at Walmart by applying, waiting a few business days, and then calling to request an interview.

Especially in high turnover places like WM, Target, fast food, setting yourself apart by taking the initiative could really work in your favour. It shows you’re eager to work. I’m not suggesting you spam their lines (so people don’t yell at me). Calling during a reasonable hour and asking to speak with the manager is not harassment. If they’re not there, it’s always better to ask for when is a good time to reach them rather than leaving a message. 

Also keep in mind that, for large companies like WM, each department can have their own managers that determine if they need more staff. My son has one manager he reports to and a backup if he’s out that day. In this case, it would be good if you have/can make a contact in the store before calling so you know what departments might be needing help.

Good Luck!"

Parenting,feng652,t3_eq22la,1579283980.0,"You have a rough few years ahead of you. My son only just started to even out emotionally at 18. Side note, he’s been working since he was 16.......at Walmart!

But first, any parent who honestly reflects on their parenting style/choices and wonders if they’re a good parent is a GOOD PARENT! That means you’re aware of your limitations and do not believe yourself incapable of making mistakes. That’s an amazing quality to have. If you weren’t like this, you’d probably end up seeing a story on here about you being a Karen/Kevin type since they’re never wrong, they’re perfect and so are their kids.

Your son isn’t thinking about how hard you work at your job or what the money you make does to support the family and your lifestyle. That’s normal for a lot of teenagers. You didn’t fail him bc he has these opinions/feelings. We’ve all been that kid embarrassed by the job their parents had or the clothes our parents were able to afford (in my case, they were hand-me-downs from my 4yr older sister who also got them hand-me-down from a lady my mom worked for.)

You just need to wait out this phase. It will pass. Although your son is still developing and maturing, you can begin to speak to him as if he were soon to become an adult (bc he is). I did this with my son and he eventually started to understand, I hope, more about adult life/struggles. 

If you want to be punitive, you could always refuse him access to things your embarrassing job pays for since it’s so awful that his dad has a steady job that helps support the household. However, that would require your wife to be on board to decide what amenities he no longer has access to since you pay for it. (I’m thinking like Netflix or soda/snacks/pizza nights/etc.) This is totally something I would have done bc I’m a bit of an A-hole if I had reached my limit with my son. Thankfully, it never got that far and he’s very emotionally mature now, minus getting mad if we don’t send out a search party for his grocery list before we go shopping. (He’s responsible for his own snacks/drinks and he knows it’s on him to send me his list if he wants me to grab his stuff for him.)

Bottom line, you’re working hard, you love your son and this phase will pass. If you’re trying to reach out, and getting nothing in return, drop it. He will come around when he’s ready. For your daughter, like other posts said, introduce a routine daddy/daughter time, fairly often to start, to talk with her, play, ear ice cream, whatever she wants within reason. She will get used to opening up to you and feel very special.

YOU GOT THIS!"

Anyways, the campground belonged to a friend of the groom and he was letting them reserve the whole space for the wedding,

Our invitation told us we would need to pay to camp or pay for a hotel nearby (bc it wasn’t close to where anyone lived and was a wedding weekend). Also, even though we needed to bring our own food/drinks/supplies, there would be chefs hired that could cook your food for you. Everyone camping had to chip in for them, even if we didn’t use them.

Parenting,fcxcu4j,t3_ejaveh,1578059452.0,"Here’s my take:

Our son is 18 and he pays rent. It’s not about not spoiling him or tough love. 

I grew up in a family that didn’t talk about finances. My school was a little one that didn’t offer courses on budgets/finances/etc. As a result, the moment I hit 18 and got credit card offers, I started down a path that was hard to change. I wasn’t informed about interest and payback and minimum balance or anything. I struggled with bills and debt (having utilities cut off, payday loans, threats to evict, you get the idea) until I was 30. Knowing I was about to immigrate gave me the drive to clear it all up and start fresh with my husband in a new country.

Because of all this, I started talking to my son at a young age about finances. I talked about the importance of budgets and prioritizing bills over fun and living within means. We talked about the benefits and risks of credit cards and everything else I could think of that I had learned the hard way.

He got a summer ‘job’ at 14 selling candy bars door to door and bought himself a computer while putting money aside for savings.

When he graduated high school, we told him we wanted him to start paying rent. (We pay for his tuition/books for school.) He pays for his cell phone which is on our plan to keep his cost low. He pays for his monthly bus pass to get to work/school. He also pays for his groceries that he wants specific to his taste. Like snacks or soda. 

Half of his rent, I put aside in a savings account for him to use as he thinks important. Originally, he wanted to use it for future university costs. In November, he talked about needing to make some computer upgrades. Short story, he decided to use some of his savings to buy a new system. He didn’t come close to using all his savings and didn’t affect his monthly budget at all.

We’ve noticed, over the years, that he takes better care of the items he pays for versus how he cared for things we bought him. Like his shoes or a backpack. He understands now the importance of taking care of his things and taking care of his bills before pleasure. He understands that big ticket items are attainable through a little discipline and patience.

At 18, he is so smart about his finances and we are so proud of him taking these good steps into adulthood. So, for us, having him pay rent was essential to him really understanding the struggles/decisions he would face once he moved out of our home.

That being said, I don’t think paying bills is necessarily right for every teen. I think it depends on their financial maturity and how they learn. Our son really benefited from applying the lessons we’ve taught him. 

If your child is mature about their spending and understands the financial decisions they will have to make once they move out, then you’ve more than done your job as a parent! No one wants to live in a payday loan cycle or “will they cut my electricity today” pattern!"

That way, she gets to have some control (at your discretion) and might feel more confident in her daily behaviour.

Fast forward to 2012, I married my husband (who knew I had had the procedure. It didn’t take long for him to start talking about wanting a little daughter... A little backstory, my son and I immigrated to Canada after the wedding since my husband lives there.

So even though I didn’t want more children, (at this point my son is 12), I told him I would consider in vitro after the immigration process was complete, as long as I was still under 35. This was under the assumption that we would qualify for the payment assistance offered in the province for couples who needed in vitro. 

When we found out I wouldn’t qualify, it was like I had ruined his life for a while. I feel badly for him not having the chance to carry on his family line. But i was up front about my situation and the fact that I didn’t want more kids. 

We’ll be married 8 years next March. I’m 37 now. He had a recent health situation that I think put in perspective that it’s better for us to focus on ourselves and not with trying to procreate.
