People in thos territory can either sink back into the quicksand of depression, or they can graplpple whatever they can and use as much fortitude as they have to move upward and forward.

Sports physical therapists call thos the breaking point.  When Marshawn Lynch was qual' for the NFL, he reached a point in his workouts where they said he could either just maintain his workouts and keep at the same physical performance on the field, or he could explode with energy and reach a new level of strength training and energy on the field.  The physical therapists call this explosion of energy ""field focus"", where the player sets his mind to break tye plateau and push into another level of performance on the fieldds.

Scientists were asked what causes this phenomenon, thay wrre told that it is pure mindset that is ingrained into their psyche from the beginning.

I am a warrior. I am confident. I am successful. I will not fallback into the pit of darkness I was in before. I will grab into every hand hold I can to pull myself out of this depression.  Then I will walk--no run away from that hole as far as I can get. When I see others approaching that hole, I WILL YELL ""HEY! HEY YOU! WATCH OUT FOR THAT 60 FOOT DEEP CAVERN!! ITS TERRIBLE TO GET OUT!

I AM CONFIDENT.

I AM VICTORIOUS.

I AM MAN."

Then I stand outside and put my hand on my pulse.  I hug myself and thank myself for doing good to my body.  I thank myself for showering up (I use ivory soap) and brushing my teeth. I thank tge universe for providing my needs and the amazing breakfast I had.  I thank myself for taking care of my body. Then I go talk with people Up and out of the house.  I k ow that it totally suck to be there, just say thank you to yoyrself for tye little things."
