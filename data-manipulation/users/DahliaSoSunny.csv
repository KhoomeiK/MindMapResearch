niceguys,ff390mh,t1_ff2lb7n,1579536533.0,Yeah this really sounded like a teenager to me WTF.
dogs,ff36n31,t3_erdszn,1579534944.0,"I have both cats and dogs and some serious mental health diagnoses. IMO cats are much easier to care for if you’re just looking for companionship and snuggles. When we got our dog I thought she might encourage me to get out more but it did NOT work out that way and dogs are a ton of work. I have family that does most of the dog work though, so if you don’t have anyone to pick up the slack in dog care for you, I wouldn’t recommend getting a dog.

ETA: maybe you can set this up as a goal for yourself? Before you get a dog, start going for regular walks. Push yourself to do all the things you would be doing with a dog, with the ultimate goal of getting one once better habits are set in place. That way you’ll know you’re up to the task and can eventually get one."
aww,ff2ild5,t3_er30on,1579507737.0,We call this look “the raptor eyes” at our house.
AmItheAsshole,ff2ht1d,t1_ff1smkv,1579506737.0,"Yes, for real. This is a seriously fucked up thing to do to a mother of a newborn. Every fiber in her body is screaming for her baby. It’s hormonal, there isn’t anything that can be done about it. The baby is two weeks old, you’ll have PLENTY of time to bond and do other father-baby stuff once the hormones start to wear down at a pace that is comfortable for your wife. Jesus Christ, I don’t know what made you think this was acceptable OP. 

YTA."
mentalhealth,ff2fj1b,t1_ff26v34,1579503981.0,This. I’ve described it before as feeling like a ghost.
CPTSD,ff2ffar,t3_er66bo,1579503861.0,"I will completely shut down if someone says this stuff to me. It’s very “tough love” (that’s how they think of it anyway) and I don’t respond well to it at all, as I imagine is the case for anyone with trauma. I’ve even had other abuse victims tell me this. It can be really confusing when you start internalizing these things because you start believing you’re compliant with your own victimization somehow. It’s like being repeatedly punched in the face and having someone ask “Why are you letting that person punch you in the face? Stop being such a victim” what the fuck."
CPTSD,ff2f5xx,t1_ff2cltz,1579503563.0,"Totally and sometimes, depending on who it’s coming from, it comes across like “Well if what I just said didn’t fix you than you obviously aren’t trying, I’ve done I can do here, I’m washing my hands of this!”"
TalesFromYourServer,ff1w4sc,t1_ff1vyg6,1579487522.0,"Yeah that’s what I mean, maybe she expected them to be like lazily home cooked eggs?? I’m always desperate to make sense of bad customer nonsense. Usually useless to try."
TalesFromYourServer,ff1vuet,t3_er5h8x,1579487332.0,"I’m trying to make this all make sense in my head, because WTF, not excusing her behavior but: were the eggs well mixed? The ONLY thing I can think of is that generally eggs made at home aren’t as well mixed as scrambled eggs you get at a restaurant, they have little slivers of egg white throughout. Maybe? That’s all I got."
abortion,ff1gbim,t3_er4c26,1579478775.0,I remember reading this over a decade ago. Still just as powerful today as it was then. There has been some progress but this particular phenomenon hasn’t budged.
Parenting,ff03y6i,t3_eqxpt5,1579464912.0,I have a 13 year old daughter as well. Lovely. I would treasure that forever.
FundieSnark,fezvsnk,t1_fez2uw5,1579462304.0,"I came here to say this. Whether intentional or not, it’s a way of distancing themselves from the problem to avoid any of the blame. Basically “that’s not my problem”."
casualiama,fezslxa,t1_fezsc99,1579461123.0,Do you or any relatives have other related sleep issues? Like sleepwalking? I’m not super educated on this but I’ve read a bit that they’re all connected. My daughter sleep-walked (slept-walk?) as a toddler and I have some sleep paralysis issues.
shittytattoos,fezsbv2,t3_eqw2so,1579461019.0,My 13 year old has got it in her head to tattoo herself lately. I should start collecting these bad teen tattoo ideas for her lol. Or more of the “I seriously regret this” stories.
casualiama,fezrynm,t3_eqyimj,1579460882.0,"Dang, good for you man. All open about it. My parents wet the bed well in their late teens and so did I. My teenager still does occasionally. I’ve never even considered it to be a medical issue, just a weird sleep thing. 

A handful of times a year I’ll get these super vivid dreams of me getting out of bed to use the toilet, only waking up mid-pee realizing I’m still in bed. Is that your experience? 

I’m super embarrassed about it though, I will probably delete this later lol."

AskReddit,feyqq8f,t1_fexkqxc,1579449318.0,"This reminds me of one of the last voicemails I have from my mother. I had my Facebook privacy settings set up to where I had to approve messages before they were displayed on my wall. She called me on my birthday and some of the message goes like this, “Happy Birthday! I sent you lots of messages, online, I sent you a card but it’s like they’re going away or something. I don’t get it.” It’s my favorite voicemail. She died in 2014 but her Facebook confusion still makes me giggle every time."
OCD,fescx2k,t1_fes8wnm,1579363960.0,"What the fuck. Sure, tv “helps” but as soon as I shut it off the thoughts come creeping back in."
myfavoritemurder,fes3xyf,t3_eqbdef,1579361138.0,"Seems some people are missing the point. This is a good option for when you’re feeling unsafe just saying “no”. Ideally, a plain “no” SHOULD be sufficient, but I’ve been in situations where I was followed for several blocks downtown at night because I wouldn’t give out my number. This option might help avoid those situations. It’s a sad reality but some men react violently upon hearing “no”."
raisedbynarcissists,fery91n,t3_eqgcgb,1579359562.0,"Preach! I really relate to this. My dad was this way, always telling us how much worse he had it. I deserved better and so does my child. So I don’t abuse her! It’s not even hard."
dogs,feogl1c,t1_fenio2u,1579299888.0,"I was with her up until that moment, like maybe the airport is exaggerating or falsifying the reports. Then seeing the dog on the leash sealed the deal. That is NOT a service dog, not even one in training."

dogs,feljh63,t1_felix2o,1579223657.0,Ooo that IS a fun fact!
dogs,feljdvz,t1_feliyjx,1579223593.0,"Ooooff to that last sentence. And I’m not entirely sure about the tail, it just seems shorter than you would expect in a dog of her size. Just proportionally it seems off, and her tail doesn’t come to a point, it’s more blunt on the end. So I think you’re right, it could be from an old injury. I wasn’t sure if the teeth or the tail was relevant or not, it wasn’t something her previous owner discussed with us and it took me a little while to notice actually."
dogs,feliot9,t1_felij0t,1579223111.0,Thank you. I just googled and I can definitely see a resemblance! I showed SO and he hadn’t heard of that breed either so we hadn’t considered it.
dogs,feliaio,t1_felhzqs,1579222834.0,"I’ll definitely check that out! And I’m obsessed with how pretty she is, I think she should be like a dog food brand ambassador or something lol. She’s got these awesome, wavy butt curtains lol. That’s what we call them anyway."

dogs,felh79x,t1_felghme,1579222092.0,Thanks! She’s definitely got that “shepherd” look to her so I know that’s one at least. I hadn’t considered lab before though or GSD.
NarcissisticAbuse,fekslh1,t3_epjv2n,1579206740.0,"When my ex husband got his second divorce, his newest ex wife and I started talking. She confirmed pretty much everything I thought that he thought about me. He’d told her tons of stories about how crazy I was. She really wants to (and I think has actually attempted to) warn his current girlfriend. I felt weirdly responsible for their awful relationship and I told her I wish I had warned her but she told me there is no way she would have listened to anything I would have said because he’d already planned for that by all his shit talking. And I know that’s true for me as well, if someone had tried to warn me I wouldn’t have listened. 

Point is, you don’t need to do any warning. It isn’t your responsibility to run out in front of him waving a red flag. He’s responsible for his own actions and there’s little we can do to prevent them from hurting anyone else."

CPTSD,fekfbfj,t1_fek83ug,1579198849.0,"The same reason one person can smoke and get cancer and someone else who smokes their whole life never does. Or someone is abused as a child and ends up a serial killer and someone else who is abused ends up an empathetic, fully functional human. It’s truly a combination of nature and nurture and even then humans are unpredictable."
CPTSD,fekezy1,t3_epjrg5,1579198660.0,"“She thinks I’m lying”

In order to maintain their belief that they are always right, you MUST be lying. Lying to yourself and to professionals who agree with you. When I left my narc ex I had to stay at an abused women’s shelter for awhile and he went on and on about how I MUST HAVE lied to get in. This was years ago and he still tells people this. 

They’re truly incapable of apologies because they will never accept they’ve done anything wrong."
abortion,fek9xx3,t3_eplmva,1579195667.0,"I’m not sure my story is what you’re looking for because there are some differences but I had an abortion, as a mom already, when my child was about two years old. I wasn’t in a good relationship but even if I had been, I just felt like it wasn’t the right time. My daughter was still very “baby”, we were still nursing and she slept with me and I couldn’t imagine having another baby on top of it all. It was hard making that choice having just gone through a pregnancy and having a child, it was hard to separate my unwanted pregnancy from the one I did want and went through with (if that makes sense). This was all over ten years ago, I did go through with the abortion and while I had some difficult feelings about it in the beginning, I’m very content now that I made the right decision for me and my family and I have no regrets. I hope you can find some peace soon, I’m sorry you’re going through this."

NarcissisticAbuse,fehj4lr,t1_fehilfp,1579117594.0,"It’s not so much that I have no one to talk to, ever. I do have support now. I’m just dealing with the panic that creeps up when I find myself in need of someone to talk to and everyone just happens to be unavailable by chance. It feels terrifying."
NarcissisticAbuse,fehiejt,t1_fehhx6y,1579117172.0,"Yeah that is definitely my experience with my narc. Even after we divorced, he would come around my work and hang out with all my coworkers. It’s been awhile since he was THAT involved but the damage is done and it still floats over my head. I still worry about his influence over people in my life."
NarcissisticAbuse,fehhr8n,t1_fehh4bw,1579116789.0,"It’s been years since I’ve been with my narc ex (though we have a kid so I still have to deal with him ALL the time). He did keep me super isolated when we were married. He was military. I couldn’t have a job, I couldn’t drive our car. We shared a cell phone and he took it with him to work. Sometimes he’d cut the internet off if he thought I wasn’t keeping the house clean enough. I’ve never connected those feelings with how I feel now though when I’m alone. Do you think that hollow feeling could be related to the time I spent isolated with him 10 years ago?"
badwomensanatomy,fehgohb,t1_fehfxik,1579116160.0,"You can sit in your house and never drive on a road but you still have to pay for the roads via taxes. Continuing the analogy, even if you don’t use the roads, you still benefit from them (you’d likely have to have things delivered, etc) and literally everyone benefits when people are healthier. People like that are the first to complain when someone is sniffling and coughing in the office or their kid picks up a bug at school from another kid. Okay, well maybe if they had access to doctors and medicine this would be much less of an issue lol."
gaslighting,fehfd4h,t3_ep611p,1579115390.0,"This is like when someone compliments you and you say “thank you” and they get mad you didn’t fall all over yourself telling them how great they were for giving a compliment. Your reaction with the smiley face was cute and sweet, he doesn’t get to demand a different reaction. Very unfair of him."
dogs,fehehc4,t3_ep5jpm,1579114874.0,"From an objective standpoint, it’s absolutely time. She’s most certainly feeling some pain. And I’m sure she is happy because it sounds like you’ve provided a very loving and caring home for her. If she were my dog, I’d be struggling with this decision as well. She’s lived a long life though, you’ve shared lots of love and the most loving thing you can do for her at this point is let her go. I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. There’s nothing I can say that will make it hurt any less but I hope you can find some confidence and peace with this decision with the reassurances here."
SelfAwarewolves,fehbisu,t1_fegxtbj,1579113156.0,"I read this first thing this morning and, as someone who doesn’t follow the royal family, was fucking blown away. I mean, maybe it was more obvious to people paying attention. But holy shit."
ihavesex,fehb2hl,t1_feh6e2a,1579112882.0,I was so confused by this post but this someone makes me all come together. It’s still a WTF but at least I’m less baffled and can laugh now.
insaneparents,feh8ctm,t1_fegtr06,1579111251.0,"Came here to say this. The difference though is that if you don’t get the flu shot and you do get the flu, the chances of you passing it on to someone who will then have complications is greater than zero. But if you get the flu shot, complications or not, the chances of you passing on those complications to someone else is zero. Also, far less likely to contract the flu and then pass it on to someone else."
badwomensanatomy,feh7mb8,t1_feh3f4f,1579110822.0,"Also also, paying for other people’s healthcare is kind of how private insurance already works. It’s not like they take only the money you pay every month and put that on a tab for you. You pay into it and when you need they pay your bill from everyone’s money. Only with private insurance you pay more because the insurance company is cutting themselves a fat profit. I don’t understand why people think this is a better system."
