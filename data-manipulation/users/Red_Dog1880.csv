And Antwerp never said that, all they said was not to travel if you don't have a ticket. Nowhere did they say it was to do with fan behaviour or anything else you're imagining. It's a standard message that all clubs give to their fans before European games."

We've been pretty decent over the years compared to other fans in Belgium and Holland (not perfect), there's no valid reason to ban an entire away support apart from being a cowardly mayor. The fact you think it's normal shows how used you seem to have gotten to being treated like scum."
soccer,ffd19fp,t1_ffczvu5,1579811431.0,Nonsense. If that's your argument your own fans shouldn't be welcome anywhere given the long list of incidents (even just a few days ago) . Nobody is condoning what happened in the home game but there's nothing to indicate something would have happened in Enschede and to just blanket ban all away fans is pathetic. Which is why I don't want this BeNeLiga because it'll be like that everywhere.
soccer,ffcve2l,t3_esx52t,1579808054.0,Dutch police and local authorities won't like this I think. Given how draconic fans are treated in the Netherlands and things like Antwerp fans being banned in Enschede in their Europa League qualifier...
