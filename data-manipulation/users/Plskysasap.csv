OnTheBlock,felb7pz,t3_ent8kq,1579218102.0,"The problem isn't sleeping. The problem is the institution and the departments not wanting to spend money. Stop blaming officers for being human.

&nbsp;

Let me clarify and give you a realistic perspective. 3rd shift is a skeleton crew, meaning it's the shift with the smallest number of officers. It leads up to 1st shift, the shift with the *largest* number of officers. So guess what happens when a facility is understaffed? Or even if a few officers on 1st shift call off? Yeah, those officers get ordered to work 1st shift. It's not uncommon for the entire 3rd shift to be forced to work 1st shift. 

This happens. Every. Single. Day. These officers are working two full time jobs, whether they want to or not. There is no saying no to being ordered if you want to stay employed. So they work 16 hour days every day, with a day off every week or two; yeah, I won't get into pre-orders here, which would blow your mind even more. After driving to and from the facility, eating, showering, etc. They might get 3 or 4 hours of sleep, if you ignore your family and life completely and just focus on the basics of surviving. This begins to wear on a human body. You'll begin to hyper focus on walking. You'll begin to intermittently lose consciousness- actually fall asleep - while walking or standing. You are essentially a mildly coherent corpse. 

&nbsp;

Somehow through all this, the public and the DOC seem to think it's lazy, stupid officers that are the problem. Not the understaffing issues that the prisons continue to let run rampant. Not the low pay that doesn't attract enough people. Not the rigid structure, unforgiving nature, or life altering liability in everything you do.

&nbsp;

So you know what? If that 3rd shift officer wants to take a 15 minute nap between rounds while the inmates are all sleeping locked in their cells, before he has to report to his 1st shift post in the morning; more power to him. Let me be clear when I say **Corrections Officers are human beings, with human limitations and basic human needs**."
