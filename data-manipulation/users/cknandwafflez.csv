I dread my three days off in a row, Sunday/Monday/Tuesday. I bartend so I get home late Saturday, after fake smiling and making other people happy for days, so Sunday I decompress- its my zombie day. Of course, my friends are all 9-5 people..so Monday, Tuesday theres usually not much socializing ( I try to keep myself busy but Im usually a little blue from not having left my house on Sunday.)  Other than boxing on Monday (NIGHT!! Have to get through the entire day!!) and therapy on Tuesday, Im not out of the house for much more than that. Ive recently started volunteering, and I also try to force myself to sit in the coffee shop for a while.  Usually by Wednesday morning I feel terrible."

If she was on antidepressants it would have just made her mania/hypomania worse, escalate quickly and probably higher than usual, would also more than likely prolong it. Antidepressants alone dont manage bipolar, because its not a chemical imbalance like unipolar depression is. Different parts of the brain literally shut down at different points in the cycle.

The two hosts are hysterical, and each week they cover a topic from history, usually a very peculiar one (ex: the history of barbed wire), and the backstory is usually already ridiculous/funny on its own, but the hosts really add to it.  Some stand-out ones are episode 404 ""Jan Pieterzon"", basically about people killing each other over nutmeg; Episode 207 ""The Animal Horror of Macquarie Island"", which is about how some lunatic scientists were trying to control the cat population and kept introducing new or more animals into the mix and it just snowballed into a wild ride; Episode 2 ""Purity Balls"", about young women pledging their virginity and some weeeeeeeirddddd stuff.

Also, I'm not saying this to be rude or anything at all, but I really wish there was a version of this sub (AND the bipolar subs I follow)  for people over say 22 years.  I say this only because, as a 32 year old.  I find it very hard to relate to most of these posts, and when I do respond or give advice, the person actually ends up being much younger/lives with their folks so my advice isn't helpful.  People who are past college age (or really even still in college) are in much, much different places in their lives than the people in high school sitting at home suffering from depression.

BipolarReddit,fediw5q,t1_fed8xhi,1579012673.0,"This is perfect.  From signs to solutions.

I had a very long explanation of how my mood journal helps and how I use it, but I scratched that.   
 For the most part I know I will be turning a corner into extreme depression eventually when I'd rather be inside than outside, can't find the point in socializing, can't read, everything bores me, and I'm writing things like ""I HATE EVERYONE"" in my mood journal.   And so, as the other person says, I have an attack plan.  It has to start with me forcing myself to eat, and then everything else falls into place.  I SWEAR TO GOD THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.  I knew it was important, and my psychiatrist will check on me to see if I'm eating when I'm bad, and my reaction was always 'uhhhhhhhhhhh, this can't save me"".  So eat, forced socialization, dragging myself to the boxing gym, getting to bed before a certain time no matter what (tricky one cause I work in a bar/restaurant). For the most part, these are things mentioned anywhere and everywhere, but it's just the solid truth.  I also get ahead of myself in case it doesn't work and I plummet:  I make sure to tidy up my house before I leave every day so it's actually nice to come home to, and I do a task here and there like mop or dust on top of tidying up, a load of laundry, scrub the tub.  Something, anything.  I have a small list of three 5 min tasks every morning to to keep me going: stretch, mood journal, make bed.  Having three tiny tasks to complete will help boost your motivation.  ""Motivation Follows Action""

This worked well for me the last time as I was dragging myself out of a horrible depressive episode, so I'm sure it would work the other way around.  I also found that limiting my screen time (which I already sort of do) more strictly was awesome as well."

I read a handful of bipolar books and consumed everything on the internet, and this was the most comprehensive thing Ive come across, very easy to read too.  My therapist and psychiatrist have been helpful, but this book has just given me so much info, from understanding exactly what bipolar is and how it effects different parts of the brain at different times, to coping mechanisms, and throughout the whole book they have examples and quotes of real people, which helps understand the spectrum of bipolar, and how episodes in people differently, and how they cope."

You are absolutely right."
depression,fe3g2kr,t3_enosxw,1578848961.0,"So, your first session they will ask you questions and talk a little more, and they'll take some notes; they usually only take notes the first session or two.  Your first session they will also ask you what your goals and objectives are for therapy, so maybe think on that before you show up.  The next couple sessions they'll dial back exactly how much they ask/start the questions/etc.  Once you seems comfortable you'll probably be starting the session yourself.   I usually open with if I'm feeling better or whatever we ended on previous week.  If I'm at a lost for how to start I ask her to start for me.  Ideally, the sessions will turn into you sort of unraveling things, with a little guided help.  I cried completely through the first two sessions, it is totally ok and totally normally.   I'm really bad at starting and usually ask for help, because I get anxious before I go in (been going for six months).  My therapist is awesome, down to earth, and empathetic.

If it affects your job, then they have a lawsuit on their hands.  I wouldn't worry about it.  I told my boss, and everyone I'm bipolar, but my boss is an open drunk (32, work in a restaurant) so now he thinks it's appropriate to call me manic when I am just frustrated, and tells other people they are being manic (??!), can't wait to have an HR department to fire his drunk ass.

Being worried you are not bad enough or dont deserve therapy is 100% depression talking. Most people who are depressed think this. It was hard for me to learn, and still when I get so low and my depression is kicked in full force, I suddenly think I dont deserve therapy, because there must be people out there worse than me. 

When my depressive episode comes (bipolar) I can do literally nothing except my extreme obligations (work, therapy). Nothing else. So its similar to what youre saying. You deserve therapy. Your feelings are valid."

More than likely youll just schedule your appointment at the end of each session, and an email reminder gets sent to you. Do you have a cell phone?  They dont have to call your parents since your the client. 

Also, when your dad takes you to the doctor, he doesnt have to go back with you, correct?  If he fills out the forms for you, they take it back, ask you if youre still on your pain meds and then just tell to add your psych meds to the sheet. 

Your mom absolutely does not have to be in the room. And my first THERAPY appointment was an hour, like all my sessions. However, when I went to the psychiatrist to get a formal diagnosis and meds, the initial appointment was prob 90 mins.

Rather than a chemical imbalance, certain parts of your brain are actually shut off during hypomania/depression, they're like literal dead zones.

bipolar,fdl1kkx,t3_ely81t,1578515450.0,"Mood journal. 
Record positive and negative little points from your day, keep track of when you dont sleep/dont sleep well, and when you use alcohol or other substances. Record your mood AM and PM.  If you end up having to use anything for anxiety during the day, note it. Also make a note you felt more anxious than usual. It takes about five mins a day and is so worth it! 

I use a scale of -3 through +3.  Zero is my level mood (which is chronically a little sad), +1 is a little anxious (or hypo) +3 is the highest. Likewise for the negatives. -3 is extremely depressed, -2 is moderately. 

If I dont catch my hypomanic episodes myself (which I usually do now), I look back and circle my red flags, which for me are: drinking more and being excited by it, not being able to listen to music, crawly feeling on my skin, less sleep.

Oh, and I wrote this little weird things down too and I take more seroquel and follow up the next night in my journal to record if they are continuing or not."

I didn't know I was bipolar at the time but I knew something was very wrong because I couldn't stop saying ""this isn't me, this isnt how I react normally"".  It took me a few years before I saw someone about it.  

As to why it's uncontrollable: rather than being a chemical imbalance (like unipolar depression), bipolar is where different parts of your brain shut down at different times.  Like, the impulse control/rage center is literally TURNED OFF, if you look at a brain scan it is a black zone.  Controlling is out of the question.  It's wild.  If you'd like to get a better grasp on it there's an awesome book that breaks it down really well and very quickly (and in a very normal easy to understand way) called The Bipolar Survival Guide: what you and your family need to knowby Dr Miklowitz.  It's one of the very first chapters.

Her questions seemed to taper almost immediately, she was honing in on difference aspects of my personality, she was digging deep in a very quick (succinct would be more appropriate, it wasn't rushed) manner,  sometimes she'd hit a root and go in a different direction.  She definitely knew what she was doing.  She was also younger so I think that helps, believe it or not.  They are less jaded probably.  Anway, thought I was just depressed, turns out I'm bipolar.  Thought she was out of her mind until she explained herself.  And then I felt that giant wave of relief wash over me and I cried from happiness.  She also asked me if I accepted/agreed with the diagnoses. 

 They are professionals, they know what to ask and how to get to what they should be getting to.  Sometimes  they are wrong though, yes.   Also keep in mind that if you are doing all this research etc and youre going in there with your specific mindset, you will be less likely to accept a different diagnosis than the one you are assuming, or answer questions properly/100% honestly. ALSO, not being able to be completely open and honest 100% is detrimental.  That's the most important part, it is unfortunate your mom had to be present.

As to my experience, Im still trying to find the right dose (I am still chronically depressed and my psych wants to see if we can get the lamictal to help instead of introducing an antidepressant. Plus Im on birth control so it lowers the levels).  

I got a little hypomanic a month and a half ago, but it did not last anywhere near as long as before meds (2.5 weeks as opposed to 2.5 months). Same thing with my depressive episode. However, I went just as low as I did before being medicated, just a shorter period. I slowly crawled out of it. 

My original side effects were flu like pains, weird vision, and teeth grinding, always went away within a couple weeks. As I got to a higher dose there were tremors and teeth grinding, took a little longer to go away. Now at 300mg and I feel like I have Alzheimers, cant wait to ideally go back down and maybe just add an antidepressant.

I also felt the same way about my mental health.  Then I just kept finding myself saying things like, ""I'm so so sorry.  I don't understand why I reacted that way"", and ""I haven't had any control over my emotions, I don't feel like myself, I swear I'm not usually like this"".  CONSTANTLY, I was acting like a hormonal 15 year old. 

7 months ago I was diagnosed at 32.  When I told people I was bipolar everyone was very supportive.  And when I told people closer to me, who knew I was going through something and had been trying to figure it out, they were even more supportive.  I don't think anyone thought I was attention seeking at all (although sometimes I feel like when I talk openly about it that is how people perceive it).   My mother, of course said ""well, didn't you already know that about yourself?"" (because I'm often short with her-- because we clash), so then I had to send her an article about what bipolar actually is.  

I didn't belive the psychiatrist at first, and I laughed at her for a few short seconds, then I just started crying. ..

Anyway, I tell this to everyone, but definitely read ""The Bipolar Survival Guide"" by Dr. Miklowitz.  That book gave me more information and more insight than the psychiatrist has given (she's great though)  over the past 7 months, and more than what I've learned from my therapist (also great).  There is SO much information in there, from what bipolar actually is and what it does in the brain, to how it manifests itself physically and mentally on a spectrum in different ways for different people, to coping skills and mechanisms and how to keep yourself in check.  Very, very useful.  It's a thick book but some chapters are probably skippable (like the one about raising a child with bipolar).  Sorry this is so long!

That being said, when I am depressed after a manic episode I do not believe there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  All I can think is that for the rest of my life I will have really fun manic episodes, and eventually one day I will (always no matter what) into a depressive episode right after and literally not be able to move.  So, that is what gets me there.  

I still try to do my coping exercises, but I believe they are pointless and I can't wait to leave my house and hopefully die.  The only thing I am actually capable of is going to work and therapy. 

My therapist told me to view depression as like the flu, or a chronic pain, it comes and it's hard, but you have things that you can do to ease it, so these are mine:  

A tiny 3 step list to start my day with, five minutes each task max, try to make it consistent and daily.  My list is stretch, make bed/update mood journal/bring my dog outside.  Literally just bring him outside (live i a city), notice it doesn't feel awful and I can do it, take him on a brief walk down the street, and if I can't do more, I can't do more, but if I feel okay, take him around the block.

I've heard that filling the sink with ice water and sticking your face in it helps when you can't stop crying, I can't wait to do that.

I have to talk back to my thoughts, like ""this will pass, it will pass it will pass"", ""just eat literally a bite of anything and it will help, just eat something"" (usually can't keep stuff down), ""just get out of the shower"", etc.  

None of this actually helps me feel or get better, I unfortunately just have to wait for my episode to pass, lasts as long as how long my manic episode lasts.  Hope at least some of this was informative."

I'm at 300 now, and the only side effects I got this time are no libido and constant teeth grinding, but no tremors.

How long have you been on them and what dose?  Did you titrate up slowly?  I'm pretty sure if you go up too fast you get pretty bad side effects that don't really (??) go away, or are just bad for a while.

I had a very long explanation of how my mood journal helps and how I use it, but I scratched that.   
 For the most part I know I will be turning a corner into extreme depression eventually when I'd rather be inside than outside, can't find the point in socializing, can't read, everything bores me, and I'm writing things like ""I HATE EVERYONE"" in my mood journal.   And so, as the other person says, I have an attack plan.  It has to start with me forcing myself to eat, and then everything else falls into place.  I SWEAR TO GOD THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.  I knew it was important, and my psychiatrist will check on me to see if I'm eating when I'm bad, and my reaction was always 'uhhhhhhhhhhh, this can't save me"".  So eat, forced socialization, dragging myself to the boxing gym, getting to bed before a certain time no matter what (tricky one cause I work in a bar/restaurant). For the most part, these are things mentioned anywhere and everywhere, but it's just the solid truth.  I also get ahead of myself in case it doesn't work and I plummet:  I make sure to tidy up my house before I leave every day so it's actually nice to come home to, and I do a task here and there like mop or dust on top of tidying up, a load of laundry, scrub the tub.  Something, anything.  I have a small list of three 5 min tasks every morning to to keep me going: stretch, mood journal, make bed.  Having three tiny tasks to complete will help boost your motivation.  ""Motivation Follows Action""

This worked well for me the last time as I was dragging myself out of a horrible depressive episode, so I'm sure it would work the other way around.  I also found that limiting my screen time (which I already sort of do) more strictly was awesome as well."

My therapist and psychiatrist have been helpful, but this book has just given me so much info, from understanding exactly what bipolar is and how it effects different parts of the brain at different times, to coping mechanisms, and throughout the whole book they have examples and quotes of real people, which helps understand the spectrum of bipolar, and how episodes in people differently, and how they cope."

depression,fe3g2kr,t3_enosxw,1578848961.0,"So, your first session they will ask you questions and talk a little more, and they'll take some notes; they usually only take notes the first session or two.  Your first session they will also ask you what your goals and objectives are for therapy, so maybe think on that before you show up.  The next couple sessions they'll dial back exactly how much they ask/start the questions/etc.  Once you seems comfortable you'll probably be starting the session yourself.   I usually open with if I'm feeling better or whatever we ended on previous week.  If I'm at a lost for how to start I ask her to start for me.  Ideally, the sessions will turn into you sort of unraveling things, with a little guided help.  I cried completely through the first two sessions, it is totally ok and totally normally.   I'm really bad at starting and usually ask for help, because I get anxious before I go in (been going for six months).  My therapist is awesome, down to earth, and empathetic.

If it affects your job, then they have a lawsuit on their hands.  I wouldn't worry about it.  I told my boss, and everyone I'm bipolar, but my boss is an open drunk (32, work in a restaurant) so now he thinks it's appropriate to call me manic when I am just frustrated, and tells other people they are being manic (??!), can't wait to have an HR department to fire his drunk ass.

Being worried you are not “bad enough” or don’t “deserve” therapy is 100% depression talking. Most people who are depressed think this.

More than likely you’ll just schedule your appointment at the end of each session, and an email reminder gets sent to you. Do you have a cell phone?  They don’t have to call your parents since your the client. 

Also, when your dad takes you to the doctor, he doesn’t have to go back with you, correct?  If he fills out the forms for you, they take it back, ask you if you’re still on your pain meds and then just tell to add your psych meds to the sheet. 

Your mom absolutely does not have to be in the room. And my first THERAPY appointment was an hour, like all my sessions. However, when I went to the psychiatrist to get a formal diagnosis and meds, the initial appointment was prob 90 mins.

Record positive and negative little points from your day, keep track of when you don’t sleep/don’t sleep well, and when you use alcohol or other substances. Record your mood AM and PM.  If you end up having to use anything for anxiety during the day, note it. Also make a note you felt more anxious than usual. It takes about five mins a day and is so worth it! 

I use a scale of -3 through +3.  Zero is my level mood (which is chronically a little sad), +1 is a little anxious (or hypo) +3 is the highest. Likewise for the negatives. -3 is extremely depressed, -2 is moderately. 

If I don’t catch my hypomanic episodes myself (which I usually do now), I look back and circle my red flags, which for me are: drinking more and being excited by it, not being able to listen to music, crawly feeling on my skin, less sleep.

Oh, and I wrote this little weird things down too and I take more seroquel and follow up the next night in my journal to record if they are continuing or not."

It took me a few years before I saw someone about it.  

As to why it's uncontrollable: rather than being a chemical imbalance (like unipolar depression), bipolar is where different parts of your brain shut down at different times.  Like, the impulse control/rage center is literally TURNED OFF, if you look at a brain scan it is a black zone.  Controlling is out of the question.  It's wild.  If you'd like to get a better grasp on it there's an awesome book that breaks it down really well and very quickly (and in a very normal easy to understand way) called The Bipolar Survival Guide: what you and your family need to knowby Dr Miklowitz.  It's one of the very first chapters.

She definitely knew what she was doing.  She was also younger so I think that helps, believe it or not.  They are less jaded probably.  Anway, thought I was just depressed, turns out I'm bipolar.  Thought she was out of her mind until she explained herself.  And then I felt that giant wave of relief wash over me and I cried from happiness.  She also asked me if I accepted/agreed with the diagnoses. 

 They are professionals, they know what to ask and how to get to what they should be getting to.  Sometimes  they are wrong though, yes.   Also keep in mind that if you are doing all this research etc and youre going in there with your specific mindset, you will be less likely to accept a different diagnosis than the one you are assuming, or answer questions properly/100% honestly. ALSO, not being able to be completely open and honest 100% is detrimental.  That's the most important part, it is unfortunate your mom had to be present.  

I hope it works out for you!  Would love to know what happens and if you end up getting the diagnosis you expected.  You are always welcome to create a dialogue with them, though, and discuss it further if you disagree.

I got a little hypomanic a month and a half ago, but it did not last anywhere near as long as before meds (2.5 weeks as opposed to 2.5 months). Same thing with my depressive episode. However, I went just as low as I did before being medicated, just a shorter period. I slowly crawled out of it. 

My original side effects were flu like pains, weird vision, and teeth grinding, always went away within a couple weeks. As I got to a higher dose there were tremors and teeth grinding, took a little longer to go away.

CONSTANTLY, I was acting like a hormonal 15 year old. 

7 months ago I was diagnosed at 32.  When I told people I was bipolar everyone was very supportive.  And when I told people closer to me, who knew I was going through something and had been trying to figure it out, they were even more supportive.  I don't think anyone thought I was attention seeking at all (although sometimes I feel like when I talk openly about it that is how people perceive it).   My mother, of course said ""well, didn't you already know that about yourself?"" (because I'm often short with her-- because we clash), so then I had to send her an article about what bipolar actually is.  

I didn't belive the psychiatrist at first, and I laughed at her for a few short seconds, then I just started crying. ..

Anyway, I tell this to everyone, but definitely read ""The Bipolar Survival Guide"" by Dr. Miklowitz.  That book gave me more information and more insight than the psychiatrist has given (she's great though)  over the past 7 months, and more than what I've learned from my therapist (also great).  There is SO much information in there, from what bipolar actually is and what it does in the brain, to how it manifests itself physically and mentally on a spectrum in different ways for different people, to coping skills and mechanisms and how to keep yourself in check.

That being said, when I am depressed after a manic episode I do not believe there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  All I can think is that for the rest of my life I will have really fun manic episodes, and eventually one day I will (always no matter what) into a depressive episode right after and literally not be able to move.  So, that is what gets me there.  

I still try to do my coping exercises, but I believe they are pointless and I can't wait to leave my house and hopefully die.  The only thing I am actually capable of is going to work and therapy. 

My therapist told me to view depression as like the flu, or a chronic pain, it comes and it's hard, but you have things that you can do to ease it, so these are mine:  

A tiny 3 step list to start my day with, five minutes each task max, try to make it consistent and daily.  My list is stretch, make bed/update mood journal/bring my dog outside.  Literally just bring him outside (live i a city), notice it doesn't feel awful and I can do it, take him on a brief walk down the street, and if I can't do more, I can't do more, but if I feel okay, take him around the block.

I've heard that filling the sink with ice water and sticking your face in it helps when you can't stop crying, I can't wait to do that.

I have to talk back to my thoughts, like ""this will pass, it will pass it will pass"", ""just eat literally a bite of anything and it will help, just eat something"" (usually can't keep stuff down), ""just get out of the shower"", etc.  

None of this actually helps me feel or get better, I unfortunately just have to wait for my episode to pass, lasts as long as how long my manic episode lasts.  Hope at least some of this was informative."

Maybe I'll try it out around 200 and see what happens.  I would love to just sleep...it's really getting haywire which is just no good.  Thanks for the info."
depression,fcyvhka,t3_ejlykf,1578087971.0,"It’s better to let it go or let them process.  They may come back eventually. Blocking or deleting people can seem spiteful or immature in some scenarios.  It probably just means that they don’t hate you and still respect you.  I don’t talk to people who have said hurtful or uncalled for things to me in the past, but we still follow each other on IG and will occasionally like a post.  Especially if it’s something about self improvement or growth."
BipolarReddit,fcyfjje,t3_ejhnfx,1578079337.0,"I'm 32, and I will never go off my meds.  If I do, I will go higher and I will go lower.   I already can barely hang through my depressive episodes.  The episodes will also be longer than what you are experiencing.  Just think of how bad you felt before being diagnosed,  you will go back to that."
bipolar2,fcyehxy,t1_fcyea70,1578078933.0,"Also, I have realized that if I don't drink I don't have less fun.  My friends are still enjoyable, and I just crush club sodas the entire time, like CRUSH.  I especially no longer drink if I'm with more than 2 people, because I'm just too enabled.  I would much rather wake up feeling ok than feeling anxious and depressed.  It was a very hard lesson to learn/figure out, and quite a process, but it's the best feeling.  Oh, and now that I'm medicated I 100% black out after 2-3 drinks, sooooo..."
bipolar2,fcyea70,t3_ejeqaq,1578078821.0,"Abbbbbbbsolutely.   I used to be a heavy drinker, but now even if I have 2 drinks I have mega anxiety and depression following day, sometimes two.  If I go heavy, forget it, full blow depressed episode.  Lasts quite a while.  So much worse than a physical hangover!!!!!!!!"
bipolar,fcy9jf5,t3_eji6yl,1578076678.0,"11?!?  I wake up at 8 and if I take mine at 11 it doesn’t happen.  I take 50-75 mg.  I work a little late so sometimes I have to take it at work (10 is the latest I’ll take it unless I don’t have to be up in the AM).  I really haven’t been getting up at 8 anymore because it’s almost impossible with the seroquel.  Do you find you have nightmares on seroquel?  When I try to fight the seroquel, I get a little paranoid and am scared to go to bed, worried someone will break in.  Then I have nightmares.

Also very recently I’ve been putting my alarm (phone) either on the other side of the room, but ideally in the living room. The cold trek helps a lot."
bipolar,fcy8r02,t3_ejiau9,1578076434.0,"I like the mental illness happy hour podcast.  It doesn’t center around bipolar specifically, although there are definitely some episodes.  The host is awesome and really sympathetic, and also brings a little humor to the podcast, which is needed.  He interviews famous people or semi famous people dealing with their mental health.  It’s really great.  Also Dax Shepard has a podcast and you can scroll through the descriptions and find the ones dealing with bipolar/mental health. It’s called Armchair Expert, and he also interviews famous people."
suggestmeabook,fcy8f4c,t3_ejict9,1578076258.0,"I have another suggestion. Using a kindle is awesome because you can click on any word and it will immediately define it for you, so that’s pretty useful for vocab. 
I prefer a physical book, though."
bipolar2,fcy84ui,t1_fcy6ikq,1578076142.0,"I am on just lamictal (but have seroquel to sleep and for anxiety as needed).  Lamictal helps with my chronic low level anxiety a significant amount, but I do get the occasional panic/anxiety attack, and they are BAD, but few and far between.  But also I was never previously diagnosed with GAD or anything, just bipolar2. 

I am dying for my psychiatrist to give me an antidepressant, but she’s apprehensive of course, as we are still trying to find the right lamictal dose. She thought after I cycled and went very, very low, that we should increase lamictal to 300mg.  I’m super foggy and groggy and my libido just disappeared."
mentalillness,fcv5qcs,t3_ej2qxd,1577995198.0,"Sounds a lot like bipolar.  Do you get sad/depressed when these interests end- not cause theyre over but just in general?  When I first noticed it in myself (but didn't know what it was) I felt like my brain was on fire because I had so much mental nervous energy I had to be doing things at ALL times.  Instead of boxing a few days a week, I took 2-3 classes a day, I did a bunch of weird creepy mathwork to figure out my MACROS, and then I had a hard time eating.  Obsessively cleaning, felt so productive and accomplished at all times.  Then one day I woke up and couldn't move.  Didn't box for a month, couldn't walk my dog.  etc."
mentalhealth,fcv5l9r,t3_ej2whk,1577995114.0,"I don't know if that is dissociation or not, because I have no idea about that- but it sounds like the beginning of my panic attacks."
