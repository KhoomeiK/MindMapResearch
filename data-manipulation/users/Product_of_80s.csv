AskUK,ff2j93v,t1_ff1vffz,1579508616.0,I have given thought into coding but I am dealing with some other stuff possibly undiagnosed adhd which is making it hard to concentrate on the information and the actual doing of it. I started building a website and just left it and can’t bring myself to go back to it. Once you get into the higher levels of coding then comes the complex maths which I am shit at. So I am at a loss with what to do I can’t really go for apprenticeships as I don’t have any GCSEs in maths only have English.

In order to utilise your existing skill set effectively you could brush up on your programming skills through Kahn academy and other online resources, you are at the beginning of a exciting adventure my friend lots to be discovered out there don’t give up!!

P.S Something else worth mentioning is that you could revamp the business and bring it up to current speed with things if you know how to tweak the product to a current market you could also start a business doing remote CS work also."
