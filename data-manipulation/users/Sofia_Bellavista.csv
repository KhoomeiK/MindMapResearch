MurderedByWords,ffeovpp,t1_ffaeok5,1579857999.0,"Since the temperature is *rising* it’s *changing*, the definitions are interchangeable because they describe the same (complex) phenomenon in different terms and slightly different angles. English is not my first language but I have never heard the two terms being used simultaneously because it would be redundant since they refer to the same issue. In fact science communicators are recommending to use “climate change” rather than “global warming” because deniers use the the argument “winters are getting colder therefore the globe isn’t warming up”."
