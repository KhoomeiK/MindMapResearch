All the people on here saying “im a former “bomber” (sure..)” and no one mentioned that this was probably a commisioned piece or at least done on a legal wall. Fucking dudes dont hang their ass out in the breeze for days on end illegally painting those big ass, fine looking murals you see on walls. This wasnt H&M taking a picture in front of some shitbird’s “tag.”
