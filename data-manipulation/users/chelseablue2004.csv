OutOfTheLoop,fekklaz,t3_epm3j1,1579201998.0,"Answer: Bernie was accused of being misogynistic by a [CNN Article written my MJ Lee , saying that ""A Woman can't be elected president""](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/13/politics/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-meeting/index.html). The Article was based on a leak from the someone in the Warren Campaign...

CNN then goes on in the debates to ask if he said such things, he denied ever saying them. The next question was to Warren, and a standard journalist would say ""Did he say such things?"" but instead the moderator asks, ""How do you feel when he said those things?"" basically trying to confirm thru Elizabeth Warren he said those things without asking her.

The problem with all of it is that there are videos that Bernie has been pushing for Women candidates in politics even for president [Watch here](https://twitter.com/meaganmday/status/1216793548567113728) and [Watch here](https://twitter.com/_ericblanc/status/1216840316109475841) ... Making these comments completely out of left field and seemingly an attack on Bernie's character. He was also even the one in 2015 who wanted Elizabeth Warren to run against Clinton for the Democratic nomination before he went himself. So it looks like a desperate attempt to push Bernie out by CNN and even by the Warren camp. The funny thing in all of it is, and that people are realizing is that if you try to attack Bernie in a character debate he has videos, audio and history complete against what you are attacking him with.

Disney for example, I think are forcing theaters to run Rise of Skywalker in their main theaters for 6-8 weeks mandatory if they want Disney movies in their theaters for 2020.
