SoccerBetting,fef4kjx,t3_eou391,1579048027.0,"The worst thing is when you call in the operators take so long to read out your bets to confirm, even though you’re providing them with a bet code which specified what the bet is. Really sucks when you’re doing a live multi with teams that no one can pronounce."
news,feebk2m,t3_eond7n,1579030377.0,More like they've been hiding technology which could have been used to save countless lives and improve mankind as a whole for decades now. I bet they have something which could for example easily help stop the bushfires in Australia right now. Do you really think they would really release these sort of files knowing the backlash they could face from the public at large.

worldnews,fdgh4eg,t3_el9e6g,1578396544.0,You haven’t seen shit. Stop making up stories to justify your point. It’s quite simple mate. Idiots gathered to mourn someone whose directly responsible for the death of thousands and those idiots killed their own innocents. It’s wasn’t anyone’s fault except their own.
worldnews,fdggrit,t1_fdggjr3,1578396091.0,No you’re a fucking moron. There were millions in HK and millions in South America gathering and protesting recently and they managed not stampede each other to death quite well. You can’t change the nature of the irrational and uncivilised unfortunately.
worldnews,fdgg8hy,t1_fdgg2nr,1578395403.0,I can comment whatever the fuck I want you little bitch. Why you mad though? Haha
worldnews,fdgfrik,t1_fdgfmn1,1578394767.0,I’m not American and not into American politics. I’m a neutral observer and when bunch of idiots gather to mourn someone and end up killing their own people then it’s their own fault and not Trumps.
worldnews,fdgfhn7,t1_fdgf8dm,1578394393.0,Yeah I mean just goes to show the kind of idiots that dwell in such countries. You have protests and mass gatherings happening in HK and elsewhere but none of them are dumb enough to stampede and kill their own lol.
worldnews,fdgffhw,t1_fdgf02e,1578394311.0,This is like saying if people weren't born then they wouldn't die.

sydney,fb6ffth,t3_eblmdt,1576548951.0,I hate to break it to you dude but your whole life has been a lie and so that the expectations that you've put on yourself and those put upon you by your parents.
