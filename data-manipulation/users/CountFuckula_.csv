mac,feqyyck,t3_eq8grq,1579347688.0,"This is a great idea and i'm definitely going to be following your lead here. Since It seems my questions have been asked and answered, I'll ask a basic one instead. Approximately how long did it take you to install?"
mac,feqyjuk,t1_fepgews,1579347521.0,I have a 2013 mbp with a 1tb ssd and my battery life is virtually the same as when I had a 720 hdd in there.

confessions,feobo34,t1_fenjy1r,1579297789.0,"I agree the call needed to be made. When I was a kid I knew a bunch of people who went through mild to serious abuse from parents, several of which I took into my own home (we had the space and means at the time) to help them stay safe and get their lives more in order. I only wish that as an adult, i could do that now for kids like this."
TrueOffMyChest,fenrowk,t3_epzvdl,1579289774.0,"I'll say this, as much as I understand and agree in some situations, think of this:

Where I live its illegal to ride my bike on the sidewalk. If I am sitting, stationary even, on my bike on the sidewalk I can get a ticket. The road I live on and many others leading to business have no sidewalk, some have no shoulder. Personally if it's at night I use a small light so I am visible but understand in some situations it may not be the pedestrian being an asshole."
techsupport,fein3r6,t1_feimxuq,1579142398.0,"Also, saw your mention if being paranoid even with manyfacturers,etc.. windows telemetry logs everything you do every so many minutes, so honestly if you're worried about privacy get yourself into a Linux distro"
techsupport,feimxuq,t3_ep58ey,1579142287.0,Good advice in some of these. For sure wipe and do a fresh install. I also suggest changing your Microsoft account pw. If you tried to log in (successfully or not) you're safer changing it when you've got everything properly set up and secured rather than risk having given it up if there is a logger installed.
pens,feikdsk,t3_epavvy,1579140564.0,Ahhhhh I need this. I can't decide if I like the colour or design better
AMA,fei8xr0,t3_ep6lx4,1579132923.0,This is an awesome ama! Most of my questions seem to have been asked and answered so just wanna say I've thoroughly enjoyed the read and am interested in how things so progress. Will be looking into your kickstarter. This sounds absolutely like something I not only really want as a product but something I'm fascinated in the production of as well.

memes,fdtjgoj,t3_emy0oj,1578717639.0,I once read an article that stated if you frequently have farts that scratch your itchy butthole that you probably have worms. Buttworms. I'll just let you all think about that.
