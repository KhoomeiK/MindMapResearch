No one would confuse that with even the slightly underweight but still attractive teenage model types that they claim are “totally anorexic” and makes the claims of their “severe anorexia while technically overweight BMI-wise” seem outright ludicrous. No one would have found this extremely ill woman the definition of beauty in any situation."

I did not get the same quality of workout from these people, and they did not inspire me to push myself. Frankly there’s a reason why a trainer’s body is their business card- I’m not trying to exercise and spend money on something that is making the person who does it for a living look worse than I do. Duh."

fatlogic,fcxguxy,t1_fcw5lrl,1578062592.0,"This is my biggest issue with the FA movement- implying that physical health is less important than self esteem issues, and stating health facts is an attempt to shame someone and make them feel bad. It just strikes me as so patently absurd and that’s what is so disturbing about how widespread it is. Like certainly self esteem is a part of your mental health, but I don’t think anyone can really compare the side effects of knowing your behavior is causing your body damage to the actual damage occurring, right? Also it shows how almost all these people must be either food addicts or using food as an unhealthy coping mechanism that they will cling to over anything else. If you literally harbor this delusional of thinking, you need to have psychiatric help in my opinion. Getting weighed should not be a life or death emotional experience, and eating healthy portions and exercising now and then should not be some unbearable onus to someone. I just can’t help but imagine the emotional turmoil can’t actually be real at a certain point. Like when I was a teen I might have thought that being thought of as fat was some life or death situation, but I certainly imagine by the time most people are 25, they stop thinking their entire worth is tied up in their physical appearance and start broadening their view of how they fit into reality and accept that, you know, most people aren’t insanely attractive or freakishly ugly, most people are pretty middle of the road, and maybe focusing so much on how other people perceive you is not going to be a great long term strategy as you age if you are going to lose your shit if anyone implies you aren’t insanely beautiful. Also the obvious of- obviously they have to know they are fat. I am thin and I can tell immediately if I gain five pounds. The idea that so many people can be so far into denial astounds me honestly."

Like if you’re addicted to heroin, yeah just telling someone to quit without discussing the reasons for addiction isn’t going to be the solution, but I think if you are in the ER after overdosing multiple times and the doctor tells you you need to seek out treatment or you’ll die, that is the least they can do as a medical professional. The fact is that FAs don’t want to give up their addictions. They want to be enabled and told its fine to overeat as a coping mechanism. If they are that emotionally attached to food, then yeah I do think therapy is a good idea for them, but for some reason I don’t think they want to hear an addiction narrative around their behavior, they just want someone to tell them that their addiction is actually normal and it’s everyone else/“society” that’s the real problem."
fatlogic,fcsb3ej,t1_fcqgxxe,1577914055.0,"I hate this because the FAs usually center a conversation around some made up health facts that are simply not true and a bunch of weird ideas that have no basis in evidence. Yet the moment you say “hey there’s no evidence that supports that and you are spreading misinformation”, suddenly you’re “moralizing” them, “fat shaming” them, and need to mind your own business and not comment on other people’s bodies. It’s just absurd because stating basic facts in a nonjudgmental way is perceived of as an “attack” to them when they are the ones who are centering the conversation on health, then twisting it into a politeness or self esteem angle when no one brought that up. Like I don’t think I’m morally superior to someone because I’m thin. I do think I’m morally superior to people who spread bunk science around in order to enable their addiction and encouraging others to accept hopelessness instead. To me, that is morally repugnant. If all they care about is self esteem stuff, fine, whatever- then talk about the self esteem aspects and leave the made up fake medical advice out of it."
fatlogic,fbm9ibv,t1_fblogpf,1576980497.0,"I agree with you so much. I have so many friends like this who seem to love how neatly they can fit themselves into some stereotype- every statement is prefaced by “as a bisexual queer person,” etc and it’s just like...how about you as a person with an opinion? When I think about what defines me as a person, I think how I feel and things I like are because of my uniqueness, not as a way to fit into some neat definition that makes me identical to others with the same identity as me. That way of thinking makes no sense to me. I don’t think becoming a cliché is something to be proud of, so this whole phenomenon is bizarre to me."
