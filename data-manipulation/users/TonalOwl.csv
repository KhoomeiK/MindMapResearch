Since then it's grown out from fringes using a few different tendrils, marketing itself as educated,  and playing upon the American fear of not being ""normal"" or having ""freak"" children. On the extreme religious side its ""playing god"" or ""made out of fetus juice"" its also on that extreme end of the hip trendy ""doterra mommy uses only natural things because nature isnt dangerous  and essential oils cure life"" train as well.

 They scoot under mandatory vaccs for school using our constitutional right to freedom of religion, by of course claiming its under some extreme religion or another.

Its not legally abuse. Like it or not, its well within the parent's rights to teach their kids whatever they want. You cant define it as abuse unless it provides a real threat to the child's ongoing health and development.  Which does not really include having them parade around with you.
