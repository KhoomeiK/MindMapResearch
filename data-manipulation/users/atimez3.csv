The guy on the corner dancing around for several hours with the Liberty Tax Service sign has a hell of a lot more discipline than most people I can think of."
politics,ffcqjmk,t1_ffcpxd4,1579805145.0,No they didn't arrest her. I was just trying to illustrate how seriously the proceedings are taken.
politics,ffclvr2,t1_ffcfaj3,1579802225.0,"I live in IL and sat on a jury.  The second day of the trial, one of the jurors got a flat tire on her way to the courthouse.  When she didn't check in at the required time, the judge immediately sent sheriff's deputies after her."
politics,ffafy8g,t1_ff9smz2,1579734836.0,"Hanging chads. An unclear ballot in a county dominated by elderly voters that had them voting for Pat Buchanan while thinking that they were voting for Gore. Thousands absentee and early voting ballots thrown out for ""reasons"".  More thousands of ballots left uncounted and undiscovered until after the SC's decision.  A Governor who happened to be the brother of one of the candidates, both of whom belong to what can now be accurately termed a political dynasty.  An ambitious Secretary of State overseeing the election who had been promised (and received) help with her political career.  And not least of all, a lackluster candidate who failed to inspire the electorate, chose an unpopular running mate, and distanced himself from a charismatic and (despite his impeachment) still very popular outgoing president. 

Yes I believe that the world would be a better place if Gore had won in 2000. But I lived in FL during that election and pretty much ate, breathed and slept politics. Ralph Nader wasn't the cause of Bush being appointed President.  

Currently I live in the Midwest although admittedly not in one of the swing states. Still spend way too much time studying armchair politics. In 2016 I was having to travel to a lot of tiny (think less than 1500 pop) towns in NE and CO.  Spoke with a lot of people. They hated Hillary but were willing to listen to Bernie.  Once they got past the whole socialism thing, a lot of them liked what he had to say.  Would they have voted for him over Trump, I honestly don't know.  But I do know that none of them were ever going to vote for Hillary. 

I don't believe that the DNC stole the nomination from Bernie. But this narrative that her loss was anyone else's fault but her and the Democratic establishments needs to die already."

I will urge my daughter to try and get out. But I will have my own methods of death available because fuck dying in a camp at the hands of a former neighbor who is ""just following orders""."
television,fem384e,t1_feljv85,1579238272.0,So nice to know I'm not alone in feeling this way. I just can't quit them (sobs in Grimes).
ABoringDystopia,fej8e27,t3_epatea,1579161308.0,I'm so sorry that your mom was treated this way.
politics,feg4anv,t1_feg1ezh,1579076270.0,"I would also point out that millions of people have died throughout the years so that the pragmatists can have their incremental change.  It's just that now it's not just brown people and poor people. The $50,000 - $120,000 class is starting to die on the alter of managed care as well. Now it's a problem."
politics,feg37gr,t1_fefwitm,1579074922.0,Andrew Yang is siphoning off a segment of Trump voters as well. I would trust him over Tulsi.
