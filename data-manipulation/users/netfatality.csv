funny,fgtsey1,t1_fgtci4k,1581108678.0,"I 100% agree with you - I should have been more robust in comment above or clear on my sarcasm. I don’t think psychoactive THC should be used when treating animals, unless (perhaps) under an extremely controlled setting, and provided the condition is serious enough and that THC has proven success in extensive clinical research. I was a bit snarky in my above comment, but I’m with you. Don’t get dogs high because you think “they like it” - they have no idea what’s going on, and do not possess the self-awareness to safely navigate the high. That’s very sad about the dog.. that person sounds ignorant as hell.. I hope he either never has possession of an animal again, or more-so hope he learned a truly hard lesson and has changed for the better."

GetMotivated,fg6wfxp,t3_ex6pf9,1580578462.0,"meant to reply to u/action_lawyer_comics - This hits hard. I have a friend who half-jokingly says this to me all the time, “you’ve changed.” And it bums me out because it’s really just him saying “I don’t want to change.” The guy takes a lot of ADD medication, unprescribed - says he needs it. Smokes a lot of weed which I can enable a bit.. does MDMA or LSD on the weekends.. Drinks a lot. Generally is just losing it. We’re in our early 30’s. I have a long ass way to go but I’m 54 days substance-free (alcohol/weed/hard stuff) and I feel this is a picture of us. We had plans to chill today but I’m pretty sure he went to bed at 6am. Sorry for the sob story."

cannabis,ffbhptq,t3_esbk1h,1579765813.0,"I am generally high energy and high stress/anxiety. There’s an 18:1 CBD:THC on the market in CA that worked like a charm, but I was ripping it every 45 minutes or so. Every night I was high THC dosages in either flower or edible form. That much THC consumption wasn’t good for me in the long run and I had a mental breakdown, more or less. Been off alcohol and cannabis now for 50 days, eating better and exercising a bit and the anxiety is much more manageable. For heavy anxiety, you generally want at least 8:1 ratio, CBD dominant. But lifestyle changes in tandem will give you best results."
