You've got <2 years of experience under your belt, it's not surprising that you're primarily doing drafting (and make no mistake, drafting is still technical design work).  You'll get more responsibility with time, and if it doesn't happen naturally, bring it to your supervisor's attention.

I stuck with the design/consulting world for 10 years before finally moving on to something else.  I wish I'd done it sooner, because the lack of professional fulfillment really did a number on my mental health for many of those years.

I'd suggest being patient and seeing if things turn around for you though (they didn't for me, but they might for you).  Bring your concerns about your early career development to your supervisor, hopefully they will take it seriously and assign you more design work.

civilengineering,ff9zxxy,t3_es1hhu,1579725083.0,"Here's a few notes...

* Your template is... interesting.  I don't dislike it, but it feels disorganized and a bit unprofessional (vague feedback, I know).  I'd recommend finding something cleaner and more professional looking.
* Objective: There's differing schools of thought on this, but for someone seeking an entry-level/internship position, I think it's fine to pad the resume a bit with a statement of your goals.  But if you're able to substantially fill one page completely without it, then lose it.
* Education: This should at least be below your Objective, maybe even below your Skills section.
* Skills: Lose the ""Working knowledge with:"" line, it's creating a lot of white space and is an unnecessary statement.
* Tie your work experience at Costco and the nursing home into your career goals.  Customer service experience is much more valuable than prepping meals and stocking shelves, so play up that aspect of it.
* Your Projects are good, but I'd recommend rolling them into either your education or work experience sections as appropriate.
* Hobbies/Interests: Lose this.  It's wasted space.
* You use the "">"" symbol in a couple of places where there should just be a hyphen.

Overall though, I'm surprised you're not getting much response.  I have to think it's because other candidates are just edging you out.  While your resume isn't knocking my socks off, I'd probably call you in for an interview unless I already had too many qualified candidates.

One thing that's also worth noting is that you may want to tweak your resume for each job you apply for in order to hit certain keywords from the job listing."

There might be times you're working 50+ hours and doing more than 10% traveling, and times where you're struggling to make 40 hours.

But, it sounds like you're already pretty jazzed about the opportunity at the small company and ready to move on from your current job.  Go for it, and good luck!"

If you're not willing to be her mother through this, then you've just been acting as a long-term babysitter these past 19 years.
