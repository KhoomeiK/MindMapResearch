therewasanattempt,fgmqixb,t1_fgmm7a4,1580930006.0,This is pretty hilarious. And now something I'm going to worry about my kids doing in the future.
AskReddit,fgmlo8u,t1_fgm6kox,1580927114.0,"Pepperspray and a gun. Spray and retreat, like a skunk. If they come after you after being spayed, that's time to shoot. I pray I'll never have to do either, but I carry both pepperspray and a gun."
Wellthatsucks,fgm9cre,t1_fglx8vl,1580920338.0,Did you roast him on an open fire?
aww,fglla9d,t1_fgl6u13,1580903073.0,"A couple of my girls had mites, or so I thought. They didn't display any other kind of illness, and (while it's been a few years since) I don't remember any of my research saying that they would display other signs, other than lethargy. Lethargy in a chicken is extremely noticable if you free range them. One that I thought had a bad case was actually broody, haha! 

Ugh, carrier battles are the worst. I'm glad he seems to be very trusting with you, though. He looks like a sweet boy. All of my cats are assholes. Unless my Spooky wants attention, but he's been demanding my husband's attention and not mine lately. Jerk."

raisedbynarcissists,fgk4w19,t1_fgk1pr8,1580857545.0,What state are you in? That's some bullshit.
LifeProTips,fgjnzpv,t1_fgj5md9,1580847958.0,r/niceguys can tell you that people expect something in return for simple compliments.
LifeProTips,fgjmyjk,t1_fgje73d,1580847356.0,"This is what I'll be doing for my kids. But, I'll have them choose multiple and put them on a cork board in their room, if they don't like how one looks anymore, it gets tossed. If there's one still there by the end of a year and they can save the money and find a good artist, I'll trade them to get it and be there to support them through the healing."
IdiotsInCars,fgjjxjk,t1_fgjfylc,1580845588.0,"No, this is why you shouldn't run red lights."
ChoosingBeggars,fgiu8z5,t1_fgim5tr,1580831037.0,"Yeah, if that story is true, I hope she dumped his ass. Hell, I'm petty enough that I'd mention it to his parents that he took that food and left her with nothing to eat."

aww,fgiohfb,t1_fghs5tu,1580827239.0,"Kids grow in weird sizes and hit ""in-between"" sizes very often, which leads to just wearing too big ones until they grow into them."
aww,fgio6ew,t1_fghsokx,1580827023.0,Have 2.5yo that's been walking since 10mo. Can confirm.
aww,fgintgu,t1_fghjel4,1580826766.0,"Number 2 is trying to stand on his own at 8mo. I'll be much happier when he's walking on his own, because I'm due with #3 and I don't want to carry his 27lb ass anymore."
aww,fgimsmh,t1_fgh7cun,1580826021.0,"How old is she, if you don't mind me asking? My 8mo is starting his standing and he's very determined to walk."
