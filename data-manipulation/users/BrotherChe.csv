Each year, thousands of anglers, hikers, and boaters enjoy Wyandotte County Lake, a manmade lake that has been a destination in northeast Kansas for nearly 75 years. Today, life on the lake is carefree, but building it was a different story. The process was so long and difficult that, at times, it looked like it would not happen at all.

Wyandotte County Lake Park was dreamed up in the early 1930s, when Wyandotte County, like much of the country, faced the dueling problems of economic depression and drought-induced scarcity of water. After finagling, political maneuvering, and some help by banker Willard Breidenthal, the Board of County Commissioners passed a resolution on September 24, 1935, to buy 1,400 acres of land near Marshall Creek to build a county lake and park, simultaneously solving the problems of lack of jobs and lack of water. The New Deal’s Works Progress Administration (WPA) provided labor.

In July 1936, the first of a number of strikes took place, as the WPA laborers demanded a raise. They also demanded that only Wyandotte County residents be hired, at least until the labor pool ran dry. Although it was resolved, it proved not to be the end of the strikes. Nothing, however, prepared the laborers for the disaster ahead.

On September 19, 1937, when the dam was 90 percent complete, and with water about 30 feet in the adjacent lake, several motorists sightseeing on a nearby road noticed a crack in the pavement. Wisely, they fled. The dam collapsed in a massive landslide.

300,000 pounds of earth fell 50 feet, causing the land to the north to shift and close a 16-foot drainage ditch. The collapse also made the highway over the spillway impassible.

WPA and Wyandotte County officials put the project on hold while they tried to figure out what to do. Rebuilding started nine months later at the end of July 1938 with the new dam just south of the dirt pile where the first dam once stood. It was completed in 1942.

Today, the Wyandotte County Lake enriches the lives of Kansas City residents. Jennifer Kilburg, education specialist at the Mr. and Mrs. F.L. Schlagle Library and Environmental Learning Center in Wyandotte County Lake Park, asserts,

In a county that is very urban, Wyandotte County Lake is a place to get away…The lake is continuously busy with fishermen and boating. We have over 11 miles of hiking and many people comment that it is the best trails in the area! Birders from all over eastern Kansas come out to the lake to see the migrating waterfowl. All of these activities would not be possible if this lake was not here."

From the Archives: The construction of the Wyandotte County Lake (Marshall Creek) Dam began as a WPA project in 1936. On September 19,1937, with the project 90% completed, the dam collapsed. After re-engineering the dam was rebuilt creating the Wyandotte County Lake we enjoy today.

WPA projects were usually federal and local partnerships. In this case local leaders including Willard Breidenthal proposed the project to the WPA. Several locations were considered for the lake with it's location choose for it's topography and Marshall Creek. In total the dam was estimated at $1,873,900. Work started with 500 men and peeked at 2,000 including local residents. The collapse was blamed on the soil with the steel pillars slipping, causing an earthquake in the county.

Looks like it was originally just fans who got together and developed it, then it was picked up as a free mod on  PC Gamer Mag disc, which drew the attention of Valve who then had them develop/modify it into Absolute Redemption that was released on retail copies of Counter-Strike. They then stuck together and formed a company, Maverick Developments, and did a bit more work for Valve and others.

https://www.valvetime.net/threads/community-interviews-tony-newton-co-creator-of-redemption.256856/

>> Redemption was originally released online as a mod for Half-Life and later re-released as a commercial add-on included with the retail version of Counter-Strike. How did this deal come about?

> We released Redemption as a mod after a mammoth 2 day session of working through the night, if I remember rightly, we had PC Gamer Magazine lined up to feature it on their cover disk - hence the deadline. I remember thinking ""if we could get this out to a couple of hundred people, that will be so cool"". I think we hit 100,000 downloads in the first week, and kept climbing. It was mind-blowing at the time. We were so stoked that our mod was being noticed. Then Valve rang us... They loved the humor in it, and the quality of it and offered to buy it, and have us work with them on some stuff if we were interested. We thought about it for about a second and said ""Sure""."
