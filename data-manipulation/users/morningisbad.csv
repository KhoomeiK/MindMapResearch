fightporn,ffaequx,t3_erlpdy,1579733960.0,When you min max your character and realize you can no longer do damage
fightporn,ffaekf9,t3_eq21xu,1579733817.0,I'm actually really happy that the dude was able to handle it himself. I was expecting a bully beating on him and some bigger dude coming to his rescue.
Whatcouldgowrong,ffad1yk,t1_ffa7dbb,1579732680.0,And now we are laugh you in the face
coolguides,ff48f0s,t1_ff3gkkh,1579557792.0,Seriously? Always $0.29/lb at the gas station here in Wisconsin
FREE,ff1xdlx,t3_er31c0,1579488347.0,It would be pretty awesome to win.
pussypassdenied,fejlh3j,t1_fejeoxd,1579178911.0,I don't think it's PPD no matter what. She's not trying to play the pussy pass. She's just being a bitch.
tifu,fehh9vz,t1_fehfpiv,1579116506.0,Yup! Not going to lie... I've been pulled into it a few times. I love me some trash TV though
tifu,fehfgol,t1_fehf1uo,1579115446.0,"Yeah, in certainly not an expert. My knowledge mostly comes from Netflix specials and shit my wife watches haha"
tifu,fehe6gd,t1_fehdahp,1579114701.0,Wasn't aware of the K3 to CR1. Very good point on the deportation not being from the US
tifu,feh4way,t1_fegvl09,1579109204.0,"Yes. You're correct. If the US citizen travels to the foreign country and gets married. Bringing that person back to the US would require a K3(?) visa. To your point, they're definitely not getting that either."
tifu,fegus74,t1_fegt16g,1579103001.0,You need a K1 if you're a non-US citizen trying to immigrate to the US and your immigration is based on getting married to them.
tifu,fegllvu,t1_feg8c6t,1579096544.0,"And definitely not going to happen at this point. The visa for this is a K1 visa, and those get rejected all over the place. Got in a bar fight 10 years ago? Probably going to get rejected. No chance you're getting a K1 after being deported for breaking immigration law."
politics,fegl15y,t1_fefwc0n,1579096062.0,Why would the DNC want this though? They've decided who they want to run (just like last time...) And they're going to do everything they can to ensure the public agrees with them. CNN is happy to step up and help skew the public opinion if it means more money in their pockets.
pics,fegjbno,t1_fegcjdf,1579094525.0,"Different people have different ways of dealing with things. Everything you said is 100% right for you. But if OP gets some comfort in sharing, he's 100% right too."
insanepeoplefacebook,fefab3e,t1_fef5xuw,1579051887.0,Oh man...I forgot about this. Simpler times.

AskMen,fedoni9,t1_fedo52y,1579016539.0,Nah man... The rest of the bits need to be in there to season the chips
facepalm,fedkonu,t1_fedkb9j,1579013921.0,Not in 2020. Stay woke fam.
facepalm,fedklzi,t1_fedj0bi,1579013868.0,"Not a doctor.

Shhhh..."
facepalm,fedii64,t1_fediawh,1579012394.0,I'm not a doctor. Have him pee on a stick. Any stick should work.
facepalm,fedgpqy,t1_fedgbuk,1579011061.0,The bottom half? I'm not sure though. I missed the second day of that lesson.
