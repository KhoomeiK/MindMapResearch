legaladvice,ffah8g4,t1_ffag96o,1579735682.0,"I bought the property one year ago. There are things crossed out on the title policy that I apparently didn’t see at the time, but certainly indicates that the title company, lender and my realtor were aware but didn’t inform me. 

This is an old house and old fence. The property has been bought and sold numerous times. I’m pretty sure that the previous owners had no idea either."

That said, I would personally not include a new love on this sort of occasion (although I have not found that myself), but perhaps it gives your father strength and comfort. 

Your sacrifices are commendable, and I would suggest that if you can’t have an honest conversation about this with your dad that you allow him this. 

There is really no one who can replace another important person in our lives.  There are only those who can make it easier."
