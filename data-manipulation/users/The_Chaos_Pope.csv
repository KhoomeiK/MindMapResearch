I don't have a single ""go-to"" favorite drink but there's a couple bottles I keep in my bar:  
Glenmorangie 10 - Nice, friendly, light, with good malt notes and some good fruity notes as well. It's a really nice, easily approachable drink. All of this said, there's still a nicely complicated flavor profile and when I drink it neat there's a great evolution to the flavors as you go from the nose to the aftertaste. 
Hibiki Harmony - Japanese whisky, it can be a bit harder to track down and tends to be on the more expensive side but it's an amazingly smooth drink with absolutely no bite at all. The nose is floral and the taste is of a honeyed fruit sitting in a oak bowl but it's so much more than that, There's this layering of flavors with a subtle evolution that helps to make this a fabulous whisky to sip on a warm evening.  
Some type of Islay scotch - For this, I used to keep a Laphroaig 10 but at this point I've got 4 or 5 bottles that hit this note so I let my last bottle of the Laphroaig 10 go without being replaced. Lately, I have a bottle of Lagavulin 16 that's been my go to for when I want something peaty. Once that's gone, I'll probably crack open the bottle of Laphroag Lore that I've been sitting on for a while but that's a pretty spendy bottle. 

Just because I was suddenly curious about it, I just went and counted the different whisky bottles in my bar and found 16 different bottles. 

If I'm at a whisky bar, I'll check their list for something I haven't tried yet because there's still so much I haven't tried. 

For not-whisky drinks, I'm pretty lazy about this so if I'm at home and making something for myself I usually go the easy route and go for some kind of alcohol + mixer. Vodka tonic used to be a staple but I don't go for these nearly as frequently since I started getting into whisky. If I'm at a bar, it'd going to depend if they're known for. For beers, I'll check the tap list and see if they've got a good IPA on tap or something REALLY malty. Mixed drinks, I love me a good mojito but I'll check their specialty list and see if anything looks interesting. Tiki drinks are always fun. 

Non-alcoholic drinks - For some reason, I've been put in charge of drinks for family gatherings. Probably because I'm terrible in the kitchen but outside of knowing how to stock a bar, I'm a lousy bartender. Problem here is that my dad doesn't drink so I have to find something palatable for him. My favorite option I've found here was [Maine Root Root Beer](https://www.maineroot.com/root-beer-soda). It tastes like root beer but turned up to 11. It's got great carbonation balance but most of the bite still comes from the spices and while I suspect it would be amazing with a good ice cream in a float, I've yet to try it. Problem here is that I've only found one store that stocks the stuff nearby and frequently when I'm there, they're out of stock. 

Do I think we are alone in the universe? I hope that there's other intelligent life out there but I think it's more likely that we are. I don't think we've been visited at all by alien life and that the rumors about ""flying saucers in the desert"" is a great way for the US Government to cover up their flight tests for prototype aircraft, primarily the early stealth craft but there's certainly been others before these."

I think that Jellico is as much of a victim in this situation as most of the rest of the crew of the Enterprise. He's inflexible in his command style and expects the crew to conform to him rather than the other way around. That said, I feel his only truly unreasonable request is to suddenly shift from a 3 shift rotation to a 4 shift rotation. This would be a pretty drastic lifestyle shift for the crew and to expect people to suddenly have to completely shift their entire life to fill out a 4th crew rotation for absolutely no valid reason is really fucking terrible. 

Getting the engineering team to increase engine efficiency? While it's not a great idea to crunch the timeframe for this, more engine efficiency isnt a bad thing. It's clear that Commander LaForge didnt believe it was an impossible task but that it would be labor intensive to accomplish. To be honest, I think that LaForge probably had this project on the back burner and probably was working on it himself or with other engineering crew as time allowed. 

All this said, Picard and Jellico apparently come from 2 different schools of thought when it comes to things and the entire thing stinks of some Admiral having a burr up their butt about Picard (cough cough Nechayev cough cough) and wanted to replace him with someone who understands the chain of command ""better""."

Warframe,fehffk6,t3_ep5tng,1579115428.0,"If you want to do sorties, learn how to do the spy missions and the tricks within them. With 4 people and 3 nodes, it's likely that everyone's going to be counting on you to get whichever node you went to in order to get through this mission and move to the next. You cant count on having ciphers available and there's likely to be 1-3 panels you'll need to hack successfully before getting the data. 

All three nodes need to be hacked successfully or the mission is a failure. 

You dont need to have a stealth frame but it can be extremely helpful while you get the feel for the nodes. Always keep in mind that there's going to be some randomness thrown in and guards can be patrolling where you wouldn't normally expect.

Edit: Weapon Restrictions - Some sortie missions will restrict you to a specific weapon type (assault rifle, shotgun, melee, sniper, secondary or bow) . Build up a good general purpose load out for one of each weapon type. These missions shouldn't have any additional damage reduction other than typical enemy types so best DPS in whatever manner you prefer."
