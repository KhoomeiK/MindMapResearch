The characters often seem kind of similar too, I feel like it makes the game less exciting overall. Personally, I'd rather see characters from entirely new games that haven't been featured in Smash yet just for the sake of variety (which was one of the big original draws of the series)."

-Get a 3D printer for projects in various hobbies

-Get some more wood-working tools along with some nice wood, I always wanted a lathe...

-Update my outdoor gear

-Buy a full frame camera body ^(using a refurbed crop sensor Canon 7D, which is nice for long shots, but less so for wide stuff)

-Buy a decent macro or tilt-shift lens (right now I'm using screw on macro filters for my 100-300 for close up stuff and a Lensbaby for macros)

-Maybe buy a couple guns I've been eyeing (the Henry AR-7 and some sort of pump action 12 ga, probably Mossberg)

-Buy a year of lessons to continue learning Muay Thai or start learning Krav Maga or Jiu Jitsu

-Fix up my kitchen (I need a new sink and the plumbing is messed up), maybe get a kitchen gadget or two, and of course, quality ingredients to make some really great food

-Possibly learn a new musical instrument, always thought the double bass was cool

-Get nicer tools for the garage, maybe fix up a couple things on my car and my girl's car"

 For some, and definitely for me, it's that we don't want too many characters from any one game: We'd rather see more unique characters than 6-8 samey characters because it makes the game more boring. 

Variety is part of the appeal of this series."

The game isn't super popular in most of the world really, but they still have at least 8 characters in Smash for some reason. Personally, I think 8 is too much  for any game.

The characters often seem kind of similar too, I feel like it makes the game less exciting overall. Personally, I'd rather see characters from entirely new games that haven't been featured in Smash yet just for the sake of variety (which was one of the big original draws of the series)."
