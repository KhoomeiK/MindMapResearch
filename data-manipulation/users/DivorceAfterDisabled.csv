intj,ffbav2i,t1_ffb49ik,1579757873.0,"I started decades ago.  Bought a camera, took some photos, read every book I could locate at the library, took Photo I in high school, learned about aperture, film speed, shutter speeds, composition, lens selection, and it really snowballed from there:  yearbook staff, photo II, newspaper staff, photo editor, college student publications, etc.

You don't have to go full SLR at first, but having different lenses helps; I mean zooms are fine, but IMHO people don't really learn how to frame photos with them.  A decent point and shoot is a good option as a starter, way less money and still quality stuff.  I have a Canon G16 that I'm real happy with and use when I don't want to break out the big guns.

Rule of Thirds will be your friend; think of it as a giant tic-tac-toe board (grid) on the viewfinder.  Place the main subject at one of the 4 intersections and your pictures will be 300% better than general snapshots.   Look at 'best photos of the year' entries and winners, see how they are framing, notice the lenses they are using.

Change your perspective.  Kneepads are one of the best investments you can make to improve your photography.  Get close, get high, move to the side, but don't just stand there pointing the camera at a slight angle downward.  ""Go wide or go tight"".  My ideal setup back in the film days was a 24mm on one camera and a 135mm or 200mm on the other.

I mean, if you have a smart phone, you have a camera, and can get some decent shots (I know peopel who've published entire books of shots just from their cellphones; granted already amazing photographers before the invention of them, but you get the idea), remember that it does have different focal lengths, pinch zoom.  Adjust the settings to show the grid.  Start with well lit situations and subjects, trying to learn in low lite is just not going to work.  Oh, if you do start just with your phone, transfer the photos to an actual computer to look at them.  Same thing with a point and shoot, avoid ""chimping"" after each shot.  I turn my back panel display off when taking photos and only look in select situations.

good luck, and shoot well."
Enneagram,ffazlh9,t1_ff8ulqt,1579748164.0,"Similar to you but add in 3 family deaths, 3 TBIs including a car accident, getting laid off, spine surgery, 4 other physical issues, wife filing for divorce, hearing loss, tinnitus, chronic pain, endrocine issue, had to sell my house, start custody, and try to figure out what I can do for a living now that I can't do the job I've done for 25+ years.   All of this in the last 4 years.

It's amazing how much nutrition and taking a balanced body approach to things makes things better.  Acute treatments might be helpful when you have 1 or 2 isolated issues.  When everything hits, it's harder to separate and takes a different approach."

I graduated in the top 19% of my class, so I needed lower SAT/ACT scores to get into colleges because my academic standing was higher.  I didn't get smarter by changing schools, the methodology they used was a less penal system.  The difference between an 88 and a 90 went from 1.0 to 0.2."

My 2nd HS had a different system, they took your grade: 92, 87, etc and divided by 10, so 9.2 and 8.7 respectively and you overall average was flagged out of 10.   In the traditional system an 80 is the same as an 89 (both a 3.0), which is 25% less than a 90 (a 4.0)."

Latin, Biology, Geometry, PE, Language Arts, Photography I, and Astronomy?  no, that was 11th grade concurrent with Chemistry.    What the hell 7 required classes do you have to take?

Maybe look at a 3-4 year old used one that's decked out like you want, probably going to be 1/2 the price, and it's got that Toyota build, just like your Honda, so you know the engine will be solid or years.

good luck"
INTP,fdy2d7y,t3_enci9k,1578775318.0,"For me a car is a car, not a status symbol.  Yes, just because I don't value it that way doesn't mean others don't.  I don't drive a beater, but a 13 year old Prius; it gets me from A to B and still gets 48mpg.   It's starting to show signs of wear and could use some visual TLC, but it still functions at 95%, so the visuals are of less concern for me right now.

That just seems like a lot of cash to outlay at once; the income from that money could do me better than a ""fancy"" car right now given my situation.  Again, that's just where my value judgement lies.

As far as the picture of the car, it doesn't seem too over the top; just a lot of flash for me.  Drawing attention to myself isn't something I do as a default."
hsp,fdy0pxa,t3_en0d3g,1578774839.0,"Death is a weird thing.  In the last 4 years I've lost an uncle, grandmother, and an aunt (just last month).  In between I've had multiple head injuries, car accident, laid off, spine surgery, wife filed for divorce, custody started, and had to move.  Separating all of those items intertwined with the family deaths has been hard.  Oh yea, and the death of two cats in the last 10 years as well.

How have I been dealing with it? good question.  I don't really know how each individual item has hit me, and untangling everything separately is most difficult.

I've accepted the limited existence of life decades ago, I think that has helped.  The concepts of Stoicism and Buddhism have helped.  Getting in tune with the processes of nature is always a positive, or at least can allow you to see ""the reason"" behind things a bit more.  I'm not saying one can just forget, I still cry over the loss of one of my cats from 35 years ago, along with several aunts, uncles, cousins, grandmothers, and friends.

It can be very weird at times as both of you are very similar and if you are out of phase on the same topic, you're saying the same things yet the timing is all off; you need to slow down and attempt to merge the cogs to where they're moving at the same pace, or at least similar.

You're both going to be stubborn.  Imagine y'all are a rubber band with the two of you as poles inside the rubber band, you need to find other anchor points so it doesn't become completely stretched out and could snap.

Hopefully the two of you are doing nerdy things together and can feed off of each other.  My son and I watch shows together, and both play the same video game.  I don't play all of the same games he does, but having that one contact point it important. We watch separate shows as well, but always try to get together to watch some things together.  The Walking Dead, Rick and Morty, documentaries (cat, science, history, NOVA, Nature), Fairy Tail, Doctor Who, Monty Python, Austin Powers, etc.
