New Wave fan here. When it get close to your date check [late bar's website](http://music.latebarchicago.com) to see what they have going on (Bowie night, new Wave night if your lucky, Sat. DJ is great).  I have also heard Exit, Deliah's, and sometimes Beauty Bar rock it too. Beauty Bar only does new wave once in a while though. 

Also, for Aragon brawl room, there is old people seating upstairs (sometimes and extra fee, sometimes a get there early and run on up) Drinks cost a dime but good acustics and old school punk vibe if you have never been. Have fun! 

OH, and, if you do want a drink before,  check out the Green Mill across the street if you have time. There is an Al Capone booth from when he would frequent the place."

stopdrinking,ffi401q,t3_etq6jx,1579964429.0,"In this community, you will not find many people (if any) who call a drinking concern over dramatic at all. If you think it's problematic, that's enough. People don't have to be what a movie portrays as an alcoholic to have a problem with alcohol. 

It sounds like drinking makes you think about your other negative experiences with alcohol, and it sounds like you don't want it to detract from your own wellbeing. What, then, is the benifit on drinking? It doesn't taste good. It's full of empty calories. It can make depression and anxiety worse. It makes you feel like crap the next day if you have too much of it.... 

Sure. It's a social lubricant... But one that stops you from building on your real social skills as an adult because it's just a crunch. Sure, it helps with depression/anxiety in the moment because it gives you a break, but, it sounds like the rebound effect erases that in worrying about what else it is doing to you. 

So? Welcome to the stop drinking community. I whole heatedly encourage you to give it a drytry. There is no shame in being a sober person of any age for any reason. If you need help stopping, I encourage you to get counseling or telecouseling. IWNDWYT."

Judaism,ffco2dn,t1_ffcg2vf,1579803566.0,"To clarify.... modern Unitarians do not believe in Jesus as a Messiah, but look at him as a great teacher instead. Their faith pulls from Christian, Jewish, and other world religion teachings. Most Unitarian Churches are also universilist- they believe in many paths being possibly ""right"" and they encourage you to find your own way in their community. Many UU communities are welcoming of diverse viewpoints, but, may be too spiritual as opposed to relgious for your taste. That said, I would encourage you to go attend a UU service and see what you think. If you can, go to at least two different UU churches as they each vary a little in theology.

If you are settled on exploring Jewish conversion, I would still encourage you to visit a variety of Jewish faith communities. There are many, many ways to be practice the faith. I would visit a conservative temple first, then reformed, and last orthadox if you wish. Some orthadox communities are less welcoming to visitors or those seeking conversion, but of course that's not always the case. It would be good to call/email before you go if you are comfortable doing so."

2. Liking males as a female doesn't cancel your bi identify. It's the other portion of being bi! You could marry a male identifing person and still be bi. Dreams, crushes, fantasies don't suddenly disappear when you have a long term partner and you may find some variety in those that straight people don't, and maybe you express who you are even a bit differently because of that.
3. Exploration is very normal. Just because you don't have  maybe direct experience with a same sex partner that doesn't make you ""straight"" unless you view yourself as such.
