aww,fekqin4,t1_fejug1d,1579205523.0,We found that to be the case with the toy that is a ring with a ball inside.  Our pair tend to forget that it exists until one of us moves it and then it is like I bought them a brand new toy.
entitledparents,fek7hbl,t3_eph9kb,1579194207.0,"Our family had trained our Siamese and Maine Coon to walk on a leash from 4 months old.  Both boys were very laid back and visited the nursing home that my mother worked in as pet therapy animals.

One day I had Tasslehoff (the maine coon) visiting a woman who told me that she really liked my dog.  I corrected her and said he was a cat.

""No, that's too big to be a cat.""  He was not even full grown yet but weighed 14lbs at this time. ""That's a dog.""

""I'm sorry, but he is a cat.""

""I don't like cats,"" she stated.

""Ok,"" I said.  ""It's a dog."""
cats,fds04mo,t1_fdrlh5u,1578692286.0,"Agreed.  My ex and his wife have 3 sisters.  One was affectionate from the beginning, one grew into it and the 3rd just started this past summer.  And that one barely tolerates her sisters.  Only living thing she liked in the past was my boy that my ex cat-sat for 2 months while I was in the process of relocating.  

They have had them for 5.5 years.  

Side note.  Ex cat-sat a blue girl and smoke tabby male.  The girl would not let either my ex or his wife touch her until the last 2 weeks they had her (total of 11) but the boy was all over them.  In my house, he will hide in the bathroom and howl for hours while she will pop out after an hour.  I think she figures they can't be all bad if I still have them in the house and she will get curious."
cats,fdnt4as,t3_em2tbh,1578592298.0,"Love the name. 

Keep in mind this is coming from someone that used to have a cat named Carrot.  (Not a red cat, just named after a character in a book by Terry Pratchett.)"
aww,fdlavw2,t3_elpmx1,1578520122.0,Absolutely gorgeous.
cats,fdla5eh,t3_eluyum,1578519690.0,I <3 the boop button!
cats,fdkmndq,t3_elul7h,1578506723.0,"It's in the top 5.

But then, my Mature (10yr old) Princess Grumpy Pants demanding that I lift the blanket this morning so that she could get under the covers to spoon is, at this time, number 1."
cats,fcz00js,t3_ej7dnb,1578090866.0,"He is looking at the camera like he is planning my death.

I think I love him."
cats,fclflzo,t1_fcjnu9i,1577746661.0,I thought that looked like Nelly as well.  Kitchen matches the one from YouTube as well.
aww,fbxx4c7,t3_eewkif,1577202770.0,I would name it Needles
