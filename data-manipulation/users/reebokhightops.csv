The horrifically systemic issues that plague our police departments aside, there are plenty of decent cops out there who really want to make a positive difference in their communities. If you can justify celebrating the death of that sort of person because of a perceived ideological difference, you are a complete and total piece of shit.

Edit: you just commented on another video this afternoon that you’d have liked for the police to exhibit brutality in that instance. So depending on who it is, you’re either okay with police brutalizing the public or you think the police should be killed. Very sound reasoning."

INAT,fdnne0u,t1_fdnhsbm,1578589403.0,"Sounds like you have a good sense for this stuff then. I didn’t mean it as a criticism, as I had to overcome that very obstacle myself. Honestly I find it a bit disheartening how quickly some folks are panned for not having a more technical skill set. There are definitely hobbyist designers out there who have tremendous ideas and are entirely capable of managing projects and leading teams, and I’ve seen a few of those folks run out of this sub on occasion. 

Anyway, I hope you get some responses. Good luck with your project!"
INAT,fdnf6pj,t3_emauug,1578584508.0,"Sounds like a fun little idea. Unfortunately, unless you can program or make art or models, you are what is referred to as an “idea guy” (or gal in this case). 

The conventional wisdom is that ideas are a dime a dozen, no matter how great they may be on paper. Unless you can contribute something *tangible* to the project, your collaborators are essentially **making your project for you — for free**. 

That’s a tough pill to swallow when you have a real passion for the concept, but what you have to do is dive into some simple programming tutorials and begin working towards being able to prototype some of these mechanics yourself. It’s not as hard as it probably sounds, but it does take commitment and perseverance. You could also start drawing and see whether you can work up to a sufficient skill level to contribute some of the art work. That will at least give you a leg to stand on in trying to convince people to lend their time and talents."
wow,fdn9teh,t1_fdn8kxh,1578581067.0,"It’s absurd to call someone argumentative when you are hurling insults at them and being condescending just because they have a different perspective — especially if the subject is ultimately unimportant. We may disagree, but look at what we are talking about and ask yourself why that’s such a problem. 

You shouldn’t be triggered by normal discourse. If you’re so worked up by someone else that you can’t even discuss your own opinion without insulting people, maybe you should take a break from Reddit. 

If you want just want to be super aggro and insufferable, at least own it. It’s lame but this is the anonymous internet and you can do what you want. But for fucks sake, don’t paint other people as unreasonable when you are the one absolutely refusing not to be an inflammatory asshole.
