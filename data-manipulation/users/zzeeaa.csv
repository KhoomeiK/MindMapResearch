Just because you wouldn't date Justin doesn't mean that Katie can't. You're not the boss of who your friends like or what they value in relationships. Unless there's something wrong with the way he's treating your friend, then stay out of it.

It sounds like Katie is growing up and realising that she should go with what brings her happiness rater than going along with the herd. You should consider doing the same.

I'm a professor who sometimes teaches 3 hour blocks. I personally think they're too long, and its irritating when we are forced to use one hour for student interaction.

She may well have felt sad to have her frustrations validated, but the sadness isn't necessarily directed at you. We have less control over our timetable than you might think. This kind of work is often handed out by people who don't have to do it themselves.

If you really like the subject, give her a compliment and/or leave one when you're asked to evaluate the class. We can use positive feedback for promotions, prizes, etc. so it actually is quite meaningful. It also feels good to know that our students are happy overall - despite annoying modes of delivery."
