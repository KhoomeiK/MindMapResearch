Dogtraining,fgd80tc,t3_exugm0,1580679811.0,Not sure what your financial situation is but could you put him in daycare a few days a week (even half days) so he can play with other dogs? Honestly if he's getting 2 walks a day and basic necessities of life he has a better life than a lot of dogs (assuming these are longer walks than out to pee and right back inside).
dogs,ffq7quf,t3_euj5v0,1580124898.0,"All of the breeds on your list that I'm familiar with (the more common ones you're likely to find in a shelter) are over 40 lbs, so you probably don't need to worry too much about breed and just focus on finding a dog with the right personality under the weight limit as you're narrowing things down."
dogs,ffq6lbs,t3_euivda,1580123260.0,"I'm not sure about puppies, but in adult dogs (and people for that matter) you have to keep in mind the idea of sensitization vs. desensitization. If you expose her to a scary stimulus too quickly she's just going to become more fearful of it. You need to desensitize her - keep her under threshold (start far away, give high value treats) and move closer slowly. Look up counter conditioning. Socialization is important, but if a dog is freaking out you've probably done too much too fast."
dogs,ffmzis1,t1_ffmium6,1580060478.0,I wouldn't let the dog on the bed but even so maybe wash the sheets at least once a week.
dogs,ffjr3cf,t1_ffjqki7,1580004746.0,I guess it's just a weird angle where you can't see the longer teeth.
dogs,ffjqxzp,t3_etyr5m,1580004651.0,Take the dog to get a bath and blow dry frequently with the high power blow dryers that they have at dog grooming places. That should help a lot with the shedding. Keep the house clean and wash sheets often.
