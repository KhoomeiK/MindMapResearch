worldnews,fduauta,t3_en2bxz,1578730571.0,"Again, it's not. It wasn't an unsanctioned assassination, it was a bombing resulting in the death of a general, that was the provoked by multiple aggressive actions by Iran. Trump did absolutely nothing illegal or immoral here, because it was provoked. And even if it was unprovoked, that doesn't excuse anything. That's like saying the allies were 100% responsible for the holocaust because their harsh punishment of germany after ww1 let Hitler rise to power. Did Trump contribute with the bombing? Yes, but that doesn't mean it was his fault."

worldnews,fdtuka5,t1_fdtswxe,1578722440.0,"Except it's not. Trump didn't shoot down a passenger plane. ""Oh but he started this conflict!!"" Nope, didn't do that either. The months leading up to the bombing that killed the general Iran had made plenty of attacks against the US, such as the attack on the US embassy that trigged the bombing response in the first place. And even if he had started it, it still isn't his fault that a political enemy shot down a fucking plane."

ABoringDystopia,fcsxfvu,t1_fcswjwc,1577927554.0,"Absolutely. This sort of thing is what I believe is behind this recent wave of extremism. A lot of young white men (the average race and age for a mass shooter in america) feel targeted in todays society from the more extreme vocal minority of the left, which when you mix that with difficulties in getting a job nowadays, the negative effect social media can have on your self esteem, and the incredible tension between not only political views, but also races and sexes, it's no wonder extremist organizations find it so easy to recruit people."
todayilearned,fcsw6cg,t3_eiox3l,1577926649.0,So did he find them?
ABoringDystopia,fcsvs0r,t1_fcsv7te,1577926363.0,"Exactly my point. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Anita is good whatsoever, and even if what she was complaining about was accurate (which it largely wasn't), she surrounded it with so many petty insults that the original point was lost. 

Her, and everyone like her, stirred this aggression with how they handled everything. Of course, that doesn't excuse the vitriolic bullshit that a vocal minority of gamers say, but my point is that it's really not surprising a lot of gamers are right leaning now."
ABoringDystopia,fcsska5,t3_eim9fn,1577924036.0,"Maybe this says something about how the left may feel to a more centrist group like gaming. Look at Anita Sarkeesian for example. Her alone probably pushed a lot of people to the right, with how aggressively she insulted people just playing video games. Those insults turned people off to the left, regardless of whether or not she was making a genuine point about diversity in game or how female characters can be treated. So, now whenever any of those leftist topics get brought up, a lot of people immediately get defensive, thinking either them or the hobby they devote so much time to is being insulted without any basses. Anita isn't the only person that contributed to it of course, but she was the big name that started it. Add in the fact that people generally don't like it when somebody on the outside tries to censor something they like, which a lot of leftist did and continue to do, and it honestly makes complete sense why so many of them don't align themselves with the left."

AskReddit,fcm9f2x,t1_fcm4spf,1577767808.0,"Well...that's a little sexist. Word of advice, don't let personal experience completely define what you think about a group. That's how we get racists and over all unpleasant people. I haven't met a single guy that condones cheating, but I have met women that jump to excuses when it comes out that a women cheated on her husband. Generally speaking, both sexes have shitheads, and comparing which gender does which shitty act slightly more is unproductive and only divides us."
