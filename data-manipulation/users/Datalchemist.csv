A one man/women assembly line is a good thing when you’re putting your life together. Like pieces of a train, follow your train of thought until your brain shuts the fuck up, at least just a little."
offmychest,ffc6u8r,t1_ffc1wbh,1579792892.0,"Np, feel the same way."
offmychest,ffbeq80,t3_espcdd,1579762109.0,"I cant begin to understand what you’re going through but this is my advice. Write your pain. Just jot down what you feel not in abstract terms like anxiety but really go for something that sounds like it. Dig deep until your face is covered in dirt, until you see something new."
offmychest,ffb0cax,t1_ffazaw8,1579748668.0,"Glad I’m not alone, thanks."
offmychest,ffazfyj,t3_esi5ke,1579748061.0,"I’m right there with you. I’m a shut in loser and when I do leave my room I’m funny and confident. So that’s what people expect from me. All my brothers, mom and dad are all failures and outcasts. My father has never been there for me, my mom is complacent, my brothers are failures and on and on. So I have to be this perpetual shining beacon of hope. I can’t be sad because as soon as I do it might all come crumbling down. So I can’t be vulnerable until I succeed and I can’t be happy because I don’t have anyone I can confide in. It’s this vicious cycle."
offmychest,ffaxeg6,t3_esmetw,1579746709.0,I push away family because they are too weak for me to be vulnerable around them. There is so much pain and failure that I have to be the one to pick up the mantle. I’m trying to make friends but I’m too open about my emotions with them which pushes them away. To be fair I’m a huge shut in meaning social interaction is kind of confusing to me. I can be the life of the party but I can also be a walking nightmare spouting off about my baggage. So I’m kind of stuck being that awkward guy. Lesson learned I guess.
offmychest,ffawtbv,t3_esmfsc,1579746321.0,"Same here. A friend of mine said she has no money to hang out and then I check her insta and there she is eating at a fancy restaurant. Fuck her and fuck him for ignoring me on social. I’ll make new friends if that’s what it takes. 

There’s this app called meetup I use it to make friends. That and I don’t have to feels as lonely. 

We are all beautiful to someone. Don’t worry too much about it. If they don’t wanna hang just try and make new friends."

writing,ff8brse,t3_es63b9,1579672159.0,"The same reason you hang with family and friends. It’s just a waste of time, all of it is. The truth is that many writers join writing circles so they can identify and then  they get caught up in competition. The goal becomes that of a romantic novel or heroes journey of sorts. The irony right? But if you can’t deal with the fact that for many writing should be like a memory. You can only shelter it for so long before your high school chess trophies get played out. You’re looking for a sword that you can swing around like a bad ass and then conflating that with catharsis (u get from writing) and while you can that doesn’t mean it’s a good story to win the metaphorical lottery."
writing,ff80gpi,t3_es4ehq,1579662782.0,I tend to write very little maybe a page a day and I find on editing that I get a sudden burst of inspiration. It’s weird for me. On top of that I like what I’m writing but lately I don’t feel like it’s good but I know that it is. I guess I’m just kind of depressed atm. It’s strange to be able to write and do it well but not be interested in it at the same time.

2meirl4meirl,ff2dq3s,t3_er5twd,1579501967.0,I have a few just none of them on the internet. I’m a recovering shut in. Felt the need to add that in there for some reason.
booksuggestions,ff2bsr3,t3_er8ky0,1579499979.0,Elenor Oliphant is Completely Fine. One of my favorites as a serial shut in.
writing,ff2bnpd,t3_er47bh,1579499837.0,"I can’t seem to find something that grabs me. It feels like everyone wants to be the next Michael Bay of writing. Stories about murder, futurism, fantasy and while I don’t mind them I just can’t seem to find something I’m really into. So far the only thing I’ve liked is the Immoralists and Elenor Oliphant and that’s basically it lol. I guess I’m just a picky ass hole too fickle and negative to give things a try. Gonna give reading a another go. 

On a side note what books do you recommend that revolve around every day life with an emphasis on family and relationships."
loveaddiction,fezpgcl,t3_eqrmlz,1579460017.0,"Something people forget is that we all have this beautiful and painful story that we tell ourselves. Sadness, anger, frustration etc can feel mundane but that’s only half the equation. It’s the formula but the execution is what inspires people to smile and tear up. There’s a story even in feeling like you have no story is a story. Confront yourself in novel form or paint or whatever medium."
loveaddiction,fezo6qs,t3_eqrmlz,1579459579.0,Reverse engineer your reasoning. Emotion isn’t just poetry. Work to understand what you feel by writing and then act accordingly. Your mind is unconsciously putting two and two together for u since u don’t address the issues. Write it all down (talk with someone about it if u want) since that can help too.
C_S_T,fewyi2c,t3_eqnrge,1579421437.0,"Everything is mental masturbation. Passion, love, opinions, beliefs etc. it’s all an inescapable journey. You can switch lanes but no matter what you are on train. To break down and reassemble people is a stroke of genius and yes, mental masturbation."
