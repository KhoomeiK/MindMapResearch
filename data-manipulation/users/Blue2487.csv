CallOfDutyMobile,ff3kvcr,t1_ff3fny2,1579543207.0,"Because rookie and vetran ranks don’t let you loose rank for loosing, they’re pretty easy and go by relatively quickly

Best case scenario, you can get around 60+ points per win (yes, even in elite, which means rookie and veterans can can go by super fast). And that’s if you do aaamaaaazinggg every single round. So lets bump that down to, you’re pretty good and you average about 30+ (accounting for losses, brining it down to that number, which is a pretty bad case scenario). To get from elite (which is were its starting to get a bit more competitive, but like what you’ll probably have to focus on) to pro 2, you have to go from 2000 points to 3300 to get locus. **That’s almost 70 games**. 

Now of course, if you’re doing better/ getting lucky or have a squad, it’ll happen a lot sooner in around 40 games.

Really I think you should shoot for it. I probably made it sound hard, but the system has only gotten more forgiving over the seasons.

Another thing, if you do crazy good and still *loose*, you can still net positive points even in pro and stuff for carrying the team but still loosing.

For reference, I played yesterday for about 4-6 hours off and on, I was doing terrible and often placed last in my team, I still was able to get from elite 1 (which is where my rank reset) to elite 4.

Edit: I’ve also played just under 25 games. You could probably get to pro 2 in 40, but 60-70 is still a nice expectation. Idk how bad you are, you’re probably not that bad. Try it"

Highest pulmino I saw was 1100+. Took ages to kill the mate boosted ones. Health wasn’t a biggest issue, lowest I got was about 5k on a 6k mount. Torpor scared me though.

The thing about the world I’m playing in is that I started it in hard, so everything in caves and above ground spawned hard levels, but then I switched it to medium bc I didn’t want to grind that much, but I did get an above medium cap bary. Level 366 I think. Had just enough knockback to keep the pulmino at bay.

AskReddit,felgt5u,t3_epkaux,1579221829.0,"Not the *most* but an interesting story nonetheless

I grew up in a very good home where I taught numerous things like right and wrong and such. A lot of the people I met and interacted with at an early age were apart of the same religion and thus had the same ideals. Among these, was being taught that you shouldn’t lie, so I grew up telling the truth and believing what I was told and I was used to being believed. 

This mindset was reinforced by the fact that I was homeschooled, so I continued to get even more used to all the honesty. But then in 5th grade I went to public school. My first day I was getting to meet people, and one of the people ran off into the crowd, and a few seconds later somebody comes up to me and asks if I had seen where they had gone.

Me, being honest, told him “he went right” to which the person replied “oh, he must have gone left then.” And that caused reality to really hit me. That people aren’t always honest. That people don’t just believe that you’re an honest person automatically. And maybe, the world wasn’t the kind of place that I thought it was, and was possibly a bit more corrupt than I thought...

I know its silly, just a simple “oh u lie” but it really made reality hit me hard in the face."
