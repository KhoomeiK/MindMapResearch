There are litterally 25 cars chasing down one puny ice cream truck. When there's shooting involved, there's hundreds of bullets fired, often at unarmed perps. It's extremely over the top every time. I remember listening to a podcast about this guy who were suspected of bringing classified material home with him before leaving a government job. The sheer volume of cars and people that descended on his house was astounding. Just like in the show. Over 20-30 vehicles, swat teams, hazmat teams, mobile vans, FBI, DEA, local PD, and every other acronym. It was like a small town military invasion. All to look for a tiny rock-like substance.

politics,fdlvewb,t3_elr57t,1578533409.0,"They never will as long as Bernie doesn't become president. The high cost for college is one of their main strategies to keep people enlisting in the military as either a means to pay for college or as an alternative just to put food on the table. The US is a war mongering country unlike any other and it's their favorite past time. Their country's second largest company by employees is the military, which is insane, with 1.3 million active employees, beaten only by Walmart at 2.2m. If the US don't keep making it impossible for the average person to go to college, or get a job, their workforce stream will be halted. It's simple as that. That's why the US always somehow perpetually find some new enemy in a cave somewhere in the middle east that requires trillion dollar aircraft carriers and hundreds of thousands of troops. This is what you get when the people who run the government at the highest level also own the companies that makes their weapons, bullets and military gear, like Dick Cheney during the Bush administration. It's an endless spiral of fucked-upness that is so fucked up it's hard to believe. 


In the same way prisons and judges are owned by the same people, sustaining a system that purposely targets black people and persecute them severely harder than white people, and at an alarmingly higher rate of x5. A staggering 33% of all blacks end up in jail at one point in their life. When you go to jail in the US you lose the right to vote. Effectively knee capping the number of eligible black voters. Keeping positions of government supremely white.

Edit: And since you're so keen on officialness, Soleimani was an Iranian major general in the IRGC. i.e. a soldier. Answering to the Supreme Leader of Iran. He was the second most powerful man in Iran, but a soldier nonetheless. Was it a bad move to kill the MVP of the Iranian army? yes of course.

I'm European and I've never heard of anyone openly caring or lying about what is clearly visible. I think it's because you use the imperial system and not the metric system, and most people have no actual idea what 5'2 or 6'1 in reality actually looks like. People can understand if they are 5'0 that everyone above that number is supposed to be taller than you, but can't clearly visualize it. With the metric system, if someone says they are 182 cm tall, everyone can easily tell if that is true or not. Even on a picture. For most people it is very easy to visualize 60 cm or 163 cm.

politics,fdhlxof,t1_fdg9p3b,1578425447.0,"If I support the axis and you support the allies, we're at war whether we admit it or not. The US and Iran have quietly been at war for over a decade. The general was in a war zone in Iraq, not holidaying in Macau. Iran is supporting anti American militia in the region, attacking both the Iraqi and the US troops. Soleimani was the leader of that support. There is a clear chain of events leading up to the attack, but you don't really seem interested in all the facts, only those that support your narrative.

Soleimani shouldn't have been in a war zone adminitering attacks on US troops and not expect the possibility of becoming a target himself. Especially when he just a couple of days ago had his groups fire a rocket on a US military base in the region. The US just have bigger and better rockets."

politics,fdg8c7y,t3_el3ik6,1578384311.0,"Most people are missing the big picture here. To sum it up here's what happened. The US executed a preemtive strike and killed the Iranian general, in a war zone in Iraq, but also as retaliation for the attack on a US military base in Iraq and death of a US contractor. Both Iraqi and US military personell took damage. The attack was lead by military groups backed by Iran according to both US and Iraqi intelligence. Now Iran has vowed to revenge the strike and also as response to the US' threat of sanctions. Trump has interpreted said vow as a threat, and threatened back, quite brutally.  


My point is this: This is war, they were both in a war zone, in another foreign country shooting each other with rockets, tanks and drones. What did they expect? No one dying? These are just threaths, which is something you are required to make when you're at war. This tiny war in Iraq just went from being unheard of in mainstream media, to the public eye due to the US killed a VIP. But to be fair. Trump is actually just doing his job here. He takes advice from his generals and intelligence services and gives the go ahead on said advice. Trump, for all his flaws, at least knows how to make a threat."

NoStupidQuestions,fd746nk,t3_ejvguu,1578199204.0,"I believe it's the same in every language. Not over simple stuff like then/than, but grammar in general in one's native language. Since it's your native language people will underestimate the value of really paying attention since everyone have the feeling they're already fluent in their language and therefore need spend less time and effort maintaining/practicing their native grammar skills. Once people graduate high school, it also becomes one's own job to maintain, which very few people do. I know a lot of people in my country if asked on the spot can't properly spell common everyday words correctly because of autocorrect and a lack of effort to remember. 

When you're learning English as a second language you're taught grammar much more vigorously and repetitively, and with a lot more interest I reckon. I know personally that learning English grammar at school was much more fun and interesting than in my native language.

Although, that being said, there shouldn't really be any excuses for English monolingual people having trouble with simple English grammar when they only speak one language."
