TalesFromTheCustomer,ffg75gz,t1_ffg3izl,1579899907.0,"I still have 501's from the 90's that got more and more comfortable with every wash as the years passed. Granted, I no longer fit into them, but they outlasted my waistline."
Fallout,ffep5uk,t1_ffecl2o,1579858419.0,"Only place that complaining bitch deserves to be. Yeah, I *know* she's had a hard time, but shit: I saw my spouse get shot and then was refroze just to get thawed out and save her bacon, only to have her thank me by being a smart-ass and incessantly banging on a kitchen fan vent?"

MomForAMinute,ffeo6w1,t3_et2l4u,1579856955.0,"Little Brother, there's no honest way to tell you it will be *okay*.

It won't.

But it *will* get easier. The pain will slowly dull to an emptiness, and the happy memories will grow to fill that void. Our feline family members can only keep us company for a short time, so we have to make their time meaningful for them like they do for us. You must have cared enough that Clyde surely had a joyful existence, and I'm glad he got to have you as his pet, because we know that's the way it really works.

Be strong, be glad for the time you had, and be open hearted if another furball pokes his nose at you. There could never be a replacement for our lost little ones, but sometimes we are gifted with reminders.

I said it won't be okay, but YOU will. Clyde would want you to know that, and do do I. You asked for Mom, but when I saw you and Clyde Cat, I had to send you some love and support. Take care.

Your big brother."
