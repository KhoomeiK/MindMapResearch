GriefSupport,ffe6vi2,t3_esv0s1,1579838283.0,"Hello, my dad died of cancer too. Painful and immobile. Saw him grow weak and become bedridden. 

It took a long time to have a semblance of moving forward with life. What really helped was doing mindfulness exercises for trauma. 

Look up “Anastasia Pollock Overcome Trauma With Guided Exercises.”  It’s on iTunes and Spotify. 

Instead of playing all the tracks at once, play each track individually so you have time to process before immediately going to the next track. Doing these exercises was one of the things that really helped me deal with the emotions and sadness of it all. 

The best tracks are 
Body Scan 
Noticing Thoughts 
Mindfulness of Emotional Pain

If you do these exercises daily you’ll notice the pain start to subside. Stick with it even if at first it seems like it’s hard to do so. It will help."

Forget about doing everything at once. What is one specific thing you can start doing that will get you back on track. Start doing that thing and the momentum will build."

StartingStrength,ffagtse,t1_ffacmqf,1579735417.0,"OP never said he wanted to use a belt.  Where did he say that?

Also, if lifters use a belt that ought to be reserved for higher weights after the novice and intermediate stage of training.  Using a belt in the early to intermediate stages of training results in reliance on the belt as opposed to one’s musculature.  

Belts at the novice and intermediate stages are for pussies and morons."
StartingStrength,ffa833z,t1_ffa5yrp,1579729713.0,Because the focus of starting strength is to get all your fundamentals correct in order to progress to more advanced lifting. A part of those fundamentals is to develop sufficient core stability in order to bear heavy loads during squats and deadlifts. Using a belt at this early stage is antithetical to that goal because the reliance is placed on the belt as opposed to one’s own musculature and structure.
