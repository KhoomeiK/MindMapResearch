wow,fegjck5,t1_fegaejs,1579094546.0,"You're right.

His mother was Nyxondra who was Onyxia's sister, so he \*should\* be the grandchild of Deathwing, but- and this is where I get confused - his egg was purified through a process that used one of Nyxondra's eggs and a wild black dragon egg.

However, he says multiple times in canon that Deathwing is his father. Given that I believe he also says in canon that he knew his own name when he hatched, it wouldn't surprise me if he knew who is father was.

This implies- 

1. Deathwing jumped his daughter's bones. This is TOTALLY possible but for one thing - it's mentioned that in canon Sintharia was the only one of his mates that survived doing the deed with him after his, uh, changes, and she was marked forever. Nyxondra is notably alive and unharmed because she's the one that leads the charge to get her egg back after it was stolen. 

2. Deathwing was the father of the wild egg. Which leaves so many questions that go back to the Sintharia thing and the whole purification thing. 

3. Just as likely - Blizz forgot their own lore :)

I had to go check chapter 1 of the manga again. She did kind of try to dissuade them saying ""There should be a higher ranked adventurer along in a bit to help you..."" but didn't flat out tell them WHY this was a bad idea. She might not be allowed to as part of her job.

HobbyDrama,fed97au,t1_fe9zyl7,1579004369.0,"That's just it, and what it all turns on.

Why are these naive adventurers going after them in the first place?

Higher ranking guild members don't go after goblins  because there's nothing in it FOR them. There's no gold for it. Besides, most of them didn't even know how serious a problem it was until the Farm battle and it took a lot to get them to help. \*Nobody\* takes goblins seriously. Hell, the Gold ranked character in the main city couldn't get anyone to take her mission until GS's team showed up, and she KNEW what goblins could do!

There's some implications that a lot of them got through those early guild levels by killing \*rats\*, not goblins. (I think Guild Girl actually suggested it to our main character's group, or at least one other, but no they picked goblins.)
