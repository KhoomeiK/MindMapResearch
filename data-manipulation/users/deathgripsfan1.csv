no one said you needed to be special"
DotA2,ff8k4ie,t1_ff7ivsk,1579682278.0,In some ways it's accurate yea. Recall the outpour of disappointed fans for game of thrones. Season 8 was how many hours into the story for it to just fall flat and fail.
DotA2,ff8k0ti,t1_ff7f8vj,1579682128.0,"I quit playing in December. I didn't post about it. But I still read about the game, the subreddit, and interact with the community. I didn't post because I didn't feel like posting.

But valve reads the subreddit. It's a great way for the community to tell the developers why they're not enjoying the game. TV shows for exple typically are set in stone. If you didn't enjoy this week's episode complaint about it isn't going to change next week's episode. Next season possibly, but unlikely. Video games have the ability to be a dynamic experience. Not just dota, not just multiplayer games either. Typical single player games receive updates now and feedback is important. 

There's a lot of emotional connection to dota, and for it to end for people like this is rough. People don't want it to end. And that's okay. I spent nearly 4000 hours playing dota. I got married and had a child during my tenure with dota. I am now done. And that's okay too. I spend the time I used to use for dota to do other things. I know the people who also quit playing will let valve know what I'm feeling as well."
DotA2,ff8iimb,t1_ff8iiad,1579680050.0,thanks for reading my ted talk
DotA2,ff8iiad,t1_ff8hmcr,1579680038.0,"I just read the thread echoing my complaint about mobility power creeping. I'm glad to see that others are also concerned. I don't know what the solution would be to this. Get out of jail free cards are too prevalent. A look at Ursa for example: he can manfight very well, so what do you do? Kite or disable. Now Ursa has insane movespeed, so you need better disable. New patch he has a dispel on his ult. Ok great. So you need two disables. He's still running at you but now he can jump at you or even use overwhelm on abyssal. It's crazy that was the mobility creep on Ursa alone."
DotA2,ff8i94j,t1_ff8hzbv,1579679699.0,"Mars is interesting to me, he has a kind of mobility where he traps others to play with him. He has the equivalent of a force staff, Kinect field, and atos if you get what I'm saying. 

Grimsroke used to have a lot of movespeed on his inkswell, unsure of current numbers."
DotA2,ff8hmcr,t1_ff8hadm,1579678878.0,"Along with this, heroes are getting changes and reworks to make their kits more rounded, such as bloodseeker getting bloodrite. It makes sense, rupture makes you stand still, bloodrite makes you run away. But at the same time bloodrite is an aoe waveclear nuke that makes him so similar to other aoe nukers.

Tiny had craggy removed for tree grab. Viper got nethertoxin reworked into a circle. Kotl had his ult changed into a circle. Brewmaster got a throwable circle. Lich got a new circle. Huskar got a goddamn circle. 

Dazzle was an interesting idea, they took away the circle and added a passive and is my favorite hero now. Pos 3 dazzle doing a Midas rush into micro 3 is insane. You can get anything you want on dazzle and have it be nearly perma uptime. So cool."
DotA2,ff8hadm,t1_ff8gt2s,1579678450.0,"I understand yea, there's only so much you can do with numbers alone. That's why I think poison sting now has hp regen slow. 

But heroes like grimsroke didn't need any mobility abilities to be interesting, ink swell used to give a ton of movespeed however. 

God like pango having swashbuckle, shield crash, and rolling thunder is too much. 

I think valve shouldn't be afraid of heroes having two passives. Drow had her e changed to be waveclearing/teamfighting nuke. She didn't need that. But it was derivative of the meta. Big teamfights, big esports money. Wraith king has 3 skills to click on now. The dude who once had 3 passives. Bizarro."
DotA2,ff8g45g,t1_ff7e6wz,1579676960.0,"I like the concept! I was thinking about the ethereal state the other day, and I wanted more heroes to be able to become ethereal, maybe be perma ghost, would be busted at lvl 1 rune fights tho. Ooze state however sounds cool

I will say, however, is that it's exhausting that most new heroes and hero reworks have mobility and lots of mobility at that. Stuff like puck getting a free blink, Sven getting an initiation, abyssal is now a blink, void spirit having his bs, cookie on snapfire, slark getting an increase to leap range with aghs, and the list could really go on and on. So having q being a hookshot + nuke + slow, a passive phase, and an invulnerability just feels so derivative of the current meta"

Trump called Iraq to setup a summit between Iran, Iraq, USA, Saudi Arabia. Iraq contacts Iran, Iran sends soleimani to Saudi, he goes and meets folk, goes to Iraq, meets there, gets bombed by us in bagdad. That's directly against the Geneva conference. This is a war crime.

Mike pence lied about 911 yesterday to retroactively claim that what they did was in American best interest. 


Donald trump is now proving to the world that the United States can go anywhere and do anything and kill whoever it wants regardless of international law, regardless of whoever has to die.

He used drones to murder their leaders. Imagine if the tables were turned. Imagine if Iran assassinated the joint chief of staffs and was in a position to get away with it. We would hate Iran and would be justified. War crimes and ethoncide is not justified.
