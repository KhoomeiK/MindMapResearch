BlackPeopleTwitter,few9dls,t1_few0fim,1579407102.0,"That’s a stretch, but I do agree with the sentiment. Granted, I’m really methodical and slow in the kitchen, but to prep meals for an entire week would easily take me twice (or maybe three times) that long. It’s still doable. I think one issue is people are too picky. Now, if food is their one pleasure in life, I can see the argument, but there’s a lot of people who are just annoying about it. Food doesn’t have to be your favorite thing every time you eat it. God forbid you have to eat leftovers!"
