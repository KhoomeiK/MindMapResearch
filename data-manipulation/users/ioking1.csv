I doubt this is actually worth any more than a cent, it seems to be in rough condition so there is the possibility that the text was just worn off, it is a fairly old penny. If it is a misprint, that could mean that there are others that were produced at the same time as this one that have the same defect, which means that if it is something rare or collectible then there is probably something out there about it. As far as I could tell there is nobody looking for this specifically, but who knows, maybe somebody would be willing to pay for it because it's different?"
