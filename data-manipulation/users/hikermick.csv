The first thing I noticed about factories is that they start to lock the tool cage. Usually an area sectioned off with a chain link fence. Once things start going downhill, employees start pilfering. Property management companies will ignore problems in apartment buildings most people don't see but they'll sink lots of money into the lobby and hallways because they are about to try to sell the property."

The guy was a little too anxious to pick me up so my Spidey senses are tingling. This happened in the late 80's and he was driving one of those vans from the 70's when it was a fad to trick em out and put a bed in the back. I climbed into the passenger seat and noticed the television set lying on the floor between the seats on it's back with the screen facing up. He asks me if I like movies, I tell him yeah and he reaches down and turns the TV on. There is a Marilyn Chambers movie running already. He had a VCR under his seat playing the porno while driving around and must have switched the TV off only when he picked me up. Like an idiot I say ""Hey I've seen this one!"" which was true but not a bright idea. It doesn't take long before he's offering to pull over and give me head and I declined. He didn't try to talk me into it but went on to tell me stories about other guys before pulling over to drop me off. Stuff like that happened a lot while hitchhiking be he was the most bizarre."
