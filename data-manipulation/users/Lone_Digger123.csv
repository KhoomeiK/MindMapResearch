Left school not going to uni because i don't know what the fuck to do. Didn't get a job in my first year out of school and have no personality apart from a 3 month job which I quit.

Now I need a job, but I'm one of those person who doesn't portray themselves well and have no experience meaning any job I like I get rejected on and now just got a job as a checkout assistant.

Now looking around at all my friends and school mates, they all have jobs, travelling and doing well at uni. Not only that but everyone seemingly has their sorted and does stuff and has a passion etc. Whereas I've just rotted away for 3-4 years depressed just staying in my room."

Cricket,ff1l208,t1_fezusii,1579480906.0,The only thing that stops me from saying that he will meet AB's performances is his age.
Cricket,ff1kxu9,t1_fezrz9g,1579480851.0,"Sure his combination of strike rate and average is great in ODI, but if we look at their statistics for odi's:

Buttler: http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/308967.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting 

AB De Villiers: http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/44936.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting

- Buttler has batted in 117 ODI matches whereas AB has batted in 218 innings (which is nearly DOUBLE so had a way larger sample size and had to be consistent for LONGER).

- Buttler has an ODI average of 40.88 and AB has an ODI average of 53.50 (which is 10 more runs over a longer career).

- Buttler has 9 100's and 20 50's which is great but then AB is world class - he has **25** 100's and **53** 50's. That is over double for both 50's and 100's. 

- Now let's look at home and away performances because I can. Buttler has an average of 47.61 at home and 31.97 away whereas AB... wait for it... has 52.55 at home and *61.75* AWAY!!

*""Oh but Lone_Digger123 he's played for longer!! That isn't fair!!!!!""* I hear you say? Ok. Let's compare the average's between the two from Buttler's debut year (2012) until now (keep in mind AB retired early 2018 and Buttler is still playing).

Buttler: 117 innings batted. AB: 103 innings batted. Just to show they have similar innings.

Buttler average: 40.88. AB average from 2012-2018: **61.90**!! (AB only dipped below 40.88 average in 2018, his final year, where he only played 3 matches before retiring).

Their 50's and 100's during this time: 
Buttler: 9 100's and 20 50's. AB: 14 100's and 27 50's.

So despite having batted in less innings whilst Buttler has been playing ODI's for England, AB still has a higher average, more 50's and more 100's. Also Buttler played all of 2018 and 2019 whereas AB only played 3 matches in 2018.

For me I think it's pretty convincing that a player similar to AB will never be seen and it certainly isn't Buttler (if he was 25-ish it could've been possible but he's 29 now). Despite these facts I still very much like Buttler as a player and he's actually my favourite English player along with Roy."

This guy reacted and started attacking him personally, how he is an idiot etc. etc. without any reasoning (and even said to not get angry and be a stupid fucking idiot which was very hypocritical).

You seem like you know your shit and have a good path for life right now. Now who gives a shit if people are getting angry at you on social media.
