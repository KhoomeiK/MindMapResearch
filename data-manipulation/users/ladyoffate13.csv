Shit, that was a weird read...."
AskReddit,ff1os95,t3_eqztla,1579482842.0,"My first time with a game character falling into “the infinite abyss.” I was playing the first Tomb Raider (2013 version, not the *first* first) and there came a scene after a battle where that was supposed to get triggered when I was in the right spot; it never got triggered, so I wandered a bit around the battlefield confused. I know I was supposed to eventually climb through an open window, but the window was completely black and showed nothing on the other side. Fed up, I climbed through it anyway...and watched in horror as Lara tumbled through the infinite blue abyss. She just fell and continued to fall onscreen. The game wouldn’t even pause, so I was forced to do a hard reset on the PS. Luckily the game saved before the battle, so it wasn’t a total loss, but I pretty shook up about what I just witnessed."
