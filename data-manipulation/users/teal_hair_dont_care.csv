WhitePeopleTwitter,ffc5e9p,t1_ffbqnl7,1579791927.0,My brother is 6 and when I asked him how old I am he told me 30. I’m 22. I asked him how old our parents are and he said 37. The crazy thing is I remember being the same way and thinking everyone above the age of like 15 was just a grown up.

rickandmorty,ff6qwkw,t1_ff5nqe3,1579633004.0,Something about him screams “weird kid who got bullied and is now mean to other kids” and I can’t stand it. The whole kid portion of that cast seem kinda pretentious to me ngl
conspiracy,ff6nzfc,t1_ff6mi8z,1579631256.0,3. FUCKING.  MILLION. I wish I could say fuck it to my family line and still get 3 mill out of it and have people say I’m “breaking free” and “making my own living”
AskReddit,ff5vij0,t1_ff4hlbh,1579611680.0,"One time I dropped an Orange Julius in a shoe store and tried to play it off like I drank most of it and was finished when I went to throw it out. Of course my Dad went down that aisle next, saw me, minus an Orange Julius, and deduced what had happened. I came clean and apologized to my dad and he made me go up to the cashier and explain what I did and ask if they had any paper towels so I could clean it up. 

I was MORTIFIED but the cashier was so grateful I told her instead of just leaving it for them to find and clean up themselves later. It was definitely a teaching moment for me and since then I am extremely cautious when I go to stores."

I remember staying after school almost every day in high school because I couldn’t stand being home.
wholesomememes,ff5puho,t1_ff5lf49,1579605251.0,I’m in this exact situation. My brother is only 6 but I know if I leave I probably won’t see much of him or him at all and it breaks my heart to think of him asking my parents where I am and them telling him some bullshit. He’s my little dude and I gotta protect him so they don’t treat him like they do me.
madlads,ff5mjgp,t3_erp094,1579600324.0,Everyone saying this is fake; its not. It’s an ad for [this](https://www.ihatestevensinger.com/why-hate-steven/ssj-contentpage-history.html?lang=en_US)  jewelry company.

You can’t just send a person who can’t even speak the same language as them to take care of them, it puts both parties at risk. If your mother had dementia would you rather some 19 year old schlub to take care of her of a highly trained nurse who has the skillset to manager her medicine, mood, and delusions ?"

HumansBeingBros,fezsa0d,t1_fezq8cv,1579460999.0,"Me too when I went away for school I always hated it when random people would try to sit with me because I was alone. I had a roommate and classes and was in a sorority I cherished my alone time and needed a break from everyone. Some random group of people who I don’t know would be such a bummer to me, especially bc I’m awkward asf and wouldn’t tell them to go away."

I was bullied growing up and am so scared that he is in a similar situation but thankfully it seems that times have changed at least a little the past few years and high school aged kids are becoming somewhat nicer. 

I hope she is happy and finds her people. Make sure she knows that high school friends are largely superficial and it seems really important now but in 5 years high school will be a distant memory to her."
HumansBeingBros,fezr35h,t1_fez1naa,1579460583.0,"Yup. Be yourself, the other girls dont like you because youre pretty and they’re jealous, the boys are just mean because they like you.

newjersey,feza69r,t1_feuceyl,1579455249.0,THIS^^ I never give the finger or make eye contact just yell to myself in my car like a crazy person. A couple months ago some dbag passed me on a double yellow and was driving like an ass and my sweet sweet italian grandmother decided to really lay into him with the cursing and hand movements and this man really held a baseball bat out his window and popped a U-Turn we were like 20 minutes late to wherever we were going because I had to drive down random roads to make sure he wasn’t following me.

agedlikemilk,fed9a0n,t1_feckbup,1579004448.0,"I’m 22, my first phone was a literal flip phone (and no it wasn’t a hand me down). Yeah I had a PS2 but I also had a PS1 and a Game Boy. I used to use Ask Jeeves and even used Aim and MySpace. When I was in middle school we still used projectors on rolly carts with the clear sheets to put things on the board and by the time I was a senior I had class rooms with Macs and online text books and Smart Boards. I think you’re greatly underestimating just how much has changed so quickly.

I even posted on and followed r The_Donald. When people would make negative comments about my group affiliation it just fed into my Us vs. Them mentality and made me more cemented in my views and made me turn more to the Republican group I joined. 

I moved away from that school and faced the real world and was able to learn how fucked those beliefs I held were and was able to grow and change as a person.
