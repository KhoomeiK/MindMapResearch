Abernathy-Wicked Shipping-Sunshine-Raiders under Walden Farm, then back to Sanctuary to drop off loot. As the Walden pond gift shop has a camera I will usually set up recruitment pylon. Then Out of Sanctuary, taking a sharp left. Water Pump-Robot Disposal place (pick up fusion core)-Power Armor near downed vertibird - Satellite Station Olivia for Abernathy quest-Back to Sanctuary to drop off loot. 

Will usually be about level 5, full suit of leather and a couple of decent weapons."
