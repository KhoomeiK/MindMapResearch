How did you like the museum?"
Awwducational,fcw0brc,t1_fcvuv21,1578014203.0,"To me, the interesting part about that is how much effort the mother will go to in order to protect her nest from the male Komodo Dragons which try to eat the eggs.  Even going so far as to create “fake” decoy nests. 

I find it so odd that they go through so much trouble protecting the eggs, only to try and eat their young the moment they hatch."
Watches,fculo1m,t1_fcu04dh,1577983718.0,Soldering iron is a great idea — I was going to try and heat up a nail or something metal with my lighter and cauterize it and somehow never considered  just using a soldering iron!! Cheers
Awwducational,fculfaf,t1_fcu53ci,1577983576.0,They are such fascinating creatures. I’ve really enjoyed learning about them
Watches,fctq7ua,t3_eivn4e,1577953888.0,"I’ve been seeing a few posts lately on r/watches with the Casio Royale and couldn’t resist getting one for myself.

For the $30 price tag, I am very impressed with this timepiece.

I have adjusted the stock metal bracelet to fit my wrist for the time being, but very much look forward to my brown leather strap arriving in the mail.

I ordered a light brown 24mm Ostrich Leather strap off of Etsy, which I will have to notch out at the top to fit the Casio which is supposed to fit an 18mm strap. As I have seen in some other posts, the 18mm strap seems just a tad thin, and the wider strap really suits the lines of this watch.

I considered a NATO strap, and might see about popping one on in the future.

Highly recommend picking up this fun little unit to
anyone who is bouncing around the idea"

When I snapped these photos, the young Komodo Dragon had just climbed down off a tree trunk and was moving along the ground"

Watches,fcto298,t3_eiv9by,1577950949.0,I’ve seen a few of these $30 Royales popping up on this sub and just had to get one. Currently have a brown leather strap in the mail which I’m excited to pop on here

For editing I did everything on Adobe Premiere. I think that After Effects might have been a better choice for some of the stabilization though. I didn’t find Warp Stabilizer super helpful"
