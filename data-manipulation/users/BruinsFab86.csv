I started a kids channel for my two boys 10 weeks ago and have been uploading a video a week since. We do Challenges,  STEM activities and some acting skits. As of 2 and a half months ago I had zero filmmaking / editing experience so please go easy haha. But i have been spending all my free time researching and learning the craft, and can definitely see an improvement every week.

For a little reference, I am colorblind, so started experimenting with LUTs, but will get help from the wife going forward. This is also my first video with a gimbal, so learning the proper panning/moving techniques will take time.


Thanks again !

SmallYTChannel,fe4ewow,t1_fe4aycs,1578858553.0,"Wow thank you for the in depth response!

- I do own a couple tripods. This video was my first video I shot with a gimbal I just got, so that would explain the drifting. All my previous videos were shot with a tripod. But damn, gimbals are difficult to use!

-colors.  I am color blind haha. Literally.  So up to this point I have done no color correction,  and just used some premade cinematic LUTs I found online. I know I will always be at a disadvantage due to my colorblindness,  and was thinking of trying to get the wife to spend a few weeks learning proper color correction so she can help with that aspect.

-cuts. I fully agree. I had ""2 minutes"" in my head from the start and ended up pulling cuts longer than normal to make that time. Almost like in grade school when you are just throwing random adjectives in to get to the word count.

I cant describe how thankful I am for you to take the time to critique the video so well. I will take everything you said and apply it going forward. Thank you!

SmallYTChannel,fdqqt2y,t3_emq43g,1578672895.0,"I only managed to get through the first half before I had to get back to the office, but I have some thoughts anyways. Your charisma and relatability to people is really nice and you seem so genuine that I look forward to going through and watching more of your videos later. Good video and audio levels as well. My only critique through the first 7-8 minutes is it took you so long to get into what the title of the video was about that I was confused. At first I thought the video WAS the culmination of a video every day, then it  wasn't, but you didnt explain that until over 4 minutes in. But that is just me being nitpicky. Great job !"
SmallYTChannel,fdqps74,t3_emqgqb,1578672257.0,"Man that was really good. Colour grading,  film style was all great. Critiques would be to get the Audio levels up and get a gimbal for the camera, was a tad too shaky for me."

You are very good at editing and ambiance and very nice voice, but maybe trying to outline the video to capture the audience in the first minute or so would make it better !"

She has both teams schedules imported into her calendar every year and does not make plans that involve me while either team play. Vikings and Bruins are my passion, my hobby, and that's just the way it is!

Good job and you seem very comfortable in front of the camera. Some slight criticisms from me would be certain transitions you used (hand over the camera) that transitioned to the exact same shot just didnt work for me. We use that trick as well, but it's to cut to a different scene. Also, maybe introducing each step as you discuss it rather than the whole list that I had to pause to read through. Doing it that way would build more suspense into the next sub topic. But good job regardless! Thumbs up!"

My dad worked hard, but in terms of my milestones and life events, was not there much besides sports. 

He sees me, who has never missed a doctor's appointment,  a haircut, a first or last day of school, a class trip, etc. For either of my children and it put things in perspective for him.

I assured him that we are all a product of our surroundings and the majority of dads were how he was when I was growing up. And that he was more involved with me than his dad was with him and so on. I think as parents our goal SHOULD be to improve on things.
