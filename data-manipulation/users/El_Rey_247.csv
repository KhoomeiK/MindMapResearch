Drone-striker-in-chief, with his hyper-efficient deportation of illegal immigrants, and the continuation of the War on Terror. Kept up Guantanamo Bay, and the embargo on Cuba. Stayed ""neutral"" in a number of environmental and human rights issues, such as the Dakota Pipeline Protests. Did a huge amount of ""legislating"" via executive order. That guy, that Obama. Not far right enough.

Honestly, the best thing you can say to criticize him truly from the right - in a way that makes sense and appeals to the left - is that his administration expanded government surveillance to the point where digital privacy seems practically non-existent. Personal privacy is typically a right-wing talking point, and one which resonates with mixed audiences. If only it weren't in direct conflict with priority on maintaining a ""free market"", since many internet providers are private companies which stand to benefit from collecting and selling information freely.

While cartoony racers like Mario Kart more or less appeal to everyone, newer ""arcade"" racers like need for speed have a lot of... gaminess (for lack of a better word). Neither forgiving like a cartoon racer, nor realistic.

Consider trying out a racing sim like Grid, Forza, or Project Cars. Stay away from Dirt, though; holy crap, that one has the harshest learning curve, and no in-game tutorial.

If you feel like getting serious, you need a force feedback wheel and pedals. They're not *too* expensive. You can buy a decent set for $200-$400 on Ebay. (Just gotta check game compatibility first. Each wheel only has native support in some games.)

Sometimes the wheel can be the barrier to entry, though. A few years ago, some friends and I pooled money to buy a mutual friend the best wheel and pedals for his games, even a gear shifter. 

Naturally, though, we tried it out before giving it to him. Set it up in the living room in front of the TV, and took turns. My mom - who can barely play any video game - gave it a try, and absolutely loved the experience. My dad too, whose experience is mostly just Mario Kart."

FragileWhiteRedditor,ff4iilu,t1_ff49up1,1579564433.0,"You can simplify this response - this philosophy - to a simple, easy-to-understand phrase: You can be responsible without being at fault. 

If you're working a job, and the previous shift breaks something and can't fix it before they leave, then it falls to you. You didn't break it - you aren't at fault - but it's absolutely your responsibility to try to fix things during your shift. 

The firefighter didn't start the blaze, but is responsible for putting it out. The doctor didn't cause the patient to become sick, but is responsible for curing the patient. The detective didn't commit the crime, but is responsible for trying to solve it.

You could argue that you're getting paid to do that, so it's different. Really, that's a question of responsibility. You can be responsible for something without getting paid, such as being a parent and being responsible for the well-being of your children. 

No matter which direction you take, you're going to hit the wall of caring for other people.

vaxxhappened,fev0f0l,t1_fetlnch,1579391768.0,"Terrain theory is the idea that diseases are attracted to people who provide the right ""terrain"" for them to flourish. It makes sense from a very shallow macroscopic analysis. Make sure there's no dirt or grim on your hands before you eat, shower regularly, keep your house clean... Keep your ""terrain"" (body and surroundings) clean, and you won't get sick because diseases aren't attracted to you.

As a scientific theory, however, it has been completely debunked. You'd have to be crazy, dishonest, or scientifically illiterate to still be spreading terrain theory. We now know that humans have really complex ecosystems on and within them. Your [skin flora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_flora), [oral flora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_microbiology#Role_in_Health), and [gut flora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_microbiota), for example, are important parts of keeping your healthy. I've heard dentists actually recommend against mouthwashes like Listerine because they kill the ""good"" bacteria along with the bad, making the mouth flora unstable and potentially leading to worse overall health.

So, you'd probably be worse off in the completely clear bowl - your body and surroundings completely free of microorganisms - than you would be currently.

It isn't *technically* a black market, if I remember correctly.

It'd be a grey market, not a black market. Then again, you buy a ""homemade"" firearm, and no one can prove you didn't make it yourself.

It's worth stating that that statistic can be misleading, though. Maybe 60% of guns seized are unregistered, but what percentage of total guns are actually seized? There might be a correlation between the type of person that wouldn't want to go through official channels to get a gun, and the type of person that would attract attention to have their guns seized.

From [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender):
> Gender—or the different characteristics that begin to define a person as masculine or feminine—consists of several categories apart from the traditional binary ends of the male/female spectrum.

In other words, a man *is* defined as being male-like, and a woman *is* defined as being female-like, at least for American culture.

And from an [Intro to Sociology textbook](https://opentextbc.ca/introductiontosociology/chapter/chapter12-gender-sex-and-sexuality/)

> Gender is a term that refers to social or cultural distinctions associated with being male or female. Gender identity is the extent to which one identifies as being either masculine or feminine (Diamond 2002).

> ...

> Characteristics of gender, [as opposed to sex], may vary greatly between different societies. For example, in American culture, it is considered feminine (or a trait of the female gender) to wear a dress or skirt. However, in many Middle Eastern, Asian, and African cultures, dresses or skirts (often referred to as sarongs, robes, or gowns) can be considered masculine. The kilt worn by a Scottish male does not make him appear feminine in his culture.

> ...

> The dichotomous view of gender (the notion that one is either male or female) is specific to certain cultures and is not universal. In some cultures, gender is viewed as fluid. In the past, some anthropologists used the term berdache to refer to individuals who occasionally or permanently dressed and lived as the opposite gender. The practice has been noted among certain Aboriginal groups  (Jacobs, Thomas, and Lang 1997). Samoan culture accepts what they refer to as a “third gender.” Fa’afafine, which translates as “the way of the woman,” is a term used to describe individuals who are born biologically male but embody both masculine and feminine traits. Fa’afafines are considered an important part of Samoan culture.

Basically, there are certain social expectations of what it means to belong to a certain gender. Current western gender norms are somewhat strictly defined by physical sex. Phrases like ""man up"" and ""not very ladylike"" demonstrate that. ""Boys will be boys."" ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus.""

Again from [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/gender-dysphoria)

> Gender dysphoria (formerly known as gender identity disorder in the fourth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM) is defined by strong, persistent feelings of identification with another gender and discomfort with one's own assigned gender and sex; in order to qualify for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, these feelings must cause significant distress or impairment. People with gender dysphoria often desire to live in accordance with their gender identity and may dress and use mannerisms associated with the gender with which they identify in order to achieve this goal.

If terms like ""assigned gender"" and ""gender identity"" confuse you, I'll break it down a little.

First, people are people. When you have a survey, and the age ranges are broken up as 18-34, 35-49, 50+, that doesn't mean that there's a big difference between the age 34 and the age 35 people. It's just that there is some kind of division at an arbitrary point. It gets blurrier around the edges, but it's enough to identify a single group.

Those groups are like genders. It's a category like ""man"" or ""woman"" that is somewhat broad, and the differences get blurry at the edges.

Gender identity is a person's own sense of gender, and it's really a continuous spectrum. Same with age. You're not *really* 30 years old, you're 30 years and 5 months and 8 days and 3 hours... but 30 years is the appropriate category for you. You might not be exactly ""woman"" in the same way that you might not be exactly 30 years old, but it might be the appropriate category for you, so you identify as a woman.

Assigned gender is the gender that is assumed for you when you are too young to make a decision. Typically, it's assigned at birth and based on physical sex. If you are male, you are raised as a boy; if female, a girl. When the distress from trying to meet gender standards you aren't comfortable with is so great, and you have a strong sense of being more comfortable with the standards of another gender, that is gender dysphoria as described above.

The term ""transgender"" doesn't exclusively refer to being a female identifying as a ""man"" or a male identifying as a ""woman"". Instead, it's just an umbrella term for any person whose gender identity and how they express that identity doesn't match that person's assigned gender. 

To use the age analogy again, imagine you were taking that same survey, except the categories are only 18-34 and 50+. You, in your 40s, can't really say you belong to either category. The same way, if your gender identity doesn't fall into either ""man"" or ""woman"", you may identify yourself as ""non-binary"" or ""third gender"". You might reject the categories of gender entirely. All of that would fall under the umbrella of ""transgender""."

The community could be more welcoming, or maybe point to the Legends universe with a ""if you liked *that*, you'll probably like *this* too/more."" I've personally seen very little of that. Lots of people saying negatively about things in the Legends universe that they wished would have been incorporated, or otherwise just sharing Legends series that they liked, but not much direction from the sequel trilogy to other Star Wars media.

For example, something like ""If you liked Kylo Ren / Ben Solo and you want to see a sith being redeemed by love, you should check out *The Force Unleashed* video game"".

I don't think ""debunked"" is the right word. Warren claimed to be Native American, and that she grew up hearing that she was Native American. Because people were constantly making fun of that and accusing her of lying, she had a DNA test. I think she had some negligible amount of DNA which matched Native American markers, but fewer than most people would typically consider ""related"".

Not that it really matters. A Native American (I want to say Cherokee) leader came out and said that they don't really care about DNA, but culture and heritage. If she grew up believing she was Native American, then they wouldn't take that from her, but the fact that she believed a DNA test counted for anything and she actually went through with it... that was insulting and disrespectful to the culture, and demonstrated that she was an ignorant outsider.

So... not really debunked, but moot. She turned out to not be Native American in any meaningful way, but it wasn't really held against her for believing it if she grew up hearing that as part of her family narrative. However, even believing it, her actions show that she didn't research to try to meaningfully connect with that part of her perceived heritage."

The difference, the real difference, is that - with the exception of the rare extremes you see on /r/TumblrInAction - racism against white people usually isn't humanity-denying. Oh sure, white guys can't jump, but they're still people. The stereotypes aren't that they are inherently dumber, or inherently likely to father and then abandon children, or inherently likely to be a thief. Even the really negative stereotypes, like being inbred, are qualified as being white *trash*, or rednecks, or some other group that doesn't include all white people.

And, of course, in white majority countries - and in many white minority countries - white people don't have to deal with the same systemic racism. If nothing else, popular media (e.g. blockbuster movies) still normalize the portrayal of white people internationally."

worldpolitics,feg7b02,t1_feg6ug4,1579080394.0,"That's a lot of unnecessary steps for a simple definition. Obviously your personal beliefs don't exist in isolation, and can be defined externally. But for a simple definition, saying ""A moral is a belief you hold about right and wrong"" is a good enough place to start. This started out from a person who claimed to be otherwise ignorant, and whose only context was a D&D alignment chart. I think it's a fantastic starting point.

As for ethics in that definition, the key is that they are not morals, but moral *principles* (""moral"" being used as an adjective) which specifically ""govern"" (i.e. rule) what a person does. They're rules, not abstract beliefs as morals can be.

Edit: I concede there's a grey area, but there's a clear distinction in framing. For example, you can say you have the moral that stealing is wrong. Fair enough. However, you can probably dig a little deeper and say you have the moral that people should be secure in their personal property, and from that stems the ethic that stealing is wrong. The ethic is the actual rule that controls action, while the moral can be an abstract belief about right and wrong. I've also heard ethics described as ""applied morals""."
worldpolitics,feg698n,t1_feg5vdo,1579078914.0,"You could try looking up the definition of ethics. Yes, one definition is a branch of philosophy, but the other (which Google lists first, incidentally)

Likewise, the relevant definition for moral (though not listed first)

You might be interested in looking into Fowler's [Stages of Faith Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_W._Fowler). Although he's given them age ranges, the truth is that there are lots of people that never move on from one stage to the next.

It's not just about religion. You can apply the model to worldviews in general, growing up believing in X political parties or causes or scientific ""truths"". You didn't understand what your parents were talking about (as a child) but you played along. Your parents did it so it was ""normal"", maybe even the ""right"" thing to do. Then you grow up, and you start learning to consider other points of view, and maybe you like some of them buy they conflict with your previous one, so you drop a belief you had from your parents. You might eventually come up with beliefs that you believe can be maintained universally, and you can actually stick to them without caveat.

Almost no one makes it to the end, and - frankly - Fowler overall was an optimist when it came to the age ranges.

Beyond that - and while I'm sure there are more legitimate psychological sources for this - [this video](https://youtu.be/TB_3LF7uoNc?t=119) on writing redemption arcs helped me process discomfort and cognitive dissonance. In particular, the concept of the trifecta of personal stakes, worldview, and view of self. I think it's actually a very good way to frame internal conflict and change, especially since it can happen one piece at a time, but the pieces do have to be in sync."
