scifi,ffqocwp,t1_ffqnv42,1580139832.0,"It depends on the storylines you read. For instance Judge Dredd: Apocalypse War gets into the apocalypse, as well as a few others. Where as the Mega City One storylines feel more dystopian. Judge Dredd's biggest theme is that they're living in and through the apocalypse, not that the apocalypse was just a singular event.

Nowadays, it's just something people say about him to grab attention, which is what this person was doing."

FallenOrder,ffl70we,t3_etx7rw,1580035704.0,"When I saw the trailer, I thought the same thing like ""oh cool another white male how neat..."" but the performance he gave, and how good the motion capture was more than erased my doubt. Looking at this character as just a race and a gender is wrong. Should Star Wars have more diverse leads? Yes. Does Star Wars now have more diverse leads and supporting casts? imo yes 100%. If we're going to just make this about ""anybody but white man"" then let's do it.

Star Wars: The Clone Wars - all the Clone Troopers, Asaaj Ventress, Padme

Star Wars: Rebels -Ezra, and everyone else except his master Kanan

Star Wars Sequel Trilogy - Rey, Fin, Poe (heard people assume he's white, and he's not, Oscar Isaac is from Guatemala), Leia, Rose

Jedi: Fallen Order - Merrin, Cere, Trilla (the best Star Wars villain since Darth Vader imo), Ninth Sister, Saw Gerrera

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - Jyn, Cassian, Bodhi, Chirrut, Baze, Saw Gerrera (again)

The Mandalorian - the Mandalorian, the mercenary, the primary villain, the guild master

Star Wars has been A+'ing representation since the Lucasfilm buyout and we should be celebrating it. Sorry it's not perfect but like, complaining about every white male protagonist you see in popular media isn't cool, or changing anything. In my opinion, the best actor won the role of Cal Kestis, and he happened to be a white man. That's not an inherently bad thing. Seriously, Cameron Monaghan did a brilliant job, and perfectly portrayed what Cal's character was. We should be praising his work, not tearing him down for being something he can't change."
