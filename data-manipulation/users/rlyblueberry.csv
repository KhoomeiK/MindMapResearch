MRU,ffhomcj,t3_eton59,1579945619.0,Just a wild guess but could it be related to the recent coronavirus outbreak? Although it does seem a bit too early for public places closing down.
PS4Deals,ffg9y9r,t1_ffc1g3k,1579901637.0,"I’ve heard a lot of good things about Dead Cells and the gameplay seems very interesting. Keeping an eye on it myself.

Sayonara Wild Hearts is really good too, although relatively short. You can try to get the achievements to make it longer. It’s pretty innovative though."

You and your ayatollahs will be punished, and history will remember you as the most cowardly and the most haroom zadeh traitors. You will go down in history. One day your brainwashed monkeys will no longer sustain to supper the evil you have done. Shayateen."
worldnews,fdyo8oi,t1_fdynclx,1578781872.0,I’m more real than your ayatollah’s religion. So shut the fuck up.
worldnews,fdyhr0p,t1_fdyg5sw,1578779937.0,"I don’t even get what you’re trying to say. Here’s a summery to make you understand wtf I’m trying to clarify for you:

1. I say: we are oppressed in Iran

2. Dude says: “how’s LA and Toronto?” To discredit my opinion about what goes on in Iran.

3. I say: just because I don’t live in Iran atm doesn’t mean I don’t understand shit about my country.

And how did I ever assume the other comments are not Iranians? What the actual fuck are you on about?!!"
worldnews,fdygna1,t1_fdyfif6,1578779580.0,"Dude. You’re a lost cause. Dear “Cyberi”, claiming  that “a year of watching the news in the West” has lead me to understand the oppression in Iran and the genocide that khamanie has started in my country, is just proving that Iran’s propaganda is so strong that any reasonable person outside of Iran can see the shit hole you and your likes have turned the country into. So typical of your kind to be so stupid."
worldnews,fdyfufj,t1_fdyf5ff,1578779353.0,"And I never stated that I’m currently living in Iran atm. When did I claim such a thing? The reason that yeetus dude brought up LA and Toronto is because of a backwards mindset that “those outside of Iran don’t matter because they’ve betrayed their country”. This type of radical thinking is fundamentally wrong. He also tried to discredit the stifling of freedom that occurs in Iran by bringing up completely irrelevant points into the conversation. Was I born, grown, and educated in Iran for 24 years? Yeah. Does that mean I cannot give insight to the situation in Iran? Not at all."
