unpopularopinion,ffrontv,t3_euocl7,1580162422.0,"I was a bit of a snarky asshole in high school (I'm still pretty smug, but I'm better than I used to be). I ran into a guy I went to school with at a bar a few years ago, and asked him if I was ever a douche to him back in the day. He kind of laughed and said a little, so I bought the next round and apologized. We've met up at a couple festivals since and are always cool when we see each other out. I always send drinks his way when I see him out and he does the same. Felt good to do the right thing and admit to myself that I'm not always the good guy like people tend to think. We are different people to everyone in our lives."

relationship_advice,ffng8bo,t3_eu5gfv,1580065517.0,"Personally, when I start getting jealous (which is not often) I usually end a relationship. Not at the drop of a hat, of course. I feel like once I start to doubt the person I'm with, that either means that I'm not in a good head space to be in a relationship, OR my hunch is correct, and it's time to reconsider being with the person at all. Obviously, you should start by communicating your concerns in most situations, but sometimes the best move is to move on. I'm 29, and I still make dumb decisions all the time when it comes to dating, but one good lesson I've learned is not to hold onto a toxic situation just because you're attracted to someone."

If nobody is in danger (besides your own pride), you should do everything you can to de-escelate a situation. Obviously, you should protect your friends and family, or stand up for weaker folks who might be getting picked on, but you did the right thing. You never know how far a fight could escalate, and you could end up being the one in prison even if it wasn't your fault. Sounds extreme, but getting in fights after high school is a terrible idea if you can avoid it."
