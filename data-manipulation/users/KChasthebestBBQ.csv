I watched the whole thing through KCTV5 (with views from a helicopter the entire rally) and the amount of people was exactly like the picture on the top. As a Chiefs fan I hate seeing people lie about stuff like this. 

Who cares if a rally on a cold day didn’t have as many people as expected. Its still a ton of people in attendance and it’s something we should be proud of! Its better to be proud that we had as many people show up as we did than to blow it out of proportion and feel ashamed when we get called out for posting photoshopped photos to look better. Hopefully others feel the sane way as me with this. Honesty is the best policy and it’s still something to be proud of."

Homebrewing,feyol72,t3_eqwsm2,1579448360.0,To make your project easier - with a hydrometer ($10) you could record the sugar density in your mixture before fermentation takes place and periodically throughout the week. There will be a noticeable drop in sugar density after one week and you can explain the process of how yeast turns sugar into alcohol and so on.

kansas,fegybfi,t1_fegrw1u,1579105237.0,It’s no more than a rumor. Other rumors include the government spying on us and aliens. Take everything with a grain of salt lol
kansas,fefp3m9,t3_eorcp9,1579061292.0,I wonder if this could be related to the drones out in western Kansas and eastern Colorado. Rumor has it that they could possibly be looking for a missing warhead.
