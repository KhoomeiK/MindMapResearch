aww,ffpl6o7,t1_ffox1uk,1580097763.0,I think i might name my next dog that.
Athens,ffnitdh,t1_ffk4gxf,1580066467.0,"Oh I know our police for is abysmal. Even if we had more, it wouldn't change things. Having more police isn't going to lower crime significantly."
Athens,ffjdndp,t1_ffh9shn,1579996071.0,"Because it's not going to change anything. Athens has a crime problem, it's WHY you hear of people's guns being stolen each week. It's not like this in places with actual police that get out of their cars."
Athens,ffe8d5k,t1_ffe4pag,1579839481.0,"That's not a lot.

Edit: It still isn't a lot. 8 assault rifles doesn't mean anything. Nobody is safer because EIGHT were recovered. Gun stores sell that many in an afternoon."
AskReddit,ffcevhy,t3_esr647,1579797962.0,"Working on my project truck. I've figured out a lot of stuff with relative ease and nothing has gone wrong that wasn't a simple fix. But after 3 years, I'm just tired of working on it."
Athens,ffcaxwl,t1_ffc8bo5,1579795506.0,Thanks! I'd love to know more locations but even knowing one is great.
Athens,ffb84p2,t1_ffb1fi5,1579754607.0,"Out of curiosity, how are you setting up the garage? Are you providing tools, how are you keeping track of garage supplies?"
funny,ff766wc,t1_ff6ucfe,1579641909.0,"Tom definitely has shows giving him some height. But he’s srill not equal to Brad. I’d say he’s boosting his height at least 1.5”, if not more."
funny,ff75xu6,t3_erw4ce,1579641770.0,"Protest and rally? Okay.
Do it while armed? ...okay?
Do it while armed with an AR15, with a tactical vest and helmet? No. That’s being ready for an event to happen. Fuck outta here."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff753yg,t3_erydlq,1579641302.0,Welcome to the club. You’ll be hooked for the rest of your life.
AskReddit,ff0b8na,t3_equ586,1579467136.0,Drive to Atlanta and buy car dealerships out of their stock.
Athens,ff07wt4,t3_eqt84r,1579466171.0,Stoned? Or just Athens townies in general?
funny,fepmvvb,t3_eq2mzv,1579324751.0,Sometimes you have to trim your bush to see your penis.
CFB,fel5ort,t1_fel5jiq,1579214607.0,lets get the otter that's in the pond
Athens,fekrwko,t1_fekdkp9,1579206334.0,r/athens is super finicky. They either love you or hate you lol but thanks!
CFB,fekp6fu,t1_fejy9dp,1579204723.0,Nope. VT stays a 8-5 team and never wins the ACC while Dabo is still in it. He's failing at recruiting as well. He can't recruit VA anymore so he's going out of state for prospects. Hence the whole NC2VT and TX2VT thing they're trying to get going.
CFB,fekp25n,t1_fejys5t,1579204652.0,We all said that prior to this season and nothing happened. How many more chances does he get?
CFB,fekoyp2,t3_epkqhy,1579204595.0,"I wouldn't have minded if he left and took Cornelsen with him.

But all this talk of ""unfinished business"" all the coaches are suddenly tweeting about is nothing but white noise. Unless serious changes or gains are made on offense, this is another 8-5/7-6 team that loses to Penn State, doesn't made the ACC Championship, and loses the bowl game. All things any coach with this roster can do."
todayilearned,fekon12,t3_epdbvn,1579204406.0,Does it have to be a ventilator or would one of those squeeze things you see on tv in a ambulance work?
Athens,fejz9db,t3_epkqfh,1579189215.0,"We know you're going to put soap in it.

Just make sure it's a biodegradable type."
sports,fefl9xb,t3_eooo61,1579058733.0,"Lower the rims so they can dunk and see what happens.

I promise, it won't affect viewership negatively."
Athens,fdyf8bf,t1_fdwbig6,1578779089.0,"I don't know why you're getting downvoted, Eastside Athens is shitty lol"
CFB,fdrqc5n,t3_emuovk,1578688138.0,Called it.
Athens,fdroqv4,t3_emwerx,1578687499.0,"**I've heard** good reviews about The Globe, **I've been told** their burgers are pretty good. Kind of a dive place, but good food.

Edit: It's been recommended to me. I've never been there. I was told it's kinda divey. You may not think so. I get it."
books,fdo7k9w,t3_em5s00,1578600263.0,Ready Player One is also similar in how the book was compared to the movie.
Athens,fdn5ltk,t3_em8z2u,1578577931.0,I believe most of the local grocery stores are hiring right now to replenish their staffs. Might be worth checking out.
AskReddit,fdn46fh,t1_fdlzhr0,1578576771.0,"Same. Or if I was going to be later then I had said, just call and give a heads up. Some other kids though, felt like they couldn't breathe without their parents freaking out."
Athens,fdmg2lp,t3_elzse7,1578548706.0,"It's a bad problem that happens on every road in Athens. People walk in the street when there's a sidewalk 5 feet away from them. I don't get it, but cops don't do anything about anything here unless it involves a shooting anymore. ACC even built all these pedestrian crosswalks over the place that NOBODY uses."
AskReddit,fdl08ss,t3_elssvy,1578514755.0,"I was like 8 or 9 and we were at a buffet restaurant having dinner. I asked my Mother how tall she thought I'd be and she pointed at a guy who was probably about 6 feet tall, but he was big and thick, not overweight, not msucular, but in between. She said ""You'll look like that guy.""

Me: ""I'm gonna be a big black guy when I'm older?!"""
todayilearned,fdkwvss,t3_elurq0,1578512826.0,"""Music's the only thing that makes sense anymore. Play it loud enough, it keeps the demons at bay."""
Athens,fdikudj,t3_elhztq,1578445146.0,"Oh look, more development that'll be empty in a few years."
CFB,fdihwxo,t3_elhsgm,1578443297.0,"Eh, the school will cancel last minute so the president seems like a cool guy."
AskReddit,fdfb849,t3_ekt5n3,1578357602.0,"No.
If we're late and we don't give notice, it's 1 attendance point.
If we're absent and don't give proper notice, it's still 1 attendance point.
So either way, I get the same point and I can use sick pay to pay the day's wages. I gain 1 day every two months and rarely call out, so I've now got a free day to use as I see fit."
news,fdbgrpt,t3_ekgldo,1578257209.0,"I didn't even think about them in Australia, but now that I have, that's exactly what I'd expect them to do."
pics,fcvvxqs,t1_fcvjvk3,1578011313.0,"Agreed. If they're qualified, fantastic. If not, gtfo."
AskReddit,fcvi924,t3_eiwc0j,1578002649.0,"Faster metabolism and/or desire to eat vegetables. Bigger penis.

Past that, it's been fairly decent considering."
funny,fcvhqxe,t3_ej12vj,1578002342.0,Wonder how hard it'd be to make it functional somehow.
Augusta,fcown33,t3_eiahwm,1577843599.0,"Whoever you bank with, setup an appointment with a loan officer and have them walk you through it and answer whatever questions you may have. That's part of the reason they're there, to help you; the customer. If you don't feel satisfied, try a different bank. You're the customer, you have the right to shop around and choose who gets your business. If you've done any of your own research, write out what you're looking at and what your questions are and what you don't understand and so on. They're there to help you but make no mistake, they want to sell you a loan that they will likely get a bonus for."
todayilearned,fconzo6,t3_ei5t7q,1577837025.0,I'm sure these comments will be sensible and adult like.
AskReddit,fcojjw9,t3_ei6sql,1577833822.0,There really isn't one. The internet has changed the game and the amount of plastic surgery is crazy. Every couple years another actress is all over.
CFB,fcojbps,t3_ei8a16,1577833652.0,I saw something on Twitter that encapsulates VT Football perfectly: VT grabbed defeat right out of the arms of victory. (wording might be off though)
funny,fcau3g8,t3_egw6b0,1577576637.0,LET HIM STAY SUPERMAN UNTIL HE CAN'T LIFT WEIGHTS.
