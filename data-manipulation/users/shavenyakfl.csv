WTF,ff9qi12,t3_es8c0i,1579718740.0,This is disturbing on multiple levels.
Halloweenmovies,ff8acth,t3_es1316,1579670783.0,"This and him coming out of the shadow behind Lorrie.

In this scene,  I also like how he's shown rising from the floor.  I always thought that was done well."
AskReddit,ff4fvwy,t3_erjied,1579562630.0,Americans are by and large stupid AF.  The main people that say things like this have never left the country and probably not done a lot of traveling within our borders.   We aren't nearly as free as we've led ourselves to believe.

todayilearned,ff1mcmr,t3_er0iue,1579481561.0,"Doesn't sound like much has changed.  We still only support our military *before* we send them to war.  When they come back, we'll nickel and dime them and the services rendered the rest of their life."

DC_Cinematic,feo629q,t1_fenosit,1579295584.0,"I agree. Hackman was cool, but I never disliked him.  Spacey's portrayal was ruthless.  Just an ugly guy.  Any actor than can make you dislike them is awesome.  Hackman is amazing, but not in that role."

todayilearned,femqjdi,t3_ep3gzs,1579266673.0,Thanks for the reminder of how much humanity sucks.
AskReddit,fdt0q67,t3_emqd57,1578710418.0,"Maui Jim

I've had Ray-Bans.  Once you go Maui, you don't go back.  Most everyone I've met that have had a pair said the same."

TheRiseOfSkywalker,fcw7v52,t3_ej0dtu,1578019155.0,It is uncreative story telling.  Everything has to be bigger and better with these movie makers.
NoStupidQuestions,fc1jsav,t3_efgpxl,1577320866.0,"To the OP, you wouldn't understand, due to how you were raised, but Santa is just magical.   And in this day and age, with kids growing up faster and faster, it's a very small window of wonder and magic, before it's gone forever."
