ostomy,fexm6ym,t1_fbidxfw,1579433234.0,What foods do you avoid that make it smell worse. I woke up with so much air in my bag that it could have rocketed to space. I emptied it in the hotel room and it smelled so bad for HOURS. I’d like to change my diet so it doesn’t smell so bad!
ostomy,fexk96x,t3_cmszuo,1579432353.0,"I know you posted this a while ago, but did you need to change it after swimming? I just got mine 3 months ago, and I spend so much time in the shower trying not to get it wet. But then I see posts like these and wonder if I’m wasting my time.

AdviceAnimals,fepwqqm,t3_eq9vwn,1579333667.0,"I finally flew back to the jobsite as an electrician after spending 3 months recovering from surgery. My colon perforated in the middle of the night and had to have parts of it cut out and now I have an ostomy bag. It’s cool though, guys at work call me shit bag but I’m their supervisor so we have fun. This morning my bag was so full of air. Like crazy full. I walked outside the hotel to let the gas out (because if I do it in the room, it smells like shit for 4-5 hours) and as soon as I popped the corner open, it exploded off my stomach and splattered on the ground. Shit went all over the sidewalk. I couldn’t help but laugh. Last time I cried because it was just too much to handle and was a big change. Now I’m like fuck it, I have two buttholes, you fellas can’t please either of them. Maybe buy me dinner first.
