You can even use as proof of concepts for potential investors for a bigger future idea. Honestly I actually find writing shorts harder than features. If you can tell a whole story in four minutes successfully, then you really have your finger on the pulse of what your story is. Even professional directors go back and create shorts between features. The Safdie brothers just put one out after Uncut Gems. Goldman vs Silverman. Check it out.  And good luck."

cats,ff1w2nd,t1_ff1vds6,1579487484.0,Absolutely. With my cat she was a kitten a couple of weeks old with fleas when I found her and the vet said she was too little to use any soaps or shampoos and I had to bath her with warm water every four hours. I think spending all that time in water early made her think it was normal for cats.  She still acts reluctant at first when she sees water but she circles it curiously and once she’s in she stays in no problem.

But as a huge Scorsese fan and a cinephile I’d say it sounds like you might have some baggage or preconceived notions about the genres he tends to work in. I’d really recommend leaving it a lone for now and not forcing it if you don’t like it. But don’t rule out coming back to it.

movies,fem1xb9,t3_epvc1o,1579237086.0,Most of the best 80s directors went to film school in the seventies and studied the greats of the 40s 50s and 60s. So while those earlier generations were pioneers experimenting in film making. It’s the USC kids in the 80s who really studied what was great film making and extrapolated the modern language of cinema out of it. And like someone else said the late nineties on was a complete lack of originality (in Hollywood) but that’s cyclical. About every thirty years Hollywood films become stagnant and the studios are forced to look to the fringe for new and exciting ways to make money. And in my opinion the indie turned mainstream film makers of the 60 and 90s are the most interesting and I can’t wait for this trend again.
