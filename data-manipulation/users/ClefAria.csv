Overwatch,ffybmzv,t1_ffxfsxw,1580342579.0,">Reaper was too good bud.

Against who? Almost every damage hero has a good matchup against him, even some of the supports are a legit threat depending on range, and tanks? The role that he's 'made to counter'? [It's not nearly that clear-cut.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/eucas4/was_this_mccree_buff_really_necessary/ffrfj8m/) (I'll guess you're a tank player based on your flair)

>He is supposed to be a low skill character.

What does that have to do with anything? Difficulty of mechanics and power level are two completely unrelated axes. Let's imagine the most 'low skill' damage hero possible: a hero who has no cooldowns, and a primary weapon that auto-aims like Visor at all times, with an infinite clip size. Couldn't be simpler, right? But if that weapon does 10 dps, they're trash-tier. If the weapon does 200 dps, they're game-breakingly powerful.

The difficulty of the mechanics has nothing to do with power level. Nothing.

>He was able to out heal most support abilities if he hit crits.

Delusion. I'll set you straight with the hard numbers.

The average Reaper (because of his pellet spread, this is pretty consistent at all SR tiers, actually) has an [accuracy of about 30%](https://www.overbuff.com/heroes/reaper). Reaper fires 20 pellets that do 7 damage each per shot, and in a cycle of 5.5 seconds (fire his whole clip (4s) and reload (1.5s), that works out to ~29 pellets per second (160 / 5.5).

With 31% accuracy (simpler math, also I'm fudging the figures in your favor, not mine), that means he hits with ~9 pellets per second. In order to do enough damage to outheal Mercy's beam (50 hps) with 40% life steal, ALL NINE PELLETS that hit must crit, to surpass 125 dps, which is what gets you 50 hps with 40% life steal.

Are you really going to try and argue that Reaper is critting with every single pellet that doesn't miss, on average? Come on. Don't look at the brief moments Reaper is plugging into a big target tank right in front of him and pretend that's his entire experience in the game. Those are fleeting, especially when you get to a high level and tank players don't just stand still in front of Reaper and try to 1v1 him straight-up.

>He requires very little skill to even do damage in the first place

Maybe you play against players who stand still and let you shoot them, but a player who knows what they're doing absolutely requires tracking/flicking skill to hit consistently. It's also a completely moot point when the vast majority of heroes are a lethal threat to him at a range where he is zero threat to them. Doesn't matter how good your aim is, if you're not right in their face, your effective dps is way lower than your opponent's, chances are.

>Besides that, his self heal made it unnecessarily hard to stop his ult.

Literally no ult is easier to stop than Death Blossom, lol. Without needing an ultimate of their own, all of the following 23 heroes can neutralize Death Blossom in some way (""ish"" for lesser/softer counters): Ana, Ashe, Baptiste, Bastion, Brigitte, D.va, Doomfist, Genji, Hanzo (ish), Junkrat, Lucio, McCree, Mei (ish), Orisa (ish), Pharah, Reinhardt (ish), Roadhog, Sigma, Soldier: 76 (ish), Sombra, Widowmaker, Winston (ish), Wrecking Ball (ish)

>If you burned even a single cool down needed, GG go next.

The chances of there being zero ways for the enemy team to handle Death Blossom at any given moment are pretty low on average. It takes a lot of cooldown tracking and game sense/awareness to have any success at Death Blossoming more than a single target.

Of course, if you're playing with low-level opponents, you can just randomly throw Death Blossom into entire teams and kill them all more often than not.

It seems obvious to me that the two of us play at very different levels."
Competitiveoverwatch,ffxgnv2,t1_ffucldm,1580324768.0,"No reason for Reaper to get buried again, sigh. So many counters and tools that destroy him, the worst dps ult in the game by far, and only ever comes anywhere close to meta when a whole comp is built around him to compensate for his massive weaknesses.

Really makes me not want to go back into a GM comp game with him. It was hard enough already making that climb."
Overwatch,ffxe3o2,t3_ev0y03,1580323277.0,"Reaper was not even meta anymore when he got nerfed again, and when he was, it was only because of a team comp compensating for his massive weaknesses. Now he's back in the dumpster, thanks to whiny players who aren't willing to utilize of the many, many, MANY heroes/tools that completely shut him down.

Why you gotta do me like this, Jeff?"

Competitiveoverwatch,ffrfj8m,t1_ffntdul,1580157072.0,"Thing is, Reaper doesn't ""destroy"" all tanks 1v1. Some yes (Rein (though shield up move speed buff has improved his longevity significantly), Sigma), some have a decent matchup (Roadhog, Zarya (at high energy), Orisa (post-patch, it was actually in Orisa's favor before as long as Fortify was usable)), and some have a bad matchup, but can easily disengage from him at will (D.va, Winston, Ball).

To add to that, almost every damage hero is strong against Reaper, and even some of the supports are a significant threat, especially at range (Zen, Ana, Bap).

Overall, Reaper loses the vast majority of 1v1s, especially in high level play. Reaper has only ever been strong in the meta when there was an outside factor compensating for his massive weaknesses. Most recently, it was a deathball composition with strong shields that worked for the same reason goats did (and that's gone now, with the shield nerfs--notice how Hanzo immediately took his place in the 'meta team' as soon as this happened). Last time, it was because Nano boost, a *different hero's ultimate*, made his terrible ultimate worthwhile by making it not quite as sluggish as it normally is.

It made no sense to nerf Reaper, and the insult to injury is that his biggest counter, McCree, got buffed in the same patch, lol..."
Overwatch,ffg61ql,t1_fffl3k9,1579899224.0,">Is this a low elo thing that women are constantly insulted?

I think it might be related, because my experience is similar (been Master most of my OW 'career', GM now). Honestly, I actually have more memories of dealing with toxic female players than overhearing toxicity toward female players. For two different chunks of a few months each, I played a lot of Quick Play (SR too different for comp) in a duo with two women. Even when basically every game I was in had a woman in it, I did not hear a single instance of female-prompted antagonism. And both of those women were in voice regularly.

My own roommate, a female Bronze-level player, has received plenty of salt, enough that she isn't too hot on playing competitive anymore, but none of it was gender-focused either.

So I don't know if it's just the phenomenon where you're more likely to hear the complaints than the neutral/positive experiences or what, but we're definitely not all having the same experience/perception."

Competitiveoverwatch,fff0x5z,t1_ffdmeu3,1579872627.0,"McCree was already counter picked against me every game I played Reaper, and was easily his hardest counter imo, due to the fact that in addition to being one of the many, *many* dps heroes that has a range advantage against him, flashfan also gives him the edge up close, which is *supposed* to be the one range where Reaper is good.

And now he gets a huge buff at the same time Reaper gets nerfed.

Reaper can't catch a fucking break, lol...he gets one whiff of fresh air, and everyone freaks out to stuff him right back into dumpster tier, where he's been the vast majority of the game's lifespan.

You could say I'm ""amazed"" by this patch as well, but for a different reason..."
SelfAwarewolves,ff9tkqx,t1_ff9sriw,1579720969.0,">removing sexism from the equitation  would also change that

That's simply not true. For example, [the more gender-equal a country is, the FEWER women it has in STEM fields.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719?journalCode=pssa)

Women and men naturally diverge in their interests, and will rarely, if ever, be perfectly equally interested in any given professional ambition, regardless of however much societal pressure there is or isn't. The research shows that these differences *increase* when there is *more* freedom for either sex to freely choose their career path.

The only way you will ever get a perfectly 50:50 sex split in politics is by forcing uninterested women in, and/or forcing interested men out. That's the bottom line.
