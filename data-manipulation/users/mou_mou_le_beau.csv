TooAfraidToAsk,ffrbzm4,t3_eukwcp,1580154902.0,"You know, you could study abroad in Europe. Tuition is free in many countries but usually requires you take language classes. It might be a lot to save initially to set yourself up with flights and accomodation but it will stop your crippling debt in the long run!"
iamverysmart,ffm1bhn,t1_ffjr5nv,1580046961.0,"Thats how i do it too.  But if its any easy fraction of say 25%, i work out whats 50% off- 12.50, then half that amount again 6.25. 25-6.25=$18.75.

Or if its 20%, work out 10% by moving the decimal $25.00 to 2.50 then double it for 20% = $5 which is the savings, so take $5 off =$20.

Discounts are so much easier in decimals than fractions."

femalehairadvice,femrkkt,t1_feldghj,1579267575.0,You have a gorgeous colour!! I would keep it as is and go for a shorter textured cut and style with a focus on  olume like this would look amazing! https://pin.it/lv3hq3jskk2zy6

femalehairadvice,femqm04,t3_eptnyg,1579266738.0,"Some layers through it would frame your face better. And less product as it looks greasy. Perhaps some toner on the ends to remove some of the brassiness and raise the balyage up midway for more dimension. 

I'm super jelly of your curls they are amazing!"
femalehairadvice,femq9ub,t3_epu3cq,1579266432.0,Honey or warm balayage of highlights would be nice!
femalehairadvice,femq89y,t3_epxzis,1579266392.0,I think the balayage is a better suit for you. The peekaboo look goes really trashy looking unless it's really well cared for.
femalehairadvice,femq1c7,t3_epx758,1579266217.0,I think the colour works for you but just a tad uneven but could look great once it's balanced. Make sure you use toner and give your hair some love by getting a cut! It's pretty dead on the ends!
femalehairadvice,fempvzv,t3_epkm3h,1579266084.0,I think all you need to do is flip your hair to one side and add a little texturising spray. Colour is perfect for your skin and you have great length. But perhaps add a semi on the roots?
femalehairadvice,fempr28,t3_epmb7g,1579265955.0,I would also suggest that this colour with a few warm highlights would also suit your skin better than your natural colour
