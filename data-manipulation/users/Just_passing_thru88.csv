Philippines,ff4o91w,t1_ff4clse,1579568438.0,Thank you so much. Will definitely give them a try!
AirForce,ff260kt,t1_ff24ott,1579494785.0,Don’t let anyone on a Reddit dampen your pride in serving in the World’s Greatest Air Force! There are people all over the world that would love the opportunity to get married in mess dress and serve in the Air Force. Most people come to Reddit to just complain but deep inside they are glad to be in the Air Force.
AirForce,ff24gvk,t3_er0xfy,1579493550.0,I completely understand the pre-test jitters and anxiety but don’t sweat taking a pt test with your Wing/CC. Guarantee they won’t think twice about how fast you run your mile and a  half. I took a pt test once with the AFPC/CC ( 2 star) and he smoked all of us. He was there at the finish line cheering us on! You got this Airman!

AmItheAsshole,fezlkwf,t3_eqt296,1579458650.0,"NTA at all. He got what he deserved, a big ole piece of humble pie. Can’t stand people that know everything and have to one up everyone including there significant other. 

P.S. if you haven’t realized it yet, don’t waste no more time on him. Time to move on, you’ll be grateful later"
AmItheAsshole,feylfni,t3_eqk9ht,1579447165.0,NTA. This sounds really weird. Why on earth would the siblings share a room and then all their other spouses share a room? Makes no logical sense at all. I would get a hotel ASAP.

Christianity,fevr2gp,t3_eqqct7,1579400483.0,"As humans it is natural to have those feelings but as we grow in our walk with Christ, we start seeing people as sisters in Christ and not just admiring their body. When we focus on their body, that can turn into lust which can hinder our walk with God. I would just encourage you to pray about it and your feelings toward her."
Coffee,femw9gw,t3_eq0xdb,1579271263.0,I’m right there with you. I went from being able to drink 4 cups of coffee in the middle of the night and sleep right away to not being able to drink 1 cup without getting super jittery and feeling dizzy. Crazy experience and I don’t know why either. I miss drinking coffee so much as I truly love the way it taste
Poldark,fei1732,t3_ep4fv9,1579128050.0,Amazing series. Finished it last week and I am having withdrawals from it.
Poldark,fdso0gl,t3_emfhu0,1578705717.0,It’s a must. Phenomenal show!

offmychest,fdcbpgc,t1_fdc9wan,1578271100.0,Great advice! Thanks for sharing. That’s what I try most days but this daily grind is still annoying and there has to be more we can do to live a fulfilling life
offmychest,fdc7qib,t1_fdc7ipp,1578268742.0,Yep. I know I’m not the only one that feels this way but why don’t we do something about it?
AmItheAsshole,fcofwoe,t3_ei4fu7,1577831262.0,"ESH. What would it hurt to just let her and the kids stay there? From the way you describe it, it seems like if she didn’t rent it then it would just sit empty for the week. When did we become a society so concerned about money that we fail to give to the less fortunate especially when they are family. She should understand and shouldn’t complain since you are giving her a “discount”. IMO, just let her use it for the week but make sure she knows this is a one time gift and to expect it in the future."
AmItheAsshole,fcbvjn8,t3_egwqp2,1577591444.0,"ESH. Yes what she did was messed up but if it’s so valuable you should have taken it with you, had a passcode or insurance on such a expensive device. One should know that kids find there way into every room and find every electronic device. Suing your sister is a bit extreme. Doesn’t sound like y’all have a great relationship to begin with but no IPad is worth a ruined family situation"
Anxiety,fc3yxsd,t3_efve4l,1577402236.0,I have experienced this before and it was awful. Not a good experience and pretty much wrecked my life for several months but I just want to encourage you that it will get better. I was prescribed some medicine and did some CBT therapy and those both helped a lot. I feel almost like “normal”. You got this!
offmychest,fc1ecrz,t1_fbzpdvj,1577316234.0,And your point is? I’m not saying they don’t deserve to be respected or thanked but they don’t risk their life for others or willing to die for our freedom
offmychest,fby8dgd,t3_ef18vj,1577210573.0,Go cry me a river. Go deploy to a desert for a year getting shot at and lose some of your closest friends then tell me scientist deserve as much respect.
AirForce,fbfmw74,t3_ecxgo5,1576814625.0,"Congrats, test is scheduled for the 30th and I need to drop 3 inches. Not fun at all but I made this bed so I have to lay in it. But I hope we hear something soon on the new test."
