NintendoSwitch,ffd39np,t1_ffcv8x4,1579812565.0,What gets me is how nobody in my social circle even know what this game is. Even my gamer friends don’t really know about it until I say something.
NintendoSwitch,ffd35ay,t1_ffd0msc,1579812494.0,"I can see how that would be a hinderance. When Minecraft first came out, I was turned off by the art style. When I eventually got over it and tried it, I enjoyed the game quite a bit. I think the graphics work for SDV but I think it would also be amazing if it was different."
NintendoSwitch,ffd2r4q,t1_ffcuyn8,1579812269.0,I first got it for PS4 and quickly realized it was the sort of game I’d like to play at my computer desk so I could easily make notes. I love that everyone has their own play style!
NintendoSwitch,ffd2ntm,t3_esx61y,1579812217.0,"I’ve purchased this game on the Switch, PS4, and the PC. I feel each purchase was justified and money well spent!"
AskReddit,ff4qyof,t1_ff44q36,1579570323.0,"I don’t mean this as snarky, so I hope it doesn’t come across that way. I think it’s great you have life goals and wants all figured out! What’s your life like now? I work, and while I find it meaningful and fulfilling, I find my days off to be even better. Those are the days I can do what’s truly important to me like unwind with my family and go camping. I can’t do that during the week while I’m working. I’ll retire as soon as possible because while there is happiness at work, the true contentment is at home for me."
macarons,ff3jueb,t3_erepuy,1579542583.0,"When I made macarons the first time, I was at a class where all our pans went into the same industrial oven after all having sat out to form a skin for the same amount of time. 

About a quarter of mine split like this, while none of the other hundreds did. Because we were all in the same oven and had the same amount of time to form a skin, the instructor ruled out the oven/rest time being factors which made sense to me. The only thing we could think of was when I was whipping the egg whites, I think I went thirty seconds too long. They were a tad past the stiff peaks stage."

bulletjournal,ff2he0a,t3_er5fc4,1579506217.0,This is super cool! Which part of the state are you coming to?
dontdeadopeninside,fephimy,t1_fen38xe,1579320636.0,"Oh. I thought it was Gameroom, a weird kids name. I said it Ga-mare-oom in my head. Game room makes a lot more sense."
FarmsofStardewValley,fendqk4,t3_eq0zrl,1579282496.0,"The layout for your crops, huts, and scarecrows is great!"
MadeMeSmile,feh1l0e,t1_feh0996,1579107233.0,"Listen to this mom* :)

If my son grows up still able to appreciate the small things, lean heavily into his light-hearted side, and be a good member of his family and community, I’ll know I’ve done well by him! 

I’m sorry you were rushed to grow up. It’s a shame that so many adults push that onto children. My son is 10 and while I fully believe in instilling a sense of responsibility in him by way of chores and setting high expectations, I also laugh at and encourage his fart jokes and let him play video games because balance is everything, isn’t it?"
MadeMeSmile,fegxg6n,t1_fegj3ne,1579104698.0,Never lose that child-like sense of calm. It’s so important!
konmari,fegt0nx,t1_feg7y3n,1579101859.0,"I know many people rinse and use the same cup for the entirety of their period. Softcup also makes (made? I haven’t seen it in a while) a cup that’s meant to be used that way. For me, the benefits are no unexpected leaks, less frequent bathroom visits for the express purpose of switching out products, and comfortability. I didn’t realize how uncomfortable and time-consuming tampons were until I made the switch. It’s great to take care of it in the morning then go about my day without giving it a second thought until sometime after work!"
AskReddit,feg0xui,t3_eosez4,1579072237.0,Slow down! Think about letter formation.
konmari,fefvdgb,t1_fefe3h4,1579066417.0,"Creating less waste was just one of the reasons I made the switch. Two different styles didn't work for me and then I found this. So while it doesn't cross off everything on my wish list, it's a great option for me. As far as saving money, I never actually did the math. I'd imagine it comes close to my previous method, but then again, cost savings wasn't my biggest motivator for making the switch either :)"
