I'm not saying pensions are a terrible thing necessarily but you can do a lot better than a pension with a Roth IRA or a 401k, especially if you get matching contributions from your employer. Pensions are typically invested very conservatively while with a Roth IRA or 401k you can choose what it's invested in and can typically make more. Also, south a 401k it is YOUR money to do edith as you please at retirement, can be taken with you if you leave your current company, and doesn't die with you."

I agree that we probably should be able to cut some of the fat from the military budget but that's a tricky bitch because a lot of that spending goes right to factory jobs and it's highly unlikely a Congress person will vote for that and risk their job. Part of the problem with the military spending is we are basically the world police which I don't love but i'm also not too keen on ceding that role to China. 

On the regulation of wall street. What you described would more than likely send us into another recession and I highly doubt the political will will be there for that.

If you're like me, lower middle income, the premiums are ridiculous and you still have to pay out of pocket for certain things. Good luck affording rent, food, and insurance. You might have to settle for two out of three. 

Another thing that absolutely pisses me off is when someone is hurt through no fault of their own and have to do a fucking go fund me to raise money to pay medical bills. You see this all the time with cops injured ON THE JOB and you would think they have decent enough insurance.
