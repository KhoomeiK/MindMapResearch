restaurateur,ffymdor,t1_ffg6zgn,1580349866.0,"You seem to think the only way to make more money is to increase the number of people through your door. 

You can be more efficient and waste less. You can keep your staff on tighter hours. You can get better deals on ingredients. You can get your per person average (how much each customer buys) way up if your servers push (which usually works better with rewards). 

All of this will increase profit, which is far more important. You can absolutely double your profit without having extra people walk through the door."
AskReddit,ffyjyh0,t1_ffv5i8i,1580348223.0,"This is definitely true. It’s easy to think you’re really smart til you’ve sat down with someone who runs circles around you. If you never put yourself in a room with them, you’ll never realize it."
AskReddit,ffygx3i,t1_ffwpe2u,1580346152.0,What is the average household income? Look it up. Check what kind of average it is.
AskReddit,ffygnm7,t1_ffwgivj,1580345972.0,That doesn’t stop people from using the word to mean any of the three. Which they do.
AskReddit,ffygjus,t1_ffwdlzi,1580345901.0,Lay people maybe. I’ve seen median used for most things on big scale because mean is easily skewed.
AskReddit,ffyewox,t1_ffwqlq9,1580344780.0,"That’s how mean works. Fortunately we have more than one way of averaging!
A median is still an average.

And we know intelligence is a general distribution curve not prone to outliers like your example. 

Please try again!"
AskReddit,ffy9ed8,t1_ffwayow,1580341145.0,"To be fair, places like England shipped off everyone who disagreed with them, most of their poor and prostitutes and criminals. Maybe it actually worked and they’re seeing the results now!"
AskReddit,ffy8c2m,t1_ffw5fcc,1580340533.0,It’s amazing how many people are ignorant of the (recent) past and think regulation is destroying business. I keep seeing arguments for anarchy and libertarianism. Yeah we used to have that. That’s exactly why we have regulation now. It didn’t fucking work.

todayilearned,ffvvjge,t1_ffuonm3,1580274527.0,"You just agreed that you’d rather it take someone 50 years to save than have them be able to start a business today through an investor. If every single company out there could only be started by the rich, we would still be in the feudal fiefdoms. Sorry my bad... I guess that’s a little past the Stone Age."
news,ffvvdxt,t1_ffvdz48,1580274393.0,I made tons of money on tips and didn’t care that I lost a couple of hours of hourly wage per week. I busted my ass to make money during lunch rush so I skipped my break as often as possible. It’s great work for the money you make and I often miss the simplicity of it.

news,ffupgvw,t1_ffuc6ru,1580246801.0,"I totally agree with you. But it’s reasonable for the police to take some precautions. Putting a barrier between you isn’t unreasonable. If you’re drunk and unruly (even if not violent) while they’re driving, it can cause an accident. Better to isolate you.

Now buying an APC and using it to deliver subpoenas seems a little silly, but I used to work in process serving and I know there were times where my servers would refuse to go to a house because they found it dangerous (like a meth den). They would have us call the sheriff to deliver those summons. But why should the sheriff have to risk their life to deliver a piece of paper? Should they go in unarmed assuming there is no one violent present?

I don’t know what the answer is. I think it’s reasonable to give some protection. An APC seems overkill."
todayilearned,ffuo29e,t1_ffuiw2y,1580246003.0,"It’s fascinating to me that you would rather we live in the Stone Age than give every day people a chance at upward mobility by providing them funds to start their own business.

Back in the day there weren’t investors. There were just kings."

todayilearned,ffu3bif,t1_fftsgvj,1580233583.0,"So say you want to start your own company. Let’s say it’s something simple like a hardware store or a gas station. How are you going to get money to build out an empty lot and set that up? Save for 50 years and then start your business?

An investor makes your life easier by letting you start today, in exchange for interest on the loan. 

A stock investor is no different."
patientgamers,ffu0kye,t3_ev5a70,1580231890.0,Just wanted to point out Starcraft 2 added a whole coop mode where you get hero units and everything. It’s free to play as well. You can always create a custom game vs bots (I think that’s what skirmish mode means here).

Why do we have reality tv? Because people love it. They watch it more and more, so more and more shows are made. 

Same thing with these interviews."

NBC link goes to Forbes article. Forbes article says click here to see methodology. Links to another Forbes article about their top 400, with no methodology described. Fuck ton of ads though.

I’ve read up on Forbes’ other lists and found them to be pretty lacking in research. Perhaps this one is better."

videos,ffqtcrd,t1_ffj6vo3,1580143187.0,"Perhaps you are not using the right numbers bc of US measurements?

2000 lbs is 1 ton. 
2000 / 38 lbs/bucket = 52.6 buckets/ton
$1000/52.6 = 19.0 $/bucket

It’s sad to me that I have to explain this next part. Perhaps you should take a more comprehensive math class where they teach critical thinking...

Yes, 10000/365 is 27. However, that is assuming one works 7 days a week, which they (usually) do not. If we just do the basic 365*5/7, we will see there are 260 week days in a year. However, there are holidays and so on. So 10000/250 = 40 $/day. 

As I am an asian math teacher, this was pretty disappointing to read.

patientgamers,ffij164,t1_ffi59jt,1579975037.0,"The human relationships seem quite standard? A man who lost his daughter is forced to care for another girl that reminds him of her in order to save the world. He rejects her at first and then slowly warms to her, to the point where he’s willing to not just die for her, but literally kill the good guys to keep her alive.

He decides he’s going to save her over saving the world because he can’t bear to lose another daughter.

It’s not a super inventive story line in basic form, but what they nailed was the subtlety of their relationship and the way that he slowly comes to care more and more about her. The realization at the end that he’s just a straight sociopath and she may not actually be better off with him is pretty unique. She knows he’s lying and chooses to go with him anyway."
patientgamers,ffiijla,t1_ffi3i0r,1579974702.0,"Yeah I think it’s too deep/subtle for most 15 year olds, so Reddit is out."

His companies might be reporting losses, and that might mean he’s lost money, but that 4.5 billion figure he started with is something he told them afaik."

Sure sounds like anarchy to me. That’s from YOUR source.

But congrats on taking one sentence of my argument and finding a minor correction with which to dismiss the entire thing. You sound 12 spouting your bullshit buzzwords. Guess you’re a proto-debater... don’t worry you’ll grow into it.

Show me an example of real world anarchy working. Even that entire wiki had ZERO examples. It’s just a few mentions of people who thought the idea would be better... yet none of them managed to even leave the society they so despised."
videos,ffg04tk,t1_fffdvhw,1579895585.0,"They are pulling animal fat leftovers out of the gutter. After it’s cooked with and thrown down the sink, it congeals and floats on top of the sewage. They are using ladles to skim it off the top and then melting it back down to resell.

I’m sure they could cut actual oil too, but that would cut into their profit margins."
videos,fffzw8k,t1_fffhpo7,1579895439.0,"Ah yes the costs of walking around with a bucket and ladle. Google says a bucket of cooking oil is about 38lbs. If one ton of oil sells for $1000 (someone else posted this estimate from wiki), that’s $19 a bucket, once you get the junk out. Average income in China appears to be under 10k a year, which is about $40 a day, so that’s baller money."

I hate the game because they make it an endless grind with low drop rates so they can justify it being f2p. Diablo 3 has waayyyy better drop rates because they’re not trying to sell stash tabs and other random inventory devices."

CatastrophicFailure,ffd1886,t1_ffcr20u,1579811411.0,"Yes I read that one too. It’s just a different spin on the same definition. 

Here’s a real question for you: if it’s so great, why doesn’t it exist? Are there ANY real life examples of this working?

Cavemen started in anarchy. It was the de facto default. Literally all life began that way. And yet today we have almost 200 nations, none of which (to my knowledge) practice anarchy. If it worked, it would exist. Perhaps if it was truly great, it would’ve flourished, right?

This is the dumbest argument I keep seeing on Reddit. The entire concept of libertarian and anarchist is grounded in fantasy. It only takes a few assholes to ruin it, and there are too many assholes.

What would the world be without roads? Public education? Sewers? Police? These are all constructs humans have invented in order to impose order, not move away from it. People consign themselves to these social contracts because it is better. You are using the internet to voice your opinion on a device created within those rules. Nothing could be more ironic or moronic."
