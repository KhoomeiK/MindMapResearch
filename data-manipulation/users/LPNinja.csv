OnePiece,fffx4pg,t3_esndbl,1579893725.0,"I think whatever Orochi did to Oden‘s father was threatened to other people as well (because the following panels show civillians being killed for resisting). That might‘ve been one of many reasons why Orochi had Oden in a lockhold.


Not only that but Oden talking about a ship and Kaido shows some sort of deal they made?



I feel like the flashbacks will end soon, maybe 2 chapters left (?), I can already feel a huge tragedy building up :(


To think that Oden died and couldn‘t free Wano, living through ridicule year over year over a deal that Orochi never valued... It‘s actually really really sad."

Meaning - You might think a study says this but then in the end of it, it might say that e.g. itâ€˜s limited because cultural factors were not included/left out or that there needs to be studies done on basis of how much culture or media influences it.

A varity of studies basically just prove what you witness in real life and thatâ€™s that there are many different people with different tastes and youâ€˜ll never find an all applyable rule for everyone and everything. Including different perspectives and studies with different results is important to confirm what we already witness in our lives every day"

Our government (Germany) said they wonâ€˜t support any military actions, yet the US can still place their atom bombs here + coordinate drone attacks from Rammstein, I am sure the other allies will operate just the same, even if they dislike Trump."

I donâ€˜t know *what* they found but when people say that Roger laughed because he was bitter, I donâ€˜t really agree.


One Piece always revolves around a theme of happiness, freedom and laughing. Knowing Oda and knowing how he characterized Luffy as well as Roger, Iâ€˜m actually sure that whatever Roger saw must be genuienly funny + mirror how the reader would react if we got to witness the One Piece too ðŸ¤”

Maybe even (but thatâ€˜s purerly speculation) whatever Joyboy said can be linked to what Luffy and Roger said that others consider 'crazy' or 'childish' + making them laugh too in the end"
OnePiece,fcgnvai,t3_eh633x,1577642219.0,"I think itâ€˜s actually sth 'absurd' along the lines of ""Iâ€˜ll hold the biggest party/banquet/celebration"" or ""I will celebrate with the worldâ€œ because thereâ€˜s so much emphasis on laughing and celebrating throughout the manga + the last panel was all about laughing as well + Laugh Tale.

Itâ€˜s equally childish and would make you go ""huh... why would you want to just celebrate"" + in Stampede Luffy said to Douglas the party would be boring if e.g. heâ€˜d get rid of 'weak' people (or sth along the lines). Itâ€˜s also sth. Sandman theorized on that thereâ€˜s a connection to laughtale and that the D might be a :D from the emoticon.

So yeah maybe something innocent/childish as that?"
