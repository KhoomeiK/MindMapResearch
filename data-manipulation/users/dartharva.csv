You should encrypt everything you share, but it's easy enough now that you don't need to worry about it.

Most popular email services like Gmail encrypt your files in transit, but you can use [Mailvelope](https://www.mailvelope.com/en) to secure your emails with E2E encryption from the browser itself.

The popular modern chat apps like Whatsapp and Telegram have E2E encryption enabled for all files by default."

1. It frees the user from the manufacturer's despotic policies (like forced DRM and telemetry)
2. It enables education. Had there been more protection from piracy for Microsoft windows or Office, entire generations from the third world would have been left out of computer literacy."
