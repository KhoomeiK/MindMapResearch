The programs that design the space shuttle and like tech are, internally at least, primarily focused on progress and human cooperation toward real space exploration, and so I’ll bet they push to ensure the information is released eventually. 

The fact that the US and Russia even participated in a secretive and competitive “space race” had to be enourmously frustrating for the engineers and scientists.

We have an antique and unique gun emporium(not a museum, its technically a shop, but the price tags on these firearms mean they often sit in display cases for years anyway) down the road from me, and I’ll guarantee you they’ve got a stockpile of ammunition in their basement.

So I quit TurboTax, downloaded the forms and filled them out manually. I’ve been doing my taxes by hand every year since, even for the small business.

On top of that, many shoplifters bank on the fact that the employees at the front of the store are either not paying attention, or not willing to actually do anything. In fact a really commonly stolen item from some stores is Televisions, and the technique is to simply find a TV with no lock/wrap on it near the back of the store, pick it up and walk out the front door carrying yourself as though you did pay for it. E.g. at some back counter.

Tvs, boomboxes, computer accessories, anything of the sort that seems viable is a target for a shoplifter because they’re apt to just sell or trade the goods anyway."

Drugs,ff8oh0v,t3_es8yoc,1579688910.0,"Less is more when moving through TSA. Tossing herb under the pills and cotton in a vitamin or ibuprofen bottle is usually enough since they don’t care why there’s extra fiber in the bottle. For things that can go into capsules, throw then in with other similar looking ones like you said. Don’t so things like stuffing a pill bottle in a sock and wrapping it in a shirt, that solid object in a wad of clothes will raise more attention on yhe scanner than if a nondescript bottle is included with your toiletries.

 NEVER put anything illegal in a checked bag. Even if its just as well hidden, the tsa agent who decides to randomly search your bag might be a bit more thorough. Basically just find a convenient place near like objects in your carry on and as long as you don’t have any knives, explosives, or liquid quantities greater than 3oz, I expect you’ll go through security without any issue.

However, in my personal opinion, when flying you should just leave the substances at home if you can. Weed I’ve seen go through TSA without issue a million times, and I’ve had capsules/pills travel with ease in my toiletries, even when I get pulled aside for extra screening."
