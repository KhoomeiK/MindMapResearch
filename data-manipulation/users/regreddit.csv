DJs,fgkgjya,t3_eyybj8,1580865059.0,"There may be plenty of these apps out there but I am 99% sure I wrote the app Jimmy was ""pitching"" over the long Thanksgiving weekend last year. I'm not going to link to it,  but it's a Progressive Web App called ""Hey DJ"" and I wrote it as a web developer who's also a DJ. My wife is a teacher and out of obligation I DJ a TON of middle school dances and events, and there's literally a line of kids at every gig trying to get me to play their favorite song. It consumes me at a gig. So I sat down Thanksgiving weekend and wrote the app as a way to keep my DJ booth clear at events. I have a sign at the end of the table with a QR code that takes them to my page in the app. They can request a song, and up/down vote songs, and it keeps them entertained trying to brigade/game the system to see what songs they can get voted to the top. I will play the top song every 20 minutes or so. I never commercialized (nor intented to) the app in any way, but am positive they are talking about my app, because the name and functionality are 100% the same. I've only ever used it at school events. I've no clue how they found it if in fact they used my app as their 'idea', but if you listen carefully to what Jimmy calls it at the beginning, it's my website's exact url, including extension (hint, it's not a .com). Very funny."
