 Psychological illness reaches far greater nuanced depths than your typical ""lunatic"" talking to themselves, hallucinating or whatever other generic stereotypical idea of what constitutes schizophrenia.

Honestly, I actually think you'd do yourself a ton of favours by cutting her out and moving on from her. If she has trust issues and is secretive, game-playing now then do you think it's gonna be any better further down the line if you develop something more serious? I hate to say it but I think you can only stand to get hurt in this and for self-preservation reasons you should get out now before it gets harder to later and you get hurt even more. Telling you not to steal outta her bag, being too paranoid to give a location, playing games with your heart (being busy is one thing - I'm hella busy and also ignore my phone much of the day but I can see if I got a message and it takes a second to reply).. Are you sure she's definitely single btw? 

As for my situation: it goes deeper. She described me as sexy, Adonis, always calls me attractive etc which I know can be just a friendly thing and that's fine - girls can say that platonically to guy friends of course from an objective point of view - *but she's also told me she's got a crush on me, had imagined being with me in a relationship, traveling together* and we've god damn fucking slept together. We're even planning a little holiday.  

Then a day later she'll just ghost me, tell me she's going out to dinner with her ex and why can't I just be normal about it instead of making it a big deal?! Are you kidding me? She's a big girl playing wee girl games whether she knows it or not and it's fucking with my head daily. 

The same day we slept together after a beautiful night where she said ""it feels like you're my boyfriend""....she got home and immediately messaged ""we should just be mates"" so I said ok, let's not talk for a while...she messaged me on other formats because I blocked her and got irate at me blocking her saying SHE felt like an idiot. What the actual fuck?? How does she think I feel?! And here's the best part.... multiple times she's said to me ""I'm way too innocent and people take advantage"". Bravo .

How about we just be adults?  

The going silent thing your kinda-missus is doing is shite. It's fine to be busy but they know damn well that they're going silent... especially after she's flirting and shit with you. Either she doesn't really realise the gravity of her words and should check herself, or she is playing a game and should grow up.

I've had this girl absolutely fucking my head up like nobody's business. We actually slept together but are ""mates"". She lives with her ex, but messages me from the morning to the night. She got me a gift for Christmas and a gushing note hidden inside. She wants to introduce me to her friends...then suddenly tells me she's trying to get back together with her ex, she's decided to join tinder. I have to admit, embarrassingly as I don't usually let chicks get under my skin, that she has played me well and I can't help but like her too much despite knowing she's a total mindfuck whether she realises it or not. Fucking games...fucking women. Life was easier when I just had one night stands and fuck buddies."
