WeWantPlates,feucead,t3_eqhlmg,1579385255.0,I would like to point out that rubber ducks are notorious for growing mold inside and the sugar in the drink is definitely going to exacerbate that.

EntitledBitch,fejc0rk,t1_f6k5ocm,1579166424.0,Oh man I forgot about Brother Nature! Gonna go and watch all his shit now!!! Thanks!! üòó
EntitledBitch,fejaqia,t3_el86ha,1579164526.0,Lol she should see my dad's truck. He uses it for work and transporting my seven year old brother. It probably has tiny lifeforms with their own unique ecosystems in the carpets by now.
EntitledBitch,fej8o2r,t3_eorymy,1579161670.0,I can never get over people who are vegan-by-choice when they're homeless. Your options for food are limited but you're going to cut those options down even more?
mendrawingwomen,fej6sz2,t3_epb8jw,1579159272.0,Those knees though. Like a toothpick with marshmallows on either end.

foundsatan,fed0sk9,t3_eo5wbb,1578992956.0,I just realised how dangerous this sort of prank is. One bite of those doughnuts would kill my mother since she's severely allergic to mustard. Expecting one food (and knowing the typical ingredients) and getting another has potential disaster written all over it.
WatchPeopleDieInside,feczhkx,t3_eobwua,1578991161.0,Idk if she's trying to be sexy so much as trying not to get knocked out by her own boobs.
asexuality,fdy9ntb,t1_fdw2me6,1578777503.0,Oh my God! Good point. I cannot believe the whole plot of the series relied on two people fucking despite being hunted by a murder bot.
AskReddit,fdu974v,t3_emwbv3,1578729762.0,Frixion pens were a lifesaver for my OCD.
asexuality,fdu567x,t1_fdu527w,1578727734.0,Right? Even if I wasn't asexual my main priority would be not dying.
asexuality,fdu4smk,t3_emybg6,1578727553.0,"Horror or action movies bother me most. Like seriously, you're on the run from monsters or rival spies or some shit but you're gonna take a break to fuck?"
rareinsults,fdtuv4p,t3_emzkmb,1578722586.0,I'm actually genuinely curious; what is the cut off for being able to use the n-word? Can half black people say it? What about my little brother? He's a quarter black. Or do you have to be fully black?
MakeMeSuffer,fdpegvq,t3_emd058,1578626543.0,Fucking gross but I guess...plenty of mammals eat the placenta after birth but that's usually out of necessity. Ick.

entitledparents,fdlf4w6,t1_fdlexaa,1578522680.0,Well yes but I wanted to distinguish which parent it was.
childfree,fdjra9f,t3_ef1yi2,1578484515.0,This is so special and so important. My parents love kids but they accept and support me wholeheartedly in my CF stance. They bought me both of my kitties and refer to them as my children. I am also asexual and single by choice so my dad calls our dog my boyfriend.
AskReddit,fdjlt58,t1_fdjk0zq,1578477041.0,Nope! But very interesting to see other names with the same meaning!
aww,fdje6s8,t1_fdjckio,1578467089.0,I expected my interminably grumpy cat to hiss and spit at the vet when I first took her but all she did was hide against my chest with her back to him. I felt so needed.

wowthanksimcured,fdjb61o,t3_eleohe,1578463931.0,My cats may be the main reason I don't take a long walk off a short pier but they sure as hell don't cure my brain's inability to produce enough serotonin.
killitwithfire,fdjaxtk,t3_elcztv,1578463708.0,It took me way too long to realise it was a pig. I didn't even notice the obvious pig/chicks because I was so focused on the adult.

AskReddit,fcisaap,t3_eh8gs2,1577668619.0,Sometimes it doesn't work on anxiety the same way for everyone. I tried it and it didn't do anything for my anxiety. It felt like. It made me panic slower but more deeply.
morbidquestions,fcirwlp,t3_ehc5hz,1577668367.0,After I visit the dentist for a cleaning my gums are very sore but I like to bite down to create more pressure to feel the soreness more fully. Pain and pleasure are two sides of the same coin I think.

spiderbro,fc6hx8i,t3_egacap,1577480983.0,I have no problem with baby crawlies in general but I once got a nasty surprise when I killed a woodlouse. I accidentally squished it and out flooded dozens of infinitesimal babies. I wanted to die.
morbidquestions,fc4sluq,t1_fc4siiy,1577426866.0,Me too. I've seen plenty of human death but the moment an animal even whimpers in pain I have to bail. I find it more difficult to watch animal rescue videos than human execution videos.
morbidquestions,fc4sg7h,t1_fc4p1g1,1577426700.0,It must have been right when it was put up because I distinctly remember reading about him in the news later and realising it was the same guy. I'm only glad I never saw any of the kitten videos.
morbidquestions,fc4mupo,t3_efxcp6,1577421396.0,Luka Magnotta's video of the dismemberment and molestation of Jun Lin. I was kicking around some random gore sites several years ago and found it. At first I thought it was a snuff film but then something just felt off and I slowly realised it was real.
fatpeoplestories,fc4mcwq,t1_fc428xk,1577420953.0,I read somewhere that some hospitals have deals with local zoos to use their equipment for when a large person won't fit in the hospital MRIs and such.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fc4l3xc,t3_eg1wqh,1577419855.0,"Old lady cashiers are the worst. I'd do all my candy/cookie/chip/soda pop shopping separately from my normal grocery shopping and inevitably the cashier would comment. Like, shut the fuck up and let me have my junk food in peace."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fbtt4uz,t1_fbtbaly,1577094447.0,"It's so upsetting to live in Alberta and have this be the reputation but it's true. My little brother is adopted and a quarter black so he passes for many ethnicities except for caucasian. Most people assume he's Native and the bigotry we get because of it is ridiculous. 
During picture day last year at his school we noticed he was pushed to the side with the other ethnic children while all the white kids were in the centre. We thought it was a fluke but it happened this year too. My niece's class has one black girl and she was placed right against the blackboard in the back and you could barely see her. We complained but the school maintains they see no evidence of racism. I'm really worried about how my brother will be treated growing up here."
