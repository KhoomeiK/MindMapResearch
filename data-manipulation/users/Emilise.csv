CPTSD,ff64osa,t3_erttxk,1579619052.0,"I feel you.

I still feel like I fail all the time because I simply can't do the full time job thing and whenever I have tried I always burned out within a year or sooner depending on the type of job. I am practising mindfulness (during the work day, to stay connected to my body and relieve my anxiety) and learning how to properly take care of myself through food, exercise, the overall basics. It's a journey and one thing that never helps is beating yourself up over something that isn't your fault. <3

The fact that you're getting physically ill means your overstepping your own boundaries. I'm glad you didn't go to work today! Take some more days to complement that vacation and find some things to do that will actually help you relax and even give you energy - reading, a walk in nature, anything. You deserve it <3"

Are you in any kind of therapy? Sounds like you might benefit from some help processing all the thoughts and feelings that accompany those dreadful memories. Otherwise you'll get stuck reliving the same thing over and over and you don't deserve that! <3"

CPTSD,fejuec1,t3_epfhj2,1579186075.0,"I felt quite the same way. I just invited a few friends over for dinner and did a tapas style kind of thing where everyone could bring some small items to eat. It was calm and fun and they didn't mind that there was no alcohol (two of them went clubbing afterwards but that was late at night so it was absolutely fine).

Just think of a way that would suit you and celebrate however you'd like! I've once, I think at 22, even thrown a kids birthday party for myself and invited friends and we did typical games from our childhood. It was a nice way to do those games that I didn't really get to enjoy doing back when I was a kid. My friends had a blast and enjoyed making a necklace out of candy the most :)"

CPTSD,fejkhc9,t3_epf7mr,1579177916.0,"I feel you. 

What helps me (and/or helped me in the past); drinking herbal teas in the evening, a ritual before sleeping (taking some time to stretch, listen to relaxing music, thinking of things I'm grateful for), looking at r/houseplants (no triggers plus everybody is so happy for each other) if I can't sleep, cuddle with a giant stuffed animal. I sometimes listen to an audiobook before sleeping as it focusses my thoughts completely on that, but it depends on the book if it's helpful or triggering.

Whenever I do have nightmares, I make sure to take extra breaks (just go to the toilet) to do a mindfulness/relaxation exercise. 
When I'm at home I just watch some uplifting videos or series or whatever (I love watching Great Bakeoff shows and sometimes Graham Norton, or sitcoms like HIMYM or friends)."

Are you in any kind of therapy? Sounds like you might benefit from some help processing all the thoughts and feelings that accompany those dreadful memories. Otherwise you'll get stuck reliving the same thing over and over and you don't deserve that! <3"

CPTSD,fejuec1,t3_epfhj2,1579186075.0,"I felt quite the same way. I just invited a few friends over for dinner and did a tapas style kind of thing where everyone could bring some small items to eat. It was calm and fun and they didn't mind that there was no alcohol (two of them went clubbing afterwards but that was late at night so it was absolutely fine).

Just think of a way that would suit you and celebrate however you'd like! I've once, I think at 22, even thrown a kids birthday party for myself and invited friends and we did typical games from our childhood. It was a nice way to do those games that I didn't really get to enjoy doing back when I was a kid. My friends had a blast and enjoyed making a necklace out of candy the most :)"

CPTSD,fejkhc9,t3_epf7mr,1579177916.0,"I feel you. 

What helps me (and/or helped me in the past); drinking herbal teas in the evening, a ritual before sleeping (taking some time to stretch, listen to relaxing music, thinking of things I'm grateful for), looking at r/houseplants (no triggers plus everybody is so happy for each other) if I can't sleep, cuddle with a giant stuffed animal. I sometimes listen to an audiobook before sleeping as it focusses my thoughts completely on that, but it depends on the book if it's helpful or triggering.

Whenever I do have nightmares, I make sure to take extra breaks (just go to the toilet) to do a mindfulness/relaxation exercise. 
When I'm at home I just watch some uplifting videos or series or whatever (I love watching Great Bakeoff shows and sometimes Graham Norton, or sitcoms like HIMYM or friends)."
