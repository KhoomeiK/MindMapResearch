italy,ff5q3dy,t3_erqi2d,1579605584.0,"Hi, some advice from an immigrant :) If you are not self-sufficient, make sure you live near to where you can find work. There's nothing worse than spending hours in the car or on the train getting to where you need to go. I know that Romans on average spend about 250 hours per year in traffic and they are probably only going a few miles! Just a thought ;-)

italy,ff5pz6j,t1_ff5lm6s,1579605425.0,"That's not completely true. It depends what car you want. If you're going to buy new, automatic is becoming the norm because it's getting cheaper.

If you buy second hand, they might be more difficult to find."

And the fact that someone's tent was removed without even being checked first is horrendous. Don't the trash people have two brain cells to rub together?"
AskReddit,fej8bq1,t1_fej87mk,1579161224.0,"I see that now, maybe it didn't like the source I was using when trying to post it. I posted the link, then a few hours later they removed it (regardless of where I tried to post it). Never mind."

PleX,fedqxts,t1_fedn1ax,1579017975.0,"no, not really other than what you already tried ;-)  I'm a fan of NoMachine as well. If you are new to Linux, and want something easy to install that works, it pretty much ticks all the boxes. x2go is a derivative of NoMachine's old protocol, but you might find it doesn't offer the same things."
sysadmin,fed03as,t3_eo6q3s,1578991978.0,How is this even legal? It's called blackmail.
PleX,feczxby,t1_fe9mq9a,1578991751.0,"If you want something out-of-the-box, x2go might not be for you."
sysadmin,fe6s6ep,t1_fdwji6u,1578902879.0,As a developer myself I don't find NoMachine clunky or laggy at all. It's a powerful piece of software and was built on and for Linux. One of the few that were/are. The fact it's free makes it even more attractive.

selfhosted,fcjq2dz,t1_fc4hmgi,1577698898.0,"No, that is incorrect. X2go is a fork of NoMachine's legacy NX software.
