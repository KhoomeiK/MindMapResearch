AmItheAsshole,ffhmswb,t3_eti13j,1579942842.0,A vasectomy is not a surgery. It's an outpatient procedure. Your logic and research are both wrong. YTA.
AmItheAsshole,ffgfx4u,t3_etguwh,1579905334.0,I am so happy to hear this.
ChronicPain,fffssk2,t1_fffhvnm,1579891018.0,"My brother told me once that he had a higher pain tolerance than my mother and I. We have both had migraines since our teens (so for 31 years for me, 60-plus years for her), survived multiple surgeries, & live w chronic pain. I was so dumbfounded I didn't manage to say, 'OR MAYBE YOU'RE NOT IN AS MUCH PAIN, JACKASS.'"
NewOrleans,fffaeia,t3_etbcfk,1579879606.0,Thank you for the update and for helping these dogs.
NewOrleans,ffdx09d,t1_ffduvof,1579831021.0,They do get overwhelmed sometimes/often. It might be worth reaching out again. They've been very helpful to me in similar situations.
NewOrleans,ffdtaxz,t1_ffdp9ud,1579828394.0,"Yes, but they're awfully good at getting agencies motivated."
ChronicPain,ffdnl77,t3_esxbb4,1579824694.0,"I used to force myself to hang out with my (now deceased) best friend's friend group. My friend was a wonderful person. Her friend group was largely made up of people who didn't like me and didn't like our friendship, which was awkward, to say the least. We lived in New Orleans and went to a lot of second-lines (parades). I was on a walker for years, and still walk with a cane, and often needed (need) to stop and rest: which is a normal human need. I gave up trying to hang with that crowd after one of her friends literally stomped her feet and threw a hissy fit because my friend and I had sat down on a bench for all of  90 seconds (which wasn't nearly enough rest time for me). In retrospect, I wish I'd stood up for myself, but I felt so ashamed for taking up space that I got up and tried to walk through the pain. I wouldn't do that nowadays."
NewOrleans,ffdcaub,t3_esz41e,1579817840.0,Have you contacted Villalobos?
AmItheAsshole,ffdc8ae,t3_esxj8k,1579817794.0,NTA. You're a fucking hero.
aspergers_dating,ffcnbl5,t1_ffcilqv,1579803104.0,This.
MaliciousCompliance,ff9pc5w,t1_ff9m1ut,1579717912.0,"If you wear a kilt to work and knit, please post pictures. You'll make this descendant of Scots very very happy."
personalfinance,ff9p8rg,t3_er5qj8,1579717843.0,Thank you for this. Just moved my savings into the 360 account.
MaliciousCompliance,ff9kmgo,t1_ff9gwl9,1579714996.0,"If anyone gives you shit, let them know that Scotsmen used to knit, in their kilts, w their swords ready, during their down time on the battlefield. That should shut them up."
Whatisthis,ff9ae8e,t1_ff95keb,1579708486.0,Came here to say this.
AmItheButtface,ff8nl96,t3_es5k5w,1579687570.0,"NTB. You did a kind and generous thing, and it sounds like it was received ungraciously. That's on the recipients, not you."
ChronicPainPlayhouse,ff6m5au,t3_ery8kf,1579630141.0,"This is why I am living in a state of near-total stress as I'm trying to plan to leave a state where I was assaulted, had 5 people shot in front of my house, and have lost every person I love to cancer - but I do have a pain management doctor; and move to a state where I can drink the water, live safely, breathe cleaner air - but I might not be able to get my pain treated.

I have cried about this daily for the last eight months. I feel like a prisoner in my body already. Feeling like I have to live in a place where I don't want to live bc of this trumped-up epidemic is almost too much to bear. 

I'm sure I'm not the only one who's been called a junkie by multiple pharmacists. I don't abuse meds. I don't share meds. I just want to live a vestige of the life I used to have. I just want treatment. I just want not to be judged for what happened to my body. I hate it. I do anything to live without this pain. That's all I'm asking for. That's all we are all asking for.

*edit: I would do anything to live without this pain."
