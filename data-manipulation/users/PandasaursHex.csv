A ski boot should fit you perfectly, no wiggle room, but no pain, when you flex your toes and ankles, you want the boot to flex, providing efficient transfer of energy from your skeleton to the boot to the ski.

age, weight,  gender (yes, it  matters, women die of heart attacks, and men die of, well, dumb), etc... and this is for your information.

But if you answer YES to the below when you get nausea (or any grouping of these together at any time)   call **911 or go to the ER**.  ( *I do emergency pre-hospital medicine* and we don't like to mess around when it might be a heart ).

* Irregular heart beat
* Shortness of breath
* Chest pressure, pain, or discomfort.
* Generally not feeling well.
* Dizziness? Fainting? Tunnel vision?
* Inability to stand or walk, sudden loss of balance?
* Does your arm hurt (left or right)? Does your hair (scalp) hurt.
* Do you have a cardiac history?
* Smoke? Diabetes? Drink?
* Does your family have a cardiac history?

You do actually have a nerve that goes from your head to your guts. [The vagus nerve!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve)  It's a nerve we've had since we were fish (If I remember my evolutionary biology). It's attached to our organs and it provides parasympathetic communications to your body (all the way down to your transverse colon). It's a very old nerve system in biology.  It's your 10th cranial nerve.  It helps regulate your heart rate and all sorts of things. (vagus == wanderer, i think) 

When you press on this nerve by bearing down with your abdominal muscle (sneeze, pooping, birth, cough, ice bucket challenge, etc) you change the function of the vagus nerve, you change the communications, you can kinda modulate this signal. 

It's a trick we use to help cardio-vert Pt's in atrial fibrillation (a-fib). It's also why men (not really women) pass out, especially when they see blood, or needles, or poop too hard! 

([vasovagal syncope](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470277/)) 

Now here's where I am concerned for you. ( I do emergency pre-hospital medicine )

Unexplained nausea fixed by bearing down can be a subtle sign of cardiac distress, especially in women. One of the reasons women's heart disease goes unnoticed is that they get more subtle signs and symptoms and they also get different ones than men. 

[https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/warning-signs-of-a-heart-attack/heart-attack-symptoms-in-women](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/warning-signs-of-a-heart-attack/heart-attack-symptoms-in-women)

Are you experiencing any other **cardiac** signs and symptoms during each episode:

* Irregular heart beat
* Shortness of breath
* Chest pressure, pain, or discomfort.
* Generally not feeling well. 
* Dizziness? Fainting? Tunnel vision? 
* Inability to stand or walk, sudden loss of balance?
* Does your arm hurt (left or right)? Does your hair (scalp) hurt.
* Do you have a cardiac history? 
* Smoke? Diabetes? Drink? 
* Does your family have a cardiac history?

**If you experience any of the above when you have an episode, call 911.  M**edics can run a 12-lead, your insurance should cover. (and they don't mind coming to check, and will tell you if you are good to go or need to be transported). **DON'T MESS WITH YOU HEART.** 

TIME == HEART TISSUE == LIFE. 

But, it *could also NOT* be your heart. (The  body is very complicated). 

You really  need  to see a Dr, so they can do an exam, and run some tests. 

(I can't even touch your pulse). 

**Other things to ask yourself?**

* If female, are you or could you be pregnant? (not cardiac related, clearly)
* Have you been sick? running a fever?  
* Are you staying hydrated.
* What activities are you doing when the episodes happen (other than sleeping or being hungry )
* Any major life changes? 
* Allergies, medications, new medications? 
* Drink a lot? 
* Ulcers? 
* Tummy bug?

**Things to track.**

* When does it happen, does it come on rapidly or slowly?
* What makes it worse (and bearing down makes it better?)
* Does it feel like normal nausea?
* Does the nausea go anywhere?
* How intense is your experience. 
* How long does each last? Does it come and go in waves?  What's the timing?

Your wound looks like it is healing, but you also appear to have gotten an infection under your skin. If it's getting better, then you are most likely in the clear. 

Generally do not use topical ointments on the wound (around is fine). Fresh air and keep it clean. Normal non-irritating soap. Don't bother with anti bacterial soap, as all soap is anti-bacterial.  (Soap literally tears the skin off bacteria at the molecular level, NEAT!)

Watch that red ring in your skin for changes or growth. (You'll know). Also be vigilant for fever and aches (which can mean a lot, really).  

Ticks, like any insect, can be vectors for a wider range of diseases.  But your healthy immune system is usually enough to keep such infections at bay, If you are immuno compromised or are undergoing treatment for cancer or HIV then you will probably wanna go see your Dr anyhow.

If you feel sick, or just are concerned, go see your Dr.  (that icky, I don't feel great feeling, and have no go juice == general malaise ). 

Ticks are mandatory parasites (attracted to odor, heat, CO2) and their primary attraction is heat. You can do fun experiments with ticks and heat and guiding them around with heat) The sensory organ they use is called Haller's organ. They also respire through their abdomens, so you can remove (alive) one by covering it with heavy petroleum jelly, or honey.  (See link from u/reldra )

If anything gets worse, or just doesn't feel right. Go see your PCP or urgent care clinic.

Feel better, Cheers
