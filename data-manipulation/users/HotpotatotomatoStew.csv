She told me I looked sexy as fuck, I was flattered, so we went out to some bars while my man bun was up. I oiled up my beard and received more female attention that night than I ever have in a night out.

stopdrinking,fef16ho,t3_eoqhew,1579045752.0,"They say relapse is part of recovery. That's what enabled me to relapse 4 times in my first year. Each one of those relapses came with a pain much stronger than when I made the decision to quit. Quitting motivated me. Relapse made me feel completely out of control. After the last relapse, I couldn't stop thinking about how I'd be a year along had I not relapsed. 

That's just my experience with it. In hindsight, the relapses were horribly painful and long-term depression came along with them. Best of luck to you. I'm sure you know the right decision to make. IWNDWYT."
Showerthoughts,fedzegj,t1_fedcrkd,1579023107.0,"Not necessarily, swainsonine poisoning inhibits metabolism of glycoproteins which causes you to starve even if eating adequately. So the poisoning leaves you with less than enough food for the rest of your life."

stopdrinking,fdqhwwx,t3_emr5sp,1578667092.0,"I relapsed 4 times over the course of my first year attempting to quit. For a long time, I beat myself up thinking I'd be a lot farther along had I not relapsed in that first year so many times. You know what happened in that first year, though? A lot of self discovery and development of life goals.

My point is that even if you relapse, nobody can take the time that you were sober away from you, which means nobody can take that growth from you. It's hard not to beat yourself up but that's self-abuse and it will not help you with your mission. IWNDWYT. Best of luck to you."
