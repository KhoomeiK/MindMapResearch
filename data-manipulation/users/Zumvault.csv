AskReddit,fdfg6jx,t3_eku2yp,1578360941.0,"Identify the cause of the stress.

For me I only stress when I'm worried about something.

Identify possible solutions to eliminate, mitigate, or otherwise reduce cause of stress.

So I try not to worry, more specifically if I'm worried about losing my job then possible solutions can be on either side of the equation. 

So I can do things to try and cement my position, appease my bosses, improve my performance, exceed expectations, outperform anyone in a similar position, take on more responsibility, etc.

Or I can remove the source of stress by quitting my job. 

Or I can start preparing for losing my job by looking for a new one, being more frugal to save money so I have a cushion, etc.

Or on the other side of the equation I can focus on the worrying instead of the causes. So I can focus on evaluating the value of worrying, does worrying accomplish anything? If yes, what? If no, then no point to it so stop.

For some people I understand that being aware of the pointlessness of worrying may not be enough to stop but for me it works.

When I'm worrying I always ask myself ""Can you do anything about it?"" If the answer is yes then I do it and stop worrying. If the answer is no then worrying isn't doing me any good so I stop.

Perhaps a big factor that allows this to work is over the years due to unfortunate circumstances and poor foresight I'm very well practised in adapting to unforseen, and usually negative, circumstances.

Every time something has gone wrong, poorly, or unexpecedly shitty in my life I've survived it, learned from it, and usually have been able to utilize what I learned from it in my favor. So whether I worry or not ""What will happen, will happen."" and I'll survive it or die trying so no sense in worrying about it, best to save that energy to deal with whatever happens after."

When you're older you've encountered most of this shit so auto-pilot runs smooth as hell and you don't have to consciously do much if anything.

That mental engagement as a kid causes you to create many many many memories and as you get older you tend to only notice new things and create less memories because you aren't as consciously aware of things or they're just too common or mundane to create a memory.

AskReddit,fcqyhz0,t3_eii204,1577894118.0,"Change is difficult by itself and it's especially difficult when you're making a big change suddenly.

A part of what can really put people off it is making a change that is easily observable because you know people are going to ask about it, you know you're going to draw attention.

New Year's in particular serves many purposes and goes a long ways towards making it easier on you.

The key thing is that we as a society have designated one day in particular where we expect to see people looking different, acting different, and going to different places. We also all tend to help each other out where we can.

Whether it's a new hairstyle, new clothing style, a change in habits, a new food or workout regime, everybody is doing something new so it's easy to find inspiration, solidarity, or help.

And it's also a great time to meet new people and make new friends because everyone by changing something is admitting weakness or showing some degree of vulnerability so they're more prone to be helpful and kind.

If you're a gym goer or a fan of some kind of group activity you can likely expect to see a bunch of new faces and an absence of old ones starting today and continuing for the next few weeks, months, or years.

The best thing about New Years is you aren't alone in wanting to change something, people all around you whether they're directly involved in your life or not are changing something too, whatever you choose to change this year remind yourself why you want to change it every night before bed, think of ways it will benefit you and start off the day right by making some small step towards that change as soon as you get out of bed when, in my opinion, it's the hardest time to do anything. A couple leaning push-ups off the wall, a short stretch, a few deep breaths, etc. Whatever you're changing this year making a little bit of progress towards it first thing in the morning really sets the tone for the day, you've already started so why stop?"
