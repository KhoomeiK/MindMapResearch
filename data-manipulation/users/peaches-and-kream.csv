insaneparents,fc6t8a7,t1_fc6scnt,1577488890.0,"When you’re kid is a senior in high school she’ll have to ask permission to go to the bathroom. But now that you’re kid is an 18, an adult, and most often still in high school, your kid can foot the bill because she had good influences and she had good parents. Lol. You’re not a good parent. Your robbing her youth. Your making her hate you. You’re not instilling anything other than your skewed idea of what society wants of your daughter to be. You can’t even use proper grammar or spelling. You’re an idiot. A truly incompetent and irrational person. I haven’t even been reading your garbage. Go spend time with your perfect daughter instead of fighting me on reddit. You’re fucking stuck in the past and have zero empathy... the only thing that really matters in society. FUCK OFF PUSSY"
insaneparents,fc6rs0q,t1_fc6qe1h,1577487827.0,Maybe you could go to therapy to learn about empathy. And that being 18 doesn’t make you financially stable. You fucking incompetent pussy ass bitch.

I’m right. You just don’t want to admit it. You’re spewing bullshit in all directions but fail to remain focused on the subject matter. Guess you know everything. Guess your daughter will be fine. Guess you won’t stop commenting because you’re a too busy ignoring your kids to fight with me. Guess you will remember this when your daughter hates the fuck out of you.

Youre belligerent to a girl you’ve never met on the internet. Must have struck a nerve. I can’t imagine what your daughter actually has to go through on a daily basis. 

Here’s to your daughter fucking her way to the top, her hating your disgusting personality, and eventually leaving you. Like you said, she’s “SMART”. And a smart girl knows your attitude towards money and ethics is garbage. Good luck!! Truly. You will need it."

insaneparents,fc3t150,t1_fc3s2ax,1577397886.0,"Dude. I’m 27, have paid my own way since high school, went to college while working full time and paid rent, now make a decent wage, and  I STILL BELIEVE YOU ARE A PIECE OF SHIT. Your daughter hates you. I promise. My dad had the exact attitude as you. He even calls me Kiddo. And now my dad just had Christmas alone. 

When your daughter 23-25, she’ll end her relationship with you, at least temporarily. Not only that, she’ll probably only be with guys who have lots of money and can take care of her, completely negating whatever lesson you are attempting to instill. She might even get a sugar daddy to help her with college debt. All thanks to you!!! And when that day comes I hope you think of this post and the girl who warned about the daughter you are creating. Not to mention...... how do you think girls end up on the pole? Or sell drugs? Or date guys who sell drugs? It’s because of dads who make their daughters so insecure about income."

insaneparents,fc3qxvk,t1_fc3od8h,1577396389.0,I promise your son hates you. And probably will end his relationship with you before he’s 20. Also.... don’t brag about being an ass of a parent. Doesn’t make you or your kid look strong nor does it perpetuate whatever hardship empathy you’re looking for. You just seem like an ass. You’re the type of parent I wouldn’t send my kids to play with. And your son suffers because other parents probably feel the same. Why don’t you get another job and pull YOUR weight as a parent. You know.... like you’re supposed to.... provide for your OWN FUCKING KIDS.
