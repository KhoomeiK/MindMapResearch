tifu,ff096xw,t3_eqxnrk,1579466559.0,"Honestly, you sound like a really cool guy. It's great that you called your female supervisor to finish the shakedown after you realized your mistake, most dudes would just brush it off or blame the girl for wearing baggy clothes."

AskReddit,fevdlqg,t1_fevauex,1579396195.0,"It's really not. No one is forcing you to indulge in porn if it makes you uncomfortable. Also, it's been proven that porn (and legalizing prostitution, too.) helps to greatly reduce incidents of sexual violence. It's sad but sexual pleasure is a very tangible and legitimate need for a lot of people, especially those going through puberty when hormones are on steroids. In a perfect world we wouldn't need porn to prevent people from raping each other, but for now I'm glad people have a reliable and safe way to get off."
AskReddit,fev9cwr,t1_fev7qyu,1579394689.0,"I think it's completely reasonable for someone to complain about getting abused and taken advantage of regardless of the context of the situation and how people make their money should not absolve them of basic respect unless it's illegal or immoral.

And I'll bet money you consume free porn just like most people do, the least you could do is not treat them like subhumans when you're using their service. I say this as someone who is sex repulsed."

Anxiety,fe08oew,t3_en7g7v,1578806114.0,"Honestly, this sounds like more than just anxiety. Possibly ADHD or manic depression, though the latter is less likely without other symptoms.

Listen, I used to experience something very very similar. I still do with mostly everyone. I lived for a long time thinking I wasn't capable of maintaining friendships and that i'd *rather* be alone. About 9 or so months ago I met 3 on the internet who changed my life and we all went to see each other in NY and it was shockingly fun despite the grimy neighborhood the hotel was in and the blistering heat and anxiety from all the activity. 

I can't even explain to you what it is about them, but they work with me and support my needs and respect my boundaries. They're the first people besides my immediate family that I feel comfortable being around almost constantly, even if we're doing our own thing. Sometimes it takes someone really special to get through to you and it's okay if that takes a long time, don't lose hope and don't isolate yourself.

I also wanna mention, one of the most jarring factors of friendships that I didn't know was turning me off to them was the romantic border. I'm on the ace spectrum and it made me feel much more comfortable and safe to be affectionate to my friends while we all understand things are completely platonic and romance isn't an ""upgrade."""

AskReddit,fdzzikb,t3_endd07,1578799516.0,"I've gone both ways so I'm gonna give each a tip:

Men: no means no, if someone says no then back off. stop valuing masculinity over kindness.

Women: no means no, say it when you mean it. communication and honesty is really important.

Both: if you're looking for a long-term relationship and your standards are too high, wait **at least** a year of knowing someone before pursuing a relationship, even if feelings are mutual early on. We're fickle and prone to unpredictable shifts in mindset, and after a year looks are pretty irrelevant."

todayilearned,fdmux2c,t3_em08sd,1578566969.0,"For context, I was in a dark time and did a lot of research on hanging and the consequences of fucking it up. It's designed to drop you from a height and the force of the stop to instantly snap the neck, which causes immediate unconsciousness and the person can peacefully suffocate in their sleep, essentially. If you fuck it up, you asphyxiate while fully aware, as well as supporting the entirety of your body weight with your head which is extremely painful and you will instinctually struggle which causes even more pain and distress.

Intentionally botching an execution is one of the most sadistic, psychopathic things someone can do. Electric chair botches are even worse and i would greatly advise against looking it up unless you have a strong stomach."

Dreams,fdd4wai,t3_eklxr1,1578294920.0,"This reminds me of the Rain World Karma symbols.

The 9th karma symbol, which is one before complete ascension is unlocked, looks exactly like this.
