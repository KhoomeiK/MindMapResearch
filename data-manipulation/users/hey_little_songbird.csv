They start believing vaccins are the bad guys, due to this misinformation. If we can show them why that information is false, if we can show them how much their child would be helped if they were vaccinated, they hopefully would agree to do it.

self,ffes5eg,t3_et8jua,1579862908.0,"First of all: you're lucky you have parents who are concerned about your mental health. Tell them you're thankful they look out for you and want the best for you.

Then, tell them you're in a confusing place right now, puberty. Tell them you're becoming an adult and that you need some time to figure it all out, and that you want to learn who you are as a person. This is something every teenager has to go through (me included), but make sure that you make them feel involved. Even though you want to be alone to get to know who you are, you still love them. You're not a garbage kid - you're going through that phase where someone learns who he or she is, without the influence of their parents. This is very healthy and normal.

Your parents shouldn't be worried about you wanting some alone time - they should be worried if you didn't want to have that. And you, you don't need to be worried that you're weird or garbage - what you're doing is a normal stage in growing up, and a very important one, so make sure you use it to learn more about yourself and to start living your own life a little. You're going to need to figure out where your family stands, where you stand, and that's completely normal. Just tell your parents your thoughts, make sure to tell them you're glad they're involved, and tell them about the puberty thing and this specific stage - I guarantee you they have been through it too, so they shouldn't be worried about your mental health."

offmychest,ffeqoa7,t1_ffeqijo,1579860720.0,"Yes, there is! The gynaecologist is only interested in the medical part - they'll see what's going wrong anatomically.
A sexologist is something between a therapist and a gynaecologist; they too know everything about the body, but they'll also be interested in how your mind perceives sex, if there are problems in your relationship that may cause your dry spell etc. A sexologist tends to be better for these problems since sex usually isn't about the body alone, but also about the mind. A gyneacologist will give you meds to overcome what might be wrong with your hormones, a sexologist will recommend meds, talk to you about how you felt sexually while growing up, give you excercises with your partner, and maybe change the way you see sex. A sexologist looks at the whole picture, so you'll be helped for a lot longer and you won't be dependent on meds alone for your solution."

I don't know if it's medical or psychological, but usually these people can help you. They can offer you therapy and maybe some meds to help you overcome the pain and the bleeding, resulting in you having more physical fun, which will help in how you perceive it mentally. It's hard to keep wanting something that physically hurts, even though you enjoy the intimacy. Maybe the sexologist also can help with your low libido, but I'm almost 100% sure they're going to be able to help with the pain."

AskReddit,ffeptq0,t3_et86td,1579859431.0,"Yes, I got an allowance, my mom was a university teacher and I reread her course text to make sure there weren't any typos in it (800+ pages, once every 3 months). But that allowance was so small (€2 per week, starting from when I was 14) that I couldn't pay for anything except for some sweets at the local shop if I saved for a few weeks. This has helped me to learn how to budget and how to postpone things I'd want to have.

Starting from when I was 17, my parents threatened to kick me out of the house and my allowance changed. I got €25 per week, and if I wanted anything (food, clothes, fees for public transport (which are ridicoulously high here), reeds so I could play the clarinet, etc) I had to pay for it with that money. Luckily, I know how to budget and how to save, so I always could at least save €20 per month. I could never have the fanciest phone, the nicest clothes, I could never buy food whenever I was hungry, I couldn't go to restaurants... So I learned how to look for the cheapest of everything while still upholding a sense of quality, and I learned how important coupons are. I started working (you have to be 17 before you can work here, but then you can only work for 6h a day, 5 days a week), and although I had 3 months of summer vacation, I worked 2 whole months for almost everyday. I earned a lot and saved it all. I don't need that money, I thought, I still have my allowance - this money is going to be needed for emergencies, like when my insurance needs to be paid or I have medical issues.

Right now, I'm in college and I have an allowance of €150 per month to spend on food, activities with the university, public transportation, activities with the choir, whenever I hang out with friends and I also have to pay my therapist from that money. But, I'm good at budgeting, so I can always save at least €70 a month. I'm on a really tight budget and when I see a lot of people here on campus, they clearly aren't. For them, it's normal to eat in a restaurant whenever they're hungry and spend €25 on food alone, telling me ""That's cheap"". When I'm hungry, I usually spend €2,50 maximum. They go buy clothes whenever they feel like it. They message mom and dad to tell them to put more money into their account, while I'm saving.

I think I'm going to be a more responsible adult once I earn money - I'm not spending every cent I have. That responsibility is truly needed in this time, with everything getting more and more expensive for my generation... So yes, my children will get an allowance to learn how to budget, and they are going to work before they earn it.

Edit: grammar

Edit 2: I checked, I save €70 a month now"

Okay, my bad, English isn't my first language"
ratemysinging,ffbe81b,t1_ffa8h6q,1579761530.0,"So, here are a few tips (English isn't my first language, hopefully this is readable!):

* **breathing** place your hands on the back of your midrif. Breath out until you have no more air left and your lungs are completely empty (this can take a while). Take a deep breath, you'll feel how your midrif will expand. Now, slowly breath out on an ""sssssss"" or an ""ffffffffff"", and try to keep your midrif as expanded as in the beginning, for as long as you can. Do this again, but instead of with a long ""s"" or ""f"", now do it with short ""s-f-s-f-s-f-s-f"" etc. Don't breath inbetween them! Think of it as if you're hyperventilating, still trying to keep your midrif as expanded as possible. 
* **posture for standing** (tips from my clarinet teacher) stand up straight, with your hand in an 90° angle to your neck, singing a long suspended note (I don't care which one, as long as you can hold it comfortably for a long time). Make someone stand beside you and push your shoulder (not too strong, you don't need to be on the floor). Their goal is to get you out of balance, but you must keep on standing straight while singing. You'll feel you'll stiffen up some muscles in your lower back. Congratulations! Now you're giving air support. These are the muscles you need to stiffen everytime you sing, it'll make the breathing easier and make the sound better and on tune. I prefer the method of my clarinet teacher since I'm more familiar with that and I can feel better which muscles are needed. When standing, keep your feet below your shoulders, stand up straight and look forward. (tips from my conductor) think of it as if you're pulling a rope, that gets the same muscles involved. Also: do the T-rexflamingo. Go stand on one leg like a flamingo, the other leg in a 90° angle to the ground (as if you're climbing stairs), and keep your arms bended in front of you like you're a T-rex with tiny arms. Sing now. Relax your shoulders, keep standing straight. 
* **posture for sitting** stand in front of your chair, as if you're going to sit down. Sit down, keep your back straight and your head in a 90° angle to your neck. Sing for a while. Now, stand up. Did you need to move your feet/legs/back/whatever before you could stand up? You were sitting wrong then. You need to be able to go stand without adjusting your posture, then you know how you should be sitting. Keep the air support going, even when sitting! In fact, always use air support.
* **high notes** for singing high notes, push the tip of your tongue against the back of your lowercase teeth. This'll make it easier. Also, make your palate as round as possile, and keep it up in the air as high as possible.
* **projection** always sing in the front of your mouth to have natural projection
* **other** Always warm up. Do scales. Don't hurt your voice trying to sing notes out of your range. Don't hurt your voice trying to put pressure on them while performing growls or whatever - this will damage your voice irreparably.

Have fun!"
AmItheAsshole,ffbdehh,t1_ffbaoka,1579760610.0,"Belgium. It's nothing but an ""administrative arrestation"", which basically means that you'll need to tell your side of the story to add to the dossier and that a special judge will determine if you need to be locked up for more than 24h. Usually, after 6 hours or so, you can go home again. It's not a big deal - this only happens when the owner of the shop is fed up with your shennanigans. We do prefer to just ask you to pay for what you ate and we warn you to never try it again. It's basically theft where we live, so the first time we let it slide but we'll warn all the employees so they know they need to look out for you. When you try it a second time, we get the police involved."
