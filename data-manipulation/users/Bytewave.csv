The appeals process is and has to be extraordinary.

Killing inmates results in innocents dying because the level of wrongful convictions have proven frighteningly high even in the best democraties. So it can never be a cost savings measure.

If anything such a structure to override vetos may be more likely to be used against a major country than against a small one.

I'm sitting here with a PolSci masters on my wall and I'm honestly not sure whether it's the case. Political polarization is fascinating to study but not good news for democracy. The group of undecided that may swing both ways is shrinking as a percentage of the electorate and their reasons for doing so are both more unpredictable and further away from what we'd hope them to be. Long gone are the days when informed moderate centrists were a large part of the deciding voice."

AskReddit,fexugr9,t1_fewvs5i,1579436402.0,"The real shit gets stolen and night  in 24/7 grocery stores around here because we forbid alcohol sales at night, likely because of bar owner's lobbies.

It's kinda hard to do anything about it, because the profile of the person who will steal extracts at night at the grocery store is rough. It's alcoholics who are shaking from withdrawals and the like, and acute withdrawal can be lethal. The bottles of extract are basically to stay alive until convenience stores are allowed to sell strong beer at 7am. Some nighttime grocery employees refuse to act on those small scale thefts as a result, or call for ambulances instead of cops despite instructions."
