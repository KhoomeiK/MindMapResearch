A big lab named Lucy who likes to cuddle, a fluffy, shy chihuahua (obviously mixed with another breed but idk what) named Shadow, and two feisty wiener dogs named Bonnie and Clyde.

The first time I met them, they wouldnt let me get anywhere near them, threatening to bite anytime I made a motion towards them. After a few more visits over the years, now they're enjoying their new territory on my lap or curled next to me in the guest bed."
