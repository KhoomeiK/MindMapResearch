What point are you even trying to make? That it's a good thing that they artificially inflate the price of a product by offering the same product that they software blocked at a lower price? 

How is that remotely better for the consumer?"

The thought of suburban divorcees doing gangsta shit but then there's you standing in their way, wagging your finger at them. 


""Nah ah ah, you ain't from the streets. Best stop fucking around with that easy money shit."" 


Also the OP is a female friend of the attempted fraudster."

todayilearned,fgg9vmz,t1_fgg86qh,1580757371.0,"Ya I did it on ibuprofen and Advil when I had 4 wisdom teeth taken out, 2 impacted.

But I worked at a Lumber yard not running around in the army or Marines. 


    My stepdad was forced to get his wisdom teeth taken out in the Marines  so the dentist team could practice I guess? And they promoted him the next day, when you were promoted you had to run ""The Gauntlet"". Where you run through a group of guys who all beat the shit out of you while you run. 


   This was back in the early 90's."
AskReddit,fg7xim5,t3_ex92i4,1580604005.0,"I say California or texas. 

I'm terms of logistics I would think they would have the best shot. 


California already has a state governmental body for every federal government body ( I would also argue they do a better job as it is) and Texas has its on independent power gird and like others have said a lot of them want to anyways."

guns,fg6n36i,t1_fg69fuk,1580572231.0,"The divergent event in the fallout universe from ours is they never invented the transistor but focused on nuclear instead. The whole history is very interesting. 

But NCR, BOS, and the enclave all had varying degrees of manufacturing and production knowledge. 


The enclave the most tech and engineering with the BOS second. 

Enclave made and design new power armour and eyebots. The brotherhood have knowledge and personal but not to the degree of the enclave. The enclave was high ranking military and government personal so they had a benefit of first pick of bases and labs. The BOS was more a loose collection of the rest of the military, lacking in knowledge of what was happening during the Great War and bombings. This resulted in a slower start. 


NCR has lots of manpower but lack training, tech, and engineering (you can see this in how they cant wear power armour but only salvaged power armour that has had the insides removed this only leaving the shell. 


I'm sorry if this runs on, I love fallout lore and currently have the flu and bronchitis."
gundeals,fg4rwwv,t1_fg4maur,1580509762.0,"I rotate this between my Shield gen 1.0, and my M&P9 full size gen 1.0 and I like it a lot. 

Holsters are a lot easier to find, when I bought mine 3 years I couldn't find anything besides gearcraft and Alien.  
I love my gearcraft holster but it was $86 and the Alien hybird 2.0 with neoprene backing was about $35 but it held too much heat against me. 

The gun feels top heavy and is thicker than the M&P but I like the trigger a lot and after I stippled the grip it's a dream to shoot and handle.

Edit- also the Novak box sights really are nicer than stock M&p in my opinion"

They do like 85% of all e commence and still make more money off of their web servers and cloud storage. 

They sell so much they found out it was cheaper to also make their own shipping network. No company has ever implemented their own shipping network just to cut down on costs.  I don't think Amazon is going to be taken down by other competition in their current state or ever."
