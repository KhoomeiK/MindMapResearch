So true. I'm amazed that u/Mikkaelz wrote that he is ""immature and irresponsible"". I know 40 year olds that are immature and irresponsible and they don't even know it!!!

rant,fesewe7,t3_eqcy53,1579364485.0,This has been scientifically proven. There's a book called 'Survival of the Prettiest' that outlines a range of case studies and how attractiveness creates all kinds of perks in life. It's a good read.
SuicideWatch,fesckta,t3_eqg8kz,1579363863.0,"Erg the worst. I'm 36 and my mom still corrects or comments on most things I do when she's around. In some ways I feel sorry for her. When I go home for a visit... she's constantly observing me because she hasn't managed to turn off her 'mom brain' yet. I swear a parents brain gets restructured after years of parenting. After years constantly looking for a teachable moment, a time to educate you, or guide you in some way they just don't know how to be a normal persona anymore. 

It's sad really that most parents never escape it and become an independent person separate from her children, even after their kids have moved away for years and are full fledged grown human adults.  

My suggestion is to try to create more friendship scenarios with them where you are both acting as equal adults. Ultimately they just want attention, like everyone does, and if 90% of their interactions with you are to scold/parent you then that's they only way they know how to interact with you. Best way to break this cycle is to ask them about their teenage or earlier years of before they had kids. It can help them see the similarities between you and themselves and put you on a more equal footing.   
If I treat my mom like a mom she acts like a mom and annoys the crap out of me. If I spend some time listening to her, having a few full conversations, laughing at her jokes, asking about her life, suddenly she starts being more friendly and less judgmental. 

Good luck! If it never goes away... just know that you are NOT alone on parental frustrations..."

MGTOW,feq7y71,t3_eqd8xg,1579338625.0,"\- Start making meals with healthier foods, focus on fruits and vegetables. Basically if you're eating healthy food, it's hard to over eat.  
\- Try meal prepping, it's a great way to open the fridge and end up eating a healthy meal because hey, it's already there.  
\- Next time you grocery shop, only shop the outside section, most things in the isles are less healthy pre-packages items. Just go in for what you really need rather then strolling up and down the isles.  
\- Learn to read product labels. Did you know they purposely don't put the percentage of sugar on labels? It's because it would freak people out. Every 4g is a teaspoon. If you wouldn't eat that many teaspoons of sugar on it's own, look for a healthier version of the same product.  
\- On that note, check out your pantry. If you can afford it, toss/give to friends anything that's pour quality and replace it with more natural products with fewer ingredients and less preservatives.  
\- Drink lots of water and if your currently drink pop, stop. That stuff is absolute trash and filled with spoons and spoons of sugar.  
\- Get a gym buddy or someone who likes being active.  
\- If you haven't already, do some weight training. Muscle burns more calories than fat.

Ultimately it's best to make changes slowly so you don't end up going through withdrawal and binge eating. Over time healthy foods will literally taste better and you'll crave them. If you end up having something ""bad"" avoid the rationalization that since you failed, you can just eat terribly the rest of the day/weekend. That thought process is a trap. Plan  what your treats or cheats will be and you're more likely to stay on track.

Hope that's helpful. I could go on, just let me know."

MaleDatingStrategy,feozu8k,t3_dv1jrm,1579308989.0,"It can be for a lot of reasons, some physical some psychological: 

- Some girls like the power play. If she has to make a lot of decisions in her day to day, it can be nice to let someone take over. 

- They‚Äôve seen it in porn or had a partner do it and now they‚Äôre into it. 

- Light headedness / reduced oxygen is trippy and can intensify orgasms. 

- Women often don‚Äôt orgasm from penetration. Any other stimulus you can provide aids in climax. 

- Women can struggle with getting off or enjoying themselves, by feeling that they have physically lost control of their bodies (forced helplessness) it can allow them to surrender more effectively. 

- Lastly, sometimes it‚Äôs not even about the choking necessarily. Just the sheer force of putting pressure down on a woman‚Äôs chest isolates and holds her in position. Thus every time you thrust the sensation is more aggressive because she‚Äôs not bouncing around on the mattress. AKA jackhammer style.

TrueOffMyChest,feovdu0,t1_feo406z,1579306230.0,"So lucky you have no bully. God it was the worst. Although did make me stronger in the end so... 

Ultimately you are your own life-long cheerleader. You can choose to be nice to yourself or a drill sergeant. I‚Äôm both. I‚Äôll laze around for days feeling terrible then something snaps, I get mad and I get productive. Find what works for you. It‚Äôs an ongoing struggle for sure. 

Now and days I feel blessed to have depression. It makes me not be complacent and just do what everyone else is doing. Use any suicidal episode as a warning, a warning that it‚Äôs time to change something. 

That‚Äôs how I ended up selling everything I owned and backpacking for 2 years. I had too many episodes and had to mix things up. A lot of people dream of having the confidence to do that but would NEVER actually do it. For us, if the alternative is death... well... why not live your dreams fearlessly. You literally have nothing to lose. üòâ"
MGTOW,feomfw2,t3_eq16s7,1579302140.0,Jesus. What‚Äôs wrong with people. It‚Äôs called breaking up. Learn to see the signs that a relationship is over and tap out before you do something stupid and hurt someone. I‚Äôve had several guy friends be cheated on. I hear them share for months about terrible sex or no intimacy from her and then surprise surprise she cheats. Regular and honest check ins with your partner are so important. She should have broke it off.
TrueOffMyChest,feo2xsu,t3_eq2km8,1579294420.0,"Arg, that sentence though... I can relate. Whenever someone commits suicide I have a small wave of jealously that washes over me. ‚ÄúI wish I could do that.‚Äù

I‚Äôve been suicidal since I was 8. Now a 36 year old female. Those thoughts still to this day come at me sometimes but you get better at working through them. 

I made a pact with myself when I was 15 that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to off myself unless I‚Äôd made all efforts to change my life for the better. I‚Äôve been following that rule for the rest of my life.  If things get shady I change something. I do something impulsive (healthy impulsive, not something dangerous). 

Over the years this mentality has given me the power to live my dreams, have confidence, and ultimately do whatever I want. If the alternative is death, why not just do what you want?

I had a bully in middle school. I hated my life and felt helpless. She almost broke me. Instead of ending my suffering I did the one thing I hadn‚Äôt tried yet. I punched her in the face. It worked like a charm and everything at school suddenly changed. 

If there‚Äôs anything I‚Äôve learned over the years it‚Äôs that your entire life can change in 24hrs and you repeatedly have the power to change it. The more you make good decisions the better and better life gets. Stay the course, crush it, and then help others to do the same. 

You got this!!"

Ultimately get your life together regardless of your gender/age. Get a job, explore a passion, go to therapy if you need it, etc. Relationships should be partnerships, a fair exchange. If she's a supportive woman, maybe he opts to take care of her. If they both love working, let them work. Whatever the exchange may be, as long as it's fair based on each parties needs being met, then it's fair. Ultimately just don't EXPECT to be taken care of, that truly is just lazy."
