I major in history and English, and for me history is easier to study, I tend to read faster since it's a funnier subject than English, and I only study when there is an exam close by. I also like to think that I'm studying when watching YouTube videos and such. But when I have my English courses I need to study a lot. Last semester I failed 5/7 exams but completed 7/7 the second try - that was a wake up call and my more recent English semester I had to study every day - but only in school, there is no reason for me to study at home. It dosen't work. But in school I study for like 2 hours efficiently and perhaps 1-3 hours with friends or not so seriously. 
The efficiently has definitely increased over the years. So don't wory about it. The best skill to learn is how to choose what to study and cancel out all the unnecessary stuff. When I just started uni I thought I had to read everything the teacher handed us. Not true. Study smart and don't wory to much about it."

My tip is to make sure to have a lot of lunch and snacks with you, and feel free to buy coffee, sugar or anything to keep you going. 
Good luck."
