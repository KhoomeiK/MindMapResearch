corgi,ffeq9ps,t3_et3jjb,1579860112.0,"My favorite part about this picture is that this statue was given to our vet awhile ago by my grandma. She passed away a couple years ago now, and we actually inherited her 2 - 16 year old Dachshunds (which are still doing well for their age). Luckily, we haven't needed to bring them into the vet too often within the last year, so we haven't been in the vet for awhile. Anyways, the vet and staff all reminded me that my grandma had given them this statue and a couple other things for kitties. She was a great lady!"
