I was lucky to start on PS4 with the new year festival so I've been using the Oolong head in everything. level 3 crit eye with a XL gem slot is ridiculously OP.

My general set is then Oolong head, Rathalos B+ body, and Kulu a+ legs. Gloves and coil are flex spots depending on element/status/defensive skills etc. but I typically went with Clockwork B+ coil for partbreaker and gloves with level 2 element.

I use the Uragaan hammer quite a bit which has a lot of fire element but only blue sharpness so the Rathalos set bonus works quite well (minds eye) and the coil has level 2 fire. The gloves have jump master to round it out. 

If you've not got Oolong, the Odogaron B+ coil has 2x crit eye and XL and S gem slots so can hit that 5x crit eye too as a replacement."

Also my favourite thing to do with the hammer is, when the monster is asleep, to lay down some barrel bombs at its body, then do the stationary level 3 charge smash at the head straight into clutch claw straight into a wallbanger. The bombs will go off while you're on the monsters face so you get the wake up bonus on your giant smash, the bomb explosions AND a 2% wall hit.

ffxiv,fdq6jh5,t3_emlp1c,1578657035.0,"Each expansion has three Raid tiers, with each tier spanning roughly 30 item levels. At 5.0 the best gear you could get was the trial weapon and accessories at i450, then a full set of Ronkan at i440, with artifact gear just behind at i430. 5.01 brought the first raid tier's normal mode which meant you could collect a full set of i450 gear for the first time. You could mix and match with the innocent accessories to get the best set of substats for your class.

5.05 brought the Savage versions of the raid, which are significantly harder, along with three new sets of gear at i450 (Facet), i460 (Deepshadow), and i470 (Edengrace).  Facet gear is crafted and can be overmelded. Armour typically only ever has two materia slots but the crafted set at each tier can be melded up to five times. This process is heavily RNG-dependent as each bonus slot is harder to meld than the last. Trying to slot a materia VII into the final slot has only a 7% success rate. As this armour is available immediately it is the best you can get to challenge the Savage raids for day 1, and is better than some of the i460 gear because of the available substats when pentamelded.

Deepshadow at i460 is the next most available gear but restricted by the cap of 450 per week on phantasmagoria tomes. These tomes were also released this patch. It can be upgraded to i470 but only using an item gained from the Savage raids.

Finally, the raids themselves drop the Edengrace gear directly and via tokens, with an i475 weapon from the final boss. Thus there are two sets of gear at i470, offering different sets of substats. Each class has different priorities and so must pick the best options for their maximum dps. (As an example, BLM wants ALL the spell speed, but RDM would much prefer no SpS at all).

5.1 drops a spanner in the works for those not fully geared, as you can now upgrade your Facet gear to i460 (but it can no longer be overmelded), and get alliance raid gear also at i460, as well as a trial wepaon at i465. This is also great for gearing up alt classes quickly, although less relevant in this expansion as savage gear is dropped in coffers instead of directly.

After all of that, in \~6 weeks 5.2 will come along and we start the pattern all over again. We'll get the new normal raids giving i480, new craftable overmeldable i480, i490 tome gear upgradable to i500 with a savage raid item, and savage raid i500 with a i505 weapon."
