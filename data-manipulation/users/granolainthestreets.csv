He has them every other weekend too, if it suits him, which does help, but he does exactly zero parenting. I get them back on Sunday, court ordered, so that I can get them ready for school the next day, because he can’t function well enough for things like homework and baths. The precious 4 or 5 nights off a month enabled me to work late, and even, eventually, date a little. But it is still, legally, all on me, so....I still think I am a single parent, AND a solo one.

I even have to get their homework done when I get them back, because he “doesn’t do that”. He does pay a very minimal amount of child support, but it doesn’t even cover their food, let alone anything else. So, yeah. Single parent.

You can get a restraining order against someone, even if they didn’t touch you, even if you are married, even if they own the property, if they are harassing you. I have done this. Just stay calm and state what you want. You allowed him to see the kid at your home, that is more than is even legally required, so it won’t be a problem for the future, in court."

SingleParents,ffc18hf,t3_esm4j4,1579788957.0,"Do you text him this information, like about who to call and set up supervised visitation, or when it might work?  Because if you have ever texted him any of those things, simply take a screenshot of that Convo, and then save it in an album. You can just email that file to a lawyer, if and when he ever takes you to court.

If he hasn’t stepped up and done any of the things he was supposed to, the court isn’t going to hold you liable for anything. In addition, if visitation is when and where you say,  then it is 100% up to you. If you demanded that he only visit the kid at the mall wearing a purple gorilla suit, then legally that is what he has to do.


One thing to do though, is make sure the kid has memorized your phone number. I don’t know how old he is, but some really casual conversations about how to escape from kidnapping in general would be good prevention, just in case the deadbeat dad ever tries to swipe him from school or something. My kids made a plan, that if their dad tried to take them out of state, then they were going to have to go to the bathroom at the next gas station, and while one distracted him in the bathroom the other would ask for help from the person behind the counter. They pay close attention to maps and exits and highways too, so that they would know when they were actually over state lines. Fortunately, it never became an issue, but it was a very real possibility, and they were prepared."

EatCheapAndHealthy,ff84o3n,t3_es2u5d,1579665896.0,"Black beans, buy them dry they are very cheap. Soak overnight, then drain the water and put in the crockpot the next morning. Cover with water, an inch above the beans at least, add salt, cook in crockpot all day. I like to add a bay leaf and some dry mustard powder (that helps with digestion). 

No matter what time you come home, there is a hot meal waiting. Ladle into a bowl, sprinkle with cheese, and have some chips and salsa on the side. That was meal 1.

Turn the crockpot on the lowest setting and put the lid on. Ready for tomorrow.

Meal 2: Cook some rice. I like using a rice cooker just because then I don’t have to think about it. 
Cut up some things like avocado and green onions, maybe chop some cilantro and squeeze lemon juice over it. Layer the rice, beans, chopped veggies and maybe cheese or sour cream. Poof! Meal 2.

Meal 3: drain the leftover beans and rinse them. Rinse out the crockpot, and put in some chicken tenders or a chicken breast. Dump in a small can of corn, a small can of canned tomatoes, and the black beans, leftover green onions and cilantro, garlic, and spices. Cook on low all day. When you get home, throw in half a block of cream cheese. Get the leftover rice out of the refrigerator and ladle “Magic Chicken” over it. Voila!

I won safety, peace, a good life, legal protection, and the right to make decisions for my kids without his manipulations. The courts upheld justice more or less. Whatever he tells people, all I have to do when they ask me is say that I have full custody and a lifetime restraining order against him and their mouths drop open and then....they know."
NarcissisticAbuse,ff22zez,t3_er59sy,1579492398.0,"I won! I mean, kind of. My Nex denied all the abuse that he did, making it out to be all my fault, of course. Loads of projection and blame shifting. In fact, that is how I kept track of what he was actually doing: whatever new crazy thing he was accusing me of doing. But I got an order of protection, and he behaved so terribly to the police that came to serve and enforce it that they told me several times thereafter that they were “not fans”, and they were always very helpful to me when I needed help to wiggle out of his manipulations, of which there were many.

Nex lied so outrageously in court that his fake evidence was thrown out or refused many times, and my final divorce decree actually states: “father’s testimony was not found to be credible” in multiple places. My lawyer told me months later that the judge was still laughing about some of his bizarre accusations and lies. “She is dating an actual demon! Everyone knows that people from that town are not real, they are demons. I am afraid the demons are going to steal my children from her house because she is friends with one of them!” 

Nex tried to get full custody, saying I was a danger to the children. But his treatment of the children was so terrible the judge reprimanded him sternly from the bench, multiple times, and gave him firm ultimatums. 

I got full custody, he got limited visitation. He contested it and took me back to court. Dutifully, I presented all the evidence of the ways that he had violated specific court orders, just in three months’ time between the two court appearances. Each of the children’s three counselors testified, and they each agreed on very specific details about his behavior, without ever talking to each other about it. He and his mom made up crazy parallel stories, to “explain away” the incidents, but nobody took either of them seriously. 

They took some of his visitation away, shortening his time. He took me back to court. The court  took more time away and I suspect his lawyer told him to quit already. 

Nex now gets to see the kids a total of six nights a month, and every other holiday. Due to court ordered therapy and medication, he has actually gotten a little more stable. The kids do not dread their time with him nearly as much, and even enjoy it. Honestly, I really treasure getting a little break from them, now that I know they are usually having fun while with him. 

He declares that he is gathering evidence against me, to prove my false accusations wrong and “get his kids back”. But the youngest is 10 now, so pretty soon it will be a moot point. We have court ordered mediation, which is a cruel joke, but it ends up just showing his true colors to a mandated reporter. The kids know there is power in telling the truth. They are safe, and they know their community stands behind them.

NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fegrqei,t3_eoblih,1579100995.0,"Definitely contact a domestic violence center, they will listen to you and give you all the details about what options you have, and what steps to take in whatever you choose.

I got a restraining order and now a forever order of protection, and it was the best thing I EVER did! It was still a very very long hard road through all the custody and court stuff, but worth it. Awful, but worth it."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fegrdv7,t3_eo7b6q,1579100758.0,"Getting yourself stable and healthy is the only way to get “out”, and the best way to help your kids. My ex tried everything to get me to not be able to work, once I got a restraining order, because he thought that if I needed him financially, I would come back. It was actually far, far easier to be without him, because of his foolish spending and his abuse that made it hard for me to function. But because I was solid and stable and, eventually, emotionally healthy, I didn’t have to worry about him as much and could set a good example for the kids. The kids thank me ALL THE TIME for leaving him, actually, they are relieved, as well."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fegqdd1,t3_eo7pil,1579100062.0,"One thing I pay ALOT of attention to is how a potential partner/date talks about their exes. If they were all “crazy”, I’m like, “Hmmmm....who is the common denominator here?”   

The guy I have been dating for the last year mentioned his exes kindly and briefly, and was still casual friends with many of them, although they lived in other places. MUCH later I found out through chance comments by his friends about some crazy behavior by particularly one ex; and still my guy only said, gently, that she had been really struggling at the time. He didn’t even realize I was listening, but that kind of thing goes a long way in showing that he really is the person I experience him to be."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fegph1u,t3_eo7pil,1579099440.0,"I have had great experiences, but I was a mess at first! I had a male friend who kindly helped me get past a lot of my triggers by being caring, willing to hold me if I came apart but also leave me alone/move your arm/don’t mention chicken today/please stand differently it’s scary—-whatever I needed to get past the panic attack triggers. He thought it was fun to help me feel comfortable, and we are still friends today."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fegog9v,t3_ekyfy3,1579098716.0,"Yeah, my Nex is going around our old church and all his new friends, wailing about how I abused him and cheated on him (by casually dating only YEARS after we separated), keep the kids from him, hurt him so that he couldn’t work, etc. It’s all lies and projection, but I get that new people probably believe him.   When I run into old acquaintances, all I have to do is say that I have a restraining order and full custody (very uncommon in this state), but that the small amount of visitation he has is going better, and the kids get to spend 6 evenings with him a month! And he feeds them meals and lets them go to school and even do homework! And I am truly happy about all those things, because we fought tooth and nail in court, even having to specify legally that he provide food when they are with him (he tried to get me to pay him to feed them, for some reason, and he wasn’t even paying child support). 

All it takes when meeting people he has snowed is just saying the truth, with my own true feelings about it (the kids and I are safe! He isn’t doing drugs as much,  I think!), and all of a sudden—-they know.  They realize he was lying. Or, they don’t, and that is their problem not mine! ;-)"

Parenting,fe086mf,t3_enh87j,1578805679.0,"This is super hard. My ex threw giant tantrums about how I “was keeping his kids from him”, and still does, 4 years later, because I wouldn’t cave to his ever-changing, erratic demands. Like, he wanted me to get them out of bed and drive an hour at a moment’s notice to take them to see him at some random druggies’ house where he was staying. (I refused). 

I had a restraining order against him and he wanted me to meet him all kinds of random back-alley or abandoned park places, always at his convenience with no warning. (I refused).

He still wails about that today. I don’t doubt for one second that is the first thing out of his mouth when he meets anyone new, and he has turned a few people against me, but that is their problem. I had to stick up for my kids, and I did. 

I gave him reasonable visitation, he refused most of it. I didn’t cave on all his insanely last-minute changes. We had to court order that he feed them meals at regular intervals, and not remove them from school randomly for no reason. 

It took years, and he still tries to jerk me around, but he tries less. I have full custody, he has limited visitation. I flex a bit on the schedule if he lets me know respectfully and ahead of time, but if he springs things on me or changes it around, we “have plans”. 

The judge told him that his relationship with his kids was his responsibility, and that he had a lot of work to do to make them feel safe. He still lies about me to anyone who can listen, but I just stuck to my guns, spoke up for what was best for the kids, and made it not about what I wanted or about getting even, but about what the children needed and how they could be safe.

I don’t know if that helps, but you have to stand up for yourself and your kid, and if he wants to see his kid, he will cooperate. That is what a judge would tell him, too."
Parenting,fdog541,t3_emddla,1578604465.0,"I do not go to all my children’s events when they are with their dad. I am the primary parent and every moment of my whole life revolves around what they need. On the every other weekend (or less!) That they are with their dad, I generally use that time to work, sleep, or catch up with friends. They know that I am absolutely committed to them, but I think it’s good for them to see me make myself a priority sometimes.

It sounds like you can’t do anything to keep her dad from taking her, but you can certainly choose to care for yourself.  Good luck. I know these things aren’t easy."
