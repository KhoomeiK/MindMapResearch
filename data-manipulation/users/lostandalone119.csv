bipolar,ff7g3r5,t1_ff63b1g,1579648751.0,Same...I can't eat food other people have made unless I actually see them make it....so work potlucks are always super awkward for me because I won't eat anything that my co workers bring in. I always just bring a box of cookies.
bipolar,fewfmf9,t3_eql7g9,1579409788.0,That's really lovley.
AskReddit,fd2j37t,t1_fd0akur,1578147957.0,I'm so sorry that happened to you. I was bullied too and couldnt belive how the teachers just took a blind eye to it...every day was torture until high school..I'm 40 years old now and still carry those scars. I really hope life has been kinder to you since then.
