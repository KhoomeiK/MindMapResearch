""You wouldn't plant a seed and think it was broken because it didn't grow overnight.

Growth tskes time. Give yourself time."""
AskReddit,feldigz,t3_epj100,1579219627.0,"Commandos: Strike Force

Took plave in WW2

To my knowledge it was the Commandos games first foray into non-top-down real-time strategy games.
You controlled a sniper, a green beret, and a spy.

Some missions you had all 3, some you had 2, some you had to do something with one beforr you got the other 2.

You could push a button and change characters immediately. Kill someone as the spy and get spotted by someone else? Hide, switch to sniper, take him out. Boom.

The sniper was , well , a sniper and he had throwing knives etc. The game encouraged you to shoot then move so you wouldn't be found.

The green beret was the typical commando, call of duty style guy.

But the spy was the best. Had a silenced pistol with linited ammo, and a garote. And you could kill german soldiers with ranks including privates, majors, officers, and gestapo. You could take their uniforms, too. Only people of a higher or same rank as you might suspect you. 

Amazing game. Amazing map and mission design. Should have been remastered by now."

insaneparents,fehjoz8,t1_fegv80p,1579117928.0,"Im sorry where do you live exactly that doesn't have free flu shots somewhere? CVS , Walgreens, Rite Aid, most DOCTOR'S OFFICES give it out for free each season. And even not in the US if WE can do free anything, the rest of the (developed) world must be able to, too.

Now if you legitimately aren't thats fair, I'm interested to know where tho"
ClovisCA,fdikrwn,t1_fdif9di,1578445102.0,Thank you so much for your info! I'll message you  now!
ClovisCA,fdhftmz,t1_fdhfo4n,1578421744.0,"Okay Gotcha! Would you day someone with asthma would be okay to live in Clovis, just some extra precautions on low quality days?"
ClovisCA,fdhfhx5,t1_fdhf0g6,1578421551.0,"Thank you for the info!

Quick question for you, when you mention the poor air quality in the summer, how bad is it? Like, China cities bad where you have to wear a mask? Or is it just dustier? Etc."
ClovisCA,fdh9syk,t1_fdh8ucv,1578418472.0,"These are all so wonderful to hear!!! I love the fact that its near things that could be day or weekend trips, not too close that tourism is a huge issue locally or too far that it becomes a once a year thing. 

The fact that valley is great is also amazing. From my research nurses also make more money in california so that helps, as well. And knowing that there are credit unions to transition to is also reassuring.
Long term id like to finish my bachelors and start teaching high school, so idk if you/anyone knows if theres a demand for teachers in Clovis/Fresno or how salaries compare to the national average.

The lack of winter is not a big deal to us, really, as we're trying to escape that dreary gray season lol so thats good news!

And of course the schools being top notch is amazing, it does aound like a great place to raise a family!"
ClovisCA,fdh801w,t1_fdh7aej,1578417359.0,"So to be honest it was due to a niche.com article.

My wife wants sunshine, and we were considering moving to Arizona because its sunny! But i dont think it'll be the best fit for us, so i mentioned california and she said ""i wish!"" Because we thiught it was financially impossible.

I googled affordable places to live in CA, because on the East Coast we all think the rent everywhere is 3K-4K dollars and the cheapest houses are 400 grand, and Clovis popped up!

So I've researched a lot now, about safety, school districts, cost of living, salaries, etc. And it seems REALLY good for us! But I really want more personal, firsthand feedback! :)"
ClovisCA,fdgz5eg,t1_fdgwmyx,1578411843.0,"Also just out of curiosity, what's a gallon of gas cost there?"
ClovisCA,fdgxo91,t1_fdgwmyx,1578410868.0,"Perfect thank you for all the info!

Anything you can tell me about Clovis or CA in general that we in the East might not know already? Maybe something you all overlook everyday as normal that we would notice? Laws, custom, lifestyle, anhthing really"
ClovisCA,fdgvg8j,t1_fdgv5mj,1578409318.0,"This is good to hear! My wifes biggest complaint about coastal virginia is that winter and the end of fall is all gray, cloudy and dreary. She hates it, depresses her.
How's humidity? Our average here I believe is about 70%..."
ClovisCA,fdgu600,t1_fdgu0lz,1578408405.0,"Thanks for the answer!!

Nightlife means nothing to us, we're a quiet family lol. How's the weather throughout the year? Like how often is it sunny, how cold is the winter/hot is the summer? Do you actually get fall/spring or is it just a jump from summer to winter"

cats,fd2by2z,t1_fd2abbn,1578144988.0,"Yo i Know your intentions are good here, educating people for the future, etc. But read your comments and listen to the tone, VERY accusatory and almost victim-shamey. OP just lost a friend, and did what they thought was best with the resources at hand."
AskReddit,fd2azq9,t1_fd0j6z6,1578144528.0,"In a system that offers no affordable or universal healthcare, and most people live paycheck to paycheck, requiring someone to go to Patient First or the Hospital (most doctors dont have same day sick) and spend 25-50 bucks PLUS 3 hours to be told the have a cold is classist.

AskReddit,fbhbhzs,t1_fbgj62k,1576869748.0,"Ive seen it to, and thats the use i see for it. The swt also includes access to 5, 10, etc. Games (yahtzee, etc) on their app, so you can play thkse too rrmotely with people. BUT the DND set, that comes with 5 D6 and ONE D20 is 95$. Im sorry even my closest friends dont wamma pay 100$ each to buy dice so we know Tom's not cheating- Tom's not worth 95$...maybe 25$?"
