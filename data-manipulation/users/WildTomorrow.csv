neoliberal,ffomqgn,t1_ffocajm,1580079268.0,"You're missing my whole point...which is that capitalism is not inherently racist and that racism exists outside of capitalism. Sure, there may be a correlation (not even sure if this is true, because if you look at the far-right white nationalists like Richard Spencer, they're not capitalists), but correlation does not imply causation. They're not racist \*because\* they're capitalist and they're not capitalist \*because\* they're racist.

The fact of the matter is that there are more capitalists in American politics and citizenship than any other economic system; so just by pure math, there's going to be higher probability of racism than any other economic leaning. 

The progressive party in the US (aka not racist) was capitalist and still mostly is, other than a few on the far left side of it, unless you're arguing that the modern-day Democratic Party is also full of racists. In that case I don't know what to tell you.

The worst part is I don't even think he thinks it's a hoax, he just doesn't think it's as serious as it really is.

I think the earlier proponents of climate action are partially to blame though. They made such bold, unrealistic, exaggerated claims about the severity of it so now many people are like ""see those things didn't happen, it's not real."" Obviously this isn't the case, but still, it's sort of understandable that people have been hearing that for 20 years are skeptical. Still not a bad reason to dismiss the science, but more understandable I guess.

Some examples of the insane claims that were made can be found in the article below.

personalfinance,ffey0ui,t3_esrm7u,1579869966.0,"So I moved 3 times this year and it’s making filing local taxes a pain. 

The first address I lived at from January-June and the local income tax rate was 3.5% or so. 

The second address was June-October and the local rate is 1.25%. 

Then the final and current address started November 1. 

I don’t have to file for the first address because residents aren’t required to file a return, there are no refunds or possibilities to owe taxes.

For the other two, if I folllow their formula to calculate the amount of income and amount withheld, I get crazy numbers. 

They say to do (state wages/12)*(number of months) for income and then (withheld/12)*(number of months) for amount withheld. The first address tax rate throws this off completely so what I tried to do is use the other portion of my W-2 which reports only the amount withheld to my employer location (which is what my withholding switched to when I moved from Address 1 to Address 2). Wage calculation was done the same using the total state wages divided by 12 multiplied by the months at each address. Then for withholding I did amount withheld to Jurisdiction 1 divided by 6 (bc June-Dec) multiplied by 4 for Address 2 and 2 for Address 3. 

Does this seem right? If I do it the other way, it basically comes down to both jurisdictions for A1 and A2 owing me like $500 each which is not right.
