single,ferzuiw,t1_ferxs24,1579360015.0,"You should probably know someone before you attempt to date them. Meeting someone and dating after knowing each other for months is nothing. It takes years and time to truly get to know someone. 
Why would you want to date someone you don’t know.

A lot of us pretend we know someone after a few months and years later find ourselves saying we didn’t truly know them and relationships end poorly because most of the time we’re dating each other while attempting to get to know one another. 

Just letting you know if you want a real relationship you need years to get to know someone well enough.

I’ve had multiple relationships, am much older than you and can say confidently you have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about and you’re in for a rude awakening if you settle for relationships out of loneliness. We’ve all done it, and we almost all regret it. You’ll see."
single,ferhcsa,t3_eq5r93,1579353867.0,"You’re 20 years old dude. You have to actually get to know people before you date them. Like know them for years. You don’t just get a significant other because you want one and feel lonely. You need to develop friendships and allow it to happen naturally. 

You sound too desperate."

Even though she obviously doesn’t want to date him, she still cares about him & arguably would have been married to him instead had he not continuously struggled with drug addiction. She traded a meth addict for an alcoholic."

I was also more astonished that people suffering from drug addiction are being put in jail instead of being given actual help. 

I get it- no one wants crack or meth to be legal. 

However- that doesn’t mean we have to throw these poor people in fucking jail for being humans. I’m just saying people with drug addiction usually are victims of abuse, assault, and significant trauma. Idk why we add to it by throwing them in prison.

It’s one thing to drive while intoxicated (chon) 

It’s another to simply be doing drugs, (Tracie) 

& also drugs is something every single one of us does whether it’s caffeine or crack. So I’m not sure why we treat people who use more intense “gross” substances so  poorly.
