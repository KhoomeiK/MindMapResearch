EntitledBitch,fcgj57r,t1_fcgh1jm,1577640659.0,I don't know else what to tell you. If you want your money you need to fight for that. Tipping is not mandatory. Wages are. Take a stand for yourself. If your boss can't afford to pay you then that's just an acknowledgement that he was being subsidized by the unfair tipping practice in the first place.
EntitledBitch,fcgixkb,t1_fcghka8,1577640577.0,Think of it this way: commission comes out of the boss' overhead sourced from money collected from a service already rendered to the customer. It is part of the cost already paid by the customer. The difference is that a customer agrees to pay cost and tip is an addition to the cost. Just add what would be a tip to the cost and you've solved all the problems.
EntitledBitch,fcghjh4,t1_fcfbf2d,1577640105.0,"Choosing beggars have personal reasons for choosing what they beg. That's not a contradiction, it's a reality.

The intent is not to ""stick it to the man"". It is to preserve my self-interest. And the tipping system is intentionally designed to catalyze that. Stop trying to appeal to a system of justice that doesn't exist. Your boss is taking home your money either way."
EntitledBitch,fcgh3go,t1_fcfbf4e,1577639942.0,"The source of the problem is the motivation to derive profit. As long as you accept profit motive as the basis for exchange someone is being hurt by the exchange ad infinitum. That's what profit means.

EntitledBitch,fcggsah,t1_fcfiv35,1577639795.0,"The exchange of money inherently implies a judgement of quality. That's the entire basis of the market.

The problem as it stands is exactly that people are seeking quality for a good deal and are not required to tip. Most people are not wholly rational consumers and thus tip. Some do not and that hurts the servers while benefiting all other involved parties."

EntitledBitch,fce1yhs,t1_fcatbwm,1577616084.0,The restaurant should be providing it. That's the entire point. Charge more for food. Oh you get less customers that way? Gee... imagine that. The restaruant is attracting customers with artificially lowered prices. And you are taking that side? Now that's what I call customer SERVICE.
EntitledBitch,fce1lhy,t1_fcc12u6,1577615968.0,Because the restaraunt owner knows people won't always pay the full tip but they still got their cost back for the food.

EntitledBitch,fcdyb22,t1_fcd8vxh,1577615075.0,I already don't go out to eat. You're not getting tips from me either way. The entire point of tipping is that it is technically not mandatory and so more people patronize the business because the service is artificially cheap. Bark UP the tree not down it.
EntitledBitch,fcdxxzq,t1_fccyuya,1577614946.0,All lower paying jobs are more stressful. That's the fucking point. If we went around paying people more because their work was essential to the system capitalism would fall apart. Custodians make tips too. Firefighters beg for money in their boots.

EntitledBitch,fcdwcnk,t1_fcbukep,1577614493.0,I have no problem with the level of service at fast food. In fact it's often better than the constant checking in and prodding me about my experience. The tipbaiting is actively annoying.
EntitledBitch,fcdv5oz,t1_fcc4skf,1577614153.0,So you're acknowledging that the ability to skimp on tips attracts people to eat at restaurants in the first place and that restaurants rely on the inconsistency of patrons' tips to remain profitable. The implication is that without tips and just adding it to the cost means people would not eat and the restaurant would go out of business. It's a race to the bottom same as any other industry.
EntitledBitch,fcduv4q,t1_fcd3avw,1577614034.0,Then the restaurant should go out of business. Not such a difficult equation.
EntitledBitch,fcdung7,t1_fcd001b,1577613950.0,Your incentive to work rush hour shifts is between you and your employer. Negotiate or unionize.
EntitledBitch,fcdud9d,t1_fcc9ucc,1577613915.0,Yes please just increase the cost of the food instead. Please. Please.
EntitledBitch,fcdu5gf,t1_fcahnyn,1577613874.0,15% you mean. I can't make ends meet between actual inflation and this tip inflation.
