The Chinese are smart and industrious, but what technology exists to get a thousand cubic miles of air moving, which is necessary to create weather. The rain comes from the oceans, mostly, and you have to evaporate it, transport the moisture laden air to where you want it, and cool it to release the rain, at a cost that is profitable for whatever your reason is. And you'd have to hide your machinery from spy satellites, which can read newspaper headlines. The energy required for a hurricane is immense, at one end of the scale. I just googled it, and a hurricane can release the equivalent of a ten megaton atom bomb every 20 minutes. That gives a sense of scale to how expensive, energy wise, it takes to create weather.

I'm sorry, we disagree.  I am capable of having a rational discussion about this.  I'm a firearms owner, have been for 50 years. I have two AR's, a number of pistols, and several other firearms. The vast majority of 2nd amendment cultists refuse to recognize that society has a right to be safe.

You refer to the founders.  You realize that it was common for post revolutionary towns to require that firearms be kept in a central armory, right?  You recognize that in those times, militias got together and drilled together.  The founders were not demonstrably interested in people shooting each other. 

You refer to the second amendment.  The constitution can be amended.  If gun owners refuse to come to the table and insist on working this language to the result of society feeling realistically safe,  you may be dismayed at the actions that society may take.  

I believe its better for responsible gun owners to use the social intelligence that you appear to lack to exhort our mouthbreathing friends to shut the fuck up. It does not advance the cause of responsible firearms ownership to parade around quipping about how the libtards better shut up and leave trump alone, lest there be a civil war.
