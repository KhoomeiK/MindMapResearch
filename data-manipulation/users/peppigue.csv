AskReddit,feosyzr,t1_feo9k23,1579304954.0,"I think we are better off not betting on one horse. Not saying bet on more horses within romance, but betting on more horses than just romance. I've come to the point where I don't trust people who don't have interests or hobbies that engage them. It can take some or even a lot of the load off of romance's, family's and friends's shoulders, and be meaningful independently of other goings on in one's life."

In Norway, I manage easily without one, but I'm frugal and only launder for one. My sister, laundering for a family of five, would insist she couldn't live without one. I say it's just a modern comfort/luxury that people get used to."

NoStupidQuestions,feikpqs,t1_feifx01,1579140789.0,"It's much joy for the money, better bang for the buck than ie going to the movies. Yes, that's the scale I usually gamble at. What I'm proposing here is betting an amount that hurts a little bit, but that I happily forget if an election goes my way politically. If the election goes the other way, it sweetens the loss.

Btw I had a friend who screwed himself over gambling, so know very well it's not for everyone. But I have a lot of experience with small time betting not getting out of hand."
NoStupidQuestions,feijxra,t1_feifumt,1579140262.0,"Definitely not in a bind. Not talking life-changing sums here, just something to sweeten the potential loss. Money I'd gladly wave goodbye to if the election goes my way."
NoStupidQuestions,feijods,t1_feifwt1,1579140086.0,"I would definitely not gamble such amounts. I gamble quite regularly, but small sums. What I was thinking was a bet putting in an amount that hurts just a little bit, but would soften the impact of an election loss. Sweeten the loss, so to speak. Think I'm gonna do it."

wholesomebpt,feidowi,t1_feglwr6,1579136093.0,"Here's my two cents on parenting:

The first 12-24 months they are babies. Babies are not like non-babies. Get advice from people with experience, and maybe read a book or ten. babysleep.com is good I understand.

The rest of your lives together: people of all ages are always attuned to what people around them are expressing, communicating. Not just in words, not just between the lines, but through demeanor and body language as well. This means people are always, 24/7, being role models for each other.

This means that any conscious action or talking you plan, maybe rehearse, research, to teach your kid anything, is dwarfed by the time you are being your real self with or around them. So show them how to be not only a good person, but a whole person, how to behave towards others and also towards yourself.

Don't hesitate to not be an angel, react honestly to things, make mistakes, just make sure to be clearly communicating with those around you about your whats and whys. Forget perfection, it's about doing imperfection well."

I think we all have innate but variable levels of opportunistic thinking, and variable levels of restraints against acting on amoral opportunities. It's our aptitude for constructive analysis and imagination instead applied towards scheming and fraud."

videos,fei5jit,t1_fehurc7,1579130754.0,"This somehow reminded me of how I think a common theme of many western culture issues is the shielding from consequences our societal wealth and structure provides.

There are still significant incentives to be law abiding and keep one's finances in order, timing and planning establishing a family vs focusing on education and career, and be nice to people so they are more likely to be nice in return.

But if one chooses to cut corners, abuse friendships, steal from work, or worse, it lessens the risks compared to those of the shunning and expulsion that might be imposed by an uncivilized community, where the consequence was in a very tangible way increased work and risk to one's own life.

It is never a sufficient explanation for the pathology of any individual, but on a population level I believe the indirectness of modern life carries plenty of blame for our epidemic levels of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, obesity, loneliness, stress, insomnia..."
