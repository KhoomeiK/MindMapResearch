This happened to me once before. Took an older dog in for a growth removal. Upon picking her up, was told the vet had ""forgotten"" the site of the growth and had found another one and removed it, then found the correct one and they removed that too. I had already discussed the other growth with the vet during the consultation and said not to remove it, it was very small and I had been keeping an eye on it, plus the location made for a more difficult recovery time. I had a long back and forth with the staff and ultimately they refunded me the surgery cost (minus meds) and I made them provide me with a list of steps they would take to prevent anything like this from happening in the future. Needless to say I never returned to that particular vet. 

I was livid. And you have every right to be too."
