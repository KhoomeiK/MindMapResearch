Embark doesn't even ask you what you think your dog is, or require you to upload a photo. By and large, the big names (Wisdom, Embark) are pretty good, and have also gotten much more accurate over time since these tests first started hitting the market. Embark is partnered with Cornell Veterinary, so I figure if anyone knows what they're doing, they probably do. If nothing else, the health results they return are cold, hard, data on whether your dog has certain gene variants or not."
dogs,ff6v059,t1_ff6jq68,1579635444.0,"My 75 lb, very obviously German shepherd mix, came back a quarter Chihuahua from Wisdom, lol. I contacted customer service, and they manually reviewed and modified his results and said the algorithm made a mistake... I went with Embark for my next dog."
dogs,ff6uvnz,t1_ff6l9dk,1579635372.0,"Human DNA testing is definitely more difficult than dog. While dog breeds have closed genetic pools thanks to relatively standard kennel club registrations (so it's easy to know what constitutes a poodle or a German shepherd), human DNA companies like Ancestry and 23andMe have to make an educated guess at what a representative Irish or German or African individual is, then average their unique DNA patterns with other assumed representatives. That's why the human DNA algorithms change periodically - the companies continue to refine what each representative DNA population ""looks"" like at the molecular level, and what ""signatures"" seem to indicate heritage from that country. And of course for both dogs and humans, very low readings below 1 or 2% are just as likely to be false positives!"
AskReddit,ff5c8v9,t3_ero8mj,1579586987.0,"She'd be stoked that I (we?) outgrew my awkward phase, thrilled with where I live and that I have dogs, and maybe baffled by my career. Probably would be disappointed I picked up more health problems over the years. Definitely would be disappointed at all the video games I never finished."

roughcollies,fdbsv56,t1_fdbc2zc,1578261519.0,"Mine is also a very picky eater and has a sensitive stomach to boot. Went through 6 dog foods before I settled on one that I felt was good quality and that she was at least mostly neutral about, and I just change out the toppers every few days (different flavors of bone broth, crumbled treats on top, etc). That keeps her eating pretty well, but even then she'll just decide maybe she doesn't feel like breakfast or dinner that day. She's the first dog I've had who is such a challenge to feed! Her previous owner free fed, so I think some of it is self-regulation of her weight."
confession,fcwi5ua,t1_fcwctr0,1578026261.0,"Also people who have a service dog (seeing eye, medical alert,  mobility assistance, psychiatric, etc). Very difficult for them to fit together in a normal stall."
pokemongo,fcu1n9n,t1_fctyeg7,1577969564.0,"You can definitely avoid buying in one, I just meant OP is unlikely to be able to disband an existing HOA, unfortunately. I'm not a fan of them either. Never had a good HOA experience. At least mine hasn't come after Pokemon Go yet."
pokemongo,fctetzm,t1_fcten0b,1577940996.0,"It very much depends on where you live. Many states have laws that require a neighborhood have an HOA if it meets certain criteria (built after a certain year, has a certain number of houses, etc)."
AskReddit,fcrsb7l,t3_eii9ke,1577905956.0,I'm sure I'm not the first (and won't be the last) to say a well-tailored suit does a guy a lot of favors.
dogs,fckawu6,t1_fcjlff8,1577721174.0," Whoops, sorry about that! My apologies for the mistake. Also, very  glad that your story had a happy ending, and best wishes to you, Rocky,  and Bella!"
dogs,fcg15l7,t1_fcfqwwx,1577635518.0,"That's what OP did at the end of the story - she said she ""paid the same as a cheap bottle of wine,"" which is the chip registration fee."
relationship_advice,fcah1nu,t1_fca6vee,1577569106.0,"Even can be normal in the US. I'm friends with a couple who are both divorcees, but are in a long-term relationship with each other and decided to have a child together. They have been engaged for a few years but have no particular plans for an actual wedding. They're very happy together, live together, etc. I think the engagement was just a little bit of formalization for them, but they're both gun-shy over an actual second marriage. I think it all depends on the couple and their situation.  
OP's situation seems like a whole different ball game, though."
dogs,fc5yle7,t1_fc5n72t,1577468548.0,"Very true! I'm not disagreeing with you at all. I was more saying that for some people, the likelihood of a multi-thousand dollar vet bill is higher (in a high cost of living area, there are more conditions/treatments that could hit that threshold), and insurance might be a better deal for them. For people with lower local vet costs, maybe saving and/or investing the money makes more sense, since the chance of a catastrophic bill is lower. Also, knowing how much treatments range in your area can inform your choices on coverage and deductibles, if you do get insurance. The important thing is having a feasible plan in place in case something happens! One thing that I did when I adopted my dog was shop around for a low-interest line of credit, which I opened in case of emergencies. I never have used it, but it's there if I ever need it, ready to go, and it wouldn't be something I would have to stress over in a potentially time-sensitive situation."
dogs,fc5m5vi,t1_fc5jo8f,1577461252.0,"Depends on where you live. My elderly dog had major abdominal surgery and a week's stay at the emergency vet for about $2,200. It's important to know what the average veterinary costs are for your area, how much insurance would cost, and if you choose to save the premiums and deductibles yourself, commit to actually putting that money away."
offmychest,fc409op,t3_efxe7a,1577403234.0,"Started to write a whole long reply about how true this is, but ended up with so many examples that I deleted it. You're spot on. I think we've all had these cringey moments before, whether it's over career, interests, house and car maintenance, or basically anything else that requires moderate competence but is more often taken care of by men. I've even had someone stop and ask me why my husband (a non-existent person) wasn't ""taking care of all that"" when I was moving shrubs and putting in a new flower bed out front, and when I said that I was plenty capable of doing it myself, they complimented me like it was some huge feat. Come on, now. I'm digging big holes in the ground and dropping plants in."
roughcollies,fc0rvzu,t1_fc0qdpy,1577298167.0,"The Old Time Scotch Collie Association would disagree with you about the BYB pitch part, and they do [acknowledge that it is largely a land race breed](https://www.scotchcollie.org/breed/breed-standard/). They also have at least a rough sketch of breed standards. I fully acknowledge that I'm positive there are disreputable people who just use the name to sell their unpapered, unhealthy, or far off standard dogs, though... but then, there's also people making $$$ selling doodles, so... But back to the point, it would seem that Scotch collies are more organized and at least a bit more standardized than just ""my unspayed collie had an accidental litter and I want to sell these puppies somehow.""

Yes, I did mention that it ""creates a little bit more of a land race (a la Alaskan husky vs Siberian husky)"", because the Alaskan husky is a land race, and the Siberian is a breed. Like old time Scotch collies are a land race vs AKC collies are a breed."
