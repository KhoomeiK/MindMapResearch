sexlessmarriage,fdqpclx,t3_emnx5a,1578671984.0,"If you find that solution that does not involve cheating, I'd love to hear it. I'm in same situation . My husband is a narcissist and has withheld sex for almost 4 years now. Been married 30 years and after year 3 he's had ED. He won't entertain the idea of seeing a doctor at all. I'm (f) 47 and hes (m) 58. I want that sex life that I've openly expressed to him and all I get is ok! I give up.  I won't cheat , I just simply go on without. Thanks for sharing.  I truly hope your situation turns around for u"

AskReddit,fdndk4k,t3_elssvy,1578583510.0,"My mother had the radio on all the time. In the car, in the house ,room to room intercom system allowed her to listen every where she went. I used to believe that each song played was live in studio . Each band played live music 24/7 on the radio. I'd wonder how they'd get set up so quickly for next song to play? And that radio station must have been huge! I was shocked when found out about records and cassette tapes!"

bipolar,fdkiy6n,t3_elslwt,1578504725.0,"Your fiance' is a definite keeper. Hard to find someone who understands you , who truly supports you, and is willing to stick this out with you. Bipolar makes me mean at times , makes me resent those  who cant see my depression and want to help instead of walking around me. I'd give up many things to have a supporter. Take care of yourself always and thank you for sharing."
