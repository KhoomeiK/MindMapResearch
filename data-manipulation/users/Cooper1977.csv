The only thing I'll warn other people about is don't teach your dog 2 handed signs. You're always going to be carrying something or holding something and then struggle to do a 2 handed sign at the same time."

shadowsofbrimstone,fcut6rk,t3_ej1ayz,1577988012.0,"Depending on the expansions and extras you have access to, I suppose it could be done. There's no reason you could't tailor a threat deck to not contain monsters, and only contain bandits and Scafford gang guys, or the Blackfang tribe. You'd need to create your own scenarios probably. Also exploration tokens would be weird since you'd want to remove the ones with gates.  
   
Honestly the more I think about this, the more difficult it would be to do, since you'd need to tailor encounter cards as well.  So I think my short answer would be ""yes you could do it, but Cowboys vs Cthulhu is pretty much on the box and it would be more effort to do what you're asking than \*I\* think it's worth.""

Good luck though."
