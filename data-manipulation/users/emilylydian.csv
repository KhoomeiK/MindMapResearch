fosterdogs,ff1w8gl,t3_er3cji,1579487590.0,I’ve had two fosters that were returned from other foster homes because they weren’t good fits and too much work. The first one I was told wasn’t potty trained and was a nipper. He was fine with me (including the potty training).. sometimes they just need the right environment to feel safe. The second one was a foster fail and she’s sprawled on my couch next to me as we speak. :)

Real_Estate,fditszv,t3_elfkx9,1578450881.0,"Honestly, most of these fixes may make it a little more saleable but doesn’t really improve value. Is there a way you can keep it and rent it out maybe?"

RealEstate,fda51wz,t3_ekesba,1578241782.0,"A lot of the time emailing and texts get lost in translation. You have to realize how many inquiries agents get… A lot. Some are ready to go and some are not… Some want to use the listing agent to open doors but have a realtor… Some say they have cash but do not. There are a lot of reasons why we may want to protect our time a little. I’m not saying she shouldn’t have shown the place, that’s a huge disservice to her client. But sometimes picking up the phone and having a conversation goes a long way... Could you not have just called her and explained your situation a little more? Also.. she should have called you.. Either way, there should have been a conversation in my opinion.."

homeowners,fd6lclb,t3_ek5jj9,1578192702.0,This seems legit to me. They mentioned they have family in the business… Sometimes we (Realtors) will do something like this for our clients when we can’t find a home on the market for them and they want to live in a specific neighborhood. They probably gave them advice on how to do it…
dogs,fd6jngf,t3_ek4rw0,1578192056.0,Yaaa! Congrats!! I rescued my first dog about 2 years ago. First thing we did was enroll in obedience school.. i learned more than he did I think. It was good.. it taught me how to dog. He’s been amazing. Now just foster failed my first puppy so now I have too!
