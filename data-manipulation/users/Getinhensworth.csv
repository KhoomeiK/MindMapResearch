In an abusive relationship, the person will try to isolate. They will likely talk ish about a lot of people in their life, but then put you down and compare you to these people. They might blame you and get angry over things that are insignificant. For example, you did not put away laundry, you are not outgoing enough, you were flirting with them. They blow up and might give you a totally different attitude when you get home and both of you are alone. Do they tell you how to dress, who to see, who you can talk to? Yes you are more likely in an abusive relationship.

My aunt was a bitch to her ex-husband. Would blow up at him in front of company. I always thought he was the sweetest uncle ever. He was really cool too and did competitions for martial arts. They are now divorced. But she would be disrespectful and argue with him in front of others. 

It is not your responsibility for someone else’s harm or attempt. But what makes you believe she would attempt? Has she given you reason to believe she would?"
depression,fd3mcb3,t3_ejw74l,1578159736.0,"When you are 19 the future seems unknown. You only have the past to reflect on. And that was even not as enjoyable. It seems like your youth is gone. Your barely a man and not even 20. What a time to be young again. Life is just beginning. When I was 19, I was severely depression and suicidal. What I needed was a therapist and a healthy support system. You know what was scary? Not knowing how to become an adult. Also, scary to choose and become someone. On top of that, was in a relationship still from high school that was toxic. I ended up leaving one of my college classes to go puke because I was so disgusted and hurt. Life was shitty. 10 years later, I wished someone told me, you are young and to know you have unless possibles. Enjoy your youth, because you are still in your teens. Even at 29, I know my youth is still hanging around. But if I could go back to the 19 year old me. I would say you are beautiful, you are worthy, and you can put anything you put your mind to. This time is difficult because it’s a space of pressure. People start asking questions like...what are you doing after school, what do you want to become, peers start to go to college, maybe they are off traveling or possibly other things like business, working, families, or getting into trouble. You young man, are in fact young. So young that you can’t even enjoy a drink in the US. That you can’t rent a car. Even these arbitrary milestones, you have yet to experience. 
You would benefit from being able to talk to about these things. Are you at college?"
Needafriend,fd3jksl,t3_ejyfsk,1578158959.0,"Yes when guys know they have amenity, they get really creepy at times. I’ve had people try to mess around and like get on a videocam or send me dick pictures. People are gross. I think people try to manipulate and say you’re not a girl because they are egging on to see if you’ll cave and show who you are. There are some losers out there."
depression,fd3iis1,t1_fd1sg2m,1578158640.0,Yes. The zoning out is a common thing with acute depression/anxiety. It often happens with me when I’m overwhelmed or thinking. I’ve been in therapy and on medication for about 2.5 months. Are you getting any help at all?
depression,fd1rfh8,t3_eju46v,1578135630.0,"It is tiring to feel and experience all these things and yet want peace, friendship, and acceptance. It’s so tiresome to worry, compare, interact, loath, and doom. But it’s the reality of experience.  I know I have social anxiety but also some form of depression. I’ve been told I have “high functioning depression” or dysthymia. But I have episodes of major depression too. It sucks balls because I constantly worry and feel similar things. 
It’s lonely to be friendless and going to bed alone. It’s hard to get through the day because you seem distanced and preoccupied. I usually don’t like holding gaze with people when I feel anxious. I get lost within my worries. Sometimes they are right and mostly they are wrong. But it really impacts my motivation, moods, and overall affect. I sleep a ton too. I sometimes just want someone who cares about me. But at the same time in guarded and don’t trust, but I also felt like I’m piecing together my ego. I feel mad about things too. It’s hard dealing with everything in your head because it makes you feel ever more alone...I don’t want to be known as that friend or like a hot mess. I’m tired of being sad."
