My gf (28F) and I started dating a couple years back, and she has a very attractive friend (24F). A bottle service instagram influencer type of girl. Actually most of my girlfriends friends are quite good looking. The first time I met them was a bit overwhelming. In the beginning, that thought of having a chance with another was always there. That annoying little voice. While they may be attractive, so Is my gf, and there are deeper layers to a relationship than just physical attraction. I find my gf’s soul beautiful, as I hope she finds the same beauty in mine. Physical attraction does play a role in the beginning of the relationship, and helps initiate the physical contact, but beyond that it should deepen to the intangibles. Having trust in each other and being there for each other is more attractive than any physical draw to another person. 
Hope this helps shed clarity from the other side 

TL:DR. It fades. Relationships grow past the physical and infatuation with others."

depression,fdixdkp,t3_elhhgz,1578453200.0,"The ole catch 22. I find self acceptance is helpful in these situations. Accept the current situation for what it is. Finding a close friend or girlfriend can help depending on how you are at opening up and communicating. All relationships require communication and openness, but none as much as an intimate one. I constantly apply this girlfriend bandaid to myself, and the only thing I want then is not having a girlfriend. The fix is from within not from with out."
