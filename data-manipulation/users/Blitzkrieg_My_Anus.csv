I mean, if they were to just tackle him to the ground (without the cone) he could hit his head on the concrete and die. Could have a heart attack from a taser.

Other than the guy giving up and being handcuffed almost all options I'm seeing have a \*potential\* for the guy to die.

The tiger one is shot from much closer to the ground. 


While the tiger is still huge - it's giving the tiger a slight boost to size due to angle."

AskVet,ff880dk,t3_es5ae2,1579668645.0,"First figure out how the mice are getting into your house and seal that hole or holes off. They can get through something as small as a quarter inch! (The distance between their eyes basically)


As messy as it is, flour around the perimeter of your walls will show you a trail.... perhaps keep the cat elsewhere for a day or two while you try to see where the tracks start.


Set up a baited live trap. ""Tin Cats"" they're called here. Some even have a plastic view window on the top so you can see if a mouse is in it.  They work awesome, and I've caught a dozen at a time in one. Like most traps, set it up against a wall (as mice run around the edge of things, instead of running across the center of a room).


They seem to like peanut butter or pet food as bait the most.

Which brings to the next point... keep your pet's food out of reach of the mice. It will lure them to the area, and then the baited trap won't work as well.


Also: ultrasonic mouse repellents do NOT work. Don't waste your money."
AskVet,ff7r818,t3_es3ubs,1579656399.0,"Personally mine will get a little bit of [almost] anything I eat. She likes broccoli, grapefruit, strawberries, carrot, banana, banana pepper, apples, pomegranate, pomelo, etc.


I just give her a small amount, a piece, and make sure it's not toxic to her before I give anything.

Don't give canned - it usually has a ton of salt in it.

I'd say fresh is preferred, but I'm not sure if anything is technically added to frozen veggies.


As for healthiest, I'm not too sure. I know my breeder recommends a little bit of spinach with her dog's food (like a very small amount) - but for actual nutrition I really can't say what is best for a dog."
