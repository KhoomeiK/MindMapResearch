HomeImprovement,fdjshd0,t1_fdjfivl,1578485878.0,"Hey thank you.  A lot of what I am reading seems anecdotal and I’m taking it with a grain of salt.  I appreciate the few posts from people who actually work for Lowe’s like you.  I’m sure any contractor will have a bad install at some point, and Lowe’s being such a big chain will likely have a lot of bad examples.  People don’t usually review the good work as quickly as the bad."
HomeImprovement,fdik75t,t1_fdihw5b,1578444743.0,"So can you explain the completion certificate?  It’s what I would sign at the end to say the project was finished?

HomeImprovement,fdi3j2m,t1_fdi03wo,1578435092.0,I’ve had the problem of not being able to find a decent independent contractor.  They are all booked up and don’t call back.  Do you know if these subs do their own freelance as well or just work strictly through Lowe’s?
HomeImprovement,fdhypni,t1_fdhxz61,1578432583.0,That’s great info.  I was worried about the door because I have an older 1950 southwest style cinderblock house with plaster inside and stucco outside.  And a friend told me they would have to cut into the plaster and stucco and all this stuff to change out a door and made it sound like a huge project.  Then i cruised this sub too much and worried about a botched job.  It’s already twice the price I was expecting but I wanted it done right.

nursing,fcybofd,t1_fcy0kul,1578077750.0,"Five figure raises between levels?  That’s basically a $5 raise.  That’s a pretty impressive bump.  In private I’m usually happy to get $1.50-$1.75 at most.  Maybe $2 on a good year, and that’s always subject to the benevolence of the hospital.  No Xmas bonuses this year but they have money for multi million dollar towers they are building.  Above all I appreciate stability and consistency and the Va seems like the will offer that."
nursing,fcuasta,t1_fcth10z,1577976642.0,"Wow thank you, that’s great info.  I’ve seen the pay scale pdf before but it’s super confusing to figure out where I would fall into it at.  HR hasn’t made an offer yet so I have no idea what the hourly/yearly rate will come in at.  Hopefully not significantly lowe than my current job."
Albuquerque,fcqxm24,t1_fco72ww,1577893750.0,"A 1950s house isn’t in itself a bad thing.  Some of these old houses have great character like original hardwood floors, better locations, functional floor plans.  I kind of figure that by saving money on an older house you expect to be needing to invest some money into upgrades, like redoing windows, some light remodeling, etc."
Albuquerque,fcqwedr,t1_fco5lcg,1577893231.0,I’m curious what size of house and property you get for under $200k in a decent neighborhood.  They are around but most seem either Ill kept or small.
Albuquerque,fcqvbkj,t3_eifgvy,1577892756.0,It sounded like D Day last night.  My dog was not appreciating it.  I stayed up until midnight and then wouldn’t let the dogs out to pee until after 12:30 so I could hope as many stray bullets as possible wouldn’t land on my pups.
