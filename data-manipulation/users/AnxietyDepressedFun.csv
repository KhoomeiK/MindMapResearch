For months he sent me messages, I'd block him & he'd write notes & leave them on my porch. I went to the police & they just took my complaint & then scheduled an officer drive by every few hours. The police actually caught him driving up & down my street at like 4 in the morning & arrested him for driving under the influence.

I rarely if ever had anything with artificial sweeteners, I grew up in one of those full fat, only white bread, enjoy food kind of homes so it wasn't until I was an adult that I ever had any interaction with them. So Coke is literally one of the only things that I can keep down during a migraine, and my dear sweet husband thought I should switch to Coke Zero (our dietary hangups are pretty much exact opposite) so I tried but my Migraines got so much worse. Then a doctor tried to give me that Cambia medicine which is like an NSAID powder with Aspartame & that's when I knew...

mildlyinteresting,ffbv2k7,t1_ffbokrq,1579783744.0,"I worked for an apartment owner/reno company for years that specialized in 60's - 70's development & saw a ton of these in some of the high-rises, trash chutes as well. For the most part they are removed because they create inefficiencies in terms of insulation, air quality issues & in some cases fire hazards. Not only do they create a back-draft situation, many of the walls surrounding them were left without proper insulation, which means the walls aren't properly reenforced and because they were usually wood or plaster material, they just didn't age well inside of walls. 

Trash chutes are still common in large scale mid/high rises because in general they have a return slot door, were made of metal & often were placed along side cinderblock/brick firewalls. I've never seen one that wasn't backed by one of these walls which just don't exist in homes."

migraine,ffb5p6x,t1_ffaq9h4,1579752482.0,"So my first experience with weed, I was like 30, had never tried it & my husband had a volcano vaporizer but the smoke burnt so bad it basically never entered my system. We tried edibles next & if it wasn't for the years & years of experience with panic attacks I would have sworn I was dying. I tried it, home alone, during a migraine & my heart started racing so badly I felt like it was going to just fucking quit. I texted my husband told him I was dying, he called & I couldn't even speak, he just heard me reciting my panic attack phrases. I basically chant ""you're okay, it's okay, everything is okay"" over and over again. I was stuck in full panic, in a cold dark room for 2 hours. Worst panic of my life.

Xanax is like a very, very unique feeling. I always call it general okayishness, I am still not fully feeling okay but I'm less concerned about the feeling. It just numbs the anxiety for a bit - sometimes it works way better than others, but not in any predictable pattern. Personally I liked Valium more, but because my attacks are acute, Xanax has been a part of my life for going on 10 years now. I still take regular breaks from it just to ensure I'm not addicted to the feeling but honestly it's never given me the euphoria and the only withdraw I get is increased anxiety. I've also never needed to change my dose, but I understand why someone might need to.

On & on these ""mystical"" prophecies that people have been convinced we're about their specific time in history. Seriously, humans have a propensity to see patterns and interpret things to match, hence why every ""global"" change can be seen as an end of day prophecy.

news,feg8urh,t1_feg4dbz,1579082609.0,"No one but a developer can ""own"" an HOA & by law they are required to turn over said HOA by a certain time after the last home is built. HOA's are independent, 99% of the time non-profit organizations whose board members are volunteers elected by community votes. While the board money is not taxed it has to be spent on things like ""common area maintenance"" and it is illegal to not allocate it properly. The cost of HOA dues are NOT tax deductible, there is no tax incentive to live in an HOA.

What I think you are talking about is ""property managers"" for things like rental homes, condos, etc. Those can be owned by a for profit business and are often owned by non-local entities. Scott-Brown properties comes to mind, but that is an entirely different thing than an HOA."
news,feg8e7g,t1_fefzqsa,1579081944.0,"No the HOA can be sued by owners for not enforcing their own laws. HOA covenants are like laws that everyone who lives there agreed too, you can't enforce one law on one person but not another. The attorneys for the HOA are legally obligated to send the letter, if they don't the HOA itself is ""selectively enforcing"" & can get into big trouble. 

I realize HOA hate runs deep (I don't disagree, I choose not to live in one) but imagine if a city only ever wrote speeding tickets to black people. Speeding is illegal but they selectively enforce the law & allow every other race to speed, which means they aren't enforcing it properly. Now say a person dies in a car accident because a white guy was speeding, the police basically condoned it so are they not also at fault? I realize this is an extreme comparison but it's the reason laws (and CC&R's) are not selectively enforceable.

The attorneys likely sent out this letter hoping the owners would petition the HOA board for an exemption, or for a bylaw addendum so they can continue enforcing the rules without violating anyone's rights.

news,feg7ri2,t1_feg07wj,1579081048.0,"55+ communities still pay the same taxes for schools & everything else. The main difference is most of these communities offer things like ""senior's water aerobics classes"" and organize ""bingo nights"" or offer other age appropriate group activities for their residents. Their only other benefit over a basic HOA community is that essentially they provide housing to a ""protected class"", often senior's struggled to find homes & loans in traditional mortgage communities (the idea that they won't be around for the entirety of the mortgage was sometimes a deterrent) & while it wasn't the biggest social injustice by a long shot, it was solved in most cases by ""active-adult"" communities."
news,feg7aac,t1_fefx7p1,1579080365.0,"An HOA management company is not an HOA board. Most people find this part really difficult to understand but let's say you live in an HOA community with 500 homes & you have a pool, gates, dog park, and some community green space right? The board is 5 volunteers, who all have jobs (because board members don't get paid) & families, not to mention their own homes to take care of. Well they need help filing their taxes, meeting the non-profit laws, budgeting, collections, reserve studies, processing online payments, Sending out violation letters handling architecture requests, finding pool maintenance, finding a gate company when something breaks, doing monthly inspections, answering emails from 500+ residents ... This list goes on but basically we are a company who gets paid to help the board do all of those things. 

HOA's are the exact same as they've always been. Living in one is restrictive and it cost money, in return you get better returns on your home & the assurances that your entire neighborhood will be held to a certain standard (No one is going to paint their house bright pink or spell fuck on the yard in plastic flamingos). You give up something, you get something, whether those trade-offs are worth it to you is at your discretion."

If that cap has been met or the HOA CC&R's don't have that stipulation and they don't enforce a covenant, they can be found in breach of contract and be forced to dissolve or be sued by the other owners. 

More than likely the letter from the HOA attorney is a ""first step"" as it were, to get the owners to file a petition to the HOA board, either for an ""exemption"" or for an updated bylaw to be proposed. The attorney sends a letter, the owners attend a board meeting & make their request, the entire community votes on the exemption or addendum to bylaws & then no one has to move or be sued or anything.

Chili as we know it comes from the Spanish chili con carne, literally chilis with meat. During the Caballero cattle drive era, they needed easily transportable food that could be made on a camp fire. Chili would be cooked in massive batches, then dried out & packed like bricks (sans water). Then all you had to do was throw it in the pot, add a bit of water & it rehydrated to a hearty meal. The salt kept the meat edible for a fairly long time. Adding beans which are full of moisture just didn't make sense.

The chili Terlingua cook-off is a major player in the world chili cook-off (yes it's a thing) and their number one rule is No additions of beans or spaghetti (because I guess some people do that?) 

Anyway that's a bunch of info I learned, but I will say if you want to add beans, go for it, just at that point you made a stew.

Xanax is like a very, very unique feeling. I always call it general okayishness, I am still not fully feeling okay but I'm less concerned about the feeling.

What I think you are talking about is ""property managers"" for things like rental homes, condos, etc. Those can be owned by a for profit business and are often owned by non-local entities. Scott-Brown properties comes to mind, but that is an entirely different thing than an HOA."
news,feg8e7g,t1_fefzqsa,1579081944.0,"No the HOA can be sued by owners for not enforcing their own laws. HOA covenants are like laws that everyone who lives there agreed too, you can't enforce one law on one person but not another. The attorneys for the HOA are legally obligated to send the letter, if they don't the HOA itself is ""selectively enforcing"" & can get into big trouble. 

I realize HOA hate runs deep (I don't disagree, I choose not to live in one) but imagine if a city only ever wrote speeding tickets to black people. Speeding is illegal but they selectively enforce the law & allow every other race to speed, which means they aren't enforcing it properly. Now say a person dies in a car accident because a white guy was speeding, the police basically condoned it so are they not also at fault? I realize this is an extreme comparison but it's the reason laws (and CC&R's) are not selectively enforceable.

The attorneys likely sent out this letter hoping the owners would petition the HOA board for an exemption, or for a bylaw addendum so they can continue enforcing the rules without violating anyone's rights.

The main difference is most of these communities offer things like ""senior's water aerobics classes"" and organize ""bingo nights"" or offer other age appropriate group activities for their residents. Their only other benefit over a basic HOA community is that essentially they provide housing to a ""protected class"", often senior's struggled to find homes & loans in traditional mortgage communities (the idea that they won't be around for the entirety of the mortgage was sometimes a deterrent) & while it wasn't the biggest social injustice by a long shot, it was solved in most cases by ""active-adult"" communities."
news,feg7aac,t1_fefx7p1,1579080365.0,"An HOA management company is not an HOA board. Most people find this part really difficult to understand but let's say you live in an HOA community with 500 homes & you have a pool, gates, dog park, and some community green space right? The board is 5 volunteers, who all have jobs (because board members don't get paid) & families, not to mention their own homes to take care of. Well they need help filing their taxes, meeting the non-profit laws, budgeting, collections, reserve studies, processing online payments, Sending out violation letters handling architecture requests, finding pool maintenance, finding a gate company when something breaks, doing monthly inspections, answering emails from 500+ residents ... This list goes on but basically we are a company who gets paid to help the board do all of those things. 

HOA's are the exact same as they've always been. Living in one is restrictive and it cost money, in return you get better returns on your home & the assurances that your entire neighborhood will be held to a certain standard (No one is going to paint their house bright pink or spell fuck on the yard in plastic flamingos). You give up something, you get something, whether those trade-offs are worth it to you is at your discretion."
news,fefvltt,t1_fefiimr,1579066634.0,"I work for an HOA management company (in marketing) but have a ton of experience with Real Estate law.

If that cap has been met or the HOA CC&R's don't have that stipulation and they don't enforce a covenant, they can be found in breach of contract and be forced to dissolve or be sued by the other owners. 

More than likely the letter from the HOA attorney is a ""first step"" as it were, to get the owners to file a petition to the HOA board, either for an ""exemption"" or for an updated bylaw to be proposed. The attorney sends a letter, the owners attend a board meeting & make their request, the entire community votes on the exemption or addendum to bylaws & then no one has to move or be sued or anything.

Chili as we know it comes from the Spanish chili con carne, literally chilis with meat. During the Caballero cattle drive era, they needed easily transportable food that could be made on a camp fire. Chili would be cooked in massive batches, then dried out & packed like bricks (sans water). Then all you had to do was throw it in the pot, add a bit of water & it rehydrated to a hearty meal. The salt kept the meat edible for a fairly long time. Adding beans which are full of moisture just didn't make sense.

The chili Terlingua cook-off is a major player in the world chili cook-off (yes it's a thing) and their number one rule is No additions of beans or spaghetti (because I guess some people do that?) 

Anyway that's a bunch of info I learned, but I will say if you want to add beans, go for it, just at that point you made a stew.
