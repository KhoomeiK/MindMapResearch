Just monitor any side effects and tell your doctor right away, there are a lot of types of antidepressants and when you start with it, there is usually some time (months really) where your doctor might change the dose or switch the antidepressant trying to figure which is best for you.

Worst case scenario: they won't work. But you shouldn't fear them, they are safe. Even if they seem not to work (which, btw, is my case), keep taking them, you never know if they **are** working a little and without them it would be worst. Every time I tried to stop, I felt slightly worse.

Single huge dose of paracetamol is ""safe"" enough that Paracetamol is the drug of choice to mix on Codeine packets. Ever wondered why put such small painkiller in a pill with such a strong painkiller? its not there to help the Codeine, its there to cause paracetamol overdose BEFORE Codeine overdose. The Paracetamol overdose will cause vomiting and diarrhea, which will prevent the remainder of Codeine from being absorbed.

Most people who get serious liver damage due to paracetamol have been taking big (non overdose) doses of it for long periods of time. But a single overdose will cause you to be so ill that you end up getting treatment and Paracetamol HAVE an antidote that can be administered in the ER (or you can take it yourself even).

My advice to put this behind you is: it happens, people are depressed, and sometimes they will try self-harm. In my experience, you cannot kill yourself with OTC drugs (yes, most ER visits are due to paracetamol overdose, but they do not always lead to death, often a quick treatment to clean the system off of it and then liver monitoring). Almost all drugs that can be lethal in overdose are controlled.

Here stays my warning: thinking of self-harm, don't use Paracetamol, it will just grant you a visit and bad day at the ER. Worst thing you can do when you are depressed and down is to make it worse."

Music isn't groundbreaking anymore because there is nothing else to be invented, any 8 notes you play will be in a hundred songs around the world, any melody or rhythm have been used for a hundred years. 

I remember being that naive on my 20's, that Anime were the new thing, that J-Pop (Kpop was still copying J-pop) was the new thing. It isn't, when we are young everything is new and exciting. I grew tired of Anime, then of Korean Dramas, there is nothing new after you get used to it. When I was young, the older said Anime was already repeating itself, that the west was repeating itself, that Korea was copying Japan. I thought they were all just old stupid sad people, now I Agree with them.

Eastern culture is NEW to ignorant western people, so it seems so groundbreaking. But after you watch the same Kdrama trope 10 times, the same derivative Kpop 100 times, and learn their culture and clichés enough to identify them on everything new, you will get it. Oh, I was just not used to their culture, now I am, now its not new.

No, there was no innovation on East Asia, only more Westerns trying to get something new out of it. But just like in the 90's, and 2000's, and 2010's, and 2019 they said East Asia culture would overtake Western culture ""in a few years"" and it never happened, we will still have Western culture mainstream in the west, with 5%~10% influence of Asian culture, in the 2030, in the 2040, and so on. And the young will still say the same thing: Asian culture will overtake Western culture ""soon"". Only to get used to it in their 30's and ""get it""

Cultures won't overtake others, even in this globalized world. You are just too young and new to it, so it seems different and exciting (it is at first, enjoy). As soon as you learn about it, you will actually miss the old US mainstream crap that you don't see for years. Seriously, after years watching Kdrama and Anime, I enjoy a lot the retarded reboots and more reboots in the west, they remind me of my youth and when I thought **that** was cool.

Learn to like what you like, but no, foreign culture will never be mainstream. Korean music is *still* listened more in Korea than US music, Korean dramas *still* air in prime time Korean TV. Anime is *still* the best in Japan, and all the crap that people say about US culture being mainstream in East Asia is bull, it isn't, it doesn't overtake their local culture, not by a far margin.

depression,fcnb9b5,t3_ei4frf,1577807911.0,"That is the start of a serious depression. It is hard, so build up some strength. 

I live in Brazil and I know pretty well the situation in Venezuela, it must be terrible, I can't even fathom how would I deal with it. I am unemployed in Brazil and I guess its still way better than being in an unstable country. Life sometimes hit you hard doesn't it?

I think the first thing you should put in your mind is that it is ABSOLUTELY NOT your fault. Bad things happen even in good countries, and life is always surprising us with bad (and good, sure) stuff. Don't let those get you down, just think ""ok, that was bad, but happens to everyone, lets move on"". You are great and you are trying, that is great.

Feeling tired is ""fatigue"", it is a major symptom of Depression, your body wants to protect yourself from all the bad things around by urging you to just hug a pillow and sleep all day, happens to every one of us (depressed people). Its normal, don't worry. Do indulge in it without shame or guilt, accept to relax sometimes.

I can't really tell you how to deal with the situation there, but I believe that we can be happy even in adversity. You have a good mother, a girlfriend, health. Focus on them. Be nice to them and the people around you, and they will often be nice to you, which makes you feel better. 

As for the suicidal ideation, that is bad, I have a lot too, the thing about suicidal thoughts is that if you let it, they will OVERWHELM you to the point that you will loose reason and might end up doing something out of spite or without thinking, so AVOID letting it get to that point. If you find yourself thinking those things, try to immediately do something else, focus on something, talk to people, distract from it, just don't let that thought grow. If it does, it CAN take over you.

Venezuela is in bad shape, but I think it has been going for too long, I have a hunch that it will start improving, not tomorrow or this month, but slowly. Hang on thigh, value the people around you, try to find things to do (even useless ones) to pass your time and take your mind out of the bad situations and you can get through this bad phase.

IF you can have access to a doctor, try a benzodiazepine. Not for daily use (thats kind of bad), but for when you feel you are loosing control and thinking the bad things again."

A week is kind of normal for something like that, just don't keep thinking about it and get into your mind that you will recover (you WILL). Don't let the depression control you. I am not talking to forgive yourself immediately, but slowly do calming thing, recover, LEARN with the mistake and move on, you will get out stronger from this experience.

Good news is you can break them. Start breaking them and take like 75%, then 50%, then 25%. When you cut them 50%/25% try to save the rest in a tight container, they won't spoil for one day so you can take that part too.


But under no circunstance stop cold turkey with Pristiq, the withdrawl starts less than 36h after the last dose and is bad. (i had to stop twice this thing, never more), so every other day won't help much, you will feel bad even then because Pristiq half-life is so small. Just try to break the pills and slowly take less and less. 15 days SHOULD go smooth.

I used to hate this effect too, but when my depression started getting worst, I welcomed it because if it was that bad with all this attenuation on emotions, I don't want to even imagine what would be without it.

Focus on the fact that often this is temporary, your doctor should eventually adjust the medication when you get better and you should start having your emotions back. Meanwhile, think like this: maybe, when I am really bad, its better not to have those emotions.

She did care, she just didn't want to scare me).

Changing meds at times like this is dangerous too, a new med might make it WORSE because they work in mysterious way (seriously, mental health drugs are poorly understood and on their infancy) so, again, some doctors will try to keep things stable with the known drug and then slowly change to prevent it. My last crisis we changed my meds and it made me INSANE, had to do an emergency stop and return to fluoxetine (safe, but weak).

Bottomline, antidepressants often work (last I read, about 50% of time), but they CAN make it worse too. Also, once you start with one, you have to keep going often for years, so doctor must ponder if its worth it or they can help you improve without it. 

Ask your doctor for ""emergency procedures"" when you are really bad, like get out of the house and walk around, don't let your mind go blank, think about good memories, and as much benzos are bad for long periods, they can save your life during one such attack.

My pro tip is: if you feel the suicidal thoughts coming, stop everything you are doing and try to avoid them surfacing at ALL COSTS. They WILL overwhelm you if you let it, and then it will be dangerous. DO NOT LET THEM OVERWHELM YOU, do whatever to get it out of your head."
