dvdcollection,ffitr6j,t1_ffibawz,1579982507.0,"He is probably the most acclaimed/successful director of all time, so... Yes."
dvdcollection,ffitndz,t1_ffh21ow,1579982430.0,"I would argue that Marriage Story, at the very least, is deserving of the Criterion treatment. However, look at it this way: If Criterion only ever released obscure and forgotten films, they would definitely have a niche audience, but they wouldn't bring in  enough money to be sustainable. By releasing more popular films once in a while (eg, Silence of the Lambs, Grand Budapest Hotel, and now Irishman/Marriage Story), this allows them the freedom to release more obscure films as well."

dvdcollection,ffech0h,t3_et3znd,1579843053.0,Brooklyn is underrated in my opinion. Such an excellent movie.
criterion,ffecc1d,t1_ff2e8bh,1579842926.0,Jon Brion is awesome. Just rewatched Punch Drunk Love and the soundtrack really makes that movie.
criterion,ffebwj0,t3_et4xln,1579842529.0,"Not necessarily my all time favorite, but I just watched Ikiru and Kanji Watanabe is a fantastic character."
criterion,ff4fa4c,t1_ff4dny5,1579562219.0,Will do!
criterion,ff3cfb9,t1_ff2t51o,1579538387.0,"Sure! This was my first one, so I literally learned how to make it on a whim last night when I should have been sleeping.

Here are the templates I found for the Criterion logos: [Link.](https://m.imgur.com/a/3Nm9D)

You can then find an image you want for your cover and lay the Criterion logos on top. You could do this in any photo-editing software. You could even just use a slide on a PowerPoint presentation, since it is easy to move around images there. Make sure to include the title and year of your movie. You could do this by adding a text box and picking your font/style, or by finding a logo of the film's title elsewhere and using that image.

Hope this helped!"

dvdcollection,fem58j7,t1_feigz8d,1579240200.0,"Criterion has done more for cinema than most other companies, it seems weird to criticize them for releasing a semi-popular film once in a while."
dvdcollection,fem54tp,t3_epv1e5,1579240096.0,"About a Boy!!! Can't recommend this movie enough, it is a top 20 movie for me. So underrated. Toni Collette gives a subtly outstanding performance, and it's super charming/funny. Don't expect some deep groundbreaking story, it has a pretty standard plot, but it just hits all the right notes for me. Let me know if you watch it!"

socialanxiety,fem4vll,t3_epoo90,1579239843.0,"There are books that you can buy that essentially walk you through therapeutic techniques. I'm sure a quick google search will give you a bunch of good options. But, in principle, if you want to change behaviors, just hold yourself accountable and find ways to push yourself. An example could be, ""I will go to one social event each week,"" or something like that. Start small and reasonable, and gradually increase the difficulty level."
socialanxiety,fem4oj7,t3_eprnnh,1579239649.0,"I blush a lot, but it honestly does help to repeatedly expose yourself to stressful situations. It makes blushing less intense/frequent. One thing that my therapist said that could help is to change your mindset from ""Oh no, I hope my face doesn't turn red"" to ""My face will probably turn red, but it will be okay in the end."" Because if you're putting yourself in a socially scary situation, you likely will blush. The more you resist and fear it, the worse it will be. So it is better to try and accept it, and it will hold less power over you."
socialanxiety,fem4gvv,t3_epuays,1579239447.0,"Unless it seems really sketchy, I would accept the invitation. I also agree with the other commenter that clubs can be great. I am warning you that they are terrifying the first 1-3 times you go, but each time gets easier and easier as you get to know the people/structure better, and it's a great way to build up a tolerance for social situations in a relatively non-threatening environment. Another way is to make friends with people who you are paired with in group projects. Try to start small conversations, first about commonalities you have (an annoying teacher, lots of HW, weather, basic things like that...), and then if you get along you can take it further. Hope this helped!"
socialanxiety,fem43n7,t3_epqfuc,1579239088.0,"Although I like some of the memes, I 100% agree. I think maybe it would be good if the memes were limited to just the weekends, for example."
socialanxiety,fem3z3j,t3_eppuyr,1579238968.0,"And when they hold up the mirror to show you the backside of your head and you give that awkward ""Yup, good, thanks"" even though you're dying inside."

socialskills,fem3m01,t1_felmvmc,1579238633.0,YES! I do this too! I also look up their menus too so that I pick out what I want to order so that I don't stand there with my mouth open not knowing what I want.

stephenking,feihulf,t1_fegkp26,1579138881.0,"There are a number of reasons why Best Director and Best Picture might go to different films. This year, for example, my favorite movie was Marriage Story, so I'd want that to win Best Picture, but I would not give it Best Director since it is a relatively straightforward film. I'd rather give Best Director to a movie like Parasite (or 1917) since the directing in those films is much more impressive."
stephenking,feihlys,t1_fegh1we,1579138724.0,"Totally get it, I just wish movies were awarded based on quality alone. It's also not like the Academy hadn't heard of films like The Lighthouse. If you are in the film industry, you should be aware that these films exist."
stephenking,feihhbw,t1_fefqf4h,1579138639.0,"Absolutely, she legitimately gives one of the greatest performances I have ever seen."

dvdcollection,fdefuel,t1_fddp09d,1578338112.0,"I just mean that The Witch has a clear arc for it's lead character with story beats that you could write in a paragraph or so. Whereas The Lighthouse is more of a mood piece, and yes it does have some unanswered questions in it. There is a decent amount of metaphorical/allegorical work being done too."

criterion,fdd0d0v,t3_ej41uy,1578289848.0,Squid and the Whale is fantastic! It's one of those movies that's uncomfortably realistic at points. Noah Baumbach is great at having really funny and really sad moments in the same film.
criterion,fdd08kl,t3_ejlkfq,1578289730.0,"I actually just watched Royal Tenenbaums for the first time the other week and was surprised at some of the darker themes that Anderson touches on, since I'm so used to movies like Grand Budapest or Fantastic Mr Fox."

dvdcollection,fdcztu6,t1_fdaww2m,1578289328.0,"Lighthouse is incredibly well made, so if you get a kick out of things like cinematography/music, then you'll probably love it. The Witch has a more straightforward story though, so I think I prefer The Witch to The Lighthouse. I would also add that the trailer for The Lighthouse is a very good/accurate trailer to what the actual movie is like."
dvdcollection,fdczlmy,t3_ekky4j,1578289109.0,Taboo is great! Tom Hardy is awesome. Jonathan Pryce is also a real standout. Has one of the greatest scores ever too!
dvdcollection,fbwafoc,t1_fbvqkcu,1577144781.0,"I would highly recommend Thirst. Excellent movie. As for Dracula '92, it is really a mixed bag, but absolutely worth watching. Gary Oldman is outstanding, and it is visually beautiful, but most of the supporting performances aren't great in my opinion, and it has some pretty strange scenes as well."
