The American workforce is a trap:

You need money to live. Get a job? You need college. You need money for college. You take out loans, you go to college, get a job, pay even more money than if there was a job available before u went to college that didn’t have CRAZY QUALIFICATIONS AND SHIT and paid more than 9/hr


Fucking hell"

Yet I’m the one they talk shit about and threaten to KICK out. Not even to my face tho. I over hear them, but to my face they’re so dry and randomly “loving” when they need shit.

TrueOffMyChest,ff3meu2,t3_er5d2z,1579544158.0,"They’re not your friends, sorry. If you talk to them about how you feel and the situation and they don’t change, feel remorse, or you don’t feel any different or better about yourself, then they’re not your friends and you should get yourself out of that situation. You will most definitely find people who support you through anything you do and any changes, maybe not immediately but if you’re doing everything right then just be patient. 

You don’t need to feel bad about something that thousands of people struggle their entire lives to accomplish. I’m really proud of you and so are the people who actually care for you. Please don’t let them get to your head on a deeper level, and do things for yourself and not for other people(not saying you aren’t at all, just saying that would be a good idea).

Peaceee :)"

depression,fedpoti,t1_fed048g,1579017193.0,"That’s exactly what it feels like for me, lightheaded and everything. On top of already getting lightheaded easily cuz of low blood pressure, I do get really anxious “for no reason” and my head starts to feel kinda hot/or red idk and i can’t focus on anything even if I try like my vision seems kinda blurry but not, and I try to ignore the anxiousness or the feelings and think “this isn’t happening/ calm down” and it just doesn’t go away. I mean it does go away eventually but not when I want it to, and like you said “there’s no reason ( at all ) for me to be anxious.” But I’ve only gotten to that point of feeling like I’m gonna pass out a couple of times since I always try to close my eyes, leave, or sit down when it happens."
depression,fecr702,t3_eoaosy,1578981569.0,"I feel the same way. I’m scared to do it or think this but I’ve been considering telling him that we need to take a short break, my mind just isn’t anywhere and I don’t want it to effect him but I don’t want to lie to him also cuz I feel bad for even mentioning that I’m not doing okay. I don’t wanna seem over-dramatic partially too. He’s done nothing, everything is just so hard and overwhelming."
depression,fecqtcf,t3_cml6ni,1578981201.0,"Today I felt happy for a little and went to my room to just chill. When I go there I started to really need to cry and all I could think was “no, no, no, why am I crying, I don’t need to cry, why is this happening to me, I can’t handle this.” 

I don’t know what it was, I wasn’t even sad. 

Yesterday I was out eating with my family at a restaurant casually. I was eating and was just keeping to myself, in a pretty neutral mood, and then suddenly my heart starts to beat harder and my chest felt like it dropped, and my head got a weird feeling. I didn’t really realize how I was feeling at first, I just remember thinking “I feel weird”. Then it got kinda worse and I realized I was getting this same anxious feeling I used to get a lot randomly before. It’s like a nervous feeling, not specifically sure how to explain it, but it happens randomly and makes me wonder if I’m bipolar, honestly but joking. 

This is how I’m doing. Most of the time I’m pretty neutral though, just wondering if anyone else has felt like this before or can relate..?"
depression,fecq8se,t1_fe8twrb,1578980664.0,"I actually did the same thing yesterday, and deleted Snapchat for the second time lol. I kept catching myself talking to people to then realize each time how fake they were being.  No one really texted me first and it’s crazy how you really see who the real people are once u disconnect from everything. 

This is a good step, you aren’t alone :)"
