I’m not sure exactly what equation you used, but I think that’s the right math for the exact 30% increase.

My point was that neutral is normally utilitarian; I didn’t mention the atrocity resulting in deaths and destruction because atrocities doesn’t necessarily imply that, but that would generally also factor in. The reputation loss was because I was thinking about good vs evil actions with the exact same outcomes at the time of writing, and I probably should’ve clarified.

You can technically make a connection there, but it’d just be in your head. I thought about specifying using the leftovers to patch up anyone affected by the deaths later, but figured nobody would attempt to read into it that deeply just to prove a point.

If he begins to take most actions solely based one what he thinks his friend would do, he should inherit the friend’s alignment, or at least what he thinks that alignment is.

They’s probably a better word than logical, but my meaning is that there are no factors that chaos/order and good/evil can cover that affects the decisions of a true neutral, so much of their motivation will be laid out on the table during the campaign, making their choices fairly straightforward, with logic filling the gaps. This is unless the player goes out of their way to make extra orthogonal axes to law/ethics (precedent/consensus), which will probably be pretty alien since those do cover a majority of human decision making."

dndmemes,fdk03p3,t1_fdjyczs,1578492691.0,"Not necessarily. The ethics of their actions do not matter much to them. That’s why they are neutral and not good/evil. Obv there might be a smidge in there that prevents them from committing the darkest stuff, but if you’re on a tight deadline to kill a great evil, and the fastest way to win is to wiping out a few villages, goods will go out of their way to find another solution, evils will use it as an excuse to kill off a few extra for power/gold, and neutrals shouldn’t hesitate on wiping out the minimum.

Edit: I just realized that I forgot the importance of the end goal, since a lot of my reasoning came from a recent comment chain which that was already given to be ""good."" As far as I can tell, the difference between most neutral and evil characters is whether or not the end goal is good/neutral or evil. No this does not necessarily matter to the character. No the character does not get to decide whether or not they are good or evil. That's what everyone else is for. If a paladin wants to purge the world of badly defined ""heretics,"" they would rate themselves as good while by most definitions they would be evil, and so they are evil."

Warframe,fdjmpmp,t1_fdin52a,1578478349.0,"In order to get under 90% armor strip, you need 5.6% (0.1^(1/40 procs)) or less armor stripped per proc. I doubt DE made puncture that useless.

Edit: I just realized that 60 armor actually makes a decently sized difference, but even a 10% strip would reduce armor to 1.4% after 40 procs so ima just assume the math still holds.

Because the ehp pool scales linearly with health and armor, you can visualize the entire ehp pool as 1+effective armor/300 health bars with 300 hp each, essentially. A corrosive proc is equivalent to stripping away a quarter of those effective armor bars, but also needs to strip an additional 75 to account for the base hp bar in order to truly get a 1/0.75 increase in damage.

If you want an example, with the hypothetical armor strip of 50% I mentioned and the 300 armor threshold I gave, the enemy will have 50% DR, so you do 100-50=50% of the damage. Once you strip once, they have 150 armor for 33.3% DR, so you do 100-33.3=66.7% of the damage. 66.7/50=1.333, or a 33.3% damage increase; the nice round number I was going for. If you really need the equations for an exact 30% extra damage, just ask.

Edit: think of this as removing a quarter of the ehp pool."
Warframe,fdht7qf,t1_fdho807,1578429723.0,"Puncture reduces armor. 3.2x is 600-700 effective armor removed, which with pure puncture is equivalent to 800-900. Crew ships have a base armor value of 600, so the crewships were level 12-13, assuming >90% armor strip after 40 procs. They tested their stuff on earth.

However, I did assume a +15% multiplier on slash based on whatever numbers I remembered from killing fighters; I’m guessing my ammo count ballpark was off, unless combined elemental damage is also for some reason used in proc priority despite not having any related proc,  which could easily be a real bug.

With the new numbers, to beat slash, it would have to remove about 75+a quarter of the current effective armor per proc. Basically 25% armor strip+whatever else is needed to fill in that 75 current effective armor. With 25% armor strip, puncture procs never beat slash. With 50%, puncture is better than slash until the enemy hits 300 armor or below. Basically 75/(theoretical armor strip%-25%) is the cutoff where a puncture proc is no longer better than slash, but I  don’t know what the actual armor strip value is so I can’t give a solid number."
