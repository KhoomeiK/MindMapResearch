AmItheAsshole,ff49115,t3_erjuar,1579558179.0,"OP I'm sorry that people are being so damn nasty! If you pay rent, you are a tenant and therefore it is your home. Not everyone's mental health struggle is the same and it's preposterous how people on here can make assumptions about yours when all you want is a ruling on a specific problem you are having. I would say ESH but itf I were in your shoes I would be pissed also. Just because you like a certain routine does not mean you should have to live by yourself. It's your home  and your aunt is a guest. Your mum and her bf sound like they are a bit intolerant of your issues to say the least."
AmItheAsshole,ff48ft6,t3_erk22w,1579557806.0,Nah. I'm sure they won't mind.
AmItheAsshole,ff45jk7,t3_erieyb,1579556013.0,Wtf am I reading. And nta
AmItheAsshole,ff44z35,t1_ff44fs6,1579555652.0,"Yeah. So that leaves exactly 2 teen years left. When someone says teenager they don't think an 18 or 19 year old, rather 13 upwards. 18 upwards is essentially an adult. What's your point?"
AmItheAsshole,ff44dar,t1_ff42tt8,1579555269.0,"That is completely different! He isn't ignoring his own kid, he doesn't owe his niece anything!. You can't compare OP ignoring his niece to OPs mum ignoring him. That's ridiculous."
AmItheAsshole,ff44795,t3_erjig3,1579555165.0,"NTA. You don't like babies. It's not like you are wishing harm on the child. You just don't like them. People think that baby smell is amazing but it makes me physically want to vomit. Drool and snot and food on their faces makes me nauseated. And just because you are related does Not mean you have to build a relationship with the child. I seriously do not understand all these comments calling you TA. Your family isn't respecting you at all by forcing you to be around and hold and spend time with this baby. Ew

Edit: I seriously do not get all these comments calling you a sociopath. SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE BABIES AND DON'T WANT TO INTERACT WITH THEM. Just like how some people don't like people and don't want to interact with people. The difference is with grown ups you can reason and explain why. With a baby you can't. Same goes with pets. Some people don't like pets. You can't force them to love your pet. And they aren't a sociopath for not liking pets. Ffs"
AmItheAsshole,ff43sjk,t3_erjoz4,1579554914.0,"When I read the title I for sure thought you were ta. However, the in laws sound like they have some real controlling and priority issues. NTA for being mad at them for sure. They had plenty of notice and were asked and even offered for flights to be paid for! There is some other issue going on here deffo."
AmItheAsshole,ff43h69,t3_erjpm1,1579554720.0,"NTA. Sometimes people just don't get that other people can't afford the same things as them. You can either have a word with them privately explaining, or make up some excuse. I would have a word with them. Just say that you aren't deliberately trying to offend them, but can't afford it rn, but are very much looking forward to the wedding and being part of their wedding. If they are a real friend them I'm sure they will understand."
TrueOffMyChest,ff41mnk,t3_er7kof,1579553577.0,One time I was making stock from chicken carcass and completely forgot. Dog alerted me at like 3am when it boiled off completely. Saved me from burning my damn house down. Dogs are so pure.

AmItheAsshole,fez8ne9,t3_equynb,1579454858.0,Whoa your cousin sounds like a an absolute piece of work. It's the dogs chair. The dogs house. The dogs rules. Cousin can sit on her scooter. Outside. If anyone was mean to my dog in front of me they can leave my damn house immediately.

AmItheAsshole,fdby2sw,t3_ekctsn,1578263640.0,YTA. not a child? She was 17 dude. That's still a child really. I guess it is hard to separate your anger at her and at her mother. Sounds like a really shitty situation to begin with dude. I would reply and see what's up. Can't really lose anything  by replying right?
AmItheAsshole,fdbx2a9,t3_ekicbi,1578263252.0,Wow you did a really good job explaining it that way. Totally NTA. Well done bro
AmItheButtface,fd8opaj,t1_fd5vwpt,1578221046.0,"The thing is no one's relationship is perfect. One of the things I always see and also hate seeing is "" oh so and so has underlying issues that you need to address and your relationship is unhealthy"". There are loads of things that we learn to deal with in a relationship, and loads of things that will still piss us off. I'm my case, giving my SO his own space to be filthy in works, and he eventually sees how ridiculous he is and gives his room a clean. It's a solution that has worked for me with a messy and gamer husband."

That way, he has zero excuse to keep making a mess and leave clothes everywhere. And you can dump his shit in there and shit the door and have a ice tranquil bedroom. That's what I did with my husband lol. The box room is is closet and gaming room. Any overflows I just dump back in his room and shut the door. Win win"
