boardgames,fekem0f,t1_fekdi79,1579198431.0,"It’s fairly heavy, but once you understand it and have a few games under your belt, you can effectively teach it to someone else within 10-15 minutes. The expansions add quite a bit more complexity, but by the time you’re ready to buy those, it’ll be icing on the cake and fairly easy to incorporate. 

My advice: don’t be to proud to play the game on the very easiest, most stripped down mode available the first few times, it’ll still present a good challenge. (By stripped down I mean playing without adversary, scenario, and blighted island cards, along with playing the least complex spirits. The rule book shows you how to do this and even recommends it, so don’t worry about anything breaking mechanically.)

That and Spirit Island are the two best coop games I've ever played. I compare AHLCG a lot to DnD to people who haven't played it, as your decisions in one scenario ripple throughout the rest of the campaign. 

There's also a novel experience point system that allows you to upgrade your deck, though true to the theme of the game, progress comes with certain drawbacks. A high-level deck is definitely more robust and able to handle more situations, but is also very good at fucking itself over as you have more weaknesses to draw or more physical/mental trauma to deal with. A brand new deck won't have the same level of power, but it won't have the baggage either. It ""feels"" cool to see yourself develop in a very human way, with your virtues and flaws becoming more apparent as you plunge further into the mythos.

The art is also fantastic. Only real con is the game can get pricey if you find you love it, but replayability is damn near infinite."

Instead of really powering the vibration of the string, you’re kind of skating over it for a moment before you finally “catch” it again towards the middle of the bow. This momentary lack of full contact is one of the reasons you’re getting overtones instead of a full throated principle.

Typically, this happens because your bow changes (from upbow to downbow) are not relaxed, and therefore inefficient in transferring weight into the string from your arm. Watching the video, I can almost feel the tension in your thumb, wrist and elbow.

Really practice your bow changes. Try to minimize crunch and noise. Long, slow drones with relatively light weight at a mezzo piano should be good for training relaxation. Try to make the bow changes as inaudible as possible without ever lifting the bow off the string, even for an instant. Feel every millimeter making full contact with the string at all times."
