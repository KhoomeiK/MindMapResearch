Teachers,fesbro3,t1_fes3ksy,1579363611.0,Yes.  We have four 90 minute blocks each day alternating a/b days.
Teachers,fes0j3l,t1_ferxtls,1579360195.0,"One of my 8 blocks is a study hall, in my room, with about 15 kids.  I guess that is my ""duty"" but it's really a working duty since my study hall and I decided our routine involves putting on calm Minecraft music and getting our work done.

Our admin and support staff monitor the halls, lunch duty, office help, late passes, student escorts, etc. To be fair, our 4 administrators work their butts off and are rarely in their offices during the school day."
