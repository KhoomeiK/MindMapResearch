Sustained high heat might extract unpleasant tastes from coffee but the foam is a must in Turkish coffee and you can only get that by boiling it. What I assume happens here is the sand has so much thermal mass they can get the coffee to boiling temps very quickly without spoiling it.

Sort of like how cooking a steak in a thin aluminium pan won't produce the same result as cooking a steak in a cast iron pan."

Unfortunately I can't buy new and return it as I'll sell my Kindle first and buy used."
kobo,fficxoq,t3_eswm6v,1579970896.0,"I'm thinking of switching from an Oasis 2 to Forma (paying about  $40 on top) and I have some reservations:

- The Oasis 2 has a beautiful glass screen, I hear the Forma has a plastic screen, how is the durability? 

- Is highlighting text responsive?

- Is the English dictionary good and adequately fast?

- How is the battery life? 

I want the Forma largely because of the 8inch screen and I like that Kobos are more customizable. However, the Oasis 2 is a great device and does what it does excellently so I don't want to upgrade the screen size just to downgrade too much of the rest."

It means documented measurements. These are the highest and lowest temps ever recorded. We didn't have any means to measure temps in a scientific manner before the industrial age."
