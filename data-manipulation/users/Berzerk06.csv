aww,fggrgk4,t1_fggokty,1580767917.0,What kind of pain meds did you use for this? In a similar situation with 11.5yr old corgi

HomeImprovement,ffuw7z0,t1_ffuik3q,1580250511.0,I hadn't heard of a kill-a-watt tool to monitor how much power's being used. I'll see if I can snag one. Is there a way to use one of these on the water heater or at some point along the heat pump's power delivery to monitor those as well?
HomeImprovement,ffu54f3,t1_fftcltv,1580234692.0,"Appreciate the insights.

At the old house the furnace, water heater, and cooking range were on natural gas. I don't think the clothes dryer was on gas but it was never moved out of place to see. I thought I had read how efficient the heat pumps were but didn't consider they'd be less efficient at colder temperatures, it hasn't been incredibly cold this winter, maybe 20F at the coldest, but it was consistently below 40 since move-in to now from what I can remember.

Our electricity provider is the same so I don't think we had averaging at the previous house, sounding more and more like the natural gas was accounting for most of the ""cheaper"" energy like heating. 

Thanks for the tip on the wood fireplace, I'll see if we can confirm the dampers are closed or something, first time having a wood fireplace but overlooked it's effect on keeping the air in, especially the room we're spending most of our time in. I don't think we have night-time rates because the bill just gives a flat $/kWh."
HomeImprovement,ffrqfpb,t3_eut0gz,1580163530.0,"No advice but I just posted a similar thread and found your after I had already posted. We have gotten $250-300 electric bills since move-in in November. No baseboard heating, only heat pump/mini-splits.

It's very nice, smooth and quick and I was able to get it $100 off. Hopefully I can make this one last 3 years like the OG Pixel."
