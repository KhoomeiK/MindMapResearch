It angered me when TLC aired Toddlers and Tiaras so much. I remember one episode, this mother was working 3 jobs to pay for these hideous costumes for her kid, along with making her practice these dance routines until 3 in the morning. For fuck's sake, the kid needs sleep. Plus, these dance routines consist of the children shaking their butts like a stripper at a nudey bar. Then on top of that, the kids are overwhelmed, tired, crying that they want to take off those costumes, the fake hair, spray tans, veneers and makeup. Those kids don't look like kids, they end up looking like prostitots in an illegal human trafficking ring."

My boyfriend was abandoned 2x by his father after his mom passed away from cancer when he was 14. His father hit him, threw a cordless phone at his head and attempted to kill him by strangling him until he blacked out. He was afraid to tell anyone out of fear of being taken by DYFS and being separated from his brother. The last thing his dad told him when he attempted suicide at the hospital was that he'd never abandon him. He left him there and his aunt and uncle ended up going to court so they could get sole custody of him and his brother. Then my man started hanging out with the wrong people and got into alcohol, weed, painkillers and heroin. He's been sober almost 4 years and what saved him was the Salvation Army in Wilmington, DE. The counselors listened to him and were able to pinpoint why he was self-harming, getting into bad relationships and abusing drugs. Listen to men. They're people."
