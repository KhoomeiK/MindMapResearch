Nah but benefit of the doubt ay, no way Ollie fucking North would lie.  


You credulous tools. Ollie fucking treasonous son-of-a-bitch North has the Countrt's best interests at heart ay?"

Sandinista's did some good things and some horrible things. They were democratically voted in. 
Contras did a lot of horrible things, and then some worse things. 

All they had to do about the Sandinistas was nothing. Don't get involved. The Reagan admin instead supported some of the worlds worst most brutal terrorists,  encouraged them to target civillians, ran propaganda for them, gave them guns, and worked with them to flood the US with cocaine. 
That cocaine made organised crime rich, allowed them to corrupt American society, buy cops, commit murder and get away with it, led to the crack epidemic and inner city gangs, enormous costs to the health system, and an ongoing cascade of crime. 
If they're not fucking traitors to the US,  no-one is."

This is not what you're looking for. 

The Iran/Contra affair is well documented recent history, and a very interesting story too. 

Don't believe this random idiot"
facepalm,febinki,t1_feba9rf,1578959243.0," ""One public opinion poll on Friday had North with a truly awesome “approval rating” of 96 to 4 percent, much higher than Ronald Reagan, Jesus or even pure cocaine.  The Iran-contra scandal that once looked deeper and dirtier than Watergate was suddenly transformed by North’s performance on network TV into something on the scale of American heroism like Valley Forge or MacArthur’s return to the Philippines…. The shameful saga of Oliver North was so heavy and strong that it caused rich men on Wall Street to weep openly and small children in Hollywood to dance and jabber with joy.

    It even brought tears to the eyes of Crazy Bob. “This guy is the real thing,” he said when North went off the air on Thursday. “I want to send him a check.”

    I stared at him for a long moment, then I whacked him on the side of his head. “You fool!” I said. “I’m tired of your lame Nazi gibberish.” He leaped off his stool and went into a fighting stance, but I quickly jumped back and hissed at him: “Semper Fi! Semper Fi! 269 dead boys at Beirut Airport! Two hundred and sixty-nine dead U.S. Marines, Bobby!”

    He stiffened, then dropped his hands.

    “Yes!” I shouted. “And we know who did it, don’t we?”

    “Iranians,” he muttered. “That stinking Ayatollah.”

    I knew he had been in the Navy – nine or ten years in one of the super-elite SEAL units… the Marines get a lot of publicity and they look good on TV commercials, but even drill sergeants at Parris Island will admit that 99 out of 100 Marine recruits would be routinely rejected if they ever tried to qualify for the SEALS. A pencil-necked weekend warrior like Oliver North couldn’t get hired as a male nurse in a SEAL unit.

    I put my arm around Crazy Bob’s shoulders and sat him back down on his stool. “And who was it, Bobby, that sold all those bombs and missiles and rockets to the Iranians?”

    “Jesus Christ,” he said. “It was Oliver North, wasn’t it?”

    “Yeah, Charlie,” I said. “It was him – and he was well paid for it, too. Ronald Reagan called him a great American hero, and George Shultz put his arm around him and thanked him for doing good work.”

    So much for Ollie mania.""

ShitAmericansSay,fa9vq3j,t1_fa9s7fj,1575893848.0,"Mate Europe has some great food. Like how y'all pickle the fuck outta some cabbages, hang yer snags up for a few months, let crazy stinky moulds grow on your cheese, sprinkle anchovies on stuff, kill some real gamey tastey meat. Ales that could count as a fucking meal in themselves. 

Best restaurant around here was run by an old German dude who did just that. But he also married a Vietnamese woman, who did things liie parsley that hurt your face like nettles, fish head soup, chunks of red chilli big enough to choke a cunt, insects, cocunut fat, coriander, soy. 

And occasionally they tried mixtures of the two stlyes that didn't quite work for everyone. They didn't mix tofu and potato tho, or pasta and bread. They added the fucking things that had flavours. Fish, mushrooms. Good shit."
