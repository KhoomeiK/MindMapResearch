He’s also not this dumb so that helps a lot."
AskWomen,fglqrj8,t1_fgllzv9,1580908435.0,"Yeah I definitely don’t think your situation was normal at all! But at least you have the benefit of living on your own and learning all that. 

A lot of my fiancé’s learning curve was because he never lived on his own, which was great as he was able to set his life up and have a good savings. But his mom never made him do any chores inside the house so he had a lot to learn! He’s gotten a lot better though so I try to pick my battles wisely. He does a ton of outside chores as well so there’s a bit more of a balance."
AskWomen,fglkiyq,t1_fgleo8b,1580902185.0,"I’d say she probably didn’t really give you a chance. Yes you should just do chores, but did she mention to you at all how she felt about it? If it was blindsided that’s not fair to you either. 

And I just read you didn’t even live there? That’s a bit much. Unless you were trashing her place or something, it would I make sense to say, wash your own dishes. I would never expect a non live-in boyfriend to say, dust and vacuum my place. I definitely wouldn’t put all the blame on you here.

But if you do ever live with a girlfriend, just read up a bit on some chores, like when and how to do them. Maybe just offer to have “your” chores that you are responsible for. No one should have to do everything, but if you can come up with a way to split duties fairly it’s so helpful."

AskWomen,fgkeaaf,t1_fgjvxml,1580863541.0,"My fiancé does this every single time I try to bring up him not helping with chores or the mental load of chores.

I don’t always want to walk around saying “can you wash these dishes?” “Can you put your underwear in the hamper?” “Can you clean this disgusting toilet?” While also doing everything else myself.

I try to gently bring up that I would like him to take more initiative to help me with these chores, as work longer hours, but 50% of the time he sees it as an attack. Then it’s the defensive “you never asked!” No one asks me! You’re a grown up just do it.

Which never goes well. We work through it well with time but if we could skip the defensive mode I’d be so happy."
AskWomen,fgke0h9,t1_fgjtl9e,1580863365.0,"Oh man I have the same issue, and I feel bad because one day I think the jokes hilarious but then next day it might hit the wrong way.

He always makes jokes that he didn’t hear what I said, and sometimes I end up having to repeat myself 3-4 times which drives me insane! But most of the time I know he’s joking and I just say something different each time, but some days I just don’t want to deal with it.

He also makes a lot of jokes about my depression, probably because I do, but if I’m in a bad enough mood it just really grinds me. But then he feels bad, which I totally understand because I can be “unpredictable” at times, which upsets him."

The only time we had multiple tables were concert nights and that crowd just didn’t tip at all even though we brought drinks to the table. Then they wouldn’t order food so of course they only tipped on drinks.

TalesFromYourServer,fgi8onx,t1_fgi7s3d,1580811446.0,"It’s just so strange for me to think in other countries people actually want to sit at restaurants for hours? Get me home!

I can make my own drinks or pour my own beer way cheaper, from the comfort of my own home in pajamas. If we have a group of friends out for dinner we will either eat and head out to a bar, or eat and go back to someone’s house to relax and play games/watch movies whatever."
TalesFromYourServer,fgi8l1c,t1_fgi4xyz,1580811295.0,"Yes but if your shift is 6 hours and you have 2 campers at a table, $50-60 bucks turns into $20, 

Of course plenty of servers make over minimum wage but if you’re not able to turn tables you aren’t likely to be bringing in as much money, as new tables will be sat in someone else’s section.

Or you have bad luck like me and work somewhere where you’re lucky to get $2 tips, but I got out of that industry after 2 months. Paying out 20% to bartenders even if your table didn’t have drinks and they barely tip you wasn’t my thing."
medizzy,fghacsj,t1_fgh7uyr,1580780370.0,"There are actually a lot of possible benefits (like squatting to poop). It can put less strain on as gravity almost helps the baby fall out, it can decrease the need for tools/vacuums/episiotomies for delivery, it can shorten the depth of the birth canal, and can increase pelvic diameter.

Laying down for neither can actually cause more pain and make labor more difficult, and can limit the babies ability to move properly into the birth canal.

The third link merely says evangelical presence has increased in the chaplains corps, not the military as a whole. One source says the military has poor religious reporting so the number has to be higher - on what grounds? It could absolutely be lower. Another link mentions benefits that outward evangelicals get, could you not assume more people are claiming evangelical to also get those benefits as I did? They highly skews the numbers.

He was a great doctor with great pay, then wanted to be a surgeon. That was fine, he left and did his thing. Then completely had a mental breakdown putting his wife’s job at risk trying to protect him. Then after all the time (and possibly money) put into this training he decides to be a fucking FIREFIGHTER?!?! 

I would have respected another military doc switch more than this. Not even just the money thing but damn. Now he’s gone putting his life in the line, hardly around, his wife is having so much anxiety about his dangerous job she had a damn heart attack. They never should have made him become a surgeon, at least it wouldn’t have been a third career move.

What next? Man I really respect accountants and they have a nice cushy job, going back to school Miranda good luck on ya own again!"

AmItheAsshole,ffeftnv,t1_ffd7rn8,1579846372.0,"Okay but when does OP say she’s a habitual weed user?

His post really only made it seem like she smoked a bit on this trip (as he was worried that her friends smoke and she was headed to a legal state). I’d hardly call taking a few hits of a joint at a bachelorette party once a “struggle to stay clean.”

She’s stupid for doing it absolutely, but you’re consistently assuming she’s an addict off no information confirming that."
AmItheAsshole,ffeflvk,t1_ffdsyyn,1579846143.0,"Where are you getting the info that specifically targeting weed users with drug tests will do that? You mean the guy who used coke/meth/acid/shrooms last night and will probably piss clean is totally fine, or the guy who drinks a fifth of vodka every night but has no alcohol left in their system come morning  are better than the girl who might have taken a few hits of a joint 2 weeks ago?

You can pop hot for weed anywhere from 15-90 days after last use depending on weight, metabolism, weight loss, and usage levels. Honestly until there’s a test that can determine if you’re actually high like a BAC test it really doesn’t mean anything. 

But to be honest if she’s not a heavy user and not overweight she will probably be fine for her test anyway."
