Yes, it would be nice if this received an enthusiastic response from a large group of people. Yes, I do want that confirmation that I can write something that a lot of people will enjoy. It’s true that, at other times, I’ll get upvotes for something of little effort that I realize was more impulsive, less thoughtful, containing a couple of typos and grammatical errors, and replies from people who have valid criticisms, various corrections of facts, or a strong, valid counterargument.

You’re also correct that it’s It really is worth it that I’ve made something just a couple other people enjoyed. And you’re right. We create things that we enjoy. (Forgive me for repeating your comment back to you. I just want to point out how you just summed everything up so perfectly.)

Thanks again for the reply. Take care."
todayilearned,ffb9q4s,t1_ffap165,1579756453.0,"It was a typo. He meant ‘Dick’s Shrinking Pills’. He forgot the apostrophe. You see, Ol’ Richard Feynman — Dick, as his friends called him — patented the miracle human shrinking pill. 

As everyone knows, Richard Feynman wasn’t just a celebrated physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project.  He was also a reviled television producer at ABC. The mastermind behind such beloved science fiction programs as ‘the Time Tunnel’ and ‘Gidget’.

When casting began on the television adaptation of Batman, producers had trouble finding their ‘Boy Wonder’, Robin. ABC execs wanted Batman’s sidekick to be occasionally imperiled at the end of episodes so that viewers would return the following week to see what fate befell young Robin. Unfortunately, acting quality from children in the 1960s was notoriously poor. This was due to Americas widespread use of frontal lobotomies to treat a condition which childhood psychologists today call “being five”. Results from early screenings showed audiences were disappointed when Batman thwarted the Joker’s plan to lower Robin (Played then by Clint Howard) into a vat of sulfuric acid. 

It was then that Dick Feynman briefly left Caltech, shelving his work on his parton model and his efforts to expel female physicists from the university, to work on his miracle shrinking pill in the hope that adult actors could convincingly play children on television shows. Burt Ward was the first adult actor to be offered a job to play a child using the miracle pill. Eventually Ward refused to take the pills but ABC was won over by Burt Ward’s performance as well as photos Ward had taken of them at dinner parties held at the home of educator and science fiction writer Donald Barr. 

It wouldn’t be until the late ‘70s when Feynman’s miracle shrinking pills were put to use on television as former star NBA centers Gary Coleman and Emmanuel Harris found successful second careers as actors on ‘Different Strokes’ and ‘Webster, respectively. Their performances earned both critical acclaim and the hearts of America, all thanks to Richard Feynman and his patented ‘Dick’s Shrinking Pills’. 

This was the proudest achievement of Feynman’s life, but it was short lived. In 1988 the FCC banned the pills after the new Fox Network aired the pilot for the controversial ‘Little Bastards Comedy Hour’ starring Akeem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton. Dick Feynman would die shortly after of what coroners referred to as ‘a Broken heart’. He was thirteen years old."

politics,ff80cmv,t1_ff7bxig,1579662701.0,"Ultimately Sanders is **the** candidate who excites the young and Progressive base and he lost the popular vote in the primaries to Hillary by a considerably higher ratio than Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary. What  can’t be denied is that a lot of Democrats who vote are moderates, Democrats should represent their constituents, the majority of whom are likely more neoliberal than progressive but also more liberal than conservative. 

And, yes, a progressive is better than a moderate Democrat, but a moderate Democrat is better than a moderate Republican, a moderate Republican is better than a conservative Republican, and a conservative Republican is much, much better than the ultra-nationalist fascist currently in power.

Divisions in the Democratic Party will be our doom."
politics,ff7axn6,t1_ff79jpm,1579645030.0,"Sure, but the party is only going to be representative of people who actually vote. Older moderate Democrats vote for moderate Representatives and moderate Representatives are going to represent the people who voted for them, and support moderate Presidential candidates. 

The way we get a party representative of the beliefs of young American progressives is by having more young American progressives get out and vote in massive force, and vote every single election.

Expecting a party elected by moderates to bow to our demands is sort of un-Democratic."
politics,ff79goe,t1_ff77ow2,1579643841.0,"Seriously. My favorite candidate is whoever is the most progressive that’s still in the race. I follow Warren and Sanders on Facebook and all of the comments under a Warren post are “You stabbed Bernie in the back!!!”, all because of *normal* primary friction. (That probably is partly a Russian bot infestation.)

Bernie was taking off in Iowa and the newest poll has Biden back out front. So, it would seem, the corporate media’s efforts to exploit the divide between the two most progressive candidates worked, and we’re going to end up with our second Democrat nominee being what would have passed for a Republican not long ago.

Ultimately a lot of lives and our democracy would be ruined under another four years of white ultra-nationalist fascist oligarchy. 

Any Democrat, and most centrist Republican would mean a world of difference for people who are most affected by the Trump presidency. Simply put, another four years would be survivable for most Americans and most people voting for Sanders, Warren, or Biden. We can’t have either progressives or neoliberals saying, “Well, I guess if my candidate doesn’t win, I’ll just take my basketball and go home and we’ll just let America fall.” Because most of the people with that attitude will be around in four years, for better or worse, children living in cages at the border, black people living under conditions of an actual police state, disabled, sick, elderly people who desperately need healthcare, and anyone else who is seriously harmed by this administration will be pretty much fucked."

CHICubs,ff4zpez,t1_ff3eoie,1579576368.0,"Wow. Thanks. I really wouldn’t be surprised (or mind) if you’re being facetious That’s very nice of you to say. 

I think if you unsub from the toxic subsreddits,  steer clear of /r/all and default subreddits, you’ll find Reddit is actually a very good place for civil conversation. 

There are subs where I’ve discussed a difference of opinion concerning some trivial thing and  had a nice conversation, whereas, on Facebook or Twitter I’d get flamed. For example, someone told me they gave my mom cancer because I wrote that I love Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2. I showed the comment to my mom and she chuckled for a good while and then pointed out that she didn’t like vol. 2 either.

The point is, while Reddit is far from great, and there is a lot of bigotry and volatility on Reddit, if you can subtract subreddits that are frequented by chuds from you’re front page, you’ll find that there are people who are polite even when anonymous on the internet. Those people have my respect, because being a decent person while anonymous is evidence that they’re not phony in the real world, and their kindness is genuine. 

Take care!

YouTube tried to start a streaming service with original content you could access for a monthly fee, and they gave him a show with big financial backing, sort of like the kind of show you’d see on the Discovery Channel back when they were a science channel. Since YouTube’s premium service failed he came back to his regular channel and now all of his YouTube premium episodes are on YouTube for free. All of his videos are full of information and many of the videos he segways  from cool fact to cool fact about topics that are related to each other. Kind of like a stream of consciousness of awesome science facts. 

His channel on YouTube is called VSauce. The TV show on YouTube is called Mind Field."

politics,ff2pxss,t1_ff2i4ut,1579518590.0,"That’s why he and Sanders supporters need to tread lightly. The political landscape is what it is and the thing that matters the most is winning. Bemoaning the unfair treatment from the Neoliberal left and, though justifiably, and vilifying people who prioritize identity politics are only going to cause division in the left and bolster the right who are unified and resolute in their white ultranationalism. 

I say this with tough love: Sanders and Sanders supporters need to  **STOP** **FUCKING** playing directly into the hands of Trump, the GOP, the Corporate media, and Putin. We played into their hands with the #WarrenRefund shit, dividing progressives before a caucus, when Warren supporters would more likely switch to team Bernie, and we’re playing into their hands by vilifying identity politics. 

When it comes to the question Bernie was asked, the more astute thing to say is, “Of course any time the nation elects a minority, woman, LGBTQ+, or religious minority — like myself, it’s a major step forward for this country in demonstrating that the *individual* is most important, regardless of race, gender, sexuality or religious beliefs.” That right there says it’s important to take into account the things minority groups face, while saying the only factor that matters is who is the best for America. Easy. Saying otherwise suggests he is uninterested in identity politics, and whether you agree with identity politics or not, a lot of the left, myself included, **does**. Please note that I’m not saying Bernie said anything wrong, but he has to choose his words carefully. 

So, allow me to argue the best way that I possibly can, why the portion of the left cares about identity politics does so:

Let’s get this out of the way, I’m a white cis straight male in a first world country. None of those factors have caused me to feel or be excluded, insulted, or degraded, and I’ve never witnessed a person in the US who fits those descriptors treated in a way that would trouble me, and I live in Southern California. I am one of only two straight white man in my chorus and we’re treated like family just like everyone else. I live a privileged existence, and I say that as someone who uses crutches or a wheelchair because I was born with Type I Osteogenesis Imperfecta, This has forced me to endure dozens of often excruciating fractures along with small cracks, hairline fractures, compression fractures, broken fingers, toes, and ribs that didn’t require ER visits. My reward for suffering through these ordeals was sometimes bullying when I returned to school. Taking all of that into consideration, I’d still say that I ultimately live a life of privilege because I live in the first world, am a white man, and am straight and comfortable with my current gender. That doesn’t mean life can’t bring hardships to straight, white, cis, Christian men. Anyone can suffer depression. Everyone can lose a loved one. Everyone can have a bad day, and everyone deserves compassion, regardless of privilege. 

While I can’t exactly tell you what it’s like to be a minority, to be trans, non-binary, something other than straight, or a woman. I do think my personal experience may allow for some empathetic understanding. Also, I can say, that I understand being treated cruelly for being different. I can also vouch for the fact that everything from minor slights — Even from well-meaning people — all the up to blatant hatred is something that will be a common occurrence for the entire life of someone who is different. There are ways that my disability makes daily life harder, and it’s a possibility that I’ve lost positions in favor of people who are less competent than I, because the person selecting position feels uncertain that they can rely on the competency of a disabled person. 

Not being comfortable in the competence of someone who is different is an example of bias, and all of us, every single human being has these biases, and we’re usually not aware of it. I am probably responsible for treating someone unfairly, disrespectfully, or lowered my expectations for someone who is unlike me, because I, like every other human have biases. 

We want Bernie to win because we want to move closer to a society where every person has equal political power as a voter, regardless of **ANY** factor. A gay atheist disabled woman making $70k should have precisely the same political power as a straight, white billionaire. 

Having to deal with the economic realities of America lowers our quality of life. People who are not white, are not men, are not straight, are not cis, are not able bodied, are not Protestant face these challenges to a slightly higher degree, and have other burdens in life that don’t affect non-marginalized people. Having a politician who understands the specific issues of identity politics and will fight for them will raise their quality of life. 

Fairly or unfairly, Sanders’ base is seen by some as exclusively working class whites, like Trump’s base. The people who want to sabotage the Sanders campaign will absolutely take his words out of context. The corporate media may be considered liberal, but they’d much rather have Trump than Sanders, even if four more years of Trump ruins a lot of lives. They’re not going to be affected. A Sanders presidency will affect corporate interests. 

There is also some truth to the argument that there are white, working class progressives who don’t understand, and deny the things that negatively impact ethnic, gender, and religious minorities, and women, because those factors don’t affect straight white men, and with any large group of people, you’re going to find bigots, and the disdain for identity politics comes from a place of bigotry, just not as clearly or to the degree that Trump’s base’s disdain for identity politics comes from a place of bigotry."

CHICubs,ff28roy,t1_ff0gbim,1579497130.0,"/u/doogolas33 is on point. I’m used to people generally understanding what I say, even if I word a comment carelessly. We’re approaching something of a second Gilded Age, if we’re not there already. The Progressive Era started as an answer to the Gilded Age and the Progressive Party (Bull-Moose) was formed by Teddy Roosevelt, though he governed as a Republican. Much of the party’s platform was in acted by FDR. Progressivism is still capitalism, but with reforms, regulations, and trust (Monopoly) busting, meant to give the common man as much power as a billionaires, who were referred to as the ‘Bosses’ of the time. It was called the Square Deal. FDR fought (And occasionally exacerbated) the Great Depression with the New Deal. Today we’ve got the Green New Deal proposal. Bringing America back from the brink of oligarchy will probably require a second progressive era.

To answer your question, governments that are more in line with social-Democratic politicians that have successfully administered several social policies with positive would be Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Great Britain, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

If your definition of a successful country doesn’t include individual freedoms, and ignores human rights violations — and if you don’t mind the treatment of South American refugees and the unfortunately brown *American* *citizens* of Puerto Rico, then you clearly do **not** — the Chinese Communist Party is actually doing pretty great."
