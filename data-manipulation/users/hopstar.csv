fo76,ffx4lig,t3_evn3ss,1580317629.0,"Tips from someone who hits max caps on a weekly (or daily) basis:

Common camp plans at 10% of the list price (except the workbench and filter plans, just drop those)

Rare plans: These are all over the map price wise, so you really have to vendor hop and search the market sub if you're not up to speed on what the going rate is. 

Prime weapon plans at 100 caps. They've become super common at this point and no one will buy them for anything more than that.

Ammo: 5.56, .45, 50cal, .308, cryo, and plasma carts sell almost as fast as I can put them in the machine (1 cap each). If you've got stash space you can throw your extra shotgun shells in there, but they'll probably sit for a few days until someone comes along that really needs them.

Fusion cores for .5 caps per percentage, so 50 for full ones, 40 for 80%, etc. Anything below 75 gets dropped or used.

Bulk junk: For the high demand things like lead and acid I use the base price listed. For everything else I go with 75% or so of the list price.

Maps: 30 caps for forest and 50 caps for the rest

Magazines for 25 caps, and bobbleheads for 80.

Crappy legendary stuff: Once my daily scrip is maxed I put them in my machine for 15 caps per point of scrip, so 1 star armor (3 scrip) for 45 caps, 3 star weapons (40 scrip) for 600. If it doesn't sell I'll just use for scrip at some point.

1 star things with a sought after effect (bloodied, junkies, etc) I typically go with 300-2500 depending on the weapon type and effect just based on what I know people tend to use. A 1 star bloodied boxing glove probably won't sell for more than 300, but a 1 star bloodied lever will easily sell for 750-1000, and a 1 star bloodied handmade will get snapped up in a heartbeat at 2.5k

Good legendary stuff: Go to the market sub and use the search function so see if anyone has sold anything similar lately and use that as a guide, or just post a price check and ask for opinions.

Stims at 10, diluted at 5, and supers at 15. I don't typically bother with the rest. 

Other common chems and booze: I price them at whatever the robots will give me (25% of the list price), and pull them out if I'm running low on stash. Rare nukas go in the machine for list price, and if no one buys them I just use them myself.

Serums: I sell them for 200, but I've seen prices ranging from 100-500. I don't know how quickly they sell at 500, but I know that I can make a couple thousand caps per day selling them for 200 so I stick with that.

I typically don't bother with outfits unless I stumble across the responder bot and get something like a hunters long coat, and in those situations I just search the market sub and look for recent sales."
fo76,ffx26ky,t3_evop9q,1580316151.0,"The only thing I've done is to free up a character spot. I had a level 40 something I made early on that was set up as an explosive shotgunner, and after they nerfed TSE guns I gave up on him. 

I moved everything worth saving to my main character and deleted him. Once Wastelanders drops I'll spin up a new character and try to focus their build based around using some of the new weapons they're adding.

I've also been snagging and saving some assorted low level legendary gear so I can give him a jump start. Nothing crazy, just assorted zealots, ghoul slayer, and troubleshooter weapons and armor to take the sting off the early game enemies."
fo76,ffx1g71,t1_ffwu4iy,1580315704.0,"I have 2 low level alts that I use for vending, a level 5 wearing full WWR armor that holds all my excess weapons, and a level 5 with AWR armor that holds all my ammo and rare plans. I know I'm far from the only one doing this, so if you only visit people based on their level you're probably missing out on great stuff.

That said, I wish they'd make the interface a little more descriptive. Separating armor and outfits into their own categories would be a good start, and if they could add something that shows how many of said items are legendary it would be even better. Maybe something like ""Armor 13 (8)"" where the number in parentheses is the number of legendary pieces they have available."
