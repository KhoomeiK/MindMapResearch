Generally the turret can be smaller or the same sort of width as the hull but not bigger if you want a to have a balanced turret and weight. 

If you want a modern example of a turret not matching a hull in size, look at the new Russian T-14 Armata. It has an unmanned turret that is way smaller than the hull. It looks more akin to an IFV (bradley, warrior, bmp) than to a main battle tank."

Composite armor is super thick, multi layered, and for the outside has lots of space. Most of what you are seeing is composite armor. 

Ergonomics. Compared to most WW2 tanks there is more room in the turret for crew comfort and 3 man turret. Also there are lots of electronic systems and such inside. 

Larger gun. Pretty sure this Leo has an 120mm gun and fires super long APFSFS dart rounds. In WW2 the average gun size would be around 75mm. And in WW2 they used much shorter AP ammo.
