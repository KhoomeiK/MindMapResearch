AskMen,ffvy0ly,t1_ffvbde0,1580276796.0,"What is the difference between being a flirt and just normal interactions with a close/best friend (of the opposite sex)? 

I have a female friend that I've known for a while now and we've gotten really close and comfortable talking and being around each other since then. I tell her things I don't really talk to many others about and she's always been there for me when I needed her. I really believe she is an amazing person and I have no problem complimenting her about the way she looks or her personality and she often does the same for me. We confide in each other and she tells me how much I mean to her and it's actually really nice.

I never though this was unusual, but I've never had such a close female friend before her. I've always had trouble opening up and connecting with people, but the past two years have been a blessing on the social aspects of my life. I've met great people and I feel like I have wonderful friendships with people I truly care about and love.

I have a girlfriend now and I'd like to think that I try and go above and beyond for her, but now I'm curious to ask how people would feel if their bf was close to another girl?"
AskMen,ffvrysr,t3_evay0q,1580271568.0,"I think a couple should feel comfortable leaving personal belongings with the other person and feel confident that their partner isn't violating their privacy while they're away. 

I don't have anything to hide and I feel comfortable leaving my phone and laptop with my gf, even though she knows my passwords. I would be unsettled to find out that she is digging through my phone or laptop without my permission to do so. I trust her, and I know I'm not doing anything wrong, so she should trust me.

Trust is one of the basic foundations for any relationship and I feel like this would be a strong violation of that. I would also ask why she felt the need to do this and why she didn't trust me? Have I done something to lose her confidence in me? Is there something that's bothering her?

And also, there are just some things I'd rather keep private. Intimate conversations between friends, my personal journal, and things like that. It's one thing to be involved in your bf or gf's life, it's another thing entirely to invade and police it."

AskMen,ffua7f3,t1_ffu0snm,1580237716.0,"I think that's true in some cases, but it isn't always a bad thing to get to know someone as friends before you start dating. Sometimes it's nice to get to know someone casually and get comfortable with them before you date them. 

Friends can become something more, but I think if you go into a friendship with the ulterior motive of getting with them in the future, then yeah.. you're probably going to be disappointed when it ultimately doesn't happen. I think some people *expect* their friendship to evolve into a romantic relationship and that's a terrible way to think about things. 

I think people need to be reminded that nobody owes you a relationship. Just because in your mind you think that you and this person are going to start dating whenever you finally manage to ""woo"" them and they fall in love with you, it doesn't mean it's true or they feel the same way. Let things blossom on their own, and become friends with them because you enjoy their company and care about them, not because you're looking to date them in the future. If things work out, great! If not, then it's okay because you still have a meaningful relationship with someone.

This is just my opinion though. Relationships are complicated and I'm far from an expert. Some people prefer to just ask random people on dates and that's cool, some people just go through life and eventually they blossom a relationship with someone they already know, and that's cool too."
AskReddit,fft7eb8,t1_fft1hay,1580210837.0,Do you still have the house? I'd cut a hole in the drywall for a special 3DS. Just patch it up.
TheCapeRevolution,fft6198,t1_fft4sfn,1580208966.0,"I get that. I just don't think most people will associate the guy with the cheap, nylon, Superman cape with someone who looks genuinely nice in a well-fitted outfit and stylish cape. 

Yeah, a teenage kid or 20-something year old wearing light blue jeans, white tennis shoes, a t-shirt, and a trilby or fedora looks silly but it doesn't take away from a well-dressed man in a matching fedora. The hat still looks good, and the kid didn't ruin it. It's just that those hats are uncommon because they're not really in style anymore, and haven't been since before trilbys and fedoras came into style amongst younger people who don't really know how to wear them.

I see both sides of the coin here, but I just don't like how exclusionary the sub seems to be getting. If people want to dress different and they look silly then I say let them be happy and participate, but others can take capes in the direction they want to and look more professional or at least more ""put together"". Tbh, I think capes are awesome and I would love to see more medieval-styled  long cloaks being casually worn in cold or wet weather. Kind how they do in movies like The Lord of the Rings or shows like The Witcher."
AskMen,fft5656,t1_fft40nw,1580207682.0,"Oh yeah I totally agree. 100%. If you have to tell someone how smart, caring, nice, honest, and good you are, you're probably either self-conscious or just oblivious to the fact that you aren't one or more of those things. That's what I mean by ""nice guy"" in this example. This also is relevant to any sex or gender.

There's a huge difference between being a ""nice guy"" and an actual nice guy. Generally, the ""nice guy"" will tell you about himself, whereas the actual nice guy shows you who he is or you hear it from someone else. I think if a person is worried about what they are or what they're leaning towards, they should try to figure out how they talk to others and what their motivations for being friendly and helpful are.

For what it's worth, I don't think most people fall into one category or the other, but some people make being a ""nice guy"" their entire personality while others are genuinely friendly, great people, and a blessing to be around."

ffxiv,fft367w,t3_ev2i03,1580204604.0,"That's awesome! I sincerely believe that most FFXIV players are actually nice people or at least friendly. At least that has been my nearly two years of experience. 

I can't tell you how many times I've been in a terrible mood and just felt terrible about my life and I logged in and my FC and friends were there to support me. Most of them didn't know what was going on, but they were always there and happy to see me. I also met my girlfriend and two best friends on FF, so it's been pretty good to me."
AskMen,fft2sxg,t1_fft20tu,1580204024.0,"Just remember that there's a difference between ""caring and being supportive"" for self-validation reasons (like showing someone how great of a person you are, putting yourself on a pedestal so they can look up upon you, or bragging about the good things you do and how great you are) and actually being a supportive, nice person, who cares about them. 

If you find yourself trying to ""support"" someone by tearing down their relationships with others, separating them so that they rely on you more, and doing things with the sole intention of getting together with them, then you're likely just manipulating someone who is vulnerable.

If you find yourself supporting them with the intention of making them happy again, keeping them safe, or for *their own* well-being, then I think you're on the right track. For example, if you are interested in a girl and she gets into a relationship with someone else, but you are still happy for her because they are happy and safe, I think that makes you a nice and supportive person.

The biggest thing I've noticed the posts on /r/niceguys lack are self-awareness. If you are taking a second to stop and think about how you react in situations like this and what your true intentions are, then I think you're ahead of everyone there. I'm guilty of it too."

dissidia,ffszemu,t3_ev2bri,1580199045.0,"I don't know for certain but I suspect it's due to her visual uniqueness and being easily recognized as a FFXIV character.

She still plays an important role in ARR and HW, but even more so in SB and ShB. I think choosing her was a good idea, but I may be a bit biased.

AskAnAmerican,ffsxxi2,t1_ffqucvf,1580197118.0,"Exactly. Just because you don't agree with something doesn't mean it should be repressed.

While I agree that I don't want to see capes become the next poor fashion choice, there's something about this post and how people in this sub criticize each other that is incredibly off-putting. 

Capes fell out of fashion because they weren't really needed anymore, and I know some people don't wear them nowadays because they might feel self-conscious about what others think, and negative posts like this just reinforce that and possibly people back into that ""box"". I'm just a lurker on this sub but I don't see this catching on at all if people are just policing each other instead of letting people express themselves.

Metalfoundry,ffi5xp5,t1_ffi076x,1579965952.0,"Okay, just a heads up. Sand/plaster of paris is a very cheap refractory material and it sort of does work, but it breaks down very easily and you're going to find yourself doing a lot of repairs or having to re-line your foundry every few uses, at least in my experience.
Eventually my sand/plaster lid ended up cracking and some fell into my crucible, so I just dumped my melt.

It also does not do well as a refractory material. I made my lining about 3"" thick, floor, sides, and lid, and it still let out a lot of wasted heat. I could barely get it hot enough to soften and semi-melt copper (I was using charcoal. It will probably be slightly more efficient with propane or coal) I would advise against it unless you really want to get started and only intend to melt easier metals like aluminum.

I plan on redoing everything using a 2 inch thick ceramic wool lined with satanite. They sell a bag of satanite on forging websites for about $40 with shipping and you can get ceramic wool on eBay for less than $15 with free shipping. I'm going to try that and see how it works."

- What kind of rock is Rock 3 and why is it so grainy compared to Rocks 1 and 2? Is it the same type of rock composed of the same minerals or is it something else entirely?"
Aquariums,ff855s1,t1_ff6oqtr,1579666278.0,"That's so interesting. So I noticed that sometimes my driftwood grows a white film on it. Would that be an aquatic fungus or a bacterial colony? My shrimp seem to enjoy picking my wood clean so I don't worry too much about that.

I checked the heater and didn't notice any smell. But it's likely because I cleaned it off already. I'll keep an eye out for new growth though.

This is such a niche field of study but it seems so interesting to me. Do you know of any resources that I could use to learn more about aquatic (specifically regarding aquariums) fungi and bacteria?"
neckbeardRPG,ff7utcw,t1_ff7nrot,1579658880.0,"Nah, I think weebs are more common than you think. I used to think they were rare but as I got older and went to college, I realized pretty much everyone my age is a weeb or a nerd about something.

It's pretty cool tbh. But I think weebs will win by numbers alone."
medievaldoctor,ff6w3yh,t1_ff6syol,1579636094.0,Where's your doctor spirit? Bring it on!
Aquariums,ff6nyra,t1_ff6nd6n,1579631245.0,That makes a lot of sense and I can imagine what that smells like. I'll check when I get home. Thanks for that information. I would have never considered the different smells between fungi and bacterial colonies. But it is probably an important thing to understand and identify.
Aquariums,ff6ng8v,t1_ff6ia6t,1579630935.0,"So basically I'm just wasting money by continuing to buy neon tetras? I really love their colors and I think they match my aquarium and red and blue betta well but I will get a different type of fish.

I was thinking of moving my female betta into the 13 gallon with some neocardinia shrimp and getting my male betta a larger tank. What colorful tank mates could be kept with a betta in something like a 20 or 30 gallon?"
Aquariums,ff6mrmq,t1_ff6ip01,1579630521.0,Thank you. So you don't think I've done anything to cause their sickness?
MetalCasting,ff6mjhc,t1_ff6ifye,1579630384.0,"Gotcha, I'll do that then. Thank you so much. This has been a big source of confusion for me. You just helped me get one step closer to casting! :)"
Aquariums,ff6mf5l,t1_ff6m1oa,1579630311.0,I would smell it but I already cleaned it off. I can try smelling the cleaned rubber and get back to you but I didn't notice any smell when scrubbing it off. By 'proteinous' do you mean slightly fishy? Can you compare it to anything?
Aquariums,ff6m8hl,t1_ff6ih2c,1579630198.0,"If the water parameters are fine and the fish don't seem to have problems with each other I don't think it should be much of a problem right? I'm fine with checking the weather quality and changing the water often, but if there's another problem I'm unaware of I can correct that. Maybe I'll get a bigger tank too. Thanks for the reply btw!"
Aquariums,ff6lrb6,t1_ff6ii7u,1579629906.0,"Yes, from the same source. But I never notice any illness or obvious signs of disease whenever I go that same fish store. All of the fish seem healthy until they spend a few days with me. He mentioned that he doesn't bother heating the tetra's water in the store, but he does turn on the air heater in the store. Is it possible that the disease is dormant until I bring it into my warmer aquarium water?

The fuzz is slimy and does break apart easily. When taken out of water it becomes almost transparent. No smell that I can report on. I'm thinking you're correct that it might be a bacterial bloom, since it seems to grow faster when turning my water temperature up. Strangely it only seems to grow on that specific rubber on the heater, not the filter, suction cups, or glass."
MetalCasting,ff69keh,t3_ervov9,1579622317.0,Vinyl gloves maybe? I'm not sure if it makes a difference but I used to use those in the kitchen to clean all sorts of fat and oily messes.
MetalCasting,ff68rfr,t1_ff65ww6,1579621800.0,I looked at the site and didn't see any shipping prices. $20/22lbs seems great compared to $80/50lbs of olivine sand or $106/50lbs of petrobond on eBay. But when I add the sand to my cart it takes me straight to PayPal without showing any shipping prices. Around how much did you pay for shipping?
lotrmemes,ff5re1t,t1_ff5q5gk,1579607269.0,"It's easy to fly into Mordor when the orcs are in chaos running amok because their big, bad boss just died. They don't really have anything to protect after the ring and Sauron are destroyed. A lot less easy when they have Nazgul, a horde of archers/artillery, a giant sentry eyeball, and hundreds of thousands of orcs that could see them flying in and send reinforcements to Mt. Doom.

Sure you could just rush Mt. Doom with a bunch of dummy Eagles and drop Frodo and Sam off, but the chances are slim and most if not all of them would die. I don't think the Eagles would be okay with that."
MetalCasting,ff5lvn7,t1_ff5l736,1579599307.0,Lol isn't that the truth. That's part of the appeal though. Making something from hand and seeing all of your hard work and frustration paying off. It's a cool hobby that not many others participate in.
MetalCasting,ff5l14r,t1_ff5knm1,1579598011.0,"Thanks for the video. I haven't been casting recently because my foundry is currently in the process of being repaired/reinforced with better refractory material, but this video is also making me want to hurry up and start casting again. Money constraints suck lol."
MadeMeSmile,ff5kcxh,t1_ff5ja65,1579597033.0,"To give credit to him and give people the opportunity to look up his official page. I don't use TikTok but it seems reasonable to me.

I know there's a lot of controversy surrounding TikTok, but yeah. Use it at your own discretion."
bestoflegaladvice,ff5jxvg,t1_ff51s2o,1579596429.0,"Seriously. If a person has the audacity to keep coming back to your home to harass you and try and gain entry, I think it's reasonable to assume they're not there just to have a nice chat with you. I'd be scared to know what they would do if they actually got into the home."
bestoflegaladvice,ff5jhek,t1_ff56yey,1579595775.0,"I know this is incredibly American of me, but it's stories like these that make me glad that my family has access to, and knows how to safely use a firearm. If something like this happened and the people outside actually entered my home, at least we could defend ourselves.

Just imagining a pregnant to-be mother harassed at her own home by two strange people trying to enter is terrifying. If they are actually malicious or intent to do her harm, she should at least be able to protect herself, more than just calling the police.

LAOP should have bought some pepper spray and a few baseball bats, or notified her husband and had him stay home from work one day, and had the police on hold. Any protection is better than nothing.

Edit: I'm curious about the downvotes. Did I say something wrong?"
