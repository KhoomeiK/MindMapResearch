tennis,fgd3w0v,t1_fgd33tp,1580678734.0,"Lol no. They all do it. Delpo has done it, Rafa has done it. Fed did it this tournament.

I remember in the USO a few years ago when djokovic had an issue with his foot and the ump let him stop mid game and it was this big thing. He took off his shoe and was fucking bleeding and people *still* shit all over him.

No. This is bias plain as day. If one can do it, they all can.

And who are you to say when someone is in pain anyway?"

tennis,fgciai8,t3_exox2d,1580672895.0,"I don't mind the meme posts tbh. Even though I'm a Novak fan,I'm a meme fan more. And I don't mind goat discussions either. Honestly I thought Rafa had a good argument at the end of last year too. It's fascinating to realize how many records they've all broken. And they keep doing it! 

That being said, the match threads are getting ridiculous. I don't remember them being so terrible before maybe last year.

I'd been thinking about leaving reddit for awhile anyway due to other shit and even though I'd like to see the memes, I think I need to step back for awhile too. Anything that's good for your mental health."
tennis,fgcfgvx,t1_fgay012,1580672148.0,"Me too. :( As much as I love the big three, I'd have preferred to see him healthy for his entire career. He would have challenged them and the slam count might look very different."

tennis,fg9n8es,t3_exl91r,1580640974.0,"Well, this thread is the most toxic I've ever seen on this subreddit. I'm gonna say GG to Domi and call it a night because the attitude here is depressing me. I don't think the umpire should have done what he did considering the crowd noise and the fact that it's a final, but I do think Domi deserves the win if he keeps playing this well, and Djokovic should be able to come back from it, which he hasn't.

Hope some of you assholes get a life."

tennis,fg9c37p,t3_exl91r,1580636797.0,I really hoped the Australian crowd would give djokovic some love. It's his home court. I know it'll just pump him up but it makes me sad.
tennis,fg9bisw,t1_fg9avrh,1580636607.0,Imagine thinking Rafa would be doing any better. Thiem actually has a chance.

GenderCynical,ffvcz88,t1_ffvc9kq,1580261206.0,"Well, there are definitely lesbians who want to have kids and even give birth, but yeah there's a big difference. One of the things my friends and I discuss is the expectation in straight culture that you are dating to look for a sperm donor/ incubator and it has little to do with partnership. Hence subs like r/arethestraightsok. It's a big problem for straight cis people, and queer culture is much healthier about the question.

It's still something I'd discuss because most people want kids, to my constant bafflement. Now it's not such a big deal because I identify as a gay man and I no longer have the parts to do it."
GenderCynical,ffvcfsb,t1_ffv6r63,1580260845.0,"God I roll my eyes so fucking hard when they say this shit. Like no, I just want to get a Brazilian without having to check ""woman"" on the site to access it. They want to complain that people shouldn't have to wax penises - which they're correct about, as it requires special training - but if it says ""we wax women"" that's problematic. Because trans women are women and trans men are men.

Seeing a lot of terf rhetoric makes me paranoid about it. It's definitely not helping."
GenderCynical,ffv980q,t1_ffusgzp,1580258683.0,"You think genital preferences are transphobic? What?

I said earlier in this thread that I've worked through things and will date afab people, but I have a fuuuuuck ton of dysphoria surrounding my genitals and tbh I don't like being reminded of that. Kinda hard to avoid with my face in a pussy, no?"
GenderCynical,ffv65dd,t1_ffu2o0e,1580256600.0,"This is a good point as I've been struggling with it myself. Is it internalized transphobia or misogyny that's leading me to shying away from dating trans people? I thought: I like men, I like dick, I like semen. I like being fucked and having it give my partner physical pleasure. I do not like vagina. I am rarely emotionally attracted to afab people.

But you know what? I recently asked a close friend out, and she's a mildly gnc woman. Granted, we are both poly and I could still get some dick, but... I'm attracted to her as a person and that's what mattered. Like, I did some serious self reflection and that's what it boils down to - sure, I have an ideal partner, but so the fuck what if I'm attracted to something different? Isn't it people who matter?

How many terfs would consider that? How many anti trans gay people would? I don't think it's much to ask. I know it can be hard, and you might not come to the same conclusion I did, but jeez, what's wrong with asking for some self reflection?"

That being said, I will say my sex organs function differently (and less.) I expected orgasm to change but I did not realize atrophy would occur pretty much right away. I couldn't have vaginal sex even if I wanted to and I'm just over a year on T. That isn't a loss for me, in fact it's a feature. And not all afab people react to T that way. But it is a possibility."
GenderCynical,ffr5yxf,t1_ffr03ca,1580151185.0,What they don't get is that they *are* normal. LGBTQIA are all within human nature. It's their insecurity and our culture that drive them to want to punch down.
GenderCynical,ffr5r4n,t1_ffr42va,1580151051.0,"I am curious about something though. I imagine balancing hormones would work in some sports, and you're right in that that's how hormones work.

That being said, aren't there sports that people who have gone through male puberty first would have an advantage in? I don't know enough about how those things might affect specific sports, but I feel like there probably are some that are affected by height or a slimmer pelvis.

On the other hand, there is natural variation everywhere. A man who is five seven will have the same disadvantage in men's tennis that an afab person who is five seven will - it's an uphill battle either way.

Idk, I'm honestly torn on the issue. I tend to lean towards your side, but I also can't help but feel that say, Novak Djokovic would dominate every single major on the women's side even after two plus years of HRT, even against women with similar height and build."
