Do you eat sugary foods, that you wouldnt normally,  when you get the munchies? If so i would bet everything that its the shock of the sugar.... or if you find yourself refraining from eating,  or sleep excessively longer than normal it could be sugar withdrawal.   I woukd look at your activity and behavioral differences to see if it could be something you're doing while stoned,  and not the cannabis itself , before being certain.
