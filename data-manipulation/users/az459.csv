WTF,feychuf,t1_fey9saf,1579443740.0,"I agree 100% with you. Awesome to find another OnA fan! Tbh though Jim’s current show with Sam Roberts is mediocre at best. I mean don’t get me wrong I love Yimmy but Sam is just awful to listen to. His sarcasm and type of humor tends to go overboard and seems too high on himself. And it’s not even funny sarcasm too imo. 

Jim Norton needed to pair with Ant. When they were together on the OnA show it was truly magical. The way they would just back and forth off of each other was like none other. It should have been them two getting a show together. Maybe one day. Hopefully soon.."

news,fewl2er,t1_fewh7j5,1579413207.0,"Your missing the point. There’s no need to voice anything if MLK day is a holiday that is nationally observed. The holiday needs to be respected. Banks are closed. Do I need to write to my congressman and start a petition so I can make a deposit that day? Do I need to get my local community involved to make the postal service work so I can get my bills mailed to me on Monday? Obviously not. They’re closed period and nobody questions it. And for the school, choosing another make up day that doesn’t fall on MLK should have been obvious for them too. You don’t need parents for that. Common sense which is what public schools clearly lack."
news,fewfwso,t1_fesqek9,1579409923.0,"I get your point about the parents not responding but to use your own words, my point is simple too. It’s a national holiday. The U.S. postal service is closed and so are all banks. Monday is not a business day. Schools should be closed too plain and simple. Did the school district not realize that this would cause controversy? Sounds like they did to me and chose to anyway to draw attention which they successfully achieved. Here we are debating about their decision. 

There are plenty of other days they could have chosen and not specifically MLK day. Why not take away a day from spring break which most schools give students the whole week off. None of the days that fall on spring break fall on a holiday. Easter falls on Sunday so that doesn’t count obviously. Or why not add those snow days to the end of the school year? There are other options."

todayilearned,fdfh5ld,t1_fdfg06b,1578361583.0,Fuck you for saying he’s an idiot. You are nobody to judge and criticize his decision. If that was the path he chose then so be it but don’t insult him for choosing to help others. That’s an oath officers promise to themselves and their community once they become officers. I can only imagine when 9/11 happened in NY what people thought. Especially officers and firefighters. But people will always criticize and talk shit no matter what the situation is.
