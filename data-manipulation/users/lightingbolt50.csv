It's the same reason America didn't take more territory from Mexico after the Mexican-American War, even though it easily could've. They only took the sparsely-populated Northern territories that it could repopulate with white settlers. That wouldn't be possible in Yucatan.

Further, it would've meant fighting a guerrilla war in the jungle against the Maya. That's why Yucatan wanted to be annexed, because they weren't able to fight back against the Maya on their own. Eventually, they had to submit to rejoining Mexico in return for military aid."

neoliberal,ffkbiev,t3_eu29t6,1580020066.0,"Very unimpressed with the options this election. I was so enthusiastic about Grant four years ago, hell, I probably owe him my life. But his administration has made it abundantly clear that being a good general doesn't make one a good president. He is no Lincoln, that's for sure. 

Grant has failed to reach out and sell equality to the South. He should have been hard at work trying to convince poor whites of the Federal Cause with social programs and jobs. Instead, the southern economy continues to decay and poor whites are blaming it on blacks and the union. Instead of upturning the whole plantation system, slaves are back at work for their old owners as ""sharecroppers"". At this rate, reconstruction is doomed, regardless of who's elected. Without a native political base of support for equality, all the progress of reconstruction will immediately be reversed the moment federal troops leave, whether that's tomorrow or 10 years from now.

I guess I'll hold my nose and vote for Grant, but I don't really care. When I watched my buddies die one by one at Shiloh, I tried to comfort myself by telling myself that their deaths weren't in vain, that we were fighting for something greater. With every day that goes by, it becomes clearer and clearer that I was just lying to myself."
