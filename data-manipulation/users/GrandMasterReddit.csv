The sad truth is there are more people than there are goods and that's what causes war and separation, not that people are unenlightened. Sure you can argue all you want about other factors but the truth is if every society on earth was self sufficient, then there would be absolutely no reason to fight. Unfortunately this problem keeps growing and growing at an increasing rate and we can't just change this societal structure over night or even over time for that matter if this problem keeps growing. This problem could be eradicated by introducing certain technology that would make it easier for humanity to take some steps in the right direction. 

Also through the use of the internet, humanity as a species are more connected and educated than ever before. There's barely any room for indoctrination in this world because for the most part anybody from almost any part of the world can just log into the internet and see the unlimited amount of viewpoints people have to choose from.
