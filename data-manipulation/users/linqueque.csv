acne,fffs7u3,t1_fffidod,1579890660.0,"You have to use the toner consistently once a day if you’re sensitive but if not, 2 times a day. You gotta be consistent. And do this for 2 months for results."
acne,fffi87y,t1_ffejrmc,1579884524.0,You need a toner with salicylic acid or a moisturizer with salicylic acid. I use clean&clear toner with 2% salicylic acid. Washing face with salicylic acid won’t help much as you wash it off right away.
acne,ffdh84v,t3_esyhfq,1579820808.0,Introduce an active ingredient and use it for 2 months. For example salicylic acid.  Then switch if doesn’t work.
entertainment,ffamyek,t1_ffaih6b,1579739732.0,"Slaves were used for the purposes of serving. Same as animals are used for the purpose of food. And the slaughterhouse causes a life-long pain (until death hits), because the conditions these animals must endure are awful. Slaves were treated better than that even. Both ; people and animals deserve the recognition and deserve to be free.

And that might have been true in the past when people used to hunt. But these days we don't need to eat meat. So it's different now."

entertainment,ffa99dj,t1_ff9xzqe,1579730368.0,How are they different ? They both cause pain. And in this modern world we donâ€™t need meat to survive. More and more people are going vegan for so many good reasons ðŸ’•
entertainment,ffa8ztx,t1_ff9y1rk,1579730220.0,Thereâ€™s no difference.

insanepeoplefacebook,ffa8cbj,t1_ffa0yh6,1579729857.0,Exactly!! Compare it to how much harm carnivores do.  These two are not comparable.
vegan,ffa65ti,t1_ff9un3w,1579728642.0,Thatâ€™s awesome !
vegan,ff9rhzk,t3_esf0ya,1579719517.0,Do they add b12 there or is it naturally occurring ?
vegan,ff8zqv0,t1_ff8mqe4,1579701125.0,Itâ€™s a white lie.
acne,ff8zpj6,t1_ff8983l,1579701094.0,Nope yaz was the first. I wish her luck. Hopefully she can stick with it because this was a miracle pill for me.
acne,ff88m6m,t1_ff86l9u,1579669180.0,"I took yaz as well. I saw effects after about 3 months. 

I did not have any negative side effects like worsening of acne. The acne stayed the same or just a bit worse but nothing dramatic.  Yaz has made my face completely clear and my acne was very severe. I did not want to leave the house at times. 

Iâ€™d say give it a shot. Itâ€™s highly recommended for pcos not only cause of acne right but also cause it raises risk for some diseases related to pcos. So definitely give it 1-3months"
vegan,ff88877,t3_es6y1k,1579668835.0,"Itâ€™s hard to not be angry. But trust me, being an inspiration rather than some angry person will yield better results. The boyfriend will need to cook some of his food. You have to allow this, this is his home too. But indeed he has to cook it himself. Youâ€™re not required to cook for anyone but yourself. Have a honest and calm conversation about this new lifestyle change and tell him you respect his choices and ask him to respect yours. And say you canâ€™t afford for him to be eating out all the time. I bet there is some veggie dishes he will still like that you make , you can use fake meats and experiment with that. 

I feel like this is what awaits me in the future when I live with my boyfriend lol he is not a vegan but is interested in trying veggie dishes and doesnâ€™t mind them. I was never pushy or blaming him for his eating habits. I can see that being calm and an inspiration yields way better results :)"

acne,ff0pxu5,t3_eqz5lw,1579471202.0,I have the same problem. Some acne all around but my concern areas are chin and neck. 100% hormonal. Birth control works but shouldnâ€™t go that path for minor acne.

Cringetopia,fetn5zn,t1_fetm5yu,1579377085.0,"Species that invade our home can carry serious diseases and aren't just inconveniences. Once we get to know that our action has bad effects like buying a brand that treats their workers unfairly, it's natural we will stop supporting that brand. Same with animals once we learn how cruel the industry is, we probably should stop supporting it."
Cringetopia,feth15d,t1_fesvt40,1579375369.0,"We can't minimize suffering of bacteria and insects if we accidentally step on them or something like that. But we can make a conscious decision to not eat animals. Why is it so hard to comprehend? veganism is about MINIMIZING your impact to the extend possible, doing a conscious effort. I think you're missing the whole point of the lifestyle. And sorry i meant living sentient beings. To be 100% vegan we would have to commit suicide and of course no one is going to do this lol. I mean even medicine we use to save our lives hurt the animals by testing it on them, however are we going to refuse medicine that can save our life? no. It's about doing your very best!!"

Cringetopia,feslo4u,t1_fes2gm1,1579366532.0,Atheism doesnâ€™t involve other living beings at stake. Nothing is at stake there. Huge difference. Vegans are literally against ANIMAL CRUELTY. Which is awesome !
Cringetopia,feslhcf,t1_fery4em,1579366467.0,It it wrong to point out itâ€™s wrong to kill and slaughter ? I agree itâ€™s better to inspire than be negative and pushy however itâ€™s not ok to put vegans in a negative light since they are literally against ANIMAL ABUSE

vegan,fehyi4k,t1_fehfcbs,1579126428.0,I see yeah a lot of sides to a story on this. Maybe the purpose of such burger is not to appeal to vegans but to appeal to meat eaters and encourage them to at least reduce meat.

socialanxiety,fe63y9y,t1_fe595cz,1578881245.0,Itâ€™s not but It was just my idea. Also doctor can prescribe you some meds you take only when you need so it will make you relaxed at the moment.
