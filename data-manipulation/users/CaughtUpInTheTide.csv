ExNoContact,ffjk4b9,t3_ett1iv,1580000043.0,"This is one of THE BEST posts I've read on this sub. Hands down. Everything was so true and accurate! NC WORKS PEOPLE. I did NC to get over it and we didn't talk for like 2 months and boom he reached out and well, idk it's kinda my choice if we get back together. But it's like one of those things that when you have it- you no longer want it. But when you don't have it and they're no longer an option you *crave* it so badly. I just had to position myself close enough to want it, but not to where it was impossible to reach. Literally the one way to settle my thoughts bc for a hot sec I really thought I was depressed or had bipolar disorder deadass."

ExNoContact,ffaj9eu,t3_esfkc3,1579737095.0,"Though sometimes it does aha...I have to say NC does work. It depends the people and situation. I think life is too short and if the breakup was over something mundane, it is different than if it was over lets say gas lighting. It really really is situational"
