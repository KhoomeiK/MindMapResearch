PSHHHHHHHHHHH"
food,fgg4gn7,t1_fgfl6r3,1580754047.0,"You need lots of oil in your pan to essentially fry it. I'm talking a good quarter inch of oil. You can use butter for a nice, neutral flavor. I've also seen people use olive oil, but I personally don't like how it tastes. I love using coconut oil, then topping them with bananas, whipped cream, dessicated coconut, and chocolate if I'm feeling indulgent. It takes a little practice to get the temperature right, but I never cook pancakes on a lightly greased pan anymore. You gotta fry 'em!"
TheRightCantMeme,fge1wz6,t1_fgdrr94,1580689649.0,"I had a cat thay *loved* to be carried. As soon as I would walk in the door, he would trot over, meow loudly, and stand reaching up my leg. If I didn't pick him up right away, he would let his claws out on my thigh. After picking him up, he would loaf in my arms contentedly while I walked him around the apartment for a few minutes."

No, they aren't. 

They *can* be really sweet. They can also be straight up evil sometimes. When my older kid was 2 and the younger one was 1, she would pinch her, push her, or steal a toy and run away laughing when her baby sister started crying."

RoastMe,fg52kv4,t1_fg4efwa,1580516727.0,"Right, but he doesn't care that much, which can be assumed he has more going for him than his looks. Her on the other hand, has to hike her shorts up into her asshole to distract from the fact that she is a condescending, vapid, bitch."
RoastMe,fg3qmrj,t1_fg2su6p,1580487565.0,"Obviously! She knows she's more conventionally attractive than him, so she posts on roast me, knowing she'll get underhanded compliments while people are trying to insult him. Strokes her ego to know that someone thinks she's hot. He doesn't seem to care because he's come to terms with not being attractive. But when it's all you used to have going for you and it begins to fade.... Apparently you are cool with letting others insult your ""bff"" if only for that sweet sweet compliment, ""He has a sock named after you"""
RoastMe,fg3q5g0,t1_fg2sgnj,1580487272.0,"Lol ""insanely hot"". 

Gap-toothed, fake hair, posts on roast me with her ""bff"" as a shield in order to feel better about herself. The only way she can manage to get compliments like this is by selling out the only guy who puts up with her toxic bullshit."

antiMLM,ffvsng0,t1_ffv7h5k,1580272109.0,"Honestly it's often not even that the stay at home moms are desperate for money. Most of the mlm huns I know are actually middle class if not upper middle class. They would be fine to just watch their children. But something about our society makes women feel worthless for not contributing financially. Watching children is not enough. So, even if it actually is a drain when you take out her time and effort, just being able to put a check in the joint account every month can absolve a stay at home mom of all the guilt of ""not contributing""."

I used to think homosexuality/bisexuality was a choice. I spent a lot of my pre-teen years rolling my eyes at everyone who ""chose"" to be gay because obviously they were just doing it for attention.

AskReddit,ffuav1g,t3_ev9knq,1580238108.0,I like to pick my nose before bed. I just can't sleep with boogers in there and the easiest way to get them out is just reach up there and pull them out.

The rules of language are there only there to make sure we can disambiguate what others say when it's a complicated sentence. If someone's sentence disobeys the rules of language and you don't understand what they mean or you suspect they meant the opposite of what they said, you should correct them. If the grammatical error didn't change the meaning of the sentence, you are an asshole for correcting them, especially in a casual setting."

MurderedByWords,ffr9ugf,t1_ffqxj0y,1580153590.0,"Especially for children. Libraries are a safe place that children can be without having to buy anything. For families that have a rough home life, it can be a godsend. I know a young mother who, through a series of unfortunate circumstances, lives with her abusive grandfather. She basically lives at the library with her young son during the day. They read books together, go to storytime, do crafts, she can go on the computer and look for jobs or send emails. It is a wonderful public resource."

He validates my position as a stay at home parent and supports all my other ambitions as well (working on my art and volunteering). He takes care of the finances so I don't even have to worry about it, but always shows everything to me if I ask to see our budget."
MadeMeSmile,ffheklm,t1_ffg8gt6,1579932019.0,"This comment will probably ring in my head everytime I cry in front of my children. I hope you realize that. I know the risk I took when I became vulnerable on a public forum, but I took that risk because I know I'm not the only parent to have struggled with depression. Please, if you ever meet a parent that is struggling with depression and they open up to you about it, don't accuse them of abuse. 

I am lucky that I have a good support system and even when my depression has been bad the episodes last only a couple hours before my support people swoop in. I have their words of encouragement (that my children are resilient, well-loved, and cared for, despite my bad days) to drown out your accusations. But not everyone has that.

If you are truly afraid for someone's ability to take care of their children, offer to help or make a call to child services. Accusing someone of abuse will only make them feel more isolated and anxious."
