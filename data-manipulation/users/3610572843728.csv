That's not how federal taxes work. You only pay 22% on income made within that range the rest is paid at a lower tier. If you make $38,701 to $82,400 a year the actual effective federal tax rate you will pay is 9.02% to 14.85%. that's also assuming zero deductions. With those deductions you'll pay noticeably less.

If you were to actually be paying a 22% effective tax rate before deductions you would need to be making $212,300."

LateStageCapitalism,fgl9j4y,t1_fgktmz7,1580887004.0,"Yes. Bloomberg as mayor introduced a lot of things that Trump would never consider. He raised taxes across the board for everybody. He pushed for a mansion tax which is much better than the one that was passed after he left. He is incredibly passionate towards gun control. he created the idea of a 311 number for citizens to call in to get information about the government similar to the freedom of information act with the federal government. 

His time in the private sector is also proved extremely valuable. He created the NYC Media company which is public broadcasting Company that focuses on New York city-based media. It is gone on to one multiple Emmy awards and is now the biggest local broadcaster in the nation. 

He's very big into preserving local landmarks such as admirals row. 

He believes in public transportation and typically took the subway everywhere himself. Revitalize public transportation believing it was a key thing for the success of the underprivileged. He fought hard against raising the subway fares once again believing it disproportionately affected low-income individuals. 

When he took office the city had a deficit of $6B a year. When he left it had a surplus of 3 billion a year. He is a strong fiscal conservative does not believe in borrowing from future generations and leaving them with a bill to deal with like what we've seen the boomer generation due to the new ones. 

He once rode a bike across Manhattan as part of a public transportation initiative. riding a bike alone is something Trump could never do for more than a few feet if at all. 

He passed a program called Opportunity NYC that was in part paid for my him personally. It was a program to give money towards low income parents for completing certain things such as having their kids having a certain attendance rate at school and directly paid them for doing certain things like an attending parent-teacher conferences. The idea behind paying them was it means they could afford to take time off work to take a more proactive role and their kids education. It gave several hundred dollars for every child in a low income family to go to a doctor for a non-emergency check up. once again the idea was for low-income families who do not have health insurance they'd be able to afford certain basic medical Care. That's why I've no doubt if he thought he could get it done he would advocate for universal health Care in America. 

One big thing he did if you remember that was large on Reddit was a ton of mayor's got together and agreed to pass their own version of the Paris climate Accord. that initiative which Trump tried to sue to stop was the brainchild of Bloomberg and it was him who went around the country recruiting mayor's to join him."
LateStageCapitalism,fgkeb4t,t1_fgkcrre,1580863556.0,No. Just look at all the Bloomberg ads. They pretty much exclusively attack Trump. Then you have Trump attacking Bloomberg on Twitter and the like.

Bloomberg owns 88% of Bloomberg LP. A private corporation whose number of potential buyers is extremely limited. 

Bloomberg does donate billions though including the single largest donation to a college ever. He focuses his donations on gun control and education mostly. If you go to college in NYC and received a lot of scholarships odds are you received at least a couple of dollars from Bloomberg. About 20 years ago I received ~$30,000 from a scholarship he  was funding. He is in part how I was able to afford college."

LateStageCapitalism,fg4rwlm,t1_fg4nomb,1580509757.0,"So to begin. Like I previously stated, taxes can be seen as two key things. The obvious is they are the source of revenue for the government. The less obvious is the Punishment part. Tariffs which are a tax on imports are the most commonly thought of punitive tax. The truth is that all taxes are punitive to a degree. They punish an activity that you may or may not want to happen. So if you don't want people to buy alcohol you put a sin tax on it. If you don't want people to import steel you slap a tariff on it. If you don't want people to spend money you increase sales tax. 

That's the issue. A high sales tax is effectively punishing people for spending money. The poor will still need to spend dark slate all of their money so high sales tax will decrease how much money they effectively have. They will buy less things overall which will slow down the economy as less items are being bought and sold. The rich on the other hand will have a significant quality of life people because money that normally would have gone into savings is now going into covering their purchases. The other alternative is they start cutting back. If they start buying less the tax generated will plummet. one of the reasons why you want an income tax and not a sales tax is because income is much more consistent than consumer spending is. Unpredictability is never good. 

Then there's the fact that the spending is not proportional. For the purposes of simplification let's say I make exactly double the medium income. I won't necessarily be spending double. I won't need two houses, two cars, two TVs, etc.  So a flat tax on sales won't be proportional. 

Then you have another big problem with sales tax. That's one of the reasons why sales taxes are often bad, especially for non tourists destinations. Sales taxes make it more expensive to buy stuff. If the United States government a federal sales tax that was very high it would encourage spending overseas and discourage tourism to America. It would make going on vacation and shopping overseas much more attractive to the wealthy. Big ticket items like planes, boats, etc would become much cheaper to buy another nation even when you include the cost of getting to that nation and back. The US government would lose 100% of the tax revenue and the wealthy elite would completely avoid paying a large amount of taxes that the non wealthy who cannot afford to fly to other nations to purchase their goods will be required to pick up their slack.

It's completely preposterous to simplify an incredibly complex issue by simply saying it's from an increase in money supply. It is an incredibly amateur mistake to overly simplify complex things like what you are doing with inflation. In fact the textbook definition of inflation and what causes it do not even mention an increase in money supply. It is absolutely a main cause but is by no means the number one cause. You statement is acting as if it is the dominant cause and the other can be dismissed."
LateStageCapitalism,fg4khqy,t1_fg4jl7b,1580505142.0,"The cost of the automation still eventually comes down to the cost of labor. The robots are built by humans and the programming is made by humans which is a labor cost. the raw materials of those robots is also as previously mentioned ultimately a labor cost. 

the only time labor costs will no longer be a significant factor as if the entire process chain is made by robots. If robots are doing all of the mining as well as turning those raw materials into parts and building themselves plus fixing themselves when they're broke then labor will eventually be factored out. Even then the programming is still done by humans which means that would have to be automated out as well. 

Once that happens it's likely that we would stop using money, or money would become worth far less and instead the cost of things would be based on how many robot labor hours it takes to make something. At that point there would either be massive wealth and equality as the owners of the robots become the only people with actual money or the government would need to step in with high taxes on the automation and guarantee a basic income. Large companies would likely favor the high taxes and guaranteed basic income because it would help keep the economy moving which is how they would make money. Most companies would rather be very rich and a prosperous society than incredibly rich in a dystopian one."

LateStageCapitalism,fg4dyk3,t1_fg44fu4,1580501709.0,Not entirely accurate. Any increase in the availability of money can cause inflation. if banks could suddenly loan people more money cheaper to buy cars people would be inclined to spend more money on cars. That's why one of the most widely accepted reasons on why college is getting expensive is because of the availability of cheap Federal loans and lack of regulations to prevent companies from taking advantage of those people with the cheap loans.
LateStageCapitalism,fg4dtcf,t1_fg41iwl,1580501634.0,">In real economics terms, inflation doesn’t happen unless newly issued money is introduced to the aggregate money supply. A raise in minimum wage is not printing new money, it is redistributing it to the lower waged worker.

Economist here. That is completely inaccurate. There are tons of factors that determine inflation and one of those factors is based on with the lowest paid workers make. If the lowest paid workers have more money to spend on something then companies can raise prices to match that increase in their available money.  if you suddenly were paid twice as much as you were before you could pay more in rent and you can pay more for food, gasoline, etc. As those prices go up because they can that is one of the factors that would cause inflation."
LateStageCapitalism,fg4djp3,t1_fg3ubzb,1580501475.0,">Prices aren’t directly correlated with wages. No product has 100% of its cost tied up in labor. 

Eventually everything comes down to the price of labor. You may think of something costing 50% labor and 50% parts, but those parts may be 50% labor and 50% raw materials to make. Then the cost of those raw materials is almost entirely dependent on the cost of labor to get them. Any tools but the laborers may use to mine those raw materials is the same way eventually they're made up of raw materials and the price of those raw materials is dependent entirely on labor."
LateStageCapitalism,fg4dc1w,t1_fg4999n,1580501345.0,"Economist here. That is an absolutely terrible idea. You want taxes to be highest on the sources of wealth and lowest on the end users. basically you want to punish people for holding onto money instead of letting it trickle down. what that means did you want to tax businesses and ultra high income people the most while taxing super poor people the least. the reason is if a company has to pay a huge amount of income taxes they're more likely to spend that money on things like employee wages or research and development. If you tax a poor person a lot it does nothing but punish them as they were going to spend every dollar they could get anyway. 

Because of that things like sales taxes are inherently bad. If we were to replace sales tax entirely with proportional income tax increase we would be much better off. Although doing that would not be as easy as it seems."
LateStageCapitalism,fg4d2q7,t1_fg497g0,1580501186.0,"In general technology goes down in price. both because the cost of research and development goes down as well as manufacturing costs go down. 

Then there are some things that while they don't go down in price they hover around the same when you factor in inflation that is. For example cars. When factoring in inflation the average car cost 4% more than it did 20 years ago. Even though the average cost is significantly better in everyway and takes significantly more labor to manufacturer. thanks to increases and overall productivity as well as the cost of technology going down cars basically remain steady in price."
LateStageCapitalism,fg4cexo,t1_fg3qst3,1580500783.0,"Economist here. Raising minimum wage would absolutely cause inflation. But there's two key reasons why that's not a big.

1. Inflation is inevitable in general but also inflation right now is less than optimal. In 2019 inflation was 1.76%, the optimal number is 2.1%. So even if inflation went up a little it would either be no big deal or be a good thing. 

2. Inflation isn't instant. Even if inflation countered 100% of the raise which it wouldn't, there would still be a period of time where you see benefits.

As an economist I am probably one of the most qualified people in the world stating whether or not a raising the minimum wage would be a good thing. I can absolutely say it would be."

To me? Yes. That's nothing. I make very good money and have very little free time. So I eat out almost exclusively. it's simply not worth the saved money to lose the free time by cooking. In a given week I would say we eat out ~16 times because both of us will eat out for lunch and dinner plus often breakfast on the weekends and occasionally on the weekdays. Between me and my wife we probably spend $1,000/wk on food on the low end. More if I include the cost of drinks. So I wouldn't flinch at an extra $336 going from 15% to 20% would be an extra $50 a week which is insignificant. That's the cost of 2-3 cocktails.

Now with child support if you have dual custody you pay $0. So that means the actual cost the state is thinking is double. because if she has full custody he is supposed to pay 50% of the child's expenses. Some more accurately the state is assuming a person making $22.24/hr will need to spend 100% of their income to raise the child to the standard of living it is used to."
