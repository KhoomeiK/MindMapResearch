AmItheAsshole,fgyjl5y,t3_f0pmp1,1581184017.0,"YTA. She didn't ""throw"" anything at your daughter. Get over your insecurities about being a normal or sub-normal income family. There's nothing to be ashamed of, and there's nothing wrong with your daughter accepting a used scarf. It does't need to be looked after like a delicate china doll. It is intended to be used, and when its useful life is up, discarded, the same as if it had come from the .99 cent bin. Laura meant no disrespect.

It's sad that wealthy people often are portrayed as the ones that turn their noses at a child who dates someone of less wealth. Truth is, I've seen far more ""poor"" people go nuts when one of their family members started dating a person with money than vice versa."
StevenAveryIsGuilty,fgyc1ij,t1_fgy9y4o,1581181714.0,"I know you're right. It just saddens me that the victim and her family have to continue to suffer years of this, and it only grows worse. The more they realize the dude is guilty, the more outlandish their behavior becomes."

The truth is, most of those people are probably so mentally ill they are being supported by our taxpayers dollars and basically judgment proof."
StevenAveryIsGuilty,fgybc0y,t1_fgxuh7d,1581181483.0,I was afraid this was the case. Appreciate your thoughts even if they aren't want I wanted to hear.
