... but if we *do* lets talk about what a totally wasted opportunity it was.  I was blown away when I heard it was in a paradise future where we have space ships and ray guns, and Earth is a big happy family.  That's just not possible.

THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT IS OVER at the end of ID4.  Every major population center on the planet has been destroyed.   Billions of people are dead. The infrastructure that society is built on is all completely gone.  Of what survivors there are, half of them die off in the first winter, either freezing to death (no gas or electricity to heat their homes) or starving to death (no one is restocking your local costco).

That's not even mentioning the aliens.  There were dozens (NORAD was tracking 30+ IIRC in the movie?) of city size spacecraft which ancillary material told us were packed with MILLIONS of aliens each.  They're all on the ground now, and OH BOY would they be pissed.  How does scattered and mostly defenseless humanity deal with huge armies of 9 foot tall super-suited Aliens all armed with laser rifles?  They touch briefly on this in the sequel's Africa scenes, describing the human warlords fighting a running ground war with the alien survivors for 10+ years.  THAT'S THE MOVIE I WANT TO SEE!  Make *THAT* movie!

North America maybe, *maybe* has a shot at some kind of post apocalypse society out in the farm belt, and they're probably the best equipped to resist marauding Alien survivors owing to the huge number of guns lying around; but the idea that we rebuild everything even bigger ans better and more advanced than it was before is patently absurd."

Build starts off easy like this:

1+ Levels of Oracle with the [Life Mystery](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle/mysteries/paizo---oracle-mysteries/life), grabbing the Life Link revelation. This allows you to form a 'bond' with an Ally. At the beginning of each round, if that ally is hurt they automatically heal 5HP, and the Oracle loses 5HP. You may only have as many Life Links active as you do Oracle levels.  The main benefit of this is that you don't have to worry about chasing everyone down to heal them. You can just heal yourself.  The Life Mystery also offers Channel Energy for healing either by taking 2 more Oracle levels, or by taking the Extra Revelation feat.

The 2nd part of the build is 2+ Levels of [Paladin](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin). Lay on Hands can be used on yourself as a *Swift action,* instead of the normal other-target-Standard action.  So every round your Life Link(s) will trigger, and if needed you just spend a Swift action to heal yourself, leaving your Standard+Move or Full actions free to do as you please.  Two levels of Paladin also grants you CHA as a bonus on all your saves, which is clutch.

I wouldn't go down the respec mod trail... the temptation to change everyone to min/max stats is too great.  Better to use your smarts to utilize them better rather than make them into something they aren't."
