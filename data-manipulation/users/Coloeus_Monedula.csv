Kinda weird and undemocratic to an outsider but I get that you guys have a tradition of states having some independent power and all. 

It makes sense when you’re deciding on state-level business but when it’s the presidential elections... why give more power to people in rural states on a national issue like that?

On top of that, media outlets targeted to the different party constituents allow them to further bolster the divide. It’s not like this everywhere and it doesn’t have to be this way in the USA either.

There are so many different views on politics in the USA that having only two parties to choose from does not allow for a good representation of the people. Unfortunately, it seems the particular electoral system in use just makes it pretty much impossible for new parties outside the GOP and DNC to gain any foothold.

If there would be more plurality in the political parties in congress and the senate, it would force more compromise and coalitions if no single party could hold a majority as easily. This type of partisan bullshit would also become more difficult to pull off as a result.

Edit: want to add that if there were more than two parties, gerrymandering wouldn’t be possible. Or at least it would be way more difficult."

But in Finland at least the capital gains tax is 30/34% and the income tax is completely progressive, i.e. it grows the more you earn from around 10% up to about 55% max for anyone earning around a million € a year, and even at 80-100k€/year you pay around 45% income tax. In addition are all sorts of other wealth-related taxes, like real estate tax, gift tax, inheritance tax, etc. So there are plenty of ways how the rich get taxed relatively more than poor people to even out the negative effects of income inequality.

On the flipside there are benefits like social security (free money if you're poor/unemployed), free healthcare, free education (up to master's university level) and all sorts of benefits like student benefits (free money, cheaper housing and rent subsidy by the government) all of which, I presume, by American conservative standards probably sound like a socialist nightmare.
