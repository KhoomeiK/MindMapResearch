rarepuppers,ff3d29b,t1_ff3bnn8,1579538709.0,"Yeah every couple of litters there’s a few long coats, the longer hair comes with wider shoulders and hips, bigger paws and heads.

rarepuppers,ff39tsh,t1_ff38hh4,1579537054.0,"Akita in the face for sure but they’re too small to be full blood. long coat akitas are bigger than the short hair variety and the coat makes them look even bigger. This is just a little guy

todayilearned,feomupg,t1_feo855n,1579302377.0,"You should read his manifesto, it’s about a ten minute read and he is incredibly articulate and intelligent. The scary part is how much of it I ended up agreeing with, it’s really good."

AskReddit,fektfhe,t3_epp76w,1579207234.0,To make money. Seriously any weird thing that America does that you don’t see in other countries is to make fucking money. You’re a day late on mowing your grass? Fine. You parked two cars in your driveway instead of one in the garage? Fine.

Conservative,fek9zy8,t1_fek1mwx,1579195699.0,"Elaborate on what “rolling over” means to you? Because you made the argument that Bernie supported Hilary when she was nominated like that’s a bad thing, he was running as a democrat and supported the democrat candidate. It’s almost as if that’s exactly what the Republican Party has done and continues to do which is supporting their own party no matter what their convictions are."
