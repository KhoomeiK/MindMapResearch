ecommerce,ffdj55u,t3_esy2i9,1579821971.0,"I’m building a website now that will basically just be products nobody actually would ever want like Turtle Milking Supplies, Permanently Wet Socks, Uncle Tommy’s Pickled Porkie Pies, and ShartWear, pants that are designed to look like you’ve gambled and lost. It’s a passion project, but I have some of the apparel hooked up through printful.com. 

It probably won’t go anywhere, but it’s fucking hilarious to come home from a job so bad we had a guy have a mental breakdown, get naked, and shit in a trash can before destroying a bathroom and flooding the office. 

I’m selling laughter, not products. If someone buys a ground beef patterned tshirt, cool. It’s probably the best actual idea I’ve ever had, actually. Post after post of fucking awful concepts all with photoshops and stories about the “amazing” “products” that exist in this slightly off brand reality and failed R&D that never made it out of the lab. 

The work of Cris Shapan had me laughing so hard I was sobbing about a year ago, and I decided to just have fun in my own variant of weird products. It’s your standard “find a niche you can excel at with limited competition” strategy. It’ll probably bomb, but I’m having fun all the same."

You can science and teach your way out of it all you want but that does not change the fact that some people will never, ever be convinced they are wrong.
