trees,fdwenkm,t3_en743d,1578757930.0,"If you do this you should follow up next year planting native species. Cannabis is fantastic for soil fertility and aeration but it’s extremely hardy and will quickly out compete native growth. It may not provide the right nutrients and habitat for local animals and insects that support your local ecology. After a bush fire quick growing plants are key to preventing a dust bowl though so it really isn’t a bad plan. If you can find local compost and spread it were you spread the seeds, it will help them grow and re establish the soil micro biome."

The Mouse Trap name could have taken off and I still have yet to see anyone perform another mighty arm bar, I’m just hoping that he can continue his success and I would like a rematch between him and Henry Cejudo, but the mma gods toy with us."
