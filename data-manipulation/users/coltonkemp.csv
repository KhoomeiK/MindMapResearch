dankmemes,ffpqz55,t1_ffotd6t,1580102612.0,Copy that
Kanye,ffpqy3i,t1_ffn4wb4,1580102584.0,"Dude, listen to Colin Leonard. Specifically, the album, “Valleys.” He was the mastering engineer for Bodak Yellow but makes “christian” music. That shit is so well-done without shoving the whole jesus message down your throat. Obviously not saying that being a proud man of the Christian faith is a bad thing, but there’s something about not being the type that forms it into their entire personality"

conspiracy,ffbfxpl,t3_escg9q,1579763552.0,"Dude, I’m going to try and be totally unbiased and polite. This sounds insane. I only say that as a friend who wants to make sure you don’t tell the wrong person what you’re saying on here. Truly, it is a horrific experience but I know, I know. I dove deep into a rabbit hole of my own. I was (am) hearing things that I know are entirely impossible for me to be hearing. I think deep down I believe you. I think I may be somewhat, “under attack,” too, in a way. 

The only thing that I can recommend that actually helped me is going to therapy, and seeking help from open-minded people who are there to help you and medication. (I know that big pharma is a prevalent issue on here, but, like I said, it helped me a lot when I was deep in the hole) 

I know it’s easier said than done, and I feel like it’s hard to hear, but maybe take a break from the conspiracy theories... they are really interesting and important to be aware of, but it can lead to a lot of issues with paranoia and anxiety. I started making music to help cope with some of my own demons. Maybe a light hobby could be a better use of time and energy. 

That being said, I recommend getting ahead of it while you can. Best of luck, friend"
conspiracy,ffbeii7,t1_ff9ix7p,1579761859.0,Imagine one buff guy being attacked by thousands of weak people. I feel like it’s somewhat along those lines
