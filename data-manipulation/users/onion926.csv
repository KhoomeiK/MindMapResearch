PublicFreakout,ffi11q6,t1_ffgx9ma,1579961846.0,Oh nice! That sounds like a great law to have.

The book is waaaaaaaaaaay more graphic and messed up than the movie. The movie is campy and kind of humorous, and it fades out whenever dudeman is gonna do something horrible with the prostitutes. The book goes into enough detail that I started to wonder if some of it wasn’t autobiographical. Also you get a lot more inside dudeman’s head in the book."
weimaraner,ffdu193,t3_erv7pq,1579828913.0,"I would say yes. I don’t approve of ear docking for any breed, but there seems to be some merit to the concern that their tails are susceptible to breaking. They don’t need to be out working to get fractures—all it takes is one particularly enthusiastic whap against a wall or piece of furniture. My brother’s staffie already has already gotten a couple breaks in her tail from having such a violently wiggly butt...

Animals can’t really consent to that or any other procedure, so I think as long as it’s done as mercifully and comfortably as possible it’s an acceptable practice.

Edit: I totally misread your post as a should question. No, we have never had a Weim with an undocked tail. All three had their tails docked by the breeder before we even met them."

TwoXChromosomes,ff0xefu,t3_eqzl7c,1579473237.0,"You know, people who are that judgmental about other people are often just as lacking in compassion for themselves, and are full of shame. They want to be the exception to their moral standards so they don’t have to feel the shame or hold themselves accountable for failing to live up to their beliefs or ideals. And I think somewhere deep down they don’t believe they deserve compassion, which is why they have such a hard time giving it to others."

It’s true about our education system though. It’s been going down the toilet for a while. When I was a kid in high school, my parents one scrap of career advice to me was never to become a teacher because the pay doesn’t justify the workload. I think that’s true for a lot of countries, though, unless you are one of those rare unicorns that never gets compassion fatigue."

AskReddit,fewe27f,t1_ferqbsp,1579409036.0,"Reminds me of the time I actually did find a grave while hiking. Saw what appeared to be a half buried pot with a rock on it maybe a foot away from the path, and was like ooh what’s that let’s open it. Found a complete skull and some of the limbs. Not sure where the ribcage was. I’m probably cursed now though."
