kratom,ffchn8m,t1_ffcc7hb,1579799661.0,"Ive been tapering for a couple months. I'm pretty much stuck at 1.6g twice a day. Like you, I should just stop but I just cant get going in the morning without it. I'm just glad I can skip a third dose at night and still get a good sleep. The RLS finally went away once I got down less than 4 g a day. Now I only take it around 11 am before going into work and a booster at lunch around 4pm. Keep at it."
