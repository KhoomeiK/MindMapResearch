asmr,ffajoez,t3_ese0r1,1579737407.0,"I agree. I enjoy a lot of new stuff but there are certain things that have taken over ""new"" ASMR that I absolutely cannot stand, like how every single young ASMRtist cranks their gain to the highest setting so when they're talking all you can hear is their lip movement sounds. It's so gross and unnecessary. AND ALL THEY DO IS WHISPER. Soft speaking is dead apparently. Even some longer-term content creators have basically switched to doing these things in all of their videos and it's very upsetting. 

I also can't stand how flashy and dependent on green screen ASMR videos are these days. I find myself going back over and over to simple roleplays or trigger videos with the creator's bed or desk in the background. Overproduced green screen stuff has to be really good for me to watch it at all, never mind watching it multiple times. I think a big reason this bothers me so much is kind of like what you're talking about--it's lost all sense of humanity in some cases. I love feeling comfortable with an ASMRtist and watching videos of them chatting as if speaking to a friend. I wish more people would go back to this and be themselves instead of just copying everyone else.

AmItheAsshole,ff6x7ui,t3_ervv4n,1579636748.0,"ESH. Listen this whole thing sounds shitty but it's hard to tell what's really going on here from the info provided. It seems like you're trying to paint yourself as an innocent victim of a child. For example, ""tormented my husband and I simply for trying to find happiness"" seems very one-sided. Also ""Its not even like I was the other woman or anything. Not that it should excuse his behavior in any way."" I'm sorry but he would be justified in some bad behavior and resentment if you were the other woman and partially responsible for the dissolving of his parents marriage. Maybe start by honestly assessing why this kid resents you. I'll bet there's more to it than you ""simply trying to find happiness"" if you dig deep enough.  

Bottom line: you are the parents so the weight of maintaining a healthy relationship with the kid is more on your shoulders than his in my opinion. He has obviously had a hard upbringing, no matter whose fault that is. 

I think from the info you gave, banning him from staying in your home is extreme. You could make it conditional and say that he can live at home for the summer if you all attend family therapy once a week or something like that. You could also establish some house rules. If he breaks them X number of times, he has to find a new place to live within X number of days. At least at that point, the cards are all on the table and the ball is more or less in his court. He could also suggest house rules if he feels that living with you is difficult for whatever reason. Obviously something's gotta give here so try something new because never seeing him again is not a good option."

Make a point to find some people who are GF or DF or both and go out to eat with them somewhere that you know can accommodate you. Speaking of which, find the allergy friendly restaurants in your area. It helps so much to know all the places you can eat safely. Planning ahead is key. If I accidentally end up somewhere with no options for me and I'm starving while my friends eat, I'm going to be pissed. If I have a list of restaurants that I can eat at, chances are I can steer the dining plans in one of those directions and everyone can be happy. 

Re: substitutes--Find some GF pizza with DF cheese and enjoy it! It might not taste exactly the same but it's still good. Vegan GF pastries get tastier all the time. Ben & Jerry's DF ice cream is awesome. There are exponentially more delicious options for your dietary restrictions than even just a few years ago. Go to Whole Foods or any other organic market and splurge on the best GF/DF stuff and try things until you have found your favorite substitutes. Keep those on hand for when you're sad about all the things you can't eat. Again, planning ahead is key. 

I have also found that removing myself from situations where I watch people eating my favorite glutenous foods is helpful.

So learn from my experience and get outside help to work through these things, maybe even with a sex therapist. You and your wife deserve an amazing sex life and you can get there! The first steps are going to be learning how to talk about it and then unpacking the ridiculous amounts of religious guilt you're carrying. I'd say in this process, make a point to stay physically intimate in ways that are not PIV--making out, naked cuddling, some lower pressure sexual acts like using your hands and mouths, etc. Make sure she knows that there is zero pressure to do anything she doesn't feel ready for and if things get weird, pull back to cuddling or some other safe form of affection instead of avoiding intimacy altogether."
