TheGoodPlace,ffpl8wc,t3_euife3,1580097810.0,Yeah I thought the voluntary resetting would be much better. You could maybe pick certain things you wanted to remember like Eleanor and Chidi could chose to remember their relationship but not what’s happened in the good place maybe as an example.
LushCosmetics,ffpl1xn,t3_euifjg,1580097662.0,These look interesting!
succulents,ffpbpu1,t3_euh270,1580091066.0,How does this not crack the pot?
LushCosmetics,ffjboar,t3_etwfjc,1579994921.0,I sprayed big on my boyfriend in the store two weeks ago and his coat still smells slightly of it XD
houseplants,ffj79v5,t3_etwh1w,1579992165.0,If you want an exact ID I’d post it on r/whatsthisbug
Healthyhooha,ffhbx54,t1_ffhbqjw,1579929285.0,Okay that doesn’t sound to terrible!
Healthyhooha,ffh9wj0,t1_ffh9phm,1579927377.0,I’m really nervous about swabs. I’ve had a history of anaemia so bloods don’t bother me and I had a kidney infection a year ago so urine tests are fine by me too but I’ve never had to have any sort of physical exam down there and I’m worried they’ll look down there and go ‘holy crap what’s that ahhh that’s gross’ definitely an unfounded fear but I’m still super worried.
nextfuckinglevel,ffh6c3d,t3_etkxls,1579924331.0,Is this where they have the race in Grease?
StardewValley,ffh4ozh,t3_etl619,1579923038.0,You broke the game man!
TooAfraidToAsk,ffeuqxc,t3_et8trl,1579866410.0,The reason the number of cases are unknown is cause some people get symptoms so mild they don’t realise it’s the virus. I’m pretty sure most people get symptoms like a bad cold at worst the flu. Only immune suppressed people really need to worry but if you want to be extra safe just do as the other people said and wear a masks wash your hands often
whatsthisplant,fezqgql,t3_er0brh,1579460361.0,Maybe bear paw?
succulents,fexqlbr,t3_equj5j,1579434765.0,They look okay to me rotten roots are usually black and mushy
aww,fexm3ie,t3_equue5,1579433214.0,THIS is how you should teach kids to act around animals!

sewing,femc2gv,t1_fely1wa,1579247993.0,Also thank you so much for such a detailed answer!!
sewing,femc1ms,t1_felxmvf,1579247961.0,I drafted it myself from the free tutorial on foundations revealed. I’ve got to rush in to uni for an exam right now but I’ll try to remember to post a picture of the pattern on this thread later!
sewing,fembzjv,t1_felzwvi,1579247888.0,I’m hoping mine will be a bit reducing but I defiantly will try it over a tighter undergarment. Like other comments said the top that it’s over in the picture is not terribly bulky but it’s not thin either
