SuicideWatch,ffecrhz,t1_ffdfv88,1579843328.0,"I also like to pretend I had problems rather than having actual ones. 

The point is that even those who have an admireable life still feel sadness and even depression, cause they aren't used to a lot of problems. This sounds like BS but people killed themselves for far less than you are discribing.

Don't get me wrong, he seems to be lucky but 
he also seems to not realize that.
Don't compare yourself to people like that.Ones you think you are inferior, you'll also behave like that.

Edit: I forgot to mention that depression doesn't care whether you're well off or not."

Some dude I know since middle school never faced consequences his entire life, cause he has kinda rich and influential parents. He's always lazy and cheats on every occasion. He also likes to put other people down and beat them. He also got a considerably nice Job.

BUT

He gets angry and pissed once something even looks bad. It's funny, he has many things other people would crave, yet he isn't happy. Plus he's a coward, who doesn't take responsebility for anything.

He never experienced a great amount of pain or pressure.He never had the will to improove himself, since he thinks, that he's a ,quote , ""great guy"". 

He knows pleasure very well but never experienced happiness."
