See also: Game 3 of the Flyers v. Capitals in the 2016 playoffs, where Flyers fans had received light-up wristbands as part of a tribute to Flyers owner Ed Snider (who had died a week prior).  When the game turned into a 4-1 deficit for the Flyers, Flyers fans proceeded to bombard the ice with their wristbands while chanting ""Fuck the Pens"" (never mind the Washington Capitals are an entirely distinct franchise from the Pittsburgh Penguins), to the point where even Flyers players were pleading with the fans to stop (as an aside: Wayne Simmonds earned my respect that day).  The barrage continued, resulting in a bench penalty that widened the loss to 6-1.
