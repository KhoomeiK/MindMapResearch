And companies that *do* fill a need for humanity don't survive. Almost all companies [die](https://www.inc.com/bill-carmody/why-96-of-businesses-fail-within-10-years.html), especially in the first ten years. Whether or not they fill a need for humanity is not a predictor of economic success, and the extent of their success is not correlated with the value of that need (just what someone is willing to pay for it). It is specious to claim that highly lucrative companies are providing some sort of essential service - a great deal of Purdue Pharma's financial success was due to an artificially-induced addiction to their product well outside of therapeutic levels (to the point that it's caused far more harm than good)."

Assuming that this is true can be very problematic; companies to not exist to provide services to humanity, they exist to produce profit for their owners/investors. That is not automatically connected to a service to humanity."
