I learned a couple years ago that one of my male best friends had also been doing it and as much as it pained me, it brought be relief to know I would have someone to be there for who can be there for me. I think a lot of what helped me feel less alone was hearing music (particularly by men) mentioning s/h like smashing pumpkins, brockhampton, tyler the creator etc. 

Sending you my love dude ðŸ’™"

depression,fdm15lc,t1_fdlzt0o,1578537342.0,"everyoneâ€™s got a way to cope. as for me, I think my right hand is getting a little tired but sheâ€™s always with me ykno? At least my imaginary wife and I donâ€™t fight"
depression,fdlxtyk,t1_fdlw09q,1578535075.0,"i consider myself one of the lucky ones still because at least Iâ€™ve experienced a little bit. one day youâ€™ll get a real kiss (hopefully me too lol) and it will be kind of short and wet and weird but thatâ€™s kissing I guess. Honestly, come to think of it, people in relationships are kind of pretentious, thereâ€™s no way itâ€™s THAT great lmfao"
depression,fdluedc,t1_fdktq76,1578532724.0,"good point. Girls are never actively seeking out bad guys, it just turns out that a lot of guys are shitty once a girl lets them into their life and seeks their validation. Itâ€™s also usually sensitive guys (sadbois) that get the short end of the stick in the dating world because our society expects them to be the provider and show no emotions"
depression,fdlu2hv,t3_elvipt,1578532504.0,"people are gonna tell you to focus on other aspects of your life but that shit is so hard when youâ€™re young and everyone else you know has been in a relationship/hooks up w people. It SUCKS!! You start to feel broken and unlovable because you havenâ€™t yet experienced something that is advertised as a necessity and a rite of passage. How the fuck are you supposed to go on feeling like a reclusive freak?

I feel you on this. Iâ€™m probably one of the most romantic people I know and all my friends tell me anyone who would date me is lucky, but Iâ€™ve still never had a go at it besides going on a few sporadic dates here and there with girls who never really talked to me after. Iâ€™ve also never been kissed besides at parties by my drunk/Coked out friends as a joke. I always fear that one day Iâ€™ll kill myself and die a virgin, never really knowing what itâ€™s like to be liked back. Or that Iâ€™ll continue living on and when I do date someone Iâ€™ll be totally inexperienced 

this shit eats at me everyday but Iâ€™m here with you. I promise that life will look a little brighter once these problems pass. Maybe weâ€™re just beautiful islands that have yet to be discovered by a curious sailor."
depression,fdltghd,t3_em1ggo,1578532092.0,"I canâ€™t fucking stand Instagram anymore. I havenâ€™t made a post in like a year (except on my bands ig page bc marketing and shit) and it feels great. so strange to be in a time where itâ€™s almost necessary to advertise certain aspects of your life because you need to create a brand for yourself through the same mould as everyone else. as a gen zâ€™er, people give me the weirdest look when I told them I finally forfeited instagram"
depression,fdlt0pq,t3_elwuh3,1578531795.0,"I canâ€™t imagine losing my mom. i canâ€™t fathom the pain you are going through right now, but Iâ€™m sending you a hundred hugs. as for discussing your moms life with your dad, take as much time as you feel necessary before telling him, everyone deals with grief differently and hopefully heâ€™ll be able to understand"

depression,fcm1co4,t3_ehstq2,1577761674.0,"thank you for sharing this! i can confidently say doing lsd has helped me rediscover myself and I hope in the future we can use psychedelics as a means of education rather than scaring people. 

Iâ€™m also in Montreal and curious about this program you mentioned. Iâ€™m currently connected with counsellors in uni and it is the most support Iâ€™ve got my whole life other than finally getting meds that help. I wish I had that in high school, maybe I wouldnâ€™t have cracked so bad. 

2019 was one hell of a year but weâ€™re making some sort of progress. itâ€™s still hard to see the light, some nights I feel like Iâ€™ll never make it past 25. But weâ€™re getting there"
trees,fcjaige,t3_egpewt,1577681382.0,"I think itâ€™s alright ! In my personal experience, Wellbutrin is kind of â€˜softâ€™ in the sense that I never felt any strong adverse effects, and weed just kind of calms my body and mind. You should be fine as long as you know what youâ€™re taking, and you may get sleepy from what I heard"

I canâ€™t wait for the fuckin holidays to be over OP, I hope youâ€™re able to find some peace in january"
depression,fchyy5g,t3_eh8oqh,1577655767.0,"a lot of the time first gen/fob parents like to play the â€œdepression doesnâ€™t exist where Iâ€™m fromâ€ card. I guess itâ€™s in the vein of wanting to be the best example for their kids, that and telling millennials or zoomers that theyâ€™re just making up more problems for themselves

reverse racism isnâ€™t real but I think calling depression a white thing is hella stigmatizing and a little racist on the other part"
