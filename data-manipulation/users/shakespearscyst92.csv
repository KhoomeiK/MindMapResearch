AskReddit,ffdtwqu,t1_ffa8kwg,1579828824.0,"It took a long time to actually get over him. About 2 years? Bc we did really love each other. It's been 4 years now since I broke up with him, which is crazy lol

But all of it did trickle into my current relationship. It took a long time for me to be comfortable speaking my mind.  My current bf would sometimes playfully grab my wrists during like a play fight or something and I'd freak out. Or if we got in even a minor fight, I'd have a breakdown bc I'd be preparing for him to start screaming at me and calling me a selfish bitch. I asked him when he thinks I started getting better and he said probably around 2019. So it took around 3 years for me to fully be myself without that fear of consequences in the back of my mind.

 The good thing is that my ex did actually get anger management and therapy. We're on relatively amiable terms now, but I've made it pretty clear that the ship has sailed and will not be coming back to port lol He has apologized quite a bit though. It won't undo the damage but I'm glad he's growing emotionally so he hopefully won't do that to another person."
AskReddit,ffa18ul,t1_ff8x9eh,1579725846.0,"It was like a slow burn. It was a 4 year repationship and the incidents would happen like every 3 or 4 months. It started with grabbing my by the wrist when I tried to walk away and violently pulling me back. Then pushing me hard enough that I'd fall down. Pushed me off a high bed once, that really hurt...

The last time, I broke up with him not long after. We were arguing and I went to walk past him to leave the room. He kept on pushing me further into the room like really hard and screaming at me. It was fucking scary and he looked like a totally different person. Left big bruises on my chest. That was kind of the final straw, mainly bc he said he couldn't remember doing it at all bc he was so angry. So I realized it would only get worse and split. I feel really lucky tbh. Some people don't get out of can't get out :/"

AskReddit,ff8ji0e,t3_es90hr,1579681387.0,"In my experience of being a female, she's probably either fishing for more compliments bc she likes you or her self esteem is low. I'd say saying something like, ""You're really selling yourself short"" might make her happy."
Damnthatsinteresting,ff8jdxu,t3_es8zwf,1579681226.0,That had to have taken so much practice. It's like it's own performance art.
MurderedByWords,ff8j664,t3_es909a,1579680928.0,I do give them props for keeping it peaceful and cleaning up afterwards at least.
AMA,ff87bpq,t1_ff876lq,1579668060.0,She's been posting stuff like this every few days on r/AMA.
AmItheAsshole,ff7erng,t3_es25ky,1579647868.0,YTA. Takes zero effort to just turn on the turn signal. And police can technically pull you over for that. Is it a huge deal not to in that scenario? No. Is it still annoying and inconsiderate to literally everyone around you. YES.
