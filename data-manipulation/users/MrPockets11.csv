AskReddit,ffuk9tm,t3_ev5zdg,1580243734.0,"When my girlfriend died. We dated 6 months, she got the flu really bad, she lost a lot of weight over 2 weeks. WE took her to the ER and they diagnosed her with liver failure. She spent the next 4 months slowly and painfully dying. I visited her every day and spent most nights of that 4 months at the hospital. No one else came to visit her until the last 2 days of her life when her mom, dad, and sister showed up. It was like watching a flower shrivel up and die except she was a person... When we started dating she was 5'2 and 110 lbs, and when she died she weight only 60LBS. Het parents didn't even hold a funeral or a wake or anything... They cremated her and just packed up her apartment and left in a few days. I don't even know where her ashes are now cause no one picks up the phone. 

No one visited her except for me for the vast majority of the time she was dying. Dying is awful, but dying alone is worse. I was leaving work and driving to her when the hospital called and told me she had passed... Apparently it wasn't gentle or easy when she went and she threw up a lot of blood and was in a lot of pain. I pulled into a gas station and just broke down crying.

No one deserves to die alone early in life like that only to have all physical evidence of your existence shoveled up and hidden away... It's like they wanted to forget her."

todayilearned,ffpgchx,t1_ffpfh9j,1580094363.0,"Yes, I'm actually white! You questioning my whiteness literally bolsters my point that I'm not rich or white or American enough to count as white and american! What to I have to do to prove this? Commission a jar of artisinal mayonnaise and own land? Join the children of the corn? Move to Iowa and do the white boy shuffle?

Btw the no rythm white boy shuffle is the traditional dance of Caucasia!

todayilearned,ffpexcn,t1_ffpeapy,1580093349.0,"... You realize Puerto Ricans only get to vote when they're in the continental USA and they don't get to vote in Puerto Rico right? Cause that's like all of my coworkers and the situation they're in since hurricane Maria and leaving Puerto Rico.

Important note: Ole!"
todayilearned,ffpelpa,t1_ffpd1iv,1580093115.0,"I'm half joking. I'm white too and I'm not sure where we'd send us all to other than back to Caucasia... The fact that white Europeans came here and just holocausted all the pre-existing people really bothers me though. I mean, we could just deport all the white people back to Europe and force them to go back to their ancestral homeland but Im sure that would have all of its own problems namely with legal citizenship.

It just bothers me. Like for the same reason that when I get pulled over by a white cops and the first thing they ask is if I speak English. There's just a lot of unethical racial and classist profiling done by government officials here in the USA. I live in a college town and I have a lot of friends that are foreigners that I give rides to and I've found I have more in common with them than other white americans... It's almost like I'm not white or well off  enough to count as white and American to other white american people. Btw pro quality tip: do not answer that question with ""si, yo soy Americano y yo hablo espanol y Ingles"" because the first thing they will do is call for back up and a Spanish speaking translator then they'll ask everyone to get out of the car and they'll ask for ID and then they'll call ICE because you have a bunch of legal immigrant and student/work visa holding south east Asian and middle eastern friends in the car. They'll let you all go eventually but it eats like 3 hours of your time and if it's me then they'll brethalize you like 4 times back to back (it's happened before and I'm speaking from experience, it's kind of funny but it's also not). America has just become a really jingoist country in my lifetime and that hasn't been social progress."
todayilearned,ffpcvp4,t3_eubpz6,1580091885.0,"Weirdest thing in America to me: in most municipal and county elections and some state elections, native Americans can't legally vote... Like wtf? They were here first but they don't count? Their views don't matter to democracy even though they're us citizens? Shits racist and we should just deport all the white people I swear.

AskMen,ffncvlo,t3_eu2ixr,1580064411.0,"So, as a currently 33 year old adult male who was stabbed at 19 years old:

When 2 of your dorm neighbors throw you into an elevator, one holds you down and the other jams a corkscrew into your back... (In hindsight) that EXACT SITUATION AND ALL SITUATIONS LIKE IT are when you should fight. You should fight back hard, you should fight dirty (particularly if you are unarmed and they are armed), and you should keep fighting them off even if they try to run away just to give them something to think about before they do it again... but let them get away with their lives if you can because from there onward it is someone else's role/job to handle them. If they don't run away, then keep fighting because they are indeed trying to kill you... A real man's fight between 2 or more grown adults can go on for 15 minutes or more, you will both be tired, bloody, you will need stitches, will have long term scars, and broken bones, missing teeth, and may be permanently disfigured for life... 

If they run away or are incapacitated or the fight is broken up by witnesses (which did not happen in my case cause we were alone in an elevator with the door closed): Afterwards you should immediately call the cops, take pictures, record the time date and location of the incident and collect and keep as much information and evidence and keep personal copies of all documentation that you can (the police will lose it, the janitor will clean up the blood, the repair man will fix broken lamps, the police will not respond in a timely manner, officials will send out emails regarding this and will later delete them or lose them, the doctor will not get the police involved, and the police may not believe your side of the story... so this is very important). Press charges and make the police do their jobs. 

In the moment of violence against you or another person it is NOT OK TO BE A BYSTANDER and it is ok fight back and be barbaric... Be particularly difficult as you can be... but afterwards it is important that you return to handling the situation in a civilized manner like a man of modern society because without that we as a species are nothing.

whatisthisthing,fdrna2m,t3_emuvdu,1578686864.0,"It looks like a single electric stove burner. It runs on 220v ac current so it's not for the US market (obviously cause the labels are not in English or Spanish). Probably a product for the western European market but not the Asian market cause the controls have European language characters on them (not Greek, Japanese, Chinese, or sanskrit, etc). Single burners like this are used in very small living spaces that usually don't have stoves. We had them in one of my dorms in college cause they didn't have stoves or ovens."

quotes,fd955ek,t1_fd7orc8,1578228593.0,"Yeah, the whole idea of yelling at someone about how ""(they're) just negative!"" doesn't make any sense to me. If someone is just sitting there, why is that the first behavior you'd jump to in response? I just don't get it."
quotes,fd63m3h,t3_ejx1g6,1578185071.0,"As someone who is constantly called negative... This doesn't make any sense... Mostly because people scream in my face all the time about how I'm negative for things like: eating a sandwich, or sitting waiting for the bus, or my all time favorite: showing up to work on time to do my job while whistling... What I've realized long term is the people who call me negative just aren't  understanding what I am doing or aren't making sense. They're just hostile to me. 

This has really wrecked my life too, and it's been really bad. I've been ejected from restaurants, fired from jobs, denied emergency medical attention (which I later found out was a human rights abuse), removed from classes, etc all throughout my life because I was viewed as negative. It's like people just think I'm a bad person for no reason.

I can be just sitting there, smiling, listening to headphones, and someone will come up to me, ask me to remove my headphones and then begin asking me why I'm soo negative (this exact situation has occurred multiple times in my life). At that point they aren't really asking me if I'm negative, they're saying that I am, regardless of whether I am or not. It is not only immoral to punish me for being negative when I am not, it's illogical.

I don't know how to solve this problem, I don't know how to deal with people like this, I don't know what to do with this quote, or how to make sense of any of this... It's been really troubling to deal with."
