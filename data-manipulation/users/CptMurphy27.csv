DeathStranding,ffcrkty,t3_esqkyx,1579805805.0,I was hoping it had a purple roof. I always drove green trucks with purple roofs. Don’t know why just like it.
reddeadredemption,ff9sm4j,t3_esbh38,1579720347.0,I’ve been trying to make Matthew Quigley from “Quigley Down Under” to no avail. That’s my favorite movie of his. Alan Rickman is amazing in it too.

TwoXChromosomes,feem2cy,t3_eoip7f,1579036500.0,If only there were more than 10 people in this world that wanted to treat people politely and with respect just because it’s the right thing to do. I hate feeling bad. So why would I want others to feel bad? Simple as that. I’ve come to the conclusion that the “Golden Rule” was never really a thing. Just an excuse to get kids to be nice. Then they grow up to be assholes anyway. Just be nice and treat people with respect until they show you a reason not to. We ALL have a face that we hide away forever Billy Joel so let’s keep hiding it. Sorry I got high towards then end there...

reddeadredemption2,fecj531,t3_eo7by4,1578975175.0,I just got heckled by a guy in his camp after killing him with explosive. He killed me for shooting a buck outside his camp. I killed him once then attempted to drag the buck carcass to HIS camp. I didn’t see him before I shot and I don’t actually need it. He kept on blasting and then killed my horse. So I set the buck carcass on fire. Of course I use explosive ammo. It’s a one shot kill and easy to craft. Why wouldn’t I?? Rant over.

AskReddit,fdkslw2,t3_elssvy,1578510297.0,"I went to work with my mom as a child. I say child but I was 10 or 11. So yeah a child. She asked me to help her make copies. So after giving me a brief run through of things to copy, I go to town. I get all her copies done. Then I put in a blank piece by accident and what do you know? A new white piece of paper came out. Before thinking I screamed across the office for all to hear “WE DONT NEED TO CUT DOWN TREES!! LOOK I PUT IN A BLANK PAGE AND A BRAND NEW ONE COMES OUT!!” Everyone at her work had to stop what they were doing and laugh at my dumbass self. I’m 35 now and Jan from underwriting still gives she shit when I see her."

RedDeadOnline,fd7dooa,t1_fd798to,1578202865.0,I’ve had luck starting a moonshine mission and it puts me in a solo lobby during and after I complete it. Usually though I do a legendary bounty so I can get some skins saved up. No timer and solo when you do those bounties.

reddeadfashion,fczb53b,t1_fcz1q8u,1578097364.0,I too have a Chavez inspired character. More Native than cowboy though. My posse is even called Young Gunz.
reddeadfashion,fczb0hj,t3_ejiwr8,1578097287.0,This was my inspiration from the moment I heard red dead 2 was coming out. My horses name is even Lou Diamond Phily! Strangely enough as much as he plays a Native he’s actually Filipino. I can’t get enough of Henry Standing Bear or Chavez y Chavez.
