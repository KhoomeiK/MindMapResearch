depression,ffgwpej,t3_ethi14,1579916993.0,"People telling you, you shouldn't cry in front of someone that hurt you, don't let such and such bother you. Come on now, it annoys me especially when they have depression themselves; they should know better."
depression,ffgwhxs,t1_ffguzpu,1579916838.0,"Yeah, I have trust issues with counselors/etc.. Their advice never really helped me."
depression,ffgsh9e,t1_ffgpu6f,1579913908.0,"I don't do it on a regular basis and generally I can just shake it off or I read but I am in the process of moving and my books are I don't know where. I am going through a breakup that has been playing an emotional toll on me. Even before breaking up it has been a heck of a rollercoaster, my family doesn't like him and he doesn't like them and I was always caught in the middle. I guess everything kept pilling on top and I just feel extremely overwhelmed."
depression,ffdd8nm,t1_ffd7klv,1579818431.0,He never gave me a time and I am not asking. He didn't say anything about not bringing my dad. I am just worried he's going to find something else to screw me over on.
depression,ffaurcw,t3_esgot1,1579744957.0,I started when I was a teen right when I began struggling with depression and anxiety. I only did it when I couldn't handle things anymore. I haven't did it in a while but it's definitely a battle everyday. I do use a rubber band occasionally when it gets too bad.
depression,fexanpn,t1_fex7p3d,1579427782.0,"Thank you, we both deserved to be happy. With counseling and family, I hope to overcome this."
depression,fexa74k,t1_fex78kf,1579427566.0,"Thank you, I went back to my parents to live. I am still in the process of moving my stuff out of my ex's place. I am just eager for it all to be over so I can get settled in."
depression,fex6mmf,t1_fex6hd7,1579425426.0,"Yeah and then when you awake up and realize what time it is, it's just like what's the point in getting up."
depression,fex63w0,t3_eqndfm,1579425110.0,"Yup, been having it every morning lately. It's really hard when it hits when you have to go to work."
booksuggestions,f25iuli,t3_dbvpwx,1569975649.0,I live in PA and I go to Second and Charles and sometimes they have some decent books in their free bin. I mostly shop on ebay/Amazon for used books or on Amazon.
