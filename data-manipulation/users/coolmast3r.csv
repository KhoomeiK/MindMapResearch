depression,fgis3q6,t3_eypfa2,1580829674.0,"Okay. So there is a couple of things I want to tell you, things that I've learned shamefully only when I got into my twenties (I'm 24 as well).

First is that (to my knowledge and in my personal experience) there is a night and day difference between making friends when you are a kid or a teenager and making friends when you are in your twenties. When I was a kid, friendships seemed so effortless and natural because for the most part these friendships were very unconditional. I and my other couple of friends would go for walks, visit each other and just would do stuff just because it was fun and we were excited for fun. This kept our friendship healthy and active. But after we all finished school and our ""adult"" life began, suddenly we all found ourselves short on time and energy (or at the very least that's how I felt) - university took a large chunk of our time away and generally we started to feel like we are not kids anymore and certain, more adult-like behavior is now expected of us. This means that now we really needed to prioritize our time in a day + at least my friends all started long lasting relationships which also takes up huge amount of ones time. So at that point we kinda stopped seeing each other. It was kinda weird actually. Like we all suddenly realized that in order to survive and prosper in life we really need to only give time to the things that would help us grow.

And here is the second thing, which naturally follows the my first point - most relatively successful adults due to shortage of time want around them for the most part only those people who can actually provide some value to their life. In other words, they want to be friends with people who can help make this friendship fulfilling, exciting again and a person who doesn't have any goals, and means of supporting this friendship simply doesnt qualify as a worthy potential companion/friend.

Maybe I am wrong though, but this is what I can take away from my 24 years of observation and self reflection."
depression,fen126r,t3_epzjky,1579274588.0,"I believe we as human beings need to have an actual tangible, and what is more important, a MAJOR goal in our lives. If we dont have one we suffer badly because life without a goal is not a life, its just a mere existence IMO. I for one never had such a goal in my life as much as it sucks to admit this. Im almost 25 and Im in a really bad place in this regard. Thats because having a major goal means having a strong drive towards achieving it and having a strong drive means you're in a state of motivation that feels very natural and not forced. What I mean by this is that just like yourself, I tried to keep on the path on constant self improvement myself, but in my case I lacked a goal that would fuel my self improvement struggle so this endeavor ended as soon as I started feeling Im not going anywhere with that.

If you really want to find out what is wrong with you, start asking yourself one question - why? Why do I do this, why do I do that. Cause doing things like eating better, working out, reading books, socializing etc by definition are meaningful to your life as a whole only if they each provide a spark of meaning/purpose for a greater thing that is your life/your life's goal. I think we shouldnt be afraid to set bold and inspiring goals for ourselves. Developing a technology, eradicating a desease, writing beautiful songs that make you and everyone else happy... whatever it may be. As for me, Im pretty sure its unlikely that I'll ever come up with such an goal for myself but nevertheless its so dificult for me to accept that that theres not a single speck of hope left for me. So I keep on going."
depression,fdwcv21,t1_fdul629,1578757447.0,Why is that though? Depression is the same fucking thing as any other desease - meaning that it affects ones health and removes a certain degree of joy out of life. Is it so hard to fathom there are people who are relatively healthy and thus don't suffer from most of such deseases and their negative effects?
depression,f9n93y3,t1_f9n76mk,1575479648.0,"I mean... I do enjoy a number of things (even if they are basic af) like tasty foods, going for walks, running, going to a gym (although it's been years since last time I've been there), good music.

I've never really been a creative type though. The most creative things I've done was building stuff out of legos or other stuff like paper when I was a kid. You know, when you're so deep in this seemingly neverending state of not knowing what to do with your life and all this while having really almost zero energy for anyhting other than meeting basic needs like eating, hygiene and sleep, creative thinking is not really a thing, for me at least.

As to your studies - it's tough to give advice since I don't know your situation, but I guess the most important thing is understanding WHY you are studying. If you can picture yourself at a job related to your degree and doing that job without hating it after graduating then you are perfectly fine. If you can afford a therapy you should absolutely try it, just try to find out how to find a good therapist first before spending your money.

Best of luck to you too, buddy."
