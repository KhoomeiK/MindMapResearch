ArtistLounge,ffzszls,t3_ew1vua,1580392024.0,"the best thing you can do is tell your parents that you won't do free art and give them your rates so that they pass them along to the people that they're offering your service to.

 if they continue to offer free art, then you either tell the people that 'you're sorry that your parents misunderstood/misinformed them but your rates are XYZ ' or if you're not in contact with them, simply refuse to do it until payment is agreed upon. 

I know that might sound hard to do, but in the long run both your parents and client will respect you more for it.

you could also try using some of the classic method of demonstrating what exposure is worth. like give them an present that's actually an empty box and tell them you bought the present with exposure. 

or offer to make dinner for them and give them an empty plate, with the food you bought using exposure. sure there's nothing on it now but maybe someday it'll turn into actual food."

Vader thinks his kid (he didn't know they were twins) is dead.
Palpatine might want to the son of vader either eliminated or trained under the darkside, but I'm not sure he was scouring the galaxy for him. 
And even if he was, it's not like owen and beru were particularly close with anakin. They met once and that was several years ago. I doubt even vader ever really thinks about them.

And even if he did think to look there, all he'd find is a young couple named Skywalker, raising a baby named luke, who for all he knew came from beru. I doubt they have extensive birth records in the middle of nowhere on  tattoine. 

At that point all he could do is either forget it, or kidnap/kill this baby on the off chance hes the son of vader.
