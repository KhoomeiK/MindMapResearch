childfree,fg7qjkt,t1_fg6vkri,1580598953.0,My mom and I ARE related and I still want nothing to do with her. I haven't spoken a word to her or seen her in over a decade and it was probably the best choice I've ever made for myself.

Definitely stick with whatever you're taking longer. It took about 3-4 weeks of Wellbutrin for it to level out for me"
antidepressants,ffw16h9,t1_ffw0s2c,1580280031.0,"Maybe! ADs are tricky, it can take a while to find the right one for you. But I can tell you that I went through a serious injury a little over a year ago because someone else was being reckless and am still dealing with long term effects from it. It's been the worst span of time in my entire life, which had already given me C-PTSD from a young age. Every time I'm reminded of all of the accident or the long term effects from it, I get frustrated and angry all over again, hence turning to antidepressants.

The Wellbutrin has made me more cheerful again, to the point that my partner has commented that I suddenly have good energy. And that was with the 150mg. I think 300 will be even better."
antidepressants,ffw0p5c,t3_evh41y,1580279519.0,"Wellbutrin is working for me. Just bumped up from 150mg to 300 today, so it'll be another few weeks before I can give an accurate review on the higher dose, but I'm noticeably more cheerful and feel more ""normal"" for sure."
antinatalism,ffrzmk6,t3_euuf45,1580169559.0,"I'm the result of people thinking they need to have a baby together, despite both having at least one kid from previous marriages. It's a lot of fun having a 13+ year age gap, 11 year gap if you include my dad's son who I didn't even meet until I was 18! I'm closer in age to my oldest nieces and nephews than my own siblings. 

I have nothing in common with any of them and they often forget that I exist or that we're related, using phrases like ""my mom"" when I do speak with them. Like...she's my mom too, wtf?

I don't even think she was interested in parenting me. She just felt obligated to have me because that's what you do, or something. It's insane. Why am I even here??"
antidepressants,ffrgkpl,t1_ffrfmse,1580157637.0,"I think you'll be okay! I'd say it was a little rocky for the first few weeks while adjusting and then evened out back to normal, though a slightly more peppy and cheerful version of normal.

300mg is supposed to be the therapeutic dose, so I'm going to ask my Dr to bump me up to that in another couple weeks when the current bottle runs out."
antidepressants,ffrfs9q,t3_etcejf,1580157216.0,"I stopped taking mirtazapine a little over a month ago after a rapid two-week taper. Was at 15mg for around 6 months, then 7.5 for a week, 3.75 for a week, then done. 

I haven't experienced any major withdrawal symptoms. I did have a couple weird moments after each dosage drop such as feeling suddenly very cold and shivering, but I was also switching to Bupropion and the shivers didn't last very long. I was back to normal within an hour and have been fine otherwise."
antidepressants,ffrexzd,t3_etrwt0,1580156715.0,"I'm normally the type to eat all day and never gain weight. I've had to cut some foods from my diet thanks to IBS, but my weight has been pretty consistent for the last 20 years. Like you, I'm considered underweight, though I think I just have a really small frame and slender bones. I still have muscle and curves. 

When I started Bupropion, my appetite vanished. I had to remember to eat, and sometimes force myself even though I wasn't hungry at all. I had one night that actually scared me where my calorie intake had only reached around 700ish for the entire day. I ended up pulling a bunch of random foods from the kitchen, laying them out like a buffet on the coffee table, and making myself finish it all while otherwise watching TV/reading. I still only got to 1300ish calories, but it's at least enough to not cause any issues. 

I'm about 6ish weeks into the med now and would say my appetite is back to normal, though maybe a little lighter than it used to be. My weight has still been consistent."
depressionregimens,ffqpt5r,t3_eujmqy,1580140819.0,"Exercise can help for sure. Find a form of exercise that you enjoy, whether it's running, yoga, sports, weight lifting, or ideally some combination so you can move and use your body in all different ways.

Anticonsumption,feiq6q9,t1_feid4gg,1579144463.0,"Some of the stuff I bought in high school was already vintage, or at least older, way back then! I've been a thrift store queen for a solid 20 years now and don't buy new very often unless I'm looking for something specific, like shoes, or undergarments.

My weakness seems to be pants, but mainly because finding thrifted pants that fit just right is like finding a needle in a haystack and altering pants isn't as easy as other clothes. I've been known to buy on eBay though."

He's clearly a toxic person if he gets a rise out of insulting and hurting others, and you don't need this drama or stress in your life. Also take a peek at r/raisedbynarcissists, you'll find others who have similar parents and issues. It could be a good place to vent for the time being since you mentioned being 17."
depression,fef8g4h,t3_eorigf,1579050650.0,"Bullshit, gratefulness has nothing to do with depression. It's entirely possible to appreciate what you have and still be depressed because it's a long term mental illness, it's not something that just happens on a whim that will go away when you thank the sky god for having decent living conditions. 

Does he even consider that maybe telling his child that they're worthless might be contributing towards mental illness??"
AmItheAsshole,feem50y,t3_eoo84b,1579036543.0,"NTA at all, oh my god. 

Back in the day before cell phones were so widespread, my mom had a recording device installed on our landline phone. The moment you took the phone from its cradle, the recording device began. I had no idea until months later, so my mom has recordings of me as a teenager flirting with boyfriends, phone sex, etc. It's so humiliating. You think you're having a private moment with someone you're dating, but nope, mom is recording the call and listening to it when she gets home, saying she's ""going to take a nap"" despite you begging for food because she never taught you how to cook anything beyond pasta. Your private conversations are more important to her than you starving for hours. 

It's a huge violation of privacy and the fact that she's sharing her recordings of you, which I'm sure my mom was also doing with my conversations, absolutely destroys any level of trust that may have existed before this knowledge. I went a couple years without speaking to my mom after finding this out, tried to reconcile, and then went no contact again a few years later. I haven't communicated with her at all in over a decade and it was the best decision for me. It likely is for you as well. 

Are you able to work? Are there any resources in your area to help you financially, such as disability benefits? Is it possible to move in with another relative? Get away from her as soon as you are able and maybe browse around r/raisedbynarcissists while you're at it. I wish you the best."
antidepressants,feek9xs,t1_fedyigw,1579035459.0,How was the switch from 150 to 300? I've been on it for a month and am considering asking to up the dosage. Do you get more energy? Does the insomnia get worse?
birthcontrol,fe5vofj,t1_fe47g6z,1578875982.0,"You probably need a higher dosage too. Maybe ask your doctor about Junel Fe?

It'll be a couple months before I can give an accurate review as I just switched over a couple days ago. I started the new pack when my mid-pack ""period"" had been going on for a week, so I can just plow through the next actual period and reset everything. Wish me luck, haha"
birthcontrol,fe5v9il,t1_fe5qyz4,1578875727.0,"You might be better off than me if it's that thin of a liquid that it sounds like peeing. Mine was excessively mucusy, so it would be like thick strings of blood just hanging there. Probably TMI, but knowledge is power, right?"
depression,fe5ouo6,t3_enrdkx,1578872393.0,"Time to move to Detroit! 

But for real, maybe look into local hiking trails or campgrounds. Surrounding yourself with nature can be very therapeutic, even if you can only do it for a day or two before having to return to regular life."
birthcontrol,fe5okvm,t3_enr015,1578872239.0,"My first periods after having paragard inserted were intense. I had huge blood clots coming out that were the size and consistency of raw eggs. It relaxed after a few months, but then my periods were 10 days long. They were always around 7 days long previously, and even after having it in for 8+ years, my period only dwindled down to 8 days. 

I was never a big fan of tampons and just used pads, but at some point years before all of this, I figured out that cramps were my body's way of telling me the flood gates were opening and I used that signal as a cue to get to a bathroom quickly. Less period products needed when you can just dribble it all into the toilet until the next round, but that also meant I was in the bathroom about once an hour or so."
birthcontrol,fe5jg0d,t1_fe4cyhp,1578870180.0,"I used to have an IUD (paragard) that I got from Planned Parenthood at no cost because I was unemployed at the time and didn't have insurance. They asked for a donation and I think I gave them $20?

Definitely worth looking into, and if you get a hormonal IUD, you'll be set for at least 3 years and your parents would never know it existed."

antinatalism,fdyvunq,t3_end8hj,1578784086.0,"I once got into a debate online about not personally wanting kids because I'm prone to depression, anxiety, have CPTSD, eczema, a bunch of allergies, digestive difficulties, am super sensitive to fucking sunlight, and I don't feel like making someone else deal with all of that, too. I got a bunch of ""that's no reason to not have children!"" in return.

I take steps to control all of my mental health issues because I don't want to live with all of this either, but these people are legit nuts. I think a lot of people are in denial about their own health and assume nothing will go wrong."
birthcontrol,fdwxqd9,t3_en8db7,1578763267.0,"I liked Lo Lo, but my gyno just switched me to Junel Fe because I've had breakthrough bleeding pretty much since I started in October. It's made of the same ingredients, same 24 days of active pills, but just a higher dose, so hopefully it'll be enough to stop the ""two periods"" a month thing. 

But for what it's worth, my more ""official"" periods dwindled away pretty quickly. It was just the 5-8 days of spotting or lightly bleeding halfway through the pack that weren't working for me. 

Give yours a few months to settle in and if you're still spotting when you shouldn't be, you probably need something stronger."
antidepressants,fdpv74d,t1_fdptn9k,1578641832.0,"The first one he prescribed for me was mirtazapine/Remeron and it didn't really do much for me. I had one day of pouncing on my bf and then I became ""flat"" and wasn't interested in anything. I wasn't crying anymore so it worked in that sense, but it mostly just messed up my digestive system and gave me the worst constipation ever. The amount of other pills I was taking to counter it was obscene and barely helped. 

After about 6 months of that, including some emails to my Dr telling him that it wasn't doing anything, but being too scared to go higher and risk upsetting my stomach even more, I finally switched to bupropion/Wellbutrin. It's only been 4 weeks, so still early, but I have more energy and focus than I've had in years and my libido is getting stronger. I don't know how to explain it, but I'm starting to feel like myself again. Just have to remember to eat and try to avoid insomnia, as this one is more of a stimulant. 

Everyone reacts differently so you'll likely have some trial and error. What works for me might be awful for you, etc. But consider what you want out of it (better sleep, energy, weight gain, weight loss, higher libido, and so forth), do some research on the differences between them all, maybe look into the symptoms of serotonin and dopamine deficiencies to see what matches you the most, and go into your appointment informed."
antidepressants,fdp2etb,t3_emh1yf,1578618383.0,"I got my prescription from my regular doctor. I had to answer some questions for him to determine the severity of my depression (even though I was crying in his office, so it was pretty obvious that something was wrong), ensure to him that I wasn't suicidal and didn't own a gun, and I had some blood taken to test my thyroid. I gave him a short list of antidepressants that don't mess with libido, he picked one out for me, sent the info to my pharmacy, and I had it by that same night."
rant,fdov9k1,t1_fdoseno,1578613660.0,"It's so hard to tell people to back off. Feels too confrontational and gives me anxiety, so I just overeat instead. I can pack an impressive amount of food into my stomach during one meal, especially at a buffet, but it generally just overloads my digestion and makes my IBS worse. It's probably a good contributer to why I even have IBS in the first place."
