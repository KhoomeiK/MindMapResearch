AskEngineers,ff90swn,t3_es4nua,1579701960.0,"I interned at one of the launch providers (the one that launches the Atlas and the Delta IV) and my summer roommate was in the exact same predicament. He got an offer at the end of his first internship but then got accepted into grad programs and asked for an internship and they gave it to him. Then at the end of the internship, we had together he got an offer. It's up to you though because I had grad school options too but they will pay for it so I'm just going to let them do that"
industrialengineering,ff0pcu8,t3_eqs94p,1579470995.0,"Yeah IE is arguably broader then ME and EE. An IE can go into banking, healthcare, automotive, aerospace, hospitality (Chik-fil-a corporate hires a ton of IE's), consulting, design, quality, and countless other fields.

I think it’s like a marketing firm or something. He just doesn’t want to Dox himself with such a deplorable fan base such as the RSK

AskEngineers,fdjsal5,t1_fdj7jj2,1578485675.0,The first one was an offer from the company I interned with last summer so they knew for a fact knew that I wouldn’t be able to start until I graduated and the second offer is from a consulting company who is expecting crazy growth over the next year so they are going on a big hiring spree over the next few months and said it was fine I won’t be graduating for another few months. But companies expect current seniors to apply to their entry level positions so it’s not odd for them to give offers while still in school

EngineeringStudents,fcxa98m,t1_fcwgt9f,1578057154.0,The company I interned for past summer sent out an excel spreadsheet with every interns contact information so I just hit up 2 guys we put out housing stipends together and found a place on VRBO which was very affordable (originally $51 a day but since there was 3 of us it came down to $17 a day for 11 weeks). It was right on the beach it was super nice. I’d recommend a website like AirBnB or VRBO because you can put the EXACT days you want to move in and move out and you don’t have to worry about your money getting wasted. That’s just my experience though. Good luck!

college,fcjvv8y,t3_ehgwwj,1577707260.0,"LinkedIn —> click the jobs tab —> search *your major* internships (so for me I searched “industrial engineering internships”) 

And then just start applying. Regardless of the requirements just keep applying. IMO landing your first internship is just a numbers game then you can be a little more picky once you look for your second one. But then again that is coming from someone who had to rely on experience rather than my GPA. 

But if you have any questions feel free to PM me. I’ve had two engineering internships and my most recent one turned into a full time job so I’d be happy to help you anyway I can!"

AskEngineers,fcgg6vn,t3_eh2mqr,1577639643.0,If you go into the job search with that mindset then yes it will in fact be impossible. Your degree doesn’t go void after 6-9 years just start applying around
EngineeringStudents,fbz1yp0,t3_ef3fh1,1577232654.0,"If you want to look at it from a strictly statistical standpoint then do this:

Log in to LinkedIn --> Click the search bar and search for the company you want to work for --> Click the ""People"" tab in the left side of your screen --> View ""Where they studied"" and it will have a ranked order list of where employees from that company studied

I'll do a few companies for you:

**NASA**

1.) 584 - University of Maryland

2.) 447 - University of Central Florida

3.) 327 - The University of Alabama at Huntsville 

**SpaceX**

1.) 138 - University of Southern California

2.) 127 - UCLA

3.) 119 - Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University

**United Launch Alliance**

1.) 119 - Univesity of Colorado Boulder

2.) 88 - Colorado State University

3.) 69 - Colorado School of Mines

&#x200B;

Now, this is not accounting for employees of these companies without Linkedin. This is also only taking into account if they work for the company and not where they work within the company. So, for example, ULA has its headquarters in Denver, CO, therefore, that explains why they hire from so many Colorado schools. The same thing with SpaceX its headquarters is in Southern California, therefore, that explains why USC and UCLA are so high on the list."
