MechanicAdvice,ffgg1sl,t1_ffgcer4,1579905415.0,I can't say for sure if itll be a direct swap. May or may not need key reprogramming if it has transponder keys. I'm not familiar with that model toyota so I can't say for sure.  If it doesn't have transponder keys it may be a direct swap. You have to pull your ecu and match the numbers EXACTLY because a lot of times they differ from model to model of the same car and year. There might be 3 different ecus fkr the same year make model so match it exact.
MechanicAdvice,ffgat9t,t3_etafys,1579902166.0,"First off, if your computer won't connect to scan tools,  fuses are good, and you're having stalling out probs while in drive, its very likely the computer may be having issues. While rare, ive changed out a bunch of ecus and all of them had the tell tale link errors. 

Second, check your engine and trans mounts. The reason it may be hapening while in drive is because the trans has a load on it and will lift the engine and trans and might be flexing the line to where it will leak vacuum if the mounts have too much play. Have someone press the  foot brake while in drive (hand brake on also) and *lightly give it gas. If the mounts are bad, you will see the engine lift or rotate. Observe this ON THE SIDE BY PASS TIRE FENDER so you don't accidentally get ran over."

MechanicAdvice,fdpdb2r,t3_emi4kq,1578625731.0,Maybe upgrade your fuel pump to a higher output and change out the filters.
MechanicAdvice,fdpcmyu,t1_fdosjjz,1578625269.0,"I'm a mechanic by trade and use a cheap molded Performance Tool (~$69) black plastic creeper. Reason I bought is the wheels at at the very ends of the creeper so when you sit up or down on it, it doesn't flip up like old style padded ones. It also holds 350lb guys without flexing and its wide so I figured it would last forever with me being 180lb. I use it almost everyday and so far its my favorite. If it broke or got stolen, I'd buy the exact same one again. Part# W85006 and right now its $36 on summit, wow. I paid about 70 for mine and to me worth every penny."
MechanicAdvice,fdp6rsv,t3_emg4pz,1578621320.0,Just go to any repair shop and ask them for the snap on number. Call the guy and meet up at his next stop. That's what I do.
MechanicAdvice,fdnqunv,t3_em7740,1578591077.0,"Mechanic here, 99-01 civic and accord automatic trans are the worst. Not worth fixing at all. They really fubbed up those years. I forget the trans codes, it was B something, but they all eventually failed. Honda should've had a recall IMO"
MechanicAdvice,fdnpd7i,t3_em7cj8,1578590374.0,"Could be a pulley bearing but might be the waterpump. Another is the harmonic balancer is no good and rattling around on itself. A lot of balancers are 2pc and have a rubber inner padding between both pieces that goes bad. When that gets eaten up, the 2 pieces rattle around on each other and make that same noise. Shine a light on the balancer ( biggest pulley on engine bottom) and see if its wobbling while at idle."
MechanicAdvice,fdnopi1,t3_em5kgb,1578590061.0,"Try replacing the pads for a better version or different brand. Sometimes cheap pads will do this no matter what you do. Get some good quality ceramic pads. Also, it could be your parking brake making noise. Maybe it wasn't adjusted right on the new rotors if it has a separate drum parking setup."
MechanicAdvice,fdnns1j,t1_fdmi8un,1578589612.0,"Technically, you're supposed to cut new rotors too. Its just that nobody does these days and sorta gets away with it. They don't come perfectly flat from the factory."
MechanicAdvice,fdnn2xb,t3_em68x2,1578589220.0,That's the abs engaging actually
MechanicAdvice,fdnl1lt,t1_fdn2f41,1578588027.0,"Does it shake bad when you floor it? Is it even worse when you gas it going uphill? If so, could very well be the pass side axle. For me its an easy repair, not sure for you. Don't go changing it out and throwing parts at it tho, make sure those are your symptoms. If it is, no press is needed. You do need a 32mm axle nut socket, sledge hammer, and impact or breaker bar. Disconnect tie rod and upper balljoint, have someone press the brakes undo axlenut, disconnect lower strut ratining nut and wishbone, pop out axle from hub, then pop out axle from trans with a small prybar or 2 flathead screwdrivers. Remove axle and replace, then put everything back in reverse. Its pretty easy actually. Axle is about $60, labor at a shop should be less than $150 if you go that route"
MechanicAdvice,fdn4miu,t3_em7o6c,1578577140.0,It not hard to tune a carb but you do need to buy a vacuum gauge. You can find how to adjust the af online. Its easy.
MechanicAdvice,fdn3z5w,t3_em5eei,1578576604.0,"Mechanic here, I learned everything on my own and on the job. I remember working circles around techs fresh outta school lol. My advice is, work at a small shop where an oldtimer will take you under their wing and TEACH you. Its how I learned. Younwill not learn anything from working at big quick lube or tire type shop. You can take ASE practice tests online to see where you're lacking as far as technical stuff goes. You will need to pass A1-A9 tests (if I remember correctly) to get the ASE master mechanic certification. They're all kinda common sense, but there are some technical things in each section. Anyone cam take the tests if you went to school or not, you just need to pay a $60 registration fee and $30 per test. One thing that is really stupid as far as ASE goes, they WILL NOT give you your certificate or patches if you do not already work for a listed company in their database which is really dumb because some ppl fresh out of school need a certificate to get hired, how are you supposed to get a job??!? I'm self employed and they never sent my certificates even though I paid and passed the tests."
MechanicAdvice,fdn2by2,t3_em96l9,1578575175.0,"1. Those accords have issues with faulty CV shafts, mainly the passenger side as its 1pc with no intermediate shaft. If you are getting shaking, especially under hard throttle, this is likely the issue.

2. It is not impossible for a cam sensor to read advanced and the car still run. If you are having a code for a cam sensor being fault, change the cam sensors. That's what the OBD codes are there for. I don't know if you have the 3.0 v6 or 2.4 but the 4cyl has 2 of them on the back of the head."
MechanicAdvice,fdmm0w9,t3_elzu2g,1578555067.0,"Pretty sure you have an air pocket and need to burp it better, but you could also have a collapsing hose, or clogged radiator. Its not hard to burp a cooling system, and if you are having trouble doing so, you could have a clogged radiator"
MechanicAdvice,fdlu6cu,t1_fdlsxpc,1578532575.0,I use an impact and just snap the bolts off
MechanicAdvice,fdlqfis,t1_fdlorxb,1578530030.0,"What happens if the grinder ignites a cracked vent hose or fuel line? Or a sawzall/bodysaw blade hits the hoses or harness? I've dealt with many rust belt cars, I'm a f/t mechanic. i was just curious because that's something I'd personally never attempt even on a beater car (for safety reasons). But good you got it done without blowing up lol"
RoastMe,fdlfymo,t3_elvjfl,1578523187.0,If screech and bam made a love child
nextfuckinglevel,fdlfk55,t3_elullm,1578522939.0,Meanwhile in Africa... Women and kids walking 5-10 miles everyday just to fill and carry a jug of drinking water.
MechanicAdvice,fdld30s,t3_elyky7,1578521443.0,Why would you cut a hole in the bed when its literally 2 hoses and about 6 bolts to drop the tank? Now that bed will never be strong enough to step on that spot unless you have a donor patch from the same exact bed thats a few inches bigger all around. Cant weld the cut out piece either with the fuel pump hanger right underneath.. Never understood why guys do that.
MechanicAdvice,fdhtnzd,t3_elbh0i,1578429956.0,"I would try swapping trans computers first. The odds of the same thing happening with 2-3 transmissions is very high. I'd try ordering a used trans pcm off ebay and see if that cures the problem. If not, you have a backup pcm and out less than 100bux"
mildlyinteresting,fdecua3,t3_eks09y,1578336236.0,How stupid. Why don't they just use a pitcher and fill passengers flasks or cups? Smh
MechanicAdvice,fdcjbqa,t1_fdcj2jc,1578276317.0,Should be near CTS on or near thermostat. follow the lower hose and look on the coolant manifold or thermo housing for a 1-wire sensor. They are normally in the same area next to each other
MechanicAdvice,fdcj5gd,t3_ekjjlw,1578276194.0,Very likely the return spring on latch broke or the stop the spring end rests on. The fact that it moves free tells me the spring on latch came off or broke. Ford likes to use plastic on their latches and it wouldn't be the first time I've seen a ford with broken springs or handle latches.
