I would let it go and never allow her kid in again. Unless she and her husband are making good money then sure let them pay. Especially seeing as your family bond doesnt seem bad, so why burn bridges over literally less than a days work? You are in the right,  is it worth it?"

But any investment (a cert) which pays off and generates 100% profit  in half a year is INSANE. I'd sign up at your company today if that was your ROI. Sometimes inside a company you have open job offers but you need XYZ, bigger companies might pay for it but smaller will ask you to pay a % or all of it yourself. Got a buddy whos a security guard he has paid about 40% of his entire salary last year on certs and makes 7% more now and he became inreplaceable. Sometimes thats enough, that security is worth something. In this world you dont make it far if you expect to get free time or free money and diplomas.
