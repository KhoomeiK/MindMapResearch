TLDR: I'm sorry you got downvoted too :("
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffh7e11,t1_ffh4cgc,1579925200.0,"Sorry. It's one of my many bad habits. Others include:

-Not using ""/s"" to punctuate sarcasm

-Actually responding to comments like these, even though I know it'll get dogpiled and kill the thread

-Suggesting people report the post, or just block me"

I have kind of a weird sense of humor."

The last time I tried posting a picture of myself on Reddit somebody was gilded for telling me I look like Gollum crossed with a Walmart greeter.

Edit: a thousand pardons, but it turns out that there is another comment in this thread that desperately needs this reply. So I'm taking it back and re-using it. I hope you understand there's offense meant.
