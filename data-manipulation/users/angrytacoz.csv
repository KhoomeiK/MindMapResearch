YouShouldKnow,fdm2i87,t1_fdly80g,1578538251.0,Well I suppose that is a little worse than trying to explain why you’re standing next to a swing set covered in graffiti with a marker

YouShouldKnow,fdly67u,t1_fdlrb1y,1578535307.0,"Well no, it is just the solvent. Try erasing dried permanent marker ink with dried dry erase ink. 

At the same time, yes the solvent dissolves both because of their similar polarity, but it’s really just because this means the same kind of solvents can be used on both. 

The solvent in both is the same, which is why writing over one with the other and wiping before it’s dried will remove it. You can also just clean it with rubbing alcohol, acetone, or any other similar solvent.

Edit: downvote me all you want, doesn’t make it any less true"
YouShouldKnow,fdlxmje,t1_fdlrf10,1578534937.0,"IPA is the primary solvent, which is why it will erase marker ink after it’s dried. It is a polar compound so it will dissolve most *non*-polar substances"

YouShouldKnow,fdlwv6t,t1_fdloua0,1578534424.0,Because the solvent used in the ink is the same?
YouShouldKnow,fdlwmue,t1_fdlrwxo,1578534267.0,Save yourself a ton of time and just get some rubbing alcohol (or really any alcohol) and a rag. I don’t know what solvent is used in marker ink but alcohol will get any marker off almost anything

WatchandLearn,fc6a2s8,t1_fc65xss,1577475749.0,Maybe not the only reason but there’s so much pressure coming out of the hose it’s hard to hold onto by yourself. We got to use one of the smaller fire hoses when I was in high school and it took two of us to keep it steady. It really blew my mind how much force is coming out of that thing
trees,fc2c62d,t1_fc1yk89,1577351514.0,You’d be surprised how often this happens
