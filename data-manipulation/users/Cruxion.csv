Hardcovers are more expensive, but the durability and the ease of storage make them best. Paperbacks of either kind aren't very durable, but at least TPs have the advantage of not being really small and in my experience have better binding. One read through a MMPB and it's about ready to fall apart. They are cheap though. Ebooks are nice from a cost perspective, being a bit cheaper than TPs, but just don't feel the same. And I've yet to find an ereader with a good battery; my nook lasts about 3 hours with minimum brightness and all the non-ereader features disabled and I've heard similar experiences from my friends with Kindles. Still better than MMPB since they don't fall apart after a few reads and if need be can just be read on my pc if my nook ever breaks so I won't lose them."
