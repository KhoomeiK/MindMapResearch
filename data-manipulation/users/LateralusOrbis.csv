Blizzard,fguxszp,t3_f0f11s,1581131866.0,"Reforged and Classic are same game now. Old War3 is gone. Old [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) is gone. All of its features are gone. Custom maps are exclusive intellectual property of Activision Blizzard if you make one, even if you create the assets or gameplay ideas yourself. Most of the art that was updated was made by an outsourced company. A company that is very good, and did a good job on the art for the most part, except its not quite Blizzard style.

Take a look at the warcraft site. Tons of visual, cinematic, and ui updates were promised that were never made. A huge thing, they promised the campaign would receive cinematic updates. Like this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICMpPrg77g0&feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICMpPrg77g0&feature=emb_title) 

It boils down to this: They promised a massive amount of features, and didn't create them. At all. They asked for pre-orders 14 months ahead of its release. People bought the game based on what was promised and displayed at Blizzcon 2018. And now they've created just an upscaled version of the game, that broke so much more.

If you want a pretty decent analysis of it from both a game and company-wide perspective, I'd check out both of Bellular's channels for gaming and news.

You lose self worth, confidence, people berate you, seeing the general public ignore you will affect you. You are liable to develop some heavy mental issues from this, and it dramatically changes you. More than financially or physically locked out of getting to where you want to be, you are mentally blocked. This is all forgetting what hardship led to the person being homeless.

If they care so little about their legacy and some of their favorite games, especially since this was indeed a money maker because people have been pre-ordering this for a year and a few months, what can we expect in the future.

The past couple years of Blizzard making mistakes I stood by them anyway, because even if I knew a lot of things have changed at the company I still felt like they were keeping their quality of games up to par but now it's just all falling apart.

If this game right here cannot be given the quality it needs, let alone just being functional, there is no hope for any future games at blizzard. Watching Warcraft 3 reforged die this death is symbolic.

Are we doomed to continue this?\].

It's old. It's not as common as people who experience it make it out to be. Occasionally some people get worse luck, but it's not true for most. And when it feels true its usually due to paying all the attention to those games than the ones where it didn't happen. (visible minority)

Don't get me wrong! I think more can be done to AFK players and others. I do think there should be punishments for that more than there are now.

But perhaps instead of feeling doomed, calling GG early, and whining about it. Take it as a challenge to finish the game. That last player is still there. This is still a game where all kinds of things can happen. Losing one player means nothing if the others pick up the slack and are smart about it. If not well yeah you're fucked, but you'd probably be fucked anyway with 5 ppl in that case.

Georgia,fel2m44,t1_fel0zn4,1579212713.0,"Hey I just said they are different. I didn't call out any one area and say it was a shithole. You're the one who just said that. (And it's not I love Savannah).

Edit: and yeah there is a ton of crossover between Georgia and Atlanta on Reddit. And of course there would be because a lot of things apply to both and the majority of the population is in Atlanta. I don't know why this is a problem for you tho."
Georgia,fekvye0,t1_fekpms8,1579208722.0,"Life's very different between Atlanta, metro atl, and rest of GA. I'd at least move to the extreme of wherever you are now.

That being said as I love GA and have lived here all my life, don't blame ya."

Diablo,feiljv5,t3_epa7ag,1579141355.0,"100% agree.

I don't think they are planning to do anything like that again I bet you they will evolve the story telling.

That being said another reason I don't think they will do this is because when Diablo 3 was being developed and especially towards its final stages, World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King had recently came out. Blizzard likes to borrow ideas from their other games. A huge theme of leveling in wrath of the lich King was that arthas would appear all over the place and be a part of the quest or mock you or something and then disappear at the end. It was pretty cool for what it was but it did get old sort of fast, until I became comical.

The timelines of when they were developing the story for the wild expansion and Diablo 3 lines up. So I bet they are already way ahead of us on this one. (And of course wouldn't have changed it in reaper of souls cuz that probably would have just felt weird.)"

instantkarma,feesdw5,t3_eopczy,1579040194.0,The uncle could have planned that better. Barely got any hits in before taken down.
PoliticalDiscussion,fee7zmr,t1_fee7381,1579028281.0,Link? I'll believe if she did. I just read things over the past few days that articles were being written to make them look like they were feuding. Sanders at least explicitly says he doesn't have a problem with her. I assumed same for Warren. I like her but don't follow her as much.
