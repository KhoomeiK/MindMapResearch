About pens for black paper, have you tried the pastel line from Zebra Sarasa? In my opinion, those are the best for writing. The Sakura Gelly Rolls Moonlight collection have great color though. I don't use them as much, because they have a very thick tip. Apparently they have a 06mm version, but I could never find it."
