The players are shortly captured after entering the vault, via ""knockout gas"" or some other subtle means. They are each assigned numbers (random, non-consecutive, with 1 and 2 reserved), like all the other residents. They are treated as if they are a regular resident, and have always lived there. They aren't allowed to leave the vault, but otherwise can go about their business. Some of the residents reveal that they were also captured, but shortly afterwards is ordered over the intercom to report to Number 2 and that's the last they are heard from.. If they try to talk about the outside world, they are brought before Number 2, who warns them against doing so. The players only ever get to meet Number 2, never Number 1. If they ask, they will only ever be told that Number 1 is in charge, and Number 2 takes their orders directly from them. Every time they talk to Number 2, it's a different person. It could be a resident they've talked to before, it could even be a resident that told them they were captured too. Have Number 2 occasionally bring them into his or her office to ""talk,"" where they are told that one of the others brought in with them has already ""made a deal.""

FL_Studio,ff6zwjy,t3_erxmnf,1579638323.0,"This can get complicated so don't be afraid to ask more questions.

Right, so when we say a piece of music is in a certain key, we mean that the notes are mostly the notes of a certain scale. I say mostly because there can be notes outside the scale, which are called accidentals. These accidentals are important, because they make things less predictable and therefore more exciting.

Anyway, start with the C Major - which are simply the notes CDEFGAB. If you notice, some notes on the keyboard are left out - C#, D#, F#, G#, and A#. A scale is all about the notes that are skipped over, and to make things *really easy* every Major scale skips notes in the same places. C Major is C skip D skip E F skip G skip A skip B, so D Major would be D skip E skip F# G skip A skip B skip C#.

There's one wrinkle in this - the minor scales. To keep things simple, I'll just talk about the natural minor. The (natural) minor scale is the same notes as the Major scale, but starting on a different note. Thus, A minor is ABCDEFG and we say that it's relative Major is C, because it's the same notes.

So, to figure out what key your melody is in, you look at the notes and see what scale has the same notes. You most likely will have a few accidentals and it won't fit any scale perfectly. ""Close enough"" works in horseshoes, hand grenades, government work, *and* music. Once you have your (possible) key, you can start adding chords.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment, and always use your ears."
