I think the aspect of journalling that is so enticing is, as you said, knowing yourself. It really does allow you to clarify your understanding of yourself and that's something we could all do with a little more of. 

More power to you, bud - the job sounds like a dream!"

I guess I'm wondering if you're blaming the messenger, but only you can know that. Hope you figure it out, keep writing!"
AskReddit,ffuvh1a,t1_ffukalr,1580250105.0,"I often find that writing highlights aspects of myself I wasnt aware of before. Maybe this is writing giving you an opportunity to recognise and change a quality you've always had.

Picard,ffrrqo4,t3_etjhn6,1580164356.0,"Totally. Am I crazy? I just want to talk to someone who had the same reaction because I do not feel the same way as most people do on this sub.

So many things were cliched, laughable or cringeworthy. The million year old ""don't quit your dayjob"" line, the extremely clunky plot devices and exposition, the reporter being so aggressive and going back on her word and then Picard's couple-friends hold hands when they see her do it? What? Were they in on it? It's so weird.  

What about the time when he woke up on his friend's fucking sofa after getting blasted in the face so hard he flew out of frame? Literally a minute before he's huffing and puffing after two flights of stairs and, fair - because he is old and that's a great way to show it - but then in the same scene they ragdoll picard at 100 feet/s and have him wake up on his friend's couch? Did he not need to go to the hospital? How is he even alive? The fucking shortcut the writers took there is insane, reminds me of the infamous Indie in the fridge scene.

It feels like the show is trying to be two different things; a character story about an old space admiral returning to form after a lengthy period of reclusion, and an action story about kickass robot twins with fake memories. I don't think they found a good gel in this first episode.

And the writing in the last scene! Am I missing something? Are they supposed to be so retarded? It was so embarassing. 

""Hi, I'm Narek u have a beautiful name I love ur work, got lots of questions"" 

""Oh cool you gonna ask them?"" 

""Yeah, uh, that's a nice necklace"" 

""It's a twin necklace"" 

""Yeah I loved my sister too but she died - sorry im so sad u must h8 me :("" 

""just the opposite, whassup in those pants yummy boy""

Go back and watch that scene - it was porno-level quality dialogue and timing, she fingers the necklace and pauses so long he looks at it like she dropped a towel.  Aren't they supposed to be at work? What the fuck is happening? This is incredibly unprofessional behaviour from him and frankly a bizarre reaction from her. 

The acting and writing, hell even the set design were all incredibly bad at points. There were good parts, for sure, and I so wanted to like it but I spent the last 10 minutes with my mouth open at the cringe-quality writing and direction of this episode.

I'm still going to watch it all of course, and I hope this is just a rehash of the origin story for 'growing the beard' but I feel like some of these decisions are indicative of a style that doesn't bode well."

That show is very important to me and is a strong link to my childhood, being able to be INSIDE the Enterprise NCC 1701-D, seeing the Observation Lounge from the exterior view, where so many scenes took place... fuck. It was amazing. 

I couldn't stop thinking that 12-year old me would be so psyched to see that, and it filled me up with joy to the point that my eyes leaked, the immersion factor of VR is powerful."

Hadn't heard about that, thanks. 

Otherwise, I can understand the reasoning, but it seems short-sighted and an excessively rigid stance to take. Facebook doesn't have the same functionality as twitch so the products aren't competing with each other from a user point-of-view. I can only stream to friends on Facebook, for one, twitch lets me attract a worldwide audience. Not to mention monetisation...

I just would have thought that integrating twitch would have been a better move long-term to grow the user base of the Quest and by proxy, Facebook. Limiting people's options won't help them pick your service if your service can't do what users want."
OculusQuest,ffpi35c,t3_eugz3f,1580095578.0,"I was looking into this before. I don't want to judge too harshly but this seems on the surface like a crazy oversight by Oculus, more streamers = more exposure = more sales. This should be core functionality - streaming to facebook is useless."

It absolutely doesn't, dude, and I find that a very ironic accusation when everything you've accused me of you did first.

You're the one who came at me for my definition of art and my own subjective interpretation of a photo. I defended my opinion, if that qualifies as all these exaggerated terms you're using then fine, whatever works for you. 

I think if you're going to criticise someone's interpretation of what art is then you should at least do them the courtesy of explaining your own. Otherwise, why did you bother responding except to be ""mean-spirited"" and write a comment that boils down to ""you're stupid"", you must see the parallel?

I will have a great day, and I hope you do too."
