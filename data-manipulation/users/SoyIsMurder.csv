Imagine the amount of centralized power you would need to implement US socialism (where capital and private businesses are turned over to workers). Seizing 700,000 businesses and shutting down the stock market would require a well-equipped, loyal army + police force with centralized command and control.

The transition will always be painful and probably violent. There were periods of relative calm/productivity in the Soviet Union and China, but there has *never* been a case where the revolutionary council did not devolve into a permanent totalitarian communist party. Marx thought the state would ""fade away"", but it never has.

Those who blame interference from the outside world for the problems faced by communist countries are not entirely wrong, but what country in a globalized world could suddenly collectivize billions or trillions of dollars in foreign funds without incurring the wrath of other nations?

Just like many physics equations are only elegantly solved in a friction-less vacuum, Marxism relies upon ideal conditions that have never, and will never exist as long as humans are imperfect animals evolved for life in small tribes."
todayilearned,fezlbju,t1_feygv7g,1579458563.0,"[Capitalism isn't the problem](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/02/14/millennial-socialism). Cronyism is. Special interests have used lobbyists to push their own agenda, which usually runs counter to the public interest.

Reform is desperately needed (term limits, campaign finance, tax reform, etc.), but abolishing capitalism would be like fixing a watch with a hammer.

Imagine what it would take to abolish capitalism in the United States. In order to turn the means of production over to the workers, you would have to (among other things):

**1. Seize all private businesses.**
There are around 20 million businesses in the US. If you allowed businesses with fewer than 10 employees to continue to operate as union shops, you would still be faced with the forced collectivization of over 700,000 medium to large-sized businesses.

**2. Shut down the stock market**
Around 30 trillion dollars in capital is tied up in stocks listed on US exchanges. A large chunk of this money represents foreign capital. I can't even venture a guess at how much upheaval this would cause. There would certainly be a worldwide depression, widespread insurrection, and possibly open warfare.

**3. Redistribute privately held wealth.**
Under a socialist regime, you can still own personal property like houses, cars, clothing, electronics, etc. (within reason). Under communism, everything is shared. ""Excessive"" capital (not sure where the cutoff would be), would be seized for the public good, under either model.

There are 5-10 million wealthy people in the US (depending on your definition), that is more than in all the armed forces combined. Presumably, others would resist such a transition for ideological reasons.

This resistance would necessitate a well-organized central authority (a revolutionary council, or similar) in order to impose the new order on society using violence or the threat of violence. Marx imagined that this central authority would ""fade away"" once the transition was complete. In reality, no communist party has *ever* ceded control after the initial transition following a revolution.

The Chinese communist party eventually reintroduced capitalism (after millions had been starved/murdered) in order to save their own skins, but they continue to limit free speech and disregard basic human rights, especially for religious or ethnic minorities.

To paraphrase Winston Churchill: Capitalism is the worst economic system, except for all the others that have been tried from time to time.
