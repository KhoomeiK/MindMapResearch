aww,fgfehw1,t1_fgfdtjv,1580736341.0,Newspeak is taking over. Enjoy your downvotes.
aww,fgfeaan,t1_fgf8r8z,1580736149.0,If something is happening that you're not a fan of there's always the solution of... MORE LEGISLATION! The govt is so smart that they'll fix everything.

WA_guns,fgc16af,t3_ex437y,1580668058.0,"I had a question kind of along these lines, but I guess it would actually play in as the next step. So if we have elected officials that are violating our Constitutional Rights by passing unconstitutional laws, then we take it to the courts to get our Constitutional Rights unviolated but the courts are filled with activist judges who uphold the unconstitutional laws; what recourse to the citizens have? Is there any other way to go about getting our Constitutional Rights reinstated once the current system is so filled with corrupt politicians and judges that they deem violating our rights as not a problem?"
WA_guns,fgbovi3,t3_ex4jj1,1580664495.0,It's super disappointing hearing that Sportsman's is pulling this crap. I am about to buy a Beretta APX from them because they're the cheapest price around. I guess I'll be on here crying myself in a month.

trashy,ffzss5a,t1_ffzn67u,1580391854.0,"Down side to that though. I don't know of other areas but if a sub-18 child hits the parent in any way it's considered assault here in Kent, Wa. So if the parent calls the police the child is instantly arrested and sent to juvenile. This is what my Police officer brother told me anyways. I don't know the RCW to actually read the law. Also the parent is fine to use ""Transient pain"" to punish the child as long as it's open handed slaps anywhere from the neck down. So unless you want to start your life in the system with a misdemeanor assault then it's best to keep your hands to yourself as a kid. Shit just isn't right in a child abuse situation. SMH"
