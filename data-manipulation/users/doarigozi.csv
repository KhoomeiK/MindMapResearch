socialanxiety,ff2ui74,t1_ff2u1br,1579524672.0,Am I looking around enough? Maybe it's too much? Not looking around would be weird though. Should I just look down? No no be confident. Are my shoulders back enough? Are my feet hitting the ground correctly? Am I walking too loud? Dont want to be annoying or draw attention but if I'm too quiet that might be suspicious or weird. What about my knees? How much do these other people bend and lift them? Okay okay I'll just try to do that...
