dogs,ffgt2tp,t3_etieqs,1579914350.0,"I am not a vet and can't give any medical advice, but I would definitely second the suggestion to call an ER vet at this point. A dozen times is a lot to throw up. 

Has your dog had a bowel movement in the last 24 hours? If so, was it solid or diarrhea/watery?  Based on personal experience with my dogs, one possibility could be a bowel obstruction.  He may have eaten something he shouldn't have (not uncommon, unfortunately). The smaller the breed, typically the greater the chance of an obstruction, but even big dogs can experience it. The only way you'll know for sure is to get him to a vet and get some x-rays though. 

I absolutely don't want to be alarmist, but I would definitely not let it go much longer - between dehydration from all that vomiting and possible obstruction, things could become serious if allowed to escalate. :/ 

Good luck and let us know how he's doing!"
puppy101,ffdlqyd,t3_esnn9n,1579823567.0,"In addition to the great comments so far, I would also add that you may need to consider the breed characteristics at play here. If you have an idea of what breed(s) your pup has descended from, that *could* be an additional factor as well. 

For instance, if you've got a beautiful whippet or a pup who has some other mix of sighthound lineage, they might appear a bit more aloof, especially for periods of their adolescence. Even these breeds though, as many whippet owners will tell you, often end up becoming cuddle-junkies in time. And no breed tendencies are absolutes, you'll find frequent exceptions across the board so don't worry about it too much.

My current dog (Yorkshire Terrier) went through a definite period of adolescent stand-offishness, which is (in my experience) unusual for Yorkies. Fast-forward a year and I could barely sit down without the little velcro patch wandering onto my lap. 

I would give it time and don't force it - you don't want your desire for cuddle time to leave a negative imprint on your pup while they are figuring out how to adult. :) My bet is she will come around."
puppy101,ffdjmdz,t3_esuwi3,1579822266.0,"This is totally normal to worry about, especially when you have a smaller breed that can appear (though often is not) more fragile. As you already mentioned, the biggest concern would be if they separate the smaller and larger breeds. 

If you've ever observed a litter of pups playing, especially as they get past the 8-week mark, you very soon realize just how rough-and-tumble the puppy play can get. Between wrestling, nipping, and bowling one-another over, puppies get exposed to all kinds of physical play during the Canine Socialization developmental stage. This tough play is actually really good for them and while you'll hear the occasional yelp when a littermate goes too far, they are rarely in any real danger of serious injury (plus mom usually steps in with a firm growl or nip to put a stop to bad behavior). 

All of that being said, things can be a bit different when you have puppies together who are significantly different sizes. I remember my Yorkie meeting a Golden Retriever puppy at the dog park once. The golden was just trying to play, but because she was SO much bigger than my Yorkie, and because she wasn't picking up on the ""You're ginormous and I don't want to play' cues that my Yorkie was giving, it was one of the rare times I intervened and actually picked my pup up. Mostly for fear that the golden, at easily five times the body weight, was going to body slam my Yorkie. :) 

As long as the pups are roughly similar ages and sizes, I wouldn't be too worried, even if play gets a bit physical...pups usually work things out. If you find one pup is being angry-aggressive during play, or if the other pups are much larger, you might want to find a class that groups by size a bit better."
puppy101,ffdgnfc,t1_ffbx7wf,1579820463.0,"Or when you're like ""He's doing so well on his walk today, hasn't pulled on the leash at all and...NO...*NO!*...*STOP EATING THE GRASS RAISINS*."""
puppy101,ffdfyql,t1_ffcivc7,1579820065.0,"Our Yorkie had the same problem. We tried repeatedly to get him accustomed to the bell as a puppy but he was absolutely traumatized and was able to adjust to the noise. We eventually gave up on this one because he got very good at giving a very specific, distinctive 'yip' at the back door when he wants out, so it really hasn't been a problem.   


They are all different when it comes to noises. We had a schnauzer who was unfazed by anything and could strut through an active warzone and hardly notice. Dogs are funny."
dogs,ff1bgve,t3_eqpoak,1579477155.0,"Just go with it and hide some rolls and jam in there too, maybe? :)"
puppy101,fdrxos6,t3_emuw3g,1578691312.0,"Just keep in mind that your dog's sense of smell is their primary input for information about the world around them. Everything from social interactions, risk avoidance, and even [marking time](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/dogs-tell-time-with-their-noses-expert-says/) is done with the schnauz. So allowing them lots of time to 'explore' with the nose is super important, and getting them to walk looking straight ahead will be a challenge. Some dogs are more adept than others at this, but it sounds like you're on the right track with positive reinforcement and treats...they have to learn that giving YOU their attention is more interesting than whatever disgusting thing it is they are about to snarf down :)"
dogs,fdotas0,t1_fdng8g4,1578612390.0,That's so hard - I'm so sorry. She was beautiful. No doubt somewhere a lucky soul has a new friend to spoil.
dogs,fdorihi,t3_emfbru,1578611269.0,"The breed can definitely be a factor here. In my experience, Labs tend to be the most pungent.I've had a Yorkshire Terrier, Toy Poodle, and Miniature Schnauzer and none of them have had a strong odor at all, especially when bathed and brushed regularly.

Look into a good natural shampoo that users ingredients like Rosemary, Lavender, Lemongrass and other natural oils which are natural deodorizers and also fight bacteria:  some examples [here](https://thedogtale.com/best-shampoo-for-yorkies/).

Also, pay attention to their diet. Add regular probiotics to your dog's diet - you can get capsules or some people even add a small amount of yogurt with live cultures to their dog's food. Be careful with that though...some dogs digest dairy better than others, and too much is definitely bad if it's high in fat. Try to give them high quality, simple ingredient dog food as well. Poor quality food that is packed with filler can do bad things to their digestion/health, and that can sometimes manifest in unhealthy skin and odd odors.

dogs,fcxmsre,t3_ejgf0a,1578066684.0,"We've done this as well. Just mix it well or your dog might become an expert at rooting out just the wet food and leaving the dry.  :) 

Just keep an eye on how long the wet/dry mixture sits out at room temperature. Wet food does go bad a lot faster, and you don't want your doggo eating anything with bacteria growing in it. The wet food packaging should have some guidelines, but usually they recommend no more than a couple of hours at room temp. 

For a lot of dogs (read: Labs) that's not a problem since they inhale their food, but my little dog is a food snob and takes forever to eat."
dogs,fcxlvc2,t3_ejdvsq,1578066070.0,"In addition to the other great comments so far, I would just add that any base routine you can instill will be helpful. Try to establish regular times for feeding, walks and even playing/cuddling each day as much as possible. The sooner your new pup feels safe and familiar, the sooner he will exit that early ""I'm in a scary new place"" phase. 

And I agree with the other comments - give it time. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a new dog come home and act shy/anti-social/anxious...only to morph into a completely different and more social dog a few weeks in."
