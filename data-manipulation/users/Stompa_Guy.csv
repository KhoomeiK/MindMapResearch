They need a bigger house since Tad's condo is really for one person, find a fixer-upper to rent from Kermit the frog and to help pay the rent they advertise for a roommate and Jigen, freshly retired after one last heist, moves in and becomes like an uncle to Yotsuba.

What's bothersome is when I came here I thought it was a place to get loaded and just type whatever, look after each other and have no judgment whatsoever.  It saddens me a bit to find it's yet another place on the net where speech is monitored.  Seems like you can't go anywhere online anymore and have just talk without someone getting in the way.  Yeah, places need mods to delete and report advertising spam, kiddy porn or live videos of murders in progress but that's about it.  Otherwise, especially here, I'd like to just like to see anything go.  If I'm in a bar talking to someone else there's not some dude behind me monitoring what I say and keeping people from hearing it.  For fuck's sake it's just words.  Words.  Isn't this supposed to be the only place you can come when you're hammered and type anything?  (As I am doing now, I have no dog in this fight and I don't give two fucks about the guy we're talking about, never even got to see his posts.  I'm just sick of everything being so goddamned censored and sterile online.  I'm old enough to remember when the internet was the last bastion of free speech and now you can't fart or cough without someone slapping your hand with a ruler and taking down what you posted.  None of my stuff gets deleted, I'm decent and follow the golden rule but fuck do I get sick of seeing it happen to others.)  No hate for the mods here, more of a vent about the state of the internet, they've never wronged me and the couple I have interacted with have been very kind, one even reminds me of the same sort of creature I am.

And for the hell of it, proof of my claims, not that it matters but I try to help people around here, and have.  While I have no sense of ego it is important for you drunks to know you can trust me.
