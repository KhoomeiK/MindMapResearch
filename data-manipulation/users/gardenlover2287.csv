They got married because she got pregnant. Anyways he works 2 jobs, while she doesn’t work, drive or even help cook him or my nephew meal. She waits for him to take her out after a long day. It’s really upsetting watching people get treated like this. It’s ridiculous and unfair! I love my brother and my poor nephew so I try to stay out of their business but I know he’s drained and miserable. I just hope that people in this sort of situation would care more about their own well being and stop getting abused. Make some sort of compromises for the better or separate. I feel like at the end it’s only hurting everyone. One thing is for sure she doesn’t care enough to help you."
