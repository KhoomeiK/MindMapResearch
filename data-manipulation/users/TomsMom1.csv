PeanutWhiskers,fe07s50,t1_fe04kw5,1578805342.0,"I didn't see the deleted comment and don't care to discuss ""bigpharma"",but feel compelled to state...Truly and with all due respect, doctors at our vet group would beg to differ. It is absolutely proven to be toxic to cats especially, in some cases, and people should be aware a potential risk exists. It is, after all, poison.
 No lack of proper care here."
ADHD,fe01rv6,t3_enfjxp,1578800930.0,That is fantastic. I'm so happy for you and appreciate the inspiration.
PeanutWhiskers,fe013cq,t1_fdyo42f,1578800489.0,"Ty so much for asking. My Mags is the sweetest tuxedo rescue (age approx 11-13 yrs.) in the universe. 

So, his illness....I'd used a particular vet brand of liquid flea treatment on him before. But, after I applied it about about a year ago (due to adopting a new kitty-guy, who brought guests ;), Mags just began slowly losing weight, acting different, so on, over the course of a year. I took him to our vet, for exams and tests...eventyally, there was a slight elevation detected in his kidney numbers. A few days after that test, he began to crash and was in very bad shape. He was prescribed sub-q fluid treatments and kidney-care type food. I suspected I had an idea of how it started. So, I began researching, and found it was likely damage due to the toxicity of the flea treatments.  

  Well, over the last two months he's gone from being literally skin and bones, on sub-q treatments, and sleeping most of the time, to nearly back to his 'ol wonderful self. I'm so very thankful. 

Honestly, in retrospect, I believe he had a reaction the previous application, e.g. brief lethargy and general change in social behavior. Over the years, I have occasionally felt it necessary to apply flea treatment to our pets. I will NEVER apply it to Mags again. I essentially poisoned him and really thought we were going to lose him. Most cats and dogs, obviously, don't have the same reaction. But, it happens more than I let myself consider and have decided not to use those products on our pets anymore. 

I've learned quite a bit about kidney failure in cats, over the last few months and, while he's likely not cured, I hope to keep our guy healthy and happy for as long as possible. :)"
