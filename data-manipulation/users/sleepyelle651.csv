However I shower every other day at least, unless severely hungover or sick and in those cases my boyfriend knows there is no chance of being intimate! Furthermore I clean myself everyday ,hungover or not! There are areas that need maintained! Also, she doesn't change her knickers every day? Mate, that is foul. Her bra I get, every couple of days but her fucking knickers?! No no no! That is dire!"

relationship_advice,fekn57a,t3_epgw6w,1579203516.0,"This shit, that guy is a cunt. Beauty isn't everything, but you still want your partner to think that you are the most divine creature on earth. Fuck, if I asked mine ""who is better looking, angelina jolie or me?"" he'd say me, even though that is obviously bull. The reason why is either because he loves me so much that those love blind goggles have seriously short sighted him or he thinks to himself ""Angelina, but I love my girl and want her to feel beautiful always"". Your partner didn't need to say that but you also need to stop making comments about his exes appearance, or anyone else's. It's not nice and you also shouldn't judge yourself based on others. Dump him yesterday."

Kinda misogynistic. Also you aren't compatible, you don't view body count as important (nor do I, I don't think it is anyone else's business) but he clearly does put importance on it."
relationship_advice,fdgxlue,t3_ela8iy,1578410822.0,"I have ADHD, and honestly? This is not an excuse for laziness or lack of responsibility. I was diagnosed at 4 years old and medicated when I was 12. I think it changed my life, now I have systems in place that allow me to be organised and efficient. It didn't prevent me from being successful academically, however it did make it more difficult! I think the hardest thing for me was learning to drive, my god it was so fucking difficult! He straight up needs to go to a therapist and get help with developing coping mechanisms! My parents NEVER let me use ADHD as an excuse and my partner, as lovely as he is, wouldn't tolerate it either if I did fuck all. The only time he cuts me slack is when I have forgotten to take my meds and I am spaced out and just bitchy. I get that it can be difficult, it makes you really forgetful to the point that you want to cry and it can be so difficult to focus but that is why he needs to get help, it's not your job to mother him. I hate ultimatums but, it's about time you gave him one."

She DOES NOT LOVE YOU and you my friend deserve so much better, no matter what size you are. NEVER LET HER BACK INTO HER LIFE AND STOP GIVING HER MONEY. Cut her out, she is toxic and disgusting. Continue with your weight loss (safely) and therapy. Also, if she comes back to your place CALL THE FUCKING POLICE. She is unstable and just fucking evil, she wasn't trying to help you, but break you. Honestly, I would report her anyway. That phone stint might not be punishable but her trying to get in to your apartment is. Please take care of yourself."

relationship_advice,fcanive,t1_fca7qnw,1577572782.0,"Gonna jump on this comment and agree wholeheartedly. Everyone gains weight, it's shit and as someone who exercises her ass off to stay slim, it ain't easy if you don't know how, have gained a lot or in a bad place mentally. Her behaviour is fucking abhorrent. I would NEVER do this if my partner gained weight (to be honest, wouldn't give a fuck unless it noticeably affected his health) because it is abusive, dehumanising and extremely embarrassing, she is showing herself up. She is trying to control you, if she really can't stand it then she should fucking leave, we are entitled to our preference. She is trying to break your confidence and make you easier to control, there are nicer ways of telling someone you aren't happy. Leave her, she isn't trying to make you better!"
relationship_advice,fcalkih,t3_egudjh,1577571639.0,"This is disgusting behavior. I am so sorry for you and your family! My partner had 2 kids before he met me, it was not an issue, they were a bit older and just sweet kids. If my parents behaved in this way, I would be disgusted, I plan to have children, however, I might not. My parents invite him and his children to EVERYTHING, get them gifts at Christmas, ask after them. This isn't normal and I understand why your partner is hurt, don't invite them over again."
relationship_advice,fcak8i8,t3_egsnnf,1577570823.0,"This is horrendous, she is highly manipulative and callous. It is never OK for your SO (or anyone) to hit you. This IS ABUSE. Just because you are a man and she is a woman does NOT diminish this at all. She is abusive and you NEED to leave. Divorce and honestly, report her to the police, in this age, domestic abuse should not still exist. She is not a good person, I know that you love her and it's difficult to leave but there is no excuse for any form of abuse. She will continue and she will get worse. She doesn't want to change or accept her horrendous behaviour (even if she did, could she change?). Please OP stay safe and leave, you are worth so much more than this, you deserve a loving, safe relationship. Hope this helps!"
relationship_advice,fcajhlb,t1_fcabj7g,1577570373.0,"I would be livid. My boyfriend loves food but he pays his way and would never eat half of my food and earlier on in the relationship, ask me if he could try my meal. Now it is different because we have been together for a few years and are always swiping bits of each others food. I would be seriously concerned at the fact you are paying for most of the meals and also that you have already had this convo with him. Seriously, have a VERY stern conversation with him and if he continues, drop him because this is actually a red flag, he views himself as more important than you or he has some serious binging problem."
