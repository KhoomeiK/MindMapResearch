depression,fei0gg5,t1_fehzhrd,1579127603.0,"Well, then I assume your crush is around that age as well. Guy his age most likely doesn't even realize how painful something like that might sound to a girl, for him it might be just a joke. Also, they don't know how to date yet, so don't take it personally if you will ever think that guys are not interested in you.

ForeverAlone,fef5j48,t1_fef1q2i,1579048675.0,"Mate, I have no idea, but she just doesn't sound like a good person. It might not necessarily be looks, maybe she thought you're rich or something. But in any case, I think most guys are not that good looking, but if you think you're below average, try some better clothes and maybe changing hairstyle and then it should make you average (my experience). Also, I recommend you a youtuber Dan Bacon, he gives the most realistic relationship advice, confidence works wonders"

ForeverAlone,feewx0r,t1_fdrb2v2,1579042989.0," I'm not an expert in sex, not sure what size is enough, but if you are looking for real love I think you should just go to more dates before sex. That way she will really like your personality and when it finally comes to sex the size will matter less to her. And as others said foreplay"
ForeverAlone,feewv9v,t3_enevdq,1579042957.0," This story doesn't make sense, there has to be another reason, because it sounds like she really liked your personality. Can you describe your interaction when you met her?"

depression,fdyxuqr,t1_fdy8kkx,1578784679.0,"I did talk to her a few times and sometimes she was nice, but often she was quite negative for no reason. The worst thing is that when you text there can be a lot of misunderstanding because you don't see other person's emotions. Also, she has a boyfriend now which might be the reason why she doesn't need me. I feel sorry for you and I also feel rejected. But I haven't talked to her for a month now and I'm slightly less angry, so maybe eventually time will heal everything and we can be good friends again"

I was helping my best friend so much and was spending a lot of time together, but when I changed jobs she never even asked me once how I'm doing. I feel very offended that I did so much for her but as soon as I moved to another place she forgot about me. I was helping her to fight depression and now I have it myself but she's not someone I feel I can talk to."
