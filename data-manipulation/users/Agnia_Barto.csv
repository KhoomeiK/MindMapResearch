Honestly it often takes few months to understand what you do and what your job actually is, especially at first. Public companies is like a whole different word, for example as a BDE you can still be making $200k+, and it doesn't mean cold calling at all like it does in small companies often."

One thing I'd suggest when you're presenting yourself to a job in a large company is stay focused on one particular direction. I can tell that the fact that you also write your own software can be a red flag for a sales job, so maybe you don't want to mention that in an interview. And vice versa, if you're interviewing for a tech job - don't tell them you know how to sell."

Very thorough, no pressure to jump onto the latest trends, long-term thinking. They measure their own performance by 5 year time periods vs Quarters, that make a hell of a difference. Plus, they don't freak out as much when something local happens in the US, I guess that's the main benefit of a Global company."
sales,ff7xlkk,t1_ff7ppk5,1579660763.0,"I made my page super simple, easy tagline, and changed some of my previous titles to titles I was looking for. Like, at the hardware company my official title was Commercial Sales. Just Commercial Sales, wtf is that, no recruiter will understand, so I changed it to Business Development Executive. Standardize is the best bet I'd say. If you want to go all fancy - go on websites on companies you think you'd like and see what they call their roles, then call yourself that."

I made a point to apply to a number of jobs every freaking day, had some interviews, but didn't have much luck. What worked best for me is stripping my profile down to make it easy to understand for a recruiter who has no idea what sales people do. Wishy washy tagline, no descriptions on the jobs, and simple Job Titles, that I'd alternate between Account Manager and Business Development Executive.

Could be flashbacks to something traumatic that has happened to them, or could be just a weird looking shadow from something else that resembles a hand an a man. If they're ok now, don't worry about it, but could be a good idea to have them talk to someone separately."
