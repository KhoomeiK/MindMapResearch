Stargate,ffe47cy,t3_es2jet,1579836257.0,"Took four years of Spanish in high school then forgot most of it. Worked as a cook at a high end Mexican restaurant and a lot of it came back with new, more practical phrases for conversation. Then I quit and I forgot it all again. The point is, if you don't use it you lose it."

whatisthisthing,fe027rf,t3_enbja2,1578801237.0,"First time finally being able to answer one. It is definitely a watch link remover. I have several, some are just the grooved part but come with a small mallet to tap the link out. Yours would be used by using that push pin to push the pin out to add or remove links. The direction the pin needs to be pushed is usually indicated on the interior of the watch band. The grooves are for positioning and steadying the watch band for work and the holes at intersections are for the pin to land in. Makes me believe yours also might have come with a little metal mallet with a rubber cap on the end. 

Neat devices, especially if you love watches!! :)"

relationship_advice,fdwy9fs,t3_emzipy,1578763458.0,"I was in a similar situation for 4 years, she was so controlling and so crazy but it was like some serious trauma bonding going on. Ended it 2 years ago and never looked back, been bettering myself ever since. Sometimes I feel like I miss her but I have to remind myself that what I'm feeling is just the grip she had on me.

Thank you everyone for your replies to OP, by the way. It's very comforting when a lot of strangers can validate me feeling poorly treated. I always told myself my best friends were just biased and didn't like her."

depression,fdlymlm,t3_elycos,1578535616.0,"It's as if I am writing this, only I never felt like it was worth typing out for anybody. I am 23 and I really want to change, life is so short and I have dreams I want to accomplish. It's so hard though. Every day is hard, taking care of yourself, going to work, feeding myself, everything feels like a chore but I try my best these days. I try to ignore thoughts of my abusive and controlling ex but they creep on me. There is a gym in my town I go to in the dead of night when nobody is there, that helps me but I have to eat more still. OP I know we can do this, I'm just venting I guess but I know I can just be a little better than yesterday and I hope you can achieve some good baby steps too :)"

Skincare_Addiction,fcn0f8l,t3_ei2t24,1577799595.0,I would suggest playing with it during a mini-freakout in the mirror until you're very frustrated and your whole cheek is red with irritation. Then just take an ever blurrier photo and nobody will notice.

I'd say rub one out before bed but since you prefer to abstain from that activity I would start by adjusting your sleep schedule to sleep in longer instead of waking up and sleeping more if that's when you always experience this."
