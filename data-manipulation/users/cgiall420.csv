Unclejokes,ff2deys,t3_er5ev8,1579501638.0,Nice joke but shouldn’t it be a mute girl? Im sure every deaf person knows sign language too but you can actually have a normal conversation with a deaf person since they can read lips. I talked to a deaf guy in college at a party and even though the party was loud he said I could just talk normal and he could read lips but I had to tell him if he should talk louder so I could hear him over the music. He didn’t jerk me off or anything though.

CHICubs,fesuvdp,t1_fep9dqh,1579369224.0,"They came pretty damn close to losing. I honestly still can’t believe they did it. Rewatching the games still gives me anxieties. I cannot imagine how shitty I would feel today if you straighten out that Kipnis foul ball in the 9th, with how things have gone since. But winning did also change my fandom dramatically. I don’t really have that sense of hope and longing anymore. Of course Id love to see another one, but if it doesn’t happen this year or even with this group (meaning in the next few years) , well at least we got that one. In the past I used to get seriously down when a window closed (2004, 2009 especially, also 2015 hurt bad because you really never know when you will get that close again). And I used to dream about winning and how amazing it would be. When I think back on 16 though the feeling is more of relief that we won than any magical super team or whatever. 

All in all, I would say it is fine being a cubs fan, but I wouldn’t leave the team I grew up with because they lost a WS that either team easily could have won."

Showerthoughts,fest4hz,t1_fesi4i8,1579368766.0,I bought it at a store that only takes debit or cash (media markt). I had about 800 cash around the house left over (we had a birthday and invited the hühner fred and he wanted cash) and had cash from gift and I wanted to get rid of most of it because I usualy only keep about 200-300 around the house. and just took out 2000 more from my account at the atm. No big deal honestly.
Showerthoughts,fesbfhz,t1_fes7p9m,1579363494.0,I actually live in Germany and paid 2500 cash for a new TV last month. But am from the US and you are right that in Europe checks are not common. But US is different.

For me, the uncanny valley and the concept that the closer to reality the thing looks and sounds, the weirder it gets, is what kills this technology for me. I get that people want a cheaper way of doing things, but I don't see how this can ever become a truly good option compared to just putting a mic in front of someone and letting them speak in a natural human voice. You can keep getting closer and closer and closer to natural sounding, but I personally don't believe we will get to the point where it doesn't creep people out."

camping,fejreep,t1_fejqs6d,1579183958.0,"yeah, just try it, see what you think. I wouldn't say it tastes like bacon at all--it kinda just tastes like a campfire smells I guess. I like all kinds of beers, and definitely have one every time I go to bamberg (4 times so far), but I don't have more than 1 or 2 and don't bring any home with me. 

If you are staying in the area and want to try a really good beer in a nice small town, try Hofmühl beer in Eichstätt, which is not far from Bamberg. The beer has won the world beer cup a few times, but still the brewery is so small that you can only get the beer in and around that town, which is also worth a visit and stroll. 

In general most beers you will get will be either a helles (light) or a hefeweizen, or some types of dark beer. There are many more subtypes, but every pub will have those 3 and so it makes sense to try them all. I am a hefeweizen (also called weissbier especially in bavaria where you are going). 

Have a nice trip! Hope you love bavaria."
camping,fejprlt,t1_fejmhvl,1579182703.0,"I guess you visited Bamberg and are assuming that it is a thing in the rest of Germany, because that's really the only place where you can get a smoky beer. It's worth a try if you are there, and the city is beautiful and worth a visit, but it is definitely not a ""big thing"" in the rest of Germany."

If we would win another one, I am pretty sure my feelings about the '16 guys would change.

That is worth more to me personally than the difference on paper between him and some prospects or arrenados value vs contract or whatever. I want the team to be good in the future but I don’t give a fuck about nolan arrenado. KB will be gone someday but I don’t want it to be over money or because of some calculations based on prospects.
