I have been on both sides of the issue, an avid cyclist and a car commuter. 

The same people that get butthurt by a cyclist going through a red light are the same that roll through a stop sign because they have places to be."
careerguidance,ffm62n5,t3_eu78ll,1580049196.0,"I would say if you can do the interview without any financial impact, then you should. Worst case is that you get some interview practice. Best case is you get an offer and it wasn’t as bad as you feared. 

If none of that is the case, then just send them a message letting them know that circumstances have changed, and you are no longer interested in the position, thanks for the time.

Edit: upon second read, this sounds like an internal interview.  I think I would go through the process any way, and have the discussion afterwards."

Part of it would depend on the level of detail (no pun intended) your coworker is performing. Is he waxing panel edges and door wells, or just wiping with a damp cloth. 

There will be a tipping point where 100% perfect means loss of profit, and half-assed means customer complaints and lost business. 

Thirdly, maybe after doing the job for a bit longer you will become more efficient and bring those times down."

This is a kindergarten kid, in a kindergarten class, that just wrote “I love you” this year, with his own hands holding a marker and everything.  He only flubbed the end because he wanted to squeeze in an exclamation point. Did I mention kindergarten?

It is sad that so many people are up in arms about a kid that loves their parent because the didn’t see their own kid do it, if they even had a kid. It is better to shit all over a someone else’s post than it is to just move on. 

Congrats OP on having a loving family, regardless of who wrote the note.

She flipped thru her phone and had numerous samples of writing I would wager are more readable than mine. 
She will probably have her whole class do one tomorrow. 


Here is one photo. The only issue here is the ‘u’ got scrunched up a bit because the kid wanted to add an exclamation point. The kid wanted to add punctuation.

You tell them that you have another offer and they could:

1) Do nothing. Their process is their process and there is nothing that can be done to expedite. 

2) They are interested in you and make an effort to speed things up so they don’t lose you. 

3) They aren’t interested, thank you for your time and remove you from consideration. 

Since you are willing to accept the other offer, you don’t have a lot to lose in this situation (IMO)"
careerguidance,feiayqg,t3_ep8dnt,1579134267.0,"If I received a first offer that I would be willing to take, I would postpone the decision as much as reasonable, then notify the second company I had another offer buy I would really close to work for the second company and try to speed up the process. 

Since the larger company is...larger, it is likely to move slowly and this plan may not work. 

You could accept the first offer, and hope to get the other before the starting date. Then, your only risk is burning that bridge to the first company."

I have used it for 2 winters. It is the only blanket I need. It is too warm to use year around though. 

I haven’t taken it apart yet to see the interior contents. 

Only minor grip is I think the pockets could be smaller. It sometimes fells the beads are collecting on edges on not evenly spread. I think this is the main difference between this version and the more expensive ones. 

In all, I like it, glad I bought it. Have no real regrats."
