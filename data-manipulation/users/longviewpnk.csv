2 toilets would be a Men's and a Women's restroom. That's the standard for an office of up to 35 people. We never see that many people working in the Scranton sales office.

psychology,fd52j9d,t1_fd3sx4u,1578173644.0,I've known several people like this. I used to be in mom group on Facebook that started out semi-crunchy. Like at first it was just my IRL friends who liked to use cloth diapers and we would co-op together to get veggies straight from farmers etc. After a while it started having more anti-vaxxers join and there were several people in there who were seriously disturbed diet-wise. At least 4 women who would only eat or feed their kids organic produce and they started getting obsessed to the point of only eating plants from soil that was tested for lead. One lady wouldn't allow her kids to get dental x-rays even though she knew her kids had cavities. Yes you could call it general health obsession and not single out the diet part but anorexia and bulimia also have other obsessions that go along with the weight obsession.

personalfinance,fd11vp2,t3_ejttyc,1578126642.0,"I looked at some figures from schools that listed their dorm costs online and it runs about $8k per year. If you can graduate in 2 years that would be $16k you would have to pay back. If you think you would have a career that would allow you to pay back that amount in 10 years, and it would help you succeed better in school it might be worth it to you. Alternately, you can look for a roommate situation. YMMV! I live in a college town and a two bedroom rents for $600/month. If you can split that then you are looking at $3600 per year. We also have privately owned dorm sort of apartments that rent for $400/month, you share a kitchen with 4 other apartments but you don't have to worry about finding a roommate. Most people would jump for joy if they could get through college with just $7200 in loans."

My husband grew up in the Church of Christ and like you was raised to believe that for some reason God stopped giving spiritual gifts to people. There is nothing in the Bible to support this. Prophets still exist. I'm studying to be a Deacon. When I am through with my training and being discerned for ministry by a large team of clergy and laymen I will work for a Bishop.
