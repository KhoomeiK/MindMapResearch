PublicFreakout,ffd6ngv,t1_ffctzs7,1579814452.0,"You know what sucks? The entire UMass system uses the same company to run their cafeterias. So Amherst gets the country’s best dining and the other campuses get reeeeally shitty food. Whenever we complain we get the same excuses “well Amherst isn’t complaining” and “well we cater Fenway park” (Aramark)


Also yes this incident happened in Amherst"

legaladvice,ff7db3c,t1_ff6jeyt,1579646906.0,"just so you know for the future, when you get a new job you should always take a good look at the first couple paystubs to make sure everything looks right. Stuff like this is rare, but does happen. wage theft is another much more common problem you should look out for, that you would be able to discover by keeping track of your paystubs."

YouShouldKnow,ff3e8gq,t1_ff34rnj,1579539297.0,Nah dude I’ve never seen that. Most of the gas stations where I’m from have a literal TV screen under the gallon/price counter that plays YouTube-style advertising as loud as possible for the most random shit that has nothing to do with driving or buying gas.
YouShouldKnow,ff3e0oe,t1_ff37l06,1579539191.0,They started popping up ~5 years ago and now they’re fucking everywhere. They make them loud as fuck too so you can’t avoid them by sitting in your car.
YouShouldKnow,ff3dsz1,t1_ff39mtn,1579539077.0,Honestly they probably make it so loud because they know people will go sit in their car to avoid it while the gas is pumping

boston,ff1t1x5,t3_er0n25,1579485544.0,If you can afford/are willing to switch between two sets of tires a year then it’s fine. But winter tires are actually worse than all seasons on basically any type of road not covered by snow. If the road is totally dry or wet on a warm day you’ll have a lot less grip and your braking distance will increase.

memes,fe8v869,t1_fe8r5kh,1578931349.0,"That’s right! Massachusetts’ education system ranks on par with Sweden and Norway. We have the highest percentage of people with college degrees too, at 42%. I think it’s because we’ve struck a good balance between state and city/town funding. Most states either leave it completely up to the local districts (which makes great schools in rich towns but shitty schools in poor towns) or control education directly (which imo bogs everything down in bureaucracy.) in MA the rich towns basically pay for it themselves but the poor towns get a lot of help from Boston"
memes,fe8pn6s,t1_fe87fqm,1578928983.0,"School stuff is left up to the states, so you’ll find that some American states are way more educated than the norm, and the others are way less educated then the norm. In my state, I definitely had geography as a separate subject in highschool and we had to memorize the states, Canadian provinces and like 50 countries on the map. But then again, my state would have the world’s best education system if it was its own country. If you asked someone who went to public school in Mississippi or Kentucky, it would probably be a much different story."

PublicFreakout,fe6kcs3,t1_fe6h5z2,1578893749.0,"France doesn’t have states like America does. The national government controls most of this stuff and the governments of the various subdivisions of the country don’t have that much influence. There are two police forces in France, the National Police that patrols in the cities and is a more community-oriented police force and the Gendarmerie, which is a more military-like force that can actually be deployed in war under certain circumstances but in peacetime patrols the rural areas as the main police service there. I’m sure that in a huge protest like this officers from both agencies are there."
