AskReddit,ffappe5,t1_ffa7chc,1579741583.0,This one puts a smile on my face. I used to be a cart pusher and general cleanup for a kmart. I remember the store manager talking some big shit about how much the company was worth. I was only getting about 5 something an hour. Ended up going across the street to tacobell for a 30 cent raise with a lot less shitheads over me.

ImGoingToHellForThis,ff8he3j,t3_es1yt9,1579678582.0,My only take with transgender people is that it only counts if your swapping between male and female. It doesnt take surgery to go from a half dragon non queer whatever to a wolf cub semi relevant non demi mocha latte. So someone who had a bad day could suddenly be trans gender over a bottle of liquor and not even know it the next day. Its all bullshit.

IdiotsInCars,fepel4n,t1_fepdxdm,1579318571.0,Yeah insurance profit pisses me off way more than bad drivers. Realistically im way more likely to go the wrong way myself just to try and get back in front of the guy.
IdiotsInCars,fepa5pz,t1_fep4cpl,1579315583.0,How about this. You missed your turn so keep going straight and not involve me in your poor navigational and decision making skills.

Hopefully this is the last straw in a long line of trying to wedge himself into traffic and he has to shred his license. That ""just let him do it"" bullshit isnt helping anyone.

destiny2,fekihau,t1_fekg8n7,1579200735.0,I dont see how it would be good in pvp since the whole point is the devour thing. Unless you kill multiple in a short period of time. In pve it melts everything i point it at.

Showerthoughts,fek3xji,t1_fek3872,1579192088.0,Right but it seems like whenever an alien from any show or movie exists this subject always comes up. And every time it seems like the thing to do is to assume they cant fuck.
Showerthoughts,fek2zm0,t1_fek2hlm,1579191516.0,Just because its an alien doesnt mean its always asexual. This shit always comes up as if most species do not fuck.
