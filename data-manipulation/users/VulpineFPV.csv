Christianity,fffr5bu,t1_fffmpz0,1579889999.0,"There are multiple accounts and findings where we have had from philosophisers or judges at the time who talked about Jesus and the people who followed him. It's not a question on both sides that if he existed, but whether he truly is who he says he is.

We are finding artifacts all the time, though the question is are they supportive? People didn't think Nazareth existed until we found evidence of it. It's a very different society where few people could write, and not many things were well documented.

I'd suggest to check out the accounts of Romans Pliny and Tacitus or the findings of Pontius Pilate where Jesus is mentioned. I'd point out that both historians and archaeologist will usually say he existed. The real problem you'd have is did he die for you.

I'd leave this up to your journey with the Bible if your willing."

aww,fdx9zfg,t1_fcxg9z6,1578766786.0,"Dogs all treat their senses differently and how they react to stimuli. while I can say it's 90 percent the owners, that stimuli will factor in dogs not always listening or not acting as they have been trained and told. (Squirrels, fireworks, smells too irresistible for the average doggo)

The spray is a dog repellent that should keep them away, just like mosquito repellent, but often times it makes all the dogs bark or go in for a closer look. Since our new mailman has stopped wearing the spray, he hasn't been attacked or jumped by a dog for years and our neighborhood has been quite for mornings on end for that time.

It's more detailing the spray and what it can do. It's not mandatory but it's an option for them to use."

Kerrygold butter and avocado oil.

I threw the shrimp (pink shrimp and not the gray ones)  in the cast iron and heated them up with avocado oil and butter on medium heat and brought to a small simmer. Once it was warming up I powered the top with the seasoning above (leaving the salt until the end). Stir and flip around so it collects the oils and mixes the spices with the greased pan. I added more butter and chilli powder at the end to give it a nice almost curry like taste.

Bacon grease was used to cure the pan before use. It doesn't end up smelling the food and it gives it a super nice layer.

I don't have the ranch recipe though since I wasn't the one who made it. Any ranch to top it off should be nice. The salad bowls are made by my local King Soopers and the salad was a nice iceberg lettuce, red cabbage with some shredded carrots."

You also have TEAR and ARET but they have to match from remote to quad. 

You may also want to check out the board direction (orientation) and what it considers up and forward instead of where your quads camera is facing.
