Essentially - here's my (pretty uneducated) take:

If you read up on water safety and studies, you'll find a LOT of government reports about how it fails x test or y test. But within the same reports, it shares how those tests are kinda meaningless to some degree in regards to health safety. 

It's good transparency. Excellent even, and written for water professionals to decipher. But to a non-professional, it can also look very alarming if you have no idea on how to interpret the data or how it relates to your own water supply in your district.

Even with my roughly 8 hours of research was I unable to decipher many of the tests. 

But -- just like antivaxxers, I can see a careless fearmonger going through the same data and suddenly form ""the drinking water is poison!"" Because of the surface level reports.  

PS: In regards to failed test, the analog I want to share is computers. in your computer/phone, there may be dozens of failures and warnings a second. If it ever showed you, you'll feel overwhelmed as well. But it doesn't. If it was critical, then your computer would crash. But it's not. Not every alert or failure is critical, and many don't affect the day to day operations."

Like, Relearn React with hooks. Stash everything you know about state management away (with classes). Pretend to look at react for the first time. 

For me, hooks solved my 'prop drilldown' spaghetti that I'd end up with because I didn't think it through enough."
Spokane,fffgzjp,t3_esycej,1579883753.0,"There was a article I read (and I'm going to fudge the numbers because I forget) about how like 13 individuals make up 80% of the car thefts in Portland, and the city council are attempting to close that loophole that lets them get out. 

And this is where I wish there was a mechanism, something that is so beyond a repeat offender... That can do something about this."
HumansAreMetal,fffganf,t1_fff9b07,1579883324.0,Oh this isn't real. I was hoping to go in a rabbit hole. Love stories of corporate failures.
Buddhism,ffff5m8,t3_et6bvf,1579882620.0,"This is amazing, thank you!

I've been carrying little reminders in my bookbag and it always helps me take a step back when I need it. I'm excited to print these out and add more to my collection. 

I appreciate you sharing/providing this."
patientgamers,fffelnh,t3_et93em,1579882268.0,"Games that rely on a lot of crazy physics. Like  kerbal space program game or even the half-life Gmod game. 

I spend a few minutes trying to wrap my head around those games, and if it doesn't click in that time, I quit. But the youtube videos are amazing and looks fun if I just had the patience."

FreeCodeCamp,ffecxsm,t3_et4w2u,1579843493.0,"Great job! Looks impressive and proud of the work! 

I personally would call this done and stash it right into your portfolio. 

If you do want to do a little more: 

1. Your favicon is a default. Change that.
2. Possibly add a small footer to include a link to yourself/github/copyright/etc. 

Either way - great stuff and looking forward to your future material!"
ScienceBasedParenting,ffccrcr,t3_eshnkr,1579796647.0,"If you're not ready for a completely virtual school (I worked online for eLearning as a dev, and there's a LOT of challenges on both students and teachers that was my job to solve)... An alternative is to explore the concept of upside down classrooms. 

It's online learning, but then you meet in person for questions, testing, review, etc. Depending on the program, it might be once a day or even once a week. You might find programs like that in your area that don't officially call themselves a virtual school."
NewsOfTheWeird,ffccb1i,t1_ffc6ncs,1579796363.0,"Philadelphia in the early 2000# had a huge tourism ad  pushing people to ""sleep over"", with people walking around town in their pajamas. Many tourists actually did do it. Even jobs downtown started to get on the action and have pajama days. It was actually kind of fun. 

I was in college, poor, and didn't own any pajamas that wasn't a dirty rock band shirt and a cheap pair of sweats, so I was always wearing my PJs by that logic."

FreeCodeCamp,ffcapwz,t1_ffb9s1c,1579795365.0,"Just came to say that. As well as a bunch of YouTube and udemy. 

Pick one as your primary, and use the others as support. Try to go as far deep as you can and STICK WITH IT, because it's very easy to lose focus and continue jumping to a bunch of newbie material over and over again when things get tough. (I say that from personal experience)"
SideProject,ffayej4,t1_ffalo09,1579747370.0,"I work with a lot of small businesses. One of the metrics I use to determine if I should recommend them is how human they are. For example: When I hit their live chat, are they trying to have a real life conversation and treat people like people, or just aiming to send me documentation links and push me on my way? How are they using business language?

The greatest product in the world is only as great as their communication & support. And OrganizeEmail seems to be shoving business language down our throats. Can't recommend it."
howdidtheycodeit,ff8kjw8,t3_es8h0x,1579682907.0,Is this in reference to the kid who kept asking how that fighting game/rpg game was coded in like multiple posts? I did enjoy his persistence.
SideProject,ff8kgvw,t1_ff8ho86,1579682783.0,"What's your end goal?

With any products built off of Google's platform, it's the concern that you either update constantly and expand (like boomerang), get eaten by Google or get copied by them. What's your end goal?"
forbiddensnacks,ff8ja4k,t1_ff796ow,1579681079.0,"Why would it not be?

If you have a specific diet, you tend to also pay attention to your meal preparation. Let a non-vegan cook your food without proper training or explanation? Yeah... Gonna call a huge BS."
reactjs,ff5bcaj,t1_ff5878g,1579586061.0,Same. There's like a certain sweet spot of knowing just enough js in order to move to React. Knowing too much can make it feel like you're spinning your wheels.
SubredditDrama,ff4qj2c,t1_ff4dxus,1579570028.0,"Oh God. 

I swear, there are regulars on there that spend more time bashing the game for the subreddit they are on than actually play. 

And every update has a bunch of 'dont you know fo76 is garbage'? Like... Why are you still here then? Why is your self worth dedicated to being personally attacked by a video game?"
