LiS is something I will never forget for as long as I live because entertainment mediums (including video games) have a profound effect on me. Oh, I forgot to mention that I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder over 20 years ago. It's part of every action I perform. Saying LiS is above all that is bigger than you can know. Fuck, I drink just to get over stuff that hurts like it and I'm even drunk right now, but I can tell you that LiS had a true and undulated effect on me just the same. That's what is so great about it to me. Genuine emotion is rare for me to feel, but LiS is the real deal. I get that very rarely. Don't over do LiS. Enjoy it in small portions.
