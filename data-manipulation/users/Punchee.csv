Indiana,ffjdpth,t1_ffgeeki,1579996112.0,"Same.

I emailed him and told him of my desire for him to vote to remove Trump.

I got this--

>Dear (Punchee),

>Thank you for contacting me regarding President Trump. I appreciate hearing from you.

>On September 9, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee was notified of a whistleblower complaint. The complaint relied on secondhand reports from unnamed sources to allege President Trump had improperly used the office of President to solicit cooperation from the Ukrainian President to investigate allegations of meddling in the 2016 election by Ukrainian officials and corrupt behavior from previous U.S. officials in Ukraine. The House Committee demanded immediate declassification of sensitive documents to investigate the claims. Before either the whistleblower’s report or the transcript of the conversation had been released, Speaker Pelosi announced she supported the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry in the House.

>In the days following the announcement of the inquiry, the President, in the interest of full transparency, took unprecedented action by ordering the declassifying and public release of both the transcript of the phone call between the President and Zelensky and the anonymous whistleblower report.

>Now having read both the whistleblower report and the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, I believe that the impeachment proceedings can only be characterized as a politicized attack on the Trump Administration. The documents reveal a conversation in which President Trump talked to President Zelensky about alleged corruption that occurred in Ukraine beginning under the Obama Administration and continuing through the 2016 election, topical and highly relevant to the United States’ recent relationship with Ukraine.

>Career politicians, distressed by President Trump’s election in 2016, have sought from the day after the election to undermine his ability to effect change. Instead of working on issues that the American people care about, like healthcare reform, infrastructure, or ratifying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Democrats have instead decided to continue harassing the Trump Administration with flimsy and unsubstantiated claims.

>**I was elected by the people of Indiana to support President Trump in his efforts to change business as usual in Washington, D.C. That is what I intend to continue to do as your United States Senator.**

>It is an honor to serve as your U.S. Senator from Indiana.  Please keep in touch with me on issues of concern to you. You can also follow me on Twitter or Facebook for real-time updates on my activities in the U.S. Senate.  If I ever may be of service, please do not hesitate to contact me.

>Sincerely,

changemyview,ffdeqdz,t1_ffddkzm,1579819324.0,"Gamestop is providing multiple tiers of service here, beyond the basic retail:customer paradigm.

1) The Heavy User who is basically what I mentioned before.  They come in and buy the new (and often the most basic $60 version) games, beat them, and turn around and use that trade in money to keep the ball rolling.  They don't usually care about any sort of pre-order bonuses because they aren't looking to be in the game for the long haul.

2) The ""My Favorite IP is releasing a Gamestop preorder exclusive!"" crowd is different than the other guy.  They usually have a handful of titles they really give a shit about in a given year and they go all out on the preorder bonuses and whatever.  These people usually do not want to trade their games in-- why would they? These are their big games of the year.  These are your pre-orders and Deluxe Editions.

3) The ""I want the new game, but I've been burned too many times before"" crowd that waits for the $54.99 pre-owned option.  They'll buy it with the guarantee that they can bring it back if they hate it.  Or they can return it anyway for a full refund if they beat it and know it's not a game they are going to come back to, so long as its returned within 7 days. This crowd may keep the game or they may bring it back. Eventually this crowd will trade a bunch of games in, usually during a trade-in event where you can stack bonuses or there's some ""Trade in 2 select games and get an extra $15 towards X"" thing.  This crowd operates in the economy of the near-new.

4) Your budget shopper.  They've got $20 to spend and they want some old Game of the Year mega value pre-owned game that's been out for a long time now.  This game won't be worth much on trade in, but that won't stop this person from trading it in because they need the money for something new."
changemyview,ffdda9p,t1_ffdcuyg,1579818459.0,"You can get new (as in release date) games pre-owned often within a few days to a week of the game coming out.  Sometimes even a day or two.

I used to work at Gamestop like 10 years ago.  The turnaround on games is actually quite high.  A not insignificant percentage of people come in, buy a game, beat it, and return it for trade within a week or two so they can buy something else (and usually if they return fast like this they get around $20-30 for the game).  They're effectively constantly getting half off of new games by doing it this way.

The problem is when people hold on to games for months to years and they lose all their value and then people come in and get mad when Gamestop will only offer a couple dollars."

Non-degree earners are hurt by the fact that tens of millions of young adults cannot participate in local economies because student loans come first.  It's an everybody issue.

I am annoyed no one has suggested the obvious middle ground.  All those federal loans?  Just cancel the interest rates.  Let people's payments go directly to principal so they can actually see a dent when they make payments.

This isn’t as easy as a lot of people would think. You really are asking your parents to go against their faith on this one and not just accept you going against their faith yourself. This isn’t about you or your wedding specifically. This is about asking them to partake in a religious rite outside of their faith. It’s no different than Catholics being forbidden to pray in a mosque. 

Honestly I’m siding with the parents if they decide they will not, as they believe, sin for you. It’s not fair of you to ask a religious person to go against their religion. It’s one thing to ask someone to forgive you for not partaking in what they view as right religious behavior, as you have a right to want a wedding of your choosing, but it’s not right to ask Catholics to sin on your behalf by participating.

Wars are not fought in fighters in this millennia. We do not need new tank divisions that are just going to rust in a field in Virginia.  We would not need new military doctors, engineers, etc if the scale of our military was cut in half.  The biggest air force in the world is the United States Air Force.

I do not sympathize with the ""it helps people get out of poverty"" line.  I am a product of poverty.  In fact, my mother is homeless right now.  If we diverted the bulk of the funds away from the comically oversized military we would have more funds for programs that help alleviate poverty in a real meaningful way.

And for what?  Our only real interest in the area is maintaining imperial interests that wouldn't exist if we stopped pretending to be an empire.  We should not even be there for these people to die in the first place.  We should be at home, providing healthcare and college educations to Americans like the rest of the developed countries on this planet do for their own citizens.  Instead we keep throwing bombs at civilians, radicalizing them and continuing the cycle of violence and then we cast aside any veteran who has the mental scars from doing so.

Same with Chicago, etc. If you’re Chinese or Jewish or Puerto Rican or whatever it’s just easier because that’s where your people are and I don’t mean just families.

I once dated a Vietnamese girl from Chicago. We went down to Argyle one day and her uncle was pointing out all this insider knowledge shit like “if you want to buy a wedding ring talk to this guy, he has good deals on loose diamonds and he knows the family” or you walk into a bake shop and some old grandma gives you free shit because her daughter used to babysit your girlfriend. Or you go into this one restaurant and suddenly it’s like a damn spontaneous family gathering and 5 people come out of the back room and suddenly it’s midnight but everyone is still out here chillin.

I especially agreed with this part:

>We put so much effort into putting the focus on team victory/defeat rather than individual performance. But in 2020, I feel like the over-emphasis on teamplay (while great for hyper competitive players and situations such as OWL), causes a lot of psychological pressure for your average player just looking to blow off steam in a video game. I guess what I am saying is, that in 2020, feeling like you can deviate from teamplay a little bit in OW and have some success feels like a good thing, not a bad thing to me

Like I 100% approve of the theory of team based gameplay.  But it also feels real bad when you don't feel like you can overcome having a shitty player who *isn't* about that teamplay life.  Like if I pop off from time to time I want to feel the reward from that.  A *little* room to ""carry"" would go a long way."

LGBT aren't even a protected class in 2020 and can be and are actively discriminated against in employment, housing, and public accommodations.  Bathroom bans. Kansas and Wyoming are seeking to legally define marriage between same-sex couples as ""parody marriages"".  Tennessee is pushing the ""Natural Marriage Defense Act"" that would prohibit the state from recognizing court decisions that affirm unions between people of the same gender.
