It's a weak argument, and although the President favors it, it's not 100% clear it was going to be brought up at all by the other side.

My point isn't that the Democrats were right to sideline Bernie Sanders, it's that you can't measure how well a candidate will do with the general population by measuring a non-representitive sample, and we should stop narrowing the field to a single candidate from each of two parties, and expecting a good result.
