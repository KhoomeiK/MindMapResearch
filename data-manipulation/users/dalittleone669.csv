intermittentfasting,ffprlnd,t3_euib0h,1580103211.0,Sugar is what I struggle with as well. I could eat a pint of ice cream a day and never get sick of it. I did really well while I was doing functional fitness and was tracking my macros. But then I had to pause the functional fitness bit and just went down hill after that. I gained 30 lbs in the blink of an eye. I've been trying to get my mind right to start IF. I have been missing the catalyst for motivation though.

respiratorytherapy,fcyota7,t3_ejk43g,1578084069.0,"I became a respiratory therapist because after two bad bouts of pneumonia and a massive pleural effusion I realized that I wanted to help people breathe. I always wanted to be a public servant- it's always been my calling. Previously I had been a corrections officer and was getting my bachelor's degree in criminal justice with hopes of working in forensics. But after going through not being able to breathe, I realized how much we all take it for granted. I find that through my own medical history I am able to sympathize with my patients- and that means a lot to me and them."
respiratorytherapy,fcynctn,t1_fcylj68,1578083279.0,"Wow... because their workload is light? Hahahaha. Our workload is not light. We might not do full patient care but we also have way more patients then nurses have. Also, my RN girlfriend makes $5 more an hour than I do. I don't want to sway you from becoming an RT (I absolutely love my profession) but generally nurses don't really understand what all our profession entails (including the schooling)."

lupus,fcoyvch,t1_fcoynlw,1577845406.0,"Oh I understand the tensing up part. And that med is pretty viscous so once it starts going in it is pretty painful. If I could draw a circle on the best spot and send it to you, I would- but I don't know if that's possible on here."
lupus,fcofgmc,t3_ehyai0,1577830956.0,Try a more meatier part of your thigh. Generally injections should go off to the side (more towards the hip). Also make sure that leg is relaxed when you do the injection- so try lying on your right side while injecting it into your left leg. I tried benlysta and used to have b12 shots as well and this is how I did it- on the advice of a wonderful nurse.
lupus,fclm8te,t1_fcljbd7,1577751090.0,"Oh no, I got jerked around quite a bit before I finally got a good rheumatologist put on my case. I am almost certain that my nephritis started because of incompetence when I had the legionnaire's pneumonia. When I was transferred from my local hospital to the bigger hospital I was started on a pretty potent antibiotic that is pretty harsh on kidneys. Well before they started the antibiotic I overheard the nurse asking if they were sure I should get it because I had just been given another antibiotic and the directions state that they should wait at least 24 hours before starting the next antibiotic. Well the nurse was told it was fine... I don't even think it was an hour after they started the antibiotic that my legs started tingling and I couldn't lift them off the bed. When I told the nurse, she had the doctor come look at me. The resident came and visualized my legs and said I was okay. Well I wasn't okay. That was the start of me filling with fluid. I filled so fast and with so much that I have stretch marks on my ankles, the back of my knees, and this really big one on my abdomen (this one infect as my skin stretched apart- which was pretty painful). I feel like the majority of physicians are inept at taking care of lupus patients. This is just a small part of this journey. Luckily I finally had a rheumatologist who was in his fellowship at the time who decided to do the cyclophosphamide to jump start my kidneys. 
I had issues with furosemide as well. I was on a furosemide drip at one point which ended up bottoming out my blood pressure and I passed out when I got up to shower. The furosemide didn't start to work until I was given albumin. But they need to be sure monitor your electrolyte levels while on furosemide because it can wash out your electrolytes. 
All drugs have potential side effects. But we just have to remember that these side effects aren't generally common. The side effects are collected during the drug's clinical trials and anything that anyone reports during the trial is listed as a side effect. I would just be a bit tired the next day and sometimes slightly sick to my stomach. But other than that, I didn't have any issues."
lupus,fclby2x,t1_fcl4uc3,1577744285.0,Thank you for the update! I'm glad you're almost down to your dry weight. I know the thought of the cyclophosphamide is scary- I remember that feeling. I felt like I was signing my life away when I signed to authorize to start treatment. But I am glad that I did it. I don't think I'd be where I'm at today if I hadn't have done the therapy. They will give you benadryl before the infusions and you will sleep right through them. Just make sure you take it easy the next day. You've got this!
