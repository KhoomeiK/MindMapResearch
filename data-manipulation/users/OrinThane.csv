Everyone is like ""Duh Orinthane, thats obvious"" but consider the reason why. I think we assume that it is because we don't physically ""feel good"" and our body is unhealthy but as this thread is showing you are also treated differently based upon your physical attractiveness. I wonder if the mental health issues associated with obesity are also due to the social consequences of being fat and not just the physical ones. If its true many of the health epidemics facing our society, our over prescription of psychiatric drugs, our social alienation, suicide rates are greater contributed to by obesity and how it is dealt with socially."

BreakUps,fdi509z,t3_elb5u8,1578435837.0,"This is a very hard and complicated question to answer. Break-ups aren't specific to which ""side"" you were on. You and your ex are different people, were grown and damaged in different ways over the course of your relationship. This means your grief will be different and how you heal from it, likewise, will be different.   


I do think its probably best that both people take time away from others to sort out what went wrong in the previous relationship and to grow from it. Nobody leaves a long term bond without something to learn and consider, or some wound to heal from. People who jump into a new thing right after they've broken up with a serious partner may have their new thing work but that emotional energy that they haven't dealt with will show itself in some way, and they are leaving their new partner to deal with whatever way that is. They, also, are postponing the lessons their last relationship could have taught them by distracting themselves with a new set of challenges and rewards this new person offers. Complicated.   


There is no best way though, just your way."
quotes,fdaxrnn,t1_fd61ms9,1578251632.0,"I tried to be clear in not blaming the victim. What I meant by it is arbitrary is that it does not change the outcome by holding on to your victim identity at a certain point. Answering that question does not heal you. As someone who has experienced an exceptional amount of trauma and turned my life into something somewhat functional( that I’m proud of), I at some point had to decide to exercise my own agency despite what happened. I had to say, this happened and I had no control of it but who do I want to be now?

I think that is the great tragedy of being a victim, it is left to you to fix. 

I forgave op for assuming I had never experienced pain because they disagreed with my sentiment. I believe that was a statement meant to belittle my view by attacking my character and, in that way it must have been a challenging thing to hear for them. I forgave them for that reactive attack."

getdisciplined,fc6quqm,t3_eger4n,1577487163.0,"I think its important to have a couple expectations.

1. Nothing is certain, even if its likely
2. Nothing lasts forever
3. Nothing is owed to you

Theme? Life is a big question mark and, truly, nobody knows what is really going on here.

I see a lot of people argue that this means that you shouldn't have attachments because it hurts and we should avoid this. I, personally, don't agree.  I think hurt is inevitable and attachment is important to meaning, whether in relationships, actions, or career. I think what is important is that we exercise agency, meaning that we choose what we want rather then feeling compelled to do so. That we choose to rely and invest despite knowing that it is a transitory, elusive, and guaranteed to end  is what makes us human and living beautiful."
getdisciplined,fbys3py,t1_fbyrq89,1577224840.0,"Also, try to cultivate a small routine for self-care. Make a list of things you want to for yourself, stupid stuff like brushing your teeth consistently, and then try to cross off five of them everyday. I find this helpful as well."
