EDM,ff64ppm,t3_errq9z,1579619071.0,They added Ruben De Ronde to Atlanta’s line up!!! I’m hyped!
college,fe6ey1p,t1_fe5s4c2,1578888883.0,Like wise. I bet it was Adventura wasn’t it.
lane8,fe6ewkg,t1_fe6cqnf,1578888848.0,I use Djay Pro so I use Spotify streaming. I’ll record a short mix of two lane 8 songs when I get a chance.
lane8,fdpmtjh,t3_emm9e9,1578633113.0,"My favorite new track so far is Road, haven’t made it through much of the album. But the vocals really did it for me.

Update #1 — that fucking intro into Howling Hand is SICK!

Update #2 — the flood is amazing!! I’ve finished listening to all the new Tracks.

Hands down, Road is definitely #1 for me, then Just!"
college,fcwg638,t1_fcvotpr,1578024776.0,"Well, for the most part it is almost mandatory for freshman to stay in 1 of 3 freshman dorms if they decided to live on campus (and you'd be required to get meal plan.) However, if a freshman lives at home, they could opt out. 

I got lucky and stayed in an upperclassman dorm my first semester that has a meal plan. I did the meal plan for 2 semesters by choice (As a freshman) and sophomore year I decided to cook. 

TLDR - Yep! You can opt out based on dorm situation."
college,fcvo8vv,t3_ej3dps,1578006382.0,Only residents living on campus in a dorm that doesn’t have a kitchen in the room requires a meal plan. Commuters are optional (my school is mostly commuter).
Martingarrix,fct8233,t1_fcs0xu8,1577935341.0,Happy you found it brother! It’s called WOW - Tiesto
lane8,fcrs9wp,t3_eef34m,1577905941.0,I’ve actually mixed Lane 8 in my sets pretty easily. His songs start relatively slow. So it’s easy to create a seamless loop or something like that. Literally just mixed in “Don’t let me go” a few minutes ago actually.
EDM,fco8cux,t1_fcmwsu3,1577826030.0,That’s just depressing
Martingarrix,fcm3j5c,t3_dvo4dk,1577763299.0,Haha my friends! Tomorrow!!!!
EDM,fcm37qy,t1_fclwhpq,1577763062.0,"It was said No Sleep - Dubvision Remix was also made only for live, but it’s coming out at midnight. If anything, this gave me more hope that someone you loved will come out. 

No sleep is almost a year old. So if a remix drops, apparently it’s never too late for one. So I’m fingers crossed for the Someone you loved remix."
Martingarrix,fcivk47,t3_eh624l,1577670848.0,YESSSSSS!!!!!!
Martingarrix,fc4ujl2,t3_eg2ji7,1577428973.0,This song is beautiful of course! I only miss the piano solo after the drop.
