AskGayMen,fdgbl3f,t3_el5f42,1578388745.0,"I came out at 40. 2 predictability disasterous heterosexual marriages, and one fantastic son later preceded the event, and coming out was the easiest thing i ever did.

I thought.

I spent the first 40 years of my life pretending to be other people. Masks, personas...it wasn't pretending to be straight, it was molding myself into an entirely unnatural shape.

I spent the next 3 years pretending that my first serious gay relationship wasn't abusive, one-sided and toxic.

I didn't know who I myself was, I didn't have the strength to identify how bad it was, i didn't see that I deserve better.

I should have had councelling years ago. I am now, and its fantastic.

I've been documenting on YouTube where I'm at and what I'm doing. It's nothing flashy, I'm not a therapist. But if you think it might be helpful, message me and I'll send you a link. I'm going to record my coming out tale today. 

Take care of yourself. Talk to people, and if I can help, tell me what you need."
dogs,fcmlgfy,t1_fcmksrx,1577780239.0,"We don't really have the same rules over here, Rocky is an SBT cross, with a lab i think, and Bella is a full SBT.

Last year SBT's were voted the nations favourite breed.

We experience stigma while we're out and about from time to time, but i guess that's just other people wanting to keep their guys safe, and my two could look a bit intimidating i guess. But legally we're fine, SBT's are not on the Dangerous Dogs act, and are not thought of as Pits over here.

Theres American Staffs, and Irish Staffs which i think are considered Pits and hence are under the act, but my two are fine."
dogs,fcmg0u5,t3_ehxqmq,1577773876.0,"Any hate you have received is dreadful.

I posted my story about the end of my abusive relationship and the fact i was able to retain and secure legal ownership of my two staffies, Rocky and Bella.

Im not 100% sure if mine is the story you are referring to, because I'm a guy (My awful ex is a guy too) and I'm not sure if I really mentioned it.

But, my darling, your comments to me were among the most strengthening words I received over one of the most difficult periods of my life. If someone cannot see the beauty and brilliance of certain breeds of dog, that is their problem. If they cannot see the beauty and brilliance of a kind, compassionate, sensitive and generous member of their own species, that is their curse.

You are the best of us. Love your dogs, whatever shape or size, and just know that far away, in the north east of England there is a little family, bruised but not beaten, down but not out. A gay guy and his two often misunderstood dogs, who all hold you in their very highest esteem."

dogs,fcjlff8,t1_fcg15l7,1577692467.0,"Yeah, Rocky is legally mine, all chipped and sorted.

Bella is chipped but her chip was never registered to anyone, they think she came from a breeder originally and must have squirmed away and been missed when the litters chips were registered. As its her first registration, hers needs to be done on paper, so we're just waiting for the confirmation that she's been registered to me, but there's no real question about who she belongs to.

By the by, I'm a he."

I work for two former very senior police officers, who have been tremendous in signposting me to domestic violence prevention measures, and giving me excellent support.

If he turns up here looking to entertain himself, he won't be finding his trusty old doormat, he'll find a man of Goddamn steel who is more than prepared to deal with his bullshit."

I'm starting to piece my future together, and it's big and scary and it's going to be difficult. But I have amazing people around me and my little ones are safe and well, which makes the whole thing brighter and more exciting.

In a way, I feel blessed. Its been a long strange road, but the end result is me and my dogs, cuddling around the fire planning our future together. And that's kinda beautiful."
AskReddit,fc2zfji,t3_efqzp6,1577377974.0,"Following a week long alcohol binge, my boyfriend turned up at 1:30am on Christmas eve, to wake me up to tell me he wanted to split up.

He's been financially and emotionally abusive for years and was looking for a reaction I think. I told him to just leave then and tried to go back to sleep. But he insisted on having his drunken ramble which I listened to until he decided that he would rather set his dog free to fend for itself than leave it with me.

I adore his dog and mine, and as I'm not a barely functioning alcoholic I am much better suited to care for them both. I prevented this madness of setting him free, and asked, as I no longer believe myself or my dogs are safe, him to leave my property. He called a taxi, told me he'd been seeing someone else, took a bottle of wine and a 4 pack and left.

That takes us to 3:30am. Within the hour he was on the phone, mindlessly drunk and I have no real idea what was being said. The rest of Christmas Eve happened, I finished off the last bits of Christmas prep on auto pilot and went home. A further drunken phone call from him, demanding his stuff. I'd already sent him an email addressing his implied right of access to my property, and detailing a time frame by which I would facilitate his recovery of his property : I wanted a week to inventory what was actually his (not much as all his money and much of mine was spent on alcohol), and then offered a 60 day window up until the end of February for all his stuff to be removed, after which I will dispose of it.

On the evening of Christmas Eve I softened, and sent him a text to say I had bagged up some clothes and his medication and he could send someone to recover it.

At about 11 on Christmas day, his friend that he's staying with arrived, and as I like the girl and don't hold anything against her for helping her friend I invited her in for a cup of tea.

She sat in my living room crying and literally shaking in fear of what she was going to find on her return. His behaviour and alcohol consumption in around 36 hours had already seen her banned from her mothers house for Christmas, and left this lady a wreck. She spent 2 hours with mum and I as I told her the events of just one night with him. She left in tears.

Midnight on Christmas day he's back on the phone with a list of demands. I told him I was not prepared to have that conversation then, and have sent a formal request that I am not to be contacted after 9:30 pm. We agreed that he would, this morning while sober, write a letter granting ownership rights of his dog to me, and a proposal of what he wanted.

The letter was inadequate so had to be rewritten, and he wanted to collaboratively write a list. I advised that the arrangement made last night was different, and I was not willing to sacrifice more time with my family to accommodate him, but he insisted. I looked over the list he produced, we all signed it and I went back to mums.

He's asked for his computer desk, but not the chair. No mention of the computer or several other things. I have no intention to keep this stuff, I want it gone, but nor am I accepting any amendments via panicked text message when he realised his mistake.

I have holes in my bedroom ceiling from where he fell through after hiding in the loft while the police looked for him. I believe it to be incumbent upon him to repair this damage, and told him I'd be taking advice on the appropriate course of action to follow. 

I've had better Christmas's"
AskGayMen,fbsudjj,t1_fbsq4gw,1577060697.0,"He has made an especially fine effort this weekend, and might now be my ex. I guess I'll find out when he wakes up and is sober.

Merry Christmas me."
