fountainpens,fel6t56,t3_eplbhn,1579215295.0,Oof I just took my Chem final and these notes gave me flashbacks. I love your handwriting though.
Journaling,fel62z7,t3_eppeag,1579214845.0,"I find that after I've ranted for a few pages and take a break, when I look back on it I can usually point out my thinking errors and I will write something to counteract all the negative or self hate. Things like "" Yeah I screwed up really bad, but I learned from it"" or "" I know I'm messed up, but my mental health doesnt make me less of a person."" I think that stepping back from it after you write it and going back to it later on helps you find some clarity that you couldnt have before."
fountainpens,fe444d1,t3_enr1o3,1578855638.0,"I love the ink, but I'm also really jealous of that Dalek hiding in the corner."
TIHI,fds0f4w,t3_emqe7o,1578692383.0,This is so cool! I wonder if they use these as part of the costumes for horror movies.
bulletjournal,fdlnxkj,t1_fdlmggp,1578528329.0,"I listened to Hamilton up until ""Non-Stop"" on repeat because I couldnt handle listening to the second half. Finally I listened to the entire thing when I got to ""Who Lives Who Dies Who Tells Your Story"" I was on the bus and hadnt realised I had tears streaming down my face until my friend  asked me if I was okay. Like Dang that got me."
Journaling,fdlmim2,t3_elw487,1578527387.0,"In my bullet journal there are 24 spaces across the width of the page. I draw a bar and in every space I write 1-12, once for am, once for pm. I use a colorcode to fill in things like sleep, school hours, study hours, how much time I spend online, with my family, etc. It sounds like a lot and at first it was, but after about a week I memorized the colorcode and it just became a habit. If I notice I've spent a lot of time online but not a lot of time with my family I will work to change that the next day."
bulletjournal,fdlj5zd,t3_elzz8i,1578525182.0,Love this. This is perfect.
bulletjournal,fdlj3l6,t1_fdlhka8,1578525139.0,Listen to it. It's amazing. A combination of almost every style of music. I first listened to the entire thing on a school bus trip with headphones in. It's my favorite musical of all time.
bulletjournal,fdi4qeo,t3_elcvuk,1578435704.0,I love her designs!
bulletjournal,fdi46yt,t3_elcvuk,1578435427.0,Are those stickers from PlanningWithKay?
bulletjournal,fdi1ock,t3_elaond,1578434157.0,Hell Yeah! I love this tracker and it's nice to learn better ways to track not only your period but your entire cycle. Go you!
bulletjournal,fap7419,t3_eab4vw,1576281537.0,"I was recently diagnosed and I can relate. I love bullet journaling because I track my mood in a year and pixel spread but I dont have to get into ,why, I'm feeling that way. I like stream of concious journaling in a seperate notebook too but when I hit a rough patch oof. I'm torn between wanting to burn it so I never have to read it again, but also keeping it to see how far I've come and the bad doesn't last forever. Sometimes writing it down makes it worse."
