MadeMeSmile,ffdg2aq,t1_ffbhz4q,1579820124.0,"I can calm you down. It is no longer a needle going into your bone, painful as it is. Today you get something called G-CSF (look on wiki) it is a potent stimulant for the hematopoietic stemcells. They divide so rapid that some of the stemcells leave the bone marrow and divide in the blood. From there a doctor collects the blood, then the stemcell are isolated and out in culture to harvest a bigger amount later on. This procedure requires you to take a pill every day for like 2-4 weeks and you have no negative side effects."

But this puffing effect from the effect shown in the video will hardly cause any ear damage. If it was a firecracker then it would have been a whole other story was I trying to say.
