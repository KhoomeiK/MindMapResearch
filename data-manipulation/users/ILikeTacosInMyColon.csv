You talk as if she is heavily ult reliant.

DianaMains,ff8ohx2,t1_ff8obxi,1579688948.0,"I agree that flashing takes out a huge chunk but isn't that the case with most champs like yasuo, riven, fiora etc. I actually feel like her identity is kind of kinky if you ask me. Just imagine you are laning vs a squishy champ with cc but you are a bruiser, you get not much lane prio and same goes with semi tanky champs as an assasin. I feel like the mixed identity really helps in the sense that you can easily opt for burst/ sustained dmg, but that's just my op8nion"

DianaMains,ff8mro5,t3_es93st,1579686311.0,Apparently people at r/dianamains do not. I like her too but I don't get why old mains like the 1 dimensional q to kill kit of hers. How is one shotting even fair and fun? Her new kit allows her to teamfight and also adds room to counter her pretty balanced according to me.
DianaMains,ff8ir4g,t1_ff5r2t6,1579680360.0,If you want to one shot? Yes. If you want to just kill them with at least 5 - 10 seconds to spare? No.

akalimains,ff3pwvv,t1_ff3oa2f,1579546311.0,"Ima be honest, I dislike her too but deleting/nerfing a champ this hard just seems unfair to those who have grinded countless hours learning her. Instead of nerfing this hard, why not take out the part of the champ that everyone including me hate. The *SHROUD*. That would open up room for way more counter play and also would allow us to keep other part of her kit strong."
akalimains,ff3dxin,t1_ff31idb,1579539142.0,"I don't get it, somehow it's balanced to give a champ infinite dashes, 5 man ult possibility a windwall that says 'fuck you adc mains' and no mana spam q(Yasuo). But unbalanced for a champ to get similar to that(Akali). I honestly think the 'toxic' part of her kit is shroud and instead of nerfing her they should remove/rework shroud so that way she still stays powerful but more balanced. Rito just hates akali I guess :/"
