loseit,ff6aq3k,t3_erujl8,1579623069.0,"There are loads of diet plans and programmes out there, but it all comes down to a simple thing, which is: eat less.  Others have recommended MyFitnessPal which is a great place to start.  The fact is, if you take in less energy than you use, i.e. if the calories from your food and drink are less than the calories your body uses to function every day, you will lose weight.

Generally speaking, the various diet plans you will see are all ways of doing the same thing.  They work for some and not for others for a variety of reasons, but it mainly comes down to what people can actually do sustainably.  If you eat a super restricted diet where all you eat is broccoli every day, you will get bored of it and you'll be more likely to ""fall off"".  So the key is to find something that you can do every day without feeling like it's some kind of horrible torture.

For me, that means I need a diet that doesn't limit the type of food that I eat, as long as I keep under the limit I set myself in terms of calories.  For you, maybe you're happy to eat the same meals every day, or you're happy to exclude carbs entirely, or something else.

I'd suggest you start by working out your maintenance calories (another commenter said 2426), and make sure you eat 500 calories less than that every day.  As you lose weight, recalculate that maintenance number so that you're always eating 500 under.  That will lead to a deficit of 3,500 calories a week, which is approximately 1lb of weight loss.

Start simple and keep eating the type of food you eat now, but start logging it in MFP and counting the calories.  If you drink a lot of full sugar soda, try switching that to something sugar free (or water, even better) and see how many calories that saves.  Over time it'll become a bit more intuitive as you see what foods and drinks have more calories, and you can think about changing what you eat as well as how much of it you eat.

Best of luck!

I have also struggled with these issues for most of my life, and what I learned about myself through trying various things, doing well, doing badly etc. was that if I don't have rules for myself, then I find it very hard to moderate how I eat.  Conversely, having too many rules or benchmarks makes me obsessive.  So now I have a more loose set of rules, more like guidelines, and I don't weigh myself or give myself too strict a limit on things like calories - as long as it's in a range that is at a deficit, it's all good - and I keep a record of what I'm doing, as it helps me to hold myself accountable.  But, back when I first got control of my weight and eating habits (some 10 years ago now, I lost a lot then maintained for a few years before a period of illness had me slipping back into old habits), I did a meal replacement keto based diet.  I wouldn't do it now, because it is too rigid, but at the time it literally saved my life.  I was morbidly obese, had been overweight since I was a young child, and absolutely needed that rigid structure to sort myself out.  It gave me a good starting point for learning about nutrition (something that is literally never taught in school where I grew up), and after I finished that, I started reading a lot more about these things and educating myself.

If she wants to take some money *with his knowledge and agreement* that she would otherwise spend on whatever stuff she wants for herself, and save that in a personal savings account, then I don't see why any partner would object to it.

However, your husband ""not liking the idea"" is kind of gross.  Does he give you an allowance?  How much ""fun money"" can you spend on yourself?  It would be fine to just transfer that into your own account every paycheck or whatever.

I don't think not having a separate account is anything to be ""horrified"" by.  How dramatic.  If you have joint accounts that you can both access, and that's where all the income goes, I don't see that it really matters.  I think it's a bit weird to not have your own bank account, and maybe you would want to be building up some credit history of your own, but there's nothing horrifying about it.

intermittentfasting,ff0dtmw,t3_er0u7u,1579467971.0,"This may not be super motivating, so apologies in advance.

What you guys need is discipline, not motivation.  Motivation is how you get started, you think about all the things that you want (feel good, look good, wear [whatever], feel confident in a bikini, shop at ""normal"" shops (if you're plus size)).  Motivation is what keeps you feeling positive and thinking about the next stages.  Discipline is what keeps you going.  You get to the falling off the wagon point and it's discipline that keeps you on there, not motivation.  It's also what gets you back on the wagon before you have been off for so long that you've undone the work that you did already.

How you achieve that discipline is different for everyone, but ultimately it comes down to the same crux which is that it is you, and only you, who controls what you put in your mouth.  The more time you spend building and maintaing a good habit, the easier the discipline becomes, although you will still always need to actively practice it from time to time.  Having a record of what you've done so far helps for some, whether that's an app or a physical diary.  I have a physical diary at the moment that I call my book of shame, because everything I eat is getting logged in that diary, whether it fits with my planned diet or not.  If I think I'm about to hit the fuck-it button and jump off that wagon into a big pile of pizza, that book is going to hear about it.  And I really, really don't want to write ""fuck knows how many calories worth of pizza"" in my book of shame.

I am not preaching to you from some lofty position of being a super disciplined person, by the way.  But I have plenty of experience of trying something, falling off, trying again, falling off for too long, trying something different etc. and I know from that experience that no amount of motivation gets you past the really hard bits if you don't have the discipline alongside it.

Personally, things that help me are:

- Book of shame
- Not weighing myself ever (I get obsessive about stuff and it is bad for my mental health)
- Judging my progress by tangible things like how my clothes fit
- Setting milestones that aren't a number, e.g. my boyfriend notices, a colleague notices etc.
- Rewarding myself with things that aren't food

But that's just me.  Tracking everything is really important for some people.

If the property is being sold presumably your friend has a solicitor. The sale proceeds in the first instance should be paid into the solicitor client account.

It would be unusual in my experience (banker) for a bank to go about this transaction in the way you described, i.e. refunding one party after completion, and obtaining a higher redemption amount than is actually required, just to facilitate that refund.
