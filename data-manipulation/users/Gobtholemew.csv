Hue,ffiyljw,t3_etvvi2,1579985915.0,Discontinuing? Are you sure they're not just sold out? I can find them quite easily on Amazon UK. They were only released a few months back.
Hue,ffih4g7,t3_ets9gt,1579973739.0,"If they're the only Hue lights in the room, just put the lights in the same room. Otherwise, make a zone called ""Master Ceiling Fan Lights"" and put your ceiling fan lights from your Master Bedroom in that Zone. Then you can just say ""Alexa/Google/Siri - turn the master ceiling fan lights on""."
Hue,ffi7hm2,t1_ffhmpq1,1579967104.0,"Came here to say exactly this. They work, but don't always respond to commands. You'll find bulbs ending up in states that are not what you expect, and groups of bulbs all being on different states.

In the end, I regretted buying Tradfri, and had to spend more money migrating everything to Hue. They are SO much more reliable. Plus they act as repeaters, ensuring a much more reliable and longer range ZigBee network."
Hue,ffi72h4,t3_etbigu,1579966800.0,"Definitely can with ""all 4 hue"" on Android. Just edit the rules for the motion sensor. They activate scenes but default, but you can change the action to be simply a turn on command. Similarly, edit the rules the turn the lights off to do exactly that, rather than restoring the previous state. It's actually a simpler behaviour than the default rules."
Hue,ffhv5ur,t1_ffhsp4g,1579955389.0,A great idea. Real data is always better than estimated.

However, I eventually migrated everything to Hue, because I was fed up of my other lights not obeying the commands given to them every time. Imagine telling Alexa to turn the lights on on the kitchen to 100% and say cold white, only for 2 lights to not turn on at all, some turn on but to their previous warm white 50%, some turn on at 50% but do change to cold white, some turn on at 100% but stay warm white, and only one light does as it's told. That was the kind of mess I encountered daily. It just became so frustrating turning the lights off to go to bed, only to have to repeat the command several times, and eventually having too use the power switch to turn them off. Also some manufacturer's cloud took like 5 seconds to respond.

All in the past, thanks to Hue."
Hue,ffep5v2,t3_esk7wd,1579858419.0,"Did you change any of the scenes? I had a similar issue when I wanted to make my own Energize scene (the Hue one isn't 100% cold), and I forgot to update the TBL recipe to use the new scene. I'd deleted the old one, and hence it didn't work."
Hue,ff93cc9,t1_ff92bl7,1579703833.0,"I had a mix of Tradfri, Osram, and Hue. It was always the non-Hue bulbs that didn't accept every command. If I hit the Scene again and again, eventually all the bulbs would end up correct.

In my kitchen, I have 5 lights (two over the area where I eat, and 3 over the prep area). I have similar scenes to you, in that I would often want one half of the room lit. Never had this problem with Hue, but when Tradfri were in the ceiling I did."
Hue,ff8w3km,t3_esaq8t,1579698035.0,"It's this exact issue that made me move from Tradfri to proper Hue bulbs.

I don't know why, but Tradfri bulbs seemed to struggle to do more than one thing at a time (e.g. Turn On, and then set to a specific Scene). So many times I would end up with a room with several Tradfri lights in it, which were all meant to be the same brightness/colour, only to have at least some of them be in some other previous configuration."
Hue,ff8vo50,t3_es9n5h,1579697648.0,"You want the Hue Labs Formula ""Time Based Light"". It allows you to use any of the Hue switches to turn the light on to a given Scene (brightness/colour) depending on what time of day it is.

Of course, not everyone wants to use a Hue Button or Hue Dimmer, so there's also an Automatic version of Time Based Light, which will fade any lights that are On to the ""correct"" scene for that time of day. This has the added advantage that if you switched the lights on during the day (and hence they're bright), they'll automatically fade to a dimmer scene at night."

Hue,ff76jgm,t3_erx0dk,1579642104.0,"There are different types of resources on a Hue Bridge. You can check them in Hue Labs (click the (i) icon next to the picture of your bridge), then Manage Resources. The resources are:

* Geofence users
* Rules
* Routines
* Sensors
* Groups
* Scenes
* Bulbs

You can have up to 63 bulbs, but the bridge struggles more and more once you get to around 50. This manifests itself as lag when turning bulbs on and off, or bulbs being temporarily unreachable. 54 will work, but you may well be in the danger area there.

Adding a bulb only uses up a single bulb resource.

Adding a sensor (e.g. button, dimmer, motion sensor, etc) uses up 1 sensor, but you can also have software sensors which are created to do clever things. But it also uses up some rules. You will need at least 1 rule for each thing your sensor can do. So... a Dimmer switch has 4 buttons (On, Dim Up, Dim Down, Off). If you want each of those 4 buttons to do something when you press it, you'll need to use up 4 rules. If you also want to be able to hold down the Up and Down buttons, that's another 2 rules. If you add one of the Hue Labs Formulas (e.g. Time Based Light), that'll use up some 5 to 15 rules, depending on what the Lab Formula is. A motion sensor also has a light level and temperature sensor, so they use up 3 sensor slots.

Scenes are quickly used up, as each group and zone tends to have a bunch of default scenes, but you also need scene slots for recovery scenes (i.e. to store light states to return to when a motion sensor finishes). So sensors can also have Scenes associated with them.

I have some 30 Hue bulbs and 9 dimmers, but the limits I hit were for Rules and Scenes."
Hue,ff6eghu,t1_ff6cua2,1579625422.0,"I agree. I noticed my bridge struggling too, and I was running out of resources. A second bridge did solve that issue, but created the Alexa issue.

Hue,ff6c97a,t1_ff6c5e2,1579624044.0,"Silver lining :D

YouShouldKnow,ff4hyf1,t3_erlhaj,1579564051.0,"I'm not worried...

Looking at the table in the article, most people (that's people using consumer grade SSDs) can expect their SSD drives to last upwards of 244 weeks (assuming stored at 25C after being powered off, which seems high given most people prefer around 20C or 21C ambient temperatures) and 50C when running. If they're stored at lower than 25C when powered off, it'll last longer. In fact, if you look at the table, life expectancy is pretty much doubling for every 5C drop in storage temperature. So if you extrapolate that table down to 20C, it looks like you can expect 10 years of life after the drive is powered off.

If I've not used a drive in 10 years, I'm not likely to be worried about its contents degrading.

Now if you run enterprise grade SSDs, that hang around in hot places after being powered off (e.g. a NAS rack), then, yes, this is important."
Hue,ff49ik4,t3_erh0nb,1579558483.0,"You can set the colour temperature in apps like ""all 4 hue"" on android. So whatever you think ""pure white"" is, e.g. 6000K, you can set it to that. The temperatures are reasonably accurate, and at least accurate to human perception (i.e. + or - 500K).

The thing is that this is all interpretive. One person's ""pure white"" is someone else's ""cold white"" and someone else's ""daylight"". Furthermore, unless every item in your room is also the same colour, these objects will reflect different coloured light, and change the colour temperature."

Your phone will detect that your home WiFi does not have a good internet connection, and will fall back to mobile data. You can turn this functionality off in the (advanced) network settings.

You won't be able to use smart assistants, non-zigbee switches (e.g. Logitech Pop), or anything else that requires the internet/cloud to work.

You can still control your lights using ZigBee switches, such as the Hue Dimmer, and you can use the app so long as your phone is genuinely connected to your WiFi, and your phone is actually using it rather than mobile data. To test the latter, with your internet down, open a browser on your phone and see if you can browse the internet. If you can, you're NOT connected to your home WiFi properly."

I now regret those decisions and have migrated everything to Hue, because they work all the time. The biggest issues for me were the unreliability of other brands. Many times I'd tell lights to turn on/off or change colour, via voice or switches, or IFTTT, or timers/routines, and often the non-Hue bulbs would not do everything I asked.

Picture your 9 Tradfri bulbs, where 3 of then are cold white, 2 of them are warm white, 2 of them are dimmer then the others, and the rest just didn't turn on. That's the kind of mess I had when I told them to turn on and then set to cold white, and 100% brightness. Repeat all the commands and you might fix 1 or 2 of the bulbs, but the rest will stay at the wrong settings.

By comparison, while a Hue bulb occasionally misbehaves, it must be months since I last experienced it, and every light in my house is Hue."

I know it's possible to get this to work as I've done the same thing with one of my dimmer switches (one press of the on button turns it on, and the second turns it off).

Add New Condition, Motion, Trigger Condition, scroll right down to bottom and select""presence"" and ""With delay after sensor was updated"", and set a time there which is the minimum time you want your light to be on for before monitoring for motion again.

Hue,fea5cor,t1_fea484r,1578944545.0,"For now, I would test we can turn it off, and if that works modify it to save and recover the previous state...

Hue,fea1qwh,t1_fe9nou6,1578943447.0,"It looks like you've done it! So now if you turn your light of, then trigger the motion sensor, what happens? I'd expect the light to go on..."
Hue,fe9edk9,t1_fe98hen,1578936832.0,"If you don't have any other switches/sensors, etc. Sure.

But you don't need to look at All rules. Your need to find the Accessory (search for your motion sensor) and show the rules associated with it. That's what the ability to just look at rules associated with a given sensor is for, so your don't have to look at hundreds of irrelevant ones. There are lots of rules for it, because you will have a rule for switching it on during one time range, another for the second time range, rules to dim the bulb to 49% when no motion is detected, and a rule to turn it off after a set time, and rules to save the various states the light can be in. I have 11 rules for my outdoor sensor that's configured with the default settings in the Hue app. But only one turns it off. Or actually, it sets the scene to recoveryScene which was saved by another rule. That's because my motion sensor is set to revert to its previous state when no motion is detected, rather than switch off.

Another way is to totally simplify it and disable all the rules for that motion sensor (so if things go wrong you can just turn them back on) and write your own 2 rules.

If you do that, your rule to turn on will need 2 conditions... Motion Sensor Presence Detected, and Motion Sensor Presence Updated. With Actions Turn On Light and either Activate Scene or Set Brightness + Colour. You can then test this once it's saved. If the light turns on when you move near the sensor then copy the rule, add another condition that the Light is On, and change the Actions so that it just turns it off. Remember to Activate the rule, as copied rules are off by default. I don't know how quickly it'll respond to two activations in a row... I suspect it'll only trigger every 30 or so at most. But if the delay is too short you can change the condition in the Off rule to that it uses the mode ""with delay after the sensor was updated"" and set the delay to whatever you need."

You might want to consider disabling it in the Hue app, then creating the simplest configuration in all 4 hue to turn it on. Then find the motion sensor in Accessories, and select Find Rules For Sensor to display all the rules. They often just have numerical names. There may be a surprising number of them too. You'll have to go into each rule to find out which has an activity at the bottom that says to turn in a light or scene. That's the one that you'll need to copy. You can make sure that's the right rule by disabling it and seeing if your light stops turning on. Then once confirmed, enable it, copy it, and modify the copy in the way I tried to describe earlier."

Turning on X lamp with Y scene when motion is detected is standard.

You'd then duplicate that rule for the sensor, but add a condition that the light is already on, and change the action from Turn On Light and Turn on Scene, to Turn Off Light. This will hence only run if motion is sensed and the light is already on. When those two conditions are met it'll turn off the light."

I'd like to be able to say ""Alexa, lights on"" and have the lights turn on to the same scene using the Dimmer Switch would have resulted in.

Currently, the issue I have is that turning the lights on with Alexa results in the light turning on with whatever settings they were using when they last turned off. If that happens to be Energize, because they were last used at 8am, and it's now 3am, it hurts.

While the data sharing between your account and their Hue account is somewhat one sided (you can see their lights and control them), they may also be able to see things like your email address (username) in their Hue account under the list of linked services.

For example, a dimmer switch will have a variable (Memory Sensor) to record what scene it's cycling through when you press the On button multiple times, and one to record the scene when turning off so it can recall it when turning back on. The motion sensors have ones to record the presence state, and so on.

However, returned goods are often sold at reduced prices by the seller (e.g. Amazon), or bundled together into boxes of random stuff that people can also buy, and never returned to the manufacturer. Sellers are not responsible for, qualified, and in many cases can't, reset equipment before selling it on.

So the lesson here is to always factory reset stuff, and remove stuff from cloud accounts (e.g. Hue and Alexa in this case) before returning or selling them. Just like you would with an old mobile phone - you wouldn't want some random person having access to all you email, Facebook, pictures, etc."
Hue,fdhs38q,t3_elfgwz,1578429094.0,"Scenes can be bulb specific, rather than room specific. I hit this issue myself when I moved a bunch of bulbs around in my house and only the bulbs that were originally in the room worked with the room's scenes correctly. So if you're turning them on with a scene, try deleting that scene and recreate it (with all 4 bulbs)."
Hue,fdhb7iu,t3_el2e1c,1578419256.0,"I had this issue too. There are three solutions...

1. Change your smart plug to a Hue or ZigBee compatible. This is the route I went down eventually and don't regret it.
2. Buy a Smart Switch, such as a Logitech Pop, which can control devices from multiple vendors. Configure it to turn your Hue and Aukey plug on/off. I originally went down this route, but as everything is controlled by the cloud there's an infuriating 2 or 3 second delay before stuff happens.
3. Use an Alexa or Googe Home Routine. E.g. set it to respond to ""Alexa, illuminate"" and then add the commands to turn your Hue Lights and Aukey Plug on. I have also gone down this route, but the issue is that you have to make routines for every type of usage you need, such as one for 50% brightness, one for 75%, one for 25%, one for Off, one for On, and so on, and you need to think of and remember the activation phrases for these, which need to be different from the standard commands you can issue to your voice assistant."
Hue,fdhaj1a,t3_el1h0n,1578418895.0,"Other than turning on, a Hue Bulb cannot be controlled while it's off. When a Hue Bulb turns on, it always turns on with the same setting it had when it was off. This means that if a light was on at 100% and then switched off, and then later you switch a light on at 50%, it will turn on at 100% first, then it receives the command to reduce to 50%.

There isn't a fix for this.

There is, however, a workaround. If you're using a Hue controller, such as a Hue Dimmer Switch or Motion Sensor, use an app like ""all 4 hue"" on Android to directly edit the rules for that controller. Change the rule for pressing the Off button (or what happens when when no motion is sensed), so that it dims the light to 1% before turning it off.

That way, when the light is switched back on, it'll turn on at 1%, before changing to the Scene / Brightness that you actually want. I feel this is better than turning on at some other brightness (e.g. 100%) and dimming down to the value you want."

The Hue Ecosystem doesn't need any network connectivity to work. You only need to give the bridge access to the internet if you want to get firmware updates, control your setup when away from home, or use other cloud services like Amazon Echo / Google Home / IFTTT, etc.

If things really go bad (e.g. your Hue Bridge dying), then you can still use your Hue bulbs just like normal lightbulbs by switching them on/off at the wall. They turn on at maximum brightness. Unless, of course, you've explicitly changed this behaviour in the Hue App."
YouShouldKnow,fdbpsji,t3_eki0z9,1578259990.0,"Some of that is right...

Original halogen headlights have a colour temperature 3,200K (yellow) to 5,000K (daylight appearance).

Xenon bulbs take those colour temperature ranges higher, from 4,000K (slightly warm white), to 6,000K (bright pure white). Some Xenon bulbs have a blue glass coating which can take the colour temperature higher still, maybe up to 7,000K (a sort of ice blue).

Aftermarket HID bulbs are readily available in colour temperatures ranging from 3000K (golden) to an insane 12,000K (purple white). Blue looking ones are around 10,000K.

LED headlights can have a variety of colour temperatures too, but they're harder to find in extreme colours, and more expensive. You can't really perceive a colour difference of anything less than a few hundred Kelvin, so 5,500K to 6,200K are common LED colour temperatures as that's what's in demand and what all car manufacturers use, but it's moot as they pretty much all look the same colour within this range.

HIDs don't have to be ""aftermarket"" - many cars, including my last 3, came with HIDs from the factory.

LEDs can also be factory fitted or aftermarket.

Both HIDs and LEDs from the factory tend to be around 6,000K (Bright Pure White), give or take a few hundred. Research by Audi say 5,700K is the best colour to use for the human eye.

The bottom line is that any of these bulb technologies can look blue, it just depends what someone buys.

However, when seeing a factory fitted halogen bulb next to a factory fitted HID or LED (e.g. as you see several oncoming cars passing you at night), the HID or LED will look ""bluer"", and this is often what people mean when they refer to ""those blue looking headlights"". Aftermarket bulbs, of any technology, can look very blue, but these aren't necessarily what people are referring to, they could be referring to factory fitted Xenon, HID, or LED, because they all look ""blue"" when compared to traditional halogen bulbs.

However, I don't think they're the issue. The biggest issue is people that buy aftermarket LED or HID ""upgrades"", and don't adjust them properly, or at all. They're often pointing too high. For this reason, LED and HID headlights here in the UK must, by law, have a computerised automatic levelling system. People also buy bulbs that are (often illegally) brighter (e.g. 120W Halogen Bulbs, or equivalent HID/LED). These are two issues that dazzle people the most."
YouShouldKnow,fdauq4h,t1_fdasw54,1578250435.0,"For small aperture cameras, below the cost of a medium sized house, yes.

For night vision you either have IR lights (detectable), big lenses to collect lots of light (obvious), or very expensive camera modules that are super sensitive. Alternatively you can go for things like thermal imaging, but again they're expensive, especially when small."
Hue,fdaam1s,t3_eke3q3,1578243748.0,"Make sure the names for your individual lights are VERY different from the name of the room/zone of lights, otherwise Alexa will think you want to control a specific light. You can see what Alexa things you said by going to the settings in the Alexa app, and I think it's then in Account, then History, and it'll show you the text of everything its heard. Check it heard you right and see if it's struggling to correctly identify the light/room names.

Anyway, if you have a Room called ""Bedroom"", and a light in there called ""Bedroom Light"", and another called ""Bedroom Desk"", and you say ""Alexa, turn the bedroom lights on"", it will likely control the singular ""Bedroom Light"", rather than the lights in the room called ""Bedroom"".

So, instead, call the Room/Zone whatever you want to use to control the lights ""Bedroom"" is fine. Call your lights something long and different like ""Bob's Main Bedroom Light"".

All of the above is in the Hue App, not Alexa. Get Alexa to search for devices to get it to find the name changes. Make sure the names have changed in the Alexa app as what is in the Alexa app is what Alexa will try and use.

Another thing you should do, is in the Alexa app add your Echo devices to the rooms that they're in. For example, if you have an Echo in your Bedroom, then edit the Bedroom room in Alexa, and add the Echo that's in the Bedroom too. Then, you just need to say ""Alexa, lights on/off"" and Alexa will turn on/off all of the lights in that Alexa room. It's a great shortcut.

Finally, if stuff still doesn't work, you can always make an Alexa routine with a custom phrase that turns your bedroom lights on."
Hue,fda7z9s,t1_fd39uk5,1578242758.0,"OK, so we've eliminated the power supply and the Hue Bridge being the issue.

My next two suspicions would be the mains supply to the power supply. If it's on an extension, make sure it's reliable and not loose.

After that it would be the ethernet connection. If there's a power discrepancy or a ground leak on your Router then that could cause issues. To test this, simply unplug the ethernet cable from the back of the Hue Bridge and see if it reboots. Make sure your Router isn't trying to give Power Over Ethernet to the Bridge (it probably isn't).

Yes, you're 0 years old when you're born, but the age of something has absolutely nothing to do with the design of the Gregorian calendar, that most of the world uses.

Bear in mind that the Gregorian calendar was created in 1582, and based on previous calendars, such as the Roman Calendar, all of which started at least 40 years after BC/AD divide.

*For whatever reason*, it was decided that the calendar years close to the BC/AD divide went...

3 BC, 2 BC, **1 BC, 1 AD,** 2 AD, 3 AD, etc.

**Note there is no year 0 AD, or 0 BC, or 0 anything.** Right or wrong, it's just how they decided it would work.

Therefore, the first decade (10 years) of AD consisted of the years 1 AD, 2 AD, 3 AD, 4 AD, 5 AD, 6 AD, 7 AD, 8 AD, 9 AD, and 10 AD. The second decade was 11 AD to 20 AD, the third decade was 21 AD to 30 AD and so on.

**Note that decades always start with a year number that ends in a 1, and end on a year number that ends in a 0.**

As such, the current decade doesn't end in 2019 (ending in a 9) it ends in 2020 (ending in a 0), just like every AD decade in the Gregorian calendar. Conversely, BC decades always start with a year ending in a 0, and end in a year ending in a 1.

There are other calendars that do have a year 0, such as Astronomical, Buddhist, and Hindu calendars, but most of the world most of the time uses the Gregorian calendar.
