tumblr,ffj16jd,t1_ffixa8s,1579987795.0,"pretty much, kinda. from what I understand, Christianity treats Jesus as God whereas in Islam he's only a prophet. 

as for chronology, I think it kinda lines up. according to books, the prophet Muhammad was born around 600 AD, which explains the 600 year delay with gregorian calendars. heck, we share stories going far back from Adam & Eve.

nothing wrong with being interested~
I'd like to think so too. let's take the various stories of disasters from scriptures. without the proper knowledge, it's easy to understand if people back then reacted to them as acts of god."
