scoliosis,ffppwdw,t3_eucxr4,1580101611.0,"Ugh, i know how you feel you poor thing. Do hot baths or showers help at all? 
My mum says to me when I'm overwhelmed with pain, what is upsetting you the most right now?
And once that's fixed, I feel calmer already. 

Do you stretch? Have you got a spikey ball to lie on? My physio told me to lie on the floor, with my spikes on each shoulder blade and each glute, 2ish minutes at a time which can help the pain, I LIVE on my spikes! 

I've got a couple of balls and several sticks with 5 smaller, spikey balls on it which I also love. I have them all over the house and in my car. 

If You look on Google or eBay and type: spikey massage stick you will see them.

If you want to message me please feel free, I've been dealing with scoliosis and chronic pain for about 18 years now and I'm 31! 

We can help each other though, as much as other people try to understand, it's one of those things that you can't understand unless you've been through it."

I have started to just file my nails, while watching tv and even that makes me feel a bit better. 
I got argon oil for my hair, which makes it sooo soft.
