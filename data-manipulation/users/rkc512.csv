boulder,fd005n6,t1_fczxoo0,1578111628.0,"There was a great essay in boulder weekly’s essay edition about that. When I moved here 8 years ago, I heard Chief Niwots “curse” to be along the lines of “once you’re here, you’ll never leave. If you do, you’ll come back.” Not much of a curse, but the actual quote is, “People seeing the beauty of the valley will want to stay, but their staying will be the undoing of the beauty.” Good on boulder for preserving, but the consequences, well, we all see it."
