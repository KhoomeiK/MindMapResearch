Once you finish the main story, it would be worth shelling the money out to add IB for the new moves, abilities, and monsters, when you can.

If you don't enjoy the gameplay loop of kill/capture stuff, get loot, forge better gear, kill/capture stronger stuff, get better loot, forge even better gear, repeat, then this isn't for you.

MonsterHunterWorld,fffxghy,t3_etelbv,1579893928.0,"You can add fuel to the steamworks, but honestly unless you're adding dragonvein stuff, it's not worth it. Everything else gives at best about 5 units of fuel per 1 piece donated. Most are only a 1-1 or 2-1 ratio. Dragonvein stuff starts at 20 and goes up from there. The order is entirely random but in my experience if the previous answer was a straight left to right, or right to left, and you messed up, it seems like there's a high chance it'll be that same combination the very next round. It also seems like center right left is much more common than center left right. There's no tells to look for, and it's possible that my information is just my perception and nothing else, but it seems to work for me. Basically either just guess or hold down the RT and hope for the best. 

Two caveats: if the button prompts turn red, it seems like straight across in either direction are the most likely answers, but it pays to make your best guess since you get significantly better rewards. And if the cats pop up next to each prompt, STOP! Just do what they tell you: they're literally giving you the answers. It's free rewards for just doing whatever they tell you to."

That said... If you're rage quitting because of how long things take, this might not be the game for you. This is one you play for fun, and while speedrunning is a thing, it's not a real option for most people, so if you need fast fights, it might be time to move on."

Even among predators. Nothing I've said actually argued with any of your point.

wolves,ff8ls8z,t1_ff8cid0,1579684782.0,"That's also true. But it's not like ranchers can't tell the difference between animals that have been getting eaten and those that haven't, so it's not really scapegoating either. Sure, some of them were probably already dead when they were found by coyotes, but it's unlikely that explains even half of the ones found being eaten.

That said, both animals are probably receiving more than their fair share of hate from ranchers. Considering the time and expense that goes into raising cattle, especially on a ranch, each animal lost brings the rancher that much closer to financial ruin. When they already lose so many to sickness, injuries, and weather, it's entirely too easy to take that fear and frustration out on the one thing you can control: predators."
