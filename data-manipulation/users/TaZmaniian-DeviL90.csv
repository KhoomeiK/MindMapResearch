sex,fffiv7s,t1_fffin6o,1579884913.0,"That's fair and that's your opinion. He refuses to talk to you about it to hear you put properly tho. Also it's not really a shallow reason when you partner isnt meeting your sexual needs. Honestly, check out r/relationshipadvice"
sex,fffieu2,t1_fffi39h,1579884636.0,You can stop putting up with it. You don't have to stay if you're not happy.
sex,fffhtp5,t1_fffhpdk,1579884275.0,If he can't sit down and have an adult talk about sex and the problem you have with the lack of it then he's refusing to communicate with you on issues that need to be dealt with dude. How old are you two?
ireland,fffhb9k,t1_fffeaek,1579883954.0,This is my exact thinking on it.

Coronavirus,fff2uh5,t1_fff2jjt,1579874199.0,"No that's not what I'm saying. I'm in work so can't stand around writing a fucking essay for you. I know enough about it to know ""China bad"". For example the way they reacted when reports of the virus were first coming out. Like threatening the people trying to report it. 

There's 1 example for you and that's enough. Go outside and do something other than argue on Reddit over some stupid fucking detail."
trippinthroughtime,ffezkur,t1_ffez9rf,1579871440.0,That's not a universal thing in Ireland. I think we tend to pretty good with that stuff. I just work in a factory run by arse bandits.
insaneparents,ffeys1j,t3_et7hv6,1579870696.0,Fucking cunt deserves to die in her child's place for even putting it in a position like this.
Coronavirus,ffeyawl,t1_ffey7du,1579870239.0,"I genuinely don't know. I haven't had time to sit down and do some proper reading yet, still at work. That was just what I've seen on a number of different posts. Open to any and all info about this if anyones got any."
trippinthroughtime,ffey4be,t1_ffey1xc,1579870061.0,Exactly! Shits completely fucked! Although not as bad as America here but shits still fucked.
trippinthroughtime,ffey2o9,t1_ffexx3g,1579870015.0,"Fucking Ireland lol. I get 2 paid sick days. Last 4 years they've forced me to use them for days I've missed even tho I've told them not to. Then when I actually needed them I had to take the hit in my pay which then priced me out of visiting the doc. Had to work 2 weeks with a viral infection, running to the bathroom every 15/20 mins to get sick or shit lol."
ireland,ffewuvr,t1_ffew9wf,1579868788.0,"I get you but the way China's acted with this by trying to push it down hoping to will go away now has a suspected case in Belfast, uk and Scotland. Some a bit too close for my liking. I get what you mean tho and you're stupidly right lol."
ireland,ffevu9w,t1_ffevhm2,1579867698.0,That's right now tho. That numbers going to fluctuate of there's more fatalities directly related to the virus. What's the harm in a post asking people to stay safe and keep good hygiene when something like this is going on?
sex,ffevrhj,t1_ffel0z7,1579867608.0,You could just talk and explain that the lack of sex is becoming a problem.
ireland,ffev76b,t1_ffeuzov,1579866952.0,How do you gather that? Considering the amount of cases already.
science,ffeunx2,t3_et5eym,1579866307.0,It's a let down lol
Coronavirus,ffeua9k,t1_ffeozzo,1579865826.0,But this virus came from a specific market in China known for selling animals illegally
