Best of luck with your move! I hope it all goes well."
blop,ff6e5qq,t3_erwbr0,1579625236.0,"Has lil baby been seen for his eye yet? I had a foster with glaucoma and the vet said it’s not too common in cats and sometimes it means there are other issues. I hope that’s not the case with your little cutie, but worth looking into either way since it can be painful for them. Not trying to scare you, I’ve just only seen this the one other time so it kind of jumped out at me. 

I wish you and your adorable void much health and happiness!"

The Vesper in Campbell 


Both have quality drinks and attention to detail, I prefer the vesper over amandine but obviously Los Altos is a hell of a lot closer than Campbell, and the place is still really good."
Sunnyvale,fewjy33,t3_eqs0ya,1579412216.0,This is extraordinarily gross.
sanfrancisco,felsh8z,t3_ept98g,1579229824.0,Very important question: sweater or sweater vest?
SkincareAddiction,feclhp0,t3_eodh5o,1578976857.0,"Do you not like the little spatulas that come on the lids? I was gifted tatcha by a friend who wasn’t enjoying it after a few uses, and I’d just wash the spatula, towel dry, and put back each time. Didn’t have any issues. Different strokes for different folks, though!"
MadeMeSmile,fecl909,t3_eob8q1,1578976683.0,Haha I’m just picturing him being super excited and offering everyone nearby a soda pop so that he has an excuse to open a bunch of them :)
nursing,fecfsbu,t1_fe6tchj,1578972867.0,This is terrible and I love it.
nursing,fecfpjb,t1_fe6prfb,1578972815.0,"Nope, it’s just floor stock but they use omnicell for everything so that supplies can be refilled before we run out. The problem is that people just take whatever they need without marking it as removed, so we end up running out of stuff all the time anyway."
Shoestring,fecfgz1,t1_fecctr9,1578972655.0,"It’s not been in place for very long, so there are plenty of people who may not know :) I went with a bicycle tour group five years ago and I don’t think the permit system was in place yet because there were SO many cars trying to park. It was pretty insane.
The view was something that will stay with me too - sunrise up there is easily one of the most amazing things I’ve seen and felt."
Shoestring,fecc3gp,t1_fecam72,1578970486.0,"Quick note - if you want to go up to Haleakala in a private vehicle you do need a permit now. You can get them online, I think it costs a couple bucks (which does not include entry fee to the national park - just reserves your spot so they can limit congestion at the summit for sunrise)"
Shoestring,fecbqi1,t1_fec8bos,1578970289.0,I can not recommend this enough. Used the app during my trip last summer and it was awesome.
Shoestring,fecbnys,t3_eoe3dc,1578970252.0,"Maui budget rental car is the cheapest I’ve found, I use them every time I go (which is usually once or twice a year - flying from the west coast is cheap and easy)

The cars are definitely not fancy, I usually end up with a car that’s at least a few years old and usually has a few dents and dings (but never any mechanical issues) 

The process is a little weird - they don’t have a proper storefront at the airport so they just bring the rental to the airport parking lot and you handle the transaction there. Then when you’re leaving the island you leave the car in the parking lot with the key under the mat. It made me uncomfortable the first time but I’ve used them 6 times now and I haven’t had any issues. 


Definitely worth looking into if you want to save some money! 



Not what you asked for, but if you want to do a “splurge” activity I would really recommend a snorkel trip on the pride of Maui. They serve breakfast and lunch on the boat, provide everything you need, go to great spots, and really just run a good operation. I’ve gone out with them twice, including a trip last summer, and it was well worth the money both times."
nursing,fea9ko3,t1_fe6nkl8,1578945978.0,"We keep everything in the omnicell but it’s all floor stock so patients don’t get charged by item. Supposedly it’s for inventory control to keep units from running out of things, but since people  take things without marking them as removed the counts are off all the time anyway. Really annoying."
nursing,fe6n9fn,t1_fe6l9yb,1578896799.0,This is too real. We never have enough of the xl ones in our omnicell and at least once a week we have to go beg a few pairs off another unit.
OldManDog,fdop3cq,t3_embyt0,1578609722.0,Holy shit this is cute. Thank you.
Jeopardy,fdo33sj,t1_fdo1fu8,1578598011.0,"That’s an interesting reading of it, I definitely hadn’t thought it through that way. It felt too straightforward in the moment but I’m sure it’s easy to overthink the question in that context"
Jeopardy,fdnpe74,t1_fdnokcs,1578590386.0,"I agree. It's funny because I came into this tournament hoping for a James victory while simultaneously fearing that Ken would be shut out because of the buzzer discipline of the other two. The first two games have not gone as I would have expected, in part because of Brad blowing the DDs but also seeing Ken come out so aggressive and so hungry. 

Excited to see if Brad gets his mojo back tonight, I'd love to see this stretch on as long as possible."
Jeopardy,fdnodr6,t3_elyu03,1578589906.0,Perfection
Jeopardy,fdnoa0e,t1_fdnlsbn,1578589855.0,That was super disappointing because it was not a hard question. I feel like Brad doesn't have his head in the game this time around.

aww,fcwulfn,t1_fctya8z,1578038262.0,"I adopted an elderly dog with long, brittle nails and the groomer actually used a drimmel tool to file her nails down for the first year or so. After that the quicks had shortened considerably and her nails were no longer brittle, so she could have her nails cut the regular way without it being painful for her. I don’t know how common it is but filing doggy nails down to a shorter length can be an option when cutting is impractical :) 
Good luck!"

I know it will get better but it helps to see the other new nurse posts here and know I’m not alone in the meantime."
