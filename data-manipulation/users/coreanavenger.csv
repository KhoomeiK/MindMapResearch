MovieDetails,ffxhryr,t1_ffx3e17,1580325412.0,"Part of my justification was that James was a dick first, and just because he became a ""good guy"" after he got with Lilly, that doesn't excuse his bullying of Snape. He basically taught Snape how to bully. So Snape bullies Harry, at least not physically. It's a nuanced situation and I guess I understand that rejection and jealousy too closely."
MovieDetails,ffwq6hb,t1_ffwo43c,1580308316.0,Maybe this is why my daughter hates Snape so much. She says he was too cruel. I felt his motivation was sympathetic but misguided. She read the books and I didn't though.

AskReddit,ffver3d,t1_ffv3h00,1580262404.0,"No, you're more than likely okay unless you are an alcoholic and/or take Motrin or Tylenol several times every day.  Even then, at your age, you can recover if you stopped those things. 

Either one is fine if you're talking about an occasional night of party drinking (say twice/month). Acetaminophen does affect your liver, so if you drink alcohol (a lot), then yes, that is putting your liver at more risk.  

Ibuprofen (Motrin) is okay sporadically too. Daily use can cause stomach ulcers (that can bleed) and frequent alcohol doesn't help either.  

Once in a while, staying hydrated, and not binge drinking every week into oblivion, and you'll be okay, while you're young at least."
AskReddit,ffve9sc,t1_ffv8u2b,1580262081.0,"Motrin is ibuprofen so bang, say goodbye to kidneys and hello to stomach ulcers. Xanax is addictive, so hello to whole new problems."
AskReddit,ffve656,t1_ffuxny5,1580262013.0,"Six to eight tablets of what dose size? Acetaminophen comes in different sizes: 325 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg. The max dose for 24 hours is 4 grams, half that if you have liver disease. Several other meds have acetaminophen in them too, like Norco, Oxycodone, Fioricet, etc.  

Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or Naproxen or aspirin or Alleve, etc, all can cause kidney failure and stomach ulcers. The kidney issues can likely be avoided if you drink a lot of water and you have healthy young kidneys. The stomach ulcers are somewhat inevitable if you take several tablets a day for months to years. Taking with food helps. Taking with Prilosec or Protonix might help more. But it's better to limit usage if possible."

dndnext,ffr1z0e,t3_eu6y0z,1580148695.0,"Hard to say only hearing one side of the story. You present some red flags yourself:

\- Your friends recommended him but you're the only one who has a problem with him.

\- You even complain that you're the first one to be attacked just because you're ""hiding.""

Maybe there's some legitimacy somewhere in here but it's kind of suspicious that six ""bad"" things happen in one session with an experienced DM that your friends respect.
