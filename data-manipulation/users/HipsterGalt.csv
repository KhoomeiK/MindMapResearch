When those old craftsman are oiled up they do glide nicely. I'm just a sucker for a high tooth count ratchet. I think the black huskies are a pro line if sorts. I have the 1/2"" drive extended handle and love it except that the black chips and wears rather easily but yeah, they're great tools for the price and feel smooth. I opened mine up after about 3 years to clean the lapping compound out of them (occupational hazard lol) and they were in surprisingly good shape.

Really, if I were you, I would spend some time to find the set that best matches what you need on a regular basis so you get the most versatile set for yourself. You can get them in a mix of VDE and standard, you could grab integral shank drivers or bit and handle, they make a very nice tool and plenty of options. 
Also, on the rubber note, my VDE drivers have been regularly doused in lapping compound and mineral spirits since getting them about 5 years ago, so far so good on the rubber breaking down but ymmv."
Tools,fdp0tnv,t1_fdp0nv9,1578617311.0,They do come in sets. Do you do electrical work requiring insulated screwdrivers? Are you a wood elf who is going to hammer on them? Do you want them in the most available options for a standard screwdriver?
Tools,fdozoqg,t1_fdoxv24,1578616556.0,"So, I have weird taste in tools, fair warning. I hate snap on with a passion, but would love a set of Hazet combination  wrenches that cost twice as much due to their form. I wouldn't buy Wera wrenches for similar reasons. I love proto tools and will typically take them when offered at a good price. Armstrong makes one of the best torque wrenches on the market in my book, I had a job where torque wrenches were uber critical and we ran comparisons left and right, Armstrong consistently came out on top so we threw out all the rest and bought armstrongs for the shop. That said, I love my Wera torque wrench which I didn't quite expect, honestly. I bought it on amazon.de for like half of what they go for in the States. The grip will probably fall apart quickly though as it's got a rubber grip and I mostly use it on a gear grinder so it gets an oil bath regularly. It seems accurate, the mechanism is very nice and it didn't have the price tag of a Rahsol. Now, wrenches aside, Were fucking shines in bit drivers, I was the guy who never kept bit drivers around, fuckin' hated em. The Wera bits are shaped to grab like hell though and they do. Their screw drivers can be bought in 1000vde and the blades detatch from the handle to snap in the next one so instead of a drawer full of screwdrivers, you have a nice sophisticated tool roll. That's another key point, their tool rolls rock and are apace saving in a box and a god send for service guys. Their allen wrenches have the same biting characteristic as their screw drivers and feel great in the hand. The only downfall of their hex plus line is that because they're a round shank, if you somehow break it, you're SOL and you can't always sneak it into places you can get a straight allen key. Otherwise, wouldn't trade them for the world. They make really nice purpose built tool kits as well for things like bikes, motor cycles, appliance repair and so on. All in all, a very good brand, very high quality and great customer support. I'm pretty much a German tools or husky type of guy, either I'm spending a wad because I want it to be just fucking right or I could care less and just want it cheap amd easily available."
