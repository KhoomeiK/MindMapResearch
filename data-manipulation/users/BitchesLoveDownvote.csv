SteamController,ffq7ka7,t1_ffq714z,1580124654.0,"https://github.com/kozec/sc-controller/releases

Last release was december 25th, 2019.

Looking at the release notes it looks like some of the overlay menu features might have been implemented since I last tried it on Windows."
SteamController,ffq4ul9,t1_ffpvn11,1580120569.0,"There’s an open source driver/gui called SC-Controller. It started off on Linux, but recent builds support both Linux and Windows. The Windows version is not up to feature parity yet, but most basic functionality works. (Things like overlay menus, and some advanced customisation options do not work on windows yet). I have personally never used the Steam Controller through Steam, only through SC-Controlller (on Linux)."
linux_gaming,ffl4wzn,t1_ffkwq59,1580034861.0,"Yeah, in my experience I almost always get a higher FPS under linux. Linux appears to be the better platform for gaming, just needs developers to support it."
PublicFreakout,ffi4aji,t1_ffi1woz,1579964672.0,"I think it’s debatable how it might play out in America. Part of the problem in China is all the people without this virus who are seeking treatment because they are worried they might have it, and so are in hospitals alongside people who do have it and getting infected because of this. Perhaps Americans would be less likely to crowd hospitals over their sniffles due to worries about being bankrupted because of it, and that would avoid people with weakened immune systems coming into contact with the virus.

However those with the virus might also avoid a visit the the hospital over the same fears of bankruptcy, and end up spreading it in their community.

You may be right, and hospitals would still end up crowded with people with symptoms due to the hysteria drummed up by the media. With an early warning, due to seeing how it is playing out in another country and not trying to hide it, America would probably have a better chance at containing any outbreak."

worldnews,ffhonbp,t1_ffhdd36,1579945661.0,"Totally agree.

I just meant if they’re making a personal choice it’s useless *telling* them which to choose. Changing the system to incentivise the right choice, or outright banning the wrong choice, would be far more effective and efficient than trying to educate billions of people on the problem and why they should care.

Although a population which neither understands nor cares about the problem is unlikely to support the systemic changes required to solve it."
Seaofthieves,ffgmtik,t1_ffgk0n8,1579909892.0,"You can jump while doing the sword lunge without begining with the block, you just have to jump at the very end of the charging animation or else you lose all of your forward momentum."

Seaofthieves,ffgmijk,t1_ffgknth,1579909688.0,"Perhaps! I basically never employ blocking for maneuverability when lunging (which I know I should), you do only have a short window near the end of the charge to jump without cancelling all of your momentum in the lunge."

worldnews,ffexqg1,t1_ffevb7a,1579869682.0,"Thanks, I hadn’t considered the carbon emissions from the production of the can.

I definitely agree, tackling climate change is definitely more important to humanity. If we’re talking about personal choices to mitigate our negative impact on the world, though, I think it’s also much better to let people make informed choices for themselves rather than telling them which to choose. If they don’t think climate change is important I would much rather they choose to reduce their plastic consumption than do neither."

I think lightning is technically smaller (and seems more robust to me) than USB-C. Hopefully next time Apple want to go with a “better” cable, they’ll release it as an open standard for others to use. 

Considering they use USB-C on their laptops, I suspect they will go with standards if they ever change their cables again. Public demand for standard connectors is much greater now than it was when they switched to lightning."
worldnews,fei8lpg,t1_fei7yyo,1579132708.0,"So about the same, then. I remember lightning came out just before USB-C. Considering they use USB-C on their laptops, I imagine they might have gone with USB-C on their phones if it was ready. They couldn’t really change connector again so soon without upsetting their customers who just had to throw out all their fancy iPhone docks. Although, ignoring the proprietary pricing, I do prefer lightning to USB-C as a connector."
worldnews,fei7dik,t1_fei3spr,1579131926.0,"Apple rarely introduce a new connector, there have been 2 connectors used in iPhones. I think macbooks have had 2 in the same time span too, but I’ve not followed that as closely.

I can’t speak for Apple’s true intentions, but the concern that enforcing a single connector type would prevent new connectors from being used is quite real. Depends what the EU demand, though. If it’s “must be USB-C”, then we’ll never get USB-D. If it’s “must be an open, non-proprietary standard charging cable” then we might have a few different charging cables out there, but hopefully most will use the same standard."

Even if they were evil people, the majority of those with the power to oppress women were men. That’s not to say that “all men” were evil, just that the majority of people who oppressed women were men, and it was always because they were not men. When tackling those issues, it is then usually men who stand in the way. That is why when trying to tackle issues, and fighting men every step of the way, I can see it leading to misandry. I don’t believe you have to hate men if you want women to have equal rights, but I can understand why fighting for the right to be treated as an equal by men can lead to that resentment."

It sounds like you mean you want to try *new* things by cooking them yourself (which is probably a great idea, no better way to get comfortable with knowing what is going into a dish than by putting the things there yourself). You might want to try just cooking things you already find safe first, just to get more comfortable with (being seen) *cooking* before you throw in the *new* food too.

I’m now a “fair weather vegan”, which is just a vegetarian who doesn’t typically buy or consume any animal products but doesn’t quibble too much if a friend serves me dairy/egg products or a restaurant only has vegetarian options.
