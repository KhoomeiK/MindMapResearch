I'm very fortunate that my employer in Canada understood that. I lost my sister 3 days after starting there. He told me to take as much time as I needed, and asked if I was sure I wanted to come back so soon after 5 weeks. He then told me not to expect to be working with the same productivity for the next 1.5 years, and he was right.

Cats, lions, dogs, wolves, coyotes, and all sorts of predators. If they kill an animal with milk, the milk is treated as the most valuable food on that animal.

news,feu6a5m,t1_fetzxdn,1579383508.0,"> 4% of Catholic priests in the U.S. sexually victimized minors during the past half century. No evidence has been published at this time which states this number is higher than clergy from other religious traditions. The 4% figure appears lower than school teachers during the same time frame, and certainly less than offenders in the general population of men

You keep saying this, but you don't back it up well. First, you take the 4% figure as fact, which is unjustified for very obvious reasons that I already pointed out. Second, you keep saying that's less than in the general population of men, and you have provided zero data to back that up. This is why it comes across as dishonest. If you're not intentionally lying about it, you're at least being intellectually dishonest. I implore you to take a rational and objective look at your own claims.

The biggest difference between us that I see is that I'm not defending any of those groups, yet you're very defensive of the catholic church. Not only that, you use a fallacious tactic to defend them: pointing to other groups as also being guilty (though perhaps not of the worse crime of protecting those criminals). Have the courage to call out the immorality you see right in front of you without pointing to everything else first."

You need better evidence for this claim, or just admit it's not available and you don't know if priests fare better or worse than other groups. 

You did slightly better with your second link (your first one, again, didn't at all support your claim, and you should own up to that), but now you're just comparing a claim from the very organization in question to one profession in one country.

So the catholic church, an organization repeatedly shown to have hidden and protected pedophiles from justice and keep them in positions of authority,  admits to about a 4% rate.

Then the rest of the article suggests that maybe the rate of child abusers in the rest of society isn't better, **but provides absolutely zero evidence or statistics to back that up**.

How is this in any way evidence for your claim? I'm sure you can sense my frustration, but I believe it's justified. You make a big claim, I ask for evidence, you provide nothing but a red herring. It makes you look like a liar and a fraud. I hope you're at least attempting to be honest."

AskAcademia,feopgnc,t3_eq1bkn,1579303502.0,"I come from a very similar position as you, and had a similar plan as Option 1, and in my anecdotal experience, perhaps Option 1 is not as bad/risky as you might think.

A bit of background, I'm also in a subfield of ML, and my PhD supervisor was not an expert in this field. In fact, no one at my institution was an expert in the field. So we have that in common. If you're someone who's really interested in your field, like I was, and like you very clearly seem to be, and you're intelligent with a good work ethic, then I think you'll be fine. 

There are two benefits to Option 1 that you might not have considered. The first is that because you can't rely on someone else's knowledge as much, you must learn your field from the ground up. This is something I was worried about throughout my PhD. Over time, I started to see that people from labs that specialized in my field only knew some aspects of the field/application area well, because knowledge and skill was distributed throughout the lab. On the contrary, I learned to design and build systems from scratch, and I learned how to ask and explore some pretty different research questions in the field. Would you potentially get more publications in a lab that is more specialized in your topic? Maybe. But I don't think you're at much of a disadvantage as you think.

The second benefit is that you may become THE expert in that topic at your institution, or at least in your group. For me, this made me a highly sought-after collaborator. 

Since it seems you have a good and open supervisor, you'll probably find it's not as hard to collaborate with other groups as you might think, even internationally. If you're able to go to conferences and connect with some people who specialize in your field and work on some papers with them, you won't be missing out on working with other experts as much, and it'll also be really good on your CV / for your personal and professional development. 

Finally, by the end of your PhD, you might have discovered other areas of research you're also interested in. I ended up doing a postdoc in a different subarea of machine learning, and now I'm going back to something closer to my PhD, but integrating that other area of ML. Being in a highly specialized lab/group can silo people a bit, or even put blinders on them. 

There is of course some risk to being in a lab that doesn't perfectly specialize in your topic, but there's a lot of potential reward as well. I hope my experience adds some perspective for you. Also, maybe one day we'll meet at NeurIPS or CVPR, though we may never know it!"

I have data and partial results for 3 more first-authored papers from earlier experiments, in addition to the three already under review (only one of those three are first-authored though). I've also been collaborating with the lab I'm joining on a project that I think we'll submit by this coming fall. 

If I look towards the end of the year and focus on new work with the new group, it's hard to say. I expect a steeper learning curve than usual. First because they are a really top-notch internationally well-regarded group, and second because I want to learn their techniques thoroughly.

news,feu6a5m,t1_fetzxdn,1579383508.0,"> 4% of Catholic priests in the U.S. sexually victimized minors during the past half century. No evidence has been published at this time which states this number is higher than clergy from other religious traditions. The 4% figure appears lower than school teachers during the same time frame, and certainly less than offenders in the general population of men

You keep saying this, but you don't back it up well. First, you take the 4% figure as fact, which is unjustified for very obvious reasons that I already pointed out. Second, you keep saying that's less than in the general population of men, and you have provided zero data to back that up. This is why it comes across as dishonest. If you're not intentionally lying about it, you're at least being intellectually dishonest. I implore you to take a rational and objective look at your own claims.

The biggest difference between us that I see is that I'm not defending any of those groups, yet you're very defensive of the catholic church. Not only that, you use a fallacious tactic to defend them: pointing to other groups as also being guilty (though perhaps not of the worse crime of protecting those criminals).

AskAcademia,feopgnc,t3_eq1bkn,1579303502.0,"I come from a very similar position as you, and had a similar plan as Option 1, and in my anecdotal experience, perhaps Option 1 is not as bad/risky as you might think.

A bit of background, I'm also in a subfield of ML, and my PhD supervisor was not an expert in this field. In fact, no one at my institution was an expert in the field. So we have that in common. If you're someone who's really interested in your field, like I was, and like you very clearly seem to be, and you're intelligent with a good work ethic, then I think you'll be fine. 

There are two benefits to Option 1 that you might not have considered. The first is that because you can't rely on someone else's knowledge as much, you must learn your field from the ground up. This is something I was worried about throughout my PhD. Over time, I started to see that people from labs that specialized in my field only knew some aspects of the field/application area well, because knowledge and skill was distributed throughout the lab. On the contrary, I learned to design and build systems from scratch, and I learned how to ask and explore some pretty different research questions in the field. Would you potentially get more publications in a lab that is more specialized in your topic? Maybe. But I don't think you're at much of a disadvantage as you think.

The second benefit is that you may become THE expert in that topic at your institution, or at least in your group. For me, this made me a highly sought-after collaborator. 

Since it seems you have a good and open supervisor, you'll probably find it's not as hard to collaborate with other groups as you might think, even internationally. If you're able to go to conferences and connect with some people who specialize in your field and work on some papers with them, you won't be missing out on working with other experts as much, and it'll also be really good on your CV / for your personal and professional development. 

Finally, by the end of your PhD, you might have discovered other areas of research you're also interested in. I ended up doing a postdoc in a different subarea of machine learning, and now I'm going back to something closer to my PhD, but integrating that other area of ML. Being in a highly specialized lab/group can silo people a bit, or even put blinders on them. 

There is of course some risk to being in a lab that doesn't perfectly specialize in your topic, but there's a lot of potential reward as well. I hope my experience adds some perspective for you. Also, maybe one day we'll meet at NeurIPS or CVPR, though we may never know it!"

I've also been collaborating with the lab I'm joining on a project that I think we'll submit by this coming fall. 

If I look towards the end of the year and focus on new work with the new group, it's hard to say. I expect a steeper learning curve than usual. First because they are a really top-notch internationally well-regarded group, and second because I want to learn their techniques thoroughly.
