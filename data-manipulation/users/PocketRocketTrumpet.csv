relationship_advice,ffuczof,t3_ev8gj8,1580239371.0,"It was your right to kick him out of the room.
It’s now his right to not forgive you.

If he’s willing to end the marriage over this, it’s also his right to do so.

If his sole reason of not ending the marriage is because of the kid, then you have to prepare for a very tiresome relationship.

It is what it is - you made your call, he is now making his.

Whatever emotions you are going through right now, I hope you understand that postnatal emotions may allow it to spike through the roof. I can’t speak for you, but as with almost everyones’ response, you can only give it time for now. If you believe giving time makes you a sitting duck, then just simply imagine how your husband felt while he was outside after you kicked him out of the delivery room. I think if you can communicate your feelings AFTER giving it time, you can make him believe that you have went through what he may have went through. Relatability can smooth out the edges and alleviate some of the ongoing tension. 

Be prepared to also focus on the topic of dignity. He may have lost dignity when his own wife kicked him out of the delivery room in front of all the hospital staff. You have to somehow communicate to him that at the moment of labor you somehow felt you weren’t comfortable letting your husband witness the birth of his child due to vaginal ripping and shitting yourself but while every strangers working the delivery room were granted that privilege. If this wasn’t your intention, you best believe this is exactly what your husband thinks.

Top it off with a cherry by acknowledging his wonderful efforts, time, and dedication to you and the child thus far."
