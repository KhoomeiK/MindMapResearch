PedoGate,ff8fc81,t3_es2tsm,1579676037.0,"Well for me, I suspect something happened to me as a child. I COULD be wrong. For some reason, if I see any one put on lipstick, I throw up. If anyone kisses me with lipstick, I throw up. If anyone tries to put lipstick on me, I throw up. I have no idea, why I am like this. What is it with me and lipstick? I dunno. But, I do know, this is NOT normal behavior. I can’t recall, when, how, or why this started."
FanFiction,ff8ewhc,t3_es0rwp,1579675534.0,"I am writing a “Satanic” book and wrote in the beginning, it will be dark. I also warn people of what it contains beforehand, like a Satanic make up ritual, violence, etc. I recently wrote about the “antichrist” as a child that gets shot in the heart and is in the hospital, but I explained why. In Revelations 13:3 it says, “a fatal wound that will be healed.” I haven’t turned off readers, which is a surprise to me. 

My points? Maybe you can warn people beforehand like, heads up death is included in this chapter, or something like that. Come up with a good explanation of why this occurs. Maybe that will help? Just some suggestions."
FanFiction,ff3h8z8,t3_erepag,1579540987.0,"I had a negative review on one of my work on AO3. I thought it would stop people from reading my work, it didn’t. I actually left the negative review up and with my response. I wanted to tell anyone that dares to give me negative reviews that don’t help me as a writer that I am not going to feel bad or stop writing. They probably thought because I am deaf and have cerebral palsy that I would be stupid and listen. Sorry, nice try.

Until anyone invests in my work, I can either listen or ignore what you say. I am 100% control over my work and not anyone else. The freedom and the positive of the fan sites? There are plenty of stories to read from. So, if you don’t like one, move on and read another one. No one is forcing you to read anyone’s work. Today, people just don’t know how to act like adults. Sorry to rumble as you can see, I can relate."

FanFiction,fdksrjg,t1_fdkqvka,1578510389.0,"I am not sure where you got that idea from. But that is disgusting. You need to read what I said again. I said if I had a choose between THINKING about roaches and mice OR sex, which do you think that I would pick? Sex. What is wrong with my sentence that you’re not understanding, what I am saying?"
SuicideWatch,fdkoc37,t1_fdknyks,1578507751.0,"Oh, I’m sorry. I wish you had that option like I do. Yes, being depressed over debt is reasonable, when you don’t have a way to get rid of it. Even though I filed for bankruptcy, I’m honestly more depressed about my stupid and idiotic decision of living where I do. It has roaches and mice. I have lived in different apartments under Section 8 for 15 years, never this bad. There has been days I struggled with just getting out of bed and to just eat something. I hope things get better for you in some way."

In my defense, I had 2 choices. To think about sex or think about this apartment that has mice and roaches that causes me to be depressed. You can figure out which one I choose lol"

No car, house, or job. I am $9,000 in debt between credit cards and hospital bills. Yes, 10 years of bad credit, but what can you do?"
