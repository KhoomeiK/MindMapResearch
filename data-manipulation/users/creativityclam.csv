Definitely explore all parts of the island. I went to Oahu and rented a car and traveled throughout the whole island so I could the â€œless tourist-yâ€ areas.  If you plan to go to Oahu go to north shore and west shore.

I liked Oahu because itâ€™s a good mix of nature exploration and partying. For me, vacations with a mix of both are a lot of fun."
