Online is fun as hell and the matches can go on for like a half hour. Best part, head over to $5 Below and you can pick up a copy of it for $5 on either PS4 or XBone. It got shelved because it came out the same time as Overwatch, but I believe it is a much better game, and can take an hour just to find a match now. Thankfully r/battleborn is always trying to resurrect this title."
