Competitiveoverwatch,ffv7avm,t1_ffuh6w9,1580257387.0,"I personally think from a balance standpoint its better if they push their fixes for the current problems out all at once. which would allow for the meta to settle better as a result. If they keep pushing out attempted fixes to some problems but not all they will become prone to having this revolving balance issue. Instead of saying, alright this is gonna be the meta for a month lets see how it settles and going from there.

just my 2 cents"
bindingofisaac,fftmti7,t1_ffsbved,1580224534.0,"No because like I said the game was not that  interesting to me. I played the original for 2 weeks then lost all interest, there just wasn't enough depth for me personally, at least on release, i don't know if that changed. Apparently a few people are very defensive of the game. Sure it was fun for a while, but i was not the only one with in these opinions on the original RoR, and I stand by it, just because you some people enjoyed the game I don't think you can call the original a master piece by a long shot."
Showerthoughts,ffrwf00,t3_eup2cw,1580167393.0,"I always wonder how much these statistics will change by the end of our lifetime. The social structure of society has changed so severely in the last 40 or so years.

Like yeah of course guys died earlier in the 50s when everyone smoked over a pack a day and men were the sole bread winners in the house taking on absurd amounts of stress, and there were abysmal safety regulations in the work place. 

It be interesting to see how that would hold up against say the generation born in the next 20 years."
leagueoflegends,ffqzvdp,t1_ffqyinj,1580147368.0,or lets not forget his ult. last night i got completely one shot as sona by 4th shot from ult for 1300 damage. true skill.
bindingofisaac,ffqu1j7,t1_ffqhqqh,1580143635.0,"lets be honest. idk if anyone was calling the first risk of rain a master piece. The game, while fun for a short while, had glaring flaws and a relevancy period of about a week. It had an extremely repetitive game loop, uninteresting item variance, and after an hour of grinding basically turned into ok your new run record is as long as you can stand one shotting all these enemies for the next dew hours. Risk of Rain 2 did a great job of taking the concept and making it something people actually wanted to play."

apexuniversity,fffqtui,t3_et6pnb,1579889805.0,"I find that theoretically yes there is always a way out, but it boils down to how far ahead you are thinking and analyzing the information you have, and how accurate your predictions are.

You rarely actually have a situation irl where someone has 20 hostages holed up in a building like a bank or something. Most the time its someone being heavily physically abused by one person and if they can manage to get a call out without the aggressor knowing you can bet your ass they aren't going to get a second chance to call. And i get your frustration at the scenario. But in the event you personally are suffering from an actual terrible life threatening event.

Overwatch,fdxs528,t1_fdxcw4h,1578772372.0,"I think a part of it it too is that a main factor in ranking up is consistancy and that tends to get overlooked slightly. people seem to think a gold or lower player can only fluctuate down in skill, when in reality a gold dps player for example, probably has out of a 10 game sample, something along the lines of 3 games they performed sub par, 4 games they performed average for their skill and 3 games where they carried. When you judge people only on a game by game basis and assume they play like that every game ya you are gonna call someone a smurf.

For one thing its not upside down.

But in all seriousness I think this is a picture of someone testing out their new snow making system and taking pictures or video. And they might be trying to see how fast they could cover that building in snow.

Being from California and being pretty close to a lot of these big fires over the years there are a couple things that lead me to believe this:

1. The big one is that the foliage is too green for a severe drought like they are experiencing. Here everything's dead as can be long before its bad enough to catch sporadically.

2. Its not quite smokey/Hazy enough for the fires to be that close to this location. I lived 90 miles from a wild fire not even close to the size as Australias but still hefty, and it literally rained ash for a week at its peak.

RocketLeagueExchange,fdo48bh,t1_fdnz9nt,1578598601.0,"I never said they were, and that's my point, you are forgetting what actually put them up in price to begin with. they were never actually up in price because they were actually rare, except for maybe the first month they were released. They went up in price originally because it was hands down the best white wheel option at the time, and the way people in these kind of trading communities work, once the price has been set, people aren't gonna just start selling their item for less when people want it. supply and demand works two ways, this wasnt a supply (rarity) issue it was a demand issue. while there a lot of them out there far more people wanted them at the time, this means price goes up.

My point is all of you even acting like rarity had a major part to play with these wheels are straight trippin and do not actually remember why they became popular in the first place.

So i hate to be the one to break it to you, but being condescending without actually understanding what you are replying to isnt a good shade on you."
RocketLeagueExchange,fdnxwln,t1_fdnc8wg,1578595085.0,you're forgetting the main reason they became popular in the first place.
