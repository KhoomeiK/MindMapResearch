bodyweightfitness,fff3is8,t3_et2vgx,1579874732.0,"I'd suggest the first couple of times he goes with you, the two of you walk around the gym together and let him get an idea of where everything is so he doesn't feel completely lost. Have him try out the machines that look interesting and explain to him what each machine works and what it does. I'd keep it low key and interesting, encouraging him to try out different machines and perhaps throwing in a bit of free weights and some cardio as well, even if it's just walking on the treadmill at a slow pace for 5 or 10 minutes. Once he's comfortable, then the two of you can figure out a routine that works for him based on his goals. Most importantly though is to be supportive and make sure he learns proper technique for whatever he does. Nothing dampens and discourages a person from working out more than doing something wrong, too fast, or with too much weight and getting hurt as a result."
AskDocs,fff0x5e,t3_esy19y,1579872626.0,"I'm all for vaccinating children, but I understand your wife's worries about not wanting her child to go through what she did. Talk to the pediatrician about a delayed vaccine schedule, it's not ideal in my opinion, but it may be a way for your child to start the vaccines on time and just have them spaced out more."

Pets,ff955jo,t3_es96xp,1579705086.0,"One poster suggested working with the son to teach the cat tricks. I'd also suggest working with the son to teach him basic manners towards the cat. Not sure how old the son is but teaching him the basics of how to pet a cat properly, how to recognize cues that the cat doesn't want to be bothered and leaving him alone, and encouraging him not to pick up the cat if he doesn't like it and how to properly hold the cat if he does pick him up would go a long way in making the cat comfortable around the son and also give you the opportunity to hang out with the cat. 

The cat goes to you because you treat him properly and he feels safe around you, until he feels that way around the kid and your room mate then you will mostly be your go to person."
cats,ff7s75w,t3_es4p2u,1579657074.0,There is a subreddit on here called askvets. I'd definitely post there if you haven't done so yet. I'd also suggest a second opinion from a different vet office if you disagree with the first diagnosis.
MomForAMinute,feo3srv,t3_eq5sef,1579294705.0,"So proud of you! It sounds like you are doing a great job, keep it up!"
Pets,fejuhea,t3_epav98,1579186132.0,"IMO it's time to let him go. He's incontinent, he can barely get away from his own waste when he does go,  it's sounds like, and I may be wrong, that he spends most of his days lying in the same place unless you move him. Sounds like this poor pup's quality of life is not good at all and the bad times are outweighing the good, when these sorts of things start happening then it's time to let him go. It's hard, and no one wants to have to do that, but as a responsible pet owner it's a decision you have to make, to let our pets go and do our best to minimize their pain and suffering.  Also oncology appointments aren't cheap and you said yourself that you couldn't afford anymore expensive vet trips, so how's that going to work?  I understand wanting to keep your pet but you have to consider their quality of life and if they are truly happy  right now."
SeriousConversation,fejpsjm,t3_epfh98,1579182723.0,"I am not a doctor but I do want to suggest that you look into something call  Essential Tremor. One of my good friends started having problems with her balance, trembling, coordination etc. Granted she is much older than you, late 40's but it's worth a shot, getting it checked out.  I think once you can get a diagnosis and get some sort of treatment plan then figuring out how to cope with it will be easier.   [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/essential-tremor/symptoms-causes/syc-20350534](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/essential-tremor/symptoms-causes/syc-20350534) 

It does sound like you are having to fight the healthcare system and I'm sorry to hear about that.  It would be a bit of work but if you can, or if you have anyone that can help you gather all your medical records, see if there are any doctors in other areas of Australia that would at least be willing to review your records and offer consultation, it may be a long shot but maybe going outside your local area could give you different options for diagnosis. Just a thought.  Good Luck!"
cats,fean4ui,t3_eo7ydp,1578950468.0,She's beautiful  and your co workers are cat hating idiots.
Pets,fe8ct48,t3_eo256w,1578924841.0,"Thank you for adopting a senior cat! They are so often overlooked and forgotten about so it's nice to hear that you are considering one. 

When getting a cat tree make sure it's very sturdy and has a wide base to help stop it from toppling when the cat jumps on/off it.  As far as securing objects to prevent toppling, if you think it's going to be a issue you can try velcro strips, put one piece on the bottom of the object and the other piece on the surface of the desk, counter etc and secure it. 

I'd feed the cat in the morning before you leave for work, speak with your vet about the best kind of food to feed a senior cat, and then again in the evening before you settle down for the night. Some people will leave out a bit of dry food for their cat to nibble on throughout the day. 

Prepare for a bit of hissing and growling as the two cats see each other, if it becomes too much you may have to put a screen or something up to block their view of each other, some cats don't care about other cats being nearby, others can't stand it."
Pets,fdrx4gh,t3_ems2x9,1578691037.0,"Patience. All she's known up until you adopted her was a house full of dogs, dog smells, dog noises, and not feeling safe. To me it sounds like you are doing all the right things so keep at it. She has to re learn how to be a cat and eventually she'll understand that there's no dogs and that you're there to be her friend. 

Keep her hiding spot just like it is. Keep a few toys lying around, and when you can, play with the wand toys when she's nearby, even if it's just slowly flicking them around to catch her attention, not necessarily play directly with her but at her so she can see the toys in action and get her curiosity up.  I'd put a t shirt down with your scent on it so she can continue to get used to your smell when you aren't around.  Maybe put it under few treats that you've left on the floor so she can associate your smell with tasty food? 

If you can, get her a tall, sturdy scratching post with a platform on it and stick it near a window if possible so she can have a fun place to hang out. 

I think she'll get there, it's just going to take some extra time."
Pets,fdnz7rt,t3_em9ne9,1578595842.0,"As everyone else has said, vet for checkup( tell them she's a stray  and you plan on keeping her inside) microchip and register her, shots, flea treatment and a deworming. Get a litter box, litter, good quality food(opinions of what constitutes good quality is different, I always say buy the best quality food you can comfortably afford) a couple of bowls, a few different cat toys, and a soft blanket that she can have as her own and put it in a quiet spot. If it's been a month and a half chances are no one is going to claim her, she was most likely abandoned, so congrats you have now been chosen to be this cat's human!"

Pets,fdkzgjw,t3_elt3c4,1578514333.0,"When you walk by a room and see a curtain rod suspiciously lower on one end than the other. Hmmm...then upon closer inspection, the screws are pulling out of the drywall, probably because my little fuzzbutt named Joey thought at some point and time it would be great fun to run full speed and JUMP as high as possible onto the curtains and sit on the rod, repeatedly, while no one was home."
cats,fdh2bzb,t3_el4isl,1578413864.0,"I'm sorry you are facing this tough situation. You've given her 17 wonderful and love filled years and I believe without a doubt that she'll be in heaven living a wonderful life without any sort of sickness or pain, and when you get there she'll be right there to greet you and show you everything she's been doing in heaven."

cats,fci7096,t3_ehcjbt,1577658484.0,"He may not like the litter. If he was an outside kitten then the gravel like litter is something different than he is used to. See if you can find something finer that would more closely resemble sand or soil and start with a litter box of  that, if he uses that then slowly replace it with your choice of litter. You can also find some of his droppings and place them in the litter box to see if that will help attract him to the box. Make sure it's in a quiet out of the way place where he isn't on display when he's doing his business. I believe you can also buy litter that is supposed to attract cats to the box."
cats,fci2zsk,t3_ehc3jx,1577657138.0,"Sometimes when a cat is sick or in pain their behavior changes. I'd take him to the vet to rule out anything like that. Has his environment changed in any way? New food or litter? Had anything happened that would cause him to be more stressed? Are there other animals he could see/hear outside that could be getting him agitated? You can buy Feliway plugs to put in your apartment from most pet stores or online from Amazon. Look up Jackson Galaxy and see if you can find any advice online from him that may help.

I've already tried the chocolate and coffee and both taste wonderful. The pen and stand I've used a wee bit, but plan on working more with them after the holiday. Thank you SS, I love my presents!"
