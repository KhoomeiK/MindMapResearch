starbucks,ffh6gj5,t1_ffh1v7i,1579924431.0,Can't make them think you're people with people needs.
starbucksbaristas,ffh5wo9,t1_ffg3vdk,1579923990.0,Sounds like a risky move. What if you spill while trying to pump vanilla into the full cup? You might burn your hand!
starbucksbaristas,ff881gw,t1_ff86t3c,1579668672.0,"I upvoted you, but I'm sorely tempted to downvote you because my god, that fairy."
starbucks,ff52ok3,t1_ff36p4l,1579578585.0,"The store I go to, the ice machine is in the lobby and one day one of the baristas was just scooping out the ice non-stop. Apparently a customer stuck their hand into the machine for some reason and they had to get the ice out so they could clean the machine."
starbucksbaristas,ff52338,t1_ff4tqob,1579578131.0,Don't you guys have giant pictures of the lattes for your menu board? You can see that it doesn't have whip on top.
starbucks,fewwhgk,t1_few3o1i,1579420565.0,A barista at my usual store recommended steamed cold brew. She said she was messing around and ended up liking it. I haven't the courage to try it yet.
starbucks,fepdk74,t3_eq7pl5,1579317870.0,"Oh, I was hoping for a puppy waiting for a puppuccino. Congrats on your new beautiful oven, though."
starbucksbaristas,fepd7iq,t1_fepa6x8,1579317631.0,But do you really want the details of her STDs?

starbucksbaristas,fefppdc,t3_eorbi9,1579061717.0,"I think ""thank you"" would be weird but ""good/great/excellent/awesome/other positive adjectives job today"" for working hard is warranted."
starbucks,febm97d,t1_fearnjm,1578960308.0,"And some places do small, regular and large; while other places do regular, medium and large. But I have been that customer before, saying regular when I meant medium."
aww,fe0db7k,t3_enfkv1,1578810639.0,"I thought the title said ""cute CAT taking a bath"" and thought it was a rare water-loving feline. I'm glad I clicked on it nonetheless."
starbucksbaristas,fe0bgtt,t1_fdtcp4v,1578808698.0,"After reading what other baristas said, rather than being a poor thing, I think I'm rather lucky I haven't had to experience that. :P"
starbucksbaristas,fe0bf2n,t1_fdtt7a1,1578808652.0,"Ooh, thank you for your explanation."
starbucksbaristas,fe0bea4,t1_fdu3zwc,1578808630.0,Ooh. Thank you for your explanation.
starbucksbaristas,fdtbvay,t1_fdt1t2f,1578714558.0,"Why, is it harder to open?"
starbucksbaristas,fdtbpgm,t1_fdt3oxa,1578714497.0,The Starbucks I go to closes at 7PM.
starbucks,fdt9zqi,t1_fdsmp8w,1578713860.0,"Oof, that'd be terrible. The rinser is right next to the condiment bar at the starbucks I frequent."
nosleep,fdi4psj,t1_fblzyid,1578435696.0,">“It's a recent injury. Caused by the Sentinels, as you call them. \[ \]""

dogswithjobs,fcyrizp,t1_fcxas8c,1578085563.0,Is that a scene in that movie? I haven't yet watched it.
dogswithjobs,fcwukk5,t1_fcvdp9r,1578038232.0,Reminds me of when my pet chicken started standing on my foot. I figured he started doing that because I can't step on him if he's stepping on me.

starbucksbaristas,fcjngq7,t1_fcj51d3,1577695201.0,"I don't know... if I block someone on everything, I'd rather they move on instead of trying to figure out where I work so that they can talk to me in person. Even if it was just to apologize rather than confront me."
starbucksbaristas,fc71cgn,t1_fc70frv,1577494912.0,Always a silver lining. :)
