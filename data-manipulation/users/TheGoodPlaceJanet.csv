I see some entitled socially awkward guys of different body types and heights getting dates from the apps and actually meeting people they like.

IDK, it's also too late for me to go the red pill route and develop pick up game. What women want is just not me. And it fucking sucks...being alone everywhere sucks. My friends are all wondering why I'm single...and soon it's gonna make me a creep.

It happens in [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) too. Dance classes. Book clubs. Everything with a social element to it, is no longer social. At least in my city (Toronto), but I doubt location has much to do with this."
MensLib,fffhpf0,t1_ffd93kk,1579884202.0,"Social media is not designed for us to socialize, it is designed for us to perform. Rise of Snapchat sealed this: give me your 15 seconds of fame, not interested in anything else beyond that. If you want to connect by just 15 sec of content, well, that's a performance not an attempt to open up to the world and connect. Same way actors present themselves in movies. People love Tom Hanks but rarely have interacted with him in-person.

The tools social media platforms give you are also aligned with this. It's never ""this person spent 10 minutes reading what you wrote"" or ""hey these few people are always looking forward to your updates"" or metrics like that. It's likes/impressions/views. Naturally we wanna get more of those, which again means we perform on social media, we won't socialize."
MensLib,fffh9d5,t1_ffd8til,1579883922.0,">The question is what really is it that makes people retreat into silos and reject others?

Popularity. With things like IG/Tinder, you can obtain a virtual level of popularity, that creates this sense of busyness, that you don't have time for in-person relationships, because you need to perform for your IG/Tinder audience to maintain that level of popularity. Much of this popularity comes with status, of course. And it's getting increasingly difficult to upgrade your status."

>The anonymous graphs can’t be fact-checked, but they provide immediate  relief for men who feel entirely alone in their inability to find a  partner. By blaming Tinder, women and biology, **individuals are absolved  from responsibility**; turning the conversation to anger and retaliation.

>“\[This  trend\] is definitely something that attracts the incel community. A lot  of the data posted is also noticeably skewed towards people who find  success more rarely than the average person, so it confirms their biases  and probably helps ease their anxieties,” says Andrew.

   What an ironic statement by Andrew, the founder of /r/TinderData. There is /r/Tinder already for those who have ""good"" success rate on the apps.

I wonder what Andrew's ""performance"" has been on Tinder. Funny story: at our annual company gathering, the sales & analytics team presented a graph about how the company's platform makes money in 1 out of a billion incoming requests. The presenter, a handsome white man in his 20s with a high paying job in a field that is not male dominated, jokingly compared this with his dating app performance. He got a big laugh out of the crowd.
