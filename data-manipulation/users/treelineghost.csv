Visualize a peaceful strong attitude as you are making your way through all of the people and their energy.  Then it's all about mindfulness.  You continue the mindset you had in meditation as you are going through the experience of travel.   Tests like this actually make you stronger, but don't expect to be perfect the first time.  Hold it as long as you can and then build on that and try and keep that mindset longer and longer each time.  Eventually, if you keep at it, that will become your default."

In other words, it's a trade off.  You suffer as you do the work but you are making yourself better in the long run.  I do agree with you, however, that it is good to seek as much knowledge as you can.  For me, energy work is one part of a greater spiritual/supernatural journey.  Exploring meditation and prayer came first for me, and everything that I do, I do in pursuit of my relationship with God, so I don't feel afraid.

energy_work,ffife5z,t3_etsvnp,1579972556.0,"In my experience you don't ""move"" energy.  You redirect your perception and as you focus on a new area, you raise the vibration in that area.  As for different areas producing responses in other areas of the body, don't think of it as energy that can be moved.  The energetic body runs along planes.  When you activate or spin up one area, you will activate and spin up other energy centers on the same plane (there are many many energy centers, not just the main chakras).  When you do this, you inevitably encounter blockages in other areas on the same plane.  That might feel like a slight popping sensation, a rush of warmth or just an unpleasant tightness. There is no getting around this.  You will learn to use this to your advantage."
