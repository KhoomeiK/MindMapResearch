Fuck no.

And falsely convincing your kid that they are ""good"" is hardly doing them any favors."

Bladesmith,fe4m6vu,t1_fe49din,1578860779.0,"Then you should know that horseshoes don't normally contain enough carbon to be able to harden into a edge-holding blade.
At best it will harden to somewhere around 40-45 HRC and the very minimum for any kind of edge retention is 50+.

With that said, it still looks great and makes for good forging practice."
