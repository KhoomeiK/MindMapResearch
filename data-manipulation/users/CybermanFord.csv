shittyHDR,ffmxiij,t1_ffkp384,1580059917.0,"Over-processed could mean many things. In terms of HDR, it would be things like the halo effect, sharpness turned all the way up, the detail and clarity is extremely high, etc. This photo isn’t bad HDR, just a bad photo, that may have been taken on purpose."
shittyHDR,ffk9p30,t1_ffk6pu7,1580019248.0,"I did, and it specifically says that the sub is for shitty HDR, not shitty pictures."
shittyHDR,ffk6kbl,t1_ffk5txe,1580017535.0,"“This is shittyHDR, not shitty pictures!“ This isn’t shitty high dynamic range at all, just an image with saturation turned all the way up."

BoomerCringe,ffiqawv,t3_etc9yu,1579980050.0,"I tried looking this up and couldn’t find any law or whatever that confirms this claim, just a whole bunch of copy-pastas by ultra-conservative websites. However, if these laws DO exist, it would make sense. First off, the bald eagle is the national animal after all, of course we’d go to great lengths to protect it. Also, bald eagles used to have a huge population problem if my research proves me correct. Also, sea turtles also will face problems from pollution, climate change, etc. No shit we’d want to preserve their species, which obviously comes from the sea. Bet in a few decades it’s gonna go extinct, I wouldn’t be surprised. Humans are getting overpopulated as shit, and are the ones destroying the climate in the first place. We basically need some help hindering overpopulation at this point."

HelluvaBoss,ffdlue8,t3_est1qm,1579823625.0,Looks pretty accurate.
PublicFreakout,ffddnw6,t1_ffd7fjg,1579818689.0,You obviously misinterpreted what they said.
HazbinHotel,ffbud14,t1_ffbq9m0,1579783049.0,Your loss.
CapitalismVSocialism,ffb2k5b,t3_erjx8t,1579750184.0,"r/lostredditors. This has nothing to do with economics at all. And also, Google is a shit-show of a company and a search engine, anyways."
CapitalismVSocialism,ffb218y,t3_ersfhh,1579749815.0,"You seem to confuse Socialism with Communism. 

Also, that “definition” is incorrect. Communism is an economic system that advocates for common ownership over the means of production, and is stateless, moneyless, absent of social classes, etc."
CapitalismVSocialism,ffb1mp3,t1_ffasrzf,1579749539.0,"You obviously watched too much Fox News. Please enlighten us, tell us what is so bad about Socialism, other than the alarmist conspiracy theories you seem to have. Do you even know what Socialism is?"
CapitalismVSocialism,ffb0uia,t3_es1ptq,1579749011.0,"Sometimes, yes. Being poor or rich doesn’t necessarily dictate whether you’ll be a good person or not. It depends on the individual."
CapitalismVSocialism,ffb0n1o,t1_ff9uyrv,1579748870.0,"Market Socialism is just Socialism, but in the framework of a market economy. Like u/LanaDelHeeey said, Socialism is where the workers own the means of production, equally and publicly. Germany is far from socialist."
CapitalismVSocialism,ffb0gfw,t3_esgql4,1579748746.0,"What you are describing is more of a Social Democracy than actual Socialism.

Germany is capitalist, with social policies thrown in."
CapitalismVSocialism,ffb08lv,t3_esf2jy,1579748599.0,"Marxist Socialism and Socialism are two different things, though similar. Marxism is more of, the how a socialist society is developed. Marx’s ideas were more socioeconomic than economic. Socialism is a whole economic system in which the means of production are owned equally and publicly/collectively.  Marxism is the idea of a proletarian revolution to achieve a socialist society, and the idea of equal share of profit between the workers. You don’t necessarily have to agree with Marx’s ideology in order to be a supporter of Socialism."
CapitalismVSocialism,ffazn1z,t1_ffaurf3,1579748194.0,"Yet, you failed to provide any reason why that makes National Socialism a left-wing movement. You can still cause mass genocide and be on the far-left on the spectrum. The Nazi’s were extremely right-wing in their beliefs, as their entire belief system was on the doctrine of Nazism, and racism.

Bolshevism is a leftist ideology advocating for the violent abolishment of capitalism, and was used as a political party in the Soviet Union. It doesn’t matter what the system was used for, but what the system itself advocates."
CapitalismVSocialism,ffaugcd,t1_ffatxhv,1579744754.0,That sounds like a whole ass lie that you made up. Do you even know what Bolshevism is?
