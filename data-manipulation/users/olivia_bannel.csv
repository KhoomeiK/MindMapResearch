TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ffrbor5,t1_ffqw4jf,1580154719.0,"I am loving similar online options for other things such as birth control, though!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ffqsd8z,t3_euplqd,1580142536.0,"The only problem I could see with this is the type of antibiotic they are prescribing. The last time I went in for a UTI, they prescribed me an antibiotic to get me started until the lab results got back. Turns out the original antibiotic wouldn’t do anything for the infection and the only reason they knew this was because of the lab result which you don’t get to do online. 

Still a great resource but with antibiotic resistance on the rise I would be wary of using this unless you know what bacteria is causing it"
worldnews,ffcv8od,t3_essj4i,1579807963.0,So how worried should I be here in the US (without having done any traveling)?
StudentNurse,ffcprb6,t3_esv06g,1579804626.0,I have my first of 7 on Monday!
ringworm,ffan9yp,t3_es51av,1579739949.0,"I never got around to trying white vinegar because it was actually the apple cider vinegar that worked best for me! But like you, the creams and whatnot didn’t work for me"
AskReddit,fevjdvq,t1_fev14th,1579398110.0,Okay I get the impending doom feeling sometimes but how does one distinguish between this and anxiety that gives a feeling of doom?
NoStupidQuestions,fep07xl,t1_feozob2,1579309225.0,Usually I see it used in say a TIFU or other stories where people will be talking about the past then say “flash forward to today”
mildlyinteresting,fel97lk,t1_fel7g22,1579216811.0,US actually! I’d never seen them before my spring semester last year. I’m actually surprised they aren’t the same company; they’re so similar!
mildlyinteresting,fel3u9e,t1_fekofm8,1579213473.0,"I think this might be the same brand I see popping up around my university that makes “wide awake” chocolate bars. One bar has ~100mg of caffeine or so. Other than the chocolate, I’ve never seen them around either. Make sense they’d also make coffee though. And then I found $5..."

fatlogic,fdqlx4k,t1_fdql0cv,1578669804.0,"I completely agree and I think I should have used one of the replies that was more fatlogic-y than this. 

I don’t know if she feels she’s trying to educate people but I don’t think this is the way to go about it. I agree that she should just focus on helping the people that come to her willing to change instead of trying change unwilling minds. Once people see how she was on Biggest Loser it would be hard to trust that she is preaching something in their best interest. Although, as all of us know on this sub, it can be hard to just sit back when everyone is praising and glorifying being overweight and unhealthy. 

Other comments were saying that since Lizzo can do multiple shows a week and play the flute she must be healthy because she hardly gets out of breath and they wouldn’t be able to do all of that at a smaller size."
fatlogic,fdqkvog,t1_fdqjfer,1578669118.0,"I feel that way too. It’s too bad that people think a reality show is the end all be all on losing weight and that you have to go to the extremes to be healthy. They see the contestants getting injured because they get rushed into the exercise too quickly and do too much at once. This means all exercise must be bad if they are getting injured!

fatlogic,fdq95qu,t3_emqdcr,1578659887.0,"Although the show might have been a little extreme, Jillian isn’t wrong about the diabetes part. The other comments are all saying how she’s fatphobic and doesn’t have any issues because she’s the ideal beauty standard."

I’ve definitely met a black Dimitri before. Friends and family may not be able to understand how much this person meant/means to you and what you name your child has nothing to do with them.  They don’t have to like it."
AskReddit,fdfjpos,t3_ekvj2i,1578363306.0,If it turns too political. Peaky Blinders has some politics throughout but on the latest season they clearly had a “Trump” character talking about “false news.” I just feel like there’s no need for it no matter which way I lean
Whatcouldgowrong,fdf1j07,t1_fdejfsz,1578351197.0,"Yes...That’s what I meant by “shit happens and dogs get loose sometimes.” Trust me, I know, I have dogs myself. 

The main point of that sentence was that there’s no reason to be walking a dog without a leash, especially crossing a 4 lane, icy road."
Whatcouldgowrong,fdegepo,t3_ekwg9x,1578338460.0,A dog ran out in front of me a few weeks ago and I hit it. Didn’t kill it but man did i feel bad having to listen to it crying and writhing around on the road.  Shit happens and dogs get loose every once in a while but walking them unleashed is just terrible and there’s no excuse. There’s no reason someone should have to accidentally kill someone’s pet just because the owners can’t be responsible
LifeProTips,fddnwct,t3_ekshtf,1578319057.0,"I’m currently in nursing school so I was looking to find comparable, maybe supplemental courses that would help. I noticed the “pharmacology” class is from 2006. Is that too old to be relevant to what I’ll be learning in my school this semester?"
IAmA,fdceov8,t3_ekdnfg,1578273060.0,Have you heard of Dr. William Husel from Mount Carmel West in Ohio? I’m a nursing student and the first thing we were taught is to advocate for our patients which means double or even triple checking on the prescription orders from Drs. How much trouble do you think his nurses will in because of this?

StudentNurse,fczyb19,t3_ejlhc8,1578110721.0,I wish my university did maternal the first semester! I have to wait until senior year and it’s the one I’m most interested in at this point
toastme,fco15h6,t3_ei4aw2,1577822210.0,"Congratulations on 15! You’re going to make it 16!  I wish my uncle would take this step in his life but for now I’m going to cheer you on. Once some of the withdrawal subsides, it’s going to feel great to wake up sober every day. It’s so worth it. Do you have any hobbies to keep you busy and thinking about other things?"
AskReddit,fcnlr8q,t3_ehxmpw,1577813926.0,Not mine but remember the guy who collected staples or maybe paper clips and his family thought he had a drug addiction because of the money and time he was spending away from home?
