ABoringDystopia,ffih6zu,t3_etotqy,1579973788.0,"I'm a Firefighter/Paramedic and the cost of the ambulance transport is a major factor for some people who really need an ambulance. We also have plenty of people who treat us like an express lane to the hospital and a free taxi. 

Billing people for the transport is a major source of revenue and we wouldn't be able to afford having ambulances or paramedics without billing for it. 

I really want universal healthcare because I hate people delaying care or getting a free transport when they have no intention of paying. 

I've literally had people try to sleep off a stroke because they wanted to make sure the ambulance bill would be worth it."

AskReddit,ff8ico2,t3_es6xp4,1579679832.0,"I apologized to a dead guy for stepping on his foot.

One time I asked a mannequin if it was okay. The guys still give me shit about that one. 

I was doing CPR on a really fat guy in a cramped little bathroom and I had to step over him, but my boot got caught under his belly and I fell right on top of a fat naked dude and I had to crawl off of him.

This doctor was yelling at us because he thought the King airway we used was an ET tube and was freaking out because it was in the esophagus(where it's supposed to be) so he said he was gonna show us how to really save someone and he uses a scalpel to perform a crichothyrotomy but he fucks up and slices the guys carotid artery wide open. 

I had this guy on bath salts unbuckle himself from the gurney and he tried to jump out the back door of the ambulance as we were flying down the road. I basically had to body slam him back onto the gurney. Between that and kicking me in the chest we decided we should probably tie him down.  

I didn't feel like sharing any of the real depressing stories."

Trump does seem to be bending over backwards to help Saudi Arabia and start a war with Iran. I would be surprised if Iran did not keep a small arsenal of nuclear weapons. But even still, Iran would be a real enemy to fight. Trump has ignored his advisors before and as commander in chief he's a loose cannon. They could receive help from Pakistan or even Russia.
