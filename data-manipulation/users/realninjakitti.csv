America used to have a contract with China accepting plastic, however that is no longer in effect. Now tons of recyclables sit in warehouses, with no place to go, piling up, every single day. It sounds horrifying to say it, and will likely be an unpopular opinion, but we need a solution to remove the plastic from our planet and Stop producing it. When I propose this, I'm not proposing ejection into our atmosphere, either, more like a long ride to the sun or Venus. Yes, I'm aware there are logistical and financial issues with this proposal but the alternative is we continue to fill our Earth with plastics that never go away and eventually fish have no where to live and WE are eating plastic every time we eat seafood."
