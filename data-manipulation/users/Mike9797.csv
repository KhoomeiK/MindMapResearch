survivor,ffiz0wg,t1_ffivxg2,1579986223.0,"Hey no worries, you kind of justify my thought of it as well. It’s like when you ask and people give you a hard no about it as if you’re weird for saying it when it’s all you can see. My wife when I mentioned it said something like “ya I can sorta see it” but in a way that was just appeasing me more so than actually agreeing. And I’m like “how tf can you not totally see what I’m seeing”?!"

AskReddit,ffiph3p,t1_ffhp0js,1579979469.0,This is part of the reason I have a hard time with Curb Your Enthusiasm. A lot of the episodes would be over fast if they just took the time to listen to Larry or fix the confusion that lead to the problem in a simple conversation.

Sega_Heroes,ff75uc8,t1_ff74jkp,1579641716.0,That is basically my team instead I use Shenhua instead of Tails as I think she’s the superior healer. My mistake when I hit the wall was trying to focus on unlocking all the players instead of focusing on farming shards for characters I wanted. So in some way I feel I’m a little behind. For what I focus on now is the hero shards for legendary events and players that I will make my final team. Don’t waste your diamonds trying to keep up with the adventure events and the like. Others say to use them on node refreshes but I prefer to save them and buy the bulk shard packs like they have now for Curien and Rogen. I feel it would cost more diamonds to get 100 shards of each of those characters than to keep refreshing nodes and heck Agent G is a great legendary to get because you can easily farm him in the survival shop. I could easily have him at 3 blue star but I’m maining sonic instead.

hockey,fekxfbx,t1_fek4xj3,1579209594.0,"Exactly, I made a similar point(although it was pointed and crass so I expect to be downvoted and told off but whatever) that people hear this stuff and add their own context and trauma from their own experiences to things like this to make their own outrage on the subject even worse. The outrage in some of the comments was almost as if they’re hearing stories that Carcillo was telling us all(his were a bit much and people had a right to be outraged by them). But this is far from that. And while everyone is going to start harping on the point that a coach was involved and that he was an adult that should know better I feel it’s a weak argument. If said adult was in the process of the prank you would assume he does in fact know that it’s pretty harmless and in good fun. Yes we all know things could go sour in every prank pulled but it didn’t happen so why complain and bring up that point? Again it’s just outrage for the sake of outrage due to the events that happened with coaches earlier in the season. Yes it’s bad optics at this time and in that point he should know better than to say things now but this “incident” should not conjure outrage."
hockey,fekwp8v,t1_fek53vk,1579209165.0,He may have but everyone else will suffer for him. Don’t worry. It’s everyone’s favourite pastime lately. Getting mad at things others do but not to them directly. Also don’t add any context because they don’t like context. They just want to be outraged and make their own context to the stories so that way it feeds the anger and outrage more.

YouShouldKnow,fdxlyia,t1_fdxl0tc,1578770422.0,"Well you could do something about it by stop coming in here. The less people on the site gives them less people to reach out to and in turn less influence. There’s other ways to pass your time online and this site doesn’t have to be one of them. Now I don’t want this to sound like I’m pointing the finger solely at you because you’re just one person or millions on here but you get the drift. Nothing is going to stop people from believing in what they see as true even if it’s false. We have seen this time and time again with politics and racism. If they’re already susceptible to believing bullshit then nothing will change that. All you can do is mitigate what you see as harmful and wrong opinions by just removing yourself from the equation. The less nonsense you see the less bothered you are by it all.

I resigned to the fact I wouldn’t open any of the heavy hitters and was just looking for some Chamy shards so I can hit up the right path but unlocked Silver instead. It’s sort of bittersweet cuz I could really use the Tails shards but unlocking Silver already puts him on my B team due to his high level.

Now I don’t want to make it seem like carter was just a one homer guy because in actuality he had a few great seasons and was one of our cornerstones for those years. But I just don’t think he was dominant enough for a long enough time to make the hall. But he was good for 30/100 for a few seasons there."

leafs,fdilqzq,t1_fdif6rb,1578445729.0,Fair enough and really it’s why I said it’s to each their own. Personally I have been playing for the entire time it’s been out and can only get up to champ in rank so I know how much of a grind it is. And sure the difficulty can turn some people off but that’s why I like it so much. There’s really no ceiling to the skill. You can keep growing and growing and never actually master it. Plus it’s intense and fun to me. But I will admit it makes me rage more than anything I’ve ever played.
leafs,fdiegsc,t1_fdicjcl,1578441064.0,"Ok look, I feel you in some ways but this is where I think you’re wrong or I should say really to each their own. But in rocket league yes you’re right it’s a tough grind to the top and most will never get there but same can be said about chel. You have to have some talent to succeed. But when it comes to rocket league there is no advantages for anyone. You are relying solely on your talent to win. All cars are pretty much the same save for hit boxes but that’s it. No ones car is faster or stronger than the next. In chel you can be equal skill with the player you’re up against but he wins cuz he has McDavid and you don’t. Also there’s no cheap way to score in rocket league. As I said you have to will that ball in or somehow get a lucky pinch. Also when you have another player who gels with you there’s no better game to play and be good at. The synergy you can get from another player who matches you is simply wonderful and keeps me around through all the bullshit teammates who don’t know what they’re doing. To me Rocket league is the perfect game for what they set out to accomplish. Tell me what they could improve on to make it better? There’s no way they can, for what they want they achieved the perfect game. Not that it’s the perfect game period but when I say that I ask you to tell me what NHL games could do to improve and the list could be long.  I just don’t feel like rocket league can improve on its core gameplay which is why we haven’t seen a part 2. In some ways we are comparing apples and oranges but in terms of actual video games to me Rocket League is superior in every way. And I’m a huge hockey guy."

As if the driving conditions on the highway always dictate that we should be in the proper lanes. I live in Toronto and couldn’t really obey that if I tried. There’s so much volume on the highway that the left lane is rammed constantly. And even still if the highway is cleared enough and there’s room to move over the rest in here act like the dude doing 140kph should just be allowed to do it because “he’s passing others going slower”. There’s no excuse to be going that fast and they aren’t passing anyone in the traditional sense. They’re just going so fast that they’re passing others due to the reckless speed and selfishness. It’s not like they’re in the middle lane and want to move over and make a pass. They’re travelling in the left lane because they believe it’s the “fast” lane and they should be able to go as fast as they want because “it’s the fast lane”.
