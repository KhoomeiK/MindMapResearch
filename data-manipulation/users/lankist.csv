You go the exact opposite direction that the company wants you to. You do the absolute bare minimum to not get immediately fired, collect your check every two weeks and stop giving a flying fuck whether anything works at the end of the day.

In reality, it's a lot more difficult for a big company to fire you than you'd think. You could literally do nothing and survive for a *long* time. It takes *months* for HR and legal to build up documented cause for firing (at-will employment declaration of surplus notwithstanding.) And that timer only starts when someone decides they want rid of you. If you can fly under the radar, you can survive for years before someone says ""fuck that guy,"" and then you can *still* survive another six months while they try to put together the case to fire you. If you're paying attention, you should see the writing on the wall at that point when your boss is sniffing around and micromanaging you in particular, at which point you put 100% of your productive energy into finding another job.

If you're in a position to delegate or in a team that either won't let the ship sink or has collectively decided to be as useless as you've decided to be, you can last pretty much indefinitely. I've seen people make it upwards of ten years pulling that, then pull the ripcord and get another job somewhere else when the jig was finally up thanks to that nice, fancy ten-year experience bump on their resume. Major companies, by policy, will *NOT* talk shit about you if a prospective employer calls for a reference, as there have been multiple high-profile lawsuits that went the worker's way over shit-talking to hiring managers. Unless the company has no legal or HR, they will basically only ever confirm your employment dates and what your job is/was. They will not tell anyone if you were fired or laid off, nor will they evaluate your performance (it's also strategic, as a company is more than willing to let another company waste a salary on someone they think is useless.)

Treating workers like ""resources"" ultimately backfires, but there's no easy way to measure just how much it backfires because everyone is *pretending* to work as convincingly as they can and nobody is gonna' just out-and-out say ""fuck this."" So when you go to a board of directors and they ask for concrete numbers, the only numbers you can give them are how much money you've saved by dehumanizing your workers, even though that attitude has atrophied your productive workforce down to irrelevancy. Worse yet, the people in the decision-making roles frankly don't give two fucks if the company survives, because they've already got their golden parachutes ready to go and the whole thing is a big grift for them."

todayilearned,ffmidrk,t1_ffmar2t,1580055145.0,"> People are literally looking over your shoulder at all times, making you feel like you're being psychoanalyzed if you're not constantly working.

That's exactly why companies are going to this model. It's psychological warfare to make you work harder for no extra gain.

I worked a long time for a company that had a ""war room"" setup, which was a nice mix of the advantages you get with both models. Everyone had a ""home base"" office/cube where they could go to get some modicum of privacy, but there was a dedicated ""war room"" consisting of about two dozen tiny workstations connected to a small conference area where you would go for meetings, collaboration, reviews and crunch-time. You were expected to spend most of your time in that war-room during periods of high activity, but you also had a place to go when you just needed to get the fuck away and do some busy-work on your own.

Unfortunately, someone eventually said to themselves ""we can save so much space if we just make everyone's home-base the war room itself!"" They took the cubes and offices away and went to a ""fishbowl"" model, where seating was first-come-first-serve hoteling workstations with no reserved spaces for anyone below VP level. You couldn't even have personal effects like family photos, because the desk didn't belong to you and you had to pack up everything you brought with you at the end of the day.

In two months, like half the fucking staff either turned over and quit or just started working remotely from home without permission because they didn't have enough hoteling stations for the capacity the building was used to. When confronted, the work-from-homers had the built-in defense that they literally don't have a chair with their name on it in the whole building, so what's the fucking difference? Company couldn't say much, because when someone asked ""how do I do my work if I don't have a place to sit?"" the official answer was literally ""work remotely."" Productivity went through the fucking floor because all of the work that *couldn't* be done remotely stopped getting done at all. 

In addition, a *ton* of work was ""dual-hatted"" to people with the expectation that they were in the office anyway (e.g. they previous laid off all of the facilities administrative staff and made a bunch of random people handle supply receiving and distribution, printing and production equipment, etc.) Well, when those people started working from home and shrugged and said ""that stuff was voluntary, and was never a part of my actual job description,"" the company had to turn around and re-hire a bunch of staff to handle the day-to-day administrative tasks, which ultimately cost WAAAY more than they thought they'd saved by fucking everyone over. Oh, and those administrative staff *also* didn't have a guaranteed place to work, so their work was constantly slowed down while they spent the first two hours of every day trying to find a free hoteling station."

The more ambiguous nature of a streamer gives people the psychological wiggle-room to develop a parasocial bond with the streamer, feeling like that streamer is their friend because they occasionally read their name out loud on the screen. These people aren’t just looking for nudie pics—they’re looking for affirmation in the form of an (imagined) relationship, similar to Asian “idol” culture.

Take note this doesn’t mean the streamer is intentionally exploiting this effect. The streamer themselves is a passive participant, and views it as a transactional exchange. It’s the viewer that forms an inappropriate parasocial attachment due to an ambiguity of situation that the streamer didn’t necessarily intend for.

As soon as the circumstances change (professional differences, transfer, promotion, new job, etc.), that person is basically chopped liver to you because they only thing you had in common was that you had to be in the same room together every day or you'd starve to death. ""Friends by proximity.""

It was the ""water cooler"" show, same as Lost and many that came before it. It was the big thing because it had a low-ish barrier to entry and was something people could smalltalk about (see: Stranger Things Season 1.) It's more of a sporting event than it is a long-lasting property. Once the game is over and the drama is discussed, everyone moves on to the next game.

Most of the smalltalk shows don't last beyond their runtime. I'd say Breaking Bad is the exception, but Breaking Bad took **YEARS** to really take off in the public conscious. I remember picking up a DVD of the first season that was like five fuckin episodes years before anyone recognized it as a great show.

Frankly, I never gave GoT a chance even as everyone in my life was screaming in my ear that I needed to see it, because I'd already been burned on this by Lost and had that gut feeling it was going to go the same way here. You can't sustain a story on a single question to the end. With GoT, it was basically ""who wins the throne?"" The answer to which was never going to make an entirely compelling conclusion unless they took a much more radical direction, ditched the question as a premise and did something more interesting with the setup.

With Lost, the question was ""what the fuck,"" so they were doomed from the start. Good character drama, but nobody was really all that invested in the character drama. The characters were filler, and everyone was hooked on the nonexistent mythos.

It was the television equivalent of Mass Effect--it was held afloat by promises they could never keep, without which it would have never been so ubiquitous in the first place."

You act like I'm advocating for something. I'm explaining how shit works and how it's been studied.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(international_relations)

This isn't a matter of opinion. When I say ""realism,"" I'm not making some kitschy joke. I'm referring to an actual set of political philosophies dating back to Thucydides in 400 BCE. Realism is basically ""interest over ideology."" No matter how morally dignified a state is, its interests will always override any ideological concerns, and a nation will not let itself be burned on moral principle.

I'm not advocating for any set of behaviors. I'm explaining how the behavior of a state can be predicted. Realist theory exists to predict how a nation *will* behave, not to *suggest* how it *should* behave.

>Morality is the higher authority, by means of human rights.

No, that's an ideology. An authority is the enforcing body, of which there is none on the international level barring war--the suffering resulting from which would dwarf the instigating human rights violation."

Downvote and lecture all you want, but that's how nations function between themselves. There is no higher authority, and a nation will not only do whatever it wants, but anything and everything that it *can.*

There is only *domestic* law and order. You're taking the morality and principles from inside your domestic bubble and trying to apply them to the harsh world outside of it, which is something like trying to tell the vacuum of space that it should be more breathable. It would certainly be nice, but shouting into the void does not compel it to change.

The anarchic nature of the world outside is the entire reason *why* we came up with laws and governments--to impose a more moral standard against an unkind and unfair world. You're not wrong, you're just not understanding that you can't expect fairness outside of the borders that enforce it. You only have the luxury of morals because of the amoral actions taken in defense outside of the bubble. If you start holding international actions to the same artificial moral standard as domestic accountabilities, your system will collapse the moment another nation that doesn't give a fuck comes along and decides it wants something of yours.

worldnews,fesrjfp,t1_fesga43,1579368263.0,"I don’t think you understand what sovereignty is from a scholarly international affairs perspective. You’re talking about it like it’s a moral right, and it’s not. Sovereignty of borders and authority is something that’s established defensively. The key word of all international relations theory is “anarchy.” There is no law between nations. They will do as they please, even if they dress it up like they aren’t.

Sovereignty is not something that is “respected.” It is something that is defended. It's not a gentleman's agreement that all nations decided to respect. If you can’t defend yourself, you aren’t sovereign.

So you ask what I’d say about all the times the US violated another nation’s sovereignty, from a scholarly perspective, I’d say those nations clearly weren’t sovereign, or else they wouldn’t have been violated. You can argue the morality of the situation, but nations are amoral actors. The morality doesn't affect the decision.

technology,fear602,t1_fea2jip,1578951490.0,"> In a similar note, why do jobs make you submit a resume only to have you fill out everything by hand in separate forms afterwards? Usually the software tries to parse data from the resume to auto fill for you, but still, WHY. 

Because they're offloading the work onto you, unpaid.

Used to be their recruiters had to parse and process that information. Then they realized they could save money and cut recruiting staff by making you do all the work for them before they've even been committed to paying you anything.

Keep in mind, *YOU ARE DOING THE WORK FOR THEM.* So do NOT undersell yourself. Go as fucking far with your resume as you legally can. They're making you do the work for them, which gives you the opportunity to lie your little ass off to ping the buzzword detectors in their system. 

99.99% of the time nobody is actually reading your application--it's just getting filtered through automated software looking for keywords, which means you won't ever get anything unless you find a way to trigger the right combination of keywords. If they wanted someone to double-check your credentials, they shoulda' fuckin hired someone.

If you know anything about the recruiting/HR software you're using, you may also be able to embed a fuckton of keywords in your resume and/or its metadata that aren't visible when reading but are spotted by the software, so your name comes up as qualified for EVERY position in the entire system, which serves the dual purpose of getting your name up front for any position you actually apply for, and *really* pissing off the scumfuck cold-call recruiters that will call you later claiming they have an opportunity for you but it turns out to be some shit entry-level job you didn't fuckin' apply for."
