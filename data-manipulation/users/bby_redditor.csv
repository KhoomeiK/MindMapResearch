AskReddit,fgmk32r,t1_fgmj33w,1580926176.0,In my company I think there’s a law where they have to post and interview external candidates even though they have an internal candidate short listed.  It’s definitely frustrating.  If you really hit it off with the interviewers they might like you still and you could be on a short list of candidates for future roles.  You should try asking.

In other cultures, this kind of behaviour maybe understood differently or ignored all together.  


When I visited China I smiled at every service person who helped me, and my friend told me that no one smiles in China, that I looked like an idiot or mentally challenged or something lol."

But regardless of how the Chinese government paints a rosy  picture you will still have foreigners living and working in China getting their message out when they go back to their countries to visit family or when they post things using VPN. 

So all I’m saying is there is enough transparency to discredit any conspiracy that life in China is absolute shit.  It’s definitely shitty in some areas but some places are nice enough not to lie about."
