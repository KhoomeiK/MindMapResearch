It's not an easy answer. It's complicated as fuck and no two abortions will be for exactly the same reasons. Science tells us a early fetus is not a ""baby"" any more than a sperm is a baby.

If the ""pro-life"" crowd was really trying to lower the number of abortions that happen, they would support the things that have been *proven* to reduce them: (1) better access to birth control, (2) universal subsidized maternity leave and childcare, and (3) better sex ed in the schools.

Animals eat each other, sure, but we humans have evolved to the point that we understand nutrition and have the means to eat a plant-based diet. Since we can, we should. Killing things because they taste good is barbaric. We are better than that.

Many view meat-eating on par with slavery in the 19th century. It was accepted because of tradition, even though everyone knew it was barbaric and they made up all sorts of rationalizations for why it was ok.

We know it doesn't feel right to kill things capriciously. Give a normal 8 year old a knife and tell him to kill this rabbit I trapped; unless he is a sociopath (or starving) he will not be comfortable taking a life. Normal people and children have empathy for lesser creatures and find killing distasteful (if you will). This shows that we know it's wrong.

To anyone who has actually paid attention (to Mueller report, GAO report, and impeachment hearings), Trump is not on trial right now. His guilt is beyond doubt. The Senate majority is on trial right now.

I'm not sure if you've noticed this, but we have a big problem in the U.S. with people dying from being shot in school, Wal-Mart, church, concerts, etc.

If you don't see the racism, you should probably get your eyes checked, lol. 

The people in my own life who try to say Trump isn't racist are the kind that say: ""I don't hate black people, but why do they have to be all up in your face with it? Why do they have to dress like thugs and talk different?"" ( In other words, I am fine with black people, but only the ones that act like white people.)

I've also heard Trump apologists say the housing discrimination case wasn't racist because ""he had economic reasons"" for not wanting black tenants. ""He doesn't hate black people; he just didn't want property values to drop."" Sorry, but racism is more than just overtly saying "" I hate black people. "" It doesn't matter what your intentions are, if the outcome is racist, which it was.

politics,ff5h1k2,t1_ff5fzd9,1579592517.0,"Here's another great story, from during Trump's presidency:

In an intelligence briefing on hostages held by a terrorist group in Pakistan, Trump repeatedly interrupted the briefing to ask an Asian-American intelligence analyst who specializes in hostage situations ""where are you from?"" After she told him she was from New York he asked again and she clarified that she was from Manhattan. He pressed with the question until she finally told him that her parents were Korean. Trump then asked one of his advisers why ""the pretty Korean lady"" was not negotiating for him with North Korea.[152][153][154] NBC News characterized this exchange as Trump having ""seemed to suggest her ethnicity should determine her career path"".[155] Vox suggested that when Trump refused to accept New York as an answer he is ""saying that children of Asian immigrants can never truly be 'from' America. This isn't just simple bigotry; it feels like a rejection of the classic American 'melting pot' ideal altogether.""
