If storage conditions were to remain steady and sealed, as free from moisture and bacteria as possible, I'd guess possibly a million years.

A lot of the decay you see on mummies in museums is because they were exhumed in the 1800s-early 1900s with little regard for modern preservation techniques or long term storage. Mummies undisturbed would probably last for tens of thousands more years.

I am 100% not kidding when I say there was more buzz about the coin-op video game they had set up in the lobby than there was about the movie. I was the perfect age to see Tron, and I remember being bored by a lot of it.

I'll be an old man in explaining this. But there was something really cool about how the movie's visuals followed video game movements at that time. The fact that the characters drove those light cycles that made sharp, 90 degree turns was astounding. The fact was they were making the movie's effects to simulate video games *as people knew the at that time.* So it certainly had more impact on the audience then. Yes, Blade Runner and such did a better job visually, but the idea was to simulate video games *at that time.*

I think Jay is overstating that people knew nothing about home computers, and terminology at that time, too. I had a Commodore 64 then, and the basic concepts made internal sense to me then.

The problem was, they made a boring movie. Even at the perfect age of 12, I was mostly bored. Disney still had the Mary Poppins concept of what a Disney film should be in their corporate head then. Not saying Mary Poppins was bad. But they kind of re-skinned some of the feel, the bumbling characters and dialog, with this video game world and it didn't work."

.....

Before I even read this, I had been laying out a town based on real-world Italian coastal towns like Positano, Capri, etc. My campaign will be Mediterranean themed based on areas like that. I'm so sick and tired of generic middle-ages, middle-generic Europe flavor. And I'm sick of snow and cold, so this is a region of sunshine, vineyards and wine making, olive trees, plentiful freshwater streams, sheep, goats, agriculture.

The port town (mine will be a smaller shipping port than yours) is based also on Brugges: the idea being it was once a very wealthy port town whose river silted up, making it much smaller and more provincial and forgotten, home to smugglers and pirates now, along with some legit shipping. So there'll be ruins and remains of once-wealthy areas, but an overall run-down vibe. My other concept for it, as difficulty ramps up, is that a mysterious clouded island rose up out of the shallows offshore, causing earthquakes and flooding, and leading to people evacuating to a nearby city, leaving even more of a chaotic atmosphere. Old shipwrecks exposed by the upheaval.

The poor district— now very flooded— I call The Stilts, ramshackle village sprawl, on stilts over the water. This rambles out to the swamps, which I'm picturing like the Everglades. There will be a big tribe of ""natives"" halflings there, living in floating villages like seen in Lake Titicaca in our Peru. So some tension between the ancient inhabitant natives and the wealthy settlers who have ""only"" been there for 500-700 years. The wealthy town district built on the hills surrounding the port, is mostly abandoned and picked over, and the risen island caused earthquakes and fires, causing the wealthier people to flee.

By the time the adventurers arrive, the place has been looted and mostly empty except for the weirdos, people protecting what they have left, and smugglers, and brought back to semi-lawful by the authorities in the nearby city. But the players have been sent by some big-shot to find some missing important people, and figure out what the hell is going on with this weird, spooky island that appeared from beneath the waves.

I haven't fully figured out the mysterious, veiled island yet, but it will be for higher level play. Ruins of an extinct civilization of great power and magic have returned! Along with monsters, demons, etc.

Gonna have some mountains bound the place to the north, and have some shenanigans going on there with hill-folk tribes, etc. It's all a work in progress

But man, did your module come at the right time! As you can see, I can use a LOT of what you posted, just re skinned a bit."
dndnext,fezad1h,t1_fez95f0,1579455312.0,"Been wanting to play a Gloomstalker (ranger) in general, but this sounds like a particularly bad fit for Hell. Also sounds too ""lone wolf"" for this, as a party working together makes sense to me—especially in hell.

Now I'm thinking maybe a Bard, but I don't have experience with them Maybe a Bard who's magically inclined but not popular music-wise. And he wants popularity and fame and fortune! So he's up for making deals?"
dndnext,fez8lfp,t1_fez8gzj,1579454840.0,Any thoughts other than Paladin?
frugalmalefashion,feyohuh,t1_feyj3uo,1579448296.0,"Heh. Go to Old Navy and buy a men's T shirt in size M. Then use it as a beach towel!

Frugal!"
witcher,fewjuya,t1_fevzrb1,1579412150.0,"I'm pretty sure they cut down the frequency of Geralt saying ""Wind's howling,"" ""Dan, you're ugly"" and those other random things he'd say. It became a meme, and now replaying it, I don't rear it much at all."
witcher,fevz8gu,t1_fevtu71,1579403338.0,"I've been replaying W3 on my PS4. Did they tone down the wind, too? I remember playing it when it came out, and even in good weather the trees were always blowing around like in a storm. It's not like that now.

Could be my untrustworthy memory, though."
witcher,fevyesg,t1_feur21m,1579403128.0,"Roach wasn't great. But I liked that it was basically a reliable vehicle that I didn't have to brush, wash or feed, and I never once had to wipe Roach's butt."
dndnext,fev7mlp,t1_fesyv3t,1579394136.0,(it's that way so they can keep selling books to Whales for $50 a pop)
DnDBehindTheScreen,fev6kts,t3_e93wax,1579393688.0,I just found this. I'll be using parts of this in my campaign. I especially like your organization and layout. I can re-skin as I  need it. Very nicely done.
PS4,feu7yuu,t1_feu3hvi,1579384003.0,Do you keep it near the floor?
frugalmalefashion,feu56hs,t3_eqgy1t,1579383226.0,Everything is so boxy at this place.
