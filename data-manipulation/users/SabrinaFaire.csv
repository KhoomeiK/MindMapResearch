Pets,fffm4eo,t1_fffj8zt,1579886919.0,Happy to help! :)
Pets,fffiqjn,t3_etbikb,1579884834.0,"Looks like Petco does. I've never ordered food from their online store though. [HollywoodFeed.com](https://HollywoodFeed.com) does as well. I haven't used them but a friend does and has never had problems. They were a client of a company I used to work for, so I knew they were a legit organization."
HealthInsurance,ffctt4l,t3_esxdsn,1579807118.0,"You can try. At my company we have an International Claim form that folks use for claims that happened while on cruises or other travel. If it does get applied to anything, it will likely get applied to your out of network max, not your in network, which may not really help with your regular claims if you normally see in network providers. But it doesn't hurt to ask. If you can't find a form on their website you may need to call their customer service for that form."
Pets,ffcj8ly,t3_esusbf,1579800631.0,"That's bullshit. One of my cats is on an Rx food and my vet (vets actually, she had to see a specialist) realizes that food is fucking expensive and will call in a Rx for me. Fuck she gave me the Rx written out so I could take it to Petsmart to get some until I could get a Chewy order in. (They actually don't carry that kind in the office.) Your vet is a dick. I get that they need to make money and vets end up with almost medical school level student loan debt and then are expected to run their own business and have a hard time making money with people who can't pay wanting them to save their pets. I get it. But if someone can't afford their pets food they will either put the animal down or take it to a shelter where it won't get adopted b/c of its health issues. Which doesn't benefit the animal and loses the vet a client because you're not likely to return there with a new pet."
Pets,ffcic86,t1_ffcbugx,1579800085.0,"For a lot of people keeping a pet means being able to afford it and if the vet truly had the animal's best interests in mind, they would realize this and send the ""Rx"" to Chewy."
Insurance,ffbzdfo,t1_ffbkt68,1579787508.0,"Our claims come in through a queue system. They are either scanned in if they are mailed or faxed or they come in through an electronic EDI system. Most are electronic. I open the claim and look for any comments on it to see if it's been routed to support departments and if so, what they say to do. Otherwise the claim has ""exceptions"" on it that need to be handled before approving/denying/returning the claim. They can vary between a coding problem that we need to send back to the provider's office to fix, verifying a CPAP rental hasn't exceeded the purchase price, or verifying if something has a preauthorization on file. Sometimes we route things to other departments if there's a pricing issue or if the units on the claim exceed what's on the preauth or if the claim indicates another insurance provider that the patient has. It's not really difficult work, but I have plenty of coworkers that fuck it up. I mean everyone makes mistakes and it can be boring, but some of them do the same thing over and over again and it makes me wonder. It's a very entry level job and most folks transfer out once their year is up."

Omaha,ff9apgp,t1_ff9ak55,1579708680.0,"Thanks! Not sure why I didn't think of letting my fingers do the walking. Not being sarcastic, seriously just didn't occur to me."
Insurance,ff99pgz,t3_esdbck,1579708055.0,"You don't have to be on hers, no. However, open enrollment for [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) is over for the year, and short of a qualifying event (marriage, divorce, birth/death of a dependent, and a few others) you won't be able to enroll in a marketplace plan. Your only options until the next enrollment is a short term plan or your state's Medicaid, if you qualify. Short term plans, assuming you're not in CA where they are illegal, can be found through insurance agents/brokers and some carrier websites."
diabetes,ff95byg,t3_esc051,1579705205.0,"Hypoglycemia is a thing, where your blood sugar is too low. People with diabetes only have lows when they've taken too much insulin or medication vs. how much sugars/carbs they've eaten.

HealthInsurance,ff93ygy,t1_ff8gp60,1579704268.0,"Not the OP but because all BCBS are separate, it's possible that one BCBS covers something that Anthem specifically does not. The BCBS Association does not set requirements of what is and is not covered by it's affiliates. 

Think of BCBS as the MLB or NFL and each individual BCBS as one of their affiliated teams."

HealthInsurance,ff90sff,t3_es7mr3,1579701949.0,"Guess what, this is their fucking problem. They had the information and they couldn't get their shit together, now they get to eat the bill. Just like the other poster said, you're in the clear on this one."
Insurance,ff90llf,t3_es9xq5,1579701798.0,"I work in health and dental claims and all you really need is a HS diploma or GED. Some experience is nice, but not required. CS pays a bit better at my company, but then you have to be on the phones all day. Educational requirements are about the same."
