agedlikemilk,fgmdi6i,t1_fgm9pzj,1580922458.0,"If the Democrats rigged the election against Sanders, why is Sanders running as a Democrat again and not as the independent that he operates as when he's not running for president?"
agedlikemilk,fgmd81h,t1_fgm7j9d,1580922314.0,You're an idiot if you think that conspiracy theory is true. You're buying right into the Russian/Trump propaganda.
agedlikemilk,fgm6fzo,t1_fgm602h,1580918842.0,"Weird how Sanders supporters have done the same. Can't acknowledge any loss. Everyone else is the bad guy. For us or against us bullshit. You live in a vacuum and think everyone wants Sanders as president. We don't. I disagree with him and his policies, but by God I'll vote for him over Trump if he gets the nomination. Will you do the same for the candidate who gets it over him? If history is any evidence, you won't."

I don't care for my guy gets in right now I only want Trump out."
news,fglpulf,t1_fglpffc,1580907637.0,"And in his entire career in the Senate, what has Sanders accomplished? Naming a post office? using big words to distract from the fact that you have no valid point all only works on stupid people. I can see right through you.

Trump being president is on the hands of you losers who refused to vote for Hillary because your guy didn't get the nomination. You were played by Trump and the Russians and are too stupid to realize it."
