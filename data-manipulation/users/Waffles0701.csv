bipolar,fep452g,t1_fep3az7,1579311717.0,"I agree. This is (rightfully) beyond your ability to assist on your own. She needs immediate care.

Partners of people like us have the patience of saints. I just asked my husband how he copes, he said he takes one day at a time, and that no matter how bad my lows get, he knows that the “real” me will be back."
bipolar,fep3ob2,t3_eq9s5x,1579311421.0,Hell yes! Little steps. Xx
bipolar,feojnx5,t1_fenigxn,1579301042.0,"It’s my absolute pleasure. 

It’s so difficult to find people that do understand, because I know for me I don’t even understand all of it! (11 years since diagnosis). Here you can take bits and pieces from others’ experiences. I can’t tell you how many times over the last few months when reading posts and comments here something’s just clicked in my head and made sense. 
Definitely share your art. Sometimes you don’t need words."
bipolar,fekke5h,t1_fekapsi,1579201883.0,"Outside therapy, it’s this app and this subreddit to be honest. It’s a great group of people here. There’s heaps of creative people who share their art, people with questions and people who need to talk. 
It’s great to be with people that actually understand the intricacies of bipolar, and there’s massive respect paid when someone in is in a low. For me it’s knowing when to switch off as some lows can trigger mine."
bipolar,fejgwxj,t1_fej3cve,1579173709.0,"Yeah I do! I got it when it was on sale. I really like the different reviews, you can get a yearly one which is great."
bipolar,feiv021,t1_feimv3s,1579147944.0,You have no idea how much this helped me. Thank you.
bipolar,feiuxdp,t1_feilrdl,1579147886.0,I think for me it’s to look back and review what exactly triggers you. When you log each day you can pick the activities that you were doing that contribute to how up/down you are. So so helpful.
bipolar,fei7e7i,t1_fei35e8,1579131938.0,Did you inherit your bipolar from her?

bipolar,fehyi3j,t3_ep95ap,1579126427.0,Has anyone with bipolar had their children resent them because of it?

bipolar,fd4thlf,t3_ejz1vm,1578170932.0,"When I’m stressed or alarmed my teeth will chatter. That’s a relatively new thing. 
Also if I exert a lot of emotional energy, I get this huge wave of exhaustion where I almost have to lean on something."
bipolar,fcymrxn,t1_fcxa54h,1578082934.0,"No, that’s a different one. This one has January Jones and Kaya Scodelario."
bipolar,fcvlylm,t1_fcuz44c,1578004950.0,Oh thank you!
bipolar,fcvlxpy,t1_fcv95n7,1578004935.0,Bonus day! Maybe I’ll sketch a unicorn.
UnsentLetters,fctz2kz,t3_eiud3f,1577966575.0,Be brave and tell them.
