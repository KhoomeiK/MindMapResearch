Look at China, they have a 1 child policy and they're still overcrowded with no relief in sight. If the future of climate change is as bad as predicted, there will be less places for us to go and more people than can fit there.  Of course the problem is exactly what you pointed out, that it is a moral minefield. How it's addressed is vital, but ignoring it won't make it go away"

Once you start getting into shielded, plenum and that kind of shit, the faster cables skyrocket in price.
