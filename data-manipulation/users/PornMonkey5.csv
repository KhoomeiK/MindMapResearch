freemasonry,feko5ep,t1_fekfawa,1579204114.0,"> but its dishonest to say that that freemasonry doesn't interfere with certain religious and political sentiments 

I didn't say that. I said that religion and politics are forbidden subjects because of the divide they create. The craft is what it is and the members need time to learn the order. Many members have difficulty understanding the craft and for various reasons can't abide due to that not understanding.

It remains a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols.

At that root, the morality it teaches is to be within due bounds of all mankind, be upright in intention and actions, be level in dealing with others and square in how you deal with them.

I know Masons who are politicians of a given political party. It has little effect on their practice of improving the self through the craft.
I know masons who are priests of several faiths who sit in the same lodge.

The craft is something to be drawn from for individual development and within the circle with brethren who seek the same.

Masonry doesn't interfere with ones religion or politics, that would be one, themselves believing that somehow the institution of masonry is somehow not inert and affecting them. That is a misunderstanding.

It's akin to saying that the tools screwed up the job and not the lack of knowledge with the carpenter who did it. Because we all know that, ""poor is the carpenter that blames his tools""
