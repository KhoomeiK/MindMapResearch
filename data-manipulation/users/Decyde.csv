I think overall I purchased 8 sets that cost me $60 + $70 so for $130, I got a decent amount of tools that would be alright.

In 1924, the F. Laeisz Company bought her back for £7,000 and put her into service in the nitrate trade again. Laeisz sold her in 1931 to the Finnish shipping company of Gustaf Erikson, which used her in the Australian wheat trade.

In March 1951, Belgian shipbreakers paid £40,000 for her and Passat.[6] As she was being towed to Antwerp, German shipowner Heinz Schliewen, who had sailed on her in the late 1920s, bought her (and Passat, thus often erroneously referred to as a sister ship).

Pamir's last voyage was the only one in her school ship career during which she made a profit, as the insurance sum of about 2.2 million Deutsche Mark was sufficient to cover the company losses for that year. While there was no indication that this was the intention of the consortium, which was never legally blamed for the sinking, some later researchers have considered that through its neglect it was at least strongly implicated in the loss.[11] But the Germanischer Lloyd had recently certified her as seaworthy.[14"

I think it took him 2 weeks to get the city to approve extending his cement pad extension to move it over.

They wouldnt have sent someone out on the deadline if he showed them he was making an attempt to fix the problem but he was being a dick about it as you could imagine with how pissed he was."

mildlyinfuriating,fef6tr1,t1_feelcnm,1579049554.0,"Just call the city and file a complaint. There cant be a way they got a permit for that.

My friends neighbor was a raging cunt and use to put his trash cans around my car if I was parked an inch over the property line in the street. 

I asked him to stop and he said ""I should respect his home."" In which I told him he parks in his garage and the street is city property....

Anyways, that summer he put up a shed that was within 2 feet of my friends property line. Having put a shed up 2 years prior in my friends yard, the city is strict about that 2 foot rule and I filed a complaint.

Sure enough, he didnt get a permit for his cement foundation, $4k mega shed and tried to follow the proper channels to get it approved so he wouldnt have to move it.

I showed up to the city council meeting when he went to dispute his case and after he spoke, I spoke and said it wouldnt be right of the city to grant him special permissions for shitty on our great town by not even having the decentcy to file a permit to make sure it was put up to code to begin with.

He ended up paying to have a crane come and move the shed like a foot over to the right after adding more onto the foundation. That could not have been cheap at all.

I got out of class one night at 10 pm and I had work the following morning at 6 am.  I knew going in a locksmith would charge over $100 to come out and unlock my car with a hour+ wait on it.

I just grabbed a rock when I realized my keys were in the car and busted out the passenger side window like in the picture.  Since my car was a common Grand AM, I ended up getting a replacement window from my salvage yard in town, installed for less than $22.

DO NOT BREAK THE SMALLER WINDOWS OUT.  Those are a bitch and a half to replace and cost a lot to boot.  People think it's easier to fix a smaller window like that but you have to use adhesive to fix the thing back on while windows like OP has pictured, you just pop off that inside interior and put the new window on the tracks most of the time."
