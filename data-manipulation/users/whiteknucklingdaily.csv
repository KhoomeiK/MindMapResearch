Advice,fcwpr3k,t1_fcwo6ir,1578032897.0,Thank you. You’ve been helpful. I’ll try calling around tomorrow. I actually do not still have my partner and that is why it is so important to me.
AskReddit,fcw1t36,t1_fctduvh,1578015175.0,I’m sorry to hear that. I’ve felt the same many times before and made the choice one year to plan to be alone and do the things I wanted to do with no pressure. It might have been my most enjoyable New Years to date. It isn’t for everyone but I hope you get the chance to make the choice of what you want to do and how you feel next year. Positive vibes.
AskReddit,fctcest,t1_fctbwb8,1577938894.0,There’s nothing wrong with not searching and just keeping your eyes out. There’s no right or perfect way to find a partner. Being the best you is all that’s in your control so whether you go looking or not good luck!
AskReddit,fctc7a7,t1_fctbj68,1577938722.0,It sounds like your best friend is a really special person. I’m glad you’ve both found each other in life and are able to hold on to that friendship despite the distance. I hope you’re able to find someone just as caring in your location now. Happy New Year.
AskReddit,fctc15p,t1_fctbfn4,1577938580.0,I’m sorry to hear that. I hope the year only gets better for you and you’re able to find supportive people to surround yourself with.
AskReddit,fctbpxn,t1_fctb8v2,1577938312.0,I’m sorry she didn’t take you up on your offer. Studio Ghibli is amazing. Hopefully through consistent friendship and proving you can be there for her - she’ll see you in the same light as the day when she gave you her number. Good luck out there.
AskReddit,fctbktm,t1_fctb7dv,1577938193.0,I understand the feeling. I hope a year from now you can look back on this day and be amazed at how far you’ve come. And if no one has said it to you - happy new year.
AskReddit,fctbhqm,t1_fctb4lm,1577938121.0,I’m glad you enjoyed your night.

offmychest,fcm8svp,t3_ehxni4,1577767304.0,You’ve got this! Your partner is wonderful for supporting you through this and you will find the people who don’t treat you as an option and make you a priority!
