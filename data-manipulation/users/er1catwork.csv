cookingforbeginners,ffiice4,t3_etpn0j,1579974561.0,"I have a 15 year old rice cooker. Works great! My (soon to be ex) wife makes hers the old fashioned way (frying in oil with garlic and then simmer). I can come close to what hers tastes like but can't nail it. My daughter (9 years old) swears she can't tell a difference between mine and moms. So, unless you are a rice fanatic, go with the cooker!"
alexa,ff8ufqn,t1_ff8294h,1579696463.0,Damn! This was the setting I have been looking for to control my TV/Stick for months. Guess I am out of luck :(
oddlysatisfying,ff2td8z,t1_ff2kefj,1579523349.0,"I used to use a special foil that you printed what you wanted on a laser printer, attached the foil, and ran it through the printer again. I guess the fuser heat was enough to melt it. Tired a box of Dollar Store Christmas Cards to really neat things!"

cookingforbeginners,feukucx,t3_eqgnt0,1579387491.0,"Well, if anyone is curious... I seared the beef earlier and tossed it on the top shelf of the fridge ( coldest place in my fridge ), ran out and picked up my daughter. Got home and started braising the hunk of top round. It was a 3#, cut in half. I figured 1.5# should be enough for the two of us. With 30 minutes left, I threw in cut up potatoes and carrots (I made the stock with 5 quartered cloves of garlic, 1/2 onion cut into 1” pieces, and Progresso beef stock. Sadly, the potatoes and carrots came out mushy :( Happily, we devoured the beef and I have another 1.5# to try and not screw up next weekend!

Thanks for your advices!"

funny,fer2te6,t3_eqejp4,1579349035.0,Reminds me of the tall winter boot (Uggs) fashion trend of the 90’s (maybe? Can’t remember when it was...) where all the women wore them and  mocha or frapachino in hand was a must have accessory...

Once it detects the wake word, it turns on the brains which listen for your request. The two are never operating at the same time. I’m probably off on my explanation but I’m pretty sure that what I read somewhere....."

amateurradio,fekfwql,t3_epav7c,1579199202.0,What about an antenna made out of adhesive foil (like the old alarm systems used around business windows? You could cut it to length and put in the rear window or up front right at the edge of the windshield?
