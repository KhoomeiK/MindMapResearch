nfl,ffex3zu,t1_ffeby5l,1579869051.0,That’s beautiful. Can’t argue anymore because now I’m weeping.
nfl,ffex0dv,t1_ffe19ly,1579868948.0,Why not both?
confession,ffdkb44,t1_ffdjtlx,1579822686.0,I understand it perfectly well. You are taking anecdotes — “based on what I’ve seen” and saying something general about men — that they’re usually the ones who engage in this behavior. And then you’re saying because of that it’s okay to treat this behavior — being on  your phone in the bathroom — differently depending on the gender of the person doing it. That is textbook sexism.
confession,ffdjk4t,t1_ffdcf4e,1579822228.0,So you’re taking anecdotal evidence and using that to make a general assumption about all members of one particular gender and that is somehow not sexist?
confession,ffdben5,t1_ffcxzxn,1579817255.0,"usually, yeah, but there’s some shit moms out there. Also some great dads. still sexist"
confession,ffcj37f,t3_esvb91,1579800539.0,The comments are shit. If you said you were a mom you would have gotten more empathy but since you’re a dad you get hate.

nfl,ffchkiu,t1_ffcgmi8,1579799615.0,"He was. 

And that’s the thing you have to take into account — it’s the Hall of *Fame*, not the hall of “amazing stats”. He won Super Bowl MVP in both games he was in, and beat the most dominant dynasty in the NFL twice. Just look at the highlights. Tells the story itself. Yeah he went on to play subpar but you can’t deny his impact."
nfl,ffbvmq4,t3_esjuiz,1579784274.0,I need to get me an Eli Manning jersey. As a Bills fan the man who took down Tom Brady and the Patriots twice in spectacular fashion will forever be my hero.

nfl,ffbth0n,t1_ffbfzk2,1579782142.0,Everyone loves to shit on Eli but the guy showed up for the big games and that’s all that matters. He better get in the hall of fame.

unpopularopinion,ff9krmx,t3_erx2x0,1579715081.0,"We’ve overcorrected in attempt to be “PC”. It’s the same reason why you can say the most vile, racist shit about white people and it’s all fine and good, but the second you say something that needs olympic level mental gymnastics to be misconstrued into something offensive about any other race you get shat on."
