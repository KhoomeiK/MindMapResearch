ABoringDystopia,ffjb17u,t1_ffj8smy,1579994539.0,Bed Stuy is improving all the time. Bushwick may still be a good option.

todayilearned,ffcmxgs,t1_ffby8tm,1579802861.0,If there is a 'Cod' or 'Salt'-esque book about ice cream I would binge-read it with a few pints of Ben & Jerry's to keep me going.
Anticonsumption,ffcmo1h,t1_ffcbxvm,1579802704.0,"Sounds like you're talking about full blown [life cycle assessments](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment)

The good news is that the methodology for robust LCAs has come a long way in the last 30 years. However, the ISO guidelines need much updating, and there's a seemingly endless need for more data on everything.

My LCA professor told me that the golden age of LCAs is not yet here. It's still an evolving, maturing science. The lofty goal one day is to have LCAs incorporated into every economic action, both business decisions and end-user goods and services. We'll move beyond ""cradle to grave"" and start thinking about material impacts from ""cradle to cradle."" And with any luck, we'll reach truly circular, sustainable economies."

Can anyone see in the original report the size of the multifamily building? Floors, units, SQFT or M^2, etc?"

sustainability,ffbttcs,t1_ffbsh5c,1579782498.0,"Like with most  things, it's about moderation. Only have kids if you really want them and are ready. Practice good family planning, birth control etc. Consider adopting, especially if you want more than 1 or 2, so that your family's generational net biological population gain is negative or flat. Think sustainably in all aspects of home life.

Because if the socially and environmentally conscious all abstained from children, we would literally end up with Idiocracy. Hordes of children with poor education, and increasingly wasteful consumption lifestyle, and little sense of environmental stewardship."

hondafit,ffay0be,t1_ffambcc,1579747111.0,"How much did you air out the car before starting? It literally can hold the moisture from your previous drive.

FYI, freezing cold outside air has *very* little moisture in it. So even if you had some leak near the windshield, there wouldn't be much moisture getting in during the winter.

Our Fits are small cars. We breath out about 400mL of water each day, or about 16.6mL or 1.12 Tbl of water each hour."
