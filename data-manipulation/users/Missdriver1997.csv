Man that Von Einem guy is seriously one of the most evil people ever. Its honestly scary a guy like him exists. America has some horrible serial killers that a lot of people know about- but a lot of people dont know about him, especially internationally.

We dont really have those in my country, except for retirement communities. How did the murderer/perp get in? Also i find it strange that only the Man was decapitated. If both of them were in a business venture together and owed people some money, you would think the evil murderer would kill them both in the same way?
