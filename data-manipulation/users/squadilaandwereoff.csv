insanepeoplefacebook,ffp1xhk,t3_eubgfi,1580084531.0,Honestly what it comes down to is a grade school teacher does not need a masters. If academia continues to push itself maybe it should make those who are trying to enter the profession not spend such an asinine amount to teach younger children.
insanepeoplefacebook,ffp1tc0,t1_ffnrluz,1580084470.0,Overall I have found that the idea of giving people who are not great at something more money does not make them better. Giving a 5 dollar hooker 1000 will not make her fuck any better.

worldpolitics,ffjgbbq,t3_etul14,1579997642.0,Locations without toilets are less likely to be frequented thus drawing in fewer people. Public locations without a toilet become the real tax sink.
walmart,ffjbe65,t1_ffjaslq,1579994753.0,Changes nothing. You wanted more for yourself you went for it. You have a sense of desire ambition and agency. The real bullshit is RN's making 19 an hour. That's real bullshit. A cashier making 12 or less. Not bullshit.
walmart,ffjab44,t1_ffj8dg0,1579994110.0,"You are here talking about how the company that employs 2.3 million people many of whom perform entry level jobs should be making 15 an hour. This makes minimal sense. One as much as people want to say the reason they left walmart is because of pay. Its honest to God usually just 2 things. Assistant managers and the customers. It's not that the pay isn't enough. I could force feed 15 dollars into an associates hand and they still wouldn't put up with the bullshit some of the locations have to deal with. Nor should they. Nor does giving associates more attract anything special. It's the same degree of employee potentially worse attracted to the 15 dollar an hour position. 

So what's the next natural step. That's right if I'm paying you 15 dollars an hour I'm going to get the labors worth out of you. Amazon distribution centers are a great example of what to expect there. 

So good for you going to college. Glad you got out of minimum wage positions. But tossing your salt into the soup didn't add flavor. It's just more of the same nonsensical hate based on ""but they could afford to do so""."
walmart,ffj2s0f,t1_ffio2ue,1579988940.0,Ah understood I see you were just stirring up nonsense for things that dont apply to you. Good to see you care so strongly and still think this is a valid retort.
walmart,ffinhal,t1_ffi585q,1579978104.0,I mean you can go work in an Amazon distribution center at 15 dollars an hour if you wanna give it the college try. You might die but hey that's what it's there for.

And you saying the government is owed this money because gymnastic thinking.
PoliticalCompassMemes,fejkt70,t1_feisur4,1579178252.0,If you have no home that wont stop the government from taking you off the streets and resuming you to a cell via armed men if you evade taxes. You sign a contract with your landlord for services/goods for you the one renting the property to follow. I can get behind sales tax. But income tax is straight theft.
PoliticalCompassMemes,feis1iq,t1_feims2a,1579145748.0,If you do not pay your taxes men with guns come to take your stuff. If you resist you may be assaulted or worse.

walmart,fegk5hd,t1_feg2e1l,1579095211.0,I'm sorry but the absolute scum that I have witnessed have led me to a similar train of thought. Calling over to 1800 walmart when I worked there to tell me they were going to beat the girl at the register till she was hospitalized because she said hey that SCO is cash only. Working in the stores was it's own hell too. As much as the consumer is important we here in America have taken it to an extreme. The customer has become God and management is afraid to back their own associates who are in the right. A customer is one thing. But scum is another. They should be handled accordingly.

""You dont know the difference""

Air of superiority over anyone who disagrees with viewpoint. Unquestioned belief in your own premise.

Your right your not a member of the general public. Sound like clergy to me.

The only important difference is whether your information is reliable based off of data gathered.  Given the nature of the data and its collection no it is not.

The issue you are taking with the whole thing here is it discredits your belief. That's the end result of it all. You are dismissive of me and willing to treat others and myself as ignorant based on that lone deduction. No different than a pastor at the pulpit preaching to the atheist.

What you are telling me is nonsense as the general usage of the word falls outside your current understanding.

Understanding that issue is the first step in making sure that poor use of information doesnt become a difficult to resolve and annoying to explain premise. It's not that I dont know what a soft science is. It's that I know the term when applied to the general public will be interpreted two ways.
