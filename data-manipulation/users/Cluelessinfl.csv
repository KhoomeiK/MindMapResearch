god,ffuvczw,t3_evcmis,1580250046.0,"I wonder about this too. I have spoken harshly to God and called Him terrible things (curse words) at times of anger and frustration. But, is that blasphemy? I always thought it was. But someone years ago told me blasphemy is denying that God is God, or that He even exists or that He is as powerful as He says. If I'm wrong, then sadly I'm going to hell too. I've confessed to Him, but then still cursed Him out a few times. I guess it is blasphemy because it shows that I don't fully believe His power. But I do believe He exists (or some higher power does)."
