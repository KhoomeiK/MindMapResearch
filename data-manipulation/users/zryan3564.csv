AskReddit,ffsrd4s,t3_ev131w,1580189733.0,I was walking in the city one day and I stopped at a cross walk. The guy next to me wasn't paying attention and started walking out into traffic. I saw a car just about to hit the guy when I grabbed him and pulled him back. He lost his shoe but he survived. He was extremely grateful. That's kind of a rescue story.
relationship_advice,ffsr575,t3_ev137i,1580189529.0,I can understand where they are coming from. I would recommend not telling them you are bi. You can tell them it's your first time being with a girl. Try to put yourself in their shoes. If a guy came up to you and said he was bi and wanted to try girls for the first time. I bet that would turn you off. I'm guessing it's like that for the girls you talked too. When you talk to a girl keep it simple.  I'm a guy so I could be way wrong on this. It's just what I would do if I was in your shoes.
relationship_advice,ffsqs53,t3_ev13db,1580189187.0,You should probably go to a urologist. You are young so there could be a medical problem that needs to be taken care of.  He might just recommend going to a counselor if he thinks it's a mental health thing.  In the meantime I recommend getting a cock ring. It sounds like you get an erection but then lose it before entering her. If you get a cock ring you can put it on once you get an erection and the ring will squeeze the base of your penis preventing the blood from flowing out and losing your erection. I wish you luck with everything.
AskMen,ffs7tar,t1_ffrn8zg,1580175262.0,It does work. Those stainless steel shaped like a bar of soap wouldn't be do popular if it wasn't true.

AskReddit,ffqi39b,t3_eunqw9,1580135211.0,Yes definitely toxic. Some people are willing to do the dumbest things in order to get a few likes. Look at all these challenges that come from social media.  Then you have the anonymity of social media. People can say whatever they want to whoever they want and not get in trouble for it. Some people see making fun of someone (bullying) as a form of entertainment.

depression,ffqhgyl,t3_eunrat,1580134716.0,"It sounds like to me you need a vacation. February 17th is President's day. It's a Monday so you will have a long weekend. Why don't you talk to your boyfriend and see if he has that day off. If not tell him exactly what you told us and ask him to take Monday off so you two can go on a trip. It doesn't have to be an expensive trip. Maybe somewhere that is just a few hours car ride and get a cheap motel for a few night. I live in NY and my wife and I would travel 4 hours to go up to the Adirondack mountains and rent a room in a cheap motel for a few nights. It was just far enough to feel like a vacation and it wasn't expensive at all. 

As far as your room mate you and your boyfriend need to sit him/her down and tell them what they are doing wrong. Maybe he doesn't realise what he's doing or maybe he just needs a reminder. 

Don't worry about not going to that meeting. You aren't the first student teacher who took a mental health day and you won't be the last. If you are worried I wouldn't take another one for a while. Teaching is hard I know. My ex is a teacher and she went through everything you are going through. Including all the feelings you have right now.

photoshopbattles,ffqg6ue,t3_eunrra,1580133650.0,My mom had cancer about 10 years ago. My dad was making dinner when he found a potato with a cool face on it. My mom liked it so much she named it and brought it with her to every chemo session. After a while it stated to shrivel up so my dad put a coat of lacquer on it and bough Mr. Potato Head pieces to it had a face again. It was silly but it kept my mom's spirits up.

AskReddit,ffqfsyy,t1_ffqdfll,1580133321.0,I agree.
AskReddit,ffqfs1b,t3_eunrxe,1580133299.0,The girl cheated on me. So it really wasn't a hard decision. A good way to tell though is if you aren't happy. If the person doesn't make you happy then it's a good indicator that they aren't right for you. Also if you are fighting all the time or maybe you just found out you have nothing in common. Being with someone that is really attractive is great but if they don't have the same interests then the relationship will never work.
AskReddit,ffqfiah,t3_euns1c,1580133065.0,I don't think it takes just willingness. It also takes money. It's not profitable to start a restaurant in a small town.
NoStupidQuestions,ffqfbzw,t3_euns1g,1580132913.0,Airport security is advanced but it doesn't really do anything if it's not used correctly.  Several years after 9/11 the US government tested to see how well the TSA was preforming. The government wanted to see how many bombs could get through airport security. The TSA did horrible. 95% of the bombs got through airport security. I'm sure getting an animal through is a little tougher depending on the animal but the point is the TSA miss a lot.
AskReddit,ffqeugl,t3_euns2l,1580132489.0,That movie Watchmen had a leader that turned on the super heroes I think. I haven't seen the movie in a long time so I could be wrong. If I'm right that would be a pretty shitty leader.
relationship_advice,ffqeqiz,t3_euns30,1580132393.0,If they truly mislead him and he has proof I bet he could sue the school to get his money back. Like if he has a pamphlet or some paper with the school's letterhead saying it's an accredited school then he would definitely win.
depression,ffqek1b,t3_eunsc9,1580132231.0,I'm not sure about the expect percentage but I know a lot of people suffer from regular depression. Not suicidal or severe depression.  I think it was something like 3 million new patients per year in the US. Being suicidal or being manic is half that.  You can basically look within your family and it's a good chance at least one person is or has had depression.  You don't need to win the lottery to get better. It is hard work though. If you really want to get better going to a good counselor and a psychiatrist is a huge start.

AskMen,ffpm73s,t1_ffpcpal,1580098515.0,"That's not what I ment. I'm saying if someone was in a depression slump and knew how to get out don't you think they would use what they know to get out of the slump?  So they wouldn't be in the slump. I wrote the comment because he asked guys who are in a depression slump.    It's like asking ""guys who are trapped in a hole, how do you get out?"" Well if they knew how to get out of the hole they wouldn't be still trapped in one.   

I've been dealing with depression for 9 years. If I know how to just ""get out"" of the slump I would. It takes lots of counseling and in my case medication."

AskMen,ffotpgf,t3_euf28m,1580081683.0,Im guessing the guys who are in a depressed slump don't know how to get out. If they did they wouldn't be in a slump.   My counselor tells me to think positive. Forcing yourself to go out and socialize helps sometimes.  I do recommend you get a counselor. If you are actually depressed it's hard to deal with that yourself. A counselor will help move you in the right direction. I wish you the best.
AskReddit,ffmd5fz,t3_eu7vjr,1580052694.0,Unfortunately yes it will be 4 more years of the same if Trump wins. The left has so much hatred for Trump it won't stop. I blame the media. They never give Trump credit for his accomplishments and they also make up lies about him. When they get caught in their lies or fake stories they don't correct themselves. So the public goes on thinking those lies are true. It's not Trump dividing this country it's the left wing media and democrats in office. Those same people slammed Trump for not saying he would accept the outcome of the election if Hilary won. Well Trump won and the left isn't accepting the outcome. They are trying to change it.  It's sad.
AskReddit,ffmcnpb,t1_ffmbk3l,1580052434.0,No way. The hatred for Trump is way worse than Obama and Bush.   At least with Obama and Bush people gave them credit where credit was due. The left never say Trump did a good job with something. The left media was actually hoping for a recession so they didn't have to talk about a good economy.  Who does that?

AskReddit,ffiau2e,t3_etshl7,1579969458.0,"Yes it is. The US is the greatest country because of the freedoms people have.

The US accepts all people. As long as you aren't coming to the US to hurt or take advantage of American people you can become an American citizen.   There are other reasons but none are more important than freedom.  I'll send you a link where you can read more. I don't want my comment to be deleted by the bot so I'm not going to post the link here.

NoStupidQuestions,ffi9kib,t3_etshog,1579968576.0,No. A space force will be putting weapons in space. If Russia or another country put a satellite in space with nukes on it that will put US in danger. Right now if Russia shoots a nuke from Russia to the US we can see it coming and possible shoot it down. If the Nike is fired down from a satellite we won't have time to react. What I understand about space force is the US putting satellites in space to prevent Russia putting nukes in space or maybe we put nukes or lasers in space first.  It has nothing to do with aliens.

AskReddit,ffh3i37,t3_etksk1,1579922109.0,"I had a good job until one day I was in a lot of pain. I didn't get injured I just started having a lot of pain. I couldn't work or go out to socialize. Because I was stuck at home and I'm an extrovert at heart I became extremely depressed.  I had some close family members pass away so that didn't help things. I also had an uncle that I looked up to but he decided to join a cult and doesn't talk to use anymore.    

 2 years before the pain started I applied to be a State Trooper. I went through all the tests and was waiting for a call. It was my dream job. I wait  a total of 3 year but I finally got the call from the State Troopers saying I got accepted and they wanted me to go to the academy. Unfortunately I had to turn it down because I still didn't know what was causing my pain. 6 months later the doctors found I had a labral tear in my hip. I got it fixed only to have pain start on the other side. Sure enough I had a year in the other hip as well. It's 2012 and I'm doing PT to get better and my depression is doing better as well. I went water skiing with my wife for the first time in years and I was having a blast. Then I had a really bad crash and injured my back. I'm not paralyzed but I'm in a lot of pain again. Depression comes back even harder. My wife ends up leaving me. She said it's because she didn't like coming home not knowing if I was alive or dead.  

It's the present and I'm still stuck home in constant pain.  I still go to doctors all the time trying to get back to work. Finances are gone and I'm on welfare. I'm trying to get disability but have gotten denied twice. I really thought I had it last time. I got all my doctors to write a person letter stating why I deserve to get disability. Yet I still got denied. Third time's a charm. I just don't know where I'm going to come up with the money to get by until I get approved. My mom triez to help. She's 63 and is working overtime in order to get money for me. I feel horrible that she's doing that. She's worked all her life she deserves to be able to relax and spend money on what she wants.  If it wasn't for my dog (the only thing I wanted in the divorce) I probably would have killed myself a long time ago."

AskMen,ffh108w,t3_etktoe,1579920218.0,In my opinion if you look at your life and realise you would be better alone than with your SO it's probably a good idea to leave. If your SO brings the worst out of you it's a toxic relationship and you should get out.  You have kids so you really should try couples counseling. Give your relationship every chance to succeed. If your kids are hearing you fight all the time it also might be a good idea to call the relationship off. Your kids shouldn't have to live im that environment.

Your friend was trapped in a house that was on fire  and you kept telling her to walk out the door you just opened to save herself. Yet she goes to another door. So you go over to that door. It's closer to the flames but you open it and your friend turns and walks to another door. The third door is on fire so you open it for her and burn your hand. Again your friend turns and goes towards another door that is even hotter than the previous. Do you keep opening door burning more and more of yourself in the process or do you back up and call in the fire department?   I'm guessing you would call the fire department since your friend isn't willing to help herself. There is only so much you can do.  Maybe you can Try to find the number for the counselor at the University and give the number to your friend. You could go with her if she's nervous. I wouldn't go in the appointment with her just sit in the waiting room.

I have been depressed for a long time but I reached out for professional help. About a month of going to a counselor I realised I was putting my friends and family in the same position as your friend is putting you in. I felt like shit for doing that to them. If you do talk to her again and she starts to vent I recommend just saying ""I'm sorry you are going through all that. I'm not a counselor though. I wish I could but I can't help. Let's see if we can't find you a counselor that can help you feel better"".  Or something like that. If she is going to a university they have counselors right there on campus for free. It might be a good idea for you to talk to one and see what they recommend you do about your friend. I know it's hard but it sounds like she is hurting your mental health. When that happens your mental health comes first and you need to walk away.  I wish you all the best."
