""""Medical prescriptions have no impact on this world in themselves if people choose not to follow them.""

No my point was that you can describe the world in terms of what people want, how they act towards those wants, etc. (which are all subjective) and if you try to create objective moral rules that those don't add anything to the system.

""Since my utilitarianism grounded in hypothetical imperatives is based on people's actual desires, I don't think we actually need to care about the extreme long term. We can limit our view to policies that affect people in the near term and the here and now - which will tend to help fulfill people's strongest moral desires anyways."" I think I know where a lot of confusion stems from.. You're not actually defending utilitarianism.

""Determinism is the only way we can have moral responsibility."" You have argued that moral responsibility with a free (or random) will is just as unlikely, which I fully agree with. But as you know most people wouldn't call someone responsible in the classical sense if that person didn't have alternative options (which we don't in a deterministic system). You can call the process of holding someone accountable in the way you described 'moral responsibility' (and I fully agree that it can be useful to use shorthands like that for complex processes) but it's not the moral responsibility people usually talk about. They want it grounded in freedom to act and want.

""Do you think the proposition ""Objective truths don't exist"" is objectively true? If not, what kind of truth value does the proposition ""Objective truths don't exist"" have?"" great question, because obviously that's where it gets tricky. (Weird stuff like the Maddhyamaka-Buddhists 'tetralemma' regarding Sunyata come from this problem.) The statement 'there is no objective truth' gets the label 'true' in my specific (subjective) system of concepts, and because we roughly share the same concepts, system and methods of concept-combining if you follow the same steps as I did you will interpret that same statement (mini-system-of-concepts) roughly the same way. (I would like to just directly give you my whole moral and epistemological framework where this is all clearly outlined but I haven't yet translated it into english.)

""That aside, do you think that there is a world separate from our perceptions of it (even if we might never be able to know anything about it in principle)?"" I have the basic assumption that there is, which I do not intend to throw away because it does make for a more coherent and useful worldview. But this 'substance' or ding-an-sich is not something we can accurately grasp with our system 2 (Kahneman) reasoning because it necessarily works with discrete steps and therefor arbitrary distinctions (very useful tho)."

If there is no objective morality (as it looks like to me, zero proof and I have searched a lot..) then we don't just assume it because we think the world will be 'better' (according to what exactly?). But why wouldn't we say 'murder is bad' if 'bad' is meant in a way like 'this is something I do not want to happen to me, so I'm spreading the meme that this 'should' not happen', and of course a lot of people don't want to be murdered so 'murder is bad' becomes an intersubjective rule.

slatestarcodex,ffn2s9e,t1_ffmsbud,1580061397.0,"I am going to label the problems to discuss by numbers so it's easy to reference them:

1. I don't believe in objective truths, nor objective concepts. Where do concepts reside other than the mind? And if you learn someone a concept differently or change a neuron here and there what is there to tell that person his concept is wrong other than the concepts of others? (And sometimes in-built preferences for interconnected stimuli, as the Gestalt-movement in psychology has studied extensively, and coherency with other concepts, etc. etc.). There is no 'platonic blueprint' to be found, how a concept should be. When you learn a neural network to differentiate between cats and dogs (or random other not-yet-labelled possible ways to dsitinguise input) is it 'in touch with dogness and catness as objective concepts'? Of course not.

2. Earlier problem still stands. Your 'ought' doesn't describe what we'd call morality (because morality is about interactions between individuals and not how one individual follows his/her own desires) and there is no 'rule' that logically explains why individuals have to follow group-oughts. (And again, these things are all just itnersubjective, not objective)

3. All consequentialist ethics have the problem of deciding where to stop counting the effects of an action in time and space (to decide if an action is good or bad, for the moral calculus). Do you stop at an arbitrary point (making your ethics obviously not objective) or do you let it go on forever making it impossible (and meaningless) to decide (chaos theory, you don't know how an action in our chaotic system effects future generations for example, and possibly infinite happiness minus infinite suffering is...?).

4. Moral rules have no impact on this world in themselves if people choose not to follow them. If the world can be described just as well without them.. Occams razor does a snip-snip.

5. Determinism yeets free will away and with it the classic idea of moral responsibity.

6. You should read Nietzsche."

With your terminology you can say what the group 'ought' to do and what the individual 'ought' to do but not that the individual 'ought' to satisfy the needs of the group."

I still completely agree with this ""But my entire point here is that mental phenomenon develop and cohere in response to reality, and that concepts can be evaluated and reevaluated not only against the concepts of others but also against the empirical and rational facts that give rise to them in the first place."" (I would fill in 'consistent stimuli' for empirical facts) But where we diverge is that you think in terms of objectively right and wrong, impying there is a direct link between concepts and 'substance', and I think it's more about having a coherent system that is consistent with the stimuli from the outside world (that it correlates with it in some way is the assumption).

""They are wrong because their conception of sickness is simply wrong - it fails to accurately represent the thing in the world it claims to. When every human being on Earth believed in some form of spiritual causation for sickness, we were all still wrong.""
If that what causes the concept of 'sickness' to be triggered is assumed a spiritual cause which cannot be demonstrated then obviously the system of concepts interpreting what causes sickness is less coherent with the input from the outside world than one that knows 'how it really is'. I'm saying the same thing as you do without needing concepts to be outside the mind. It just becomes more of a hassle..(And for me using concepts as if they are objective is a shorthand.)

""as opposed to being universally valid regardless of content."" I wouldn't call all viewpoints valid, because I'd use 'valid' as a shorthand for 'coherent (with itself and the information from the outside)'. ""What if my conception of evidence permits intuitions like that? It seems to me that you are assuming grounds for discourse and thought that you then use to argue against their foundations."" Again, coherency/consistency.

I think our views actually do not differ all that much, except that you secretly still put concepts outside of the mind (which I try really hard to prevent, it seems to be hard-wired)."

""Would incels still exist as a subculture if there were ways to decrease or eliminate libido?"" Yes, incels exist as a result of loneliness, bitterness, coping mechanisms for failing in life, etc. Not just no sex.

philosophy,fdjzhyu,t1_fdic8m7,1578492218.0,"Well if you don't believe that concepts exist outside of the mind what do you believe? Because obviously the mind is changable, relative, subjective. All comonalities seem to be because of intersubjectivity, not objectivity (if the mind is changable, relative, etc. then there is no 'perfect way' to structure the mind. There is no measuring stick.).

And why do you think it's weird what the process behind knowing is? Obviously 'just knowing' won't do because people are often very certain that they know something while the knowledge of multiple people can be conflicting, so either you do away with 'certainty leads to objective knowledge' or you do away with the base-assumption that we live in a shared world. You don't strike me as the type for the second option.

(Also I did formulate an alternative in my previous comment..)

And here's another issue, imagine Carthesian doubt is 'the method to find what's not certain truth'. Descartes never doubted his own method of finding truth. How for example would you prove 'reasoning' is a valid method without using reasoning and creating a circular argument which is an incorrect method to find truth according to that same reasoning?

Furthermore, if you've read a couple of philosophers you should know that ""it's obvious"" is usually what follows after something that they can't prove... Let me try it another way, how we're seeing seems obvious from the first-person perspective but can you tell me how the occipital cortex works precisely?

So no, ""how it works"" is not a strange question at all, and I think you're dodging it because you suspect that if you try to answer then you'll discover it is a lot more subjective than you'd like it to be."

philosophy,fdi8dpn,t1_fdhehtw,1578437570.0,"Just because truth is subjective doesn't mean anthing goes. We have a system of concepts (mostly intersubjectively agreed upon) that accepts or rejects other smaller systems of concepts (claims, sentences, texts) = seeing it as truth or false (if it is coherent (and can follow from) your system of concept knowns as your worldview)). And because we roughly see the same group of stimuli as the same concepts claims about the world are often agreed upon. And I think we can assume we share the same world.. Of course it's more complicated than this but you kinda get the point.

What exactly is the mechanism for seeing something as truth when you see the mind not as a subjective system but in touch with abstract concepts? How could that work?"

philosophy,fdh8w78,t1_fdh71ow,1578417920.0,"How are thoughts necessarily 'about' something? Where does the intentionality come from? To me it just seems that certain concepts are triggered by certain stimuli, the idea of 'intentionality' as pointing outwards into the world is an ill fit. What of course is actually meant is that we 'feel our concepts', we are conscious. And sure, the hard problem remains unsolved as far as I know, but that doesn't say anything necessarily about the subjectivity of concepts.

I am not trying to string you into a meaningless conversation with the following exercise, please try it: Try describing what EXACTLY makes an oak tree an oak tree. What DNA must an oak tree have? Or is it about the shape? Or the colours? etc. etc.
What I'm getting at is that you will be trying to make a precise definition based on a vague concept of what an oak tree is, instead of basing your concept on a precise definition. And you can imagine that there are cultures where an oak tree is just part of a larger 'tree concept', or 'plant concept'. Or that the roots are counted as part of the ground isntead of the tree. Or whatever else you can come up with (which won't go smoothly because of the way we view stimuli that stick together as one object=concept). Concepts are learned. And they can be learned differently, and there is no 'ultimate concept' that is the measurement-stick for when it is right or wrong."
