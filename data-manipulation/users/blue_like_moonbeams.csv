40kLore,ffh4aq1,t1_ffgtrzh,1579922729.0,"The covers of Horus Rising,  A Thousand Sons, and Prospero Burns were my first exposure to the setting. I was 10 or so, and I just loved these cool, weird-looking fighty space soldiers with big guns and bigger pauldrons.  
  
There's something special about older HH covers, I feel like. The newer ones tend to look nicer, but they're polished and flashy and don't have as much of that weighty old-school feel. It's hard to explain, but it's kinda like they're focusing more on the characters instead of the setting."
40kLore,ffh39bj,t3_etjvix,1579921918.0,"Hmm. Bit of a multi-parter here.  
The first I ever tried was *Legion of the Damned*, but I just couldn't get past the first couple pages. First proper read was *Ciaphas Cain: The Greater Good*.    
    
While these days I can definitely pick up on the Cain books' grimdark elements, the impression I got then was of a fairly conventional scifi setting. Though I was as disappointed as I am now that there wasn't an Imperial/Tau team up.  
  
Ultimately, the book that really drew me in was *Gaunt's Ghosts: First and Only*. I think what I liked most about it was the way it filled the same niche Star Wars did when I was younger."

DMAcademy,ffaw7z4,t3_esc0wa,1579745925.0,"For context, I've completely redone the Yuan-Ti in my setting so that they're just another normal, civilized race. The issue? They aren't the blessed followers of a benevolent serpent-god like the vast majority of people believe - they're the remnants of horrifying experiments carried out on human prisoners of an ancient Aboleth civilization. The deity they worship is a total fiction created by their first emperor to stabilize his rule after the Aboleths were cast down by the real gods.   
  
While completely true, this isn't a very widespread theory, only believed by those who have delved too greedily and too deep into the forgotten places of the world. Even among those intrepid folk it is spoken of only in hushed whispers, as the leadership of the Serapsiran Empire has every interest in preventing the reveal of so terrible a truth - with their own fangs, if need be..."

DndAdventureWriter,fegtt0e,t3_eoxyhw,1579102373.0,"This might be a bit of a cop-out, but maybe you could just leave the Patin Litigus to the necromancer and have the party defend his laboratory while it gets attacked by, for instance, local villagers lead by a pack of Wolfir.  
  
Or maybe have the party go on a quest to retrieve the special components the necromancer needs because he's working on an angel. Like a certain amount of blood from a Silverfur to quench the metal in so he can use its connection with Avacyn to corrupt the skaab's divine nature, the egg of a Gitrog Monster to brew a joint-lubricant potion that makes the skaab easier to control, etc. Might be a bit similar to the first task, but I see this as more of a Witcher-style monster hunt instead of just farming npcs.

Yes, that's pretty much what I'm saying. I'm into the cantrip and bounce part, but the way he's so pushed just doesn't sit right with my inner hipster. He's honestly my ideal general, but he's a little too perfect for me to actually want to build him.
