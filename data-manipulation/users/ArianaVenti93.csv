>Now, your average Brit had as much knowledge of Parliament then as we do of day-to-day life in the 1750s, so this might need a little unpacking. You see, it’s all to do with calendars—the way we tabulate time—and how Britain fell out of sync with the world, and felt the need to catch back up.

And I tell you what, some of the cuts are seamless and you can’t tell what the natural flow of conversation is. 

From what I understand though, and funnily enough they’ve done to this interview, is she was saying that she rated Corbyn the person 10/10, for being a kind and principled politician etc, but he was savaged by the media from day one. Labour didn’t do enough to rebut conservative and media smearing against Corbyn/Labour and the party need to get behind the next leader and help build and shape their image in the media.

Because you’re a home (not you personally) they cannot turn your power off. So when your contract expires, they can’t just cut you off as a means of saying “it’s time to renew!” So they stick you on a more expensive tariff in the hopes that people don’t realise and forget they need to get in touch. They thrive on the idea of people not contacting them but have an obligation to remind you it’s time to renew. If you contact them mid contract saying you’re planning to switch and the other company is willing to pay your exit fees if there are any, they’ll try and cut you a slight cheaper rate.

The fact that you’re forced to pay for something that you feel you need to avoid using when needed is a sham itself."
CasualUK,fchvvbc,t1_fchovad,1577654747.0,"Jon Richardson got me thinking, when he said he puts 10€ in his wallet instead of a condom. We should keep a few of our preferred tea bags in our wallets. Have it next to our medical card (if you have one) so that when I come to in hospital, they know what cuppa will awaken my senses."

FantasyPL,fccl91c,t1_fcc18d6,1577599695.0,"I’m crying because I’ve just swapped Robbo for VVD. Other than TAAs freak game, they were on similar points. VVD is 600k cheaper than Robbo, 900k than TAA, which freed me up to get Maddison over Grealish. 

I’ve watched a lot of Leicester recently and I just do not rate Chilwell defensively. He gets rinsed so easily, so often. Liverpool and TAA capitalised on that gap and Chilwell’s inability to close down cuts inside. Chilwell is a decent FPL asset but not a great defender at all."

CasualUK,fc9oxm8,t1_fc8w7w5,1577555959.0,"You’re mentally untuned (I won’t diagnose you with anything) not suffering from insomnia. You probably fall asleep after “giving up” because you’re not overworking your brain trying to sleep. 

Maybe before you lie down, tell yourself “I’m just going to lie down for a little bit” and just enjoy lying there. As long as you’re not restless, you’ll find you’ll drift off more naturally. 

If you still feel restless, don’t get mad, just get up and go do something without thinking about it, give the kitchen tops a quick wipe down, bleach the sinks. Anything slightly productive you can do subconsciously. Still not sleepy? Hop back in to bed and and read, but preferably not from a screen, even if dim-lit. 

Oh, and try not play video games or watch stimulating TV up to an hour before you plan to sleep. The flashing lights etc are stimuli to your brain. 

Circadian rhythm is a thing and something you should look at. We have a natural body clock and if you’re accustomed to falling asleep at 5-6am for sometime, it’ll become your pseudo natural clock. Try bring it back in instalments. You fell asleep at 5am this morning? Tomorrow try make that 4-4:30am but don’t work yourself up if you don’t get to sleep before then. 

Lastly, you sound a bit down, mentally. What you described is typical in depression. If you’re in a position to seek support, do so."
