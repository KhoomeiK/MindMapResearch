changemyview,fgndeu4,t1_fgnbf4s,1580942507.0,"I would say this is more to do with reddit's growing popularity. Reddit has become much more ""main stream"" in recent years and has led to a larger and broader userbase on here. As things become more broad, people tend to stop caring about the community as a whole and look at only a subcommunity (basically just a collection of subreddits instead of caring about r/all).

Look at youtube for example. Back in say 2010, most people who browsed youtube could look at a list of the top 10 most known youtubers and recognize most of them if not all of them. Nowadays, you can't even recognize them if you remove all the VEVO and celebrity accounts. That was the main issue with youtube rewind, most people just don't even know all of these big youtubers anymore because youtube covers sucha broader audience at this point. Now when you go on youtube, you recognize mainly just the people you like in your subcommunity. If you're into pop educational videos, you probably know vsauce, numberphile, veritasium, sam o'nella, etc. However, you probably don't know channels like whinderssonnunes (38+ million subs), Kids Diana Show (45+ million subs), or Felipe Neto (36+ million subs). They're MUCH larger channels, but they don't fit what you like so you don't care to follow them and youtube knows not to recommend them to you.

I'm not saying this is exactly how you feel about reddit, it sounds like you still want to see all these different subreddits, but the majority of redditors nowadays do not and that's what led to these kinds of rules that you're advocating against being put in place. If you're on r/AskHistorians, where each comment is expected to be heavily cited, you probably don't want to deal with ""the rest of the outside community"" coming in and not following your sub's rules. This is especially the case with subs that have beef with each other (I won't name subs, but you specifically mentioned subs that only add flairs by race/sex/gender/etc. and this is why).

The ratio is then ((4/3)pi\*r^(3))/(4pi\*r^(2)) which reduces to (1/3)r or r/3. Therefore, as the radius of a sphere increases, the ratio becomes larger and larger.

Now lets look at a cube. The volume of a cube is x^(3) and the SA is 6x^(2). Therefore the ration is x^(3)/(6x^(2)) or x/6, so again this holds true.

math,fggkath,t3_eyc7x8,1580763640.0,I generally will mention the kinds of questions that are asked instead of answering how it's solved.
learnmath,fgez2s6,t1_fge9902,1580715976.0,"I don't really have a flat out answer to give, but I can tell you my situation and it might help. In high school, I got A's and B's in my math classes, but never did any math tournament things. In college, I started as a finance major and swapped to pure math. When I was a pure math major, I took an elective called ""discrete math."" That class was the hardest math class I'd ever taken and four years into my degree now is still the 2nd hardest I've taken considering how much I knew at the time. Our exams were 6 questions with 3 hours to complete them and several people couldn't finish in time. We would work in groups for our homework with 10+ people in the library looking at the problems in just utter confusion. But through all of this, there were people who just *got it*. They'd look at the homework, instantly knew what to do, and finish it in 30 minutes. They'd take the exams and be done in half that time. Once we even asked one of those people to help us with our homework and when we couldn't solve one of the steps, he downright refused to help because of how basic it was to him. So in my position, coming from a different major being in my first real math class looked at this and just though ""What the actual fuck? How are people this good at math?"" It's pretty god damn demoralizing at times. It makes you realize just how little you understand about math. 

However, as I've gone through my degree, I've realized how little it is about just being good at math and more about how long people have been learning math. Those people who saw that class as a walk in the park were far into their degrees. It was an elective, so anyone from seniors to freshmen were in that class. When you've gone through at least four years of complex math, of course parts of it are going to look easier and easier. You start to realize ways around problems that you wouldn't have considered long ago. You get trained to look outside the box in more and more ways. 

Last year, I took a Linear Algebra class. This class is generally something people take towards the beginning of their degree, but was something I put off for a bit. I was a bit worried going into the class because I had heard it was so difficult. However, going into it, it was extremely easy for me. At first, I thought it was just because I had a good professor, but then I saw several students struggling to understand concepts like eigenvectors and bases. I realized I had slowly become those students that seemed like they knew everything (not that I actually do, just that I know my past self would be confused at the shit I do now) and realized that it's something you just improve at. And those people that seem to just ""get it"" never go away. There's always people that know so much more than you, but it's something to take in stride to focus on getting to that point instead of being intimidated by it.

In total, N=3 has 9:27 or 1:3 odds.

I show these two to make it easier to get a more intuitive way of seeing it and see the pattern to order it (run down all the options with each row) so you know you get every option. It makes combinatorics a lot easier in general. Also, I didn't show it because it's too big, but [N=4 is 39:81 or 13:27 odds.](https://i.imgur.com/sDvkKqr.png)

Let's step back for a second. For N=4, when I make a list of all the numbers, can't I just make 3 columns for each value and say ""hey all the values from N=3 still work here (excluding RRR, SSS, and PPP), so I can just add this value 3 times""? We can! So we'll take our last total amount of ties, subtract 3, and then multiply by 3. So far, we've got 3(t-3). We also know the trivial cases of RR...RR, SS...SS, and PP...PP will be in every single one, so we can add 3 to our formula too. Now we've got 3(t-3) + 3, which we can reduce to just 3t-6. However, there will also be some new ones. In that case, we need to find the likelihood that only 2 values are satisfied so we know it'll be satisfied once we add another set of values. For there to NOT be only 2 values would mean we've already counted it because it's either all one value or all three values. So then we just add all the values that were NOT a tie, which is 3^(N-1)\-t. We use 3^(N-1) because that's how many possible games there were with one less player (since we're trying to find what it'll be when we add a player). Now our total amount of ties is 3t - 6 + 3^(N-1) \- t, which is reduced to 2t - 6 + 3^(N-1). However, you asked for the odds. There are a total of 3^(N) games with N players, so that's simply (2t - 6 + 3^(N-1))/3^(N).

Now we can just leave it there, but honestly, that formula is kind of ugly. It requires you know not just the odds of the last game, but the amount of ties in it, so I'm gonna spruce it up a bit so we just have to know the odds. Our odds from our last game would be t/3^(N-1) and we'll call this value x\[N-1\]. We can split our formula to be 2t/(3(3^(N-1))) - 6/3^(N) \+1/3. Plug in our x\[N-1\] and we get that x\[N\] = (2/3)x\[N-1\] - 6/3^(N) \+1/3. We could also generate a function that is not based on an original N value (this requires N=2 and N=3 are 1/3 to plug anything in), but honestly I forgot how to do that. Maybe another person who has taken a discrete or combinatorics class can fill in that part.

**TL;DR:** Your function is x\[N\] = (2/3)x\[N-1\] - 6/3^(N) \+1/3

**Edit:** missed the part about if everyone chooses something to counter each other and fixed my math. That part made it a much more fun problem ;)

**Edit 2:** added an image for N=4 in case anyone wanted to see it. I always keep note cards on my desk in case I need to write out any math."

AskHistorians,fg2svx6,t3_ewjzya,1580454505.0,"The thing is that Fascism was originally based on the idea of trying to come up with a 3rd alternative to Capitalism and Communism. Globally at the time around the the early 1900s, there was a large question of ""which is better, Capitalism or Communism?"" The Fascist movement began as a way to avoid the problems of both Capitalism and Communism. Capitalism was seen as giving the people too much power and partly blamed for the current economy. Communism was seen as the opposite, giving the government too much power. To combat this, Fascism aimed to only *partly* control the economy. Capitalism lets the market control itself and Communism has the government control the market. Fascism aimed to have the government control the private businesses, but then those businesses acted on their own accord. From a purely fundamental standpoint, all three are different from each other. In fact, in Mein Kampf, Hitler constantly mocks both capitalists and communists. They were seen as lesser since they weren't following their amazing new idea.

However, in actual cases of Fascist governments, we know that they are not completely different. Economically, they may have different policies, but politically, they were much closer to Communist governments. To have a government take control of the economy, even partly, still requires a lot of power for the government, leading to a much more totalitarian government. This is why Fascism is generally associated with racism and nationalism. These are both great ways to gain power. However, when comparing Communist countries and Fascist ones, Fascist countries are much more likely to push for war because war is great for business, especially in their style of economy.

As for what you said about people comparing Capitalism and Communism to Fascism, this is because Fascism is like a weird mix of the two. If you support one and oppose the other, you can easily cherry-pick traits of Fascism to say one is closer to the other, but roughly all three hate each other."

It's a bit hard to give advice without knowing where to start and where to stop. There's [quite a few](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) formulas on pi, so we can't just go over *all*  of them.

When I teach students about pi though, I try to make it clear what pi actually *is*, because most people just don't know what it is. When you have a square (let's say it has a length of x), the perimeter is equal to 4\*x because it's made up of 4 sides with the same length. Then old ass mathematicians were like ""alright so can we find some multiplier for circles too?"" The answer is yes! All you do is you take the circle's length (or its *diameter*, literally just a fancy word for length that we only use for circles) and multiply it by pi, therefore the **formula for circumference** is pi\*d or pi\*2\*r (since diameter = 2\*radius). If I have a string that is the length of a circle's diameter, I need to use that piece of string exactly pi amount of times to wrap it completely around the circle. This becomes important for tire makers, 3D printing, etc. where you need to know just how much of your materials you need to use for make stuff. *Random side fun fact about pi.

Ramsay only says one is at the top, not both, referring to just the top third.

What Remmie is doing is she is trying to cut at a 90 degree angle on this line (this line btw is called the tangent line) so that it looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/D2IY6JG.png). Now the top of a sphere is pretty arbitrary, after all, you can just rotate it a bit and call that your new top, so this same logic can be applied to the rest of the onion to make it look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/kYNVc6I.png) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/Q7N85DS.png) (again, not drawn to perfect angles, but you get the idea). 

> By following the curvature of the onion, I agree that the outer layer will be consistent size (although you don't show this.) However, the inner layer will deductively be smaller. The center of the sphere is smaller than than the outside in whatever possible universe. 

I'm a bit confused on what you mean by this. I think you mean that the smaller circle inscribed in the onion shouldn't match the angle of the outer circle. First remember that the circle I've explained up till now has no given length. I haven't said anything about how big this circle is, just that it's a circle. In fact, this is an *arbitrary* circle, so whatever circle I look at, this will hold true for it. To explain this more intuitively, we can both agree that [the tops of these circles both have a slope equal to zero](https://i.imgur.com/gzb1iQz.png). We can then agree that [this red line is at a 90 degree angle to both lines](https://i.imgur.com/cBtRRfl.png), right? There is a 90 degree angle both above and below the lines. Therefore, the angle is the same for both of these angles. Applying the same logic that we did with the first circle with rotating it, we can get back to [this](https://i.imgur.com/TZOgDP8.png). If this still doesn't quite make sense, you probably have taken a geometry class and have heard the axiom that if a line passes through two parallel lines, the angles it makes on both lines will be the same [like so](https://i.imgur.com/YkT99f7.png). Getting back to what we were talking about with onions, the red lines indicate the angle that you cut at. The blue lines show how they truly do cut at the same angle and that these angles are 90 degrees.

Or by that statement are you referring to the fact that due to cutting towards a single point, each onion bit will be a smaller size due to its small circumference? The answer is yes and no. In terms of our hypothetical onion, yes this small difference would be very noticeable. In an actual onion though, I don't believe the size difference is all that much with how many cuts Remmie uses in the video (11 cuts) and how large the innermost ring is. Our hypothetical onion goes on infinitely and has no innermost ring, but a real onion stops eventually. [Yellow onions especially don't have many rings](https://i.imgur.com/EdO70Nu.png), so the offset wouldn't be very much, but this can vary obviously with each onion. [Here is a grid overlay on top of a red onion slice](https://imgur.com/a/lsjSBlt). On this grid, it gets really vague as to what fits a ""consistent size."" For example, do [these little spots](https://i.imgur.com/siEGLUQ.png) count towards what's considered ""consistent size?"" If you want a ""mathematical"" way to find a consistent size, you could find the average size and its standard deviation. To measure that though, you'd need to get some tools and a bunch of onions. That's where we leave the statisticians. Eyeballing it though, I'd say Remmie's method still remains most consistent in size and shape. The size difference is so small though, that Ramsay's or Remmie's methods will work (assuming you're only going for size and not shape)."
learnmath,ffrekm6,t3_euqtmr,1580156493.0,"[Lets look at a single halved onion ring to see what happens in each method.](https://i.imgur.com/LEHqUyK.png) You can see more intuitively that Remmie's is the most consistent in both size and shape while option 3 is the least consistent. If you want to think of it more mathematically, this is because each cut that Remmie does is perpendicular to the curvature of the onion. By doing this, each onion bit will have four 90 degree angles. By cutting at the same angle every time, you won't have the same angle with every onion bit, so they'll be less consistent. The additional parallel cuts are to make the size more consistent, which is why Remmie's method doesn't need them."

learnmath,fenhj03,t3_eq2khm,1579284815.0,"Terms you should know:

* Unit Circle = a circle with a radius of 1 | You've probably seen [this](http://rebeccasnidermath.weebly.com/uploads/2/5/0/6/25064391/header_images/1385589856.jpg) in a pre-calculus class or college algebra class. It's important to have it completely memorized (as much as I hate saying that) because most professors expect that by the time you enter the class and will bring it up a lot. If you don't have it memorized or you're struggling to understand it, here a [gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Circle_cos_sin.gif) that makes it easier to understand how it relates to sine and cosine. In the unit circle image link, the x value is your cosine value and the y value is your sine value when you plug in that angle or radian.
* Radian = another form of finding angles, used in units of pi | Radians and degrees go together like miles and kilometers. Both can be the same thing and converted to the other. Remember, pi is the ratio between a circle and its diameter. Basically, if I have a string that is the length of the diameter of a circle, I will need pi of those strings to wrap around the whole circle. Because a unit circle has a radius of 1, then the diameter is 2. 2\*pi is 2pi, so our unit circle has a circumference of 2pi. What radians measure is how far along the circumference we've moved. If it's a 90 degree angle, then I've moved 1/4th of the circumference. 2pi/4=pi/2, so 90 degrees = pi/2.
* Unit Square = a square with a ""radius"" of 1 | unit squares (or unit \[insert shape here\]) don't really get brought up much besides circles, however sometimes they do and I've seen people get confused by the term when they see it.
* Sine = opposite/hypotenuse | gotta remember your SOH CAH TOA
* Cosine = adjacent/hypotenuse
* Tangent = opposite/adjacent
* Inverse = whatever would cancel out the opposite | you've probably seen stuff like a/b is the inverse of b/a. You'll see inverse sine and such in calculus. just remember that inverse is always used to cancel out the other one, so inverse sine cancels out sine.
* Normal = perpendicular | This isn't one you should be expected to know, but some professors (like yours) probably will mention it anyway. If they say ""the normal line"" or ""the line normal to this line"" they just mean a perpendicular line.

Terms you'll learn/hear a lot:

* Continuous = the line doesn't have any gaps or anything like that | If you look at the graph y=1/x or y=tan(x), you'll see the graph has these moments that have these little gaps or jumps in them. These functions are *not* continuous. However, graphs like y=2x or y=x^(2) are continuous because there's no jumps or gaps.
* Discontinuous = not continuous | y=1/x and y=tan(x) are discontinuous because they are not continuous.
* Infinitesimal = really really itsy bitsy bit that is infinitely small | I feel like people mostly say this word to sound smarter. They just mean that it's so small/close together that you wouldn't be able to see it, even if you zoomed in forever. There's a more complicated explanation, but honestly if you're not going into higher math, it doesn't matter.
* Limit = the value the line approaches | Let's say I give you y = 2x and I ask you to tell me what y is when x = 3. Well 2\*3=6, so the answer is 6. That's the limit when x = 3. However, this gets a bit harder if I have some gaps in my graph. Let's say there is no y value for x = 3. There can still be a limit though, because we don't care about the y value *at* 3, we just care about the y value *around* 3, so in this case, the limit will still be 6. You'll learn more about this in class, it's a bit harder to explain through just text.
* ""rate of change"" = slope | you'll be doing a lot of stuff involving the phrase ""rate of change"" like finding an equation for rate of change. All it is is an equation for slope and everything is about finding slope.
* Derivative = equation for slope for a specific equation | If you're trying to find the slope at a specific point, you just plug the x value into the derivative and bam you've got your slope at that point.
* Anti-derivative = integral = opposite of a derivative, finds the area under the line when graphed | Lets say I give you the equation y = 2x and then have you graph it. Using the integral, you can find the area under that line. Sometimes you're giving bounds, sometimes you aren't.
* Bounds = uhh... bounds? | To expand on the last one, if I want you to find the area under that line from x=2 to x=4, then 2 and 4 are the bounds."

learnmath,fej2yjs,t3_epc7np,1579154939.0,"I actually have a problem with chronic pain in my dominant arm and I'm a math major, so I know your situation all too well. First off, I recommend seeking both a pain specialist and a pain therapist. A pain specialist helps with meds that significantly lessen the pain and (hopefully) can find the cause. A pain therapist is good for improving dealing with the pain when you're hurting a lot and genuinely has helped a lot for me. One example is how stress is generally makes my pain a lot worse and being in pain is obviously stressful, so learning how to end that cycle is really important. You may also want to ask your doctor about their thoughts on a physical therapist if that's something they think would help your situation.

As for the math part, I've learned to get better at understanding the reasoning behind things instead of the steps. Losing use of your dominant arm forces you to think a lot more so you don't have to use your arm as much. Because of this, you want to improve your ability to ""think"" essentially. The better you get at things like critical thinking, the less strenuous it is for you to think out a problem and thus the less you have to actually write down to figure out a problem.

I personally hate pens in general, but pens are actually really nice for the fact that you don't have to put as much pressure on them to write. You should also work on pressing lighter when writing in general. I noticed when my arm hurts, I tend to press even harder and grip the pen/pencil tighter, which just makes things worse. You have to mentally remind yourself to relax your hand a bit and it makes it a lot easier.

I'll get with a friend, talk out a problem with them, and then they can write the steps. As long as I actually know what to do instead of just agreeing with what they say, I'm good."

You said you haven't gotten an MRI so it's unclear what you have. An MRI would show dementia and if your doctor doesn't want to give you one, tell him you want it anyway. At the very least, just say you want to do it ""just to be safe."" As someone who constantly goes to the doctors, doctors don't care about patients asking for something different and if anything, are usually just trying to avoid making you waste money. Your doctor probably thinks he has enough information to be able to know you don't have dementia (which may be the case, you don't need a test to prove everything) and doesn't want to make you waste your money on an MRI if he already knows what the result will be. If you tell him you want to be safe, then you'll know for sure what your situation is instead of thinking you have dementia if you don't. Having dementia is a big deal and isn't a ""I'll think about weather or not I'll get it checked"" situation."
