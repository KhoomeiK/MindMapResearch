If I remember correctly this is how it was conceived, and it's because of the way low-level mapping of memory addresses work.

For instance, if I define an array at memory address 100, the first item is at 100, the second at 101, etc.  That is, the locations of the items in the array can be described as memoryAddress + offset, where the first item has an offset of 0.
