harrypotter,ff3atxk,t1_ff36m5c,1579537585.0,"I suppose the howling wolf image can equally well be interpreted as a howling dog or as the grim, but yeah, I don't think these are separate images. 

(the 'hidden dementor' seems like a perfectly straightforward image of a dementor that doubles as the wolf/dog's tooth, but I guess it can also be seen as a tree?)"
harrypotter,ff391qt,t1_ff37p4c,1579536553.0,"Yeah, the howling wolf is very clearly intentional, but I'm not buying the dog add a separate image at all - too odd and squished and jaw-less to be the artist's plan."
doctorwho,ff2zfsh,t1_ff2yyvd,1579529491.0,Always wished they'd included that scene.  Very beautiful little epilogue.

harrypotter,feamhsg,t3_eoa8wc,1578950294.0,"Bit of googling about suggests jinx, hex, and curse are all harmful spells in ascending order from least harmful/least malicious (jinx) to most harmful and dangerous (curse). 

I recall seeing Charms referenced in some other thread as spells that alter the characteristics of the target in some way, (such as causing it to fly).  I suppose it's also implied charms are not meant to be harmful!

ETA: No idea if it's ever been cleared up officially!"

Some say the world will end in fire,

Some say in ice.

From what I’ve tasted of desire

I hold with those who favor fire.

But if it had to perish twice,

I think I know enough of hate

To say that for destruction ice

Is also great

And would suffice.

Also, can I just say how amazing it is that you got married wearing spider webs, black roses, and the Millennium Falcon?    You seem like one seriously kick-ass bride!"

It was definitely one that grew on me little by little by little!"
