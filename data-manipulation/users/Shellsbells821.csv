He ended up getting them to take a home equity loan out on the house (it was paid off and they lived there 45 years) he ended up selling all dads tools, moms jewelry. Anything of value. Always needed money to payoff people so they don't kill him. Money for lawyers, meth program ($40 each per day even after I told her it was free since  they were on state). They got state money and bought all kinds of candy and sweets and ate all mom's food. Mom also made excuses for him ""he needs help"" long story short...the house was foreclosed on. He ruined 2 of their cars. Let the drug dealers take them.  Dad passed away and mom ended up owing 65k on the loan after foreclosure. She's 88 and now living with my older brother. The nephew and wife? Long gone and never looked back. There's a reason these people are in the trouble they are."
