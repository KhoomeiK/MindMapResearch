A question: there's probably animals in those parts (wolves, bears?). How do you weigh the risks of camping in the wild and are you usually armed ?"

Paranormal,ff6m5xt,t3_ert9cn,1579630152.0,"I had an Assamese friend who was different, mildly speaking. He had problems with metal- any metal object he touched would spark. This dude also knew stuff before they'd actually happen ( he told a friend he'd lose his wallet, happened sane day) and his confidence was scary. 

Dude used to post conversations with some entity on his Facebook wall.i don't remember much but it was unbelievably freaky. He once held some sort of seance using a bowl filled with wine and a candle. There were three others who sat in a circle and apparently they saw a hand reach out through the flame. Now each one saw it differently, because they were seated around. I feel tempted to ask one of them to refresh my memory. We'll be meeting over drinks. Lemme come back to this thread."
