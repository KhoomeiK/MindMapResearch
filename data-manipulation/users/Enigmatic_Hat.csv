Seriously tho a trillion is a lot.  Think about how much space an adult tree takes up, including the clear space it needs around it.  Then think of how much space the average human claims in order to live and work.  And we’ve pretty much blanketed the most fertile land on the planet.

Multiply the human population by 100x and you still don’t have a trillion.  Would you be willing to give up the land you live on to be replaced by 100 trees?  Do you even have, or rent, that much land?  Seriously, a trillion is a LOT.  If we didn’t have the land to give back to the American Indians, we most certainly don’t have the fertile land it would take to make trees the new dominant species on the planet.

HyruleWarriors,ff6552g,t3_eovn1q,1579619369.0,"Most levels have only one or two ways you can lose.  For example many levels have as the loss condition losing an allied hero or the allied base... with said hero IN the allied base.  Meaning as long as you’re at the base its almost impossible to lose and you can wait out all the various enemy waves.  Likewise many missions that require you to go on the offensive have no allied base.  Remember, if an ally isn’t marked by a white flag on the map, you can win even if they die.  Likewise enemies you have to kill will have a special symbol next to their name, any other enemy you can win with them still alive. The minimap is very bad at explaining things but if you click through the pause menu you’ll see the game tells you everything in ridiculous detail.

In terms of the actual combat: block.  Block early, block often.  There are a few giant bosses that punish it but against all other enemies blocking makes you almost invincible.  In fact you can hold down block and spam dodge at the same time.  If you’re going to die, run away.  Get hearts by breaking red pots, cutting grass, and killing outpost captains.  Get the potion badges and the +healing badges.  

Basically, this is a time management game, not a true fighting game.  Focus only on whatever is most likely to make you lose.  If the most likely condition for losing is your own death, fight super cowardly.  If the most likely loss condition is losing a keep or captain, be there.  If you can’t beat an enemy but you have time, go around breaking yellow and green pots to build up you special and magic meters.  There’s no rule you can’t kill an enemy entirely with special attacks.

Finally, if you really can’t beat a stage buy levels for your hero until you can.  Its the only big rupee dump in the entire game, there’s no reason to save large amounts of money except to spend it on training."

news,fe9jvqw,t1_fe8rnra,1578938423.0,"Its more complicated than that.  NYC regulated cabs to reduce the number of cars on the road.  Because driving in NYC is and was miserable.  Its the same reason they can charge huge fees for driving a car into the city.  The point isn’t to make money, the point is to encourage people to use public transit instead of cars.  AFAIK the city never gouged people for money over the medallions, the million dollar medallions were sold privately.  Now Uber sidesteps the regulation by being a “ridesharing” app instead of a taxi service, and suddenly NYC roads are super congested.  Who would have thought lol.
Don’t get me wrong, the above is criticism of Uber, not a defense.  I’m more defending the original regulations.  If the city government had closed the loophole with Uber their system would still be working.  Same as how their shitty labor practices wouldn’t work if states would make labor laws that protect “consultants” (or at least clarify that an employee that works for you indefinitely many hours a week is by definition not a consultant but rather a normal employee)."
