The current political situation looks bad on a macro level, but just living there, it's not something that bothers most people.

I left in March 2019, lost my job (company was heavy on exports to the EU, and cut staff in anticipation of no deal) and abandoned my small business (same reason, threat of no deal Brexit, I sell EU-wide), because everyone was saying *end of the UK!*.

But in the end, nothing's changed... *sigh*

And now I don't expect much to change after 2020, they'll either reach an agreement or drag it on for years, because no one is insane enough to just cut ties with the UK or EU, depending on what side they're on.

The UK is very active, being so densely populated, there's always something going on (like meetups, pubs, companies, concerts, etc) easily accessible by bus or train. People are really lively, and Brits in particular are very polite even if they don't like you. It's about the same in most cities/conurbations, to be fair. 

I grew up in a small town too, I do like having a nice house with a big yard, but cities are great in their own way.

English cities specifically, have a lot going on, a lot of great food from all over the world (much more so than even Germany or Netherlands), which I love.

The risk of violent crime is higher than some sleepy town, but still extremely low. You're more likely to be scammed by landlords and flatmates out of your money, sadly, so you gotta stay smart.

Sharing a house is very common, even if you've got the money you're unlikely to get a flat or house to yourself as you've got no credit history. So 3-5 people in a house is normal. Bedrooms are tiny compared to even Belgium and the Netherlands.

UK countryside ranges from rich snobs in their mansions to retired people who may be racist to people on benefits that hate everyone (and everyone hates them) and jobless youth waiting to move to any city lol. Either way, you're not getting a good Internet connection or public transport."

Since the Brexit ref, people pay more attention to it, so expect stupid questions and remarks and hope for no actual hate or violence. Most are just curious, but many hold that tiny ""ugh, foreigner"" thought in their mind. 

The media is extremely fucked up and has riled people against everyone, the Irish are bastards, the Germans don't give us what we want, the Europeans are dirty job thieves, the Spanish want Gibraltar, etc. And they fucking call it ""news"".

Finding work and getting along with coworkers is harder than before. If you're a student, it's not as much of an issue.

But yeah, overall it's fine. Stay away from bad areas lol"

So fucking happy the Bukkake Party are leaving the EU, never seen a more spiteful group of liars.

Express and Metro are lying with impunity, all of their ""news"" are awless level spins designed to rile people up against some chosen ""villain of the month"". They are not news and should not be allowed to portray themselves as news outlets.

Here's an idea: if they peddle bullshit as news, slap them with a massive fine so they can actually contribute to the treasury, or go out of their shady fucking ""business""."

Could you provide some examples? Or examples of British culture? Because honestly I'm not seeing much of a difference between Brits, Germans, Polish, Slovakians, or Romanians. Only obvious exceptions: Brits are outwardly more polite, and Romanians have no problem living 4 to a room if it saves money (but maybe it's because it saves so much?). Other than that, everyone loves pizza, drinking, partying, holidays, talking shit about other countries, there's no religious nuttery, everyone seems mostly the same to me"
