Regarding being a giant, the consensus is the following regarding weight:
 ""Giant: Males reach 80-110 grams and females 60-90 grams by one year of age as typically seen in the heterozygous state.""

Yours looks a touch smaller than that. I might actually increase the feedings a bit as she looks a little on the skinny side. Most captive Leo's are overweight because people like the look of a fat tail, but yours could possibly benefit from some extra treats like waxworms to get some weight added on. 

Thanks for sharing, beautiful gecko."
