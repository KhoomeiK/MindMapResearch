punk,ff9th4r,t3_esemmo,1579720907.0,"As I become more and more aware of music history, and especially black music history, I become more and more confused about these these retroactive superlatives or titles. There have always been black people making rock music. *Black people invented rock music.* We could go way back and call Bo Diddley ""the black granddaddy of punk rock,"" but that would be obvious cherry picking. It would ignore Diddley's influences, contemporaries, and other acts that followed him as a musical tradition iterated an mutated into what we (arbitrarily) call punk rock. 

It's good to end the erasure of black artists by the mainstream music industry, but talking about 'the first black punk band' or even the first punk band in general is clickbait. Hell, I've seen the Standells (Dirty Water) called the first punk band in an attempt to sell best-of albums.

Anyway, I made the comment about white fragility because this project is obviously about broadening black peoples horizons, and getting in touch with their roots through art. However, if you take a glance at some comments on the thread, you can see that others have read into that as an attack on white people"
banjo,ff85pap,t1_ff84hby,1579666709.0,"It's definitely a niche sort of project, but I don't think that discredits it in any way. 

Out here in Boston, I can think of plenty of black people, mostly college aged, who are interested in reconnecting in this sort of way. One possible roadblock is the apparent whiteness of the banjo in mainstream American culture. Few black people are going to associate it with proud Africans maintaining their culture after being forced across the Middle Passage, transmitting their culture across oceans and generations through an African aesthetic and artform. They're gonna associate the banjo with Stringbean and Mountain Dew. Obviously, unless they're trying to go hillbilly, it wouldn't even Dawn on most as an avenue for self-discovery. 

So the point would be to open this avenue to people who are interested, because someone in the demographic wants to share something important to them. I don't see any reason to shoot them down other than some of their language making white people feel insecure

Tl;Dr I'm pretty sure it's just college kids being sophomoric, but I don't see any harm in it. If anything, it's good. Live and let live"

Sad seeing so many people becoming defensive about black people using political language about an instrument that only got imported to America through slavery. I think they have every right reclaim the banjo as a black or multicultural instrument (the same way rap is seen as black music) even if the language seems a little loaded or heavy handed.

You most certainly use the term, and I don't associate heavy eyebrows with bitchiness. That's on you, not a rule that unquestionably programmed into our genetic makeup. You interpret peoples' appearances differently than they mean to communicate based on different backgrounds. You percieve them, incorrectly, as creepy or ""bitchy"" (which is arguably the female equivalent of creepy) based on your unease surrounding different sets of social norms (highlighted by your confusion about why they choose to present a certain way.)

> In philosophy, ""the Absurd"" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life, and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe.[1] The universe and the human mind do not each separately cause the Absurd, but rather, the Absurd arises by the contradictory nature of the two existing simultaneously.

...

> Camus states in The Myth of Sisyphus: ""Thus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death, and I refuse suicide.""[21] ""Revolt"" here refers to the refusal of suicide and search for meaning despite the revelation of the Absurd; ""Freedom"" refers to the lack of imprisonment by religious devotion or others' moral codes; ""Passion"" refers to the most wholehearted experiencing of life, since hope has been rejected, and so he concludes that every moment must be lived fully
