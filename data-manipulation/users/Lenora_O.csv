NoStupidQuestions,ffx6wvp,t1_ffw9flk,1580319018.0,Interesting that Game of Thrones came to mind when talking about badly scripted entertainment featuring violence and bare chests.

thesims,ffp7ikk,t1_ffoi1hc,1580088177.0,"You could even build your own dungeons, treasure caves, and booby traps! I could not get over all the stuff there was to do, and how complete/unique each world felt. The people who lived there had fun back stories to explore and there were so many mysteries to solve. That was my favorite expansion."
StardewValley,ffnbjce,t1_ffgo2hm,1580064001.0,"I completely understand what you mean. It was comforting to share with family and friends who had also lost a parent. And the sweetness of the game was a little balm on my unhappy heart (even though it brought on the water works). Special indeed, and just the right tone for a game when I needed the distraction. :)"

If she hadn't been found she would have watched helplessly as her puppies starved, and then she would have eventually died of dehydration beside their rotting bodies.

Iamactuallyverybadass,ff6fift,t1_ff6362i,1579626077.0,"Governments and businesses shouldn't be allowed to push and bully people beyond their breaking point though.

The fact that he was mentally compromised and suicidal just emphasizes the unfairness of it all. 

And they still got away with it."
Iamactuallyverybadass,ff62ljd,t1_ff5btfa,1579617552.0,"He freaked out when his back was to the wall and had been pushed beyond the limits of his ability to cope. He committed suicide. He might not be a hero but you don't get to vilify the man either, just because of your personal or emotional experiences. The government is corrupt. Corporations are bullies. These are facts that ruin normal peoples lives every day. This particular man handled it the only way he felt he could, and then he took his own life."
NoStupidQuestions,ff4ppdu,t1_ff3u5gs,1579569455.0,"We found a stray 2 years ago who loved to snuggle but would bolt the minute I moved. 

What I did was get him used to being held while I sat down and settled in with him. After he was okay with that, he was somehow okay with the reverse (getting up/being disturbed)...he barely opens his eyes.

So maybe you could try getting him used to being carried/settled with in a chair or something."
Terraria,ff21m0f,t3_er319l,1579491356.0,I love that game. Mindless entertainment on the plane.

Sims4,fez05fa,t3_eqw164,1579452627.0,"They are great!!  But (always a 'but' with me on this sub, I'm sorry) I wish they weren't the driving force of the game, and that they had built emotions into a more complex reaction system, so that it really felt like the emotions and stuff happening MATTERED, both to the sims and the world around them. 

Even if they stuck to the emotion system and gave it permanent consequences so that a sims experiences made them change and evolve.

I was happy to see the direction The Sims Team was going with their latest survey and I hope they have something coming down the pipeline! One thing they have been great about is free updates (even if much of it feels like patching bald spots in the gameplay, it's a real solid and helpful effort)"
datingoverthirty,feye9t7,t1_feybwjd,1579444291.0,"Yes. I think that most of the people I have met are wonderful people in their own unique way and that they deserve all the happiness. I am not physically attracted to them just because I think they are good people. And at the end of the day, the reason I am not attracted to them is because of ME, and MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES, not THEM. It has little to do with who they are as people, and a lot to do with me. When I was still dating, people would get upset at me because they didn't understand why I wouldn't just give them a chance--dude trust me, this wouldn't work. I know me, you do not. But I wish you the best."
