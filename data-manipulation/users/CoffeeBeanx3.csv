A club for the elderly lead by teens.

A club for the blind lead by sighted people.

A club for Jewish people lead by Christians, or Muslims.

LGBTQ+ clubs are a thing because we are still a social minority, and we bond over shared experiences growing up and living life.

I don't know what your gender identity or sexuality is, but regardless, you surely have a tiny bond with people sharing both. Girl code, bro code, all that stuff.

I tend to bond with other LGBTQ+ people faster, just because it gives us some common ground to start on. It's like being part of a team, and these clubs are a place where we can be ourselves and openly support each other, because no matter how progressive our social circles are, ALL of us had to take some shit about our sexuality and/or gender identity at some point.

Add the fact that we're still a marginalised group, and you can nearly equate it to a club for POC run by white people in a predominantly white country, making the discussion about how white people can help POC.

It's just not ok. 

Maybe their sexuality would also be less of an issue if they actually WERE leading the club well. But they aren't."

changemyview,ffbllwj,t3_esplm7,1579771345.0,"1. Parents wipe their children's genital area clean for a few years. It is not unreasonable to assume that a 3-year-old occasionally gets their butt and/or genital area wiped by a parent. These are erogenous zones. Super weird to touch them, right?

2. Small kids often drink out of their parent's cups, eat their food, and slobber all over stuff. Yet you are more worried about closed-mouth kisses than sharing drinks and swallowing backwash.

3. What is wrong with small kids kissing each other? When I was a kid I kissed just about everything. I kissed trees, flowers, friends, cats, dogs, my sister even once kissed a dead mole. According to you, we should have grown up to be objectophiles, zoophiles and necrophiles. I would definitely not recommend letting your kid kiss animal corpses, but kids put everything in their mouth anyway.

Kids are taught about boundaries by experience. Parents should teach their kids about the importance of consent. Only touch people who are ok with that, only be touched if you are ok with that. As far as I am aware, this is a widespread parenting tactic. And with toddlers, a lack of consent is often expressed by giving the offending party a good whack on the head and unleashing a scream to rival a banshee, so why are you so worried about kids having physical contact?

Just because two kids kiss each other, doesn't mean they will open up an underground fetish club in kindergarten. 

I am now 23 years old and still occasionally give my parents a kiss on the mouth. It may shock you to hear that this is not the most intimate contact I had with my parents. In fact, I came out of my mother's vagina on the 15th of September, 1996.

changemyview,ff3754c,t3_eregb2,1579535286.0,"So you are saying people shouldn't recommend therapy anymore?

Look, I know finding a therapist sucks. I called a clinic because I was suicidal and they told me they could accept me as an inpatient in a year. When I couldn't drive alone because I was scared I'd kill myself on a tree.

In Germany, psychotherapists usually have at least 9 months of wait time. That sucks. At least we don't have to pay for them ourselves.

The people saying this to you are recommending therapy because they are worried. They don't know how to help you, and want you to have someone who's equipped to do so.

If you are in bad mental health, getting help is more important than your job. I don't know about the USA, but most places will give you time off for doctor's appointments, including therapy. You can do overtime another day to make up the difference.

And people recommend therapy because not enough people are actively trying to get help. You are. But I personally know five people in my direct social circle who really, really need help and refuse to get it, because of mental health stigma. Talking about therapy reduces that. I keep telling those relatives to go to therapy because they NEED it. And they refuse to go or at least look for help. 

It takes time and effort to find the right therapist, and even if you're in therapy, it takes time and effort to get better. But that's how it is with mental illness. And that's with or without people recommending therapy."

There are several studies that bald guys are perceived as more masculine and attractive than their ... hair-having? Hairy? ... counterparts. 

No hair = no bad hair days. 

And actually, it's not bad at all to get a head start on this, because when about 90% of all the other guys lose their hair (and they will), they will freak out and be completely insecure, while you will have had more time to get to terms with it and can rock your bald head with confidence.

A little bonus: I am currently 23, and even when I was 16, I could point out all the people in my class who would go bald. A lot of people start balding in their 20s, or earlier. You're just done with the process faster.

If your family is anything like mine, you will also get a nice hand knit hat every now and then, just to show you that you're loved. And while knit socks are cool, it's way better to have a visible sign of your family's love right on your head.

So next time your mum starts with the essential oils, tell her thanks for the head massage and making you smell nice, but the hair won't come back and that at the moment, you just don't want to talk about balding.

NonBinary,fcz1yun,t1_fcyp8vc,1578092045.0,"In that case, I think it might be the best course of action to talk to a surgeon before starting HRT.

I'm pretty sure that they can do a ""breast removal"" when you had some development. That way it's possible to remove the tissue that actually reacts to oestrogen and not accidentally leave stuff that would give you a lumpy chest.

But I am by no means an expert on this. How is healthcare where you live? Because my best advice is to get ALL the medical advice you can get. Talk to several doctors. If you have friends in the medical field (especially gynecology and oncology nurses give good advice on this) you can ask them about which surgeons are good at breast removal, who has good stitching methods, all that. 

Get recommendations, get appointments and talk everything through about a thousand times.

They likely can explain everything way better than us randos on reddit can.

Also, when you get on HRT: Use sunscreen. All the sunscreen, always, for at least a year. Spikes in oestrogen can cause hyperpigmentation spots. Pregnant AFAB people get that pretty often, and just a while ago I saw a post from a trans woman who got them, too.

So sunscreen. All the sunscreen.

Good luck with your transition! <3

Maybe update us when you found a solution, I feel weirdly invested in this."
AmItheAsshole,fcw84u1,t1_fcvcj94,1578019330.0,"Me too!! Gods, I was freaking out. I am high risk for 6 different kinds of cancer and whenever something remotely unusual happens, I just freak out.

Only one person afflicted by cancer in my family is now in remission. I had to watch the rest of them die.

That really messed with my head.

I think OP underestimates how bad it can be to sit in the waiting room of an oncologist and see the people that might be you in a few months, years or just weeks, fearing that you will actually die. The sister had to do that, knowing she actually *has* cancer. I was just there for my relatives.

I am so freaking lucky that my body insists on forming cysts in my ovaries and breasts. With how regularly I have to be checked, it is highly unlikely that I develop cancer without noticing. 

But I was scared shitless when I found my first ""tumor""."

AmItheAsshole,fcu1rkr,t3_eixhl8,1577969694.0,"NTA, this is alarming af to me. My mum had similar eating habits (not junk food, but INSANE portions and eating so much she would spend more than an hour just eating), and guess what? The doctors found out that she had freaking colon cancer, without a genetic cause. 

""Sporadic colon cancer"". The tumor was 15cm long and about 3cm wide, and had been growing inside her for about a freaking DECADE.

Now your brother is not in an age group where colon cancer is likely (neither was my mum, though), but other forms of cancer need an insane amount of calories to grow as well, and brain tumors often make people a bit insane about their food intake (shout out to my uncle).

I know I'm from a cancer family and about 3000% more paranoid about this stuff than the average human, but holy shit your brother needs a doctor. 

Show him this reply, please, and if he wants to hear more stories about this, I have several more. 

Health is one of the areas in life where you should definitely go by ""better safe than sorry""."
NonBinary,fcqd5jb,t3_eiatlk,1577883650.0,"I don't think so. Removing ""inactive"" (I mean not yet developed) tissue is usually only done in case of cancer. It will not look like a normal flat chest, it will look hollowed out instead. And since the tissue can't be removed completely in most cases, the rest of it will still react to hormones and grow.

If you mean ""can I get top surgery so I can go on hormones without developing breasts"" then sure - but you will have a lumpy and weird looking chest that is not considered aesthetically pleasing by most of society.

I highly doubt that there are doctors willing to do that.

Maybe there are options tailored more specifically to your transition. Why exactly do you want the top surgery? Why do you need it? Do you need HRT or are there other options to achieve your transition goals?"
nosleep,fcq80gj,t3_ei98fo,1577880686.0,"Wait. I don't get it.

As far as I gathered, the demon found OP without breaking any rules. Right? So OP says ""That's not fair"" because he's angry at being found?

Because I'm kind of split between this, and the demon being some kind of puppeteer that could see the entire mall, and the ""demon"" OP saw before just being it's puppet. Meaning the demon knew where OP was all along and just taunted him by making him encounter the puppet a few times. Somehow that version makes sense to me because of the stitched hands and OP's insistence that the game is not fair.

But it's the first one, right? OP is just doing this little kid thing where he freaks out because he lost."
