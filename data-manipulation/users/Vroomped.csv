As a teacher I recreated week one instructions for introducing yourself to class on our school's forums, ever semester. I knew with 100% certainty the instructions were up to date, included step by step descriptions and images. Is the first indicator of who couldn't even be bothered, and changes the way I use my class time.

In regard to actual homework that would be graded seriously. Know is your responsibility, that's why you receive the grade. You do not receive a grade so that you will learn / know. I don't know what you know unless you tell me; that's why I assign homework. So by definition the grade you receive for your homework IS your performance.

Schools that don't assign ""homework"" still expect you to study outside of class, and do issue guides for that study. They also grade more strictly in other areas."
