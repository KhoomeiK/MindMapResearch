You should probably watch out for that sneaky tequila as well, especially when distributed whenever you make a mistake playing volleyball in a pool. Speaking from experience here. I'm terrible at volleyball, lucky to escape that one with my life."

And yeah, the leg pain (and foot pain!!!!!) is real. I gave up on wearing them ever again about 6 years ago. Not worth it. I'll never forget going to visit my aunt one time (about 2 hours North from where I live) and my cousin from Atlanta was in town. Usually when I visit my aunt, we go hiking, maybe do yoga, maybe do some art, farmer's market, or just bum around the 99 cent store. Well, my cousin wanted to go *clubbing*. I brought nothing but running shoes, flip flops, sweatpants and pajamas with me on this particular trip because I hadn't anticipated a fancy evening out. Had to borrow clothes and shoes from my cousin because we're the same size, but she's a girly girl so that meant a too-short dress and giant spiked stilettos. I've never been so uncomfortable in all my life."

entitledparents,ffdeix0,t3_esxej1,1579819199.0,"1.) Call the police. Take photos of the padlock on the gate. If possible, take photos or videos of the mom talking about it. Hand that evidence over to the police. Even without the evidence, call them and let them know what's happening and who is doing it. Call them every single time she does this. 

2.) Invest in bolt cutters."

actuallesbians,ffddutv,t3_esdp7n,1579818803.0,"First of all, thank you for being such a great dad to your daughter! We should all be so lucky! Honestly, it sounds like you're doing it right. That's such a confusing age in general, and adding in questions about one's sexuality makes it even harder. The best thing you can do is to continue being loving, supportive, and accepting of her. It's a huge deal that she feels she can come to you and talk about these things at that age. And it may change, it may not...especially if she's questioning. Perhaps she's bisexual? Either way, you're doing it right, keep it up!"
