EliteDangerous,ffovqxs,t3_eu7807,1580082429.0,"> **Emergency drop:** Pressing the supercruise button twice in quick succession will cause you to drop out of supercruise even if you are over the maximum safe drop speed. Your hull and modules will take a minimal amount of damage. When you drop, other players that were in your supercruise instance will see your wake and be able to travel to it and drop there as well, but it will take them some time to do so. They will appear near your original drop location. During the time it takes them to get to your wake and drop, you can usually move far enough away that they cannot see you on their radar. 

Are you sure about this??  I thought that when you drop in to a low wake, you are placed in vicinity of the ship itself, not the original point where the ship dropped."

It was modified to serve as a rescue ship for when someone needs repairs or fuel.  It's still more than capable of serving as an explorer.   

There's one mining laser just in case I need to get some materials for synthesis from a ring, and two lightweight pulses just in the off chance that I might want to shoot something that doesn't shoot back.

It would be inadvisable to try to land on a high G planet with this ship though... the thrusters are garbage.  

It is also inadvisable to carry any kind of cargo beside limpet.  I once made the fatal mistake of chucking in cargo racks and doing rares runs (back in the day) since it had a sweet jump range.

EliteDangerous,ff5o8sx,t3_ersbag,1579602920.0,"I don't quite get what your build is for... if you are going long range exploring, it seems rather odd to have weapons, especially ones that run out of ammo.  

Bear in mind, that most exploration ships have zero weapons and no intention to fight (light armour etc) since you almost never encounter another commander way out in the black... and no NPCs either, so it is a waste to carry all the combat gear around while you are exploring.  Without combat gear, you can run much lighter and have a much larger jump range.  Most explorers want this.

Anyway, for an explorer build, combat capable, I would offer the following changes/advice:

&#x200B;

* Get another AFMU, so you can repair them.
* Yes, another fuel tank is good, but size 7?  No, that's overkill.  IMO, you should have a size 7 Fuel Scoop (saves you heaps of time scooping) and maybe a size 4 or 5 fuel tank.
* Military composites and HRPs are fine since you appear to want to remain combat capable.  It won't be a great combat ship, but the extra armour will help if those shields go down.
* Don't switch down your thrusters... if you want to remain combat capable, you will need them to turn your ship towards your enemies.  It will also help if you decide to land on a high G planet.
* I would advise getting a bigger SRV bay that can hold 2 SRVs, just in case you lose one.
* Get an experimental effect (mass manager) on your FSD.
* Not quite sure why you opted for a wake scanner.  Lose it imo... maybe a KWS would be better... or another booster.
* Engineer what you can to lightweight.
* Get your power demands lower.  This helps you run cooler, meaning you can scoop much more before overheating."
