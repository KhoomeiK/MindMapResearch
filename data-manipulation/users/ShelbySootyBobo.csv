So much LNG was sanctioned, built and brought online when oil was hitting plus $120. Follow that up with an overall contracting economy that’s already starting to run into climate change headwinds, and a slow but gradual pivot to renewables and efficiency in battery storage. Aramco saw the writing on the wall and cashed in while it was still worthwhile. Most of the big 4 majors are posting profit downgrades and the one I’m working for is actively pivoting to electrons rather than molecules.
