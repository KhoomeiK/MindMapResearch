Look at the pulse and engagement of the engine when considering if the community will be able to support you. Read through issues on github and see how problems are solved.

https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulse/monthly

3. C# is becoming a primary language along with Gdscript, VisualScript, and C++. Microsoft gave Godot a grant to hire a developer to create support for it over a year ago.

godot,ff8hnui,t3_erh7rd,1579678931.0,"Everything you see on screen is drawn with a shader. A pixel shader, aka a fragment shader, tells the graphics card what color each pixel is. In 2D or 3D, doesn't matter. 

Shaders are generally applied per material. So you could use them to achieve an art style by using the same concepts in every material. You could also apply it to your whole screen as an effect. But you may have to do some wizardry to achieve what you want, in 2D or 3D.

Shaders are an advanced topic, and the shaders in Shadertoy are extremely advanced. Basically if you see anything in Shadertoy that looks 3d, then skip it. It's using raymarching and adapting that for your use is months beyond a beginner.

Here's a 2D shader I wrote that allows you to play with fractals in real time. Watch the video, links to the binary project and source code are in the description. 

https://youtu.be/zfA0jLDRCZ4

In this video I show three scenes. 1) landscape made with a shader that triplanar maps grass and rock textures depending on the normal direction of the surface. Cloudy sky is a raymarched shader from Shadertoy. 2) Sandstone is a 3D shader, separate cloudy sky shader. 3) Space rock is a 3D shader. Space background is a raymarched shader from Shadertoy.

Gdscript allows for rapid prototyping, C++ and C# for slow modules. C# is becoming a primary language for Godot. By the time you are ready to release it should be pretty solid.

However you can easily, and should, download it and try it out with some networking tests in gdscript and using your library. That will give you the best reassurance. I haven't gotten into Godot's networking yet, but I do a lot of 3D and voxels and it's reasonably performant."

Like with tcpdump/Wireshark, if you want to do network programming you need to become intimately familiar with firewalls and IP. You can start by disabling your firewall during development. But you should normally keep it on. Instead it's just better to become familiar with how to configure it so you know it never blocks any of the protocols, ports, or packets you are using. Dumping your network is the way to determine what packets are actually being put on the wire, which are being received, what the packets actually look like, etc."

gamedesign,fe9g85w,t3_eo6cbe,1578937232.0,"Many game designers I know spent their free time designing game mechanics. Many game developers grew up programming. Artists were drawing. Musicians were playing music.

Playing games does not lead directly to any role in game development. It might lead to being a competitive esports player if you are very, very good and dedicate all your time to it.

You can transition from being a content consumer to a content creator. But you'll have to stop playing games to consume them, and start playing them to study them. You'll have to pick a discipline (programming, designing mechanics, art, music, sound design, marketing, pr, financing, producing, management) and start working on building out your skills and experience. You can explore these areas and see what you like doing. 

If you want to be an architect, look at a degree in game design, but really you should get some game design books and start designing game mechanics and see if you want to spend four years doing it. In fact I wouldn't go to college for game design. I might for programming, but if I were to do it over again today, I'd avoid college. I have a CS degree.

gamedesign,fdj3l3x,t3_ellvzh,1578457526.0,"> I am not able to find time to learn programming.

I picked up a book on C++ and learned to program myself at 17. I was programming BASIC and LOGO in the computer lab with my friends years before. And on a commodore 64 at home before that. 

I had a book on 3D programming in C++ but I never found the time to work through it and make my own 3D engine. I wish I had.

You can find time to learn programing, you just don't want to. If you really wanted to, you would make it a priority. Instead of playing games you'd be making them. Instead of playing on your phone or talking with friends on lunch breaks you'd be going to the lab to work on your projects. As you learned you'd be talking with your teachers about replacing school projects with computer programs you'll write. Teachers love that kind of initiative.

The attitudes, interests, and work habits you develop now and over the next 4 years will dramatically shape what your college and adult life look like. Most of your peers will waste their time. You have an opportunity to set yourself up to pull ahead.

To answer the rest of your question, pretty much nil. Everyone already has game ideas they went through the hard work of learning to program, write, or make art to see come to fruition. 

The best way for you to become adept at designing games is to pick up a game engine and learn it well enough that you can prototype games. Then make tons of them. Once you have a great prototype, then you have a chance at bringing in other people to help you build it up.

Also I'd recommend Godot over Unity. The engine and the scripting language are easier to learn. 

Good luck."

gamedev,fcv6kty,t1_fcv3k04,1577995700.0,"The most important thing to do is finish it and as the producer that is your only job. I would get serious about limiting your project scope and defining a realistic schedule.

I would write off your team. I would plan out how long it will take you individually to make the prototype. Then I'd let your team know, ""hey, I'm going to make this prototype so we can play it, see if it's fun and decide if we want to continue with the project."" Then I'd make the game with free online art assets and sounds, and you as the only programmer. If they join, fine but it's unlikely now. 

You don't need their art or sound for a prototype, at all. Asking for art and sound before you have a prototype is a waste of their time, I'm sure they felt that. 

Next evaluate if your game is actually fun and worth spending more of your time on. If so, then I'd have a heart to heart talk on the phone/video with each person individually, and I'd say, ""hey we have a prototype, I think it's great and I'm committed to making this. Here's my estimated schedule, and my planned scope. Are you still interested? If not, that's OK I'll find someone else. And you can jump in later if you wish, I just need to know so I can plan. Why don't you try out the prototype over the next few days and let me know.""

Then after three days start recruiting new people. now that you actually have a prototype, you have something tangible for people to jump on board with. /r/INAT and other places. Be continually recruiting to fill out what you most need. Learn from your mistakes and realize that you broke your team due to mismanagement of them, the schedule, and/or deciding to work with friends who were never going to work out anyway. Again as the producer, the only thing that matters is finishing. The success or failure falls entirely on your shoulders.

Finally, the flipside of listening to their creative input is not too much. You still need to have a vision that team members can subscribe to and enhance, and not be totally open ended.  Your idea is an archeologist teacher / adventurer who fights Nazis and chases the ark and the holy grail. If your team member says ""what about aliens?"", you gotta say ""interesting idea, but no""."
gamedev,fcv2rwm,t3_ej1jjb,1577993454.0,"What have you been doing for 7 months without a prototype?!

First you should be prepared and committed to finishing the project on your own, without any of them.

Next you need to be cognizant of and eliminate any demotivational behavior. For instance having your priorities so out of whack that you have their attention/time for 7 months yet haven't even made a prototype yet. Wasting their time will kill your team. Not verbally appreciating everything they do will demotivate them. Demanding they do anything, or suggesting too strongly, when you're not paying them, will do so as well. 

Working with friends is generally a bad idea. They rarely have the same interest in working as hard as professionals you hire, or professionals looking for credit. Your friendship allows them to slack off. Confronting them or even firing them from the team may be necessary, but if it's your friend, it could lead to a falling out.

What is motivational is a good, friendly, mature, committed leader who is organized, continually moves the team toward progress on a solid plan with a tightly controlled scope with the finish line always visible, an excellent communicator, one who freely gives out sincere praise to those who earned it, one who blames team failures on himself, one who solves or finds solutions to his people's problems, personal, professional, technical, or creative, one who listens to and acts on his teams suggestions and encourages their ownership, creative input, and autonomy.
