Charadefensesquad,ffaownr,t1_ff8gw36,1579741050.0,"You can have your own opinion - and while I agree and also see Chara as female - I just don’t think something like that was intentional.
Chara’s name is commonly interpreted to be taken from “Character” so if what you said is true, (in that Chara’s name has another meaning) it was most likely  unintended.
No hate tho, you can think whatever you want, just don’t preach your interpretation as fact.

I ended up in this sub after watching Judgement Boy’s “Who is the True Villain Of Undertale?” Some people were referring to it in the comments, I made a reddit account and joined.

I’ve really enjoyed this sub so far. 

Everyone I’ve met has been very nice and civil. While I’m sure there are at least a few “toxic” members - but let’s face it, you don’t really have a proper fandom without them - I’m happy to report that I haven’t encountered any in my stay here!

I don’t really have much of a problem with the people who believe in Geno!Chara. As long as they don’t go around preaching it as a fact I’m fine.

I personally don’t believe in Geno!Chara or the idea that Chara is responsible for the Player/Frisk’s actions in the Geno Run. (However, I’m fairly confident that they do land the final hit on Sans, Asgore, and Flowey at the end of a Geno Run, since those are the only attacks that are out of the Player’s control).

I think this fact is most evident in the line “With your guidance...I realized the purpose of my reincarnation...” This quote clearly shows that Chara really didn’t want this in the beginning. 
That they were only learning from the Player/Frisk, acting the way they thought they should act.

I also believe that Chara was in fact slowly becoming corrupted during the events of the Geno Route. The fact that the stats screen displays their name, clear as day, pretty much shows that Chara - and in fact not Frisk - is the one actually gaining all of the EXP and LV the Player/Frisk attains by killing all of the Monsters. 

Going back to the whole “Chara was only doing what they thought you would want them to do” point, the EXP and LV would in fact make it easier for them to kill the monsters, since these attributes - as Sans explains - numbs a person to the pain of others. It would make them less hesitant and more open to killing everyone, and therefore explains why they kill both Asgore and Flowey (two people that were extremely important to them in life) with little-to-no hesitance or remorse.

Anyway, I think I’ve rambles on for too long! I hope these answers were enlightening or at least interesting!

Have a productive day/night and be sure to STAY DETERMINED!"
