depression,ffaos8l,t3_esj04r,1579740966.0,"I can tell you as a 4 time college failure, and a high school alternative tutor. That 1 D- won't mess you up. In my state, they just have you make it up on eduphoria on the elective they take away from you. I've had a student walk in and finish under 5 weeks. and then they don't have to class work anymore. It's like that D never happened. Unless you have 8/9 of your schedule with like 50's I would suggest you go to your counselor to work out a plan."

Anxiety,fewv627,t3_eqpep1,1579419984.0,Give it 4-6 weeks to start working. It's not like alcohol that gets into your gut and goes to your brain within the hour. If it's one thing I know from seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist is that they need to know how you are doing so you two can plan your next move.

Anxiety,fews0a6,t3_eqt3pb,1579418616.0,"Tolerance happens with Klonopin use which then you tell your physician that you're tolerant with it. But there is a heartache associate with anxiety that feels like a heart attack but isn't a heart attack because you're not in Heart Attack range. If it bothers you, talk to your doctor about it, and maybe they could start you on something."
Anxiety,fewrij8,t3_eqianl,1579418416.0,"So quick story, I failed an accounting class for my degree (which is accounting lol) and it practically gave me PTSD during my accounting test, because we had chapters due every class. Too easy ( I think) but only 4 tests ( 1 half term, 1 midterm, 1 3/4 term, and 1 final) and if you managed to fuck those up, your fucked because the chapters were only a small portion that it wouldn't matter if you got 300/300 out of 1000 points. So after failing the class 2 times, I talked to my school, and i got Section 504 accommodations to be able to test in peace. Try talking to your school about test anxiety so they can help you."
Anxiety,fewqp9u,t3_eqrb15,1579418065.0,"SSRI's like Paroxetine or Escitalopram or Zoloft have some similar side effects like sexaul dysfunction, sleep issues, suicidal tendencies especially this one I experienced in full force as I was only 21 at the time and it was off and on for 2 more years  . So I talked to my  Psychiatrist and we switched me to Wellbutrin (most people know it as the smoking secession aid) for my anxiety, and I have felt very little side effects and what did present was more manageable for me."
depression_help,fewpkyt,t3_eqophs,1579417585.0,"Generally you need to be only on Wellbutrin to work. It's hard because your on an SSRI. Sexual dysfunction is not atypical. When I was on SSRIs, I would have to find the boy equivalent of a Gspot with a vibrator and that was the only way, otherwise it would be impossible or take like 3 hours. But Viagra is what most psychiatrists do when solving SSRI induced sexual dysfunction."
Anxiety,fewovj6,t3_eqrfep,1579417252.0,"I've had those feelings of ""sensing a disturbance in The Force"" that almost mimic those of a heart attack, but I am 23 so I can't get heart attacks. I am on anxiolytics, but I take my mirtazapine and it helps me sleep better. I'd say if you can confront the source of the anxiety, I would say do it, but if that's not an option. I would talk to a friend about it."
Anxiety,fewo3et,t3_eqj5ak,1579416645.0,It feels like it's a disturbance in The Force don't it.
Anxiety,fewo0p8,t3_eqqv80,1579416505.0,"I generally do get anxious going to somewhere like Downtown. Like Going to Downtown LA to me is like doing brain surgery. I find a spot where I feel okay to park and I take routes I feel safe with. Like in your case, do what feels okay. If you don't feel okay, turn back and try something that feels okay."
Anxiety,fewniwb,t3_eqrl6a,1579415813.0,"I would get the multivitamin that has Mg at 400mg. I know vitamins can be costly, so I would integrate it into my regular vitamin supplement. Also take heed because taking more will make you poo. Assuming if you take it 4 times as laxatives have 2000 mg of Mg. So just be careful in that respect."

Yes cry yourself to sleep, I have cried myself to sleep many a times) go drive to a happy place, (I drive myself to a happy place) or go release your anger in a healthy way. You are going to be okay!!!"
depression,feifbyu,t3_ep9c2l,1579137202.0,"Your experience isn't atypical. There are many of us (including me) that can't seen to be at par with my friends. When I was in High School. I would be soo scared of talking to people that I would go behind the library to cry and hide. And even in university, I joined a ""social"" fraternity \*Social is a euphemism for drinking club. And I never went to a party. I only went with people that I unintentionally have been vetting for over 5 years at that time, meaning I felt safe with them. So I proceeded to engage with my friend. I think you should find friends you feel safe with to be you.  As a German speaker myself, Ich weiﬂ du kannst es schaffen!! because nobody has been there to tell me that so I am here to tell you that!"
Anxiety,feie3g5,t3_ep3r5g,1579136365.0,"I can tell you as a college grad that has taken medication for anxiety/depression/insomnia that when I switched majors from IB to accounting, I failed my first class, it was Financial Accounting, and I would get anxiety from just being in class. So I reached out for help at my university because we have a crisis centre. And I ended up taking Financial Accounting 3 times, until I faced my fear, and passed the class with a C. To me it was like jumping from 2 building, and everything in between was me taking my final exam that would determine my fate. And a year later I graduated. You can do this! If you need help, ask for it."
depression_help,feicc3u,t3_epad68,1579135185.0,"I, as a fellow recent grad from December, I will admit it's taking a toll on me as well. I have applied to over 400 jobs in the span of 3 months. It does suck. I have stayed in my room just finding work. The trick is to tell yourself you will get out of this situation. Remember all you need is 1 yes. I feel like I am burden to my parents just sitting here looking for work. But the end result will feel amazing when you get your first job!"
