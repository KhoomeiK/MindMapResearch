The decline in skilled labor came fast and hard. I didn't want to do the hard work required to do the skilled work when I was young, because it wasn't sexy.

I wash before touching my penis. It is an important, sensitive body part that should be kept clean as much as possible.

Hot water, natural soap, if you don't piss like a child holding a firehose, chances are your hands come out clean. If you have been working like a dog, wash before and after.

Your thought process was on the money until you forgot about soap."

bjj,fdpsini,t3_em8q99,1578638782.0,"What a load of crap.

My fondest memories of my early training, was the daily gut check for the first 10 weeks.

I was a black belt in SPMKF, and never wrestled, AND thought I could fight. I am tall, fast, strong and athletic, and I was wild. The true members of this sub know this means I got thrown to the biggest big dog every roll until I wasn't a spaz trying to hurt someone from lack of control and not understanding anything about grappling.

I learned that I could persevere from that time, and eventually became the big dog the new wildman got thrown to for settling him down a little. It was a rite of passage for me; family hated it, girlfriend was scared, and I was being dominated for 8-10 hrs a week by blue and purple belts.

Personal growth is something to talk about and be proud of. Just because you got on your blue belt, now you're too cool for school?

Yeah, show this thread to your Profesor and he'll show you exactly how cool you are.

I do wish to point out, that you did start all of this with aggression resulting from a misinformed opinion that I was someone else, because ""Jedi"".

I usually respond to something like that in a jerk fashion. You are obviously educated and smart enough to understand this.

Will you accept an apology? You started, I overreacted, yay humans?

Edit: nevermind. You started the name calling and hostility. I made a comment using a word that some troll has previously triggered you with, and you called me an asshole for having a vocabulary.

You are a good person, but you are far from qualified to give anyone proper life advice - you still think you are a victim, despite having learned how to set boundaries.

Accepting dogma is failing as a human being. Period.

The New Testament is a brilliant spin job done by the Roman, Saul of Tarsis. An ""apostle"", lol. Jesus, Legion, and the damnation of pigs is my favorite passage. The abundance of logical failure is rife in both books. You ought to re-read the New... it is boring, not nearly as romantic and adventurous as the Torah, but if you read it closely you can see right through the pages.

Buddhism isn't really a religion. The Buddha was a man, not a God.

Overall, from your response, I take you as a rational person with a good mind. I have degrees in Philosophy and Religion, and am mostly Atheist at this point thanks to the rigors of investigation. I admit agnosticism, as I truly ""know"" nothing.
