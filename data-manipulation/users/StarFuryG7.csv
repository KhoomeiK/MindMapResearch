As things stand I don't like the reports about how this first season of the show is Patrick taking on Trump and Brexit.

It'll just be more of the same. 

I used to think that Patrick Stewart was to the left out of political expediency. In other words, Hollywood is to the left, he worked in Hollywood, and it was what was expected of him in that profession. So it was for the sake of his career that he decided to just go along to get along, but no --I discovered over the weekend that he's been pretty much a lifelong socialist. I also came to the realization while watching the clip of him on *The View* that he's apparently very much an elitist.

babylon5,feuu1er,t1_feufuqa,1579389900.0,"No, you've got it all wrong. TNT only came into the picture for the show's fifth and final year. They actually wanted to produce a sixth season, but Joe refused because he wanted to stick to the five-year plan without looking like a sellout. 

Babylonian Productions produced the show, and WB was its distributor, with it airing as part of the PTEN consortium lineup for its first four seasons. PTEN was an early attempt at creating a fifth network. That was how the show was originally sold and marketed, as part of PTEN. It went to TNT for its last season because PTEN folded and closed up shop, and the reason you're wrong in your assessment is because WB had no problem letting TNT pick-up the show. 

Of all the show's that were part of the PTEN roster, *Babylon 5* was the only series to survive its going out of business, **and** three new TV movies were also commissioned when it moved to TNT, along with a spin-off series (since they couldn't get JMS to agree to a sixth season of B5). 

If WB was so opposed to the show as you believe, none of that would have happened --and it also proved that B5 had potential beyond just the original series. 

And let's not forget *Babylon 5: The Lost Tales*, that was produced as a direct-to-home video feature, and which had the misfortune of being released right when the DVD market was beginning to really dry up and die.

I'm telling you, JMS did something to really piss someone off over there at WB. Or perhaps he just nagged them too much to the point that he got an executive over there really pissed off, vowing not to do anything more with that property. 

We don't know what it was, but I suspect the movie rights are also a part of it somehow."

Either something is an art, or it isn't. And you don't treat *art* that way in my opinion.

However, raising the image resolution to Ultra HD that way strikes me as far more questionable. That is **four times** the resolution of standard HD, so I would have to believe they're raising the image quality from the actual digital files, or are recreating them.

It's also entirely possible that Paramount did make it a point to store those original files carefully for this very reason, having actually thought ahead years down the road from when they were first produced, and leaked the story that the files had been *lost* to forestall releasing that cut of the film in HD, which probably would have meant having to make all of those original cuts and edits in the Director's Cut **all over again**, and they didn't want to take the time, or spend the money, in order to go through that whole process again.

SciFiScroll,fdn0qwb,t1_fdmfoan,1578573696.0,"Well, there is The Expanse subreddit, but I think they're having a difficult time adapting the discussions to how the episodes are now viewable compared to the way they were for the last three seasons. I seldom drop in there anymore, and if I do, it's only to see if there's some piece of news about the show that I've somehow missed, but I don't participate there any longer."
beltalowda,fdn0hm6,t1_fdmmkfv,1578573445.0,No problem. I figured it was a given that some people here would like it.
SciFiScroll,fdmebkz,t1_fdmdm29,1578547112.0,"You've never discussed an episode of show online with people also interested in that same show? The mods in the subreddits here on Reddit routinely set up weekly discussion threads for the specific purpose of discussing the latest episode. YouTube hosts post reviews of the new episodes on their Channels, and there are also podcasts that would cover new episodes weekly. The Churn was just one of many, and I just posted their first episode discussion of Season 4 of 'The Expanse' here just the other day, but most everyone has moved so far beyond that point in the show that I suspect not many people are even interested in listening to a podcast focusing on the first episode of season 4 at this late stage.

And that also illustrates the point I have been making here."
SciFiScroll,fdmb4bq,t1_fdlv1ko,1578544419.0,"> Meanwhile CBS all access and Disney should be able to take advantage of those same freedoms, but they have a legacy of IP rights and goals, and a legacy in terms of management philosophy that seems to dictate their behavior in rather predictable ways. They also have a ""brand image"" which dictates that they can say some things but not others. Disney is making progress in expanding that, while true old school broadcasters like CBS are still largely stuck making bland and safe content.

Bland and safe content? Have you seen 'Star Trek: Discovery'? They've done things on that show that the producers of TNG and post-TNG Trek shows were adamantly against and refused to do in their shows.

I couldn't disagree with you more there actually. CBS chose the *safe* route to do it all as streaming service content rather than on one of their stations.

> So I guess the staggered model kind of just rubs me the wrong way. Maybe I'd be happier if you could just configure a setting in your streaming service of choice to expose you to new episodes in blocks of seasons or one episode at a time over a configurable interval.

It's very easy to not watch an episode until you feel like via streaming, or even via the old method of *Free On Demand*, if you so desire. But a show loses free publicity, exposure, and vocal audience engagement online, via Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, YouTube, you name it. And that's a lot of free advertisement to just dump by the wayside by dumping a whole season of a show online all at once."
SciFiScroll,fdlif5f,t1_fdjz6p3,1578524705.0,"You can call it outdated, but it doesn't change the fact that it's the model Disney+ and CBS All Access (which beat Disney to the punch actually) are using, and they must be using it for a very specific reason related to marketing potential. 

Also, I really do not understand why it is that binge-watchers deem it so necessary to have the show(s) exclusively on their terms. What I mean by that is if bingeing is really what you want, as someone else here pointed out, you can have your cake and eat it too by just waiting until the show has put out all of the episodes on a weekly basis and then *binge*. Amazon has this thing about doing ten-episode seasons for its shows (which I do not like frankly), which means that you and people like you would be waiting for no more than two and a half months for a season to run its course. And of course, if you want to do a partial binge anywhere in-between there, you also have that option. I really don't see why having three or four episodes at a clip available is such a heartache to you. 

And there's another point I wish to make in relation to discussing episodic entries of a series being *a big part of my social life*, which in the grand scheme of things really isn't accurate. And in point of fact, 'The Expanse' was something of a spin of a roulette wheel for me as to what time of the year its season would debut. It was not consistent,  and the second season was basically impossible for me to discuss online because it premiered right at the start of tax season, and ended right when tax season ended (I work in a CPA firm). That was a very bad season for me because I really had no time to discuss it at all. But even when I do have some time to devote to the show online to discuss episodes, it really isn't a whole lot. My days are long, and I simply don't have that kind of time usually. But it's nice to know the option is there, and that I can even check out a few active threads here or there even if I don't have a whole lot of time to jump in and make my own thoughts known about a given episode."
SciFiScroll,fdk3q2g,t1_fdjziqt,1578495315.0,"I'm claiming that weekly buzz and reviews of episodes give a show more attention than it would otherwise get if all season episodes were released at once. The fact that 'The Mandalorian' is part of an established franchise is kind of beside the point in that context. 'The Expanse' got that same kind of attention for the three seasons that were aired on the Syfy Channel. Now, it no longer does."
SciFiScroll,fdjws8o,t1_fdjvdub,1578490004.0,"'The Mandalorian'? Yes, the stories, except for its mini-arc of sorts, is rather episodic, but it's also probably responsible for the most positive press SW has gotten the last few years, thanks also to Jon Favreau.

But I was comparing streaming service to streaming service, series to series, and how they were both chosen to be marketed by the companies sponsoring them. In that context, the fact that 'The Mandalorian' is part of a mega franchise is sort of beside the point. We're talking about the kind of buzz a show gets from a weekly release rather than an entire season being dumped online all at once. That was also the point of this article by the way, so it's not something I'm grasping at straws to discuss. These are deliberate strategies by the companies releasing these shows."
SciFiScroll,fdju2pn,t1_fdja74a,1578487511.0,"Agreed, but I have to believe that within the next two to three years, they will begin putting up new shows for Disney+ also.

SciFiScroll,fdjttc6,t1_fdjcedb,1578487255.0,"Amazon shouldn't have cut the episode count, and I think the pacing was better when it was on Syfy. Of course, most of the action was limited to the surface of Ilus this season, with some things happening above the planet, so perhaps Season 5 will move better. Right now, S4 is all I have to judge by though, and while I can see this season being better for bingeing to some people, I prefer not to take in my shows that way, and it also hurts the marketing of the series as I've said. How many people weren't even aware that there was a series called 'The Mandalorian' for instance, until a few weeks into its run, or who only decided to give it a chance once they began seeing the good buzz that was popping up about it?"
SciFiScroll,fdj060x,t1_fdiz5sg,1578455102.0,"Do you hear anymore buzz about ""The Expanse""? It's new season dropped on Amazon near the middle of last month, and already, it's all but forgotten.

I am not a fan of seasons being dumped all at once on a streaming service, and that's why. With there being a weekly break between episodes, people get to spend time thinking, and talking, about what happened in the latest episode, and get to anticipate what may happen next, whereas if you're bingeing through a season like a glutton all at once, you blow through it fast, and boom! It's over with just like that.

I don't think this is good for a show like ""The Expanse."" I think it hurts and doesn't help it."

Yes, there is. And he was a Starship Captain. He didn't get there by being meek. He got there through drive and determination.

> Yes, Picard came off as arrogant quite a bit. Especially in the earlier seasons.

Okay, so then it's a matter of personal preference as to who you prefer.

I'm not against Picard or Stewart's portrayal of the character. For me, he comes in second place, and which one people grew up watching is of course a factor. The author grew up watching TNG evidently, and therefore prefers TNG. And like many in his age demographic, he probably had only limited exposure to the original cast. In fact, most of his exposure to them more than likely came from the movies and not the original series. I find it difficult to take people like that seriously because they more than likely never gave TOS a fair shot, or any kind of *shot*, in the first place."
SciFiScroll,fdhrq2x,t1_fdhr8uz,1578428882.0,"Arrogant? Cocky at times perhaps, but there's a difference. And if Kirk was *too aggressive* at times, he had Spock and McCoy to help put him in check. That was their specific purpose in the series. That, and their friendships. 

And Shatner was playing the character he was given to play by the way.

And I would argue that Picard too was arrogant at times, despite his more *subdued* approach. He thought he always had all the answers himself pretty much."
SciFiScroll,fdhqoj7,t1_fdhpyyp,1578428278.0,"Money had a lot to do with that. Shatner was raking in the big bucks from doing the theatrical Trek films, and he wouldn't have come cheap to one of the shows. Why do you think Nimoy only showed up for a two-parter in TNG? Money, and yes, getting him for ""Unification"" costed them.

As for the number of seasons comparison of TNG versus TOS, people that have been around long enough know full well that had everything to do with TNG being a syndicated show, and TOS being a network series during the 60s, which was a very different time in television compared to the 80s.

And it was the immense cultural popularity of TOS that propelled the development of another series. So you can thank Kirk and company for giving the Enterprise-D and Picard and company."
SciFiScroll,fd5ilw4,t1_fd50h0h,1578177973.0,"I agree that it wasn't as good as the prior seasons, but I did enjoy it and am glad they were able to come back, and with Season 5 on the way, hopefully they'll be able to go bigger and better being that they won't be restricted to being down on one planet anymore (even though Mars was also thrown in for a considerable chunk of the action). What I also noticed and have commented on though was that the season felt shorter, and I had said when Amazon first agreed to pick up the show that if they only produced ten episodes it would not be a good thing, and I feel that prediction was accurate. We lost a good two and a half episodes with the transition, and it's noticable, and what's also noticeable is that there was a pacing when the series was on Syfy that is also now absent, which doesn't thrill me either."
