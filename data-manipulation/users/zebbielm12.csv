climbing,fffbzul,t1_ffefjec,1579880621.0,"What are your goals? 

If you want to get better at climbing, climb as much as you can. If you're still a beginner, just getting mileage on the wall is the best thing you can do.

If you're looking to build visible muscle, weight training is the way to go. 

No matter what you choose, the most important thing is consistency. If you climb/run/weight train 3 times a week for a year, you're going to see progress. 

Also - soreness isn't a good indicator of a good workout, it's more an indicator of working muscles you haven't worked out in a while."
SubredditDrama,ffckpt1,t1_ffcjzxy,1579801525.0,I agree with you. Right now I’m just terrified of Republicans owning the courts for the next 50 years and never being able to pass meaningful legislation in my lifetime.
SubredditDrama,ffcjgao,t1_ffcirsx,1579800758.0,This is the kind of shit I’m talking about. Ideological purity gets you nowhere. We don’t live in some fantasy land where believing the most gets anything done. Obama united the party behind his legislative agenda. It wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t what most of us wanted. But he actually accomplished something. I’ll take 10 Obamas in a row gradually making the country better.

ToiletPaperUSA,fehyr0t,t1_fehsx3x,1579126576.0,"Other answers here don't really go into the caselaw surrounding that phrase.

The beginning of Article 1 section 8 states: ""The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises"".

The end of that article states: ""but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States"". 

Notice how 'taxes' was not included in the latter clause. So taxes do not have to be ""uniform throughout the United States"". 

The real open question here is from Article 1 Section 9, which states: ""No capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid,[unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken."" In other words, no ""direct tax"" can be collected form the states unless it's proportional to the state's population. 

So is income tax a ""direct tax"" that has to be proportional to population? Well, [Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollock_v._Farmers%27_Loan_%26_Trust_Co.) answered this question. The Supreme Court decided 5-4 that, basically, capital gains taxes were ""direct taxes"" and had to be apportioned by population. Note here that regular income tax - even progression regular income tax - was deemed constitutional even back then. 

So after Pollock, the US ratified the 16th amendment, which states: 
> The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.

This amendment supersedes anything in Article 1 and makes progressive tax on any income constitutional. The real question here is: does the 16th amendment apply to a wealth tax? That's an open question. I wouldn't want to put it in front of the current supreme court though."
educationalgifs,fe5zwfg,t1_fe5y9mv,1578878658.0,Edited for accuracy. Neutron stars are still around 1-2 solar masses.
educationalgifs,fe5xlpe,t1_fe5qx8h,1578877201.0,"That’s not how neutron stars work. 

The sun resists collapse because of pressure generated by fusion. Glossing over some details - when the sun’s core runs out of fuel, it will radiate its outer layers and leave behind a core remnant. For stars below 10 solar masses, this remnant will be below ~1.4 solar masses become a white dwarf. 

For stars above 10 solar masses (and below 29), this lack of fusion will result in a collapse that produces a supernova and leaves behind a neutron star remnant. 

Neutron stars can range from 1-2 solar masses. Much larger than that and they will overcome neutron degeneracy pressure and collapse further into a black hole."
