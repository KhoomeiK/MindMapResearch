While you're at it with the nonsensical BS you're shoveling, can you explain to me how McConnell will be ""fucked off"" at the end of the year?"
politics,fgqcbw0,t1_fgpv91c,1581021634.0,"I understand your reasoning that everyone has a constitutional right to refuse being investigated until the proper legal rules have been followed, like warrants. That is important to the well being and rights of our citizens.

I guess what I dont understand is why the president and his cabal can challenge these congressional subpoenas without boundaries. He pretty much has unlimited legal recourse and a huge team of lawyers who can consistently challenge congressional rulings and subpoenas all the time, and at the same time. Everyday citizens, like the ones in your example, usually dont have this privilege and have little to no legal recourse when a warrant is issued against them.

While I understand that the POTUS has all the same rights and protections as a normal citizen, you comparing them to the POTUS like you did is a little disingenuous. Mr. Trumps, and the Exec branch, actions and policy objectively affect more people than the actions of your average Joe. It's easy to point at your next door neighbor being arrested for smoking pot in his home and say ""Look, our legal system works great!"" because that situation is only really affecting a couple of people. 

With the president, I feel like this system gets bent out of shape due to the power the position holds. If he is dealing with corrupt figures and bad-faith actors, we as the American electorate need a legal system that allows for a thorough investigation into the facts. Right now, it seems the legal system is working for Trump, not the American people.

If Democrats went forward with gathering more witnesses to testify in the House, it would have been plugged up in court by Trumps team for YEARS! They would never have been able to accomplish anything they did, and none of this new evidence would be available to us for the upcoming election.

I guess I am just upset with the way our government works more than anything else. And this type of legal obstruction will only get worse from both sides in the coming years."
politics,fgps9jp,t1_fgpner5,1581011011.0,"Can you explain why Trumps legal team tied up House witnesses in court with endless legal battles? Democrats couldn't make the case they wanted because Trump and co abuse the system. Period. Is this what the founders had envisioned?? Our government system has clearly been a sham for years. How can you not see that?

Were Deomcrats supposed to just ignore all the signs being left behind by Trump and the GOP? Was everything that happened just ""Business as usual?"". No, they needed to pull the trigger on impeachment now to at least curtail the precedent that this kind of behavior by a President is ok?

If you really expect her to step up to the world stage and provide step by step solutions to global warming, you are going to be sorely dissapointed. This issue is complex, massive, and will pretty much effect every part of our society in the years to come, including the world's economy, healthcare, human rights, and quality of life. NO ONE, I repeat, NO ONE has a fool proof solution to this.

That being said, we do know for a fact that humans are causing it via C02 emissions, deforestation, over-fishing, fossil fuel mining, meat production, and the list goes on....

We generally understand the broad steps needed to be taken to solve it, it will just require a massive push from most of the international bodies on Earth. But that currently isn't happening at a rate we need it to.


Enter Greta. Its called an awareness campaign. Her goal is to give a voice to the helplessness millions of younger people feel all over the world. And her words aren't empty phrases?? Clearly facts and statistics aren't convincing the people who have the power to change the planet, so getting the public involved and educated is the next best thing. People need to understand the dire situation we are in as a species.
