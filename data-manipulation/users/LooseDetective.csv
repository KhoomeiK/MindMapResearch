fatlogic,ffhkz7f,t3_etk624,1579940160.0,"I don't get it. If I'm someone who's bad with money and my finances need to be under constant control and often take a toll on my mental health, would you say to me ""is living above the poverty line worth the cost?""? 

I have lived without rules for 20 years, I became obese because of it and yes, undoing and unlearning those rules is constant work but it'll eventually get better. Not giving a shit about your life will not make you better."
progresspics,ffhj7du,t1_ff46cb6,1579937694.0,"Sorry I didn't see your comment! I stayed between 1000 and 1400 for the most part and it was not really healthy. I upped my intake to 1500/1700 and weight loss has been slower but I feel fine. I just stayed in a calorie deficit, worked out lifting and cardio from at least 1 to 5 times a week. Thanks!"

xxfitness,ffgbkqn,t3_et8f8l,1579902631.0,"I'm losing interest in going to the gym. I started a new job and it's mentally and physically demanding + my usual 1 1/2 hours of lifting 3/4 times a week + university. I feel so burnt out, I happily go to the gym but when I get there I need to scale back my weights because I just can't lift it. I don't know how to adjust to the new schedule, I walk so much more now so that's something too. I feel like a failure because I was doing so good then Christmas came and weight loss wise I'm fine and it's going well, but I just feel completely powerless at the gym. I'm starting to see myself as lazy because I can't accept that I might need time to adjust to the new situation and it sucks. Why can't I be more forgiving and love myself more?"
fatlogic,fezt0mk,t1_fez4y7m,1579461272.0,"I found a website that lets you calculate how many calories you burn with your stats and I tried it with light or moderate weightlifting for an hour (this is usually what I do without counting resting times) and the result was unsurprisingly less than 200 kcal lol. I just think that we're relying too much on exercise in general, I've seen close friends killing themselves running/going to the gym and lose a lot of weight, then gain it all back when they didn't have as much time to exercise because they never took time to learn about CICO or diet"

fatlogic,fez1ypq,t1_feyy9g6,1579453117.0,"I'm not an expert by any means, and reading the replies I agree that I worded my comment poorly. Personally, I don't eat back calories burned, and I don't feel deprived. Of course if you're doing heavy exercise daily or almost daily and you feel tired/deprived and your fitness progress is being affected by that you should up your caloric intake. I just set my TDEE with light activity and it checks out with my estimates, I lift weights 3/4x week, and usually hit between 10k and 15k steps a day. Everybody is different, you should go with trial and error"
fatlogic,fez0pzf,t1_feyp167,1579452834.0,"I agree that it's not entirely unrealistic but many will sometimes hit 10k steps and use it as an excuse to stuff they're face because they ""earned it"". When they're told to stop eating back those calories if they're plateauing they lose weight again. Most people still don't burn that many calories by slowly walking around, especially short women"
fatlogic,feyjcrr,t1_feyhpzi,1579446248.0,"Time to stuff my face with m&ms then, I earned it!"
fatlogic,feyh0bo,t1_feyf2jb,1579445433.0,"I don't know your stats and it's totally possible, but not for everyone. Most of the people saying that were short women so yeah, you're not burning 500 calories with 10k steps. I'm not even sure if there's a totally accurate way of measuring the calories you burn"
fatlogic,feycxvk,t1_feyaghs,1579443920.0,"Yep, I don't eat back exercise calories because I know that while I'm really active daily and get 15k+ steps + an hour and a half of weightlifting 4x a week, it's not that significant because it's not like that every single week. I think it's enough to calculate my TDEE with the ""light activity"" setting, my estimates check out. But if you exercise a lot of course you should eat more, otherwise your fitness progress will suffer."
fatlogic,fey9eld,t3_eqvvrb,1579442475.0,"The activity level overestimates is something I see a lot in r/loseit. People are like ""10k steps burn 500 calories"" no they don't? Most people burn really just a few calories with exercise. I know of people that run 1x week like half an hour and then say ""well I exercise because I want to eat whatever I want"" yeah that's why you've been complaining for years about your ""stubborn"" belly fat."

fatlogic,feh8jlm,t3_ep2rum,1579111362.0,"To be honest? I thought that too. I was that person. Browsing fatlogic when I first began losing weight was terrible and I felt attacked because I was using body positivity as a way to protect myself from the truth, I was incredibly unhealthy. Now, after many months, I've lost the weight and I've also lost the excuses I used to make myself feel better. I can scroll through the sub and agree with most users, and relate to their stories. I can see why they would think this is a hateful sub, but really, truth hurts. (Are Lizzo jokes still allowed? Lol)"

xxfitness,fegc3nt,t3_ep0nu9,1579087112.0,"I was very little, maybe 10yo? I remember being really upset at a play date and one of the moms wanted to pick me up, I refused because I thought I was too heavy and they wouldn't be able to do it. My mom has always teased me about my weight and to this day, after losing almost 25kg, she still does it occasionally. When I was young, whenever I was upset with her I refused to eat because I thought that the only way to stop her comments was to become anorexic. Stopped after puking bile after ""fasting"" for a week. Tried calorie counting at 15yo but became obsessed, I wasn't counting right, couldn't lose anything. So I stopped, I ballooned up after high school due to college stress and now I'm slowly reaching my goal weight, still scary, but I know I've got some really good tools from this sub and I kinda put my mind on autopilot, I just log what I eat, keep track of my weight, take my measurements every month, like an robot lol. The only way for me to do this is to treat it like a project, a study, no emotions. Collect your data, change what you have to change and move on."

Still gotta be more consistent with the gym, I'm stuck because I want to go but I always do legs and never arms or abs, I just can't be bothered. I don't want to lose my arm progress but at the same time I hate training my upper body :/"

loseit,feg58fv,t3_eowi3i,1579077504.0,"I agree, a soon to be doctor (he's in university) told me that it's not just the calories, but eating carbs after like 6pm makes you fat. DUDE, we constantly eat rice, bread and vegetables for dinner, I've lost 23kg???? OF COURSE if I usually finish eating at 8pm and weigh myself at 8am every day, if I eat a serving of pasta at midnight I'm gonna have more water weight at 8am. Doesn't mean that I gained fat if I'm in a calorie deficit! I swear people are just so gullible, he said ""are you a nutritionist? No, then go read their research, it matters"" and I asked ""why does the timing of the meal matter?"" ""It does!!!! Go read"" no answer then. So incredibly frustrating."
