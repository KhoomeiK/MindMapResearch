(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_poverty)

War on Poverty (1964): The forty programmes established by the Act were collectively aimed at eliminating poverty by improving living conditions for residents of low-income neighborhoods and by helping the poor access economic opportunities long denied them.

In the decade following the 1964 introduction of the war on poverty, poverty rates in the U.S. dropped to their lowest level since comprehensive records began in 1958: from 17.3% in the year the Economic Opportunity Act was implemented to 11.1% in 1973...The fewer poor there are, the fewer the relief problems. Getting people out of poverty is the most cost-effective public investment.

On Paul Ryan's Report: ""For conservatives, this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand existing programs or to create new ones."" Several economists and social scientists whose work had been referenced in the report said that Ryan either misunderstood or misrepresented their research."

I don't really see it that way. As I've stated, the art in your example is in the programming of the tool, not in the output of the tool.

A hammer is an artful tool created through a thoughtful process. Houses built wiith hammers can exhibit artistically pleasing architecture. The act of striking nails as performed by machines, is not creative.

An aspect of being creative is about knowing when and how to break the rules to invoke a feeling in the viewer. Art is about empathy, which is about process.

This is a really interesting topic. My initial take is that machines don't have the requisite intention to create art that evokes feelings in the viewer. Art and criticism of art co-exist, informing each other in a co-evolutionary dance. Machines simply brute force patterns to mimic some endstate the programmer codes.

Don't get me wrong though, AI generates good music and visual art, but I separate technical fluency from creative process. From the article:

""how we perceive the world around us and interpret meaning in the content we consume...art produced by AI would be little more than an imitation""

Tolstoy: ""Art is a human activity, consisting in this, that one person consciously, by certain external signs, conveys to others feelings he has experienced, and other people are affected by these feelings and live them over in themselves""
