Music,ffukqxc,t1_ffugjyc,1580244022.0,">Adele is definitely one I missed.

There's a ton you missed. I don't think the list is as small as you're making it out to be. Taylor Swift could. Ed Sheeran could. U2 could. You don't have to like them, but they all release #1 albums. 

Basically, any active artist on [the list of Best Selling Music Artist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists) could impromptu drop and album and it'd be #1."
Music,ffubwju,t1_ffu7ep6,1580238727.0,"Gambino hasn't even released a #1 record (*Awaken, My Love!* peaked at #5 on the Billboard 200), nevermind doing it with an impromptu unannounced album. 

Rest I agree with though. Although, there are plenty more artists who could do it though. If Adele released an album called *30* tomorrow with no advertising, it would be #1 in an instant, for example."

PS4,ffi2xex,t1_ffhze3d,1579963527.0,"I bought a PS3, and then PS4, strictly as a media device. The PS3 could play Blu-Ray, stream Netflix, and stream local media from my media server. I had a PS3 for years, and I think the only game I played on it was *The Last of Us*. Now, I've had a PS4 for years, and same thing. Used just for media. I don't recall playing a single game on it. The FFVII Remake will be the first.

Now, with the decline of Blu-Rays and everything being digital, and rise of better streaming media devices, it'll probably get replaced with something like a Shield TV. My large Blu-Ray collection has been sitting in a box in my garage for years collecting dust."

I'll agree with the burden of lying on the person making the claim, but please don't hold your breath waiting for the source. Not because it doesn't exist, but because I'm not going to listen through a hundred hours of podcasts and interviews Jonathan has done over the years to find the piece I'm talking about just to prove a point.

Not really. It's an 80+ gold PSU. Meaning if it's pulling 360W from the wall, at 80% efficiency, ~290W is getting delivered to the system. Still have plenty of room."
