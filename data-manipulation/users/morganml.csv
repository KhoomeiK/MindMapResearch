Solar.  south facing panels with a 24v battery bank.

a genny that long with that uptime is gonna be ridiculous in overall cost. Eat it up front, spend the 3-5 k on panels and batteries.   

a 24 v system is better than a 12, mainly due to efficiency gains.  Try to build a battery bank that you will only deplete about 15% or so nightly, this will ensure longest possible life of SLA batteries, less of a consideration with others.  

Youre gonna look at solar, and learn a few things, and think ""this is just complicated enough i wanna go genny.""  

hauling fuel, constant refuelling, oil changes, filter and gasket breakdown, along with general mechanical failures will prove that wrong in the long run.   

Its not all that hard, and you'll save a fuckton of money just for learning and practicing how to be more self sufficent"

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fe4jh9a,t3_enarrl,1578859947.0,"ex fiances uncle spent 12 yrs in federal pen, indicted on 12 counts of conspiracy to smuggle one ton of marijuana from mexico to the US.

LE rolled a friend onto him for a small amount of weed his wife had, and they wired him up to go have a conversation with the uncle about how they would, if they had the opportunity (which they did not)  move that amount into the US.

On that conversation alone they convicted him.

to be clear the guy was moving major amounts of weed through the US, he just wasnt importing from mexico. never had, never wanted to.

LE knew all this, and just used conspiracy laws to indict with no actual evidence of crime."
