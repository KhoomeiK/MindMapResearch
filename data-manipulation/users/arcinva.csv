dysthymia,fejt506,t1_feit78c,1579185215.0,"Oh, I feel this so hard.  Until August, I'd spent the previous 2-3 years in steadily worsening condition.  I've always dealt with tight/sore muscles in my shoulders, neck, and shoulder blade area due to my anxiety and low energy from my Dysthymia but then I started getting stiff and sore all over and was so downright *SLEEPY* that my psychiatrist ended up giving Adderall to help so that my anxiety and depression wouldn't worsen even more over worries about my job, etc.  My GP ran tests for Lyme disease, autoimmune diseases, and finally checked my vitamin D level.  My vitamin D was low so I started on a supplement for that but it didn't help.  For about a year, I started taking CBD oil capsules from the health food store (so I mean hemp-derived CBD oil, not medical marijuana derived) which actually *did* help some with the stiffness and soreness.  But then I progressed on to having widespread nerve pain.  My psychiatrist and I also tried some different dosages and different antidepressants to no avail.  I also started taking gabapentin at night to help me sleep because sleep issues started (weirdly a good while AFTER the overwhelming sleepiness had started).  My GP also referred me to a sleep doctor but after a consult, we knew we could rule out sleep apnea so he didn't feel a sleep study was necessary.  It looked like we were on a path to a diagnosis of fibromyalgia when my psychiatrist decided to try Cymbalta because it is an antidepressant that also has an indication for fibromyalgia pain.  I also decided it was time for me to take some time off work, which my psychiatrist thought was an excellent idea.  So he gave me a note for a 6-week leave.  Between that time to decompress and the new medication, I improved like 85%.  Over the past few months, I've noticed that of I go more than a couple of nights with little or poor sleep or let myself get too stressed without remembering to stop and breathe and relax, those pains start coming back some.  So, yeah... Sorry for the really long-ass response.  LOL."

aww,fedrzo0,t1_fedqdw3,1579018631.0,"Depending on if you are doing a private adoption through an agency, private adoption through a lawyer, or through the government and whether it is domestic or foreign.  I think domestic, private adoption of a healthy infant can run up to $40,000.  Foreign adoption through a lawyer possibly as little as $8,000 (but here's where you have to worry about shady shit).

EDIT:  But costs associated with adoption cover things like the background checks and home visits to approve you, the lawyer(s) and court costs for the legal process of the adoption, and the overhead costs of the agency for finding/matching kids and parents, etc."
aww,fedr99u,t1_fednda5,1579018175.0,"Foster-to-adopt is the cheapest way to go.  Of course, there may be the emotional turmoil of waiting to see if parental rights are terminated, etc.  But I know 2 couples that have adopted kids around the 3-7 age range after having fostered for maybe a year or two and overall their experiences were positive and the children didn't have any major emotional issues and have integrated into the family nicely.  One couple already had one child a few years older than the 2 sisters they fostered.  The older child was adopted as an infant from another country.  The other couple had a baby right around the time their foster child became eligible for adoption and that child LOVES their new baby sibling."

Another Fun Fact:  3 of my 4 grandparents lived into their 90's.  All grew up poor, 2 remained poor their entire lives and 2 were at most middle class after their children left home.  Longevity isn't only dictated by wealth for constant, top-of-the-line medical care."

AskReddit,fds2533,t1_fdrnqpe,1578693190.0,"Looks like Amazon's generic is close to the same price.  BUT, if you then compare Costco salaries and employee satisfaction to Amazon, the clear winner is Costco.  I mostly stick to buying books, CDs (yes, I still buy those), and DVD/Blu-ray from Amazon or things that I can't find elsewhere.  Other than that, my love affair with Amazon ended when 1) they got too huge and 2) their site became a sea of cheap Chinese crap that you have to wade through to try to find quality products."

I know other people with houses built within the last maybe 10 years and they do not have those toilets.  It's so stupid.  The only excuse people have is that they are more expensive.
