They would order a glass of wine, then sit and chat, order an appetizer, chat some more, order another glass of wine, get their app, order their steaks, maybe a third glass of wine, chat some more, get their food... It was usually closer to two hours that most people were there. Yet I still had plenty of people telling me they’d be in and out in 30 minutes, but only if they got the reserved table, of course"

The rule was that I couldn’t sit people at a reserved table within an hour of the reservation. “Oh, why can’t we sit *there*?” “That table is reserved.” “But for when? We’ll be real quick!” “They should be here in about 30 mins.” “Oh, we don’t need that long! It’ll work. I already know what I want!” “Sorry, I can’t do that.” “But I *said* we’ll be real quick!”"
