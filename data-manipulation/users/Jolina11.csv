pharmacy,ff2s142,t1_ff0hkrx,1579521610.0,">""Just take it like the doctor said"" and walk away when I go to counsel and it is pretty disheartening

That's all well and good, but doctors are human too, and sometimes certain information is accidentally ommitted. If the pharmacist is there and is offering to counsel, why not listen and get a better understanding of what was presrcibed? It's not like it's going to take up much of their time anyway, so I can't understand why they don't accept pharmacist-counselling.

When I went to my dermatologist and he wrote me an Rx for adapalene/benzoyl peroxide, he mentioned the importance of moisturising, but didn't mention anything about using sunblock, which was especially pertinent since I was also taking lymecycline. He also didn't warn me to not wax my face, which in his defence, might be because he didn't want to assume my facial hair grooming. Thankfully, I knew such info because I'm studying pharmacy.

pharmacy,ff1m14y,t1_ff14abw,1579481399.0,"I agree, fighting fire with fire is definitely not the right way of going about it. The fact that they deleted their account also makes me wonder whether they received private messages which were even worse than some of the comments left on that post. 

I do feel guilty about it, because I didn't post this in the hope of recruiting others to ridicule her. It was a lapse of judgement on my part.

At the same time, (while I'm not justifying what I did) misinformation is harmful. So many people claimed that the pharmacist violated HIPAA, and if a complaint was indeed lodged, they could have cost this pharmacist her job or, even worse, her license.. All for doing her *job*!"
PCOS,ff1b9ft,t1_ff13u9x,1579477072.0,"In truth, where I'm from, patients complain about the waiting times whenever the service is public.  

But only in a pharmacy, do they walk in, cut in line and yell that they need to be served immediately because they parked their car haphazardly (usually in the middle of the road)."
pharmacy,ff0c8qc,t1_fezpjr1,1579467555.0,"I was obviously the first one to reply to the comment made by that person and I tried to keep it as civil as possible, even though they were really disrespectful. What's worse is that by the time I replied, their comment had 3 upvotes which means other people agree that pharmacists have no right to ""interfere"".

Clearly, a lot of people are uneducated about the role of the pharmacist as only yesterday there was a person making snide remarks about pharmacists (or as he calls them ""chemists"") on a television channel in the UK. 

In hindsight, I should have censored their name and not disclosed the subreddit, as they ended up deleting their account because of me."
pharmacy,fezy9v6,t1_fezjqle,1579463182.0,"Don't worry about it, I didn't find your comment offensive. 

Thank you for your advice. Luckily, I don't have it as bad as some ladies in that subreddit do. But for those who do, it's good to have a place where they can vent and discuss their personal experiences with a medical condition. As you said, the problem with such groups is that the advice given isn't always grounded in science/medicine. It's especially worrying if someone puts more trust in a random layperson on the internet than their own healthcare provider."
pharmacy,fezlojh,t1_feyvxeg,1579458706.0,"Yes, it's very unfortunate. There are a few bad apples in every bunch, whatever the profession.

I think that not questioning a prescriber is sometimes a result of being ridiculed when doing so. I know a clinical pharmacist who tried to persuade doctors to not coadminister 2 drugs several times. They'd give her a snarky smile and jot down both drugs in the medication plan anyway. It became a running joke amongst the firm, which was understandably humiliating for her.

And yes, such patients would want a pharmacist like that until they end up getting harmed in the process. Then they'll blame the pharmacist for not ""interfering""."

The importance of understanding that health issues might be embarrassing for patients, and therefore being respectful and discreet, was emphasised at the very beginning of my studies. 

I just wish more people would know that pharmacists don't ask these questions to pry into patients' personal lives. 

It was unfair of that person to not only generalise pharmacists, but to also belittle our profession."

PCOS,feydd4v,t1_fey44tq,1579444084.0,"You should really educate yourself on pharmacy as a profession and the role of the pharmacist in society and healthcare. It is absolutely the pharmacist's job to be aware of why your medication was prescribed. Sometimes, different therapeutic indications have different dosages and dosage regimens. Doctors don't always have time to counsel the patient on the medication they were prescribed, which is why pharmacists should advise patients (discreetly I agree with you there), whenever possible. 

Do you think we study for 5+ years just to fill a script and get a box of pills from behind the counter? It is such an unjust and honestly ignorant statement. Where medicines are concerned, pharmacists are more knowledgeable than doctors.

medicalschool,fe5sgmk,t1_fe5i5dw,1578873951.0,"A lecturer (who also works as a community pharmacist) told us that she had a post-MI patient who went to collect her medications. She educated the patient on the therapeutic indication of each drug and counselled her on the posology etc..

A couple of months later, a relative of the patient came by the pharmacy and told the lecturer/pharmacist that she's in hospital after suffering another MI, as she decided that some of the drugs (aspirin included) were redundant (in spite of the thorough counselling). In her mind, more medicines meant a higher risk of death.
