HeimerdingerMains,ffh6yed,t3_etlgbv,1579924839.0,Non-heimerdinger players are awesome too. We love you
aww,ff5ddq9,t1_ff3katm,1579588206.0,All I see are a bunch of strawmen. Go argue with yourself since you seem to be doing such a good job of it already.
aww,ff3ehg2,t1_ff3cbm0,1579539428.0,"You're still comparing dogs to humans. No one is going to spend the tens of thousands of dollars on chemo to cure their pets totally preventable testicular cancer. No one is taking their dogs in to be screened for testicular cancer on a regular basis because they were too irresponsible to have their pets neutered. It's exactly those types of people who would NOT do something like that to begin with. No, we don't castrate humans to prevent diseases because the human body relies much more heavily on testosterone production for growth and overall health."
aww,ff333fg,t1_ff3201u,1579532424.0,"Dogs are not like humans - neutering your dog is not the same as cutting your own balls off. Any vet will tell you to spay or neuter your pet and to do it at the right time to prevent the risk of dysplasia. Aside from keeping the already large population of strays at bay, you're reducing the risk of many different types of cancers.

Anyone else reading this, please don't be like this person and be so misinformed on this issue that you go around spewing harmful disinformation to others. A simple Google search will show you how wrong they are. Simply keeping your pet on a leash is not enough for a dog with the drive to breed. Pets do get loose every day entirely unintentionally and by the hands of responsible dog owners that do leash their pets."
aww,ff32093,t3_er7p83,1579531590.0,"Dogs get loose everyday. It happens, otherwise people wouldn't worry about microchipping their pets."
aww,ff30mns,t1_ff2zo4u,1579530485.0,"I didn't comment on his ""neuter status"". Hopefully that is what they are waiting on."
aww,ff30m2y,t1_ff2ugye,1579530472.0,Those other males should also be neutered. I'm not discriminating.
aww,ff30dyd,t1_ff2rt72,1579530285.0,Because there are enough dogs that have no home that are put to sleep every day.
aww,ff2nocf,t1_ff293ek,1579515145.0,Yes but please spay and neuter your pets.
AskReddit,ff2jw1q,t1_ff01ziu,1579509476.0,I had to replace a part of my popcorn ceiling recently because of some water damage. There is literally no way to match the rest of the popcorn unless I redo the whole ceiling. What are people doing nowadays??

leagueoflegends,feaaoig,t3_eo69uc,1578946353.0,"All I know is that 100% of the time it's the junglers fault we lose, unless I'm the jungler. Then it's my teams fault."

shacomains,fdbzlty,t1_fd9zwx5,1578264352.0,You described exactly how I play Shaco support.
leagueoflegends,fcyvcpv,t3_ejhv18,1578087887.0,There should be an /r/aww but for noob League players. This is like watching a baby kitten trying to walk for the first time.
videos,fcxbwy3,t3_ej9ax7,1578058668.0,I don't understand. You were home. Why not greet him at the door and ask him why he threw your package around like that?
leagueoflegends,fctlzzv,t1_fcthqxw,1577948333.0,"Did you read any of the comments on that post? It really seems like there is popular support for other game modes like Nexus Blitz regardless of the narrative. Nexus Blitz however will not pull as many people from outside League of Legends, which is why TFT is getting so much love and why it was promoted so much even before the numbers were in. It pulls people in that may not have wanted to play a MOBA."
leagueoflegends,fcsxk79,t1_fcskh2m,1577927637.0,I know I played it with my friends just about every day. Did Rito ever post the numbers? I find it really hard to believe it wasn't as popular as it felt it was the entire time it was live.

HeimerdingerMains,fcmm95b,t3_ehxuu5,1577781273.0,I build Lost Chapter for the sustain but skip Ludens and go right for the Rabadons. FInish Ludens afterwards if the situation allows for it.

shacomains,fchdslc,t3_egmfgo,1577649590.0,"Bush control is key. Use your boxes for ganks from the river like you said, but also start with sweeping lens to knock out wards in the bushes. Lay a few boxes there as well and the enemy laners will never step foot in a bush again. You should be able to get your spellthief wards ~10 mins by poking with shiv and boxes."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fc7bvss,t3_egfhw3,1577502936.0,I don't own the game but to just add my two cents - it's a major studio title that is on sale during the holiday season. If there wasn't an active playerbase a month ago there definitely is now.
