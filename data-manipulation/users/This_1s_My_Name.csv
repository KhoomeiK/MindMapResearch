That explains what it is in theory. If you hear an American conservative talking about traditional American values they're talking about America in the 60's. Straight white Christian families with a working father and a stay at home mom. It sounds like a Utopia at first, until you realize it strongly opposes individualism and just about anyone who wasn't a straight white Christian male had it pretty rough back then to put it lightly. Progressive movements such as women's rights, LGBT rights, the Civil Rights movement, etc. went directly against what American conservative traditional values/conservatism represents. You'll have a hard time finding anyone who doesn't fit into that vision supporting traditional American values, and for good reason. There are some examples of conservatives that are LGBT and such, but it directly goes against conservatism and you will find they inadvertantly support policies and people that harm them."
