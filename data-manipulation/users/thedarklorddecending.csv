jeffreestarcosmetics,ffyh3ot,t1_ffyh2ks,1580346279.0,THANK YOU! Why is reddit so easy and everything else so hard haha

dadswhodidnotwantpets,ffxepo2,t1_ffwwylu,1580323639.0,"I couldn’t agree more. Life got easier when we got our second cat because the first one had a buddy to exercise all his energy on. We always played with him like crazy but another cat just brought him so much joy.

Obviously some cats are meant to be solo cats, but MOST do better together as long as they are introduced properly.

Source: someone who has fostered several cats, currently has two cats of her own and give foster kittens."
jeffreestarcosmetics,ffuhgb3,t1_ffuhcrn,1580242030.0,"Yup that makes total sense! Thanks for explaining.

I’m in Canada so it’s way more appealing to order from them if possible but alas no dice."

mildlyinfuriating,feumo5m,t1_fes42m0,1579387942.0,This is my first winter of my life not living in alberta. I didn’t know you could feel joy and not just pure cold from September-April every year.
dadswhodidnotwantpets,fetwb1o,t1_fetg6ry,1579380663.0,"Tbh it sounds like you are allergic unfortunately. However, my partner is allergic to cats and badly wanted them. So we got them and he grew out of it. We gotten kittens to start and his allergies never really acted up. Not only is he not allergic to our cats, but he seems to have grown out of his allergy entirely to all cats."

jeffreestarcosmetics,fehc5b7,t3_ep410n,1579113526.0,"Omg I am saving this. I’ve never tried a z-palette before (if that’s what they are called) but I REALLY wanted this palette for the middle row. Maybe I should try. 

Did you say the middle row is colour pop?"

weddingdress,fegp5kz,t1_fe05ki4,1579099218.0,"I know I’m late but, you definitely do not look poofy. It’s obliviously a fuller dress but I don’t think he would look at you and think poof. I definitely don’t anyways."

weddingshaming,fea1mb1,t1_fe9l7sq,1578943403.0,"I don’t care what people wear generally, especially to an event they are hosting. 

However, it’s pretty rude to dress inappropriately when it is a specified dress code and you are a guest. No one is forcing you to attend, so if you plan to the least you could do is follow the only rule laid out."
BeautyGuruChatter,fe5w2m5,t1_fe5v7ev,1578876236.0,"I know I was really disappointed to find out. Tbh, I was told about it on this sub, so you might be able to find it with some digging. Otherwise, you can usually find her replies on the subject either on Twitter or insta. 

Before I knew, I didn’t think much when they said “we slept until 6 pm today” or “we’ve been hiding out in the editing cave” (when they have paid editors on staff) but now it all seems fishy. 

Granted, they were super busy with colabs and the wedding, so maybe it was just a bad year for them. I don’t think they are bad people, but they definitely seem really unprofessional to me."
BadMUAs,fe5mkh4,t1_fe4km7g,1578871433.0,"I think this is the toupee fallacy.

You think all fake tan looks bad but you only notice the bad fake tan. Plenty of people do it without looking orange or dirty.

I’m 200% with you on the smell though. TERRIBLE SMELL."
BeautyGuruChatter,fe5jjeb,t1_fe5g765,1578870228.0,"She always blames her staff every time production is slow. She’s had a few mass exodus where like half of her staff has walked out at once. Maybe she’s just incredibly unlucky professionally that way, but considering it’s always an issue I’m a little skeptical.

However, I LOVE her videos."
BeautyGuruChatter,fe32a0e,t1_fdzt4vf,1578845231.0,"Safiya has not done anything super controversial, but there is something about her victim attitude + how it impacts their production that I can’t handle anymore."
ANTM,fdtewt4,t1_fderg91,1578715773.0,Part of the reason they always look in same in every photo is because Tyras bf at the time was the photographer for every shoot that season.
ANTM,fdtdoc5,t1_fdhsavv,1578715271.0,I gotta disagree with you on that one. I really like her vibe now. She looks gorgeous and unique to me.

HumansAreMetal,fdhtmaa,t1_fdhl3ge,1578429934.0,"I mean homeless people are being forcibly evicted, sometimes illegally, from their living spaces. They are having their belongings taken and destroyed. I agree that most people aren’t doing that, but many people aren’t standing up for homeless/under-housed rights either. 

I think that might be where the comparison is coming from. MOST people didn’t participate in lynchings, for example, but stood by and let them happen or were ok with them. Definitely comparable in that way to the complacencies people have about the injustices done to persons living without homes."
