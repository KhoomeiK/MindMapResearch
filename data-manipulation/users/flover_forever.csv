You don't need dad, but it's nice that you want him to be involved. Unfortunately sometimes the people in our lives we most want arent the people we most need. Examine what you are sad about, and think about how you can remove some of the road blocks in your way. 

good luck sweetpea, life is long, and you got time to get this sorted out don't worry."

That's fair, and you're well allowed to be disappointed. I will say that I think you've maybe raised your father on too much of pedestal. Fathers should be supportive and kind, but truth is that fathers are just humans, flawed and imperfect. 

I won't tell you to forgive him or resume communications with him, that choice is always yours. I will say you may want accept who he is, flaws and all, and work with that real person moving forward in whatever level of involvement you want.

DadForAMinute,fekhz51,t3_epn83y,1579200433.0,"Hi Sweetpea, that's a lot for one person to go through, you've shown real grit in making it through it all. It's not your fault, and no, you didn't deserve to go though any of those things. 

Your dad was clearly flawed, imperfect like us all. He let you down and that's on him. I do think your anger towards him is both justified, and also harmful for you to carry around with everything else. I'm proud of your evolution, keep it up. 

Being jealous of the other kids, that's totally fine also, jealousy is fine, it can tell us what is really important to us, and we can use that to find the things that will make us happy in the future. A husband or boyfriend cannot replace a father figure, maybe you can find another male roll model at a community center or retirement home? There are lots and lots of good old men that are just rotting in retirement homes with nobody to visit them. It might help you. 

Keep fighting the good fight sweetpea, and remember you are not responsible for the actions of others, only your own, so let go of some of the anger towards a man that was clearly deeply flawed. 

Also tell your mom the same, she's not at fault, she can't carry his burden forever. She's just a human, not a saint, she deserves to pursue happiness too.

Just know, you are not responsible for the actions of others, it's not your fault that happened to you, and it's not your fault that your father is being so misguided in his priorities. I won't say 'stay strong or such things', instead, find people that you can be weak with. That should have been your father, but my guess is if he admits your abuser really did wrong he'll have to look himself in the face and admit that he let you down, failed as a protector, failed as a father.

DadForAMinute,feehigg,t3_emni4k,1579033862.0,"Sounds like you are starting to examine yourself more, and that's always good. Keep doing that, ask yourself the hard questions, figure out why you think or do the things you do. Don't blame, don't judge, a shark is a shark, just examine. I would really recommend some light philosophy, something like the [school of life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqhUHyVpAwE) or 'sophie's world'. It really helped me in my 20s when I was searching for answers.

Also always remember you are not responsible for the actions of others, even those that should always be on your side, like a father. He has let you down, and that's on him, not you.
