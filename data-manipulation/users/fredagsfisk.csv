Yes... much later, after the Dissident Priests had taken power and remade things, which happened *after* the Red Year.  
  
> not only that, but Morrowind wasnt in any danger of fracturing? morrowind seemed fine for years after that until the Oblivion Crisis hit  
  
I'm talking about a much longer time period than just a handful of years. We do not actually know that they ""seemed fine"", as there is very little information about the details of Morrowind's internal politics during that very short period other than;  
  
1) There is a deepening religious schism in the country, and a bubbling conflict between the Tribunal Temple and Dissident Priest heretics.  
  
2) They were abandoned by the Empire and left to deal with the OC themselves, which led to Hlaalu losing Great House status and Redoran dominating.  
  
3) The New Temple founded by the Dissident Priests did *not* exist until several years after the Red Year.  
  
... none of which are really things you'd want around for a nice and stable government/state.  
  
> The destruction of Vivec City and the subsequent eruption of Red Mountain in 4E 5 was not just a crisis in terms of the physical destruction it caused - it also cut deeply into the ancient religious beliefs of the Dunmer. **The fall of the Ministry of Truth was the last straw** in the tottering support for the Temple's worship of Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec. With all three of the Tribunes now widely believed dead or disappeared, what had been a simmering schism within the ranks of the Temple priesthood burst into the open.

Then why would Sheo throw it in the first place?  
  
> wasnt it enough that he stopped it in the first place? no, you just had to let it float as a monument to your godly power  
  
I'm of the opinion that Vivec did what he did on purpose, for the sake of the Dunmeri people.  
  
It was not public knowledge that the Tribunal was gone, and the higher ranking Tribunal priests had nothing to gain and *everything* to lose by a change to the status quo. Thus, it was in their best interest to secretly pretend the Tribunal were still giving orders from the shadows, and that everything was business as usual.  
  
With the Nerevarine's return emboldening the Dissident Priests, the Temple would have to crack down harder and harder on heresy. Baar Dau still being kept aloft is at this point the only public proof of their legitimacy.  
  
Thus, you have a religious civil war brewing in Morrowind. One side is the Tribunal Temple, with Ordinators, Buoyant Armigers, and increasingly fortified strongholds. On the other, you have Dissident Priests, Ashlanders, and their loyalists. It's anyone's guess which Great and Minor Houses would get involved, and on which side.  
  
However, when Baar Dau struck, it instantly removed all legitimacy of the Tribunal Temple. It was a scream that echoed to all Dunmer everywhere; *I am no longer here*. ""Coincidentally"", it also eradicated two of the main strongholds of the Temple (Vivec City, Ghostgate), forcing the Temple to surrender to the new order.  
  
This may have been Vivec's plan all along. He should have at least suspected that the Tribunal Godhood would have to end at some point, and made arrangements for such an event. Thus, he sets up a dead man's switch to (upon his removal) wipe out the old and make way for the new.  
  
Had this not happened, Morrowind might have been permanently broken apart by civil wars and religious schisms. Now, instead, they are forced into the future. Two decades of horrific disasters to prevent something far worse, and all in line with the most central tenents of ancient Dunmeri culture; strength through the overcoming of trials and adversity."

Not in the same way as in the sequel trilogy, but it did exist in a couple of different forms;  
  
The Aing-Tii used a version called *fold space*, which bent space to teleport objects (the Aing-Tii used it on their ships to move through space rather than Hyperdrive). Luke and a few other Jedi also learned it, but it wasn't really used on any larger scale (or in combat).  
  
There was also one simply known as *teleport*, used by Dathomiri Nightsisters, The Ones, and a few Sith. This power should also be present in Canon, as it was shown in several episodes of *The Clone Wars*.

todayilearned,fefdyvu,t3_eosgcx,1579054278.0,"Gustav III is probably the most interesting of the Swedish kings, in my opinion, even disregarding the coffee experimentation.  
  
**The Background**  
  
After the death of Karl XII (the guy who invaded Russia) in 1718, the Riksdag (Parliament) managed to move most power away from the monarch, giving themselves power of legislation and putting the Riksråd (Council of the Realm) as the government and supreme court.  
  
From 1719 to 1772, Sweden went through the Age of Freedom. It gained increased legal certainty, freedom of the press, and slight improvements towards democracy. During this time, there were two main political factions; Hattarna (The Hats, supported by France) and Mössorna (The Caps, supported by England/Russia).  
  
After the Hats had drawn Sweden into two devastating wars, losing parts of Finland and splintering the party, the Caps gained long-term power. Gustav III saw this as a threat, knowing the Caps were friendly with Russia.  
  
**The Coup**  
  
Gustav III led the officers of Livgardet (the [royal guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svea_Life_Guards)) and Stockholm city guards to arrest the government and seize the Stockholm castle. After successfully going through with the arrests, Gustav III rode around to the various military headquarters, having the artillery, cavalry and navy swear loyalty to him. The regiment that was marching towards the city to arrest the king were instead met by his officers, and swore loyalty as well.  
  
Thus, the coup (at the time known as The Revolution) ended after one day, also putting an end to the Age of Freedom and restoring monarchic power. Carl Michael Bellman wrote [Gustav's Toast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustafs_sk%C3%A5l) to commemorate the events.  
  
**The Reign**  
  
Gustav III ruled as a modern despot, and considered himself an ""enlightened despot"". What democratic process had been made was removed, but class differences were slightly loosened. Freedom of the press was greatly curtailed, and heavy censorship put in place as a response to the French Revolution.  
  
The King banned torture and severely limited the death penalty, legalized Catholic and Jewish presence in the country, and enacted many reforms for economic liberalism and social reform, as well as overhauling and improving the justice system. He also introduced [the national costume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationella_dr%C3%A4kten) in an attempt at limiting consumption among the middle class and nobility, considering overconsuption and luxury imports to be a drain on the economy and detrimental to society.  
  
Gustav III also loved culture very much, leading to heavy investments in theatres, ballet, opera, museums, and various other types of art. He was a patron to many painters, sculptors and musicians, both Swedish and non-Swedish.  
  
**The Wars**  
  
Wanting to be seen as a great warrior king, Gustav also tried to start several wars. He conducted a false flag attack to justify starting a war against Russia, as the constitution and Riksdag prevented him from being the aggressor in a war, but the Swedish fleet was crushed, forcing him to concede.  
  
After officers in Finland attempted a rebellion (which quickly collapsed), he forced through a new constitution, giving himself increased power at the expense of the nobility.  
  
Finally, he attempted to create a coalition to assault France, hoping to end the revolution and restore the monarchy, but this plan failed as well, since only Russia showed any interest.  
  
**The End**  
  
21 years into his rule, Gustav III was assassinated by nobles who were hoping to once again reform the government and move power away from the monarch again. He had been warned of the plot, but went to his planned masquerade anyways, hoping to project strength by showing he was not afraid. He was shot, and died a week later of his injuries."

In a way, I feel like it mirrors the French Revolution quite a bit. The overthrowing of the authority is acceptable, understandable, and even laudable, *but*... it was followed by *another* form of tyranny.  
  
During the French revolution, this tyranny took the form of the Reign of Terror, with tens of thousands executed or assassinated for various accusations. Squealer, on the other hand, reduces the former queen to a mindless breeding machine, wipes out other colonies, betrays his former friends, uses a brainwashed child soldier (with plans to get more), and attempts to commit total genocide."
ElderScrolls,fe7ihm8,t1_fe7dek8,1578914982.0,"> Lastly, the Nerevarine did not help the Dunmer. His actions lead to the collapse of the Temple and religious upheavel throughout Morrowind. It was his actions that set in motion not only the death of the Tribunal, but the fall of Bar Dau and the eruption of Red Mountain. His actions caused the struggles of the Dunmer.  
  
Well, you have to see it from a Dunmeri cultural standpoint, rather than a human one. For the Dunmer, willing or not, that *is* help.  
  
With the Tribunal slowly losing power, the Temple were cracking down on dissidents more and more, leading to an increasingly authoritarian and stagnant state. If the Nerevarine had not defeated Dagoth Ur, he would have caused further stagnation by turning everything into an extension of himself by way of the Divine Disease.  
  
Change is vital to Dunmeri society; to move forward, to overcome adversity and tests, and Baar Dau is vital in bringing about this change.   
  
Had the Tribunal simply faded away (as they at some point must), the Temple would have strengthened their hold on Morrowind. They would have fortified their positions and cracked down harder than ever on heretics. They would pretend Vivec was still there, giving them orders from the shadows, while only the leadership would know the truth.  
  
Meanwhile, the Dissident Priests, Ashlanders, and others unhappy with the Tribunal would still be emboldened by the appearance of the Nerevarine (again, vital to get rid of Dagoth Ur). The result would be massive rebel factions fighting against heavily entrenched traditionalists, with Houses great and minor joining over time. It would lead either to Temple victory (and long term stagnation) or the fracturing of the entire province/nation.  
  
Instead, Baar Dau falls. The first impact obliterates Vivec City, destroying the main Temple stronghold, loudly and clearly sending Vivec's message to the Dunmeri people; *I am no longer here*. It is undeniable. It makes it impossible for the Temple to deny that the Tribunal era has passed. Further, the secondary effect, the Red Year, destroys Ghostgate (also one of the main Temple strongholds).  
  
The Red Year and what followed made stagnation impossible. It forces the Dunmer into the future, kicking and screaming. Vivec's positioning of the rock, and Nerevarine's actions in causing it to fall (even if unintended) fulfils some of the most important tenents of the original Dunmeri society; it forces change. It gives the Dunmer trials to overcome. It forces the survivors to grow stronger, and to adapt.  
  
Out of the twenty-something years of seemingly neverending disaster rises a new order, with House Redoran at the helm of a surprisingly united Morrowind. The Dunmer are rebuilding, and moving forward, all while once again embracing what *truly makes them Dunmer*."
