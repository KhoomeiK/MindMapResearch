AdviceAnimals,ff9i7ky,t1_ff8mrow,1579713562.0,"just like there is a heads and a tails of a coin, DNC and RNC are part of the same coin.Yes, they have different stated goals, but their interests are very much aligned in many ways.  The largest issue with politics in my opinion is the undue influence of money in government.  I have argued with people on both sides that say essentially the same thing: "" oh those guys over there take money from special interests"".  both parties are swamped in money.  Repubs tend to favor the energy sector (im generalizing) and Dems tend to favor the finance sector.  Another (maybe outdated) generalization is that Rep did well with individual donations and Dems got PAC money. To say one or the other is not beholden to special interests (Dems love to say this) is a fat ass lie.  

I have been thinking money in politics has been our #1 issue since the 90s.  When the top 0.26% of people contribute 68% of lobbying and campaign contributions, and considering the fact these campaigns now more than ever rely on money, it is easy to conclude that the top 1% of the population has a larger voice than the bottom 99% of the population WHICH IS WHOM THE GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT.

Since the 90s, this amount of spending has increased from 3.3 billion to 12.9 billion as of 2012.  it is 2020.  do you think that number went down?

Many americans agree with me on this issue.   That is how I can say that the popularity of Trump and Bernie can be attributed, in part, to this.  They are both outsiders.  Their views couldnt be more different, but they occupy the votes of the disenfranchised on both ends of the political spectrum.

If you take a look at how the Dems (and the media, because lets face it, they are an arm of the donors that fund both parties) treat Gabber and Sanders, it is obviously biased against them.  Bernie got screwed last time by Hillary and the DNC is working against him again because having an establishment Dem in the white house is too important.  I would even say its important to the point of risking an election.  Reps have the same issue, but I think they are a bit smarter in that they will stop the BS and back a winning horse (Trump).  

Another thing:  One thing both parties agree on is 3rd parties.  if you want action in politics, just introduce a strong 3rd party candidate.  Next time we get one, just watch how the media and the parties collectively ignore this person.  it is astounding.  we have had candidates in the past that were in 2nd or 3rd place, yet when the news reports on them, they are omitted entirely or placed last.  I wish i had handy documentation, but not right now.  When it was only a 3%total vote requirement to get federal funding, we had a candidate get 2.7% or so.  So both parties voted to up it to 5%. surprise!  Then when the official presidential debates are taking place on whatever channel won the privilege (CNN, MSNBC, or whoever) only the Dems and Reps are invited.  just two.  wheres the third person that funded their campaign themselves?  excluded from the debate.  thats where.

So I guess you can call me a one issue voter.  When Hillary cheated Bernie, I refused to vote for her.  I didnt vote for trump, but if I felt my vote mattered (non battleground state) I would have.  Having a non establishment politician in office is more important than which side i vote for.  does it matter? probably not.  But If I am in a non battleground state or voting in smaller elections, I always vote third party, mostly.  good example: say a Libertarian is running but is also the Rep ticket.  there is usually 2 spaces with their name.  one for Rep and one for Lib.  i check Libertarian.  same guy, different party.  Green or Dem? Green party.

Other things:  The Trump presidency has been interesting.  I disagree on many issues that he has acted on, but some interesting things have come to light because of him.  As a person that generally leans left, he has exposed a very toxic underbelly of liberals.  its weird to watch.  You have a whole section of liberals that are so rabid that they refuse to even discuss anything with conservatives.  outrage, ingoring, cancelling have all been standard operating procedure for a significant section of liberals.  Its disappointing.  It makes Republicans seem very tolerant and reasonable, by comparison.  You may not like all of their ideas, but you can agree to disagree and still have a civil discussion.  I think that liberal media nad the DNC has been quite alright with whipping the far left into a tizzy.  It works to their favor.  it makes Trump look so horrible that anyone left of center want to vote Dem, no matter who it is.  The kooks will support candidates they dont want (Bernie) and make reasonable liberals think twice before voting for him.

Here is where I think they may be wrong.  they are underestimating the distaste Americans have for the establishment.  They see the media as a puppet for these special interests and know where the money for politicians comes from.  Thats how we got Trump.  People willing to burn the house down to get change.  Maybe I am projecting my feelings onto others, but when he won , I thought ""lol, good.  sometime you gotta break it to fix it. fuck 'em.""

Yet here we are in another election cycle and the DNC is pulling the same shit.  I fully believe that Pelosi held the impeachment in order to screw bernie.  the media is playing right along with the idea that Bernie (who has been the champion of regular people his entire life, consistently) would tell Warren that she cant win because she is a woman.  Lets watch and see more to find out if my claims have any merit."
