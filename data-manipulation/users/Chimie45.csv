Is it job training? Are we going to college to learn how to do a job? If so, surely we could do more to prepare people for job training. Companies are barely involved and there is no hands on training, it's all mostly theoretical work.

Is it further education? Then why is it that we're required to pick majors, why is it that we dont treat it like year 13/14/15/16 of general education? Why are we paying to do it. 

The issue is we're trying to do both and failing at both. 

If I'm going for a business degree to get into a marketing company, why am I studying Biology? Why am I being graded on History classes?

It might be true (and tbh sounds reasonable) but at the same time holds such an amount of data to be nearly inconsequential. Much like how if you averaged every stores user entering a store you'd get a lot more coffee shops and 7/11s and a lot less car dealerships and Pradas. You're also getting a lot more Indian/Chinese stores than anywhere else. Not to mention a lot of places selling things don't want you to actually enter the building. (like a construction company). 

For me clicks are a useful puzzle piece, but are ultimately just another brick of data. In mobile gaming CPI (Cost per Install) is still king over CPM (Cost per Mile--1000 views) or CPC (Cost per Click).

Your spending habits are that you don't click on links and other than one or two minor purchases you don't pay for things in apps. 

What this tells the algorithm is

`1. Don't show him ads for packages in game. `  
Many games know if you're a spender or not before you even install. They'll pop up special deals and sales for you right off the bat. Others know you won't spend so they show you more ads.

`2. Be careful about the types of ads you show him.`  
Interstitial banner ads are mostly useless for you, so instead they offer you rewarded ads--when you die they give you the feature to watch an ad for an extra life more. 

They increase the number of native ads on your Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and Twitter. 

`3. He's a prime candidate for A/B Testing, Brand Marketing, or PSA/Political Marketing.`  
Not all ads are made with the intention of selling you something then and there. Some aren't even meant to sell you anything. Many marketing companies will use people like you as a control group for their testing purposes. Others like Coca Cola or Tesla or whatever know you're a perfect target for Brand Marketing. They don't want to sell you anything now. Just subtly remind you they exist. And lastly, even if you don't buy anything, you might donate to a charity, political party, or religious organization.

As with in real life, there's not a whole lot of things I can glean from your fingerprint by itself. 

But just like if you could connect to a fingerprint database at a police station, you can connect with Ad Agencies and Big Data firms to connect the dots. 

So for example, I have user `D7146773-F88D-4290-88C6-588FEB1A7A78` who is from France, installed over 7 days ago (Loyal), is a user who has logged on in the past 3 days (Active), has over 10 sessions in the past 3 days (Engaged), and has spent over $20 lifetime (Paying). 

But that's all I know. It's a great set of data about the user, but again, still very limited to my own internal analysis.

Facebook however, among other services, has more data. They're not willing to share the data, but they'll let us use it. 

What it means is, we take a user like `D7146773-F88D-4290-88C6-588FEB1A7A78` and plug him or her into Facebook and Facebook will connect the IDFA `D7146773-F88D-4290-88C6-588FEB1A7A78` and **FACEBOOK** will see it as:

`Paul Bisset - User, Nice France, iPhone 10, 42 years old, Interests - RPG games, Old Stamps, WWII History;`
Related:
`Marianne Bisset - Wife, Nice France, Android (Samsung Galaxy J5), 41 years old, Interests - Sewing, Figure Skating, Baking;` 
`Michelle Bisset - Daughter, Paris France, iPhone 11, 19 Years old, Interests - Shopping, Rap, Fashion blogs.`

#Note: We do not see any of this data

Most users churn out before 30 days anyways, so there's very little use in trying to pay to keep users in a specific game. If the user is going to stay in game, it's the live operations team's job anyways so we don't really care if the user leaves or not to be honest, we've already gotten the use out of this user. 

First, we want more users like Paul. He spent a decent chunk of money! Surely users like him will get us more revenue. Well, Facebook (and other companies) have the ability to make 'Look-A-Like' Targeting for ads. Meaning we give it the ADID or IDFA of someone who did something we like (purchase, active, subscriptions, etc.) and give it to facebook and select how similar we want the new people to be (99%, 98%, 95%, 85% are the usual benchmarks I use) and Facebook will build an audience of people who might like our game based on their similarities to Paul.

But we have another RPG coming down the pipeline as well and so we want to target Paul again. We can just give our Advertising partners his direct ADID/IDFA and have them target him specifically. 

Finally, we have a studio we partner with to publish another title--they don't work with us on this title, but they are willing to pay us $10,000 for a list of all our French iOS users who are male, as they're coming out with an F1 Racing Game and that's one of their key markets. So we can sell them a list of Fingerprints which let them advertise to you directly. 

If you ever go into your Facebook Ad Preferences sometimes you'll see 'Companies or Pages that are targeting you directly' and see like... an absolute shitton of Car Dealerships or Cosmetics Brands. This is basically because your ADID was in some list that got sold to a re-selling company which sold the leads out to others again.

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. :)"
explainlikeimfive,ffqpal9,t1_ffq36f3,1580140469.0,"Realistically, no one sells the 'User Data'. We don't really know it. We as devs don't know what your gender is, or a lot of other critical information unless you specifically provide it. Even then most users won't provide it so we don't even bother asking.

We know where you came from (downloaded our game), Where you're from (IP address/Store), When you play and how much you play, and most critically, how much you spend.

But Facebook knows who you are, what your gender is, who your friends are, what your interests are, and where you live.

And what we have is your ADID, or your unique phone ID, which conveniently, Facebook knows too. 

So what we can do is sell your ADID to another company as 'These are users who have made purchases in game' or 'These are users who have played for 50 days or more', or whatever valuable action they're looking for. 

Then, they can upload the list of IDs to Facebook, and Facebook will match with profiles and such, still unable to be seen by the marketing company--only by Facebook, but then the company will be able to target by whatever internal data they want."
explainlikeimfive,ffqotex,t3_eukkeu,1580140142.0,"Wow hey a topic I'm an expert at!

Well, the basic idea is that when you show an ad for your game in another game, you're paying in CPM, or 'Cost Per Mile' which means 1000 views. 

One ad can get millions of views per day or even hour if the budget is high enough.

The goal then, is to get the users to come to your game and filter through your business model--whether that be in game purchases, in game ads, subscriptions, rewarded ads, or offer walls.

If you run an action game called Ninja Attack and I have an RPG game called Ninja Hero Gaiden, chances are players of your game might want to play my game too. So I would contact an advertising company like Google, Facebook, Unity, or Ironsource to get advertising. 

The key is the Business Model. Do I make my money from advertising or from in game purchases?

If it's from advertising, the goal is simple, make you play long enough to see more ads than I paid for. 

More likely thought, it's to get you to come and play the game and spend money. 

One user out of 100 coming and spending $1 will net me 10x what I spend. Worth it."

I loved watching Robin Williams movies. I grew up listening to Linkin Park as a teen. Both influenced me but neither one changed the world. I mourned when Robin and Chester passed, because with them part of my childhood also passed I mourned because they meant something to me.
