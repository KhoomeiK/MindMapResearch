The single object was present (with the money) and tagged at a price. The buyer was aware it was used & technically a one-off and all the faults and problems that go with it; caveat emptor but not for the seller eh? Would the loose change be required to be returned from the cushions?"

Why if its in an envelope does the seller get it back, does paper insulate it from the transaction? I bought a storage locker at auction and in it was several hundred dollars in coins and USD. I bought the contents of something and some of the something happened to be money. I didn't have to return that. Sounds like some shit a bank would push to have overarching rights to anything found in a gray area. The law needs to make sense. You should vet what you donate thoroughly,  they should vet what they sell at the thrift store, you should get what you buy with its contents unless otherwise specified.

If it isn't do think he informed his other gang members (a trustworthy bunch to tell your stash spot to) that he had the 43k and it was in his couch? Then when he dies no one goes and retrieves the funds while the drug kingpin's estate is being wound down. After missing that window they theorize that their missing money must've been in the mans sofa that went to a thrift store. Instead of going there and buying the couch they wait for it to be sold and have to muscle a clerk for info on the buyer of said couch. Once known, they get an address and go kill and/or rob unsuspecting civilian of the 43k. Yeah that sounds like a real plausible scenario to me and one that warrants concern.........."

worldnews,ff2oh69,t1_ff1ot2m,1579516373.0,"Well then you missed some of the point; much like many who think there are climate deniers. No one is doubting climate change, to the contrary, many certainly acknowledge the climate is changing. What is in question is the mechanisms at play which are causing said changes. Unfortunately many on the left believe in a very dangerous form of censorship called ""settled science"". That is the statement of lunatics. Anything ""settled"" needn't be called that so to call that something proves it is indeed unsettled. Anyway there are people who believe that the ways and methods being used to measure the factors and which factors are being measured are falling short. Who decides what we look at in terms of what causes climate change? How are we certain all areas have been accounted for? By the settled science way of doing it we no longer need to examine any other factors right? You have properly measured EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTOR TO THE PROBLEM? Of course you haven't. Since you haven't then the blame being assigned to all the parts you do think are the cause is fundamentally flawed because the unknown unassigned areas portions are given to the one area no one can as yet quantify - man. We become the junk drawer catchall for the factors that science has failed to identify as a cause. Not to mention no one is looking for either. Remember? All the geniuses got together and said it was settled. That's why censorship of this type is dangerous and discourse should never be abandoned. I say shame on the left for self-righteous indignation that stifles science and puts on blinders."
space,ff2hgz7,t1_ff2e9wy,1579506321.0,Terra formation by electrical discharge by a close-passing body. I'm sure there are a few that are meteors but if you look closely at the craters there are many that resemble arc discharge of an EDM (electric discharge machine) used to make (e.g.) o-ring grooves in metal instead of standard tool machining. I'm no expert by any means but if you look into the Electric Universe theory they have tons of information on it.  Mars especially. Mind-blowing stuff that flies in the face of conventional theories. Makes way more sense than the standard model. From a lay-perspective. If you are interested look up the Thunderbolts Project on Youtube. Fascinating stuff and worth looking into if the universe's operation is of interest.

Purpose irrespective of truth was a common motivator. Losing such a valuable tool is beyond disheartening. The door is  closing in a permanent way.

Open censorship,  wild suppression of free speech, promoting groupthink mobs refusing to even engage in discourse, echochambers validating erroneous conclusions on every aspect of society including science.

Frankly if you were so adamant that someone was lying to you that you would be putting forth a half-assed attempt to discredit their words. Did you even look into what was said before taking such a stance? The statement was made and then supported by a second individual which is a bit more than your ""liar, liar your pants are on fire"" response that is a dumbassed argument to boot.

 I love typo queens; you know some people actually engage in discourse with people from other countries that are using English as a second language in order communicate with diverse points of view.

Foodforthought,fd85u99,t1_fd5ts22,1578214232.0,"I am not up to speed on the blockchain to comment on its long-term applications as relates to governments. I do know this though - governments are by definition control freaks and crypto is not able to be controlled. One of the two must change but to do so would destroy the conventional definition and essence of the changed to the point they are no longer recognisable. I do not think these two can exist at the same time and place to assimilate crypto.  I know that banks have stated and several are researching starting their ""own crypto"" which proves they either 1 don't understand how it works or 2 are relying on the fact that many people don't get how it works either but trust banks so they blindly follow. 

In any case governments and crypto will cross swords at some point and as for now there is a fiat currency in competition with FRN,  that usually ends at a noose or jail cell for the peddler of that competition. It actually does fiat better than the Fed because they have a name and several faces crypto literally doesn't. It's more fiat than fiat is fiat. May just be the edge crypto needs to beat the FRN. It'll be interesting."
Foodforthought,fd5hidj,t1_fd32hjd,1578177708.0,"I wish I knew.  I own a small business with 21 employees.  I pay them more than industry standard and consider profit to be January 1, lights on and doors open. The problem lies in our debt-based fiat currency and the private bankers we allowed to capture our economy. 

I don't want to hijack a thread but the problems are actually not that hard to fix in terms of currency and economic health. It would take a year to execute but prosperity would be on the other side. Abolish the Fed, issue Treasury Notes as replacements for FRN. The notes would be swapped at banks and everyone would have 365 days to swap them. It is utterly insane that we allow a private bank to print our currency and then charge us interest to do so. It's why inflation exists and the boom bust cycle occurs. If we were to eliminate our debts we would literally eliminate our own money.  Every dollar in circulation is a dollar owed to someone else and it isn't us. 

Then our issued treasury notes would begin to work for us. Any interest charged would be returned to the Treasury (currently we are only paid a share of the interest on printed money only…… 97% is not printed). You can do some interesting things too…… for starters there is no servicing debt to speak of as we wouldn't charge our public works interest on projects.  No more compound interest. You could also offer low or no interest loans to DBEs and starting to help launch new business and stimulate the economy.  When you as a country control your currency,  crazy crazy things can happen. Just ask muammar gaddafi…. Oh yeah you can't. Central Bankers had him removed. Cant have good examples of how to run a country with resources AND ZERO DEBT. 

Just ask yourself why this country abolished central banking 5 times in history prior to 1913. A year that saw the start of inflation and the implementation of income tax…… gee I wonder why?"
Foodforthought,fd2vqp3,t1_fcz5fli,1578152120.0,"Capitalism is fine for about 1% of the population. I never understood how anyone could look at such a corrupt system and push it as the best we got. 

On its face it has a guiding principle that is sure to play a role in its demise. As a company the goal is to charge people the maximum amount of money I can possibly get while providing an object with the cheapest materials and lowest skilled labor that will be minimal but passable as the product. This atmosphere is cultivated to its max when the monopolies have absorbed or destroyed the competition and the purchased polititians run effective interference. 

I think it is a mistake to call it corrupt or crony or a ""version"" or anything but capitalism.  We didn't change cars mid-journey…… we tried that system and it has failed.  The form it became it became while labelled as capitalism so we can design the next system free from those who would support capitalism again by saying it wasn't a real try at it and we should give it another go.

If your studies cited are the NIST reports you should avoid quoting studies in your arguments.  That birdcage lining was a riot to read.  I assume you read it right?  Your ilk attack the use of FEA while supporting the fictional scenarios that the Department of Commerce funded NIST ( they actually used a theory that posited the shotgun blast removal of fire retardant protection). FEA is utilised routinely for all manner and kind of mechanical analysis. It sure does beat the explanation given by NIST that illustrates the collapse….. Oh wait. Thats right NIST says basically - we saw the planes go into the buildings, we saw the buildings fall therefore the planes caused the fall. None of their scenarios can be said to work if the fire protection is in place. I mean NEVER,  in the history of skyscrapers has a concrete reinforced steel structure fallen due fire yet on 911 there were 3. Any since that day?  Nope.  Any building code changes as a result of the day's events?  Nope. 

Your wonderboys at NIST also failed to validate the actual collapse sequence….. Ha.  Why see if the failures you are citing can be used to simulate the actual observed scenario? In essence you could model your hypothesis and see if it is matched in current FEA analysis…..analysis works both ways you know.  They couldn't even bullshit the math on WTC 7. It was what?  5 years late and they even stated it wasn't really accurate. 

So go ahead and call a University engineering department a bunch of liars for another bunch of practicing real-world engineers that aren't a part of their actual profession but a bunch of ""truthers"" as opposed to M.E. and E.E. and P.E. doing daily design work and have examined the facts from that building and that day and arrive at a different, valid conclusion that runs contrary to people who could be just as biased as you claim they are.
