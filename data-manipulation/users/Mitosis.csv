I find that ""because I'm educated"" response pretty silly and somewhat sad that anyone feels the need to disparage where they come from like that. An accent neither implies improper English nor lack of education or intelligence.

politics,ff3gcvf,t1_ff3drwb,1579540476.0,"It *probably* would take an amendment. It would certainly need to be some kind of sweeping campaign finance reform (that is highly unlikely to happen anyway).

For any who want more info: The gist of the Citizens United case was that a company put out an anti-Hilary Clinton documentary and was challenged by the FEC based on laws about companies putting out political ads in proximity to an election. 

Citizens United made this movie specifically because earlier attempts to restrict advertising and distribution of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, an anti-George Bush documentary, under the same acts were denied by the FEC, claiming that film represented ""bona fide commercial activity.""  Basically, the FEC said one political movie was not campaigning material, so Citizens United made their own documentary that the FEC claimed was campaigning material. Hence the lawsuit.

This essentially caused a spiral effect on examining previous rulings and existing laws about who can spend political money where and when, and the conclusion of the majority was that the distinctions were too arbitrary (e.g. allowing ""media companies"" to present electioneering opinions, but not others) and ultimately unworkable within the framework of the first amendment. (Corporations, after all, are groups of people, all with first amendment rights, coming together for a purpose, much like e.g. unions and any other form of association.)

So yeah, since CU is predicated on the first amendment, Congress can't make a law saying ""corporations can't spend money."" I'm not sure how you'd get around the arguments as presented in CU regarding the first without a new amendment, though."

Even when not to the degree of politics, I try and steer away from any discussion about what you dislike. You see threads now and then like what music or video game do you hate that others love, and I have no idea what kind of benefit anyone hopes to get out of such a discussion, as tempting as it is to go in there and rail against things you hate.

It's difficult sometimes because people do tend to bond over a shared hatred far more than a shared like, but I find it makes for a much happier life."
