KeepOurNetFree,ffj2ltq,t3_etsxtz,1579988819.0,"I haven't read the article yet but as a longtime IT pro, I wonder if people consider the fact that even to this day, just because a utility is accessible to a larger metropolitan area, it doesn't mean it's accessible to those outside of it. Running utilities to every person in the US is still an incredible infrastructure investment and won't be possible to the 99.999% of addresses in the US. Private ISPs will always exist somewhere."

AskReddit,ffaprdh,t1_ffaonnc,1579741621.0,I loved them for their DIY electronics stuff.  It was the only place to find parts and components. Cables were tertiary for me most of the time. Of course this was in the late 90's. I missed the hey day of the 70's and 80's for electronica.

todayilearned,fdrgqt1,t1_fdrbyog,1578684290.0,I touched probably about a dozen in the few months I work for that ISP. I liked the physical design and how robust the OS felt. They did some major improvements in the UI between versions which helpee a lot of things. They got hot but we're at least run off of POE.
todayilearned,fdraw4a,t1_fdqrz8p,1578681903.0,I know of them but only because I worked for a small ISP that installed them for customer routers. I spent 20 years in IT and have never run into them anywhere else.
