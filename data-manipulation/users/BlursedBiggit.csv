ShitPoliticsSays,feva8u7,t1_fetgpzx,1579395012.0,"If you're getting a competitive salary *and* there's no employee contribution, there is no problem.

If you accept an offer where you're earning 20k less than average *because* there's no employee contribution, YOU are the problem. 

Every interview you ace doesn't have to end in accepting an offer. If it's not what you're looking for, thank them for their time and let them know you'll be available if they reconsider. They might not contact you, but they also might call you back before you even make it to your car."
