adhdwomen,ff737v3,t3_erxplg,1579640222.0,I've really been enjoying intermittent fasting. I find it gives me time to put thought into what I eat. I have been eating healthier and I'm only eating once a day so I eat whatever I want. I even drink beer as long as it's in my 4 hour window. Water tea and black coffee the rest of the day. I was hard for the first couple weeks and I take breaks but I definitely have more energy and a better relationship with food when I'm fasting.
