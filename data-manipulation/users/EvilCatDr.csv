AskEngineers,ff62vyj,t1_ff5zt3k,1579617763.0,"my last company was the opposite. They did not promote from within unless you were superstar and higher level management already.

Usually, for entry to mid, they would give you promotion every 2-3 yrs, but not much else"
AskEngineers,ff54ycl,t3_erd793,1579580365.0,"Begin making 1 PowerPoint with a portfolio of all your work that is short and concise per project except for 1 project that you go into depth.

At 6 months before moving, begin applying for every job at possible locations

Ask for a raise listing why you deserve it. If they don't budge, wait till the offers come in and ask again when you have an offer to force their hand.

Network with upper management or HR."

Mix tanks
Industrial ovens
Peelers
Water cleaning
GMP
Cyclone separators
Fermentation
Psychometric charts
Unsteady state heat transfer
Viscosity of non Newtonian and Newtonian solutions
Pumps
Homogenizers

And that should be good enough. Im not saying equations, values, etc, but big picture how they work, how to select the right one, and rule of thumb concepts"

AskDocs,fcbexdg,t3_egt0tt,1577586022.0,"Not a (medical) doctor but he needs to be flossing at least once a day and using mouthwash. Also, scrape the tongue to remove extra bacteria living there. Also, is he going to the dentist twice a year? Even if nothing is wrong, it is important to get the scrape cleaning for prevention.

Does his breath smell acidy like vomit or a roadkill like something died? That way you can figure out if it is bacterial in the mouth or from his stomach.

Can you elaborate on his diet very specifically?"
ChemicalEngineering,f5ke39j,t1_f5kd0f1,1572261151.0,I had gotten through HR and the entire engineering before. My resume is fine. It is I'm just in the dark as to what was wrong or the impasse
