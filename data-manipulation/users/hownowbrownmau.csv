I often wonder why that is. Is it truly a difference in experience? Is it underlying gender dynamics in society?

But I do think there is a difference in experience especially if you’re geographically located in the Bible Belt.

I'm also in Houston and I've bought and sold a lot of homes. Here's the deal - the seller making concessions or not is not something to ""read into.""  There are a lot of reasons why a seller wouldnt make concessions: 1) They can't afford to reduce the price any further 2) They simply dont want to. 3) They're in an area they know will get an offer no matter what 

Also your inspector is super anal (""thorough"" is a better word, but I want to just be accurate to my tone). Its a good thing. Keep his number, use him next time. His strategy is clearly the ""point everything out under the sun and let the buyer determine risk"" which means you need to really figure out for yourself how much each item is an issue. (I realize this is what you're doing here, but i'm suggesting some google searching as well). He's definitely pointed out some things that would make me laugh  - things nearly every house in all of houston has an issue with type of things. I have a feeling what he's trying to do is make you aware of some possible concerns that if you see progressing, you know what exactly to address. 

Another thing to consider. I've purchased homes between new, 25 years old, 110 years old. The whole gamut. When buying a home, you need to remember that wear and tear is part of the cost of ownership. SoOOO many people think the cost of ownership is their mortgage, taxes and interest. Nope. In addition, the house's value isn't based on wear and tear items. A new roof is a nice to have marketing angle when selling a house, but no one in the world is deducting 7 grand from the cost of a house because the roof needs to be redone. Real estate pricing is mostly on supply/demand and location. Everything on your inspection report that is wear and tear (roof etc), you should be prepared to pay for it either in this house or the next. The question shouldn't be whether or not you'll pay for it. The question should be a matter of WHEN. No matter what, you should be budgeting for this. I'm just not going to comment on wear and tear items. My suggestion is: be prepared to pay for it if you love this house. And be prepared to save up for it if you buy another.

So lets go through this...

Trees close to house - find out how old the tree is. If the tree is mature and there isn't foundation issues, its not likely to change. Its not ideal by any means. I'm not saying its not a cause for concern. I'm saying this is not remotely new. So many houses have this. No all trees are going to destroy your foundation. Also find out where its located and whether its protected from wind. When a hurricane comes, you want the building to be blocking the tree or it might collapse into your home. if you dont like it, cut it down and grind down the stump. there isn't any foundation issue right now and you'll effectively stunt it from progressing. This is a ""deal with it in whatever way you will, you're a homeowner now"" (DWIIWWYWYAHN) item - remove it or fix it or keep it.  

Flower boxes near the house. Nearly EVERY HOUSE in the houston area has some sort of planting in this way. The box in the picture wouldnt concern me at all. Just make sure you're checking the area regularly for insect activity. The flower ""bed"" is below the foundation line. (DWIIWWYWYAHN)

EVERYTHING Roof: (DWIIWWYWYAHN). So many homes in the houston area have these issues. Its the way they're constructed. Monitor it, fix it if it becomes an issue. I wouldnt expect the seller to make concessions over these items. Kick out flashing? Seriously? If it becomes an issue, you know what to fix. 

Rain gutters and downspouts, Everything attic - (DWIIWWYWYAHN)

Siding and Rot: (DWIIWWYWYAHN). Houston homes. Houston homes. It will happen. I'm literally in the middle of fixing this with my home. 

Sealing: (DWIIWWYWYAHN)

Smoke Detectors and Wiring issues: I would ASK for a concession with these two items. I wouldnt be surprised if I didn't get it. (DWIIWWYWYAHN)

Ok. I stopped at page 39. Ran out of time. Theres so little on here that isn't normal to the home's age or construction to this area. Most of these items are things you should be aware of and can fix it if you'd like. To be honest, if I wouldnt expect the seller to concede these items. I would be very surprised if they did."

JUSTNOMIL,fekchxt,t3_epk5oo,1579197175.0,"Listen, there are all sorts of socially awkward people here on Reddit. Please keep that in mind when you receive advice. 

People like your mom are exhausting to deal with because you have to tread a fine line. The secret recipe is firm but kind. Your mom wants to feel loved and will feel threatened if you set a firm boundary because she will feel like your love for her is being chipped away. After all, she birthed you. (Something she most likely thinks).

The way you can do this is make her feel embarrassed but let her know you love her. Like ""eww mom, that does not feel good... How bout a hug instead."" You're not asking her to stop, youve shamed her into it. Obviously, I haven't spent time really thinking about what to say, but this is just an off the cuff example. 

I would not make a request in the same way we teach children to do stranger danger. It will not come off well. You can be effective without being dramatic. And it's more likely to be effective when you don't ""challenge"" someone to cross a boundary."

I don’t know. I just speak from my personal experience. My dad is one of 8. My mom is one of 6. My parents cousins are considered immediate family. The landscape of people is vast. Likely this ain’t the first time the family has pressured him. There is a feeling that it’s better to cave or lie than deal with it. And usually if you reach adulthood and haven’t learned mechanisms to deal with it, unless you’re a young adult (early 20s), it’s unlikely to change.

relationship_advice,fegkxxb,t1_fegfslv,1579095982.0,"Yes. It does take time.

He can have self esteem issues but when confronted with the insult to his girlfriend he withers. He has to be willing to fight for her.  He can be hurt, he can feel embarrassed but he has to know if she’s “right.”  

It’s a lifetime battle against a family like this without a strong partner to buffer it for your spouses. You have to protect your Significant other.

Edit:  I understand what I’m saying isn’t popular. Obviously, a counselor is needed no matter what OP chooses to do. I guess I just subscribe to philosophy that you can’t change people.

relationship_advice,fef0go4,t1_fee7zky,1579045282.0,"Agreed. OP, I come from one of these cultures. There is a common misconception, especially with people from less collective societies like the US, that you have to “cut out” people like this because they’re “toxic.” Yes, there are people who are truly worth cutting out. I have done so. But more often, we use this strategy so loosely we end up alone, with very few people to rely on        
People can be worthwhile and have behaviors and beliefs that aren’t healthy. In fact, that might be most of us. The good news is they can be managed just as stated in the comment above. 

My mom, super loving and caring woman can be petty about certain things. I was once in your boyfriends shoes. My husband is now my mother’s favorite person. My brother is currently in your boyfriends situation, with the family bearing down on him about his girlfriend. However, the key difference is that my brother has a spine and stands up for his girlfriend instead of rolling over and withering like a slug at the hint of saltiness. People who survive in collective societies NEED thick skins. 

You need to dump him. Not because of his family. They can be managed. And believe or not, can accept you truly and genuinely with time. But you can never fix a guy who had self esteem issues that will cave to a stronger family dynamic without a spine. He will always cave. The fact this has been a multi day issue is proof. If he stood his ground early and firmly, they wouldn’t be trying to weather him, they’d resign."

For the sake this argument whether or not government employees have a pension plan that can lead to early retirement, me having an in law in law enforcement, in research, at USPS, among others, has more information that is generalizable than you, a single PhD hellbent on validation.

Edit: it’s amazing how out of touch you are. I’m sure your job is worthwhile and necessary. But that is mutually exclusive to whether or not you have it good. I, too, have a career that is disproportionately paid to the general population and within my field there are countless who genuinely believe they aren’t paid enough without a thought about how our society doesn’t reward every employee commensurate to their contribution to the community. I know countless jobs that work harder, longer hours and make a fraction. I’m not so oblivious as to contribute to the false narrative.

But they They work in a variety of different government jobs from research to PD to postal office in five states. It’s a still a random sampling due to how varied the jobs are and the departments and the locations. And because it’s a close knit and non competitive family, we find out the inner workings of their salaries. 

And yes it is a high pension. It’s 70% of his final salary and since he worked lots of overtime due that final three years, it’s a good pension . 

You’re making a statement that “something doesn’t happen.”  I only need to prove that it happens once to disprove you. However I happen to have multiple examples.  If your statement wasn’t so absolutist and allowed for the possibility of something other than your situation perhaps we would be discussing something else.

Moreover, It’s completely and totally irrelevant to the point I’m continuing to make, which is there is a risk disparity between men and women that could be, but isn’t shared more equally.

Side note: probability incorporates all of these sources of variability and spits out on one pretty number that condoms are not effective.

Male birth control trials were halted because of the literal same symptoms that women experience with oral contraceptives were not acceptable to them. 

Oral contraceptives can mess with you. Make you feel tired, nauseous, gain weight, mess with your mood, make you depressed. Ask for a hysterectomy? Get denied because no one wants to risk permanently getting rid of fertility. Iuds? Painful to small uteruses. Reactive to those with eczema and autoimmune diseases. Women have to eat figurative sh** to protect themselves in a way men don’t and STILL get people like this guy/girl with “zero sympathy.”

I’m waiting for a male birth control that eliminates the need for women to take oral contraceptives or IUDs or other invasive measures so that women can be responsible for “condoms” only.

If you look hard enough we all participate in hypocrisy. We don’t all live carbon zero etc etc. but there is a line somewhere. There is a difference between the family that tries to reduce their impact and the people in McMansions who buy Tesla’s to do their share.

AskWomen,fdctph0,t1_fdcagrp,1578284031.0,"This was me. I became the “better than other girls”  inadvertently. 

I tried and tried to make friends with other girls in middle school and high school and that never got traction. I had friends but I was always the lowest on the totem pole or I wasn’t ever taken seriously or I was ignored. I was often made fun of for being different (short and not white).  I didn’t attract men (I wasn’t white). I was never the person people went to first, always the last resort. I didn’t realize at the time they weren’t really my friends, I was just a lackey amongst a group of mean girls. (Side note: they all grew up and became good people). 

Then I went to college as an engineering major among very few women at all. My program had one other woman. I didn’t change but all of the suddenly I had good friendships with men based on real things. I falsely interpreted that to mean that I didn’t get along with girls because I was different than other girls. The girls I had been friends with were mean and full of drama and I hated drama. I was really “logical” and it didn’t mesh well with these particular girls. It was easy for me to believe I was different when I found such a perfect niche in the engineering department surrounded by men who thought like me, talked like me, cared about the same things. 

It wasn’t well into my career that I learned that there were girls like me, i just gave up on women too early because I made bad friends early on. Now most of my friendships are with women, but I know how to pick them.  

Now as an adult, seeing those same girls grow up, I realized another thing: they all were playing a part, trying to fit some mold they thought they needed to fit. When they were free to become who they wanted, they ended up good people. They were mean because they were insecure and I was an easy target upon which to feel superior. 

I still catch and correct myself for feeling that way every now and then. One example, for instance, when I learned women are disproportionately more antivaxx then men by a large gap. I jumped to, “why are women so illogical?” But then I catch myself and remember the forces of society that have worked to create these dynamics (as one of many examples: we disproportionately blame mothers for things that go wrong with children so they are more fearful)"

If you look at the data (lots of data sets have been generated, they’re all about the same. Pew is one source) that generated this conclusion, they found that poverty was a statistically significant factor but there is a big difference between statistically significant and practically significant. The difference between the means between the groups of low socio economic backgrounds vs not is 28% vs 32%. The same effect size was seen between men and women. By  education. However, that’s at all squabbling over 2-3 percent. There is a baseline obesity that isn’t explained by gender, by wealth by other demographic factors. 

We spend so much time and money trying to sell solutions to food and poverty and education when really, it doesn’t explain the root cause of the 30% baseline - our intake, our lack of exercise, our lack of time, our backwards priorities, our culture that doesn’t promote health through balance."

plantclinic,fcufqc6,t3_eiz1hq,1577979871.0,"Mods: we need to have a pin that requires basic care details for every post. 

OP: Well a variety of things. But we can’t know anything until some basic Information is shared. How dry is the soil when you water. Where is it located. What kind of light does it get. Have you ever fertilized. Was it recently moved between dramatically different t temperatures. 

First probe a finger in an inch deep. How dry is the soil? If it’s bone dry, likely it’s been underwatered. You should always poke a finger in. The top of the probe should be dry and the bottom a bit moist before watering. Begin lifting the container to feel how heavy it is when it needs watering. And after watering. Always water evenly. Deeply and infrequently is better than lightly and frequently. 

Alternatively it could be a mineral imbalance or chemical burn. Do you feed with rainwater or tap or tap that has been left out to dechlorinate. If there is a mineral deficiency it could turn brown in the edges. But this looks more in the middle. 

Or maybe sun scorching. Has it been getting direct sun on its leaves? Bright indirect light is best for pothos even though they can tolerate a variety of conditions

Why is this far fetched for you? Germans killed millions Jews over false propaganda of economic insecurity. History is LITTERED with examples of this special insecurity cocktail that starts with an economic threat sprinkled with tribalism and a scape goat.  You begin the story with a threat of yanking cheap/free labor which is a direct determination of your margins on your major revenue  source, add in the ""north wants to control the south"" bullshit and the threat of a shared tax load (which the country needed and is still using) and 600,000 people WILL go to war over slaves. Its slaves. Slaves.

\>I've stood in the US where more American men died in less than two days than during the entire Vietnam conflict.

So? The number of people who have died has no bearing on the reasons for which they went to war.

\>Do yourself a favor and look up the long list of all our neighboring countries who abolished slavery without massive civil upheaval. Abolishment was inevitable, no war could have stopped it.

Irrelevant. What neighboring countries do is irrelevant to what we did. Your argument presumes that the majority of people in the south were aware of this inevitability. They werent. There is a lot of evidence from letters that show this.

\>Lincoln himself admitted that the war was an effort to restore tax enforcement.

No. Twisting language. The reason for the war wasn't tax enforcement but rather tax couldnt be enforced without a war.

\>Do some more research and find the buried original 13th Amendment that still sits in the House, awaiting ratification, that allows the new territories the right to sovereignty with regard to labor, so long as reunification follows.

no. irrelevant. The north did not go to war to abolish slavery. The north went to preserve the union. We do not conclude scientific truths with ONE study. We look at a BODY of research before we draw conclusions. Similarly, in history you dont pick obscure examples to prove a minor point where there is an overwhelming body of evidence that suggests something else. There is a reason why historians have a general consensus on the civil war. Read the secession letters. read [“Declaration of the Immediate Causes which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union.”](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_scarsec.asp)  You can also look up the same for Georgia, Texas, mississippi and viriginia. They list what they're pissed off about and why they're leaving. Its pretty f\*ing clear as day.

Its almost like the sky is blue, but you see the one white cloud and claim the sky is white. Thats what you're doing. You're taking a mountain of evidence, picking the most obscure examples and trying to inflate them in value. The major grievences for states rights revolved around slaves, the north's enforcement of fugitive slave act, whether they had the right to leave the union.

When you screw up in life, you own up and move on. You don't twist the original intention and try to make your intentions valid - the south's love for their own history needs to be weighed with morality of it."
