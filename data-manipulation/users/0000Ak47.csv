bipolar,feiwjwr,t1_feiw5f3,1579149166.0,"I think it’s more likely to be born with it but that’s my experience. I’ve been bipolar since I was a kid but I didn’t know until I was 23!!!! So it’s been a long path to self discovery. It might be developed but that’s not my case personally. Trying to speak from what I know, hope it’s answering something for you."

Latuda,fehr6re,t1_fegc1rc,1579122249.0,Idk. Ask my sensitive ass boobs and the fact I need all new bras now! Lol
