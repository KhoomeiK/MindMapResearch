sex,fdjstap,t3_elfmkx,1578486237.0,"My (34F) ex-husband was undiagnosed bipolar and became obsessed with religion. I am a very sexual person and always have been. He stopped sleeping in the bed with me, didn't want sex, and if we did have sex didn't want either of us to orgasm which I didn't follow through with because orgasming is hard for me so I'm not willing to give up the ones I can have.

He made me feel undesirable and also that sex is frivolous. There were other problems in the relationship  and I am so much happier with a caring partner now. It's been more than a year since the divorce but I'm still having an even more difficult time orgasming with a partner than before I was with him. Solo seems to be working fine lol."

tampa,fd22bws,t1_fd0otuh,1578140586.0,Meetup.com or the meetup app! I actually run a tarot group through it bc I wasn't seeing the type of thing I wanted to go to. I also forgot to say I met my dungeons and dragons friends of 2 years through a meetup. Meetup is for people who genuinely want to meet others with similar interests in person.

sex,fcqkqhm,t1_fcphvsw,1577887720.0,"I was thinking the same thing! I (34F) have an incredibly hard time orgasming. It puts so much pressure on me when sex partners are dissatisfied with sex bc *I* couldn't get off and I'm like wait didn't we have a fun time and you got off? It actually hapoened recently in a threesome where the woman was disappointed in herself she couldn't get me off and I had to comfort her about it! 


Luckily I'm with a guy who will spend a lot of time and energy on me to get me to orgasm but guess what, he is paraplegic and has ED because of it. It's harder for him to orgasm than it is for me and while I wish I could make it happen for him his sensation is too dull for it to be all on me, he literally has to meditate to orgasm. 


So really, each of us is responsible for our own orgasm and we should look at sex as having fun and a good time whether that orgasm happens or not. I am happy that OP was able to figure out how to solve his problem."
askwomenadvice,fcqhmxk,t1_fcpz4t9,1577886151.0,"I work out 3-4 times per week weight lifting and dancing. I have very similar hair: long, thick, slightly coarse and it will get frizzy if I wash every day (plus I'm in Florida). It also takes a long time to air dry and I hate blow drying. I wash with Aveda scalp solutions which is a deep cleaning shampoo. My water is hard so I add a TBSP of Apple cider vinegar to water that I rinse my hair with. When I firsr started washijg my hair lesd I did it every other day, then every third day, etc. Until I got up to a week between washing. During the week I brush my hair every day and it distributes the oil from my scalp down the hair strands."
AmItheAsshole,fcqgl0l,t3_eigcs9,1577885605.0,"ESH. She shouldn't have asked for forgiveness. If she wanted to apologize then do that but expect nothing in return. And for your part you could have said: ""you made my life very painful, it is still painful to think about today and while I'm happy you improved yourself I can't forgive those actions.""

I'm sorry that happened to you. High school was incredibly painful for me for different reasons and it's a time when we are developing so much. I'm glad you are able to go to therapy and that you have a family who cares for you."
offmychest,fcol4o3,t1_fcokccd,1577834971.0,"His doctor has never prescribed him pills I don't think. He's a veteran and we are near one of the best VA spinal cord centers in the US so I assume they told him what was best for him.

The med is Alprostadil. When we first started seeing each other 2 years ago (in our early 30s) he had a lot of it bc he wasn't dating much (same problem as you, the wheelchair) and in less than a year I had depleted his several year supply of meds lmao. We have been rationing them to about 1 a week now plus we have a private insurance prescription in addition to his VA prescription."
offmychest,fcok5y3,t1_fco7wx1,1577834273.0,"We do! It's maybe once a week and he needs to do injections for ED. The meds can be meh where the erection will be there a while, then not, then come back. His genitals are below his injury so sensation is dampened for him, he honestly needs to essentially meditate to get to orgasm it won't happen from physical stimuli alone. 


He has the most heavenly mouth and oral sex is my fave. It's difficult for me to orgasm (always had been) so the fact he can help me get there and is a champion cuddler melts me every time. I miss that he can't do some simple ""normal"" things with me like walk down the street holding my hand, but he is precious to me and lights up my day. We are hoping to try making baby in the spring!"

relationship_advice,fcmgj6e,t3_eht4ex,1577774412.0,"So a lot of people gave you good advice regarding her needing to recognize she is unwell and needs help. Since that's her issue, what I would say for your future interactions when she brings up your weight or says you are anorexic is to tell her ""It really hurts my feelings when you bring this up, can we please not talk about my body."" And any number of other I statements where you lay out how her words make you feel. Even if she says it's concern, she should respect what you say and feel and you might need to set up consequences for if she continues to talk to you like this."

AmItheAsshole,fcl1l1u,t3_ehmsme,1577737821.0,"NTA but he is definitely the age where it is appropriate to address now. My half sister was my guardian growing up, she was close to my mom's age. I knew she wasn't my mom but also I didn't know anything about my parents until I was 13. I'm in my 30s now and it still hurts me not knowing who I came from, they are rarely talked about even though at least my mom wasn't a terrible person.

I only get off from oral sex or a vibrator. Now I don't put up with that shit because my current guy is awesome but seriously, trust your lady to know what will get her off while you're getting yourself off it can still be fun and exciting! Basically, toys of any kind don't make sex less-than in some way."

AskReddit,fcj0vlx,t3_eh8gs2,1577674504.0,I think the dissociation that can occur from it can be helpful in some ways (getting you through a tough time) but if you always use it for a tough time instead of trying to do some self reflection and inner work you are depriving yourself of other tools to help you deal with life. I try to be mindful of why I am partaking.
mdmatherapy,fcigz8k,t3_eh7a1r,1577662386.0,"1. I took mdma with the intention of partying with my now-partner but it ended up being 2 sessions one month apart in which I unloaded a lot of childhood trauma and he was there to listen or not listen to what I talked about mostly to myself. 
 

2. I felt elevated mood at first but then got really introspective. The first time was near Thanksgiving and the other around Christmas (both 2 years ago). I had made up my mind to never return to my childhood home due to sexual trauma from my guardian's husband. Visiting that house was too painful to even think about. I went into at least a 6 hour trip both times musing about how much it damaged my family's already messed up bonds and how difficult it was for me to feel vulnerable and open in adult relationships. I felt incredibly self conscious that I couldn't stop talking about what hurt me. But my guy was kind and just hugged me or sometimes asked questions. He even told me during the first time about it being used in therapy to help people with PTSD in a safe space.
 

3. It felt very cathartic, I discovered things about myself I had never felt willing to face and especially never say aloud. It also made me think of my guy more positively, I was so scared of being judged for feeling sad and broken over something that happened 20 years ago. I would say I'm feeling much more kind to and forgiving of myself, that I'm allowed to feel and process things in the timeframe that makes sense for me.


4. Any substance I take whether it's mdma, cannabis, or LSD I set my intention to learn from it. The first time I took mdma I didn't set an intention and those feelings arose from seemingly nowhere, I really didn't know how to handle myself. When it happened the second time I felt more prepared and I guess relaxed into the experience though I did end up chewing on my lips without paying attention (it was terrible lol, I always have gum or my mouthguard now)."
TooAfraidToAsk,fchsund,t3_eh74ie,1577653722.0,"Yeah, it's shitty and racist. I'm part Asian but my parents died and I have no connection to my mom's culture. When people ask me where I'm from I'll say Florida. When they ask where I was born I tell them Alabama. And when they ask about my parents I tell them they died when I was 2. 

It isn't a question that is asking what you have in common/to connect, it's a thoughtless question people ask to draw attention to how they perceive you to be different."
