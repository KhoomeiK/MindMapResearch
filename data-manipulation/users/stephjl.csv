aww,fdyzgl6,t1_fdyxvte,1578785157.0,"I chose the sphynx, I had always wanted one due to their dog-like personality. She is a lot of maintenance though, she needs weekly/bi-weekly baths due to their skin oils. Everything she touches gets her oil in it. She also needs her ears cleaned twice weekly (I never have to clean my hairy cats ears). 

Matilda the Jack sheds like crazy, she is my fiance's dog. I can't imagine she would be hypoallergenic."
