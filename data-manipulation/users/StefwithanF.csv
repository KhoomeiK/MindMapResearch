loseit,faxzal5,t3_eanm9s,1576392379.0,"Most schools will block what your kid eats,  as far as junk foods go. Call the school, say they can't drink sugar milk or eat chips or pizza or whatever. 

I guess you see that eating properly is important, but honestly, schools will follow your food directions if the kids eat there. 

Hopefully you can manage to be an example for your kids. It's more fun if y'all eat veggies & salad together before eating a reasonable portion of lasagna. Good luck!"
