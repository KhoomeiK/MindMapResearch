I've had rats for over 20 years, dozens and dozens of them. Some rats avoid stressful situations, some (usually the more dominant/territorial)rats confront them, to defend themselves and their space. This ratty is clearly not happy about the situation and certainly not acting like a ""mother"" grooming a baby, as the title suggests.

The cat isn't happy either, and it's not worth the risk when one rat bite could remove a toe, and one cat scratch could cause a deadly infection for a rodent."

To expand on your point about how tails are a potential health hazard for herding breeds, I figure it's worth a mention that we have herding breeds like stumpy-tailed cattle dogs.

This might be it. There have definitely been incredibly rare cases where vaccines have caused deaths, I'm reading up on an old paper(from the pre-MMR panic days) that mentions some of those cases, including anaphylaxis, here:   [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236284/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236284/)  


I also assume that problems discovered in the past would have been closely researched with changes implemented to prevent them from happening again, like discoveries of contaminated vaccine strains leading to improved production and quality testing methods. Today we also have better diagnostics for immune disorders so we can avoid vaccinating those at-risk groups altogether(especially live-attenuated vaccines like MMR). It was only 20 years ago that they stopped using the oral polio vaccine because, while that live version was effective, it caused a few cases of polio a year, out of millions of doses.  


All of that sort of adds to the example. Even in the past, vaccine related injury/death was a rarity, and progress is always being made to make modern vaccines safer than ever. I'd still rather take those oldschool vaccines over all the far-more-than-potentially deadly diseases they'd prevent."
vaxxhappened,fcj6fo7,t1_fciawhm,1577678427.0,"Like with any medicine, there's always a risk that something will go wrong. [There have been deaths](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/)directly associated with vaccines, but these deaths are caused by instantaneous reactions, like severe anaphylaxis, or complications with live-vaccines and undiagnosed autoimmune disorders; not random unrelated deaths 6 weeks after a booster shot...

That said, death from vaccine-triggered anaphylaxis is so, so incredibly rare; there's a 1 in a million chance per dose of triggering potentially fatal anaphylaxis - swift treatment avoids death. There are very few medicines that have such positive odds for safety. For example, common antibiotics like penicillin come with about a 1 in 30,000 chance of potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction, so I recognise vaccines as being among the very safest treatments.

My real point here is that it's not helpful to deny the potential dangers of vaccines, but there is an opportunity to really demonstrate the safety of vaccines - by putting their relatively tiny chance of injury into true perspective.  


(Edited because I previously said there was a 1 in a million chance of fatal anaphylaxis per vaccine dose, instead of potentially\* fatal. Those are not the chances of actual death as vaccines are given in a medical environment equipped to deal with such a reaction.)"

awfuleverything,fc4jwjo,t1_fc4f4f2,1577418818.0,"Well shit, I hope you went with a labrador breeder who bothers with genetic testing and joint scoring. My aunt had to pay 3 grand to get surgery for her black lab's elbows and hips. We kinda expected hip dysplasia in labs, at this point it's so hard to avoid with the breed, but elbow dysplasia is the next level. Shitty breeders are always going to exist. It's up to owners to reject the unhealthy, over-exaggerated animals and try to only buy healthy animals from breeders who give a fuck.

And, not to be rude, but it almost sounds like you had an English Bulldog. Olde Englishes are not supposed to have severe underbites as reverse scissor bite is the standard, and excessive wrinkles are a fault. English/British bulldogs seems to have both those features as standard. So I'm sorry you had to deal with a shitty example of the breed, and I'm sorry the dog had to exist with those problems."

The initial mutation was random, but environmental factors like malaria, a mosquito-borne disease that is more common in those regions than anywhere else, helped the mutation propagate further. Sickle cell offers some resistance to Malaria so, on average, humans with the disease have a greater chance of living long enough to reproduce than they would without that mutation, as facing the full blown effects of malaria is often fatal."

Like retromops are a recreation of old pugs(they used outcrossing to achieve this in both projects). Just an example of how dog breeding can work well, when people aren't creating horrible cruel monstrosities like the dog in the OP.

Here's more info:  
*In the early 1970s, dog breeder David Leavitt of Coatesville, PA. wanted to ""recreate a Bulldog with the looks, health and athleticism of the 18th Century Bulldog which was originally created for the English sport of bull baiting between the years 1100 to 1835"".\[3\] In an effort to rapidly achieve his goal for a purebred dog, Leavitt modeled his program after a livestock line breeding scheme developed by Nathan Fechimer, a professor in the Department of Dairy Science, Ohio State University.\[1\] The foundation breeding for what became the modern Olde English Bulldogge consisted of half English Bulldog, one-sixth Bullmastiff, one-sixth American Pit Bull Terrier and one sixth American Bulldog. The result was an athletic breed that looks similar to the bulldogs of 1820, but with a friendly temperament, fewer health issues, and with longevity reaching into the teens. US researchers have said the Olde English Bulldogge is a ""viable candidate"" as an outcross on which to rebuild the English Bulldog; a breed that genetic studies have suggested is so inbred that it ""cannot be returned to health without an infusion of new bloodlines.""\[4\]*"
aww,fc1esm5,t1_fc1agvm,1577316609.0,"I reckon pits are the dog of choice for fuckheads who own them for shitty purposes because they are the easiest dogs to handle(physically and temperament-wise), when compared to other powerful breeds capable of inflicting heavy damage in an attack, like rottweilers, rhodesians, mastiffs, etc. Given the choice, I would rather deal with an aggressive pit over a rottie."

Projects like these further prove that creating tormented vaguely dog-shaped entities, like the one in the OP, is completely cruel and unnecessary."
