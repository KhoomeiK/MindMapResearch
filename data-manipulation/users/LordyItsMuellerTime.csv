I have a hard time asking my MIL for help. I feel like I have to put on airs and have my shit together and the house clean before she comes over. 

Just try to respect your wife's wishes and help her any way you can. Yes, she may seem like she's overreacting or irrational but this is the biggest life change, hormone swing, and probably physically damaging thing she's ever been through. It's hard as fuck right now but it gets better. And get her to the doctor if you suspect she has PPD."

Because she is a cruel narcissist, and those traits don't really develop overnight. Maybe do some soul searching and try to remember other times she's shown these traits.
