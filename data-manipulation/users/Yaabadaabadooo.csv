She visited the girl's washroom but on opening the door there was already somebody sitting in there and looking at her with innocent eyes. 

My sister then tries to close the door out of courtesy and shock but the handle comes off, then the girl inside tries close it but her arms and legs are way too short for that. The tussle between my sister and the girl on toilet went on for few seconds before the girl was able to close the door. 

Moral of the story - double check the latch on the door.

Another story - my mother got stuck in the cubicle because she couldn't open the latch.
