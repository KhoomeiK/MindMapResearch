singapore,fglguug,t1_fglbxdd,1580897082.0,This is especially true at the airport. I’ve seen countless of times Grab drivers getting chased away cos there is no waiting at the pick up points.
ShingekiNoKyojin,fglgpvj,t3_ez6uxk,1580896882.0,And I’m glad you did
thalassophobia,fglgmwy,t3_ez49zn,1580896759.0,Good god my heart just skipped a beat
ShingekiNoKyojin,fgldcen,t1_fglc5fw,1580891952.0,What about the Interior Police lady that Armin shot in the cart during Uprising Arc ? Or do you mean just prominent named characters ?
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fglbpz6,t3_eywcja,1580889748.0,Anyone else finds this oddly satisfying ?
anime,fgl77ib,t3_ez3fuu,1580884404.0,"Recently finished this. What an absolutely gorgeous show. The scenery is just so beautifully done. And the story and characters are so captivating. Honestly couldn’t say much except I thoroughly enjoyed it and it leaves an impression.

Also, watching this on a quiet weekday afternoon was really soothing (if you don’t include the emotionally heavy moments)

Still, I can never not hear Mikasa the whole time lol"
ShingekiNoKyojin,fgl6i1j,t1_fgl3g01,1580883682.0,I honestly don’t know how some people are so sure that it’s going that route and bumming themselves out. I mean it’s Isayama we’re talking about
ShingekiNoKyojin,fgl6d13,t1_fgl4iz3,1580883543.0,I think Isayama did say he wants to hurt the readers
anime,fgl65sb,t3_eywiy8,1580883340.0,"Honestly didn’t realize we were so far into the season already. 17 ?? I thought we were still at episode 5.

This season kinda reminds me of Haikyuu S3 where the main focus is on one match or event. I’m definitely into this. The intense, suspense and mind games of Karuta. Not to mention the constant flip flopping of who is getting the upper hand. But I’m also looking forward to when things calm down in, what I think would be, Season 4 (hopefully we’re getting another season).

I want to see all the Karuta Club shenanigans again. All the school stuff. And also excited to see what the future holds. Pretty sure Chihaya is looking forward to next year"
ShingekiNoKyojin,fgkm14j,t1_fgjm9ck,1580868670.0,"Yea true. I’m seeing so many giving up on him even after all this time. Even if the setup seems so predictably cliche, I personally feel he has earned the benefit of the doubt. Heck with the story so far, I’m expecting some sort of twist amongst this seemingly Avengers-style ending."
ManchesterUnited,fgkfb1y,t3_eywhbw,1580864217.0,Not expecting him to do anything big but still a good player to bolster our numbers and hopefully also provide a different style of attack
ShingekiNoKyojin,fgjdzlk,t1_fgjd37p,1580842054.0,I think the bigger question is how will they kill him  (if they even can) ?
ShingekiNoKyojin,fgjdwcu,t1_fgjdg9e,1580842001.0,"You should know Armin, of all people, is one who can put his emotions aside for rationality. Totally in character"
ShingekiNoKyojin,fgjdlpv,t3_eys4cx,1580841823.0,"This chapter felt a bit rushed but considering Hitch and Annie came from Stohess I think this chapter takes place in the span of a few days. Still felt kinda weird not seeing more confusion/uncertainty from seeing Annie again. Seemed like she just seamlessly joined in the group like nothing happened. But from my experience with this manga so far, we might see an interaction of that in later chapters.

This also goes out to the other storylines in the chapter. Just felt like interactions are cut down to resolve that particular story.

I’m also not really someone who criticize, but at the end, I ended up asking myself, what was the point of the Connie-Armin situation ? What did we get from that ? But after thinking about it, I think it’s just to resolve Connie and his mom. And maybe also Armin’s self-doubt. Isayama might be starting to tie up the little loose ends in his story.

It’s also crazy how fanatical some of the people of Paradis have become, thanks to the influence of the Yeagerists. Can definitely see a civil war breaking out in Paradis. Still, with the powers that he has, Eren is way too powerful. I really wonder  what they can do against him.

Finally, I’ve said this before about Isayama. His stories seem to be predictable. But HOW it unfolds will take you by surprise. I still have faith that as cliche as it currently seems to be heading, I’m not surprised if there is a twist as to how we actually get there."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fgj6ozn,t1_fgivxxx,1580838010.0,I love how there’s like 7 people there and they all agreed to let Annie kick him in the face instead of waking him up normally.
ShingekiNoKyojin,fgisyrf,t3_eymhng,1580830227.0,Why do so many seem so sure about the ending that they’re already disappointed and giving up on the series ?
ShingekiNoKyojin,fgishpm,t1_fgig5ho,1580829928.0,The moment you realized Floch was right. Lol jkjk not saying he was totally right but he did have a valid point during serumbowl and the ceremony afterwards but received a lot of flak for it

reddevils,fghxbmf,t3_eyjbyo,1580796806.0,Just what on earth are they doing in training for corners ? We are horrendous at both attacking and defending corners.
singapore,fghx6jl,t3_eyhu3b,1580796668.0,Lol imagine if they don’t want to deny it and have to bregudgingly donate that amount

mildlyinteresting,fghwmjx,t1_fghcu26,1580796137.0,"Everytime I see images like these, especially if it’s on wood or bones, I get this urge to break and grind and crush it to little pieces. I want to see it’s brittle structure crumble.

Still a very beautiful piece though"

reddevils,fg83jif,t1_fg81530,1580608577.0,I cannot understand the thinking behind allowing Mata and Pereira to mark Traore while Maguire is standing there marking a zone with no opponents. Honestly wonder what they do in training for corners
