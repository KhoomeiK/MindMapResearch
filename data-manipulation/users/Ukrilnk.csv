NarcissisticAbuse,ffw63dv,t1_fft67dr,1580286051.0,"Yes I push people away and the thing with lovebombing it’s a narcs tactic but also someone who genuinely likes you and is crazy for you might show it at the beginning, my friends boyfriend spoiled her with gifts and love in the beginning and 2 years in he’s still the same and they’re very happy and healthy. I’m scared I’ll mistake someone’s genuine love for a narc tactic"
NarcissisticAbuse,ffstkll,t3_euxy18,1580191958.0,If not empaths they’re around artificial people. My narc has friend who weren’t empathetic but all they cared about is keeping their “day 1” circle still intact and they all feed off eachother and used eachother. What’s worse is the empaths in my ex’s life attacked me verbally which really hurt because I know they’re good people who were manipulated by him and the fake people in his life attacked too which annoyed me because y’all are losers and he don’t even like you
depression,ffstf0u,t3_ev0dxa,1580191794.0,I have trouble sleeping because of my insomnia but I love my bed and being in it is the best thing in the world but hey atleast I’m not spending dollars at the club or expensive outings
depression,ffstd8s,t3_ev0v0h,1580191744.0,Yes it didn’t and it makes me feel like a failure because I seen a thread about girls and guys who suffered from depression getting calm at the gym and they have amazing figures. I really want to be healthy physically and look good too especially during vacation or the summer. It sucks and makes me feel more worthless because the fact that depressed people kick butt at the gym but I can’t and I often slack and just quit. :(
depression,ffst7su,t3_ev079c,1580191587.0,"Omg this happened to me more than once. I feel like I’m never gonna be someone’s real love and it hurts a lot. I often get depressed because Ik people loved their ex’s harder even if they tell me I’m better or not. 
Just know you’re not alone :) and if you’re a good person good will come and you don’t deserve to be heartbroken so either she’ll see that you’re so much more or you’ll find better. Just have faith !"
