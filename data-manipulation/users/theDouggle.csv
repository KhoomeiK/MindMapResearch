PublicFreakout,fg9q1u9,t1_fg31pim,1580641823.0,"Tukwila police released body camera video Thursday showing how a civilian interfered with an investigation and made the situation more dangerous for officers.
On Jan. 28, officers responded to reports of a man threatening people with a knife along Tukwila International Blvd. 
With body cameras rolling, officers repeatedly told the man to get on the ground, but he did not comply. Officers continued to keep their distance and issued clear directives to the man, all while holding their tasers and guns. 

But as they were working to de-escalate the situation, a passing driver stopped his car in the middle of the road, got out and started recording the scene with his smartphone, police said. 
The driver ignored officers' commands to stay back and instead walked right up to the suspect, which can be seen in the body camera footage.
Officers pulled that man to the ground for his own safety, police said. But he then began kicking the officer and hitting the officer with his cell phone, which was also caught on video. 
Police ended up arresting both of the men. 
The so-called 'Good Samaritan' is facing charges for obstructing a public servant and assaulting an officer. The man with the knife is also facing charges for brandishing a weapon and obstructing a public servant, police said. 
You can watch the full video on the Tukwila Police Department's Facebook page."

Mine is from 2012, AX850, and has outlasted every single other PSU I've purchased for friends.  The 80+ Gold cert means it's fantastic with power regulation and only uses what it needs \[and some other stuff, I forget exactly what each tier means\] and you know it's been well taken care of.  I would just give it a good cleaning, do research on your particular model to find out what experiences people have if/when they do fail. Like, were components shorted out because of a surge from failure, or did it just shut down - I've had a MOBO be fried from an old thermaltake ""gamer"" 450watt from like 2004, blew in 2009 and killed my stock HP mobo that sported an enormous \[at the time\] HD 4850.

It was a really unique way of giving the player control that I really dug. They also had a really cool memory ""remixing"" function on certain levels that had a ton of potential and was pretty fun as it was implemented.

The original E3 footage showed more of an assassin's creed type open world in futuristic neo Paris, but they went with a more linear structure because of time and budget constraints.

I enhanced that by setting my crg9 to 5120x1440 but then down scaling the resolution to I think 3/4, with AA, and it runs even better. One unfortunate thing was that setting the resolution to 3840x1080, still the 32:9 aspect ratio, the engine would just CROP the 5120x1440 render to achieve the lesser resolution, effectively lowering the FOV significantly. I got even better frames at that resolution, but the crop was too much so I went with the downscale on the higher resolution to maintain the wider fov. And after doing the math, the downscale still is greater resolution than 3840x1080p, so I'm really pleased with the respective sweet spot I've managed for my particular preferences and machine."
