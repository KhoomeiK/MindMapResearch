If they're only slightly heavier than you, you can just go closer to the wall and put your foot on it and lean back so that you are more stable. As a pretty small teen (14ish, F), I belayed average sized adult men who were climbing, and I didn't use an anchor and it wasn't a problem. The more comfortable with belaying you are, the easier it gets.

Communication is key - if the climber is going too fast, you need to shout up and tell them to slow down. They should have noticed the rope was slack and slowed down, though.

If you're still unsure about belaying, use a grigri! In my experience, people are more comfortable with them as they know they have the automatic locking system to keep the climber safe"
AskReddit,fda61ub,t1_fda0b5v,1578242190.0,"Cook them differently. Roast, fry, steam, whatever you can think of. One of my favourites is fried cabbage with butter. Granted, it's not as healthy, but definitely better than no veggies at all! My favourite vegetable is brussel sprouts - even though I can taste slight bitterness, I like it. Don't categorise when it comes to trying food. Carrots cooked like *this* can be very different to carrots cooked like *that*. If you haven't had a veggie cooked in one way before, cook it like that and try it, even if you don't like the veggie. You can also try it raw, sometimes that's better (but do a quick Google to make sure it's safe)

Edit: if you like sweet things, try roasting with honey. Carrots and parsnips are great like that.
