languagelearning,fdckbn7,t1_fdce059,1578277032.0,"In fact, you're not learning anything, or if you're learning, you just end up memorizing very few words. 

Intercomprehension works on reading and listening level because you can rely on your native language or the language you already know to recognize simple lexical items (words and non complex sentences). But you cant reproduce them after or recognize the same words in a more complex oral text most of the time for example. 
Sorry but they used to work a lot on this field in the 90s and now it is a phenomenon that's given for granted somehow. I've always found it boring but I see that it is always an hot topic of discussion among language learners.

And you're right to some extent when you say that it is easy for romance language speakers to pick up another romance language. It is true until   you get to a B1/B2 level, an Italian could really learn to speak and understand a pretty much good deal of French in no more than three months, but after that starting point we may encounter other issues. when the syntax of your native language and vocabulary cognates could become more of an obstacle than helping you in reaching a certain ""finesse""."
