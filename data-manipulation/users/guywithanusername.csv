I'm not a true vegan or smth but they have a point. Especially cow meat, it's not good for the environment. They fart out methane, which is one of greenhouse gasses. They consume a lot of food (the production of that is partly the cause of the Amazon fires), and need a lot of water. 


They also need relatively much space, which can't be used to plant trees or other larger plants. The transport of the meat is (obviously) also quite polluting, while organic food can be grown on a smaller scale and so it is normally closer. 


Also (especially in America) people eat too much meat, and that causes health problems. They then need medicines and maybe a medical operation, which is also not good for anyone. For other illnesses this is perfectly fine, but in this particular case it's easily preventable and thus a waste of resources (money, medicines, time of doctors that could be spend on other patients, etc).


In my opinion it's never good to judge people, but it goes both ways. They have to respect people who eat meat, and people who eat meat have to respect people who don't (whatever their reasons are). The only thing I'm saying is that they have a point."
