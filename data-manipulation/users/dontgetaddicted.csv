DonutMedia,ffzslej,t1_ffy4jqk,1580391702.0,They posted not too long ago that they are going back and doing more Hi/Low to the same cars. James said they left a lot of power on the table - specifically with the injectors. Not sure what else they will be doing but it should be interesting.
Garmin,ffzrtsy,t1_ffzoyfm,1580391061.0,"There is a setting to adjust your stride length. Well, you tell it a known distance, and how many strides you take to cover that distance then it calculates your stride length. Then they take steps x stride to give you distance. I think this method would be pretty far off in something like soccer or basketball because you take so many adjustment steps/pivots/crossovers that aren't real full length strides.

And the pair I wear daily doesn't look any different from a nice pair of dress shoes because my pants cover the upper portion anyway. Styles can be wild to tame to functional. But style aside, they're super comfortable and seriously last forever and can be resoled or repaired if you happen to hurt them some how. 

But ya, not for everyone, that's why I suggested trying on a pair and not buying a pair. $300 is a commitment for sure. Arriat especially has this ATS insole that's just freaking amazing. Just walking around the store for a lap sold me on them."

The days after your surgery - don't even try to get out of bed. Just lay there and chill, catch up on Netflix.

About 3 days after surgery getting up - while difficult - becomes less of a chore.

A week or 2 after surgery - don't even think about being physical or active. Short walks to the fridge for snacks and back to the bed or couch. Maybe up to your desk to feel productive.

3 weeks after, you can move around and get out and do things, but physical exertion is going to be painful and potentially dangerous.

A month+ start working on moving and being limber. You've been lazy for a while, things are tight. Stretch and and wiggle and get the blood moving.

2 months+ start a slow workout again. Don't try to jump right into where you were. Especially crossfit, the level of movement involved is potentially going to be a problem at first until your honestly probably 3+ months out.

Stay hydrated the entire time, even if you aren't thirsty - keep the kidney wet. This got me landed back in the hospital for dehydration.

Oh - also, if you're proud of your abs, take a before picture. Shit gets wrecked and will never look good again haha. Pretty sure my surgeon took a weedeater to my abdominal wall.

Edit: Oh - yeah, I should say everyone is different, everyone's surgery and experience is different. But I'd honestly plan for a solid 2+ month break from physical exertion."

I returned the hardware to the store on day 28. Have a receipt still to this day that shows I returned the hardware. Well, VZW bills me for total cost of hardware and a month of service. I can agree with paying for a month of service...kind of, but that's not a ""free"" test drive is it? But I returned the hardware...I ain't paying for that.
