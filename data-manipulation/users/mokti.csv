The former are great and I love them to pieces. Always there for each other and me. Best friends a person could ask for. Miss them terribly as I moved across the country last year.

The latter both took a lot of advantage of me in the name of friendship... and when I needed either of them, they were nowhere to be found. Also, they were with other people and cheated together while leaning on me emotionally, putting a lot of strain and stress on me."

The simple fact of the matter is that STDs happen... partially BECAUSE it's so taboo for some to talk about. I think the statistic is 1 in 6 folks has herpes and many may not even know it because they are asymptomatic. I've known Doctors who simply ""forget"" to test for it when they do panels unless specifically asked to because it's so ubiquitous and relatively harmless."

sex,ffou1ow,t3_eu6fta,1580081834.0,"You revoked consent with your safe word. She should have stopped. 

Let that sink in.

You really need to at the very least have a dead serious talk with her, perhaps escalating to something more legal system-y... because she did assault you by continuing after you revoked consent, only stopping when she realized you were serious by your tears. 

You might be able to lay it at the feet of youthful inexperience with safe words, but then fact that she recognized your desire to stop and told you she wanted to keep going is very dangerous if you let her off."

MakeMeSuffer,ffj92ov,t1_ffj7u77,1579993330.0,"Yes, but was there enough power imbalance here? We judge based on cultural norms, but what are the practical truths here?

They did not know each other until they were adults. They are guilty of incest, but does him being her biodad automatically negate any consent?

They were strangers on the end of connected genetic chains. Its taboo as fuck and, to judge by nsfw subs and pornhub search stats, really popular to fantasize about... such so that she takes time out of her article to discuss both daddy/daughter and mother/son incest in popular culture.

God, it's just so fucked up."
MakeMeSuffer,ffj87i1,t1_ffj7icn,1579992789.0,"I'm pretty sure that I agree she was confused... and, yes, I would be, too... but does that negate her consent? 

While I understand what you went through caused conflicting acts in your situation, I'm trying to read HER situation. And after reading both articles, while it makes me sick to my stomach, I cannot find assault. She puts the responsibility of consent for both of them on him... and initiated depending on how she felt at various times. They both initiated despite discussing how wrong they felt it was. It was icky, weird assed adult incest. But without more facts it isnt assault.

I very much understand how she could be traumatized by these events... but that doesnt mean she can abdicate her role in them."
MakeMeSuffer,ffj79nz,t1_ffj49z4,1579992162.0,"Its seductive behavior... but is it grooming? 

We attach grooming to adult/children relationships possibly because when the same behavior happens between adults, we dont have a problem with it because we assume the adults have the wherewithal and power balance to tell unwanted advances to fuck off. When they dont, it's called harrassment and can lead to sexuall assault and rape. 

I think he was seducing her... but I draw the line at grooming. The issue here is was there substantive power imbalance between them. And can you revoke consent when you're the one initiating?"
MakeMeSuffer,ffj5032,t1_ffj3zq8,1579990549.0,But what about what she wanted... which varied depending on the mood of the moment?
MakeMeSuffer,ffj4hhz,t1_ffj1u3h,1579990169.0,"> In fact, she is the reason it all started in the first place.


I dunno. From the read of the Jezebel article, he sounds like he was definitely acting like she was a viable sex partner from the start. Or at least fantasizing about it.

Also, he does seem to be taking advantage. Cultural norms say parents most certainly shouldnt do what they did. She says she had a compulsion to fuck... he took advantage to get sexual acts against cultural norms. Icky as fuck, but was it assault? The power dynamic of parent/child even if they are weak at best, only occurring during adulthood... she was alone in a strange country and relying on his hospitality... do those facts negate consent?"
MakeMeSuffer,ffj43mg,t1_ffj1ai3,1579989885.0,"I'm gonna need you to quote, cause I really am missing the no... I'm seeing the ""I told him I couldnt stop and he would have to stop for both of us"" but not the no. I'm also seeing where they both initiated oral sex at different times and she puts the responsibility on him for both.

 I'm also seeing the times HE said no, which was when she wanted unprotected penetrative sex and said no cause he was her father.

This really is the perfect sub for this. Ugh. Why was I surfing Popular in Target? Oh yeah, so I wouldnt see nsfw links... instead I got NSFSoul."
MakeMeSuffer,ffj3hi5,t1_ffj1mzn,1579989442.0,"It said she initiated, too."
MakeMeSuffer,ffiuwvj,t1_ffiud3k,1579983330.0,"No, the article doesnt say she ever said ""no"" or that she fought his advances, just that she ceded responsibility to him (which isnt a thing) and he kept initiating. She said she felt powerless to stop... but never said no. At least, not that I saw in the article.

How does active consent even work in a situation where someone feels powerless to stop their own attraction to someone? If you feel an internal compulsion to fuck someone such that you tell them ""I have no power to resist fucking you"" is that still your choice?"
DnDGreentext,ffiue6o,t3_etotf9,1579982968.0,Maybe this is because adults feel out of control of their lives despite having enormous responsibilities and need a safe outlet to vent their frustrations that dont involve harming real people?
MakeMeSuffer,ffiu57k,t1_ffiti13,1579982787.0,"Was she saying no, though? No does mean no... but that doesnt read as what she said. It read like she had an overwhelming sexual attraction that he willingly took advantage of, but she had the ability to deny the advances... just not the willpower.

And the back and forth between wanting it so badly at night and being disgusted and suicidal during the day. This is beyond fucked up.

Therapy for years... but i still cant parse assault. Scummy as fuck. But not assault. Ugh. Somebody make me wrong! Uggggghhh"
MakeMeSuffer,ffit9ey,t1_ffilhuf,1579982155.0,"I mean, is it? 

I dont know if this would count. Making horrible life choices doesnt negate consent... and telling someone they have to stop you from making bad choices doesnt mean they literally have to stop you or its assault. You are responsible for your own choices when not impaired by drugs... but this is a case of impaired by theories of psychology?

The power dynamic of him being her biodad makes things really so goddamned messed up... but they never knew each other until adulthood. She wanted to reconnect with a parental figure... but he wasnt really one, was he? Just a sperm donor? So incest, yes, but sexual assault? She had the power to say no but he initiated, so does that negate her consent? Could she even consent in the first place?

Focus on foreplay... lots of it... and try and help your partner to orgasm before penetration (oral, fingering, whatever) because the first time you feel the main event, you aren't going to last long. It's cliche, but it's true.As a species, we wait our whole adolescent (and for some folks adult) lives building up the idea of penetrative sex. There's a reason for that. 


If you're a gal?

Tell your partner what feels good to you and what doesn't. And listen to them for the same. Don't be passive. This first time is going to take a lot of getting used to when you actually do accept someone (or something being held by someone) inside of you. Make sure they go at the pace YOU feel comfortable with. If you're not getting (or can't get) wet enough, stop and get some lube. You'll thank yourself later. 

Also, if you're with a guy and he comes fast, don't laugh. Take it as a compliment... that your pussy game was just too good. Odds are he doesn't mean to.
