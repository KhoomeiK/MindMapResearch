Some tips:

- Suck on ice chips. they help numb your tummy.
- Ice water a spoonful at a time. Wait several minutes between spoonfuls.
- Have some peppermint and/or ginger tea. One spoonful at a time.
- Anything ginger will help: teabags, tea made from boiling fresh, ginger capsules, candied ginger, ginger ale. For ginger ale you can try it fizzy or let it sit out for a while and get flat. 
- I find Mylanta helps settle my stomach. I'll take a double dose. Some people keep it in the fridge because the cold helps.
- Zofran generic ondansetron is very effective. you can dissolve the pill in your mouth.

For pain:

- Children's Motrin or tylenol. It's liquid. Be careful of the dosing instructions. 
- Ice packs or warm packs on the painful part, like if you have a headache.
- Epsom salts bath for muscle aches.
- Heating pad."

When I had an infected tooth recently my dentist said he preferred prescribing keflex for me since it was safer and I agreed.

For bladder infections it's important to culture the urine. A lot of my UtIs turned out to be kidney stones, which is why the antibiotic didn't work. Macrodatin (nitrofurantoin) is the drug of choice for UtIs. Unfortunately I am allergic so Cipro is the next logical choice for me.

Hit me soooo hard, and I usually get a flu shot but in October. I actually had to go to the ER at one point for fluids. I also lost 15 pounds. Could barely stand up, completely lost my sense of smell. Couldn't eat. 

Given that you have no energy there's not much you can do. Nor should you do much. I got post viral fatigue and the only treatment for that is rest, rest, rest, rest and lots of fluids. So don't do much.

I would have plenty of bottled water and cups in the bedroom. Might want to get disposable cups. Cut back on the waste by re-using one all day. Have some water every 2 hours. Have other liquids on had too, like Gatorade or Pedialyte. I was lucky when I got sick that I had several gallons of water upstairs next to the bedroom (because our town gets water main breaks all the time), so I was able to stay hydrated. 

Snacks are good to have. I don't like to keep food in the bedroom but having salty snacks like potato chips was helpful. Also a big bag of sugarless cough drops. 

At least one box of tissues and a garbage can/bag to toss them in. 

A vaporizer would be a big plus. If you want to make the place smell nice I would recommend a couple of drops of lavender oil on a tissue or cotton ball near the bed, provided it is tolerated. Another option would be eucalyptus oil. If he has pneumonia that may be too much for him. If you can, air it out for a few minutes every day.

A pile of pillow to prop himself up on to read or rest more comfortably.

I ate a lot of flavored yogurt and protein shakes and soy milk. Getting solids down was really hard. Other things are fruit juice (although realize it's solid sugar), apple sauce, broth, bone broth, Jell-o, pudding. I realize this is not exactly a healthy diet but you need to get some calories and lots of fluid and electrolytes. 

Baby wipes. I couldn't get in the shower or bath, just too dizzy and weak. And least I could wipe down the stinky parts. Not that I could smell anything for the first week.

If you have energy then straightening out the bed or making it everyday. Must easier to rest if you are not fighting the bedclothes. Maybe switch out the pillowcases. Doing the sheets is high energy. I had to get my neighbor to change my stinky sheets for me.

A stack of quiet things to do, like books, magazines, puzzle books, a radio or MP3 player, a laptop or an iPad. I have a 7 year old iPad and I was burning thru the battery every day listening to music so I finally bought a new one. Now one charges while the other plays. And the new one is like 10 times faster and all my apps work again.

Oh, and lots of peace and quiet. I live alone so it was me and the cat. And it's a very quiet rural neighborhood. So ear plugs and an eye shade. A hat like a beanie will help him stay warm."
