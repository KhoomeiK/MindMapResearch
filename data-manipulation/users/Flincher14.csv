The Governor general's role has to be filled by some institution. The office is fairly cheap in its current form. Radically changing it could be expensive. 

I think the fact that the prime minister technically isnt the head of the country and serves at the pleasure of someone else is humbling and reduces the ability of Trump style leaders to seize the country by populism.

Pathfinder_Kingmaker,fgt3v9n,t1_fgt2sqp,1581098493.0,"Respecing and mercenaries are new.

Clerics are the healer/utility class. They basically come with every spell but are not naturally buffed to any particular school of magic.

For example my cleric heals the whole party. He cast a +2 buff on all attacks. He can raise the attributes of every character +4. He has freedom of movement spell which prevents paralyzing.  He has undeath to dead which basically single handedly wins every fight in the game against undead.

HOWEVER. The mage companion you get can also buff everyone in basically all the same ways and just lacks the heals.

A paladin can heal and fight in melee pretty well but only has the bare minimum of utility spells.

The straight up support class can be cleric or bard or a mercenaru mage built specifically for it.

The game is very flexible and the spells are all shared by many classes so it just comes down to some classes having stronger skill checks on some spells or have more cast per day of spells and some like bard have unique abilities(party buffing auras)

TL:DR you must keep a cleric in your party and one spellcaster for buffs. The other 4 characters are your choice.

Edit: none of the buffs are improved by specific classes or feats. A cleric will have the same strength buff as an inquistor even though inquisitor are very weak magic casters."

Animal companions help a ton early game. Many classes get one. Its basically a free melee fighter. One of your companions gets one in act 2 as well. You mentioned a barb with animal companion. It will serve you well.

A huge part of the game is 'pre-buffing' before fights. There is almost no hard fights in game where you wont have a chance to buff your party before the fight. Every buff from raising attributes, adding tank, adding poison immunity etc is extremely important. Clerics and such are kings are this but you have 2 potential cleric companions so being one as your main is pointless."
