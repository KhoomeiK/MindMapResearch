If she wanted a better life she could have easily moved away to any EU country. Just to us their neighbour. And then work for it. Generally any women who marries an American on any other those dating website is not seen  in a nice light.

Also saying Eastern European as term is no indication at all. I am same age as her and didn't have life as her at all. Anyone under 30 and even more didn't have many hardship growing up, because commies have been gone for that long. And even during the commies some countries were not as poor as Usa seems to think.

AskEurope,ff5nji0,t3_erihwo,1579601851.0,"In Slovakia it's very complicated. But basically, yep we might be racist, because we are literally not used to it. 

Bear in mind we basically had zero African immigration and didn't have colonial history or so. So we are very homogeneous country. Immigration is a fairly new concept for us. Like 20 maybe 30 years concept. So yes close minded, who don't travel are racist. Especially after the refugee crisis. There was a huge anti Islam wave that also reached here (despite us having like zero refugees) and with all the fake news many people believed in the right wing propaganda. So black people are okay, especially if you are Christian, but Islam is no no. So it's more about religion. 

So at some point some time ago we had a guy famous just because he was African. But Africa not African American, he was from Cameroon. He became a famous singer here. There was a mixed boy in my small hometown and he was something as local celebrity for girls. 

However we had Vietnamese communities immigration during commies. So thats kinda seen. They are silent communities, you don't hear much about them. 

In Bratislava people are getting used to it, but if you are black and gonna visit the rest of the country especially rural places, you are going to be stared at. If you speak Slovak that will blow their minds. For many old people probably first one they ever seen. Will have to drink a lot too. But lot of people travels these days, so those who do it are okay, more open. 

Racism here is more targeted against Roma communities and we know its an issue. But can't really explain it unless you lived somewhere near a bigger Roma community. But wanna get votes in elections? Target romas. 

There is also rasism based on ethnicity in Europe. Like anti Eastern european in UK, anti irish, Scottish, or even anti English. Its pretty much not possible to use American racism in Europe as every country has different history, or different colonial history or lack of it.

There was also a really interesting topic about black soldiers in WW2, 1 in France in askhistorians threads, look for it. Basically something along the  American black soldiers were treated more equally than French colonial troops because they were considered more civilised.

AskEurope,fess3yk,t1_fesremw,1579368443.0,"But this was everywhere. Dan Diego, Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Seattle. 

Also on bus station in Merced at night. Yep lots of homeless with carts. Was scared.

I hope one day some politicians can deal with it. Because the thing is your homeless are different to ours. Some of them were just kinda normal just unfortunate people with debt that caugh up with them. Our homeless are really small in numbers, but usually crazy drunks that can really be helped anymore.

But true I haven't been to East Coast much. I would love to ve to visit Chicago I always wanted to visit here. Seems like a city for me. Or New Orleans for jazz."
AskEurope,fesq2rt,t3_eqgizg,1579367833.0,"Way too much stuff. I always have a huge culture shock in USA.

Driving everywhere and no public transport is my biggest problem. (West coast). No pedestrian zones. 

Huge waste culture in food.

The service people bothering you to death. 

People bagging your stuff in groceries. Plastic all around.

The political correctness. Or more like on purpose splitting people in white, brown, black. Calling me white privileged even if I neve ehad experience with USA culture. 

The dressing style. I am not a big fan of athletileasure (or something. ) Also generally I belive people dress more sexi there. Or people going out in sweats. 

The hoods. 

The streets full of homeless tents just a few meters walk from the rich downtown area in Las Vegas or Los Angeles. I was really shocked by the number of homeless people. 

Its either super fit people or really overweight people. I have seen some of the biggest people in my life. 

The absolutely crazy MLM people. I had amway experience. 

Mormons in Utah. Amish. 

Also this is more west coast, Nevada, Utah Arizona. East Coast may be different. 


This for California: I found people much more fake or retouched  in appearance. Much more focus on it. Like wearing shaping spandex to gym, wearing full make up (your poor skin) and I have never seen so many fake boobs and lips in one place. Gym in California is kinda an experience. 

What bothered me. I had people calling me I am from Russia. And I had some snide remarks about having a American bf for just a green card in Utah. Apparently because of some reality show. I don't even want to move to USA, but tis just better for now. 

What I really like: People were nice. Really talkative and interested about my country. Hikers and backpackers in USA are just the same as back home. 

I absolutely love your national parks.

I freaking love Tacos. And Tamales. Mexican taco trucks rule. Mexican food rules. 

I love San Diego. 

Frozen yogurt places. Love those. 

Lots of vegan restaurants in California, that's good. Yes sorry I prefer to eat more veggie options. 

People are really passionate about stuff. 

Also of you have money you really do live nice life there.

Edit: grammar problems."

AskEurope,feqkard,t1_feo8c0w,1579342854.0,Yeah. I mean they have waay to much. For me pantheon was probably the most impressive thing I have seen. I was really wowed when I walked down the road and suddenly wow pantheon in front of me.

AskReddit,femsrtb,t1_femohzx,1579268566.0,"In my country hiking is super easily accessible by both bus and trains. The mountains trains can go really up too. Its not all all unusual to see old people or family with kids on them. But it's just especially older people and young who use it of course. 

Same with alps. I took a train to alps with both my skis and my snb at the same time. Granted was kind heavy, but just wanted to have both. 

We also have special busses that include the drive there and daily skipass to Alps resort. Basically pay like 63 euros get a bus in the morning and the load the bus in the evening.

Basically what these countries did it was to make the recreation accessible to everyone.

But yes cars can be useful of course, but the thing is you don't need them, thats the freedom of public transport."

AskReddit,femrn5p,t1_fempmwb,1579267635.0,"It's because of the play. People were kinda hating on the actress that was cast because she was black. Then Rowling said Hermione could have been black. But its also pretty obvious she loved the film main cast. 

Honestly I feel like when it came out HP felt as I nice representation of old school type of school in UK. Its when the politically correct movement from eeh USA started getting prominent people were all like but but where are the black people. I felt she was getting inspiration from her own school life and she simply didn't have that super immigration background school. I mean there is just 3% black population in UK, obviously its can be every sedond character because that just disproportionate. There is more Indian, Pakistani Bangladeshi or Asian population in UK than Africa population. Outside London and minus Birmingham, I generally find UK very white. And she did have Asian and Indian characters in books. Yes, probably weren't the main 3 ones, but considering that the wizard families seems to be kinda tight clans, it makes sense it would be just white Brits as the 87% of population is. 

Its the same as when we had the Yennefer isn't white discussion with Witcher. The adaptation just changed it. I am am fine with that."
AskEurope,femn7b6,t3_epyfdx,1579263402.0,"Personally I don't like Christian charities, it think their development strategies sucked and what I saw was too much the white saviour stereotype, especially when they were playing it in African countries. They buy into the stereotype. However of course some can be good. 

So my fav is Nordic Radiaid. Too bad they are kinda dead now. I like charities that work with the local people and especially employ the local population. 

The local one I worked for People in Need, or People in Peril. They focus on buy a goat, buy a chicken nursery for the people but also support local empowerment and governance and agriculture. 

Don't donate to charities doing collections. For example African countries or Asia or anyone aren't interested in second hand clothes, bikes, tools from Europe. They make their own, so the best thing would be to donate to those who support local makers and local enterprises as it starts up the economy. Shipping it is pain in the ass and its super costly. Small charities just aren't able to pay for a cargo plane full of repaired bikes 

In Europe go locally. Each country has a list of the charities, so find a cause you like and focus on that, and yep a little bit on charity research is never a bad thing."
AskEurope,femmw5w,t3_epndtj,1579263059.0,"In politics hell yeah they love it. Or in the local government levels. Aka the environment protection group forbid this thing to be build, but voila the mayor of the town went with it because someone helped him.. 

But to be fair, tried that on police as a normal citizen, does not work. Only works in big sums now. Aka yep easy to bribe the local police district into maybe forgetting some old restrictions.

Or the Euro grants."
bigboobproblems,femh8kx,t1_fehvwg6,1579255412.0,"In one charity work we did, I could not get into a princess dress. It zipped halfway and then said nope on the boobs. Well luckily for me I got out of the shitty women are princesses attitude and got a dragon costume. Yeah."

bigboobproblems,femh0yk,t3_epluho,1579255094.0,"Generally you will find out. Talk to them and if they are interested in you and your hobbies and your life. 

My current SO, he didn't even know I had big boobs until we eh slept together. OK it was one night stand that evolved, but I was wearing one of those super oversized kinda snowboard type hoodies and short skirt. He was apparently shocked when I undressed.

But apparently what he liked first was my nose. I have a long nose, that I hate, but he seems to love so it works I guess. 

I learned to overturn the boob comments to guys. I worked in environment with 7 male coworkers and we joked a lot. They joked about my boobs I joked about something on them. I learned to deflect it back at them. Basically bro shittalking. However the normal ones will listen and that's the difference. 

Basically, if they only want to have a x, yes they will mention boobs maybe or just want to have sex. I mean do the same then, use them throw them. 

If they are interested in you you will see it. Because they will find a way to talk to you, they will listen and tried to get closer to you to know you.

But to be fair, it's kinda an appeal too. It's something they can't help but may find appealing. Like girls prefer boy who are teller, some prerefer boy who have beards (guilty here) some like muscular guys, some like little bit of a belly. 

Men are visual, so it's possible it's one of their first draws to you. But if they really want to stick around because they like you, you will see it. Because if you confine in them in for example how the boobs hurt your back, they will listen and support you."
