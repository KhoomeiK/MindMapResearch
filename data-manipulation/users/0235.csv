USB-C has the potential of pushing out a lot of energy, and unlike someone trying to charge an iPad through an iPod charger, I would hate it to be the other way round, but with even higher voltage. 

Are they expecting everything to be thunderbolt 3 grade becuse someone is going to try and charge a macbook pro with the USB-C cable that came with their USB powered reading light from China."
gadgets,ffj5qdq,t1_ffiudet,1579991075.0,"Kinda. It wasn't that long ago where every phone had its own charger, and that charger was wired in to plug, there was nothing you could do, oh your friends Nokia was dead, don't work I also got a Nokia, oh wait its 2 years older than yours so the charger isn't compatible!

Then pretty much everyone switched over to USB-A on their charger, and then a proprietary cable. You would get some confusion becuse an iPod shuffle charger gives out 0.5A, but an iPad Charger gives 2.5A But they looked the same.

Really its USB-C that has screwed things up a bit. I get its really versatile, but the alst thing i want to do is plug my 5Watt MP3 player into a laptop grade USB-C charger just becuse that's what the EU ordered!

However in terms of design, I love USB-C and have loved it for years. I went on holiday 6 months ago with my dad and his friend. they spent half the trip just trying to make sure their phones were in the right position to charge with slow micro USB charging. mix that in with older phones with dying batteries. All i would need to do is plug in for 2 hours every evening at the hotel!"
gadgets,ffirzyr,t1_ffidd5l,1579981244.0,"We pretty much already got 3 very solid standards, and most of those standards the other end of the cable is USB-A and you can then plug that into every USB-A phone charger.

 USB-C Power Delivery was the one that came along and screwed that up, and everyone is acting like they are saving the day.

The problem is just how many non-phone usb devices still use micro USB, and those devices tend to be designed to last decades, not years (like phones). But I bet the other end of those cables are USB-A!"
gadgets,ffir93u,t1_ffil6mw,1579980713.0,"Yeah. The EU cares about the charger not the cable. Ironically everyone was using USB-A on their chargers until USB-C came along and screwed it up.

This feels like something someone suggested to the EU 15 years ago (when literally everyone had a different hard wired charger) and it is just starting to get through to the EU for processing.

I literally have a single Anker charger that has a USB-A fast charge port and a USB-C PD port, with 5 different cables on my desk and you can bring me basically any device at work and I can charge it for you. My old iPhone USB-A charger also sees a lot of use because pretty much everything used that at one end of the cable.

But we also use a lot of non-phone tech that is USB charged. Barcode scanner PDA's, a mini handheld printer, handheld scanner, little door bippers. Guess what? They all charge perfectly fine from my iPhone charger, they just all need a special cable."
gadgets,ffiqi6f,t3_ets977,1579980192.0,"The big irony is that before USB-C, basically everyone was using USB-A connectors at the end of their charging cables, and in their chargers. 

When usb c came along it wanted everyone to switch over to using usb-c for both ends of a cable.

So what if one end of apples cable is some weird proprietary connector, the other end was always universal.

I could charge my iPhone, android usb-c phone, sat-nav micro usb, and PDA mini usb all with my iPhone charger and then use different cables. The second my usb-c laptop came along suddenly I needed another charger that could provide power to usb-c cables.

But the benefit of the USB-C port is huge. It's more than just power, but will also require educating people that just because it looks like a USB-C doesn't mean you can run hd video though it!"
Futurology,ffhtqiv,t3_eteahl,1579953443.0,"Except people are people. Where I live there is a set of traffic lights for a pedestrian crossing right at the exit to a roundabout. you can fit about 2 cars coming off the roundabout if the lights are red. This is the roundabout for the main road through the town that sees thousands of cars at rush hour.

Problem is becuse people are people those lights stay red FOREVER becuse they had a problem with pedestrians running just as they started to change. so they just made it red for longer. then pedestrians would run, and they made them longer. they now stay red for traffic for 25 seconds, EXITING a roundabout. its ridiculous.

people are people, and maths ain't going to fix that.

anyway, there was an advert tin the UK for some insurance company that had something just like this. cars never needed to stop for traffic lights as they just passed between each other in a connected grid.

The hard part will be making sure the system that is connected to every other car, GPS, wireless etc. completely separate from the system that keeps the car driving and users safe.

Bit the second there are facts about how broken the game is, it opens up a whole can of worms in people criticising the game. Bethesda have continued to utterly mismanage the release over a year later.

I agree that the turnout was quite high, but my original comment was supposed to be (and I explained it very poorly) about how not only did the leave campaign push hard to get those middle and undecided voters, but they also pushed hard to pacify the remain voters into believing leave could never win.

all you need to do is:

Splurge out a couple of adverts from the ""free Britain"" Facebook group towards people who show up groups focusing more on the nation which say something about ""freedom is under threat from Brussels""

Splurge out a couple of adverts from the ""United Europe"" Facebook page aimed at people who show up in a lot of open and globally facing groups saying ""Remain is secured, Brexit can't possibly win with this leadership"" then have a montage of the top 10 silly mistakes Farage has made.

You have, as one organisation, whipped up a load of people into wanting to vote leave, and then at the same time pacified people who you don't want to go out and vote.

The social media feed you and I see are completely different. Where I work we sometimes need to use Youtube, and whenever a work video has finished it starts autoplaying one of these terrible ""top 23 strangest cars"" videos that's just a slideshow of the first 23 images that pops up on google.

 Just like Brexit. I don't know anyone who voted to remain, as those that now complain about it decided not to go out and vote because of the weather. They were all convinced it would be a 95% victory, and instead it was a 49% loss.

Do your part. do your own research, and stay away from ANY news that uses Twitter as a source.

Edit: Let me just clarify, because obviously I made my point very poorly. Not only were people conned by social media with fear mongering and general lies into voting a specific way, people on the opposite side were also coerced into feeling like they were going to win comfortably, and it was devastatingly effective. Not only did they do one side of the campaign with whipping their own voters into a voting frenzy, they also pacified the opposition with news stories how victory was undisputed for them.

Look how basically everyone who wanted to remain was seeing news stories saying Brexit was never going to happen, it was safe as houses that remain would win? meanwhile everyone who was leaning more towards leave was getting scary stories about how the foreigners are about to invade, and everyone needs to do their best effort to make sure it goes through, come together as the underdogs!

Futurology,fdgs5o2,t1_fderqj6,1578406934.0,"I have toy drones that charge via low USB voltage that still take a few hours. Even if a drone ram for 2 hour charged for 4, how are you going to get a charging station in the literal middle of nowhere? The worst thing is you can't make it permanent. once the seeds are sewn, you move on to the next area.

Maintanence of trees around roads, existing built up areas etc could be an idea that works. We already have workforces that can close lanes of motorways to do work, what if it was a single lorry driving slowly with swarms of 10 minute run, 10 minute charge drones flying in and out of it?

But the idea this is technology expandable to anywhere in the world is a bit far reaching."

Futurology,fdem42s,t1_fdehlqi,1578341922.0,"And for employing a human for 30 years you can only buy 130 drones. Just 5 tree seeding drones a year. Then what about the drones needed to maintain the new forrest? So suddenly you are actually buying 2 seeding drones, and 3 maintanence drones. But wait, you also need to hire a person to deploy and maintain the drones

And currently the world record drone flight is 3 hours. That drone is $8,000. So for just 24 hours work is $64,000 worth of drones. That's just shy of a years wage for 3 person team capable of working 24 hours.

And that's just to buy the drone. Not maintain and operate them. Not to haul them back to a city to change, just to be put out for 3 hours again.

And the team are planting at a 70% survival rate Vs 10%. So to get the same survival rate you would need half a $400,000 worth of drones FOR ONE DAYS WORK at the same capacity as a 24 hour 3 person rota. 

So don't say a worker working for 30 years would cost half a million dollars, when just one day work of drones for the equivalent survival capacity would cost almost the same.

And you think a quadcopter is going to last 30 years without spares? Where does that money come from? The spare parts for the human are part of the wage. Spare parts for the drone are an equipment cost. Equipment cost of a tree planter, a shovel and a truck. 

Of course once the drones are paid for, that's a huge expense out of the way, there is much less ongoing expenses, but then what you are left with is a robot that can only fire seeds into the ground Vs a human that can do almost any other job except for that."
Futurology,fdegr2j,t1_fdee8uv,1578338672.0,"and survival rate of these drones SEEDING not Planting is probably only 10% at best. a drone capable of doing the seeding will be at least $4,000 just to buy it. for $1350 a month a tree planter maintains itself, a drone doesn't.

and when the world is save, a tree planter can go do something else. A drone can't and is stuck forever as a $4,000 tree planter and is no longer needed. off to landfill you go.

so for every person planting trees you would still need 1 drone seeding (as the drone can work non stop vs 3/4 shifts of people a day, but the drone is at least 4 times less effective with survival rates).

its still very much 50/50 what you pick. is a drone going to cost as much to run as a person, no. but will a drone last 30 years planting trees? hell no."
