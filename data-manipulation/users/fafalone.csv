And by the way, no matter how much you wish it wasn't true, no matter how unfair you think it is, no matter how right you think you are, if your goal is to increase empathy and broaden mindsets, telling every single white person they're all racists, have been racists since they were toddlers, are racists if they treat everyone equally, trying to redefine racism such to exclude what would clearly be racism if not for the color of ones skin... that's just not going to happen. It's breeding resentment. 


Also, to have a worldview like Carranza is to believe in the inherent genetic inferiority of black and Hispanic peoples. That's the only plausible explanation for doing them the massive disservice of saying, 'Well, your tests scores aren't equal, so we're just going to cover them up by not counting them, instead of addressing the underlying causes and making them equal.' If you believed they weren't intellectually inferior, you'd tackle the problems leading to the score difference instead. It's saying 'Well, we can't possibly expect black students to not be disruptive and violent, so we're just going to cover that up by not punishing them.'

He won't convert any Trump voters, and won't excite moderates who'd abstain if someone more liberal got the nod (and has major liabilities in civil liberties that actively dissuade progressives and civil libertarians). Short of a recession hitting very soon, the most viable path to victory is a candidate that drives up turnout with younger voters and other very liberal voters uninterested in a moderate; it's Warren, Sanders, or 4 more years of Trump. I really wish they weren't both running, they're splitting constituencies in ways Biden is not. If either dropped out, Biden would get crushed."
