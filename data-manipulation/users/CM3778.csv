college,ff50fq5,t1_ff4yjwb,1579576904.0,A specific role I’m interested in is financial analysts. It’s just an entry level position
college,ff4nglg,t1_ff4mg8l,1579567882.0,The whole barrier to entry thing is fucked. First they want you to bust your ass and spend lots of money (or take on debt) all while somehow gaining experience before graduation. It’s BS
college,ff4jnpe,t1_ff4jivg,1579565229.0,"I’m not gonna go back and spend more money. Especially since colleges aren’t transparent with future prospects relating to certain majors. I’m interested in medical sales, so might try to get into that if possible."
college,ff4i7ea,t1_ff4i38n,1579564221.0,"I’ve been applying for even teller positions and they still won’t give me a chance. Possibly because I have a degree, but it’s a vicious cycle."
college,ff42pu6,t1_ff4216g,1579554251.0,Well that’s rather depressing
college,ff3j3eu,t1_ff3i7ch,1579542126.0,"Idk about other people, but that make money doing it and that’s what matters haha"
college,ff3hyyl,t1_ff3fm4c,1579541434.0,I’m learning to realize that. Should have gone to trade school lol at least I learned how to day trade so that can make my money for now
college,ff2fovj,t1_ff2alfb,1579504170.0,I understand how you feel. Just graduated and all my friends have jobs but me. It’s really depressing
college,ff2cc80,t1_ff2bvht,1579500518.0,"My point is primarily that its very broken. Once you bust your ass through college and excited to start using your degree you’re hit with the whole “3-5 years experience thing.” From what I’ve heard, my parents generation didn’t have this type of situation. 
Just seems a bit ridiculous"
college,ff2b9xa,t1_ff2b0u2,1579499455.0,"Thanks for the input man, I definitely agree. I’m not in debt, that’s just how much school cost me. I don’t want to go to grad school unless I could get into medical school; which was my first major in school haha 

What are you studying in school?"
college,ff2aqt9,t1_ff2apg3,1579498944.0,Exactly. It is monotonous.
college,ff2aigg,t1_ff2agjc,1579498723.0,"But if that doesn’t go through, what would you recommend? The whole system seems quite broken."
college,ff2a37d,t1_ff29ypl,1579498322.0,"Portals such as LinkedIn, indeed etc? Then ya that’s all I’ve been doing. I do have some fraternity alum that I can get ahold of. I’ll try to get ahold of some of my college alum as well. The only issue I still see is that companies are not willing to take a chance on new grads with no relative work experience."
college,ff29fh7,t1_ff28wyq,1579497729.0,"Just entry level positions like financial analysts, credit analysts etc."
college,ff29e3d,t1_ff28xxd,1579497695.0,They did ask about it and I said I was just trying to gain experience and get my foot in door via the internship. I also mentioned I had plans of wanting to stay there after graduation. I felt that interview went quite well.
college,ff28sox,t1_ff28q3i,1579497154.0,"I didn’t go to a Target school, but I did my best to network. I’ve even reached out to old professors. We’ll see what happens. It’s only been a month but still equally frustrating"
college,ff27kas,t1_ff27g87,1579496082.0,Thing is I don’t see why college is held on a pedestal. Clearly it doesn’t hold the same value it once did. And these companies are delusional if they expect us to get out of school with multiple years experience.
