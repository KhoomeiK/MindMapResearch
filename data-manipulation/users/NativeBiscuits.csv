dogs,fekmbh2,t3_epjpxx,1579203022.0,"I work from home, so I am always with my 4 Pitties. Occasionally, I send them to daycare. That's usually when I have the odd day and I have to leave the house for work. I can tell you, my dogs spend most of the day sleeping. I have a day bed set up in my office, and they will literally spend the entire day on it sleeping. I have cameras set up around the house, so when I leave to run errands, I can see what they're up to. They sleep. Maybe get up to get a drink of water, fluff their pillows, and blankets. I've never felt bad for leaving them home when I had to work outside the home. I knew that if I didn't, they couldn't be spoiled like they deserve to be."
dogs,feeay6k,t1_fedvtbx,1579030020.0,"We had to upgrade from a queen to a king. Our 95 lb. Great Dane/Pitbull is a bed hog. It doesn't help that he's so big...but dang. He doesn't even try to share. Our other three (40 lb Boston Terrier/Pittie, and two 25 lb Pittie puppies) can manage to share the bed with us, and take whatever space Big Boy doesn't. I don't know what we're gonna do when the two puppies are grown or when we have kids. 
I really want one of those custom beds where you can fit an entire family of 5 or 6."

I have a cousin who doesn't know how to sign her name. When she and her husband were buying their house, she printed her name where the line said 'signature ' They had to redo the paperwork, which cost them money and delayed the purchase."
