I am an animal lover also who was appalled by your heartless comment to the guy who just lost his best friend. That was some bullshit bud. I'm also a man therefore I also am stupid and do and have done some seriously stupid things as men do. We are what we are, so I get it. But come on bro why kick a guy in his dick when you hear he is already as down as he can be? If you and I were at a bar you wouldn't have any teeth left and I'd be back in the clink. I cant help but step up for a guy who is dealing with such a loss and is attacked in such a low blow type of manner. Please bro admit that was shity and underhanded to do that to someone who's obviously experiencing one of the shityest and saddest things we unfortunately go through in life. Was worse than kicking him when down. Dont be that guy, nobody respects that guy. Your better than that, be the stand up guy your mama can be proud of. Or not, just please stop fucking with people who are already fucked. Please."

Somehow I (42 year old man, rides Harleys, carrys pistol) turned into the crazy cat lady! Never expected that to happen. But I am. I sit at home watching TV with my two old female cats who boss me around and simply use me for whatever they want in that moment. Life certainly can be trippy. 

    Please do feel completely fine about asking me to spend an entire day doing whatever she may require if you need to. I honestly wouldn't mind at all. And have got the time to accomplish most anything you may need. Again I also need opportunities to pay back some of the good that was given to me in my time of need. I'm a mama's boy who talks to my mom at least twice a week. My mom's a saint and is such a great mother I have many friends who also keep regular contact with her. I seriously got lucky and was raised right by an amazing lady. So I get how this must be difficult for you not being near her. Ironically my mom's in up state NY and I'm out here. Arnt you and your mom opposite of that? Anyway I'd like to get you my phone number or email or both. That way you won't have any issues contacting me if you had to. I dont check Reddit very often. Let me know whens a good time to PM me to get my number. And really please do use me to help out your mom. She deserves it, I need it for my mental health, and you get to feel like your helping your sick mom. Is a win win win."

Sure it stinks a little, but f*ck what would you expect from a older vagina thats seen way to many giant black cocks in it's day. The amazing thing is that shit doesn't just run down her leg all the time the way her asshole has been abused over the years. Its her own fault for always finding bigger and bigger things to stimulate her anus with. We told her she had to stop when she started taking 3 to 4 dicks at once in her poor stretched out brown eye. She didn't listen and soon regularly had a mans arm shoved in there, clear up to the elbow! Last I remember she could fit an entire 2 litter in that thing without much warm up. Is no wonder she required depends full time from that point on. That poor ladys arse must never come close to holding things back at this point. Just is a giant pink canyon of anal destruction at this point. But whatever, as long as she's happy who are we to judge?  I just wish she didn't let so many niggers have their way with her all the time. She seems to really love those porch monkeys more and more the worse they treat her. Poor white trash skank letting those giant black cocks take over her entire life, is all she thinks about."

You definitely still live with your mama and most likely will be under her thumb till she leaves your ignorant unproductive pointless ass.  Have fun with yourself seeing as nobody wants anything to do with you. You must get sick of stroking it yourself? But if thats all you've ever known I guess its easier to accept.

MakeNewFriendsHere,fdjfscs,t3_elhezn,1578468930.0,"So very sorry. I was lucky enough to live with my green iguana James for almost 24 years before he passed two xmases ago. I think of him daily. Fuck I still cry sometimes. Strange I didn't shed a tear when my father died. Lost my best friend the day before Thanksgiving this year and again no tears. But man if I think about James I tear right up. 
         Thats the down side to loving animals, they tend to last under 20 years and it sure is hard when they gotta go. But its so worth it. They make life so much better and teach us so much. They make us better people than we were before they became part of our lives. 
         If you can what kind of dog was he? And how long did you get with him? I get it if you simply cant talk about it right now so don't answer if you don't want to. But know that you made that dogs life awesome. I'm sure you were his world basically and that you loving and caring for him made his entire life great/happy! Thats huge. You both were very lucky to have eachother. Good luck, I hope you get to have the love from another animal in the future. And I hope you get as close to that one as you did this one, when your ready. Again so very very sorry."
Assistance,fdjejth,t3_elhyar,1578467499.0,"Here in Boulder County there's a foundation called ""sister carmens"" that literally does almost everything. From helping with monthly expenses to a food pantry thats always full even meals on wheels. They can help a great deal. 

     Also I'm disabled and so have entirely to much free time so would actually appreciate something to do. If that something includes helping someone then I'm all about it! Not sure where your mom is but if possible I'd be happy to do anything I can to help out. Again I live in the Lafayette/Louisville area, I have wheels and literally am available at any time. 
         When I got disabled and needed time to heal up sister carmens kept me from losing everything and brought me food every day. If it weren't for the kindness of strangers I'd of been completely screwed. I got no family or anything out here so was/am on my own whether I can walk or not. Therefore the help they provided was everything to me. I hope your mom lives around here so I can help you out anyway possible, need to pay back some of what I received. Please let me know if there's anything you think I can do. For real anything at all. I don't have much $ but can help out in other ways. Hope to hear from you."

But were willing to help anyway. People with money walk on by unwilling to do right and help a fellow human in distress. 

      Unfortunately there's not many poor people around here to help when you need. The answer shouldn't be move to a slum. The answer should be raising your kids right so they are compassionate people who care for others."
Assistance,fdgyxww,t1_fcawk82,1578411710.0,"Sorry about long response. Each time I broke something I was backing my Electra Glide out of garage. It weighs 998lbs dry. I was already hit by car on my motorcycle in 2010. In that accident I suffered 4th degree burns from waist down, lost right ankle, left thigh bone replaced with cadaver bone, shattered left side hip. All three times I got hurt in my driveway were directly after I relearned to walk again and was trying to learn how to move big bike around. It seemed I wasn't going to be physically able with my weak/burned bones in my legs. My friends all said get a trike and give up two wheels your to crippled. But I figured it out. Its been years now and no more injuries in driveway, still ride a 1000lb bike and love every minute on it. I know I'll be hit again. It's worth it to me."
SuicideWatch,fchfyux,t1_fcedrnu,1577650129.0,"Awesome!! Sort of went on tangent. Gave you way more information than was needed. But guess I just have a lot to share cause I have had a very full and interesting life so far. I have been through more that i thought anyone could go through and live through it. Honestly am very surprised to be here now, didn't think I'd make it. Found out its absolutely amazing what you can make it through when it comes to physical pain as well as mental pain. I don't think anyone thought I would get through. Think because I've almost always been dealing/getting through one thing or another that I was capable of making it through things that would have been to much for most. However I'm had so much to get through because I make bad choices. And seem not to learn a thing unless i get hit hard right in my face. Not good. Am 42 now and sorry to tell you but I'm still the same way. You'd think I'd of learned how to avoid the things that so difficult to deal with. But not at all. Have much much more horrible shit that I've had to find ways to get through. If you really benefit from my storys of getting to this point I'd be willing share all i got with you to make sure you get through your own dark spots. I'd actually be very happy to help you if you want it. Would be great if someone else got help from the lessons i had to struggle through. Would make them all much more worth getting through. 
   Am an open book so you never can offend me, so ask me anything you want to know whenever you need. Also am always looking to help someone. Is the the only thing that i get joy from the last few years. And need it! Have been in the darkest place Ive ever been in the last few years. Again thought it really was going to be the one that beat me. Even asked my mom for permission to die a couple years back. Was so tired of being so miserable and living without hope is very hard. Is unnatural also, never had to contend with that before and was/is nearly to much to live with. But my mama said ""NO!"" So have no options. My mom is awesome! I love her alot. She's 75 and lives 2000 miles away from me. Am a mama's boy always have been, i say with pride. Can't put her through my death. Thats why i asked for permission. 

    I really do hope you find something that helps you deal with the bad shit you got in your life at moment from my struggles. Look forward to hearing from you. If you choose to take on by yourself i stiill believe you can do it and will understand. Will be here should you need help at any time. But hope you take the easy way and use me, and my experience."

    Dont believe what your family says. Your good people and just need a chance to find yourself and happiness. You can do it though. Isn't easy for everyone they need to piss off! Please ladys don't give up. Your so young that i gotta believe your going to meet a guy who will do right by you and things will fall into place. Shit, just realized not sure if your both into men.

   Also sorry for losing your sister. I thought that the od's were slowing down finally but guess not. From small up state town and a couple years ago they were losing a couple kids a week. In a town of 3000. Was unreal. Thank god that slowed or most the population would be dead. I now live in beautiful Colorado and although we have heroin here ive never known of a od. Guess im lucky.

Dont understand how they can do that to a person they ""love"" i know i sure couldn't. My mama raised me right however. Im a single guy who wouldn't ever hurt someone i love and theres a bunch of us out there. Fear and love are very different but it seems these little pussy guys dont care as long as they get one from you, love or fear they don't care. Is about control not making you happy like you deserve. Please ladys dont give these idiots the time of day. They don't deserve you and dispite what they tell you not one has ever changed. He has no interest in changing. Theres so many of us lonley single guys out there i see no reason for a lady to be abused for some time. You truly are someone who deserves the best and should be treated that way girls.

I think because of that he knew how to throw punches cause he was not a big man, 5'10"" but is only man to litteraly send me flying through air from a punch. Ive been in more than 100 fights since and have never been hit near that hard. And Ive faced some big dudes. Even got ass beat by pro MMA middle weight. Dont think i even got a single punch in. Still loved it. I'm not normal at all. 
    Anyway what i wanted to say to you is hang in there. And stop giving them power by wishing for death because they are treating you wrong. You have so much to look forward to and to miss any of it because they suck is bullshit!  You are at a point in life where in just a few short years your going to change so much you cant even wrap your head around it. You will not be the boy you are today at all. And you can then do your own thing if ya need to. I left at 17 and never looked back. Got emancipated so i could go to college on my own. I was super lucky and had a girlfriend from 16 to 27 and that made it much easier i think. She kept me on right path, and felt loved by her so didnt miss parents.

I know this from living it. Is unreal how shit changes and your like fuck never even knew life could be this way. Not to mention the shit that matters to you now, may not mean shit in a little bit. Please try my friend."
SuicideWatch,fc6x08q,t3_egiz9s,1577491669.0,Perhaps they just cant see a weakness in you or it will take their rock away? If they use you to get through whatever in their lives then it makes sense that they simply cant see the stuff that is hurting them also hurting you. If it hurts you as well then they lose the strong person they need to be stronger than themselves. Maybe you somehow show them what they have such a hard time with you dont even notice. Giving them hope of becoming untouched by the crap that brings us down. Someone has to be the one looked up at. It sucks to be that guy but we don't choose to be him we are born that person weather we like or not. You need to learn to step back and get yourself happy and healthy from time to time. Not easy but you will figure it out.
SuicideWatch,fc6w4fw,t3_egicys,1577491020.0,"Did you say you have a daughter? Then you dont get to make this decision. When you decided to have a child or at least knowingly took a risk that you could produce children you took most all options away from yourself. You made your life about her not about you anymore. She needs you 100% dispite you being weak and ignorant at this moment she will be much better off with you there when your not experiencing such a hard time and are able to see things much more accurately. At moment your seeing things with a negative view. So cant see whats real. We all do this. Your not more of a idiot than most are. Actually you must be better than most to have gotten a lady to love you enough to breed with you. But when us humans are down we seem to have very little ability to see anything but us being down with zero good at all. But its not really the way your brain is telling you it is. We do same thing with thoughts of positive. Then we don't see that we could fail. Or that we may be causing horrible shit to occur in our lives. We almost think we somehow are invincible no negative stuff can even effect us. But it sure can and its there even though we think its not. 
   Stop and remember that your little girls life will be much easier on her if your a part of it. Without you see is much more likely to deal with shit that will only hurt her or take options away from her that you would want her to have. Why condemn your little girl to being the way we currently are? Dont you want better for her. Want her to never know the darkness you currently feel?  Then make sure your making that happen. Please we don't need more pissed off kids that are miserable here on earth. We got to many already. Dont be responsible for making more miserable people. If you are as sad as you say then you should agree the worst thing you could do in life is cause someone else to feel that way. Please just do whatever to get through the next little bit of time. I promise you'll be so glad your here if you do. Your little girl may even make your life so amazing you cant even comprehend anyone being that happy and live better than you thought possible for anyone. I think you should let the happiness take over and live happier than anyone ever has, all cause you got super lucky and had a little girl to devote your life to. I truly am jealous! I wish I was that lucky. You better not take for granted. 

 And theres absolutely no way at all that your daughter would be better off or happier without you in her life. Thats bullshit and you know it. Ever meet someone who is without one of the parents? Can you see them saying they wouldn't rather have mom and dad in their lives? Unless your a pedophile or similar they want you involved. Go live your kick ass life with your daughter you lucky prick."
SuicideWatch,fc6sftb,t3_egi7gs,1577488314.0,"Google can help you. Is worth looking into seeing as its a permanent outcome. Permanently crippled or permanently dead. Seems like something you may wish to spend time educating yourself on. However if under 35 years old then you got no business thinking of actually doing it anyway. Honestly takes most male humans that long to figure out who they are and what they truly want out of life. I am very glad I never followed through and didn't think I'd ever feel that way. But you really cant be making decisions that end everything until you have lived more life, takes a bit to get the lessons you need to understand certain things. Not that your stupid or slow or anything. Think most human males will say similar stuff. We think we know shit but later find we did not. So avoid anything with permanent side effects. You also should avoid anything that may just make your situation far worse. Like not doing enough to kill you and simply taking your ability to function from you. Imagine waking to find your a vegetable requiring your mom to wipe your ass for the next 40 years. Happens alot. Dont be next."
SuicideWatch,fc6r5q4,t1_fc6ob8k,1577487380.0,"Good choice! In future just so ya know drugs are much more likely to permanently mess you up as opposed to kill you so you probably wouldn't like the outcome of taking excess drugs. And each person reacts differently to them so is hard to say what will be outcome if you take a large amount. No good can come of it i promise. And i also can promise you that you will regret taking them some day. Cause no good will come from such behavior. Just cut your manhood off and go insane, will provide you with same outcome. Hope you get happy with yourself and never feel anything similar again."
SuicideWatch,fc6q3gz,t3_eghozo,1577486631.0,"Dont be so hard on yourself. Big deal so you ruined a friendship. People do that all the time. I dare say everyone does that at least once. You see we are all young and stupid for a decent period of time in the average life. We do things that we aren't proud of during that period. Most of us learn from the stupid shit we do and cause therefore we move on making sure not to repeat the things we are not proud of. Especially if it hurt others or in a worst case hurt a friend who may simply drop you because thats easiest and requires the least effort on their part. If you chill out and grow a little older you'll be much more accepting of the stupid shit you tend to do from time to time. We are human after all so dont expect so much. Also we are male so have testicles, anything with testicles is inherently ignorant. This is true no matter what species your talking about. Woman are much smarter and do less stupid shit but thus far in history haven't got the credit they deserve. Men don't seem to want them to find out that they truly are superior and clearly are more intelligent. Is so obvious that i can't believe they haven't put us in our place yet. I'm not even very bright, yet this jumps right out to me. So chill bro you fucked up, wont be the only time or the biggest mistake either i can promise you. As long as your paying attention and dont keep doing same stupid shit again and again nobody will hold against you. They expect us to do stupid shit. All men through out history have. Is what human men do. Only human men have a hard time with this fact. Get used to it, don't be so critical."
SuicideWatch,fc6nh16,t3_eghhrg,1577484768.0,Im guessing your under 23? Where approximately are you in this world?  What about your mama? You think she will just ignore your death? I'd honestly like to know these things. Am genuinely concerned with why you are having such a rough time.
SuicideWatch,fc6n125,t3_eghhrg,1577484455.0,Sorry but your just going to black out never to remember what happens from now till about 12 hours from now with that dose. Been there done that. Sorry buddy. You dont get to leave here just yet.
SuicideWatch,fc5j4z2,t1_fc5hyjv,1577459022.0,Not sure if I count or can make you feel better but your welcome to spill the beans with me. If i can help you i will. Will definitely be honest.
SuicideWatch,fc5iahy,t1_fc5hovb,1577458365.0,"Also, sorry your other friends suck. I'm a complete stranger but seriously don't want you to do anything that prevents you from learning. If you manage to get through this shity spell I promise you'll find yourself looking back in a few years also very glad you chose to stay. Its absolutely unreal how much change can happen in a short amount of time."
SuicideWatch,fc5hovb,t3_egbuol,1577457892.0,"Your definitely doing the right thing. And your lucky to have a friend that your close enough to trust. Happy to help you in anyway I can also just tell me how. Am brutally honest, be warned."
SuicideWatch,fc5gxld,t3_egbmqz,1577457283.0,"The trick is not to think. So use anything that will prevent you from realizing what your doing. But the other guy has a point, you could just make your life way worse if you didn't die. So perhaps you need to look into methods more."
SuicideWatch,fc5etmi,t3_eg9wxc,1577455492.0,"You just said it. I come here when i start thinking of ending myself. I find if i help others it makes me so much better. Try it. 
 If we go to next life with knowledge of who we were here and we gave up here i fear that we will have fucked us in that life as well. So fear suicide a little. Would hate to make every life suck like this one has. Good luck. Use drugs if you have to."
SuicideWatch,fc5dx65,t1_fc5dtws,1577454669.0,Sorry i keep jumping around. Im trying to multi task and clearly am above my pay grade. Sorry.
SuicideWatch,fc5dtws,t3_eg9wxc,1577454585.0,"I hear that. Is same way for me. Getting so I don't want anything to do with ""them"" anyway. They simply have no f*cking clue."
SuicideWatch,fc5dj17,t1_fc5cvs6,1577454297.0,"How old are you? Your way to hard on yourself. What are you serounded by perfect people? 
  Nobody has advice for me cause I have unique issues. To touch on so you know Im not full of shit... Was in motorcycle accident at 33. Suffered 4th degree burns from waist down as well as many broken bones and my face was peeled back, near off. Yes my penis was burned, completely off. No more fucking for me, ever. Took me 2 years to learn to walk again. Lost everything in that time. Had business was successful. Lots of friends. Had been homeless crack head. Cleaned up was on top for few years. Then god said ""fuck you""."
SuicideWatch,fc5czxc,t1_fc5cdiy,1577453777.0,You'd be surprised what you can handle when needed. I certainly wouldn't think I could do this if looking from outside either. But I really am here so what choice do I have? Its the loneliness that gets to me.
SuicideWatch,fc5byre,t3_eg9wxc,1577452711.0,"Never understood the cutting thing. Seems like a cry for help to me. I say that cause Ive been and still am very depressed and basically have no feelings. I have a tolorance for pain that gets me into trouble. So cutting myself isn't going to do very much. Certainly wouldn't make me feel better like I deserved it. But I'm f*cked up and the older I get the more f*cked up I discover I am. Chicks dig scares though so maybe I should have rethought that when I was still hoping to meet ladys. Was in a motorcycle accident and suffered 4th degree burns from waist down. Yup, my penis was burned near completely off. Gives me a reason to continue using drugs."
SuicideWatch,fc5b7xt,t3_ega9iv,1577451894.0,"I do care. Your right however that if you ended yourself my life would basically be unaffected I'm not someone to bullshit you. And this will most likely piss you off as well but from where I sit your situation is a major upgrade. I have major issues that will never change and have lost so much that I have zero hope of ever getting anything close back. And I litteraly am a weird 42 year old man that lives alone with two cats and never leaves his house. Had friends but slowly they all moved on. Its been years since I've heard from any of them. I got my 70 year old neighbor and my highschool sweetheart who may call once a month. Was with her from 15 to 27 but we grew apart. We have always remained great friends though. Am very lucky to have her. 
  I spared you details because I'm not trying to out do you in reasons to be depressed. If you want to know ask and I'll discuss any and all my issues. I'm an open book you cant offend me. I told you as much as i did so you would at least know i am capable of understanding what your going through. I'm also a fuck up, I also consider suicide. I'd like it if you felt up to talking, perhaps arguing about our situations. And if one can help the other then awesome. Feel free to hit me up. If your not up to it I get that. Wish you luck and hope you get through this."
SuicideWatch,fc59zoj,t3_egakvh,1577450481.0,Happy to talk to someone. Am a guy with plenty of problems(understatement). Hope to help someone. When i start wanting to die I end up helping others to make myself stop wanting death. How can i help you get through this? Also Im a open book so ask anything or say anything you cant offend me.
SuicideWatch,fc59np3,t3_eg9cia,1577450074.0,"The person who wrote the first comment hit the nail on the head. I was a depressed teen with a very abusive father who was a high ranking cop so nobody dared say or do anything dispite me walking around with a black eye most the time. Maybe I had f*cked up friends but most all of them were dark and discussed suicide from time to time. Only a few followed through. I'm 42 now. Often I think of them and always think and sometimes say out loud ""if you had just been able to stick it out a little longer"". You entire world changes after highschool. I mean seriously changes in ways that you simply cant grasp until you live through it and gain a bit more experience. I'm nothing like the boy the people in my hometown knew. I'm a decent person who enjoys helping people. I used to be a hate filled violent young man that bullied and hurt people alot for no reason. Once I left home and didn't have anyone abusing me I became a totally different guy. I became someone I liked.
  Unfortunately at 33 I was in a motorcycle accident and suffered 4th degree burns from waist down as well as many other injuries. Took me two years to learn to walk again. In that time i lost everything. I had started a successful business that i lost, had to sell everything I owned to get through those first couple of years. Was unreal hard. I currently battle with loneliness and abusing drugs. Sometimes I do consider suicide but my mom is still alive and I cant put her through my death. Even asked her for permission to die once, she said no. Physical pain is something i deal with always, without any break at all. So I know what your dealing with. Please I know you probably could give a shit what a 42 year old man has to say but please do whatever you need to so that you make it to your mid twenty's. I promise if you can do that you will also find your life and yourself are nothing like the person you were at 15. Again the change is absolutely huge. One last promise, you'll be so happy you made it and that somehow you survived these teen years your currently stuck with. Feel free to message me whenever for whatever if you need. Will always tell it the way it is. Good luck."
SuicideWatch,fc57vy8,t3_eg9wxc,1577447736.0,"Am wondering why your bothering to be clean if you just want to die? Good job getting and staying clean for 11 months though. I definitely don't believe I could do that. Have been on most everything available at one time or another. Am 42 now and still love drugs. Don't do alcohol or cocaine, or anything requiring a needle but will happily do most other things."
