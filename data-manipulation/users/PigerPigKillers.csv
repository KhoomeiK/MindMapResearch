socialanxiety,ff6m4h5,t3_eraqp1,1579630128.0,"When I was a kid I was the most extroverted and outgoing kid at school...(Before u read this, no I am not lying/trying to get attention and everything I say is true)
Ok, I still remember in kindergarten I would be making ""treasure maps"" with levels and challenges on a paper and the whole students in the cafeteria/ playing together or smthing would come to play with me! So I would be playing with over 50 kids... then, as I grew and so did my *friends*, less people started playing with me, 2nd grade was the last year when more than 20 people played with me( I was still outgoing) and then 3rd grade only 5... but I didnt have anxiety yet, I was still liked and I would talk to people normally, I would be the one to start the conversation!
In 4th grade, I got a special new friend... My 4 usual friends were all absent that day, so I was asking many kids if I could play with them but they weren't even playing anything.... so I found a kid walking alone, I never seen him before, I thought he was new. I asked him if I could hang out w him for the break and he accepted! Nothing much to say, we where asking each other simple questions (what's ur fav color and shit) and then I asked him the question that based our friendship...""Do you play minecraft?"" As soon as I asked him he said ""of course!"" We started really being interested in talking with each others! He also told me he isnt new his mother is a teacher so he was here from the beginning and I didnt know him! So the next day, my friends were also absent! So I directly went to my new friend ""Jason"" and we talked about minecraft all day... It's because we were the ONLY kids that played minecraft in our classes... that's something special for us... so I told him next week to hang out w me and my friends and he accepted! (Btw he was the first Male friend I had uwu)(no that doesnt mean I had girlfriends)(I had one in kindergarten and she got cancer and died)(damn I should stop talking my brain being dark today)
So I'm not gonna continue if nobody is gonna read dis so someone tell me if they want to know what happened next cuz I'm tired typing"
