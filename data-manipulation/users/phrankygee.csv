That Henry Jackman theme is entirely the problem. It fit the tone of Winter Soldier perfectly, and it's amazing film scoring in its own right, but it basically bifurcates Cap into two different characters. Modern, edgy Cap and Old-fashioned boy scout Cap.

While they were doing this, Trump invited help from Russia live on television, and hired a very questionable cast of characters who all seemed to be talking to Russia in very suspicious ways.

Young people with jobs and college classes are more likely to be Democrats, and have a harder time getting to the polls.

It's not from a place of anger or malice. I used to think a bunch of stuff that isn't true, and it made life not make sense. Now my life makes sense, because I am not doing mental gymnastics all the time to make my beliefs ""mesh"" with observable reality.

It's a brutally painful experience to shed such deeply ingrained beliefs, and past a certain age I don't think I even recommend it, but it feels really good to come out the other side of the process. If someone comes on a public forum to ask questions about religion, I am going to share my two cents. This is not a sub specifically for Christians."

Chattanooga,fels52c,t1_fekekod,1579229588.0,??? What's the difference? It's a place full of Air Force people doing Air Force things. We can't call that an Air Force Base?
skeptic,felrni2,t1_fekmxe3,1579229255.0,"Well, if you aren't canceling, then they don't really care about your complaint. They will take your angry money just as fast as they will take your happy money."
NoStupidQuestions,felr2vu,t1_fele02t,1579228870.0,"I am also surprised by the lack of atheist responses.

My fellow non-believers can be insulting at times, however a lot of atheist responses to a question like this can SEEM insulting when they are not intended as such. (I will reiterate, some atheists ARE just assholes, though. You have to be some level of stubborn to fail to assimilate into the culture you are born into.)

The correct answer to this question is ""If Jesus existed at all, he might or might not have 'ugly cried' at some point in his life, but stories first written down 80 years or more after the time he would have lived are no basis to judge anything by.""

If someone posted a question here seriously asking how to ""use the force"", like in the movie Star Wars, there's no way to answer that question honestly without being a little insulting to the person asking. They're looking for a factual answer for a fictional scenario.

There's nothing to do with that but, as respectfully as possible, note that the question is based on a false, or at least questionable, premise."

MagicArena,felfrgg,t1_fek2kp6,1579221127.0,"It's not about what people *deserve.* It's about incentives and risk and multiplying resources. 

If you drive your car around your city, I bet you can find a dozen people who don't have a car, but  ""deserve"" to have a car. Why don't you buy all of those people cars? They deserve it. It's because the money to get those people cars has to *come from somewhere,* and you can't afford it.

Governments work the same way. The resources for everyone to have the good life that they deserve have to *come from somewhere*

Right now, we are on the end of the pendulum where we can EASILY pay for massive benefits for everyone just by raising taxes on rich people. So the answer to the question is easy right now. Small increases on taxes on the wealthy can reap giant rewards for everyone.

BUT, those rich people that are paying for everything for everyone  got rich because of capitalism. Get rid of capitalism altogether, and eventually, your kids and grandkids will start to have serious problems, because there aren't any rich people to tax to pay for things, because nobody has incentives to take risks necessary to CREATE the wealth that supports the economy.

That's why The American system, mostly capitalist, but WITH a robust socialist safety net, is as close to perfect as any system of government the world has seen. We need the Socialist part, AND the capitalist part to make it work."
MagicArena,fek1q1q,t1_fejo96q,1579190736.0,"Yeah. If your goal in life is to be a poor person, then it is much better to live in Switzerland or Denmark.

But is your goal to be the best kind of poor person, or is it to STOP being a poor person?

Who are the most notable entrepreneurs in Switzerland or Denmark? I don't know any. 

Are people from South Africa and Austria and India and all over the world moving to Switzerland or Denmark? Because America is so enticing to the rest of the world that people have continued emigrating here in numbers that are pretty amazing. So my guess is we're doing something right still."
MagicArena,fejnj61,t1_fejiuw7,1579180823.0,"People shouldn't all share an equally shitty quality of life either. Ask some former Soviet folks how awesome their non-competitive system was. Check out North Korea's kick-ass economy, where no one is allowed to compete for a good quality of life.

Economic freedom gives you losers and winners. Lack thereof just gives you all losers."
magicTCG,fejn3rt,t3_epf2dl,1579180437.0,This is really cool. Thanks for sharing.
MagicArena,fejic17,t1_fejfcrd,1579175532.0,"This universe. The one where immigrants from literally every other country in the world have come to America because of its promise of opportunity.

We lost our way over the last few decades, but the American system of a capitalist economy with a socialist safety net works fantastically well, compared to other systems out there.

If the system gets a little too competitive, you get pushback toward social fairness like we're seeing now. If the system gets too non-competitive, you get pushback the other direction, toward capitalistic competition."
