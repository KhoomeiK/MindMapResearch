I am pointing out - there are a lot of bigots just like him in the world that will act as an echo chamber and reinforce his shit views. He will probably feel warm and cozy with his right wing friends.

Pointing out that *someone else* is a bigot does not make *me* a bigot."
facepalm,fguf9zc,t1_fgudvuf,1581119374.0,...because I'm pointing out that bigots exist?
facepalm,fgu9ewb,t1_fgtvmvs,1581115438.0,"> difficult and lonely road

That dude is probably 50+ and the bar he hangs out at is probably full of people just like him. Bigots make up like 1/3rd of the US population."
VaporwaveAesthetics,fgtbsm0,t3_f0cx51,1581102208.0,"Very cool. Just a tip - advertising is much more effective when the product is already available. In the future, I'd recommend waiting until your album is already out, but I like the direction nevertheless."
dataisbeautiful,fgl6ig1,t1_fgl2z5g,1580883693.0,"Not really extortion, at least not in real life. In Eastern Europe for example (where corruption is rampant), no politician or official is ever going to risk making a threat out loud (ie, give me money or you won't get this business permit, or give me money or else you go to jail). It's simply situationally implied that you're going to have a hard time here - or perhaps that business license you're looking for? ""Sorry, it's out of my hands."" They're never going to even suggest that making a payment is necessary so that they can never be implicated as initiating such a deal (unless it's an extremely remote ass backwards place where they're more upfront).

Ohh, but if money just magically appeared in the official's drawer the next day, well that might get things moving.

It's still bribery, and it's absolutely how legitimate business is run in many parts of the world."
funny,fgj3gt9,t1_fgiok6h,1580836265.0,"My cousin always looks highly suspicious whenever we go shopping together. It's extremely frustrating. Can you please not go rummaging through the back of the racks like you're trying to hide something from the cameras? Can you please not toss stuff in your personal bag before you've paid for it? Omg, wtf man, stop opening boxes and tossing the packaging aside! And yet, 100% legit. No shoplifting even though that's exactly what it looks like."
facepalm,fg4352v,t1_fg3zk2u,1580495170.0,"Oh man! Those were the days. In the 90s, my mom surprised me once and said we had enough box tops from the cereal that I could order a free toy. I was so excited. It was delivered probably 6-8 weeks later (as they always used to say back then). Well, in little kid time, I had totally forgotten about it at that point, so it was like a second surprise!

Now with Amazon, you know exactly what you're getting and when you're getting it. Not as much fun I guess."
OldSchoolCool,fffibq4,t1_fffa1g2,1579884583.0,"The prosthetics were such a waste in that movie. IMO, he didn't look like Bruce Willis no matter how you cut it. ""The Kid"" did it better. Here's a kid that looks nothing like Bruce Willis but fuck you, it's him. Just believe it. Not even Bruce Willis recognizes his own younger self in the movie."
AmazonAnswers,fen3c94,t3_eq1ve7,1579276052.0,"Basically, some boomer thought that would be the most hilarious way to reply in the history of mankind. I know since my dad and his boomer buddies thought this phrase had to be the funniest concept in all of time, and surely if the dinosaurs were around, they'd think it's funny too. We'd win them over with that joke actually.

Meanwhile millennials are like, uh yea, we actually put stuff up our butt - for pleasure.

And then boomers are absolutely mortified by the literal act of shoving things up a butt. Despite how normal (or mundane) it might be to ya know, a normal person."
dataisbeautiful,fekeeun,t1_feke4aj,1579198312.0,"Indeed, an unfortunate fact."
dataisbeautiful,fekdacr,t1_fekchpj,1579197639.0,"I think the big reason that MTL reminds me of Europe is because your suburbs are not traditional American suburbs - they are thick, highly dense neighborhoods that are squashed together. The suburbs of major American cities like Boston are long sprawling landscapes where everyone has a yard, swimming pool, trampoline, and room for the dog to run. Where Montreal is A LOT of townhouses - very similar to how Europe is designed.

You are right - it's not exactly European, but compared to the US, much of Quebec is definitely a few shades more European than the neighbors South."
dataisbeautiful,fek900y,t1_fej69st,1579195110.0,"If you come to New England, the suburbs of Boston can stretch 40+ miles outside the city. Drive 15 minutes Southeast of Montreal and you are in rural farmland. Also, drive from Montreal to Quebec city and besides Trois-Rivières there is hardly anything in between besides stuff lining the route there (just like Europe). Now drive from Boston to NYC and there's tons and tons of suburbs in between."
dataisbeautiful,fej1sf5,t1_fej1jrz,1579153785.0,"Oh yes, I'm aware :) in Belgium, they are much closer together compared to other countries. I was more trying to illustrate to Americans what European cities are like, to help visualize."
dataisbeautiful,fej1ik6,t1_fej04ll,1579153525.0,"Agreed. If you want a little taste of it closer to home, much of Québec was designed the European way (not all, but many parts). It even looks like Europe in many parts too!

The rest of the US and Canada is all designed for the automobile - lots of boring suburbia."
dataisbeautiful,fej15yq,t1_fej11wd,1579153185.0,"2 ***HOUR*** commute? Christ, in many parts of Europe you'd be in another country by that point."
dataisbeautiful,feiz3h9,t1_feihri9,1579151301.0,"Sorry to tell you, but this map is not helpful for what you're talking about. Belgium is divided horizontally with Flanders/Wallonia (Flanders in the North, Wallonia in the South). The Northern half is Flemish, the Southern half is French. The only small part that speaks German is a tiny little piece on the East.

Hopefully that clears things up for you."
dataisbeautiful,feixk1a,t1_feiwt0g,1579149985.0,"Yep, that's right. But one nice thing about it is that you can still find ""city life"" in Europe (in a small city I mean) for a very reasonable price, since many places in Europe are just small cities. So for example, in the United States, if you can't afford to live in the city, your only other option is basically to live in the 'burbs or rural farm life, which sucks. But in Europe, if the big city is too expensive, at least there are smaller cities nearby that can still offer city life without being prohibitively expensive. At least that is the impression I get from friends that live in Europe in small/midsize cities.

In the US, if you're in an expensive city like San Fran, NYC, or Boston, there's not many alternatives - you're stuck with the suburbs."
dataisbeautiful,feil3fo,t3_ep8npm,1579141043.0,"For Americans wondering how this high density works out in the real world - Belgium, like much of Europe, is basically a series of small cities without ""suburbs"" in the North American sense. You'll be driving, and there's fields of nothing for 20 minutes, then boom! A little city. Get out of that city, drive another 20 minutes of wheat fields. Boom! Another little city."
dataisbeautiful,feia100,t1_fei6ymm,1579133640.0,"Agreed. Unfortunately, it really comes down to a numbers game."
dataisbeautiful,fei9t0j,t1_fei5vvp,1579133492.0,"Good point.

At the end of the day ""the customer is always right"" doesn't literally mean the customer is correct, but that the customer is the deciding fate of a product. And sadly, most consumers don't give a shit."
explainlikeimfive,fei4kgf,t1_fehx5d8,1579130137.0,"You're right about the economic side, but you're wrong about porn. The economic benefits did come first, but porn absolutely exploded the VHS market as a result of that. What you say about price and length is correct, except that is precisely why porn studios were able to pump out a truckload of titles for a fraction of the price of Betamax. Look up photos of adult video stores in the 80s and 90s. There were super stores in NYC, Germany, and France that had thousands of VHS porn titles - think 5-10 times more movies than a regular video store with multiple floors. This was a big win for VHS."
dataisbeautiful,fei0ez3,t1_fehy20j,1579127578.0,"Again, what you say is totally true - for major labels.

When it comes to alternative and indie labels, I distinctly remember a friend who released an electronic album said he got something like $8 from each $17 CD (or it was something like half of the markup, after manufacturing fees). That raises the question, let's say he made $5k off of the CDs. Would he have made $5k off of Spotify? Or perhaps Spotify would've gotten him twice the fans, who then would've translated to more sales of merch and event tickets?

It's tough to say, but every artist I know that was successful in the 90-00s has to work a lot harder to make money in today's world (ie, more events and such vs back in the day when you could've made money off of the music alone). I think that's where the difference truly lies. People aren't paying for music today, so you have to make the money elsewhere. Whether or not Spotify is helping or hurting is up for debate."
dataisbeautiful,fehw97s,t1_fehpv57,1579125116.0,"I'll give it to you, this is one of the most reasonable explanations I've ever read from folks of your position. Usually people who believe in the ""no ethical consumption"" argument will go as far to say that you should pirate it, and/or not care about your purchase. Which I have gotten into long, hours-long arguments with.

However, your argument here is perfectly reasonable. I just think that consumers should be more prepared to spend their money *more* ethically than they do now."
dataisbeautiful,fehvx0t,t1_fehs9oa,1579124926.0,"Spotify, for most artists, appears to be solely advertising. Essentially, Spotify doesn't get you money, but it gets you fans. Fans that will hopefully buy merch, CDs, or event tickets that the artist gets a better cut from.

I think that's basically how the cookie crumbles. Spotify is an advertising tool for artists, where as CDs are part of merch now. Basically, CDs are a legitimate piece of revenue where Spotify is just exposure for the artist. And I think that's where the problem lies. Consumers might assume that their Spotify subscription helps the artist but it generally doesn't."
dataisbeautiful,feht3rb,t1_fehp8yc,1579123333.0,"1. This is only true for large, big name labels. There are countless small/midsize record labels that are much, much more fair with distributing revenue. I can think of several off the top of my head.

2. Record labels also have staff that need to be paid. It's not just 1 guy behind a desk. There's engineers, web developers, marketing staff, the people who work at the disc manufacturing plant that make the CDs. The idea of the rich record label exec is only true for big name labels.

Overall, what you say is true for the blockbuster big name artists and labels, but generally not the case with smaller ones.

Anyway, at the end of the day, CDs, downloads, and merch will always net more than a stream.

I imagine most artists just use Spotify for publicity more than revenue."
dataisbeautiful,fehjkg4,t1_fehikcv,1579117853.0,"Lol. Same here, but just for reference."
dataisbeautiful,fehj6s0,t1_fehh0q8,1579117629.0,"Paying for Spotify is essentially just paying for the ads to go away. Artists generally don't get more than half a penny per play, often even less than that if they're sharing revenue with a label. The same is true for Amazon Prime video. A friend of mine had his independent film on there (Watch for free with a paid subscription) and he said he doesn't even remember ever getting a check. Almost all of his revenue comes from selling DVDs and real world screenings. The same is true for music."
dataisbeautiful,feh5b7e,t1_fegntq8,1579109446.0,"Honestly, this is a brilliant strategy. Streaming nets an insultingly tiny fraction of the money that full album sales do. This basically says ""Hey, are you a dedicated fan and like supporting my work? Then you'll need to buy the album the old fashion way. Not a huge fan or can't afford to pay full price? No worries, the album will be available for free on streaming in 6 months."" Some people might not like it, but it entices people to be more thoughtful about supporting their favorite artist, rather than getting a plethora of content all for free.

It frustrates me that the average consumer will just say ""Oh Adele has a new album? Let me get it for free"" - it gets the consumer into the mindset that they deserve to get someone else's work without paying."
todayilearned,fdpln78,t1_fdpdqxi,1578632089.0,"Not for everyone. When I went on a group trip overseas, we were all advised to take pepto bismol tablets before and in between meals. All it did was give us terrifying black diarrhea. It won't stop food poisoning but it might help."
canada,fdo9rgg,t1_fdls6t7,1578601339.0,"Thank you for these links. It looks like both Warren and Sanders have clarified their positions. A few months ago (when I first heard about this) their websites didn't mention specifics, only that they wanted to increase the exit tax and step up enforcement (including expats). Looks like they've fleshed out the details, and all this seems pretty reasonable now."
canada,fd43zrb,t1_fcz5unz,1578164206.0,"That is simply one provision of the law. The supreme court decision established that obscene content should be treated equally without any particular type of obscenity deemed worse than the other. This allowed some flexibility for Little Sisters since the CBSA couldn't overpolice LGBT content, but could still seize it as long as the decision wasn't biased."
