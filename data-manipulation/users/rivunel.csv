EDH,ffmy5ci,t3_eu6wfv,1580060125.0,You dont? You make everyone at the table hate life until they kill you so they can get back to playing normal magic
EDH,ffhjghj,t3_etm4fr,1579938036.0,"In my experience the morophon God deck is either a play every God damn God in your deck in a couple turns or a do nothing deck.

I either get a couple enchantress can draw way too many cards and play all the gods. Or my enchantress's cant stick on board I cant get my devotion i need anddd i do nothing and lose."

YouShouldKnow,ffbyhoz,t1_ffbxb7i,1579786793.0,"Ah refreshing, back to no substance attacks that's more like it.

Literally typed the sentence after it may have just been because I'm a math centric person I like math. I'm willing to admit that I could be wrong. 

But judging from your comment history you are willing to keep this going a lot longer than me so good day. Enjoy Digimon tis a decent anime."
YouShouldKnow,ffbu5aj,t1_ffbs700,1579782830.0,"I dont believe home economics is something that should be required thise are things that you will come across in your every day life yes but these are also things that school has given you tools to teach yourself about very easily. Basic algebra SHOULD be more than enough for anyone to balance out a simple budget add up your or weekly income subtract your known expenses constant expenses like bills. Keep money aside for unknown but constants like food. Idk all this stuff was stuff I figured out on my own when I was in 5th grade. 

It really might just be because I'm such a math centric individual and i should judge others by that. But i honestly believe school should give individuals the ability to teach themselves. You dont know everyone's experience teaching to every individuals needs is much harder and less efficient than giving every individual the tools to teach themselves."
YouShouldKnow,ffbnp38,t1_ffa8q4p,1579774549.0,School gives you the tools to teach yourself. the reason they dont teach you how to do taxes in school is because its explained on the fucking papers you get to do your taxes. If you want to learn about taxes the tools are out there most individuals would just rather be spoon fed information than put a modicum of effort into life.

pcmasterrace,ff4fdhc,t1_ff38g5j,1579562283.0,"I suspect something like this. They do make weird mistakes sometimes though. A couple years ago I bought my daughter an outdoor ride on toy for her birthday something happened and it didnt make it on time. They also somehow charged me full price instead of the discounted one.

 A couple calls and a month later I had 3 delivered to my house on the same day and I ended up paying half of the price of one.i assume the delivery guy thought we were starting a little kids race track at our house."
