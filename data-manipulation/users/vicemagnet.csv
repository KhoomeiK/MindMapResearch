lincoln,fg8c5a9,t1_fg8bma4,1580615221.0,Then why did the city choose to install stoplights at 33rd and Yankee Hill instead of a circle?
lincoln,fg8c0pz,t1_fg8akad,1580615121.0,"Not in that stretch of road it doesn’t. Look closely at the intersections. Two of the circles serve zero purpose other than to slow traffic. A third has a tiny offshoot to Dunrovin. When development in this area is further along, it still doesn’t justify these intersections. Look at Pine Lake and Beaver Creek, or Tipperary Trail and Old Cheney for similar intersections without traffic circles. 

Better placement of the circles, such as 56th and Yankee Hill, or a properly designed one at Warlick (not the double decker monstrosity the city wants) would be a better use of our funds. This stretch of Yankee Hill looks almost vindictive in how it was laid out and constructed. 

I could see a rotary installed at the 40th and South and Normal intersection if the bank was removed. 

To be clear, I’m not against circles but the implementation in the case I shared seems wasteful to me. We could have applied the funds elsewhere."
