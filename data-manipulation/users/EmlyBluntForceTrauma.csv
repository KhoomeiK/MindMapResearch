AmItheAsshole,fexbq0g,t1_fewggo8,1579428250.0,"Do you really need science to show that cats are a different species than dogs?

Edit: Okay so ""species"" is a scientific term, so you need science to classify it. But otherwise the emotional impact that I think you're claiming has no footing. I have not cried for a dog. I've cried for stray cats. You and I, we are different. But your perspective does not ring universally true just because you in particular think it to be so. Nor does mine. ^(So it is, to be human.)"
AmItheAsshole,few7hry,t1_fevu4gu,1579406434.0,"...Okay but no one cares that **you're** an AH. The question is whether or not OP, an affluent owner of cats, should have sought out the offered reward. Not whether or not you personally like cats.

If you want to get personal, I've been attacked by **two** dogs, so I'm not a big fan (both times I was approached cold turkey, no previous interaction and I grew up with dogs so I know not to stare them in the eyes blah blah blah) but I'd still call a ""lost dog"" poster despite my overwhelming preference for kitty cats. But I dunno I guess I try not to be an elitist pet AH who decides one pet means more to one person than another so maybe I'm the fuckin' AH"

AmItheAsshole,febtl2h,t1_febg56k,1578962570.0,"I've only had this happen to me once, at my very first job. I was the only employee on a nine hour shift, and the owner had this rule where even being alone, I couldn't eat if anyone was in the store; people had been in so much that day I couldn't get lunch and my knees were shaking by the end of it. Counted till 3 times but kept messing up math because, no food. $20 off. I was opening in the morning and I could have come in early to resume counting (it was all done by hand anyway, absolutely no computer system), but instead I just paid him the $20 so I could go home and eat food for the first time in 10hrs.

Meanwhile, he sold pot and coke paraphernalia out of the back of his other shop. That dude sucked.

Edit: To be clear, by ""I could have come in early"" I mean that I offered to do so, but he refused. So I just paid him to go home."
