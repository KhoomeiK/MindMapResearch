The PvE is great. 

There are definitely players for PvP still. 

But PvP is broken. Most people use cheats and exploits to get unfair advantages rather than do some cool shit and it will never get fixed. The hit reg is broken as well. It's not a bug it's a feature, apparently, and it won't get fixed either. Nevertheless you can get at least 200-300h of entertainment before you're sick of cheaters. 

I think that's enough bang for your buck, because we both love PvP and while I loathe the hackers that turned me off the game I don't regret buying it."
