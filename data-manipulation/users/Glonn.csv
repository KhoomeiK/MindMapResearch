news,fenlfco,t1_fenjsw8,1579287197.0,"I work at one.

We get lacerations, dog bites, burns, allergic reactions all the way up to anaphylaxis, people having strokes, and heart attacks.

People come to the urgent care because they want to be told they aren't having what they are afraid of, it's a fight to get them to go to the ER sometimes."

todayilearned,fdrx4eq,t1_fdrojy1,1578691036.0,"I've had to yell for help once and I think that was the loudest I've ever been.

Never saw anyone come running as fast, my patient passed out and vomited while sitting up and I was holding her up with one hand while leaning around the corner screaming"

Eventually the situation does become normal and you react calm due to being used to it, but patients feed on our demeanor.

If a doctor is nervous, the patient will be. We need the patient and entire staff to be calm as to not exacerbate the problem by worrying the patient.


As a student during hospital codes I was always nervous and put myself out of the way to observe and learn. Same with surgery although that's a bit more calm"
todayilearned,fdr5egv,t1_fdr4wv0,1578679706.0,"It is a learned behavioral trait.

Initially I was useless and nervous and froze up in emergencies, now working 5 years I respond instantly"
todayilearned,fdr54lw,t1_fdqzi3c,1578679666.0,"Yes there are. There's trauma team, code teams, and the entire logistics of a hospital situation require people to do that.

Doctors are assigned to a few rooms,nurses are given individual rooms and are supervised by a lead nurse."
todayilearned,fdqxvcb,t1_fdqw5q0,1578676405.0,"I work urgent care with doctors. The most I've seen them get worked up is when they yell ""I need help"" loudly and clearly so we all can respond.

They stay calm because the patients go off of how they're acting. If the doctor is freaking out, the patient will too"
