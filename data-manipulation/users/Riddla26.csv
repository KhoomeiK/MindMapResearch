Now think about how smart you have to be to work at Facebook vs how smart you have to be to become a police officer (no offence policemen in the thread) and compare how likely it is that it will be abused for non-police related things?

Having it started is a prerequisite for the rest of the startup scripts to continue running in the background which is likely why you can't get to things like task manager as you might not have a fully interactive user session initialised at this point.

Sorry I'm late to the party, just wanted to give a little background on the behaviour, unfortunately the only fix likely to work is a system restore given how resistant Windows 10 is to that kind of meddling. It could just be a misfiring script you could fix by booting into safe mode with networking and running ""DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth"". But this will undo some custom settings so be sure to go make sure your privacy settings are all set up properly if it works.

AndroidWear,ffbwnqk,t3_esrvql,1579785215.0,"You're looking for a standalone smartwatch and don't have a smartphone but aren't even on board with streaming music?

That seems counterintuitive, and tbh the technology is still a couple of years away from the kind fully capable product you're looking for. You're not likely to find the full feature set you want and the battery will barely last a day or two in most watches even without heavy usage. The Zeblaze claims an 800mAh battery but whether that translates to longer life is up to the power drain, and a 4G radio drains a lot.

I would also drop a small warning about the custom ROM's loaded onto smartwatches. This watch is running a custom Android 7.1, rather than the proper Android Wear, which means you're at the mercy of the manufacturer in terms of preloaded apps, dial-home functions and data collection. To my knowledge nobody has really dug into many of the ROM's loaded onto smaller manufacturer smartwatches yet, so it's a bit of a gamble.

There's nothing wrong with streaming services, though I had the same misgivings at first. You simply build the playlists online in a browser instead of on your device, with the bonus that they're available on any other devices you use. With Google Play Music commonly streamed music is downloaded to your device for offline play, but as long as you have any kind of data signal on your phone it works flawlessly.

I understand coming from a particular era, I grew up as all this was completely new, I still have stacks of burned CD's for the car stereo that never come out of the glovebox, but there are a lot of advantages to the new ways.

I'm not on board with Spotify because to a certain extent you can't choose exactly what to listen to (it's mostly genre and radio station based and you can only skip a certain number of songs with a free account), but with Play Music you can treat it as your own music library, for about £7 a month you get access to their whole library of hundreds of thousands of songs, I've hardly ever gone looking for something on there and not found it even with niche music.

Chances are the Zeblaze requires you to have a subscription to a compatible streaming service that it has a watch app for in order to sync your music, it will also likely be able to play local music via built in functionality, but I would be wary of the amount of usable space in that 16Gb storage once the OS and apps take up part of it you may end up with less than you anticipated."

In general and usually at minimum, a desktop computer is:

* A Motherboard to plug the rest of the bits into
* A PSU (Power Supply Unit) to power it
* A CPU (Central Processing Unit)
* A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
* Some RAM (Random Access Memory)
* A disk for storage (SSD preferable, HDD slower but cheaper)
* A case to put it all in

There are all kinds of combinations of parts, luckily there are a lot of tools and resources that can help you figure out what you'll have to spend to get where you want to go for performance. It's perfectly possible to put together a great gaming PC that will play lots of modern titles on a modest budget these days. If you want to get a better sense of what that might be like take a look at https://pcpartpicker.com/

[Here's a comparision of the onboard Intel HD Graphics 2500 and the RX 580](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-HD-2500-Desktop-105-GHz-vs-AMD-RX-580/m7696vs3923) based on the results of thousands of benchmarks run by other PC builders. The RX 580 is effectively 4,600% faster, not exaggerating!

Honestly the rest of the PC in that workstation is competent for number crunching but it's not really a gaming machine, it's CPU may alreadystruggle and hold the RX 580 back and I'm not sure without looking up the model numbers whether it will even take a full size graphics card.

Having a dedicated card to render 3D applications allows it to work in tandem with the CPU, providing 3D rendered frames at the split second they're needed, as many times a second (frames per second, or fps, is the most common performance benchmark) as possible instead of splitting limited resources to one task.

[Here is a comparison](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-RTX-2080-Ti-vs-AMD-RX-580/4027vs3923) between the AMD Radeon RX 580 and the current ""cream of the crop"" the NVidia RTX 2080 Ti. Not a confusing naming system at all right! Of course the 2080 Ti is twice as good, but for ten times the price of the RX 580.

Pairing hardware of a similar generation will help you get the most out of them. Think of it like you're intentionally buying a console that's a couple of years old, maybe an i5-6xxx or 7xxx series CPU would pair better with the RX 580 now their prices are dropping due to the 8xxx and 9xxx series, but you'll want to get a motherboard with a socket and architecture that supports it, matching RAM, stock GPU cooling is usually OK but you'll want a proper CPU cooler, and so on.

If you want to learn a bit more about it all I'd recommend taking a look around /r/buildapc, and /r/buildapcforme if you just want to throw out a budget and let some people try to come up with options for you."

It has maybe 10% of the grunt of any actual graphics card you'd care to name and it will not even run most 3D applications and those that do run won't be anywhere near 60fps at any resolution.

CanIRunIt,fezaxsd,t3_eqk8ly,1579455506.0,"Well, it's missing the key component of a gaming machine, a dedicated graphics card.

With a setup like this you could get fairly decent performance on a 1080p monitor by adding something like a Radeon RX 580 - if it has a PCI-E slot and can take a full size graphics card. It's one of the better price/performance cards for mid-range machines.

This depends on several factors, space inside the case, PCI-E slot availability on the motherboard and 2x free 6-pin power adaptors on the power supply, as most modern cards require both connectors attached.

Apparently Ark is particularly unoptimised, so I wouldn't expect amazing performance from it in any case, but this machine could conceivably give it a shot, though that CPU may be slightly too old to give acceptable grunt even with a GPU."

The EDL, football hooligans, local ""gangs"" and all that lot? Why do you seem to be trying to rationalise the view that anyone that isn't white is clearly a criminal? Like it's ""in their makeup"" which is another horseshit term racists use to justify tarring a whole ethnicity with the same brush, by the way, just like the ""duck"" analogy.

The problem is crime. It doesn't matter what colour the people committing it are.

Maybe if we didn't shove minorities in their own little pockets of the country and treat them like garbage, with suspicion and condescension, being treated like 2nd class citizens only being considered for the worst paying jobs and having to put up with badly educated white people shouting racial slurs at them thinking it's somehow their god given right, we wouldn't be driving members of these communities to commit violent crimes and even with all this, you know that an OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of ALL CRIMES are still committed by white British in this country, right?

Think about where you got that view from. What paper did you read it in? What kind of old white milliionaire owns it? Why don't you think there's headlines of the horrendous shit white people do on a literally daily basis? Maybe there's another reason you only hear about minority crimes in the media.

It is racist to single out entire communities and label them as ""troublemakers"" for any of their members committing a crime. How would you feel if the government said they were getting rid of all white people because someone you don't know and never met committed a crime? Rightfully offended right?

I bet you'd be really offended. But that's exactly the same comparison you've just drawn about entire communities of people living peacefully in the UK, just trying to make ends meet like everyone else.

You say ""stating the obvious"", but what you mean is ""leap to simple minded conclusions about entire populations in efforts to demonise and criminalise them"".

That handful of rich white people who own the media in this country have done more to destabilise society and encourage criminality than any amount of immigration ever has.

Vive,fe7qmrf,t3_eo2wne,1578918039.0,"The mistake you're making is equating VR hardware to absolutely anything else on the tech market.

These things have not been around very long for a start, your wireless adaptor sits directly between your headset and your PC and for all intents and purposes your headset is COMPLETELY UNAWARE that it's wireless.

You've bought 1st gen add-on hardware and stuck it on a 2nd gen headset from a company that has basically lost it's shit. The only reason they manufactured the OG Vive was because Valve designed and developed it and everything from them since then has been a massive waste of money.

You haven't done your research (every review of the Cosmos pans it almost unilaterally as not good enough for the asking price) and there's usability issues and now you're here bitching at the whole community like you deserve a perfect wireless VR experience with hours and hours of life that isn't a fucking backpack sized battery despite the fact **NO SUCH THING FUCKING EXISTS.**

The fact you can't charge and use it at the same time is also the fault of HTC, the wireless adaptor is just an Intel WiGig module in a fancy plastic case. It receives the signal from the PC and passes it to the headset as if it were cabled in. That's it.

The Quest is a mobile phone in a fancy display case. It's also absolutely designed to sucker people in who don't want to commit to a full VR experience and they suffer all the limitations that come along with it, as well as having terrible tracking issues. Most other HMD's, Vive included, do not have any on board computing capability, so everything must be transmitted to it from a PC, making wireless a much trickier prospect to perfect.

I came into the thread wanting to help out and make any issues a bit easier for you but considering your shitty attitude and the generally abusive nature of your comments towards everyone else I'll simply say you're a dumbass who should have saved your money and got an Index.

Also try removing other USB peripherals and see if the problem decreases or stops.

It would also be helpful to identify where the stutter is coming from. Crack open Task Manager and on the processes tab find the ""System interrupts"" process and watch what it does when you move the headset. If the numbers there spike then it's likely USB related."

Shenmue,fe3okyk,t3_enpdmm,1578851371.0,"At this point the series has to end properly via games. It just has to, a whole generation has waited 15 years so far to see where it goes next. Suzuki has said that they would need to make up to Shenmue 5 to properly wrap up the story, so even Shenmue 4 wouldn't be enough.

IMO, the story HAS to center on the dragon and phoenix mirrors eventually with the family rivalry as a side note. The legend tells they are the key to reviving the Qing Dynasty (one of only two times when China was not ruled by the Han people and the last dynasty before the Republic of China was founded, it was a multicultural empire that lasted more than 300 years and initially brought great prosperity to China) and they have been the overall driving force throughout the games, even with the revenge plot aside, the mirrors are the true mystery of Shenmue.

From the wiki:
>Master Chen noted that Yuanda Zhu once told him, ""When the Dragon and the Phoenix meet, the gates of heaven and earth will open, and Chi You (a world-devouring monster from Chinese folklore) will resurrect itself on earth."" It is unclear if this is in reference to a literal monster or a metaphor for something else, and even Master Chen admits that he does not know the full extent of Lan Di's plans. 

>Zhu explains that when the two mirrors are brought together they form a key to treasures ""hidden away in order to revive the Qing Dynasty"".

There's also speculation that Iwao accidentally murdered Sunming Zhao (they were friends, Sunming is Lan Di's father) which is what drove Lan Di to kill Iwao, so it may already be an eye for an eye revenge situation.

I think Ryo will be the one to find the treasure (likely something of either massively important cultural heritage or ancient mystical power over men, given the already mystical treatment of kung fu practises throughout the games forming a theme) and Lan Di will interrupt in the temple/burial place/wherever it's hidden. After a long and brutal fight in which both are injured, they, exhausted, talk about their respective fathers and realise they both have the same aims and agree to resolve their differences, in order to finally stop the killing.

Or, Ryo finally dispatches Lan Di as he is too blinded by his hatred to see sense and uses the treasure of the caves to become a living legend among kung fu practitioners, travelling the continent, righting wrongs and defending innocent people."

All products experience failures and the important thing is the support you get when you have one, is it replaced fast, does the replacement work, etc.

The relatively high failure rate with the initial batches of Index are likely linked to rushed production and non-uniformity of part availability, just like it was with the OG Vive. I even had to have my Vive replaced due to dead pixels in the panels because they were under such demand that they couldn't source only A+ grade panels to use in them on release. I imagine Valve are in the same position x100 given how much demand for the Index has skyrocketed.

If you want one, buy one, enjoy VR. If not, just give up trying to convince everyone it's a ""failed"" product.

But he did and we read it and it's all brilliant, an amazing legacy to leave behind. To teach the world to look at itself slightly askew, to take the time to realise the absurdity in a lot of our own behaviours and gently encourage us all to become better, more caring, more attentive people.
