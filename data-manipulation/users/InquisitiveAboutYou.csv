I think we would have to argue first what he means by god. I'm confident in saying that in no way does this take the existence of a god as adhered to by, let's say, abrahamistic theists nowadays. 

Mathematical consistencies could exist simply from nature. Nature could just be logic by its foundation, there's no reason to assume this requires an entity for which there is no explanation to begin with.

> mathematics, the material world and human consciousness. As Penrose acknowledged, it was a complete puzzle to him how the three interacted with one another outside the ability of any scientific or other conventionally rational model.

I'm also confident in saying this wasn't outside of a scientific or rational model. This model might not have been contemplated yet, but you can very easily connect mathematics and the material world. Human consciousness was still in the early phases of scientific research, and understanding all the complexities took many years, which we still don't btw. Nowadays we know more about consciousness - through neuroscience - and we can see how this fits in with the first two. I would advise to read Robert Sapolsky, an authority on these subjects. 

>How can physical atoms and molecules, for example, create something that exists in a separate domain that has no physical existence: human consciousness?

>It is a mystery that lies beyond science.

Consciousness, meaning being concious, is not a mystery that lies beyond science, it's actually a scientific subject. It simply means to exist. If you do not exist you have no consciousness. This is called 'god of the gaps'. ""we don't fully understand how the human brain produces thought, therefore god"". This is not an explanation in the least. 

>As I would say, mathematics is operating in a god-like fashion.

Jumping on the bandwagon, it does not mean that. 

>In the Axial Age (commonly dated from 800 to 200 B.C.), world-transforming ideas such as Buddhism, Confucianism, the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle, and the Hebrew Old Testament almost miraculously appeared at about the same time in India, China, ancient Greece and among the Jews in the Middle East, groups having little interaction with one another.

We only know about them through the discovery of writing, before these philosophies, and philosophers, there were others that we don't know about because it wasn't written down as extensively, or destroyed in the meantime. These groups had a lot of interaction with eachother, read the book 1177 B.C. 

> that all these astonishing things happened within the conscious workings of human minds, functioning outside physical reality, offers further rational evidence, in my view, for the conclusion that human beings may well be made “in the image of [a] God.”

This is not rational, this is jumping to conclusions by misinterpreting evidence and not understanding history. 

>Even though Karl Marx, for example, condemned the illusion of religion, his followers, ironically, worshiped Marxism.

No one worshiped Marx himself. This is an empty point. 

To be clear. Our consciousness and thoughts are not non-physical. They exist in our brain. If you stick electrodes in the brain you can see the parts of the brain lighting up responsible for the task you are performing whether it is remembering, doing calculus, feeling happy. This is physically happening and can be measured and induced/destroyed.

>Robert H. Nelson Professor of Public Policy, University of Maryland

In my opinion it's a lot of name dropping without binding these people together. It seems to me af if he wants to give his opinion merit just by saying other scientists names, but none of them argue his point, most of them argue the opposite. For a professor this is not a good write up, it's a weak assumption on the basis of misunderstanding evidence and history, leading to a false conclusion."
DebateReligion,fgwks0a,t1_fgw6ihm,1581162354.0,">But it is not possible that you continue to think but cease to exist after your body is suddenly destroyed since ""I am thinking"" entails ""I exist."" Therefore it is conceivable (it is logically possible) that you are a substance that can continue to exist after its body is destroyed.

How do you come to the conclusion that this logically possible? We think with our brain. The brain is part of the body. If the body is destroyed the brain is destroyed. Therefore either we think with something else than our brain, which we do not know-, and do not have evidence of, or when the body is destroyed our capacity for thinking is destroyed. I wonder how you believe thinking is done?"
Documentaries,fgwfkn7,t1_fgv7qxm,1581160614.0,"Well, in regards to your example, this happened to me last week. Me and 2 other friends decided to meet at friend 3's house for a jamming session, because this friend has all the equipment in her house. Last minute the house wasn't available. It was a 1,5 hour travel for me and I was already on the bus. So I called friend 1 who came by car, he said he was going to visit his grandma if the jamming wasn't happening. I called friend 2 who was in his city waiting for the bus, about to get on, I told him stay there, I took another bus to his city. We went to a music store and jammed with the owner and went for dinner after. We had a great day. If this friend would have cancelled I would've still gone and Jam with the owner myself. 

If things don't go like you expect, change the plan. Want to go out to dinner with a friend but the friends cancels? Go alone. Get to meet the staff in the restaurant, or invite a random stranger to join you.

It's only about you having a good time, and if a friend isn't there to enjoy that good time together with you, change the plans, go alone, call another friend, go to see a movie, treat yourself for ice cream. If you can learn to recognise when you're wasting your time with either someone or something, you can learn to change it. If you recognise you're not happy about doing something (or someone for that matter), change it. First you need to be comfortable with who you are, and after that you can go out and make other people feel comfortable too. And being comfortable with who you are has little to do with what you look like or how rich you are. It's about understanding who you are, accepting who you are and then doing things that you love to do, and that make you happy."
Documentaries,fgwc2dd,t1_fgui3lp,1581159383.0,"I have this problem too, to an extent. I'm someone who loves arguing, and I have a very strong sense of right and wrong, or injustice. Since Taoism I haven't stopped debating, I've changed the settings in which I debate. I never debate from anger, if I feel angry I walk away. I never debate from ignorance, if I don't know something I stay quiet and listen. And I never debate from authority, in the sense ""you have to listen to me because I know things you don't"".

I debate in a conversational form, almost Socratic, one on one, and only with people who want to learn and are rational. Debating for me is 75% listening, and I'm always very interested to find out how other people come to their conclusions. This leads me to mostly debate how they get their information, how they rationalise and internalise this information, and how they come to their conclusions. I honestly think everyone would come to the same conclusions I do if they follow the same process.

I adhere to a quote from Robert Sapolsky, which I'll have to paraphrase, ""gossip is for the weak"". I honestly think you only gossip when you don't feel strong, it's a way of getting a (false) sense of power.

This is dishonesty.

Being skeptical alone isn't enough, you need to be educated in the subjects you're skeptical about. A lot of people are skeptical of vaccines, I can tell you with an almost 100% certainty that none of these people are educated in vaccines. This falls in the category of being skeptical to either appease your toxic surrounding, or as a pushback against 'the enemy', which is what the anti-vax movement is.

You can keep saying your goal is to be skeptical, but as pointed out by me and others, you're not educated enough in these subjects to truelly be skeptical. You appear to just want to be against 'the enemy' rather than using intellectual honesty to come to a truth.

Apparently that isn't true, judging by your reaction to it. But even if it were, the reason it loses is value is because people normalise it, like you're now doing. Why do certain groups try to normalise it? I'm thinking because they know they're racists, but don't like the negative label this word brings, so a faction become so extremely racist that moderate racism almost seems benign, it's still racist though. 

>America is one of the LEAST racist countries in the entire world:

The US is so tolerant because the majority of your country is liberal, judging by the fact that liberal politicians practically always win the popular vote. The problem is that the people we're talking about have a lot of the power in politics, so even though the country might not be racist, the politicians are, especially the ones in power.

Sometimes when an answer is that simple it means you haven't understood the question. When someone says people can come to their own conclusions that means you don't have to give them the facts and they'll still figure it out on their own. Take a person who's never practised judo, within minutes they will be executing this principle, if you then ask them to explain it they don't need help to understand this principle. I don't believe you were every a judo teacher btw, that's where my lying accusation came from. This point only shows that you have a very low tolerance for things that you think are hard to define because this just isn't one of them.

You literally said it. Being wrong is okay, but pretending you didn't make a mistake when it is in writing is so extremely religious of you. 

>The Nicene Creed or the Apostles Creed

First, most Christians have no idea what these are, again showing you're just lying for effect.

Second, this doesn't say anything about what you believe, just what you recant. Do you believe in evolution? or free will? or individuality? Which laws have priority, secular or religious? Again, if you think the answer is that simple you haven't understood the question.

>I claimed no such thing. It just takes longer to learn what Christians believe than atheists. 

That's only true for atheists who were not raised religiously, atheists that were raised religiously, by necessity, have a lot more knowledge on these subjects than the average religious person, not including the extensive knowledge in subjects religious people shun. I read you dismiss them as picking simple objections and `becoming atheists`, I would argue religion never fully indoctrinated them, so 'becoming atheist' is a banality. There are enough studies showing atheists know more about religion than the religious, which Christians scoring horribly.
