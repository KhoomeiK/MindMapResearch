nba,ff55irn,t1_ff52j3b,1579580819.0,Harden is transcendentally efficient at his usage though.
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff3y5q1,t1_ff3ikj8,1579551413.0,"That quarter of billion dollars seems extremely unrealistic, and I can't find any credible sources to confirm it on Google."
nba,fev2lxc,t1_fetxu66,1579392426.0,"LeBron clearly making his players worse     /s

...but this is still a dumb take (unless he's chucking so much at an inefficient rate)."
nba,fev2i87,t1_feu3hrr,1579392378.0,"He showed flashes during his rookie year, but he's looked pretty limited this year imo"
nba,fev28f8,t1_feudl3g,1579392253.0,"I'm guessing Butler's playoff career stats look worse since he took several year of development before becoming a star. He was the best Sixer in the playoffs last year imo, and his previous Bulls/Minnesota playoff teams were nothing to write home about. 

I've never heard people say he was a dominant playoff performer, but I have no reason to expect him not to perform at a high level with Miami in the playoffs this year."
nba,fetx0zd,t1_fetkj0r,1579380925.0,The Bears are like if the Mavs traded up to get Mo Bamba lol

nba,feixqxh,t1_feiwvbl,1579150143.0,"It’s absolutely not that certain. Honestly I’d say it’s closer to 50/50

Edit: I agree with y’all it’s lower than 50/50. I just typically get downvoted by Jokic stans if I ever suggest he isn’t the second coming"
nba,feh6tnz,t1_feh54pv,1579110356.0,"I’ve never seen someone call him a scrub, He’s just not worth that contract."

nba,fefyhff,t1_fefy7t1,1579069502.0,"Maybe but it’s hard for me to see them picking Mitchell over Westbrook, largely due to legacy/reputation"
nba,fefybu9,t1_fefx04n,1579069337.0,You’re saying he was better than Curry in 2016? Also hard to say best player since ‘16 when he basically didn’t play one of the 4 years since
