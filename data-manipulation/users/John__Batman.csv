insanepeoplefacebook,fgua7ne,t1_fgt824z,1581115962.0,"That was my thought as well. A CPS report was made. I feel bad for the kid, I still did not want him anywhere near my kid and saying those things."
nextfuckinglevel,fgu9zqg,t1_fgsjrrc,1581115818.0,"I have 2 dogs like this. First dog we got after he had been rehomed 3 times for escaping yards. He's mostly an indoor dog now and he's loving that, he's mostly a lazy couch potato. But if he gets out the front door he runs laps around the neighborhood as fast as he can(he doesn't want to play in the backyard though, go figure). Second dog is a 10 month old mastiff mix. Mastiff/malinois possibly given her coloring and behavior. She's nuts. Destructive as hell and DETERMINED to escape. Does not want to stay in the house for any length of time. We've had to repair our 6ft gate twice in the last few months because she chews through it. All the patio screen windows and doors have been reinforced with metal or thick wood lattice. Today she broke through the lattice over the windows. She gets walked every day, often twice a day, for an hour plus. She gets plenty of outside play time with us and the kids. She has had so many toys and bones and things to keep her occupied(constantly being replaced becauseshe destroys them in minutes). She has had basic obedience and is very smart and well behaved when given instructions. She still is wreaking havoc on our yard and running amok if left unsupervised for any amount of time."
insanepeoplefacebook,fgu6ai7,t1_fgtu0sd,1581113913.0,"God, a few years ago I had to stop a very large 3rd grader from strangling a tiny, malnourished kindergartener who had downs syndrome. The 3rd grader was about 130 pounds, kindergartener was like 30 something pounds. Little guy was terrified. Hell, I was terrified. The kid outweighed me by a good 20 pounds and if other staff hadn't been there he probably would have hurt me pretty bad."
insanepeoplefacebook,fgu5l9u,t1_fgtkisw,1581113718.0,He said he was going to break into our home and hurt her and make her touch her brother.
insaneparents,fgtfr78,t1_fgtagrc,1581103905.0,"New York has an excellent education system from what I've heard. I'm jealous. I was in California, which is still pretty decent education wise. But I guess our district just fell flat with language and elective type classes for the most part, and our town had mostly white and Hmong people. I'm in Florida now and...hate absolutely everything about the schools(as a parent). Tip to anyone reading, if you have a kid who needs any sort of special services or accommodations, stay far away from Florida."
insanepeoplefacebook,fgtesc8,t1_fgtaoz8,1581103548.0,"I didn't argue otherwise. But there's a difference between a toddler who has not yet developed empathy and needing to be taught, and a 5 or 6 year old who is threatening to sexually assault or murder a classmate. Sure, they were made to be that way. Someone fucked up there. But it's not a simple case of not yet having empathy like it is with little kids who don't know better."
insanepeoplefacebook,fgt70tg,t1_fgt047n,1581100372.0,"In the boy's case it sounded as if he had been abused himself, CPS report was made. The stuff he said was bad, not just ""I saw porn accidentally"" type stuff. He told my daughter he was going to break into our home and sexually assault her and ""make her touch her brother"". This kid was 5."
insanepeoplefacebook,fgt6vyx,t1_fgt01mu,1581100291.0,There's a difference between not having much empathy yet and literally threatening to murder people for no reason.
insaneparents,fgsqz77,t1_fgqthf6,1581090787.0,"The way american public schools teach, you likely wouldn't really learn it anyway. I took French in high school, my husband took Spanish. I don't remember more than a few phrases in French and he's the same with Spanish. Complete waste of time."
insanepeoplefacebook,fgspr1b,t1_fgsipvb,1581090021.0,"Im convinced that most of the children at my kids' school are little fucking psychopaths. A girl in my daughter's first grade class told my daughter she wants to kill her and everyone else in the class. So we got to have a meeting about that yesterday. And last year a boy told her some horrible sexual things(not birds and bees, abusive vulgar shit that scared the crap out of her). Those incidents plus all the other things I hear from her and from my mother who works there, sounds like the kids are all feral."

AmItheAsshole,fgp02b3,t1_fgo682n,1580993236.0,I asked my husband to do this once. He fucked it up horribly. The day before I started a new job.
AmItheAsshole,fgozu89,t1_fgoi8en,1580993099.0,"As a daycare provider, the kids usually know that it's my job and I get money to watch them. My son is almost 5. He's never been in daycare but he's been in therapy since 18 months until recently. He went through about 4 or 5 therapists. Each time we were able to explain that the person was leaving for a new job or that he had aged out of that program."
AmItheAsshole,fgozj6g,t1_fgnveaa,1580992889.0,"""She has a new job. She works at the preschool but she's not our nanny anymore"". That's it. That's how you explain it."
AmItheAsshole,fgoz8jr,t1_fgot7vc,1580992608.0,"I had my anatomy scans at 17, 19, 21 weeks with each baby. It just depends on when you book the appointment but it can happen generally any time after 15 weeks. And they always typed ""it's a [sex]"" on one image."
AmItheAsshole,fgoyupg,t1_fgoueve,1580992226.0,"You can find out any time after about 15ish weeks. It all depends on when you book the appointment. I've found out at 17, 19, 21 weeks with my babies."
teenagers,fgodhbh,t1_fgobfdb,1580966402.0,"I've worked in special ed/gen. ed for years, my husband has worked in special ed for years, my mom has worked special ed and now works gen ed. She was the one specifically told that the officer would help with ""problem students"". In the state I worked in previously I had severe kids arrested/detained  by officers. I'm now a parent of a kid who would be a ""problem child"" at only 4.5 years old.  Kids with those same behaviors would be at risk of being hurt if they were a fraction older than my son."
AskReddit,fgocguc,t1_fgo947j,1580965536.0,It's a learning process for sure. Yelling sucks but shit happens. Lol.
AskReddit,fgo5iwf,t1_fgnx2dh,1580960283.0,"I appreciate that. I feel like I end up yelling too much, if only because the total volume in the house is impossible to speak over when I need to. My kids all have sensory issues(at least). With 3 overactive, hyperactive, noise sensitive, kids, plus myself....shit gets crazy. I don't like yelling. They don't like yelling. But when nobody is listening, we all eventually resort to yelling under the right circumstances."
teenagers,fgnujuq,t1_fgnn9jf,1580953216.0,"Staff at my kids' ELEMENTARY SCHOOL were lowkey told that the officer would be there to help them deal with ""problem kids"" as needed. Yeah, I'm not too fucking thrilled with that. You know what ""problem kids"" usually means? Special ed kids. You know what cops aren't fucking trained to deal with? Special ed kids."
