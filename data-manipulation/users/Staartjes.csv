When I was old enough to do my own research, I came across countless people that had more than enough evidence to proof that their research and stories of certain individuals are true. It’s also the researcher’s name that’s at stake. Dr Weiss had a good reputation as a psychiatrist with a successful practise. He had enormous doubts about writing his first book. Anyway... to each their own. Personally I wish that there was no such thing as reïncarnatie, because I absolutely hate it here and I never want to come back."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fffoakl,t1_fff9kqf,1579888238.0,"Same here. My parents did what they thought was the norm. Work, get married, have kids. But you basically had to raise yourself. Exactly what you said; “ seen, not heard” . Mom did everything and dad couldn’t really be bothered. I was the oldest daughter, so I had to take care of my younger sister. And I really tried hard to be the perfect daughter to get my parents love. Didn’t work though.. and even now after all these years, I’m still the most grownup and respond person in my family, which has me exhausted. Also the black sheep because I dared to leave house with out getting married and live of my own. Still single and definitely not going to mingle. I always wished I was never born, even at a young age. So I’m not going to do that to an other soul. I don’t want to create karma, I don’t want to get reincarnated here again."

hypnosis,fff6vtk,t1_ffefv5c,1579877229.0,Oh I didn’t know about him. Thank you for the tip.
rareinsults,ffeixim,t3_et0mkz,1579849886.0,"I was always cold at the office. When I was fat or skinny, it didn’t matter. Doesn’t matter what time of year it was or how many layers I wore. Highest number of layers were 5. At one company 2 of my colleagues got pneumonia from the ac. I wish it was so simple as to just put on a extra cardigan. Now that I’m on antidepressants, my temperature has shot up! So weird..."
hypnosis,ffefsr9,t3_esxrnm,1579846345.0,That is so awesome! Thank you for sharing. I haven’t really been able to access previous lives. I’ve seen some glimpse when I try the regressions on YouTube.  My favourite therapist is Dr. Brian Weiss. I love his books.

ShitMomGroupsSay,ffe6qoh,t3_esvit9,1579838181.0,"Maybe a mean thing to say, I don’t know, but it sounds like she doesn’t want to spend time with her kids? Childcare is expensive, I don’t know why people don’t do the math before they get a kid."
