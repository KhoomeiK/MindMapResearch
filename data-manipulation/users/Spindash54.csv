KingdomHearts,ffhi3ht,t1_ffhi0za,1579936237.0,"At the Load screen for the save files, press Square instead of X. That will bring you back into the main vanilla game so you can grind. You can jump back to the Data Battles with a normal X on the Load screen.

My main point though is if you already overwrote the Re Mind file with the LimitCut file, you won't get back to Scala without starting a Re Mind scenario over from scratch."
KingdomHearts,ffftuo0,t3_ete2mh,1579891672.0,"Because Re Mind only imports from the main game when you start a new Re Mind file. If you want Oathkeeper (and Oblivion), in Re Mind, you need to have them already unlocked in a Main Game save file."

KHUx,fedkthg,t3_eoevmp,1579014011.0,"The running around with the Keyblade Wielders is the in-game explanation of the “Union Cross” that we do as Multiplayer. The implication being that after the war, we (The Player) has been having missions with these guys to forget the memories of the war.  

Here is an overview of the cutscenes in relation to the war: https://i.imgur.com/smAvkS5.png

There’s some debate if the War comes before or after the first section of Castle of Dreams, but Strelitzia stalking the player in that World lends me to believe she didn’t die (and the war didn’t start) until after Quest 630. In either case, Quest 631 (where we meet the Keyblade Wielders is post-war).

(PS, the dates are the release dates for those Quests in JP and Global, with the number being the number of days waited for that release."

KHUx,fdho1af,t1_fdhhmrw,1578426708.0,"I’m not even talking about the time of day (which isn’t any different from past updates). But the reason this update took so long is because of the holiday season that just passed. Most in IT tend to avoid releasing major updates during the holiday break due to a general lack of staff on-hand due to vacations, etc. In addition, App Stores (Apple specifically that I’m aware of) has a freeze that prevents any updates from going out around Christmas time. 

This whole debacle is just bad care/planning from Japan for putting out their update literally right before the freeze started, leaving us in the cold, for lack of a better term, until the season ended."
KHUx,fdhh3ld,t1_fdhghhy,1578422513.0,"Blame JP, not NA. They’re the ones that wanted to release a major update right before the holidays when a freeze goes into effect for application development. This was literally the earliest week they could distribute it."

KHUx,fcxonok,t1_fcxjb96,1578067887.0,"Probably next week. The update coming to Japan RIGHT before the holidays really screwed us, as it isn’t common to release major updates during a holiday season. Plus the App Stores freeze submission for a period of time too."
