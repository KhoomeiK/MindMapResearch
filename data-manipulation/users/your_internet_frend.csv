Edmonton,ffae8dg,t1_ff9rdsw,1579733551.0,"And that’s why we should have more frequent bus routes in our city. If the bus comes every 5-10 minutes instead of every 30-60, a lot more people will take it."
Edmonton,ff9zo4i,t3_esd7u5,1579724923.0,"I think parking is a really divisive, emotional issue because everyone has a wildly different perspective based on how it’s affected them in their own lives.


I’ve known upper middle class, 30 year old, able bodied people - Person A -  who will say “hmm, I want a Pepsi ”. and start up their car and drive to the convenience store a 5 minute walk from their house in a pleasant safe walkable neighbourhood, on a beautiful 23 degree summer day. 


I’ve also known poverty-level-income people with mobility issues/injuries - Person B - who drive home from their part time minimum wage job at 11:45pm (couldn’t take the bus because their route stops running at 11 and also they can’t walk more than 10 minutes at a time), and are then forced to limp 3 blocks in -30, in the dark on icy and snow covered  sidewalks — because they’re subletting a room in an apartment with only one parking stall (which their landlord called dibs on), and due to snow there’s currently a parking ban on half the streets in their neighbourhood. 


So the anti-parking people, with their mental image of Person A who really obviously did not need their car at all in that scenario, say “people in this city are insane car addicts and it wouldn’t kill them to skip driving once in a while. This is why we have such bad traffic, weirdos who act like walking more than 20 feet will kill them!”


And then the pro-parking people, with their mental image of Person B, who is suffering and possibly going to actually get hurt due to parking restrictions, say “parking is something people literally need, it would be insane to take it away, what the fuck is wrong with you! Are you some kind of sociopath?!”




And then, everyone yells a bunch of one-sided arguments at each other while refusing to listen to the other side or consider things like compromise/nuance. I would know, I’m a transportation engineer/planner who used to specialize in parking issues... you wouldn’t believe some of the psycho shit I’ve heard from BOTH sides of the debate. 



Here’s my perspective: Toronto and Vancouver are both massive Canadian cities with a FUCKTON of traffic and parking issues. If Edmonton keeps growing, and develops the same way Canadian cities have been developing in the past... it WILL have exactly the same problems Toronto and Vancouver have. We are already dealing with a smaller scale version of a lot of their transportation problems! 


So Edmontonians are not actually walking into this blindfolded, like non-planners seem to assume we are. We don’t actually have to shriek “if we allow blah blah or restrict blah blah, who KNOWS what could happen?! Think of the children!!” ... because we literally do know what will happen. We can look at the things existing big cities did right and wrong, and look at the patterns repeated over and over and over in urban planning history, and learn what to do and what to avoid. Why not take a rational, evidence-based approach to studying parking issues? 


So what’s my personal opinion on this stuff? It’s too complicated and long (and boring) to type up in one Reddit comment, so I’ll just say - in a lot of situations, lower parking space minimums ARE a good idea. Yes, in some situations they’re a terrible idea (fuck you, developers who build condo buildings with 1 parking stall per unit in the middle of nowhere on the edge of the suburbs.) But we shouldn’t let the situations where it’s a bad idea scare us away from making positive change. What we need is to take a serious, nuanced look at our current regulations and decide where to relax them."
Edmonton,ff9v4y7,t1_ff9jp8n,1579722149.0,"Noooooo... nothing like that at all.


Let me explain with a metaphor... imagine you’re at Christmas dinner and people start talking about politics (fuck!)


Your brother starts talking about how he’s really angry/sad that his boss tried to discourage him from taking paternity leave. “I just need time to take care of my newborn child, and my boss is acting like I’m lazy and saying insulting things about me! He legally can’t stop me from taking it, but I’m worried that I’ll upset him so much that it will hurt my career. Why the fuck is society so sexist! This is fucked up!” 


Your sister agrees, and says “wtf that is so fucked up and your boss is such an asshole! It’s extremely important for men to get to spend time with their kids. I wish people would just start treating genders equally already, I hate seeing all this sexism! Plus, paternity leave helps women too, preventing men from getting it is bad for literally everyone!” 


Then your mean drunk uncle leans towards your sister, and goes on a rant about how he hates women and feminism, like he does every fucking Christmas. “Those fucking feminists should talk about real issues like this one instead of whining about the wage gap, which is women’s fault anyway for being lazy! Maybe if those stupid feminists got real jobs they’d see how the world really works! But they won’t because they’re all gold diggers! Plus everyone knows men are smarter than women due to scientific biological reasons so maybe they should...”


Your brother and sister get up and walk away because they don’t want to hear any more of your uncles bullshit. Your parents start yelling at everyone. You sigh into your mashed potatoes while wondering why Christmas dinner always sucks.

In that story, your brother is /r/menslib (the subreddit that is ACTUALLY a good place to talk about men’s rights), your sister is twoxchromosomes, and your uncle is mensrights. It’s one of those hateful little corners of the internet where people go to complain about imaginary made-up enemies."
Edmonton,ff4ogrh,t1_ff4apxe,1579568591.0,"As a girl with a STEM degree,  I’ve worked in a lot of places that are not exactly awesome for women. Not shitty enough for me to change careers... but shitty enough for me to change jobs a lot of times, trying to find a workplace where I can feel like a real part of the team and where I don’t have to sit in the lunchroom wearing ill-fitting men’s safety equipment 3 sizes too large that I can barely work in... silently wondering how I’m gonna find time to change a tampon (or even stay hydrated) when I’m expected to spend the next 10 hours in the field without access to any kind of bathroom or outhouse.... while sitting and eating my lunch next to a bunch of posters of mostly-naked women taped to the walls... or trying to get work done while trying to ignore the guys on my crew who are just standing around bragging about how they abuse and cheat on their girlfriends and ranting about how all women are apparently evil gold digging childish harpies (while occasionally giving me the side eye)... and/or sitting at my desk silently and trying to keep a blank facial expression while the guys openly watch porn on their phones while commenting on the women’s bodies and making inappropriate jokes about my (nonexistent/imaginary) reactions...


I think you’re going to make a much bigger difference in the world than almost anyone from my graduating class. Sure a couple of my classmates might design a safer version of something and save a bunch of lives, but 99% of them are just going to be cogs in the corporate machine, engineering systems to maximize efficiency and profits for some CEO... At the end of the day, the only thing that would be different in the world if most of their jobs hadn’t existed would be the numbers in some rich people’s bank accounts. 


Whereas if all goes right in your career, you might change the lives of thousands of women. Maybe a single mother will double her income by taking on a job that previously only went to men due to a lack of bathroom access, and her kids all have better lives due to it ...maybe a female engineer who would’ve changed careers decides to stick to STEM because she finds a team that doesn’t treat her like an outsider, and she redesigns a highway to a safer layout and saves dozens of lives... maybe a woman or 12 or 100 will become upper management when they otherwise would’ve been stuck in lower middle management because the people in charge of promotions always think they’re “not a good fit personality wise”... you’re actually *doing something positive and awesome* with your life.


I hope that 20 years from now, women won’t have to deal with the crap that I’ve dealt with... and it’s people like you, with gender studies degrees, that are working on making that happen :)"
TrollXChromosomes,ff3o431,t1_ff3k3dc,1579545207.0,"I hate being in those situations because what are your options, really? If I, a women, decide to pretend to not notice people cleaning up, and instead I intentionally hang around holding a beer while they work, I won’t look like I’m taking a stand against gender roles... I’ll look like a jerk. 


Generally my approach is to just pretend like I thought the guys were already willing to help, and casually tell them what to do like it’s a task we’ve been doing as a team  - “Hey bro I just noticed people are helping bring dishes into the kitchen, guess we’re gonna grab some eh?”  - or sometimes I’ll do it non-verbally and just cheerfully hand my brother a stack of dishes while pretending that I thought he wanted me to do it - and then hope that they’re self-aware enough to feel ashamed. 



I have no idea if they actually understand what’s going on / feel any shame whatsoever though, or if they’re just thinking “wtf why is this chick so bossy?! I was in the middle of doing something fun!”"

Edmonton,ff241oz,t3_eqz6ha,1579493221.0,"Step 1, if anyone tries to hire you for a job that requires working outdoors, just say no ;) I have Raynaud’s too and I’m pretty sure that nothing cheaper than a NASA spacesuit would make me able to actually use my hands/fingers outdoors in the winter. I used to have a job doing snow removal and building exterior maintenance and NOTHING worked for me. (Though I’ve never heard of heated work gloves before and someone commented about those.... maybe? But wouldn’t the glove get pretty quickly damaged by the pressure from the shovel? Are the wires in the gloves going to zap me if/when I rip the fabric? Would my fear of crushing/bending the wires interfere with my grip when I have to carry heavy shit? I have a lot of questions!) 


Step 2. Reusable heating packs for your hands: refuse to leave the house without them and always keep them ready to go. Tuck them into your mittens when you go out. Obviously you can’t effectively carry or grip anything when you’ve got them in your mittens, but that’s okay because you followed Step 1 so the biggest thing you’ll be carrying is your cell phone ;) For shoveling your sidewalk if that’s something you have to do, I recommend the “shovel for 30 seconds, keep hands curled up in mittens with heaters for 30 seconds, shovel for 30 seconds again” strategy. since you’re not on the clock you can use whatever tactic makes the pain go away.


Step 3. You know how I mentioned that I used to work outdoors? I had thinsulate steel toed boots from Mark’s and they somehow magically actually kept my toes warm! I have no idea how, since my toes freeze after 2 minutes in any other pair of boots... so yeah, maybe invest in some of those? Wear them with wool socks of course. 


Step 4. You know those electric blankets/heating pads that they sell at pharmacies, for back pain? Buy one and every time you come in from the cold, rest your hands and feet on it until you feel better. Maybe that’s simple/obvious advice but it makes me feel sooo much better that I had to mention it, I do it every single day! Or you could buy electric hand warmers and heated slippers on amazon, but the pharmacy heating pad will be way cheaper and has the bonus that you can also use it when your back hurts ;)"
Edmonton,fewng37,t1_fewmyqt,1579415724.0,Good luck with your project :)
Edmonton,fewmoaa,t3_eqhmgg,1579414878.0,"I found this article online which might be an interesting start!

https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.2919861


If I was a city employee trying to convince my boss to build heated bus stops, I’d start by trying to identify bus stops that frequently have vulnerable members of the population waiting for long periods of time. So instead of saying “let’s heat every bus stop in the city”, I’d say “let’s heat the bus stops in front of every semi assisted living senior’s home”. 


(You could also go for a “maximize the number of people helped per dollar spent” approach and suggest heating the 5 most frequently used bus stops in the city, but c’mon, “helping kids and seniors” is more marketable and more likely to get your boss a feel-good newspaper article written about them. You want to get approved, right?) 


My next step would be to look into potential funding sources - the last city I worked in wouldn’t spend a penny on a bus shelter unless Jim Pattinson (the billboard guy) footed the bill, so I’d try and come up with a pitch that I could send to Pattinson that would convince the company that heated bus stops will make people spend more time looking at ads. I have no idea if this is relevant to your project, I just like whining about how annoying that situation was ;) Seriously, it was so irritating trying to get new bus stops approved! 


My third step would be to research the existing heated bus shelters in other cities in Alberta (which based on that news article, should be pretty easy! FYI, Calgary just installed a bunch of heated shelters in 2019. Their MAX rapid bus lines have all heated shelters.) Compare pros and cons of the different styles used, design your own version that’s like a better version of your favourite type of bus shelter, then do all that building material and cost calculation crap that you learned in school."
