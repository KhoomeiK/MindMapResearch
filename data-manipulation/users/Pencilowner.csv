JoeRogan,ffe2m5x,t1_ffdtkkd,1579835077.0,"I don’t think trump should be president but I don’t think the direction the Democrats are going is any better. Progressive direction is fine but there is active opposition to compromise and bipartisanship as if allowing half the country to have an opinion other than the main stream progressive one is unthinkable. 

The republicans have rallied behind trump in a weird way too. Even the purple republicans are only going to vote against the president if they can get away with it without tipping the scales toward the Democrats. 

If you look at the Clinton impeachment vs the Trump impeachment at least during the Clintons the senate leaders from both sides came together to make rules and processes fair and unbiased but today it seems like the republicans and democrats are about 10min away from turning the senate into a bar brawl. 

I watch congressional hearings and the tone of representatives have edged closer and closer to outright disgust and hate. I blame the internet for making people respond to only the most extreme example of representation. Even guys like Lindsey Graham during the Clinton impeachment would concede certain points but today it seems like everyone is reading a script to stone wall everything they can.

I agree with what OP said about hatred and divisiveness"

Same with bosses who constantly look for busy work to occupy people's time but adds nothing to the end goal of a persons job. I work at medical clinics and hospitals and have seen some straight cruel things being done to employees for no reason. Like making someone sit without their phone at a desk for 2 hours before they can go home because a patient canceled but they have to ""work"" their whole shift. If you arent advocating for your employees' happiness health and general wellbeing then you are just playing at leadership and that is the worst kind of authority."

AskAnAmerican,fekmjhl,t3_epbhve,1579203155.0,"The UK is a lot more morbid with their TV shows. They allow you to suffer with characters. That stuff doesn't play to American audiences because they want the catharsis of a redemption arc. If a character gets knocked down on American TV they have to be back on their feet by the end of the episode or Americans start to fall off. 

A good example of this is the UK office vs the US office TV show. The UK version shows David Brent as the pathetic loser he is and we watch as his vision of his life never matches up to the reality of any situation. The show toward the end is just watching someone screw up constantly. That kind of wallowing in failure doesn't work in the states because the assumption is even the worst people have redeeming qualities and Americans wait for the silver lining. 

Canadian TV is great too they have a similar humor to Americans. One thing that is great about Canadian TV is they can get away with things that hit too close to home for Americans. American politics make important topics very controversial. I watch Letterkenny and Trailer Park boys which are hilarious with a Canadian background but the School Shooter episode of 19-2 may be the greatest American story never touched in US media out of fear.

They get famous for specific critiques of specific policies and then trot out to other topics. When they expand their critique to the whole democratic party though they usually do it as a team sport kind of rally. That is the entertainment aspect bleeding through legitimate opinion. Once you are a ""conservative"" personality you cant really back peddle on your team. You lose followers and money if you concede anything. That is the part that sucks. You don't get a lot of good middle of the road talk hosts. They really have to pick a lane and it makes the political discourse stupid most of the time."
AskAnAmerican,fekhgng,t3_epn87d,1579200126.0,"When campaigning politicians will say whatever the polls tell them to say. When they get to the office they have to bear the actual burden of leadership which means they don't have as much control as they promised and must make concessions just to get basic things done. So yeah we vote for candidates based on what we think and feel about them but generally, the office of president is a lot of posturing with a few decisions here and there about the controversy of the day.

DunderMifflin,fdfw40a,t1_fdfuc8j,1578371792.0,It was played up but Pam was obviously emotionally compromised and leaning on him already. They were friends and the way she ran to him and the way he reassures her were meant to build tension but like Ive said the onus was always on Pam and neither of them crossed the line.

I think the whole relationship with a cameraman breaking the fourth wall was just awkward but they drove that plotline with the ""what if"" factor right off the bat. That was driven by Pam, not Brian. He was just a newly single friend who was there for Pam a couple times so the only ""what if"" was if Pam was going to crack under the pressure of her problems with Jim. They intentionally wrote Brian as just a good looking guy in proximity to Pam. OP said Brian was the one with feelings and I just think the tension was less innocuous than that."

AskReddit,fdb0euq,t3_ekcgua,1578252317.0,"The premium stuff is just longer versions of the free stuff. One thing that is good is the variety. Pornhub is like an advertiser for all the premium sites. They have clips of everything and with premium you get the full versions of some of each site's content.

 Not really worth it in my opinion because the free stuff usually has the best parts to tempt you to buy. It's like any trailer for a movie with the Rock once you have seen the trailer you don't really need to splurge on the movie you already saw the good parts. 

The thing I like about pornhub is how they are supporting the Youtube model and finding creative ways to make pornstars. Anyone can go on pornhub and sell videos of themselves. It's part of this wave of new internet celebrities that pop up on twitch youtube or anywhere really. If you have a cute face you can make money online these days just broadcasting yourself. I have seen guys and girls who were fairly average looking make thousands of dollars online without even taking off their cloths. 

Part of the reason the girl next door is online is she is lonely. Millennials are the most lonely generation ever since most of our social lives have been offloaded from reality to the cloud. Even regularly social people have a portion of their lives online and feel lonely sometimes. That is super obvious if you watch a live stream chat for a gamer or a pornstar. It's an interesting world to visit and participate in but it's designed to make you pay to feel like you have friends and the fact that those communities are thriving makes me worry about the future when the facade starts to fall."

AskReddit,fcmmf0t,t1_fclz3pr,1577781493.0,I was in the military and guys reach out to me from time to time. Most of the time I ask if they have talked to anyone else. The last person most men will turn to is a spouse or family member. It took me an hour talking to one guy just to get him to give his wife his gun so he wouldn't use it on himself.
AskReddit,fcmm7nn,t1_fcluxo4,1577781218.0,I don't hide my thoughts feelings and emotions but most people can't handle seeing them. It's one of those things where you bring it up around anyone and they scan the room for a lifeline.
AskReddit,fcmlzgq,t1_fclwgrc,1577780916.0,I didn't talk to my brother for a whole year and neither of us realized it until his wife pointed it out. She thought we were talking on the phone or something. We are better about keeping in touch now.
AskReddit,fcmlu80,t1_fcm5znv,1577780729.0,I use the bathroom as an excuse to get away from people. Its the last bastion of male solitude.
AskReddit,fcmlmtc,t1_fcmc2mc,1577780465.0,Some guys dig a muffin top.
todayilearned,fclzjtv,t1_fcl1ggz,1577760351.0,That’s what your snout was designed for keeping you from accidentally poisoning yourself. There are obvious exceptions but stuff like chicken you will have no doubt when it turns.
AskReddit,fclzc4u,t1_fclix7v,1577760196.0,I had a girl order the duck on a date once. She said she never gets to eat fancy it was like$50 bucks after drinks. Them she took a few bites of it and decided she didn’t like because it was too greasy. I did not go out with her again not because of the price but because of how brain dead you have to be to think that is acceptable behavior.
AskReddit,fcly64w,t3_ehpvwl,1577759352.0,If I get a head start I go to the mountains take my food and water and camp out in a ravine for two days. Even if someone was looking right at my camp there are enough brushy tree stands I would be obscured. I would spend my afternoons on my glassing spot and watch for people coming up the canyon. I’ve done it before. I told my dad where I was once and he couldn’t find me with a google maps pin on my camp.
AskReddit,fclxm2q,t1_fclgkf5,1577758956.0,"It’s not just that but most people have familial knowledge on how to raise kids and don’t want to be guilted or forced into going out of their way to be told how they should raise their children. The problem with child rearing courses is they are often framed as social groups and usually attended by people who probably don’t even need them since by default they are already more inclined to seek out better information.

The people who really need it are really young couples and poor couples who may end up with children despite not being prepared to take on the added stress of another mouth to feed. 

There is the added problem that universal values are not normal. I have seen children suffer because their parents are helicopter parents and I have seen children suffer from having parents that have latch key kids that raise themselves. There is a huge spectrum and every child is different. Having a class where a group of “experts” tell a group of parents what children are like is just as likely to do harm as good."

science,fcl1xfb,t1_fcjt7gq,1577738031.0,Its a theory that the little ice age which was unusually cold weather around the 16th century was due to that current not transferring energy north. A lot of European art shows snowy villages in places that don't get snow anymore. The famous story was Mary Shelly wrote Frankenstein during a summer where the bad weather kept her and her travel companions stuck indoors.
Homebrewing,fcec994,t1_fcco6vn,1577619102.0,When I drop my wort from the boil kettle to the fermentor I let it fall into the fermentor and agitate. Basically the more bubbles the better. That is different than when I keg out of the fermentor where I use the side of the keg to keep oxygen out and no bubbles.
amiugly,fce6vj9,t1_fce5c83,1577617462.0,You are still telling a story. I still don't know you and you still are trying to justify yourself. I didn't ask for anything you did. Just stop.
amiugly,fce3la5,t1_fce23bt,1577616587.0,I didn't mean to offend you but we are strangers so I don't know why you are trying to prove yourself to me. You posted some photos and I gave you an honest opinion. Justifying your life to internet strangers is the kind of the unapproachable aspect I was talking about. I'm sure you are a decent person but let others judge you for who you are you don't have to spin a narrative it only obscures the reality of you. I'm sure your story about yourself is the only thing you want people to see and it shows.
amiugly,fcdrjmx,t3_ege7hq,1577612887.0,Little volume to the hair if you can manage and you got it made. A little lipstick would really make your natural look pop.

amiugly,fcdq5sm,t3_eh44h4,1577612466.0,Shoot it Ill give you an honest but probably harsh opinion.
amiugly,fcdpw87,t3_egnkun,1577612395.0,It's the style that makes you unapproachable. You are pretty but no one wants to confront all that. You seem like you would hate anyone who called you beautiful as much as you hate yourself. The colored hair and metal face seem like a call for help more than a fashion statement. That is just off the cuff reaction though don't take it personal.
amiugly,fcdp27z,t1_fcaohby,1577612179.0,"I'm on board with this grow your hair out and stop making ""quirky"" choices they aren't doing you any favors. You have the potential for a killer natural look if you can get the makeup right."

amiugly,fcdneqo,t1_fcc1rtv,1577611671.0,seriously some makeup and a little volume to your hair and you are getting into hot territory.
amiugly,fcdm26f,t3_eh3v6s,1577611294.0,Its not your look its your personality. You can fix a personality though read a book or two you will be fine.
