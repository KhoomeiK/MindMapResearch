IllegallySmolCats,fehdvqe,t1_feg8g91,1579114529.0,"Are you in the US?  I am...so I can only give advice on what is available here.  There sure is a difference in the nutritional needs of a kitten vs a cat.  Kittens, up to 6 months, need kitten food.  Sorry he was getting cheap crap before, glad you are gonna change that!  BTW, after 6 months it will only make them fat to have kitten food, so stop at 6 months.  Wet food is always better for any age cat.  Dry food can be OK if it's quality stuff.  Royal Canin kitten food, wet and dry, is the best IMO.  Either ""baby cat"" or ""mother and baby cat"" varieties.  But it's pricey.  Others marked 'kitten' should be fine, just not Purina or Friskies if you can help it.  Grain free is great for older cats.  Chicken is OK as a treat or a supplement on top of food.  You are right that people food doesn't have the needed nutrients for felines.    
(BTW - maybe the vet meant there was no reason for grain free in kitten food, but not that it would hurt to feed grain free)  
Gradually introduce new food mixed with old food - 25%, 50%, 75%, etc.

You gave a home and a life to a helpless animal.  She gave you love in return.  You'll know when she is ready, and it will be the last kindness you do for her.  It will shatter you, but you will know it is for HER.  And she will know she is gonna see you again - God said heaven will be where we are the happiest.  She will be there.  Big hugs to you!"

Gift Shipment #1Usps

Does that mean my SS says they shipped?  I didn't get a gift - and yes I know to be patient even though this note has been there a week. And I will report no gift at the correct time.  But just wondering what action puts this note on my page.  I thought I read that you get an e-mail when your SS ships.  Thanks!"
