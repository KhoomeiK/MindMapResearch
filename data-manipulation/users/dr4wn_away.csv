food,fetmboy,t1_feti2j1,1579376830.0,"4 cups flour
2 tablespoons kosher salt
300ml warm water
1 and a half tablespoons of yeast

Sprinkle the yeast onto the warm water, then pour the yeast water into the flour and salt and mix. After you mix, let it rise for 30min then put it on a cutting board with a little oil so it don’t stick. Fold the dough over its self 10 times then put it in a bowl with a little more oil and let it rise for 2 hours. Then plop it back on the cutting board and cut it in to 4 equal chunks. Then they suggest getting a clean towel or pillow case and sprinkling it with flour. You make the four chunks into 1.5 inch thick logs as long as you can and place them on the towel/pillow case and cover them with greased plastic wrap or another towel. Let them rise for another 30 min. Set the oven to 450 and put a tray full of water on the bottom rack. Then make  the traditional cuts on the logs before you pop them in the oven for 30 min. To make them extra crispy, you can spray them with water when you put them in too.
