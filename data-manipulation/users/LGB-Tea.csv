Animals bond with their owner deeply, your dog is grieving the loss of you as much as you are grieving the loss of them.  Keep your chin up.

Advice,fe4tkta,t1_fe4skj2,1578862680.0,I was talking about the mother.  But you put a good point both the child and the mother have a much higher chance of not making it through the birth and/ or having major issues. Do you know how far along she is? Does the child have a heartbeat yet? Does it have a brain or any personality? Would the father be supportive in the long run or would he ditch? Would the child get put into foster care? Will the child get adequate care? Will the parents assist the child giving birth to an infant? Will the mother die in childbirth because her body isn't developed enough to give birth?

I know all of these thoughts are terrifying, but without communication you wouldn't have gotten this far in your wonderful marriage,  let her know how you are feeling.    There is no shame in going to see someone for mental health.    A therapist is there for someone who is mentally ill, but they are also there for people dealing with everyday stress and anxieties.    I would much rather you be embarrassed about telling someone than boiling in your thoughts. Please, don't let it take over you, holding it in does more harm than good.   Take care of your mind and body for they cannot survive without the other."
