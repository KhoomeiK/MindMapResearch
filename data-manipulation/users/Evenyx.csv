KoreanBeauty,ffehp6n,t1_ffehekk,1579848438.0,"I had been using salicylic acid on a weekly basis, and glycolic acid on occasion but since these didn't really help with the problem (i had tried different products with acids over several years), I don't count them as ""acne products"".
So I had built up a tolerance for these acids. Besides that, I was cleansing with cosrx good morning low ph and/or purito defence barrier. 
When I started using AzA I stopped using glycolic acid, and I only used salicylic acid on my nose every now and then for blackheads. I used AzA a couple of times a week until my acne disappeared, now I just maintain my skin by using it a few times a month."
SkincareAddiction,ffefg32,t1_ffcvoc0,1579845973.0,"Yes! I also have their salicylic acid, the retinol, the niacinamide and the peptide serum.

The SA I bought because I was only so-so happy with other salicylic acid serums I had tried. This one is a bit stronger. Since the AzA is working so well I don't need the SA often, I mainly use it one night on occasion if I see I have a lot of blackheads. It works really really well.

The retinol is also a bit strong. I don't use it often because I just can't handle the first stage with retinol qnd skin becoming flakey and dry lol. So I've been using a drop on occasion in cream. I like the consistency tho, its a clever ingredient mix and the shea butter will help somewhat with the dryness.

The niacinamide and peptide serums I have just bought so I don't have an opinion yet. I'm expecting the niacinamide to be like The Ordinary's serum."

KoreanBeauty,femcv8g,t3_epxley,1579249050.0,"I just want to create an appreciation post for azelaic acid.

This ingredient is severely underestimated, I spent years reading up on skincare (reviews, scientific research, blogs, news articles, dermatologist information posts, etc etc), but this ingredient never really came up.

I had fairly OK skin in my teens and twenties. I've had blackheads that I have peeled (stupid I know), but no bad acne. I didn't care much about skincare, didn't know anything at all tbh...

This changed when I was around 27. I got bad whiteheads on my cheeks and my chin. My skin was dehydrated and oily and makeup looked awful. I got a birth control implant when I was 29 which made everything worse. This is when I started doing full on research on skincare. I built great routines, got the oily skin under control. Learned that my implant probably made everything worse.

I had severe hormonal acne now, that left me scarred and horrified. At 30 I finally managed to get the birth control implant out (long story). But the acne persisted. No amount of salicylic acid or different AHAs helped me. They calmed them down, but didn't remove the problem. Niacinamide didn't work. Vitamin C didn't do it. Retinol didn't help. Epiduo helped somewhat, but only for a while. The acne always returned.

Then at 31, I finally found some articles mentioning azelaic acid, and the fact that this is a **SUPERHERO** to fight acne.

**What it does:**

* Fight acne bacteria
* Keeps your pores unclogged and ensures skin doesn't build up comedones
* Increase cell turnover
* It can also help with skin lightening and calm rosacea.

In July 2019, I bought the bottle pictured, from **Korean brand Cos De Baha**. I have never regretted it. Cheap, and so incredibly effective. It took a couple of weeks, and some months to fully stabilize, but now at 32, my acne is gone, I rarely get whiteheads anymore. My skin is calmer and looks better. I just repurchased, as I do not want to live without this product. I still have scarring to fix, but at least now that can be my only focus. 

13 weeks ago, I recommended this product to a friend. She just reported back to me and said after 9 weeks of using it, her hormonal acne is finally gone. Like, GONE. No trace. She hasn't been acne free for years, just like me.

So, if you have tried **EVERYTHING** and **NOTHING** works... If you haven't tried azelaic acid, you definitely should <3.  I hope you'll have the same great experience as me and my friend."
Skincare_Addiction,fembv1v,t3_epwpdi,1579247726.0,"It's impossible to say for sure.   


1. As snakey\_child mentioned, you could be using the wrong products. You should check the ingredients of the serum and moisturizer to see if they are comedogenic.   

2. If you have never had a routine before, it could be that the cleanser and detox mask is pushing the existing impurities out of your skin.  


With cleansers and acids, it's always possible that the skin will get worse before it gets better. This is called a purge. It can last several weeks."
diet,fembj7l,t3_epq5e9,1579247308.0,"PSMF. This way you can eat LOTS of protein, not lose much muscle, but lose fat.   
The fasting will make you lose both, which would be somewhat of a waste for you. The PSMF is short and shouldn't be used for more than a couple of weeks unless the person is severely overweight. You sound like you're definitely not.  


You can also google Lyle McDonald rapid fat loss diet, as I believe he made a diet similar to PSMF.

HaircareScience,fe6soib,t3_eo0blo,1578903556.0,"semi-permanent dye just stains the hair, so it's possible the dye just didn't stick. Could be a number of reasons for that. To make color stay in grey hair, you'd usually need ammonia to penetrate the follicle to add pigment."
