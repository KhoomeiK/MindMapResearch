Use swiping to filter by your preferences, donâ€™t leave it up to others to see that and filter themselves out.

In the organizations I volunteered with, cats who displayed aggression issues were quarantined and only allowed to be adopted into homes without children or other animals. Cats with FIV were not adopted into homes where other animals displayed aggression, but unless they themselves were aggressive they were not quarantined from being around other cats or barred from going into homes where the other animals were peaceful."

While that may be her recommendation, there are plenty of other veterinarians and animal shelters who donâ€™t see a problem with  an FIV+ cat cohabitating with other cats given the proper knowledge and assessment of risk. I have personally never seen any fixed cats try to have sex, but Iâ€™m not saying that means it doesnâ€™t happen.

There are a lot of misconceptions about FIV and I recommend anyone looking to adopt do research and form their own opinions."
funny,feejrpy,t1_feeakqz,1579035167.0,"Itâ€™s contractable through deep bite wounds or, less commonly, passed mother to kitten. Situations where blood is shared. It would be ideal for her to be an only cat but itâ€™s not necessary. I volunteered at a shelter/cat cafe for two years and our FIV kitties cohabitated with the rest of the cats. Unless aggression becomes an issue itâ€™s not necessary to keep them quarantined from other cats. 

With proper care they also have every chance of living a regular lifespan.

EDITED TO ADD: I would encourage anyone looking to adopt a cat to research FIV, ways itâ€™s transmitted, and assess for themselves if an FIV cat would fit into their home. The stigma attached to FIV is sad and leads to wonderful animals being passed over."
Bumble,fee99fh,t1_fee8zx8,1579029032.0,"Thanks! I reported the image itself on the app, then reported/blocked the profile and in the details put that he had sent an image of his penis.

At any rate, whatever it was it made me anemic and they at one point said if they didnâ€™t get in to stop it soon they may need to think about a transfusion due to my hemoglobin levels, which were dropping with each new blood sample they took."
funny,fchvqdk,t1_fcgudfx,1577654704.0,"Despite your feeling that it wasnâ€™t much by volume, the anemia and near need for a transfusion as a result of my having a grapefruit sized hemorrhage was real. Maybe that isnâ€™t a typical experience because Iâ€™m already prone to anemia, but it was my experience and you being annoyed over it is offensive"
funny,fchuhcu,t1_fch4idz,1577654281.0,They use that measurement for the surgery prices lol. This one probably would run about 2 kilos pure before insurance.
