Princess was perennially late to class and the professor got a kick out of it and refused to ever start the class until Princess arrived.

It's compromised solely of party sponsored wumaos, bots, and misguided individuals of Asian decent who feel disinfranchised in the western countries they were born (and grew up in their entire lives in) so they have a skewed rose tinted view of the CCP and see it as a means of challenging western society. Despite their hate for western society and eagerness to point fingers at literally every country except China, they are largely born and raised in western countries and would never choose to live in China willingly. 

They vehemently believe the party should destroy any dissent in Hong Kong, all of the hk protestors are terrorists, Tibetans are terrorists, there are absolutely no human rights violations in China towards the Uygher population or otherwise, and actually believe that somehow America orchestrated the ""fake protests"" in Hong Kong. The Party is only portrayed in the kindest of light, China should go to war with everyone, etc. It's a toxic sub that serves solely as an echo chamber for that type of CCP loving rhetoric.

After not being able to deal with her insanity anymore, I broke things off. She would wait outside my door for God knows how long until I came home and say she left something at my house. This happened a lot.

One day I was going to add a new email account to my phone and realized that her email account was still saved on my phone. I shouldn't have checked it, but she was actively stalking me and I needed to know what I was up against.

There were tons of emails to some witchcraft lady she found online somehow, all about me. She was paying this internet witch like hundreds of dollars an hour for what I would consider witch consulting. It was all about me. How to cast spells to get me back, how to enchant me, how to curse my new gf, all kinds of crazy shit.

She was using this lady as like a weird therapist almost, asking her a bunch of relationship questions and shit too. This went on for months. The witch lady was getting a little annoyed with her I could feel, although she couldn't complain that much because she was draining her for literally thousands of dollars.

She told the witch that some point I told her she needs to seek professional help. The witch actually told her that might not be a bad idea lmao.

She ended up moving into the house of a mutual friend (this girl from school) that was literally 1 building away from mine. My friend told me that she was always burning weird spices and candles. It was at the direction of the witch actually. It was all creepy af and eventually she cut my brakes."

So I was on the end, my gf in the middle, and her friend on the other end.

I'm the morning my gf woke me up with an unexpected handy. Idk if she was trying to get her friend to join or what. I assume so? But her friend was like blissfully innocent. So she's working it and her friend was like turning in bed and moving a little like she was half asleep. But she could hear what was going on and the movements and stuff but in retrospect I think was just trying to indirectly tell us to stop by pretending to sleep but being restless. I asked my gf is she asleep and she said yeah and continues. I ended up bustin a nut on her shirt and she got up to change her shirt and came back to bed.

Later in the morning that girl was like super awkward acting and uncomfortable and left immediately. We saw her at school and she was super distant and acting weird. She knew.

I came up with a plan for everyone to save face. I told my gf to tell her that I had a lot of mosquito bites and that she hopes she didn't disturb her cuz she helps me scratch them cuz they bother me.

A few days later I see the girl on the bus. She sits next to me and gives me some bite cream and tells me to use it on my bites. Words cannot express the strength I had to use to suppress my laughter or smiling. I thanked her and went home and told my gf and we almost died laughing.

Idk if that girl actually believed it because she was so innocent or if she just wanted to believe it so much that she forced herself to belive the lie. But everything was all good after that. Although she never slept in our bed again haha"
sales,fdmrrvh,t3_em5efw,1578562567.0,"To be honest, I haven't heard of too many SaaS sales internships. Most companies looking for SaaS account sales aren't going to invest time in an internship for that and training is usually fairly minimal. Maybe it's just not a thing in my area.

I would highly recommend you spend your summer getting some actual sales experience under your belt selling *something*. Cell phone sales is a good starting point for example.

Later by the time it's time to graduate, you can  actually be considered for an entry level Account Executive role at a VAR (value added reseller) like CDW or soemthing like that. Most of those companies are high turnover and always need people. You'll sell a little bit of everything, hardware, software, cloud services, everything. Who knows, you might like HW or networking sales better anyways. 

Rock that for a year and now you can pretty much walk into 80% of the SaaS companies you come across."
japan,fdmr9pz,t1_fdlg2t7,1578561861.0,"This reminds me of a funny Japanese misunderstanding told to me while in China..

These two Japanese girls came to visit my friend while in China and took a taxi from the airport to his spot.

Driving in China is pure insanity, especially when it involves taxi drivers.

The girls were taking to each other in Japanese and were terrified by this taxi drivers driving and kept saying ""kowai! Kowaaai!"" (meaning scary/scared) because they hadn't experienced the hazards of Chinese taxi driving before.

The taxi driver heard this and thought they were saying ""kuaì! Kuaì! (sounds like"" Kwai! Kwai"" which means hurry or speed up in mandarin).

He then proceeded to significantly speed up, thinking they were telling him to go faster haha.

Idk why but your story reminded me of this haha"
mildlyinteresting,fdmqvet,t1_fdlz8bo,1578561308.0,"Fun Fact:

There is a place you can still buy Dr. Pepper with real sugar cane in it, made in the original recipe. 

Dublin, Texas!

The restaurants there literally have it on tap, it's sold on glass bottles in the stores, and it's absolutely heavenly.

Bonus Fact:

Dr. Pepper was created by a pharmacist in Waco, Texas and was originally made as a medicine to aid indigestion and preceded the creation of Coca-Cola by a year."

espresso,fdlbmr2,t1_fdl69yv,1578520568.0,"I see. Honestly in your case if you're not looking to fall into the deep (and expensive) hobby of espresso making and your primary goal is to save money at home making your own cappuccinos/lattes, the Incanto is a great option.

How it compares to Starbucks is somewhat relative. The custom built machines Starbucks uses crank out 100s of shots continuously for 10 hours a day and cost around $50,000 per machine so it's not exactly fair to compare it mechanically. 

That said, if you use quality water (filtered) and a quality freshly roasted bean, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with how good you can get at home, even with an entry level superautomatic. Also, Starbucks is a very low barometer in the espresso world so it's not exactly too hard to surpass it.

The quality of the shot itself somewhat comparable between machines, it just depends on temp consistency, duration of shot being pulled, pressure, etc. What people pay big money for is the ability to very finely tune these small nuances and you can fall into a rabbit hole of trying to get everything perfect. 

Superautomatic machines take a lot of the guess work out and don't have the 'fun' of doing it yourself that most people on this sub are in it for. But in all honesty the convenience of superauto is great in the morning.

Sorry for the long post, I am rambling. But my point is, just get it because you won't regret it! I've had 2 Saeco's, they make an excellent product."
espresso,fdl5ihm,t1_fdkzrn2,1578517397.0,"Ah nice. Yeah superautmatics are great for quick and easy drinks in the morning for sure. If you wanna take it a step further you can plug it into a smart plug and have it automatically turn on in the morning to heat up and be ready for you. Be careful with that though because if your water reservoir is empty you could burn out your boiler if it tried to heat up with no water.

Just watch a lot of videos on how to maintain and clean your machine and it should be good for a long time! Congrats!"
