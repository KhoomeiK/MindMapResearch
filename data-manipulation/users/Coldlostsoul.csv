The more you think about your insecurities the worse they will become and it will keep and becoming worse, so try your hardest to think positive now matter how hard it is, if you start getting a negative thought change it to a positive.

I was self conscious about myself with my acne and weight. I would always look at myself in the mirror and would always think negative about it and would say stuff like “my acne will never go away I hate my face” or “I’m so skinny I feel disgusted by myself” and all it did was make things worse, my acne was inflamed and red and all over, my weight was 116 LBs. I started thinking good thoughts and after awhile my acne started getting better and I started gaining my weight back. I now weigh at 122 LBs and I’m slowly gaining more."

depression,fef2gej,t3_eoqsq9,1579046603.0,"Bro you are not a weak loser you may think that because society has push so many label on to people and there’s so much negativity being spread around but you aren’t a weak loser at all. People who have depression or anxiety are the most mentally strongest people ever and endure a lot that others wouldn’t be able to fathom. Try not listening to too much music because in the end it only makes depression worse, if you listen too lots of  music listen to 432hz music instead because it’s a natural frequency while 440hz promotes negative thoughts and emotions. When you do decide to get help and they try to put you on medication say no because that will not help, they will try and tell you that it will help but no it doesn’t. I used to listen to music everyday all day even at school so no one would bother me and I still do but not as much at home. I spend time meditating, reading and learning now and it’s helped lots."

depression,feez4j5,t3_eoomu6,1579044411.0,"Depressions good for economic growth because they make money by feeding you pills that don’t do shit, but keep you going back so they either up your dosage or give you different pills to try, and the therapists, psychologist, Psychiatrists get paid for saying the same shit to people and tricking you to coming back making you think that they are helpful. Now some therapist and psychologists actually do help people but most don’t that’s why you see so many posts with people saying they seen so many therapists and it didn’t help them.

There’s agendas that are going on but people don’t believe it’s happening because they are being told the lies from the government and rather believe them than do research. That’s why almost all food is gmo and filled with pesticides grown from water that has fluoride in it and fluoride is a neurotoxin which lowers IQ. They are trying to program and control us, so we don’t research this stuff and find the truth then don’t. Study the laws and secrets of the universe, main law is law of attraction though.

If you start eating healthy, exercise, meditate, getting sunlight, stop using their distractions that promotes mainly negativity (social media, games, tv, news, etc) connect with nature and be kind and positive to one another. It will help you with depression but won’t get rid of it you will have to dig deeper and find what is making you depressed in the first place."
depression,feex104,t3_eok6mu,1579043059.0,"People normally judge other because they have their own insecurities so they judge to make themselves feel better or their just plain out negative and those people will only attract negativity. Don’t let that shit get to your head because there are consequences of overthinking negative stuff like that because you will become insecure and those negative thoughts will fuel off your insecurities.

Labels are a big mind fuck that society has made, for example if you get called stupid by one person you probably won’t think much of it, but if you get called that by 3 people you most Likely will start to believe it and might end up acting stupid."
depression,feew52l,t1_fee4jtg,1579042498.0,Demons don’t exist they made it up to force you to believe in their false religion. They white washed the bible to hide the truth and keep y’all blind from it.

depression,fe8rziq,t3_enx6ff,1578930015.0,"My mom is depressed and when I was living with her the house hold was just depressing and made my depression much worse. So pretty much your depression will spread onto her unless she finds a way to vent. My way of venting was just playing video games all day and night eating unhealthy and day dreaming, but ultimately it made me even more fucked up and on top of that she would always scream at me calling me worth less, lazy, stupid and much more. You gotta show your daughter lots of love and not neglect her. If I had a mother who would of showed me love and care rather than just neglect and buy me materialistic shit I probably would be a different. But nope I’m 18 and have nothing to show for"
depression,fe4zx1i,t1_fe0zgta,1578864364.0,"Well still the whole point is to get you going back for more so they can milk you for money. Pills don’t really work, they will work for a while when you first start using them but eventually they won’t, so they will up your doses and put you on other types of medication."
depression,fe02lkn,t3_engju0,1578801502.0,Take the spiritual route that’s what I did and I've learned that It won’t fix your depression but will help ease it and you will perceive life in a different way.

depression,fdzzwb1,t3_end4xm,1578799738.0,"IMO you don’t need a therapist they aren’t really there to help you their there to make money off you. Their job is to say the same shit to all their patients and give them pills so that they keep coming back for more.

 I recommend you try and get outside. Explore nature by yourself or with others who like it as well. Trust me I’ve been depressed 4yrs now and in the summer I went hiking, started eating healthy, working out, stopped masturbating once daily and gaming, it made me feel really fucking amazing like I haven’t felt in years until I went back to high school and then winter came and boop back into my hell hole, but I meditate, eat healthy and work out still, not daily even tho I try. It helps a lot with depression it’s crazy but it will not fix it permanently"

ForeverAlone,fdz6j9u,t3_ene7bt,1578787158.0,"Ok so since your friend doesn’t give a shit about you drop his ass and make new friends that actually care for you. Put yourself around positive people (energy) which is very hard to find since pretty much everyone is so fucking negative nowadays due to social media and what not, but eventually you find someone."

depression,fdyus6m,t3_enduv0,1578783810.0,"I’ve been going through the same thing except with no friends or gf just family that I have nothing in common with, but try to meditate and connect with nature, get as much sunlight as you can because it’s something else when the sunrays hit you. It won’t get rid of depression but it makes it a little easier to live with."
depression,fdyspv7,t1_fdyow31,1578783200.0,Drugs are legal just go to your doctor and he will prescribe them for you just as long as you can say you have problems and can pay for them your good to go
depression,fdyqpah,t1_fdurclp,1578782597.0,I self-diagnose myself because I don’t trust them fucking doctors or therapists because they only want you for your money and don’t give fuck all about us. They will feed you pills and bullshit so you keep going back for more and you will never truly fix once you become depressed you stay depressed. You will end up repairIng yourself if you try really hard but depression will linger inside you like a disease until something triggers it than there you go spiralling back down into that hell hole.
