If anyone ever took me for male, it was for a much younger one than my actual age. So if I got treated as male at all, it was as a boy, not a man. And because I rarely got treated as male at all, I was also missing out on a lot of male socialization experiences. I don't think I really felt like a proper adult man until (1) I looked like one and (2) got the accompanying experience of other people treating me like one.

Don't try to do more than you're capable of for fear of others judging you. That is how you hurt yourself. Stay within your limits and use correct technique.
2. **RE-RACK YOUR WEIGHTS**. It's nobody's job but yours to pick up after yourself. Also, leaving plates on the bar or leaving dumbells lying around can disrupt others' routines while they sit there trying to figure out whether someone is actually using that equipment or just being a dick.
3. Don't take up multiple pieces of equipment at the same time (e.g., doing a circuit set) unless the gym is practically empty. If you're holding 3 pieces of equipment while the gym is busy, you're holding up 3x as many people as if you just did 1 exercise at a time.
4. Don't sit on equipment talking or playing on your phone. Resting between sets is totally normal and cool. Just hanging out on the equipment for 10 minutes when you're not actually using it is not.
