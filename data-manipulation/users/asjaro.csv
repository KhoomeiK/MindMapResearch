ufc,feybp0y,t1_feyafzd,1579443370.0,True. They're also quite keen on Ode Osborne afaics. Not sure who they're pushing from the Pettis fight. Probably the Wheaties Box Kid.

ufc,fexfx6v,t1_fewm08p,1579430333.0,"What was up with that? Everyone on the UFC roster wanted on that card. Dana went with... well, I'm not sure who most of them were. 

Holly Holm certainly gave the fans a treat with her ""hold em to the cage for 3 rounds"" tactic. Although the crowd thought that bout was full of life, coming straight after the Russian boa constrictor strangled the energy out of the place.

If that was your first experience with the UFC then you would not be returning."
MMA,fexe8ap,t1_fewkjf1,1579429572.0,"Yeah, that pensioner did feel bad afterwards, that Conor may have hurt his hand on his chin, but said he felt fuck all, so it should just be a bit of a red mark that'll be gone in five minutes. 

He also said he was sorry Conor seemed so upset by him saying that Conor's whisky was 'wank', and if he  wants to come back and do it again he'll pretend to move his head back a little bit; but there's no way he's pretending it hurt or taking a proper dive. He'd never hear the last of it from mates at the church coffee morning and bingo if they think he was chinned off such a little fanny. (His words, not mine)"

Bitwig,fdjpfti,t1_fdjmhgj,1578482188.0,"Great tip, thanks. I try to work with the belief that less is more. I am making music with as few tracks as possible right now and as few sounds on each track. That way I can focus more easily on what I want to learn. It takes a lot of discipline but it seems to help my work flow."
Bitwig,fdjmvn5,t3_elq9ij,1578478600.0,"The posts you describe are the same on every sub. The person who posts them thinks that they are shortcuts to popularity, which is one of the reasons why they are seen as low effort, imo.

Either that or the person has an issue that they can't articulate.

I think one solution to the first one is to have a welcome thread. It's a cheese stuffed crust on a 4 cheese pizza with extra cheese but you could just delete the karma whore posts and direct them to the welcome thread. Make it so that they can't post again unless they've done 100 lines of ""I promise not to be a karma whore again."" Second offence is 1.5M lines. Third is death, obv.

You could ask people to be specific as to exactly what their issue is, with the second one."

Bitwig,fdjjzux,t1_fdjjm51,1578474411.0,"""Make shitty sounding music."" I am a pro at that already. Seriously though, I know you're not saying that I should make bad music, more that I should just make music. Any music. Lots of music. All the music! I had the good fortune to have access to a lot of different music when I was younger and one day it hit me that I was learning what I liked from the music that I disliked, as much as from what I loved. I guess it's the same way with making music. Try as many ways as possible and you will have a more informed choice.

I can see that The Grid is an awesome tool, so I just need to jump in and ignore the part of me that prefers my comfort zone.

Great YT tip. I think that after a while you can tell within the first few moments whether that person will be helpful."
