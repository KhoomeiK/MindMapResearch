Fairly strong effort mountain biking at 15mph, your 9 mile loop would take .6 hours. When really going at it I can burn about 500-600kcal/hr. 
So at 550kcal/hr average x .6 hours = 330kcal Burned in that 36 minutes. You’re a little bigger, maybe you go faster or slower. So I’d say a range from 300-400kcal for that effort for you."

AskReddit,fd55jx4,t1_fd51tn3,1578174388.0,"Don't put parenting in general as the cause for this - they've chosen to forego those other things in life (friends, hobbies, staying informed and up to date on current events) of their own accord. 

A lot of parents do this - they literally live only to serve the needs of their children. It's sad, because when the kids rebel to get their independence, or eventually move out on their own the parents look at each other and are completely lost. They have given up everything, even their intimate relationship with their partner, and now they're just roommates with no one to care about. All their friendships have dissolved, the friends that remain still have THEIR kids so they have nothing in common, hobbies are gone...I've seen it and it's a cautionary tale to keep a life for yourself outside your children.

But, I'm proof it doesn't have to be that way. You just must convince yourself that YOUR time is valuable for YOURSELF, and that your kids are not going to die if mommy and daddy go out for date night once a week or twice a month, and if they continue to go do their own hobbies such as going to the gym, yoga, cycling, etc. It's healthy."

smallbusiness,fcffr2z,t3_eh62jh,1577629537.0,"Your profit and loss statement, which shows how you’re doing at regular time intervals, included the following items:

Top Line Sales or Revenue (same thing) - Gross sales amount here. You sold 100 widgets for $10 each, revenue is $1000.

COGS - Cost of Goods Sold goes here. Those costs are directly related to the manufacture of the goods. That would be material, direct labor, and packaging costs to produce those 100 widgets if you build them, or your cost to buy them from someone else if you outsource the manufacturing. Say you pay $2 for material, pay an employee $3 to build it, and $1 for packaging materials. Your COGS is $6 for each widget, times 100 widgets = $600. Or, in your case you buy them for $5.50 each, and pay $50 to ship them for a total COGS Of the same $600. 

Gross Profit - Gross Profit is your top line sales minus your COGS. In this case $1000 - $600 = $400. $400 divided by your top line sales of $1000 is .40 or 40% Gross Profit Margin. Gross profit is important but way different than net profit. 

Expenses - these would be line items for rent, guaranteed payments to owners, utilities, bank fees, sales and marketing costs, indirect labor costs, meals and entertainment, taxes paid, insurance, auto expenses, the list is endless. It gets more complicated than this with depreciation expenses and such, and you’ll probably want to have an accountant help with those fixed asset allocations. For our example let’s add up all these costs (some could be zero) and say your expenses for the time period are $250. 

EBIDTA - Earnings before Interest expense, depreciation, and amortization. Unless you’re financing a bunch of equipment or have a C Corp that is paying corporate taxes, you can closely approximate your net income with this number. 

For this simple exercise your earnings, or EBIDTA would be your gross profit less your expenses. $400 - $250 = $150. $150 divided by revenue of $1000 is .15 or 15%. 

As I said, unless you’re doing a bunch of fixed asset depreciation or paying corporate taxes based on structure, EBIDTA and your Net Profit are about the same thing.

As an aside, these numbers at a high enough sales volume 40% gross margin and $15% net margin are generally about right for a manufacturing company, unless they have no competitors or do have some strong intellectual property protecting their market.
