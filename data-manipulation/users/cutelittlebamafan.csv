Dogtraining,fff0did,t3_et5x6d,1579872160.0,"I think dogs pick  which person to go to when they need something in particular . My dog will come to me if she is not feeling well  or just needs me to love on her. She will go to my husband if she want to play rough of bother him :). Do not take it personally,  as it’s not you. If she walks pass my husband, he will tell her to pay the kissing toll, she will lick his hand and just gaze into his eyes. I can tell her the same thing and she just walks past me. My husband has never had a female dog and he said  he can see a huge difference in males and females . I’m the primary caregiver for my Heidi, so we are a little closer and  she loves him in a different way. Look at it like having a child: when a child gets hurt, he/she will go  mom. We all bond to people for different reasons and I’m sure it’s the same for dogs. Maybe give him something that ONLY comes from you, a special toy or treat. Trust me, I wish my girl would leave me alone sometimes and go hang out with her daddy. Best of luck."

CrohnsDisease,ffaub40,t1_ffatfk8,1579744658.0,"Drink while prepping so you don’t get dehydrated. As long as what you consume is CLEAR AND NO DARK Jello, you will be fine. I can only speak of my Preps but I don’t drink/eat after midnight as I finish the prep by midnight so I don’t have to continue in AM, as it’s usually the instructions. It should have on instruction “morning of procedure” of things to do.  They make it more complicated than it really is."
CrohnsDisease,ffat7p0,t1_ffasuwt,1579743932.0,Did they give you an instruction list on when to finish the prep and when to stop eating/drinking?
CrohnsDisease,ffas9dz,t1_ffar6fs,1579743300.0,"Their are several “prep” methods. I personally  can’t do the Miralax as others have recommended. The  doctor gives you what he/she thinks  will work for your issue. I’ve had to do 2 preps in the past, as my CD is severe and hard to get good images. This prep is fine to use as your doctor felt it was the correct one for you ."
CrohnsDisease,ffargb6,t3_eskyru,1579742762.0,"I always drink(lots of water)  and eat(jello and broth)  as directed until midnight. Drink cold, drink sprite or lemonade after you drink each glass to help with the taste. This brand, IMO, is the worst. I get a colonoscopy every 6 months and haven’t had this one in a LONG time. I noticed the clerk taking off shelf last month  and I just shook my head. . The  prep is the worst part of the procedure. You will feel rested after you wake up tomorrow.  I wish you great results."

germanshepherds,ff62x14,t1_ff5uobz,1579617786.0,"I agree 100%. I would make sure it was my last option and  with irresponsible dog owners,  dogs roaming in neighborhoods   and certain breeds that are prone to this behavior, you have to protect yourself and your family. I love animals and do not promote violence but my life or theirs, it’s no choice."

CrohnsDisease,ff608k1,t1_ff52rbv,1579615763.0,"Well, I ended up in a wheelchair for 2 years  from Remicade,  so I know how dangerous this drug is. I’m on Stelara and I like it because either it’s going to work or not within 4-6 injections. I know people that are Remicade and their doctors are still “hoping” it works after years of no improvements. We have to be our best doctors and knowing what’s being used to treat CD only gives us power over our disease."
CrohnsDisease,ff5zv9f,t1_ff52x75,1579615466.0,Look into both of them. Both have had really good results. Remicade is so rough on the body. Medicine has came a long  way since Remicade and it seems as doctors go to Remicade first. I wish you the best.

I’ve had to euthanize my family dog and the LAST thing an owner needs to feel is rushed during a time of heartbreak. Good for you for standing up for human decency .

Go 2 inches outward from bellybutton. DO NOT inject near scars or any near any skin  irritation site.     Pinch a little fat and hold. Do not squeeze hard as you do not want blood to accumulate in that area. If you are injecting on left side, put your right hand against your right hip. Come in at a 45 degree angle (like throwing a dart) and inject. Reverse if you are injecting in right side. Most primary/Gastro  doctors will have a nurse assist you if you have questions. When I started Stelara, a nurse was sent to my home to help me. Now, my husband gives them to me as I can’t see a needle going into skin."

Start at head and go down coat. When my GS is not blowing coat, I use every 3 days. I vacuum every day and I see a HUGE difference when I brush on regular basis. A quality comb/brush is the key."
dogs,fedwoa6,t1_feduz9l,1579021471.0,I agree. I was saying  for the ones that do not research the needs of a puppy then decide it’s too much.

Dads, sisters, aunts, uncles, brother, brother in law, sister in law, father in law, mother in law and friends are guilty of this as well. I hope that makes my “example “ better for you.

dogs,fedsic1,t3_eomrod,1579018950.0,"Puppies and kids have 1 thing in common: They grow up. Don’t get ANY animal if you can’t afford them. I read so many stories about animals not getting the care they need because “we can’t afford it”. If you don’t have the funds to provide the basics and then an emergency , which could run into the thousands, get a fish. Puppies are cute, mommy loves getting Johnny a puppy for his 10th birthday. Johnny takes care of puppy for a little while, mommy has to step in after he’s tired of doing it. That cute “puppy” grows into a 80 pounder and mommy can’t handle. Mommy works 60 hours a week, dog gets  neglected. (Being left alone 12 hours a day) Mommy gets rid of dog due to “not having “ the time to care for it. The cycle repeats for another family.  Their are SO many responsible dog owners and the shelters Thanks us for not adding to their population due to irresponsible dog owners. Downvote, that’s okay. People need to learn what they are equipped to handle in life. Now let me go hug my 94 pounder fur baby.  Edit: some people are so sensitive that I said “mommy”. This was just an example,  as male and females may be in this position. Hope this heals the fragile."

CrohnsDisease,fec6pln,t3_eo6fn0,1578967574.0,"One good thing about Stelara is normally the drs will do a colonoscopy after 4-6 injections to see if they see improvements. I was injecting every 8 weeks, had colonoscopy after 4th injection and now will be taking every 4 weeks. Over my 20+ years with CD I’ve learned that some doctors will take the” let’s wait and see” approach. The problem is their “ wait and see” may be years of taking something, having horrible side affects,  doing damage to other parts of your body and is not working. The injections are easy to do. I wish nothing but the best for you."
germanshepherds,feaw39e,t3_eo94dt,1578952774.0,"I 100% agree. If they are chipped and no collar, you are asking someone to take time out of their day to take YOUR  dog to vet to scan chip. Just put a $2.99 name tag and chip if want both. If a person loses their iPhone, they will order a new one  in 10mins but let’s not put put a name tag/rabies tag, as required by law  in most states on a collar. Our area is full of posters of missing dogs and then you read “No ID” on collar."
dogs,feajpkq,t1_fe9vrui,1578949641.0,"I agree. Dogs are still dogs and  it’s so sad that other people will be so irresponsible to put their dog is harms ways.

dogs,fe8xtvz,t3_eo5ud3,1578932165.0,"This is a huge issue in my area as well. The neighbors dog came  into my yard yesterday and my dog chased out of my yard into street. The were given a warning a month ago from AC, Now, I’m facing a warning for not being able to control my dog. The neighbors lied and said my dog just came into their yard. We have asked them for over a year to please keep their dog from approaching our 90lb dog (their dog 10lb) but they refuse. Why would people put their dog in harms way and think it’s okay to do that. So here we are. I agree with OP. It does make your home and your outings very stressful knowing that you obey the law and you can be charged even if another dog invades you and your dogs private space. We have plenty of property and we still have issues with stray dogs and irresponsible dog owners. Try to enjoy your surroundings and don’t let others ruin your day."

CrohnsDisease,fdzno4q,t3_encbyc,1578792088.0,"One thing to remember, patients  with CD have different symptoms. Try not to compare your situation with other CD patients. Knowing your body will really help the doctors find a good treatment plan that meet YOUR needs. I’ve had CD for over 20 years and one thing I have learned: Doctors may know about CD but you know your body.
