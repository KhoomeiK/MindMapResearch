You tell him, that you're his friend and that you're going to help him and that everything's going to be alright....... And then you put a wire on him, and you find out who's selling him...drugs, and then, you get that and you flip him. Turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy, to people really, really bad."

I grew up in the middle east, 18 years,  and yet encountered more religious muslims a in my first few years of living in the US than that whole time. Some combination of the world getting more religious, those growing up in the US feeling they have to embrace their religion as part of theor identitiy morr after moving and, admittedly, perhaps partly based on the social strata we were in and idk, possibly the fact m7ajabat (headscarved ladies) were less likely to go out in public, certainly to those dodgyish shopping centers you'd go as a teen, back then.

For advice, i'm not sure other than maybe offering to switch beds with her? You could phrase it as being for her convenience if it were weird/awkward for her having to face you while praying"

Ps: props on opening up your mind and stepping out of your comfort zone. Religion aside even, the world needs more people like that, willing to hear out the other perspective"

DunderMifflin,fctar5i,t1_fct96ku,1577937509.0,"Yes it's a timekeeping method. But it's the timekeeping method we use. And it's the one you're using in your attempt to claim this is a new decade because of the last zero in in 2020.... 2020AD in the gregorian calendar. 

100 is a triple digit year, but the 2nd century (ie 2nd one hundred years) literally starts at 101. When you're making cookies, the 2nd batch of dozen starts at the 13th cookie. The 12th cookie is part of the FIRST dozen. Or if you're hung up on tens, and grouping together cookies by ten to give people, the 10th cookie still is part of the first ten, going to the first person. 11th one is the start of the second group of cookies

Also, you realize we're in the 21st century, right? Not 20th, just because it's 2020. 'There's no zeroth century'. 1-100 AD was the first century"
