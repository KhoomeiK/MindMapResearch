CPTSD,ffbpxjw,t3_eshsn8,1579777841.0,"This is painful to read. I am that brother. I’m dying a
of addiction right now. Nobody in the world has ever cared about me except my sister. But it just can’t seem to make me feel ok, andI just keep sinking deeper into self destruction."
CPTSD,ff8f8j7,t3_es7t5n,1579675922.0,"One of the most painful things I’ve come to realize is that suffering-whether caused my myself, someone else, or chance-doesn’t count for anything. I’ve paid my dues two, three, four times in life. I purified my heart. I switched my goals to the purest of the pure. I still made mistakes, but purged the vanity and malice from my personality. But here I am in the worst place I’ve been in my entire life. Lately, I’ve just been giving money to homeless people when I’m in a crisis. It helps me feel better as I cope with the realization that I might be headed there too."

NEET,fej9p9v,t1_fej8ttg,1579163061.0,"I think most NEET people can probably program. It’s a personality thing. People-oriented people fail pretty hard at it, but I don’t think that’s you. It’s true that programming is mentally taxing, but you may be selling yourself short on your intelligence due to your lack of financial/academic success. I did that for years. I didn’t even realize how smart I was until I started coding. 

Yeah take an intro class, get some remedial math help at the same time. Get checked for ADD, do what you need to do in order to put yourself behind the keyboard everyday, you know? I started learning on Codecademy, and I found it to be a fast way to learn."
NEET,fej7bcb,t1_fej6vrv,1579159915.0,"Yeah, I focus on front end a lot. And YES! The competition is rediculous. Particularly because I’m being underbid by foreigners. I’m in the NYC area now, but I’ve pivoted to smaller cities to get a leg up."
NEET,fej6gd1,t1_fej67j8,1579158839.0,Right now I’m interviewing for junior dev roles
NEET,fej6foz,t1_fej67j8,1579158817.0,"For me it has taken forever because of family issues. Neither of my parents understood what I was doing teaching myself to code, and my mother even tried to sabotage my efforts to keep doing it. I lost three and a half of those five years just trying to sort myself out emotionally and gain financial independence.

I took 1 college class, learned JavaScript and some frameworks on my own, and I learned Ruby on Rails and React at a bootcamp."
NEET,fej5m5j,t3_ep9lv1,1579157834.0,I made that same mistake. I didn’t do an internship and it fucked me hard. I’ve been learning software for the last five years trying to break into tech. It’s a real fat ugly bitch of a task though.
SuicideWatch,fej4w5f,t3_epe8l3,1579157016.0,"A lot of this boils down to being young. I remember a lot of days like what you described in my late teens and early twenties. I resented my father for a thousand reasons, and I haven’t talked to him in a couple of years. Just keep your eye of the prize of independence."

CPTSD,feamhd2,t3_eo8jae,1578950290.0,"It sucks that the only jobs available to young people with little experience are customer service jobs. Those jobs really favor a certain personality type, and if you don’t have it, you won’t do well. I don’t have that personality type either, so I can sympathize with you. I don’t know what to say, but I’ve struggled with the same problem. In fact, I’m still stuggling with it as I’m looking for a new job."
Unemployed,fe6dxgj,t3_enqsw3,1578888066.0,"It’s how I found out everyone I know is garbage. Actually, most people are garbage. There are maybe, *maybe* three people I know in this world who aren’t total shit."

Doomers,fdu1qdn,t3_en35mh,1578725960.0,"One time I noticed this, and I thought

*Hey there should be a doomer manifesto, so we all can be crystal clear what doomerism is about.*

But then I realized how creepy that is and that the whole thing is subjective in the first place. To try and define doomerism in concrete terms will inevitably ruin it for everyone."
aspergers,fdtxqgb,t3_en2ajp,1578723952.0,I can’t say yes as strongly as I want to through text. I relive things that happened in my childhood over and over and over and over. Then I relive bad experiences that happened recently just as much. I feel totally stuck and I can’t move on. I would pay any price to be able to do so.
CPTSD,fdsl118,t3_emy93b,1578704540.0,"Being unemployed is hard in and of itself. But when you have psychological issues, it’s a waking nightmare. All I can say is that you are safe in your own hands. You are a capable person, and you can find a way, even if it’s painful."
AskEconomics,fdsj57x,t3_emzynh,1578703753.0,"There is a site called shadowstats.com that has information about this issue precisely. I forgot all the specifics, but the idea is that they use the old way of measuring unemployment and find different results."
AdviceAnimals,fdpjv8e,t3_emkyti,1578630613.0,This is actually a good point.
Doomers,fdpjnkw,t3_emd1y6,1578630442.0,"Cheers, brother."
Christianity,fdpj6bt,t3_emet7g,1578630057.0,"As a 28 year old with this same problem, I have two things to say.

1. It got easier to manage as I got into my late twenties.
2. I figured out, after years of reflection and research, that it was a symptom of my depression rather than a cause.

I’m not here to try to try to persuade you that the same is absolutely true for you. But I just wanted to share my experience. Peace."

Christianity,fdopirz,t3_emefht,1578609981.0,"If I remember correctly Tacitus, the Roman historian, mentioned Jesus by the name “Christos.” I also think there is a Roman public record of his trial in Judah."
