cats,ffsyf6u,t1_ffsxzz4,1580197744.0,I have several photos and videos of her but I haven’t posted anything. I suppose if I figure out how Reddit wants me to post them I can provide some updates. I’m constantly fighting with Imgur and v.reddit and the like
nba,ffstakb,t1_ffshz5g,1580191665.0,"Could be you or me tomorrow. You got one life. Don’t let it be an angry, vengeful one. Kobe wasn’t."
cats,ffsrlpu,t1_ffsrdlo,1580189960.0,"I have a floor to ceiling glass shower door (yes, it’s as dumb as it sounds) and every time I take a shower she can see me so she tries to “save” me. I usually pick her up right when I get out of the shower just to let her know I’m ok. I do it so much that she now actually asks to be picked up. Never seen a cat do that before but you won’t hear me complaining"
cats,ffsr7yz,t1_ffsqseu,1580189600.0,I really have rarely felt my heart melt so much. Part of me thinks she did that to everyone that walked in that room but on the other hand I don’t think many people could’ve resisted that so idk.
cats,ffsr34p,t3_ev12lq,1580189475.0,"To add to this, I hated having to limit myself to three cats but my local shelter is very crowded (with people) and they don’t want people milling about all day taking up the volunteers’ time. So they make you pre-fill out an adoption approval form with 3 cats. 

This was also a few months ago so I know I’m cheating by posting this now but rest assured Riley has turned into an adorable, cuddly little gremlin child who is destroying my sleep schedule and everything I own just like any good cat should."
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,ffsli2x,t1_ffslf5q,1580184689.0,That’s what I thought. I figured if they were making a stand-alone movie he wouldn’t be an outright villain especially with the whole Spider-man situation kinda up in the air. OP’s comment had me doubting though

hockey,ffkjle0,t3_eu1734,1580023840.0,Was at the game. It’s been years since I’ve thought seriously about Green Day but damned if I’m not gonna go give all their shit a listen now. Billie Joe is a legend
StLouis,ffg0cra,t1_fffxftk,1579895721.0,Does the Fields on Lafayette have them? I’ve never checked
StLouis,ffeoomb,t1_ffenc2l,1579857704.0,I didn’t expect to get any answers at this hour so thanks haha at least I have a lead
coolguides,ffdmzhi,t1_ffdjy9e,1579824330.0,"It’s projection I think. I was forced by my paranoid parents to eat well done everything for 18 years. I thought I hated steak, pork, etc. The first time I had a medium rare steak was, and not to sound dramatic, but I think it was life-changing. 

I went through a phase for a little while after that when I wouldn’t shut up about it. My best friend in the world only eats well done meat and I’m sure I annoyed the hell out of her during that time. Truth is, I didn’t think I was better than her or anything, I was just worried that she was missing out on the amazing experience that I’d been deprived of. I think a lot of people grew up with parents like mine so I think that’s why a lot of people do this. Just a theory I have though."
coolguides,ffdm9a2,t1_ffczyp8,1579823885.0,I’ve never heard anyone judge a well done burger to be honest. Not saying it doesn’t happen but I wasn’t aware. I always thought since the meat is all ground up and smushed together it’s considered a lot riskier to eat an undercooked burger. Because the bacteria can get in the center. Steak? Yeah I definitely think a well done steak is the wrong move but never a burger
TheRightCantMeme,ffd3xug,t3_esvalk,1579812945.0,They are *so* close to figuring it out
comedynecromancy,ff3zut5,t3_erfafb,1579552474.0,I think it would be funnier if the guy on the right never says anything at all. Just insta-kills the guy without saying ok and then awkwardly stands there in silence for two panels. Just my two cents though
TikTokCringe,fevm9yh,t1_fevgf5d,1579399030.0,It’s not particularly spicy but it’s very good IMO
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fecrjb6,t1_fecra0p,1578981909.0,It’s Wes Anderson. Either you like him or you don’t. He’s never done it for me.
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fecqnl5,t1_fecqj5d,1578981050.0,My old roommate/ a guy who I consider one of my best friends insisted that once I watched Grand Budapest Hotel I would like it better than Interstellar (another movie that bonded us) and I was waiting for the movie to get great the whole time. It never did.
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fecnep4,t3_eog4m1,1578978287.0,"The Shape of Water and Grand Budapest Hotel are, personally, probably two of the worst movies I have ever seen relative to how hyped up they are. I will never understand why anyone liked those movies. It’s cool if you do, I never shit on anyone else’s taste in art, but I don’t get it. I would watch Thor: Dark World three times for every time I would watch them once."
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fece03x,t1_fecdihd,1578971665.0,"It’s halftime now. If it’s happening, it’s happening in the next 10-15 minutes. This is when captain marvel showed last year if I recall

Edit: didn’t realize it was an official Marvel announcement. Yeah, it’s definitely happening soon."
clevercomebacks,fe093pv,t1_fe07inx,1578806492.0,"Furthermore sometimes I used to get so worried about coming too fast that I couldn’t get hard at all. The first time I was with a girl who didn’t say anything or make me feel bad about it, I stopped having trouble. The ideal circumstance is not worrying one way or another. If you’re with a girl who makes you worry I would recommend reevaluating"
StLouis,fdzu354,t1_fdwxvth,1578795815.0,Ok so forgive my ignorance but why wouldn’t panhandlers eat them?

DunderMifflin,fdmcsyy,t3_em0v0n,1578545800.0,"The more I watch the bloopers and outtakes of this show, the more impressed I am with Rainn Wilson. He is so much the opposite of Dwight. I have no idea how he got his lines out after Phyllis gets flashed. I was cracking up even thinking about what was coming"

MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fdfiwcj,t3_el4a1j,1578362756.0,"At the risk of getting shat on here by people with more nerd cred than me, I’ve never read the New Mutants stuff at all or any comic Lockheed appears in. I know he’s loosely associated with the X-Men but that’s pretty much it. Why are people so excited about him?"
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fdf255w,t1_fder7cs,1578351584.0,"Had the same thought, which sort of makes me wonder, if that’s the actual reason does that make it more likely he’s a one-off? Like a villain? If Taika is the main reason he might not want to go off and do other movies with other directors. Total speculation obviously but that’s what I’m here for"
nfl,fd82ofe,t1_fd82ci4,1578213230.0,"First of all, It was a joke. Second of all, Kirby smart literally had a better recruiting class at least one of the last 3 years but I’m thinking two. Third, who cares, because again, it was a joke on a thread about the titans beating the patriots. It’s cool if you hate Alabama. Pretty much everyone does. But this is a patriots hate thread. Save it. You can’t even spell Saban right."
nfl,fd80w0q,t1_fd80s23,1578212636.0,Doesn’t even make sense but whatever. They’ve been beaten pretty badly multiple times over the last few years. Just not by former Saban assistants.
nfl,fd7s6sp,t1_fd74pcv,1578209270.0,"I know everyone hates Nick Saban and Alabama, but makes his record against former assistants that much more impressive imo. Dude is Yoda"

StLouis,fd3hnhg,t1_fd3fdr7,1578158370.0,I just called HCI in Springfield and was told “a couple hours” wait time. Not exact but I’m not sure it’s worth the 3 hour round trip
StLouis,fd3g2o2,t1_fd3fdr7,1578157979.0,Do you know what the other two in Springfield are?
StLouis,fd3e5gn,t1_fd3budp,1578157444.0,Never even crossed my mind. But I just tried and no answer
StLouis,fd3a0zl,t1_fd39va8,1578156214.0,Actually had that thought as well. Didn’t know if they’d be shorter enough to make it worth it though. Where’d you hear that?
StLouis,fcxroen,t3_ej7lpb,1578069529.0,I had one I liked a lot at Twisted Ranch. But I’ve also heard other people say they didn’t have great experience there. I certainly enjoyed it though
StLouis,fcvu00o,t1_fcucsvu,1578010070.0,Sucks to live in in my personal opinion. But it does look nice lol
StLouis,fcm0rz1,t1_fclt85i,1577761247.0,"This is blatantly untrue. Missouri residents are allowed to buy it. The purchase limit for out of state is half that of Illinois residents. And yeah, supply is going to be limited for a while, and yeah, it is technically a federal offense to bring it back across the River, but St. Louis City really does not prosecute small amounts of marijuana anymore. I don’t think anyone was asking about loading up a trunk or dispensary hopping, or even having a buddy buy for them. If the question is, can you drive across the river and buy some and return with it, the answer is yes. It’s expensive, you run the risk of waiting hours and maybe coming away empty handed, and *technically* you are committing a federal crime, but yes you 100% *can* do it. Don’t spread misinformation. That’s how we end up with problems"
StLouis,fclz5q8,t1_fclyosn,1577760064.0,I second Straub’s. I’ve only been to two of their locations (I think they have more) but in both cases the butchers and fishmongers really knew their shit and were able to get me exactly what I wanted. Not saying there aren’t better options out there because there might be but I don’t think you’d be at all disappointed with Straub’s.
