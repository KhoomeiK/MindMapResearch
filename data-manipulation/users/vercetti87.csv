AskMen,ffd8rl7,t1_ffbqzhz,1579815641.0,My parents are the same. They've been happily married for almost 40 years.
AskMen,ffd8ntr,t3_esruuu,1579815580.0,"My parents (happily married for almost 40 years) have for many years not bothered to wear their wedding rings all the time. They're fine with it but my grandmother doesn't like it or understand it. They've never cheated on each other and they're not polyamorous or anything like that.

As for me, I'm not married yet."
LifeProTips,ffaro69,t3_esf8n7,1579742903.0,"If you live in Australia, use the MyGov system. It's really easy. Although that won't work if you have investment properties or something else that complicates your tax return."
AskMenOver30,ffap47x,t1_ff8offt,1579741186.0,"I had testicular cancer in 2018. When I was going through treatment, the last thing I cared about was career advancement. Even now, I'm not really focused on that."
AskMenOver30,ffap10u,t3_es9pzu,1579741128.0,"I can relate. But I don't feel guilty about it not actively trying to get promoted. I don't want my life to revolve around work either. I earn a decent salary as it is and I have a mortgage, own my car outright and can make ends meet so I'm happy in that sense."
AskReddit,ffal01w,t1_ff9f9zd,1579738385.0,"Or... ""Why do you want to waste your time playing video games? Come watch Survivor (or The Bachelor or some some other crappy show) with us""."
AskReddit,ffakvnu,t1_ffaea3y,1579738294.0,Agree. I love video games as much as the next person (spent most of my childhood playing them) but I find board games (as an example) to be much more social than video games. Particularly as video games these days tend to be mostly either single player or online.
AskReddit,ffakpq4,t1_ff9z21v,1579738168.0,"A few things come to mind. Reading self help books (I would also say reading literature except I'm sure that it's more productive). Knitting. Learning how to play the guitar or the piano. Learning a second language. Studying and researching (either formal or informal).

But yeah, video games are no less productive than what people usually do in a man cave."

AskReddit,ffakadu,t1_ff9jsyg,1579737843.0,"Yep. I work a ""boring"" 9 to 5 government job (where I sit a desk all day) and the thing I like most about my job is the fact that when I leave work for the day (usually around 5ish) I don't think about work until the next day."
90s,ff538ab,t3_eroe5v,1579579007.0,I've never seen it (I was a kid when it came out) but I always thought the girls looked hot.
canberra,ff533ki,t1_ff50sa6,1579578908.0,"Thanks. Probably best if I try not to think of food though, which isn't easy when you're hungry :)"
Raynauds,ff4kv97,t3_erldt8,1579566067.0,"It's a complicated thing that has different causes and it seems to affect different people differently.

I'm 32 but I had never heard of it until last year, after I had chemotherapy (cancer treatment) and I found that my fingers go all white and numb when it's cold due to lack of blood circulation. And then I found it's something a lot of people have but usually for different reasons. In my case, it may eventually go away though (so I was told).

I find that the heat doesn't affect me in that way though. Neither does being stressed. And I haven't had it different colours either but I'm pretty sure what I have is Raynauds (doctors have confirmed that they're pretty sure it's Raynauds)."
canberra,ff4kfbl,t1_ff4ikte,1579565760.0,"Thanks. Well, it gives him something to look forward to, I guess.

Apparently I can have ""approved clear fluids"" which includes barley sugars and fruit jellies and most drinks but nothing with milk or fruit or seeds or anything like that in it (although clear apple juice or grape juice with no pulp is okay). I look forward to it being over (it being a colonoscopy). But I've been through a lot worse before (despite being only 32)."
canberra,ff4fqud,t1_feuz8ng,1579562535.0,I'm currently having to fast all day (for a medical procedure tomorrow). This is making me hungry.
canberra,ff1t6su,t3_er5poi,1579485627.0,I just watched some tradies on the roof near my work (south side) stay on the roof while the hail storm was about to hit then they got down just in time.
MapPorn,ff1qkxp,t1_ff1nh56,1579483991.0,"I know, right?

I suppose the fact that a LOT of tech giants are based there as well as Hollywood might have something to do with it."
MapPorn,ff1lj5e,t1_ff1je37,1579481146.0,"That is crazy. That may change in time though.

I had to check as well and I had to edit my comment to say that California has a larger GDP than the UK (which is a pretty major economy)."
todayilearned,ff1lat3,t1_fecsh36,1579481026.0,"I've never lived in the middle of nowhere but I don't think I'd like being that far away from any jobs, services or things to do (if you mean somewhere like Mount Isa, Broken Hill or Coober Pedy). But if you like that then fair enough."
todayilearned,ff1kic1,t1_fecpkxy,1579480656.0,"I won't argue with that. With mobile (cell) providers, there are cheap alternatives in Australia these days. I'm with Amaysim and I only pay $15 per month for unlimited calls and text and 5 GB of data. That's dirt cheap. I did have to buy my phone outright though. They use the Optus network. And the service is actually pretty good. But if you go with Telstra, you will get fucked over. They've always been expensive. 

Note: If you're not Australian, there are three major mobile phone (cell) networks in Australia, owned by Telstra, Optus and Vodafone. Telstra is supposed to have the best coverage, followed by Telstra, followed by Vodafone. There are a few other providers that use the Optus and Vodafone networks but to get Telstra  coverage, you'll have to go with Telstra (which I don't think is worth it personally).

As for ""traditional"" Internet, I see your point. I did a little online research and the cost is similar to other developed countries, however they have much faster internet than us (even now that we have the NBN). In fact, I can still get faster internet on my mobile than I do on my laptop at home. Australia actually has a very competitive mobile network these days."
todayilearned,ff1jije,t1_fedbnu7,1579480197.0,"Look in the mirror.

I'm Australian myself and I agree 100%."
MapPorn,ff1gyof,t1_ff1590f,1579479063.0,"I believe that the only countries (aside from the US) that have a higher GDP than California are China, Japan and Germany. Which is kind of mind blowing."
AskAnAustralian,ff1g6q4,t1_ff1fpwn,1579478715.0,Interesting. I know that there is a well known scene from Rain Man where they mention how Qantas was/is the only airline that never crashed (although I believe they have crashed but it's basically what you said).
AskAnAustralian,ff1fjob,t1_ff17f07,1579478434.0,I'm not sure. I know they have some sort of business relationship with Emirates.
AskAnAustralian,ff171pd,t3_er42ws,1579475890.0,"I would say Qantas because it is fully Australian whereas Virgin is part of the British Virgin Group. Qantas was originally an acronym that stood for the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services.

I wouldn't let that influence you deciding which airline to fly though. Actually I have a relative who works for Qantas, yet I still generally choose to fly Virgin."
AskReddit,feokvz1,t1_feofc0b,1579301519.0,"Different person here. But I know that here in Australia, many people were moving overseas after they finished uni and accumulated a ""HECS debt"" (to the government) and if they weren't living here then they didn't have to pay it back (unless they moved back). This may have recently changed however (I remember hearing something about it). Not sure how it works in other countries.

Here, the interest rate is indexed to CPI (a measure of inflation). You only need to start paying it back once you earn... something over $50,000 per year (can't remember the exact amount). You used to get a 10% discount for any voluntary payments you made but this was reduced to 5% and eventually removed altogether (basically removing the incentive to do so).

And because the government subsidises our education to some degree, it's a lot cheaper than studying in the US, however our conservative government would no doubt like for us to move to an American-style education and health care system where everything is privatised. Naturally most of us don't want that. University education here did actually used to be free once.  But a lot less people went to uni then so it probably didn't cost the government that much to subsidise it, unlike what it would cost now. This is why the government loves international students - because they don't get free subsidies.

I can't remember what my debt peaked at but I remember owing about $11,000 back in 2011 (a couple of years after graduating). I paid it down and got the 10% discount (just before they reduced it to 5%). So I was debt free until I ended up taking out a mortgage a few years later. But I would call both of those ""good debt"" because it's not ""dead money"", you do get something out of it.

I'll admit that my debt was pretty low. It would have been a lot more if I was studying medicine or something. I studied Information Systems."
mildlyinteresting,felk34a,t1_fek49e7,1579224073.0,"Good luck with it. I had testicular cancer (which had spread to the lymph nodes) and I went through two months of chemo in late 2018. That was not the best time of my life (to put it mildly). But I got through it and you will too.

When I finished chemo, unfortunately that wasn't the end of my cancer treatment. I ended up having some major surgery just before Christmas (2018) and I was incapacitated for a week afterwards. I can't move properly, I couldn't eat properly. It sucked. But I recovered from it. My body will never be quite the same again but I'm glad to have that over with.

Doctors will never say ""you're cured"" but they will say that you're ""in remission"" because they can't guarantee that the cancer will never come back. I've been in remission for over a year now.

I could argue that the chemo was the worst part because I had to go through it for two months (that was hard). But really the worst part was the first week or two after my major surgery. At least when I was on chemo, I could still walk and eat properly and function somewhat normally, it's that I was tired all the time.

I was 30-31 at the time (32 now) so I've experienced something that most people my age haven't. I wouldn't wish it on anyone though."
Cooking,fef0hf8,t1_fedcpnp,1579045296.0,Neither would I. I haven't got time for that. I'd have to be really into cooking to do that. Plus I live alone so the incentive isn't really there for me to get super into cooking.
Cooking,fef08sb,t1_fecwmpm,1579045139.0,"I don't own a food processor. I live alone (i.e. have no-one else to cook for) and I feel like I'd have to get really into cooking in order to buy a food processor.

I'm also not the type of person who would spend $2,000 (roughly what they cost in Australia) on a Thermomix. My sister-in-law has a Thermomix and apparently her one-year-old daughter damaged it.

Anyway, that being said, home made hummus does taste better than store-bought. But if you are going to buy store-bought, some brands taste better than others.

Oh and shredded cheese, I agree with 100%. That pre-shredded stuff is nasty. My old roommate only ever used that stuff (like a lot of people, he could do basic cooking but he wasn't a foodie)."
Cooking,feezy2i,t1_fedw0vo,1579044944.0,I find bananas do the same thing but probably not as quickly as avocados.
Cooking,feezrtf,t1_feeevhf,1579044831.0,I do enjoy cooking but at the same time I live alone and work full time so sometimes the incentive for me to get really into cooking just isn't there.
MapPorn,feeviak,t1_feds95e,1579042108.0,"I believe that the British didn't even treat their own (working class) people very well. Life was hard 200 years ago. But yes, a working class British person still ranked well above an African person in terms of social hierarchy.

Here in Australia, Aboriginals weren't even considered people until 1967. British convicts (including ancestors of mine) were looked down upon but they were still considered people."
canberra,feetuia,t1_fdp5db6,1579041083.0,"I'm fed up with hearing about it too. That being said, I fully support changing the date. But not so much that I refuse to celebrate Australia Day.

Given that we've been talking about changing the date for many years, I question whether it will happen anytime soon though. Mainly because nobody can agree on what date to change it to (same with the Australian flag)."

todayilearned,fecocgf,t1_fecnvpi,1578979022.0,"I wouldn't be surprised either. When it's really cold, not much can grow in it. Antarctica is one massive desert. It's just not what most people think of when they think of deserts."
todayilearned,fecmnpw,t1_fecigis,1578977707.0,Yep this is why I laugh when Americans and Canadians are afraid of Australian wildlife.
todayilearned,fecmgto,t1_feckwjj,1578977562.0,Yep. I'm in Canberra (basically our version of Ottawa) which had the worst air pollution of any city in the world recently (even places like Delhi). Normally it's very clean (as there's hardly any factories or industrial areas here).
todayilearned,fecma2o,t1_fecfcno,1578977424.0,"Yep, that would be nice."
todayilearned,fecm9f6,t1_fecjuig,1578977411.0,Same
todayilearned,fec6o93,t1_febxcaq,1578967554.0,"Here in Australia, it's the opposite. The vast majority of the country lives near the coast (mostly in the southern and eastern areas) because most of the country is desert. 40% of the population lives in two cities and a further 23% (roughly) live in the next three biggest cities (all of which are coastal).

People do live in the Australian outback but it's hot AF in summer and a long way from anywhere. There are people who find that appealing though.

Australia and Canada do have a lot in common (huge, sparsely populated countries that speak English and are still part of the British Commonwealth) but one major difference is that Australia has mostly desert whereas Canada has freezing cold wilderness and tundra."
holdmycosmo,fe749px,t1_fe6nioo,1578909772.0,"Yeah, it's Australian slang. Tradies means tradesmen. Boardies means boardshorts. Servo means a service station. Rego means registration (like for you car). 

Well, I can tell you that there's good money to be made being a tradesman in Australia. It can pay more than a lot of office jobs. Plumbers and electricians (sparkies) seem to earn the most."
holdmycosmo,fe5dq2v,t1_fe5cu23,1578868181.0,Yep. I've never seen those locks before so yeah I'll conclude that we just don't have them in Australia. I'm guessing it's an American thing.
holdmycosmo,fe5brlr,t1_fe3p7rm,1578867386.0,Interesting. I'm Australian and I can't imagine that happening here unless you were squeezing down on it the whole time. So it probably happened here too.
holdmycosmo,fe5bgp7,t1_fe56w8v,1578867320.0,Like on Seinfeld
holdmycosmo,fe5agvj,t1_fe4e68t,1578867024.0,"Australian here. I think it's more that petrol (gas) prices are so cheap in the US. Here it's expensive by American standards but cheap compared to Europe or NZ.

[https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/money/2019/04/americans-lose-their-minds-as-petrol-prices-climb-to-about-half-what-new-zealanders-pay.html](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/money/2019/04/americans-lose-their-minds-as-petrol-prices-climb-to-about-half-what-new-zealanders-pay.html)

It's worth noting though that Americans drive more than most other countries and they drive bigger cars so they use more gas. Then again, Australians and Canadians drive a lot too but still have to pay higher prices than Americans. In NZ, the UK and Ireland, nowhere is really that far away, so they probably don't drive quite as much.

We have trucks too (or utes as we generally call them - short for utility vehicle) but American size trucks (like, say, the Dodge Ram) are not common here (but I do see them around and they tend to stand out). The Toyota Hilux and the Ford Ranger are very popular here with tradies (tradesmen)."
AskReddit,fe59kyx,t1_fe0sawv,1578866850.0,"Interestingly, I grew up with a mum and a sister and I don't recall them having a bin by the toilet. Only in the bathroom. Hence why I wasn't sure about this. I don't know, I'm guessing they must carry their ""womens' stuff"" out of the toilet with them (they both still live in that house). I don't think I'll ask them about it though."
AskReddit,fe0qamo,t1_fe0pn8h,1578817360.0,Thanks
AskReddit,fe0pay7,t1_fdzrfrj,1578817090.0,What if the toilet is separate to the bathroom (as is generally the case here in Australia)? Should the bin still go in the bathroom? Because that's where I have mine (even though I don't really need it).
memes,fcx6xk6,t1_fcwu11h,1578053735.0,"It's more common for British shows to only be about 6 episodes per season. Fawlty Towers and The Office (UK) only had about 12 episodes made and they're still considered great shows. Pretty much every episode was good.

A lot of American shows that have over 20 episodes had a few episodes that were important to the plot but had a lot of filler episodes."
SeriousConversation,fbhlej9,t3_edct5m,1576876445.0,"32M here. Not American but I live in an English speaking country. The first point, I hear what you're saying but I'm in that exact situation. I have a mortgage, a car and a job with decent pay and conditions but I would say I love my job. It's a bit dull but my co-workers are good. But I work to live, not the other way around. Work is a big part of life but it's not the be all and end all of life. If you love your job that's awesome but most if us aren't sure what our passion is or it's something we're not sure how to make money out of.

What I do love about my job is that I can go home at 5 and leave work at work. I'd hate to be working 60+ hours a week or not being able to switch off.

Points 2, 3 and 4, I agree completely."
