But I thought the main point was to support that love is love, sexual attraction present or not (to include asexuality). Some people may dilute the importance of the community by pushing so hard to be included rather than simply a supporter when they're truly straight, some assholes might make a joke of it. But labels bring people comfort. Why would you want to put that down for those just lost and wanting a way to identify themselves and their preferences?"

socialskills,ffbuiux,t1_ffbdbi1,1579783211.0,"Still waking up and haven't had coffee so please excuse rambling and typos and stuffs. You shouldn't place so much value on my opinion alone nor on that of strangers who are immediate in harsh judgement. Studies go for random subjects because we're all so different. These are only the opinions of one young woman who often receives compliments on looks but has been told her fashion is hit or miss and who doesn't wear much makeup or put more than a couple hours a week to beauty routines and who's ideal would be hard to find outside of professional athletes and military men tending liberal (unicorns I say) who probably don't want to date me because I don't match the local standard of beauty. Of someone who has health concerns that have gotten in the way of some connections. The opinions of someone who has definitely settled for less than my ideal because the only two partners I've been with who were close to it were assholes (and it wasn't their gender, as they were male and female). I've found it isn't so important. It'd be nice if all my boxes were checked but being treated well and laughing together more is so much more important. Would I leave if someone with better looks and same exact other qualities came along? I'm human. I'd be tempted. I'd hate that I was. But I wouldn't have built a relationship with them. There wouldn't be the same experiences already in place, the connection. 

Not familiar with the studies you reference but let's assume they're accurate. The tendency of those relationships to last longer does not instantly doom relationships where there are greater differences. There is so much more that goes into a relationship besides looks. It may honestly put you at a disadvantage, but like most disadvantages in life there are some things still in your power to change. It isn't fair that this will often require more effort, but if you don't want to settle for less it's not great to expect someone else you're supposed to be caring about and sacrificing (to some extent) for to.

Reality is a bitch. It doesn't care what you want, be that your dream job or dream partner. Having preferences is your right as much as anyone else's. The right person for you will probably make concessions in their standards, if you're able to find them, because nobody is perfect. There are things you can do to try to improve but you're human and so are they. OP was very down on himself and in his hurt said some incel ish things. But these sentiments alone don't make someone trash or an incel or whatever. We say irrational things out of hurt. We put ourselves and others down when we aren't thinking right, and create unrealistic representations of our world as well. I'd have to have much more context to judge if OP was an ass or not. But on the topic of preference alone... No! This definitely isn't sufficient to call someone an incel and chuck them in a bin. The community can uplift and give advice and then his next actions decide that. 

To make some sense of what I've said: This is only my opinion. Rude people suck. You may be disadvantaged if you're born ""ugly"" or outside of what's normally considered beautiful where you live. There are still changes you can make to mitigate this disadvantage. It is okay to want someone out of your league, in life achievements or looks or whatever. But if you don't want to settle it's not right to expect them to. It may happen! But it certainly won't be given to you easily without you being able to give them something else they desire or need. OP probably isn't an incel, the internet is just short and cruel."
socialskills,ffay9p1,t1_ffauynx,1579747281.0,I didn't say you'd find 100% match. That's bullshit. You need to compromise and odds are better you'll meet someone who thinks you're worth compromising for too. Or not. But that is likely fault in yourself or them for lack of trying.

 As a woman I haven't thought about it but complimenting other women is easy. Complimenting men is harder for some reason. There's fear it may be taken wrong for sure. But. I don't find physical features all too important personally and men I know don't seem to purposefully put effort in in thst department so I figure they wouldn't care if I complimented their hair or outfit. I do find myself admiring men more for their knowledge/skills, hobbies, or achievements and women more for those things plus their appearance and style. Hm. Might have to think on it more.
