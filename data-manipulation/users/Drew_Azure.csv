Libertarian,fdk493o,t1_fd3zjsb,1578495678.0,I really hope so too. I live in VT. It's incredibly hard to establish a healthy sex life here which is unfortunate because sex and physical touch are so valuable to our mental health. I hope for my life that buying sex becomes legal.

The only excuse of why she lied to me is because she wanted to keep me around. She liked my company. She's a terrible person and I can't believe I trusted her.
