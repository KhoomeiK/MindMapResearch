I do agree with this, and I don't think I said anything against it in my comment. My point is that people can take the concept of skinny-fat too far at times, and I've seen plenty of instances of that both on and off of this sub. This spreads false information, which can freak people out, ED or no ED. People may not take it as far as I did, but they may for example start trying to diet down from a BMI of 22 because someone told them that it was still skinny-fat, even if they're perfectly healthy."
fatlogic,ffddz8a,t3_esnqnk,1579818875.0,"I get where this person is coming from. Warning: long-winded body dysmorphic rant ahead.

Body fat percentage is a tricky thing. There aren't super reliable ways to measure it that don't cost a lot of money. That uncertainty allows body dysmorphia to fill in the blanks.

For example: I got a bod pod scan done a while ago. Got 28.3% body fat, if I remember correctly. Looked up the margin of error, it was 1 - 2.7%. I assumed my body fat percentage was 31%, just to be safe. That's almost obese. I am skinny fat, and almost obese. Time to starve myself to get ""healthier"".

As per the post, hearing that a BMI of above 20 is unhealthy puts similar thoughts into my mind. I've heard things like that in this sub, and things like ""because of vanity sizing, anything above a size 2 is overweight"". As someone who cannot usually go smaller than a size 4 because of my hip structure, that kind of thinking has brought me down to a BMI of 17 in the past. And I still wasn't a size 2 then.

So, there are some legitimate points among the fatlogic. Skinnyfat is a real thing, but people can and do use the concept incorrectly and in a damaging way."

If your period is only once every three months, it might not be a bad idea to just take a week to eat at or slightly below maintenance. Your progress will stall slightly, but I've had very painful periods and it's not really worth making yourself even more miserable during them.

Also, if you are able to do so, skipping your periods entirely on birth control might be a good option for you. That's what I've done for the past five years, and it works wonderfully."
unpopularopinion,ff3885x,t1_ff37n38,1579536008.0,"Okay. So. First of all, the rule of thumb that I've heard (and googled to confirm) is that 2 drinks will usually bring you to the legal driving limit of 0.08 BAC. 

However, that's the legal driving limit. I've found that another drink past that, I am still relatively good at making decisions, though obviously a little impaired. I think you're exaggerating the effects of moderate drinking.

A pint affects me, but not enough to completely impair my ability to make decisions. It just slightly lowers my inhibitions. And before you accuse me of drinking constantly, I drink maybe once a month, if that."
changemyview,ff36ytn,t1_ff2zqx6,1579535167.0,"1. I think that's the norm, to feel relatively neutral about your gender. I don't really feel female at all, and I don't identify with stereotypical female gender roles, but I don't feel male either. Assuming that people don't treat me like a stereotypical woman, I'm perfectly fine with my gender. I think that holds true for most people. However, trans people feel gender dysphoria, in that their bodies do not match up with their brains, to put it in simple terms. For example, in a ftm trans person, they know that they should be a man. Having boobs causes gender dysphoria because they feel that they're not supposed to have them. It has nothing to do with gender roles, and everything to do with the brain and the rest of the body not matching up.
2. From the articles I've read on the subject, it seems that the answer is simply that transitioning physically is much easier and faster. Changing the mind takes years and years of therapy and emotional pain, while changing the body takes hormones and possibly surgery."

changemyview,ff23mmj,t3_er26jb,1579492895.0,"I agree with most of the other comments, but one thing jumps out at me: you seem to have never actually been in a relationship. 

Where are you getting this info? Reddit? TV? Reddit is full of immature teens and young adults, and TV/movies are intentionally overly dramatic. 

Let me tell you my personal experiences:

1. I have never had a major fight in any of my relationships. Disagreements, sure, but if both parties in the relationship are reasonably mature, then you won't have a lot of full-blown fights.
2. For the pet part: Don't enter a relationship who doesn't want to live with a lizard. Easy. Also, most people are okay with their SOs having platonic friends, I've never met anyone in real life who wasn't okay with that.
3. You can do both. I don't know why you're convinced that you can't spend time with a SO and also spend time doing things on your own.
4. This is true, and something I've also worried about. I play violin, am training for a triathlon, and enjoy reading and programming. My current SO works out with me sometimes, listens to me practice violin every day (or pretends to), and accepts when I want to go into introvert mode and read/code by myself. The right partner will give you plenty of time to pursue your hobbies, and will even encourage it.

Basically, from my experience, your worries about relationships are overblown. As long as you find a compatible, mature partner, these problems won't be much of a problem at all. Just don't settle for someone who doesn't respect your interests, hobbies, and preferences. I could just be good at avoiding dramatic and immature people, but most of my friends (and exes, and current SO) have been reasonable people who don't get into needless fights or demand all of my attention. Just find one of those reasonable people who respects your personality and hobbies, and you'll probably be okay."

I also love the fact that it lasts me 2 meals for less than $10. I make mine fairly healthy, so it's good for cheap-ish healthy-ish food.

Taco Bell, on the other hand, is my drunk/high/sadgirl food. I appreciate it equally, but it fulfills an entirely different purpose."

Everything about that show is unhealthy. It has absolutely no concept of moderation. I'm not one to say that dieting in general triggers eating disorders, but that show absolutely can, imo."
