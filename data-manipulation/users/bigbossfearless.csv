However, with all the #trashtag posts that got shared all over and the comparable news stories about groups of teens or boy scouts or veterans etc picking up trash in an area, I would argue that this is just as valid as any of those other news stories.

The fear is that people will start out by removing obviously bad stuff like Nazi and Klan rallies from protected speech categories, and that will set a legal precedent to remove protections of everyone else who's not a shithead.  Even legitimately fake news has to be protected or you risk empowering politicians to silence all criticism from journalists.

That's the erosion of Rights that the 2nd amendment nuts are worried about.  It starts with banning a single type of weapon or a caliber of ammo, and the slope gets real slippery from there.  ""We banned that other one already, so banning these three is just fine, too"" becomes a legal argument.  Pretty soon all the law abiding people have been completely disarmed, while criminals get to keep their guns because they just don't follow the laws anyway.

That's the big fear, at least.

There's an amendment (8th?) that prohibits the forced quartering of soldiers during peacetime, which just plain doesn't apply anymore but by God I will punch anyone who suggests it needs to be removed.  Because once we remove one amendment from the Bill of Rights, it sets a legal precedent to remove others."

I can't physically stop them but I desperately try to convince them not to fuck themselves up.  It rarely works.


Oh jeez I just remembered this great nightmare I had a while back.  Bear with me, because there's a lot of that ""dream logic"" here.  I was in a haunted house, it was very similar to The Haunting of Hill House where there was one specific room where the evil dwelled.  I was trapped, the evil spirit got a hold of me and I was being dragged by an unseen force towards the room that I knew would consume me.  As I'm being dragged down the hall I realized it's not the room itself but this elaborate rug that actually holds this evil spirit, and I'm holding onto the door frame for dear life and I manage to get my hands on a knife.  So I take the knife and I'm trying to carve a warning Into the wall so the next victim has a fighting chance, and that's when I realized...I have a fucking knife? 

So I let go.  And instead of fighting the pull, I just fly face first at this devil rug and I start stabbing the shit out of it, tearing it to shreds until the evil dissipates and I just rend that thing down to the fibers.  And then I realized I had all this spooky magic charged thread on hand now, and I sell off the magic threads (to whom, I don't know), and use the money to buy space ships and become a pirate king.

This is a pretty good recipe.  It's nothing special, and nothing too hard.  Introduces you to a few ingredients that you may not be familiar with.

Oyster sauce is a staple of Asian cooking, kind of like soy sauce.  You can find it in most supermarkets in the Asian foods section or near the soy sauce wherever they put it.  She says to chop up garlic cloves but for a total beginner like you, my advice is to get yourself a jar of crushed/diced garlic and just add a spoonful of that.  Way less work, fewer things to get wrong.

Oh!  Important safety tip.  When you're heating up oil real hot in a pan, do NOT do that with olive oil.  Olive oil is used at lower temperatures usually, and if you try to go crazy hot with it, it can catch fire and that's not cool.

From where you are now, this is the start of an endless, bitter war of attrition.  Success means outlasting your enemy.  You will not strike your enemy down in a blaze of glory, but wear it down like the rain erodes a mountain.  Grind and grind and grind until there's nothing left of you but scars and dust, and when you finally plant your flag in the ruins of what was, gaze out upon the battlefield and smile, for your wrath came like the wheels of Justice turning slow but true, and your will be done."

Now you're turning a 180 and telling me to go look at this bit, because this sliver right here tangentially supports your position.  Once you like the data, it's data again.  Until it's time for you to say it's not data anymore.  Either the data is reliable or there's a vast conspiracy that's corrupted it all.  Pick one and stick with it."

You had a real, honest to goodness chance to convert me over to your side and you just didn't pass muster.  The data, what little there was, was horseshit.  It's conjecture at best, insanity or outright fraud at worst.

Wow that is something else.  That's it, you got me.  I believe Tony.  Tony is obviously a better indicator than all the satellite data in the world.  If Tony says so, it's gotta be true.  Wow.  

Holy shit dude.  I can't even figure out what to feel about you.  You deeply horrify me.  I was willing to read that shit but wow, I wish I hadn't.  That is next level insanity.

environment,fewrroq,t1_fewqoqc,1579418522.0,"So...NASA has been changing all of the climate data for decades.  And the real data that proves this is gone.  Doesn't exist anywhere.  But you're sure that it exists.  Because a guy said so.  And he even moved to DC, but he still can't find it.  But it's definitely there.  And you know exactly what it says.  It says that nothing is warming, that everything is fine.  And you know that's what it says.  Because a guy said so.  Even though that guy has never seen the data either.  Because it doesn't exist.  Because NASA.


Honestly I don't know what to say to that.  Without any form of proof, you just believe this stuff?  And anyone with contrary data is just part of the conspiracy?  I'm guessing you're not into vaccines or a round Earth."

Given the incredibly vast numbers of different agencies, independent meteorologists, and climate scientists who report on this, it must take a truly monumental amount of tampering.  Who controls the tampering?  Is there an agency that decides what values will be substituted for the real data?  Is there some standard or do they just plug in whatever number they'd like to see?

Had him re-measure, asked him to fix it, and the following week they were even smaller.  ""This only size, sir, only size"" was what he said about the legs.  I'd been forced to pay in advance, because ""too much material sir"", so when he said the second draft was take it or leave it, I was fucked.  Wanted to do very bad things to that little fella."

But the other thing is something that I discovered, and that's having your shirts altered a bit.  Find a tailor and have them take the sleeves up, above your bicep.  You see, it's not really your torso that's lifting the shirt, it's your arms pulling the whole thing up with them.  The difference in comfort is just amazing when my biceps are free to move more, and shirts don't feel so tight around the shoulders anymore.  Before it was just awful."

environment,fewjjl1,t1_fewf7zr,1579411911.0,"It's an interesting read but despite making a lot of claims about the inaccuracy of all the data and models published by ""government scientists"", there's no suggestion as to an alternative, verifiable reason why the Earth is currently warming.  Ocean temperatures are verifiably rising, the great barrier reef is dead, fish populations are dwindling, droughts are getting more severe, almost every year for the past couple decades has been the hottest on record, and a continent is currently on fire.

The main issue I take with the refutations to anthropogenic climate change is that there is seldom anything offered to explain what else is causing the rapidly increased nastiness of our climate.  Responses tend to insist that nothing is wrong, with either no explanation for the symptoms we're seeing or an appeal to religion.  This article in particular claims that the sun is getting hotter, which would be its own kind of terrifying horror show, and that the extra heat is coming from the Earth's core because ""who knows what effects come from within?""  That's a quote from the article.  That's the explanation.  ""Who knows?""  

Now don't get me wrong, I accept some of what's being said here.  The carbon emissions aren't the sole culprit of climate change, it's a massively complex system that's dependent on a lot of variables.  However, many of those variables are being influenced by humans in demonstrable ways at rates hitherto undreamt of.  Yes, I really just used the phrase ""hitherto undreamt of"".   I'd be inclined to change my mind if anyone could point to a real and verifiable alternative.  Don't care if it's ancient aliens or even something weirder, as long as it can be proven.  Simply pointing to inaccuracies in existing models doesn't provide any useful explanation for what's happening.  It's the equivalent of pointing out a punctuation error (of which that blog had so very many) in someone's argument and claiming victory without actually saying anything of substance."
space,fewgbcr,t1_fewccu3,1579410107.0,"I guess I didn't really articulate the idea too well.  What I meant was that eventually the moon will be for sale, because as we expand outside of Earth that treaty will be invalidated.  Probably by China or Russia, who never think treaties apply to them anyway.  So someone will claim the land and then start selling it to billionaires and oligarchs, and the rest of the world will point to the piece of paper saying they can't do that, and that'll be ignored, and the practice will continue until everyone's well connected wealthy friends have their huge slices of mineral rich lunar land, and *then* the treaty will be officially declared obsolete.

At that point, regular people will be allowed to purchase from one of a handful of pre-selected holdings companies owned by those same assholes, and they'll charge an insanely marked up rate and suck more wealth out of the system.

And if by some miracle the land you bought happens to have great mineral wealth, it will be seized back by some government and given back to the oligarch you just bought it from, so that they can mine it through their illegally gained sole-bidder mining contract.

If you think little things like treaties or international laws matter to these people, just look at what happened Ukraine.  Oh, wait, sorry, officially nothing happened in Ukraine.  Nope, no Russians there.  Not one little Russian bear, no sir.  How about those concentration camps holding all the Uyghurs in China?  Nope, they don't exist either."
