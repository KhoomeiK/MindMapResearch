AWSCertifications,ffgifbk,t1_ffgh1gi,1579906953.0,Thanks so much Jon and I’m loving your exams and prep materials!   Do the developer requires you to know how to code? I’m still a beginner in JavaScript but I’d like to become a developer down the road.  Other than that I’m still on the fence where to specialize in AWS.  I was just curious if either cert  (SysOps or Dev) had a reputation for being easier than the other (assuming not much AWS hands on experience) so I’d start with that one.  Thanks man!
