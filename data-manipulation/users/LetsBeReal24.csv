AskWomen,fg05q6s,t3_ew6i1n,1580400802.0,"Honestly, when I was a teen it would make me feel bad about myself. Like THIS is what I attract?! It did not matter which gender they were. If I found them unappealing it messed with my head. Now that I'm an adult it doesn't bother me as much. As long as the person doesn't get creepy or disrespectful. I am able to ignore it and not embarrass either one of us."
relationship_advice,ffzwvhy,t3_ew3bqq,1580394977.0,"I'm sorry but this made me LOL! You are living in an extended movie love scene. Which doesn't translate when you want to idk go bowling or finish a puzzle lol. Just talk to her calmly, be specific about what YOU need in a quickie. You both have different definitions of what a quickie is, and that is a problem. 

Think about it this way, you spend over an hour on sex EVERY TIME. What other single thing do you spend that much time doing on a regular basis? Outside of work not much. You are not being unreasonable at all. Good Luck!"

dating_advice,ffxf1og,t3_evpeho,1580323833.0,"I would not date anyone my sibling had slept with. You sound very scattered and a bit immature. The time to tell Ben would have been before you slept together. Now it looks like a ""shameful secret"" Write it off, and be smarter next time if you really care about establishing a relationship without causing drama or tension in someones family."
AskWomen,ffqtrbi,t3_eup3zo,1580143451.0,"I get a lot of anxiety when it comes to work. I have literally only had stressful shitty jobs that pay nothing, but want to suck the life out of you. My last one (before the one I am at now) may have been the worst. Its hard to tell, but it did what other jobs did not. My other jobs  made me stressed and unhappy. This one made me stressed, unhappy, and insecure about my abilities. I was constantly nitpicked and gaslit when I complained. AWFUL. 

Today, I am in a balanced healthy workplace. And I hardly know how to act as I wait for the other shoe to drop. When I feel the anxiety sinking in I comfort myself with facts.

""Nothing bad has happened""

""Nothing bad has happened"" 

Even though it feels like I am drowning, I remind myself that literally nothing bad has happened YET. So I have to push through, and finish just one task to keep going."

AskWomen,ff9mpq0,t3_esezfj,1579716226.0,"I don't think the average person is mentally healthy or honest enough to be in a ""standard"" relationship let alone a poly one. The amount of maturity and transparency it would take is not for most people. And lets be honest, when we see poly relationship it is typically hetero with 1 man and multiple unsatisfied women. 

The concept doesn't bother me morally as long as everyone is a CONSENTING ADULT."

AskWomen,fen90g0,t3_epzyw2,1579279597.0,"I wear earrings everyday. My default is studs that go with everything.

Big necklace then I do small earrings. No necklace then the earrings can be huge, depending on the neckline of my clothes. At least one ring on each hand. I prefer gold jewelry since I feel it looks better on dark skin (which I have)."
dogs,fekrp99,t3_epemce,1579206216.0,"My dog gets swelling at the point of entry every time she gets her bordetella shots. It freaked me out at first, when it lasted for over two weeks. Vet said it was fine, but gave us an anti-inflammatory pill to speed up healing. A week of that and it was gone. You are not overreacting, we have to be super vigilant about our pets health. They cannot speak for themselves."
dogs,feknz0n,t3_epjpxx,1579204010.0,"I have a small shitzu mix, almost 4 years old. At times I do feel a bit guilty leaving her home. On those days I take her to daycare, or an extra long walk when I get home. But mostly I am fine. I am a ""single pet parent"" so all of her care is up to me. Luckily, she is a calm not super high energy dog. I know that I'm doing the best I can, and that the life she has is a million times better then the shelter I rescued her from."

dogs,fdczav8,t3_ekhivl,1578288830.0,"You aren't crazy. I have an 11lb dog who is super friendly and mostly oblivious to any dogs that mean her harm. Part of the reason I left my old apartment was because no one put their damn dog on a leash. Constantly running up to us. Once I had to kick a dog in the head (while holding my dog). I'm 5'2 and rather petite. Although an altercation with a human is what pushed me to get a glittery fanny pack & carry a knife, pepper spray, and taser on EVERY walk. I'm ready to do as much damage as I can to anything that means us harm. Do what you have to do! This world is insane."
