startrek,ffkoqj1,t3_etyn7a,1580026271.0,"Getting my gf to watch a modern Trek show that is like ~30 highly serialized episodes was easy. Convincing her we need to watch the entirety of TNG/VOY/DS9+the films to watch Picard is...hard. Thereís so much (great) filler that doesnít interest someone who just wants the main talking points for Picard. Thereís so many quirks and references to appreciate but itís...a lot.

Itís certainly a double edged sword. The fast pace and decent budget means we donít have to spend every waking second watching a TV show but you also miss out on all the little things that a longer toothed slower paced show could do."
startrek,ffkngk3,t3_eu1bi4,1580025654.0,"I watched TNG/VOY/DS9 and maybe a few episodes of TOS as a kid but I wouldnít have called myself a Trek fan until it was (re)ignited by the JJ films. I had kinda just forgotten about Trek. Plus when youíre watching TV as a kid back then you kinda just saw an episode or 2 every once in awhile and never in order. I never got to appreciate the full story arcs.

Streaming also helped since I can binge the shows whenever I want now, and may even be the stronger factor.

With how bad some Trek episodes are and some of the movies, I donít get the hate that the Abrams movies get. I think Into Darkness is slop but they canít all be winners."

The thing about watching old tv is you have to put yourself back in when it was new and accept it for what it is. TV has evolved and so has society, thereís going to be things that age badly but thereíre still good things to take away. You can imagine better special effects, grimace though the sexism and racism of the 60s, and enjoy some of the good stories theyíre telling. Despite the bad, Star Trek has always pushed boundaries.

worldnews,fdil97c,t1_fdidatc,1578445408.0,"Yeah...a lot of copy pasted comments just repeating the same catch phrases in support of Trump. Oddly multiple mentions of Obama, for whatever he has to do with Trump attacking Iran."
funny,fdikgdq,t1_fdib2uw,1578444902.0,"You don't agree that some people just want a job, to *live*? They have to reach for the top to be worthy of your grace?

They say the corporate world is out of touch with regular people. Go figure."
legostarwars,fdi6aea,t1_fdhz6bl,1578436485.0,It‚Äôs just the wings. That red trim and the shaping thanks to those new wedge plates are striking. Everything else about it is underwhelming and the price is absurd.
technology,fdi1zq3,t1_fdhxu2r,1578434308.0,Yup we might as well do away with voting for politicians. Let‚Äôs just let the corporations run everything. It‚Äôs all corruptible so why even try?

I made some minor cosmetic changes to mine but is basically the same as the original creator‚Äôs.

technology,fdhizpq,t1_fdhih4i,1578423656.0,"Because it turns out a good number of people, myself included, do still care about doing a good job and being productive, just not at the cost of their sanity and health. Considering my company is a billion dollar profit maker, I‚Äôd say being a lazy asshole is NOT the default human behavior despite all the anti-union rhetoric.

People say the same shit about UBI, like humans will just give up and society would die without working for pay. Humans have a drive in them to create and produce."
videos,fdhh2hx,t1_fdh6va8,1578422495.0,"When you consider how many people use their console for media now,  as Netflix boxes and even live TV, Microsoft was ahead of the curve. That E3 really ruined them, people were not ready to hear that and the Kinect stuff didn‚Äôt help."
