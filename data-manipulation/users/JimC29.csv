StockMarket,ffg7kd5,t3_etdrho,1579900165.0,Bring on the corrections. I've been paying to much for my index funds lately. I could use a 20%-30% of sale.
electricvehicles,ffg6ixl,t1_ffg6607,1579899520.0,I'm a Tesla shareholder who voted in favor of the merger. I'm doing just fine. That wasn't fraud it was a short term risk but the energy division is doing good now so it paid off.
electricvehicles,ffg5yd7,t1_fff1aof,1579899167.0,What government handouts every company gets the same number of tax credits? Tesla has used all theirs. Them and GM are the only 2 companies not getting anymore tax credits. They got a loan early on that they paid back with interest. Ford got a much larger loan under the same deal that they used to avoid bankruptcy. As for fraud they are delivering every car purchased so it cannot be fraud.

moderatepolitics,ffdyzhv,t1_ffdvoad,1579832440.0,Thanks for the starter comment. Since you are up on this issue why wasn't it brought up in the last election? I would think his opponent would have made it an issue.

Libertarian,ffcxsn7,t1_ffcvz5q,1579809489.0,I'm no fan of the left but at least they are honest about being for big government. The right only wants small government when they aren't in power.

economy,ffcvqjn,t3_estr05,1579808264.0,I buy stocks to hold for years and preferably the rest of my life. I'm tired of so many companies only concern with short term profits and hedge funds who want to cash out in 2-5 years time so they pressure the company to sacrifice the future for the present.
energy,ffcv5ev,t3_estwn5,1579807906.0,So it's 22 GWh of storage that's the most I've ever seen. Granted it's a decade away from being finished if it gets permits and financing. Which I expect it will. Having the transmission lines from the coal plant already there is a tremendous benefit in cost and permit process. Getting the right of way for transmission lines can take years. Thanks for posting this.
Libertarian,ffbro9h,t1_ffbr2aj,1579780102.0,Not really. It's super cheap to make heroin or methadone. The street cost is high because of the costs of a black market. Plus if someone commits a crime they can be removed from the program. That's a very big incentive for an addict to obey the law.
Frugal,ffbhz6a,t1_ffbhh74,1579766159.0,"I've never read or listened to him but this isn't the first time I've seen really bad advice from him.

Frugal,ffbhm5f,t1_ffbhh74,1579765679.0,That's is just really bad advice. You are losing a for sure 100% return. Plus when you add tax deduction it becomes much higher. Unless you owe money to a loan shark or payday lender NEVER LOSE COMPANY MATCH.

energy,ffbgjq7,t1_ffbg245,1579764316.0,Hydrogen has been used by refiners and to make other products like ammonia since the 1920s. And mixing it with methane is one of the main ways its sent through pipelines. You act like this is new. The only thing that is new is it starting to made out of renewables now but most of it is still made out of natural gas. It's easy to store but harder to ship.

Libertarian,ff9xotn,t3_esemvy,1579723758.0,Ending the drug war has been the most important issue for me since I could vote 3 decades ago. We have been seeing great progress at the state level on cannabis but until the federal laws are changed it can only go so far. The time is now.
Libertarian,ff9wdp0,t1_ff9vtjk,1579722958.0,Taxing negative externalities instead of income. And reducing regulations  I realize this is never going to raise as much money as income tax but that's a different issue. Just to give you 1 example some cities have started taxing sugary drinks and snacks. But they usually spend the money. In my utopia they would do that but use the money to eliminate tax on other groceries.

I would like to see our entire tax system change to a cost to society tax. I know that's not a popular opinion though. But I do agree if they put the tax too high it will force people to the black market. There was a proposal a couple of years ago with a tax that was around 20%. That is way too high on top of state taxes."
Libertarian,ff9rfh0,t1_ff9rbqc,1579719464.0,There are taxes on alcohol and tobacco. All I have ever wanted is cannabis to be treated the same way. Plus you can easily avoid the tax by growing it yourself.

Libertarian,ff9pn4e,t1_ff9lbz2,1579718136.0,What do you mean stay out of it. As the situation stands states and individuals are still violating federal laws. If interstate commerce was allowed the price would drop in the high states. You can't even own a gun today if you have a medical card or even if you smoke legally because of the federal law. Not to mention that it is forced to be a cash only business and so many jobs are forced by federal law to test for it. I really hope they don't over tax it but that is still better than the status quo. I know one of the current bills in committee has a 5% tax. I can live with that.

The consensus among [scientists](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economists](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) on [carbon pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price)^§ to mitigate climate change is similar to [the consensus among climatologists](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) that human activity is responsible for global warming. Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets the regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in tax](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)) and allows for a higher carbon price (which [is what matters for climate mitigation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S201000781840002X)) because [the public isn't willing to pay anywhere near what's needed otherwise](http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/Is-the-Public-Willing-to-Pay-to-Help-Fix-Climate-Change-.aspx). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own.

[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)).

Taxing carbon [is in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf), and [many nations have already started](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29687/9781464812927.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y), which [can have knock-on effects in other countries](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In poor countries, [taxing carbon is progressive even *before* considering smart revenue uses, because only the ""rich"" can afford fossil fuels](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) in the first place. We [won’t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG). Each year we delay costs [~$900 billion](https://cla.umn.edu/heller-hurwicz/news-events/news/policy-brief-calibrating-price-climate-risk).
 
[It's the smart thing to do](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069698910580), and the IPCC report made clear [pricing carbon is **necessary** if we want to meet our 1.5 ºC target](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf).

Contrary to [popular belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) the main barrier isn't lack of public support. But [we can't keep hoping others will solve this problem for us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility). *[We](https://i.redd.it/tomv8cnadxa11.jpg)* need to take the necessary steps to make this dream a reality:

§ The IPCC (AR5, WGIII) [Summary for Policymakers](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) states with ""high confidence"" that tax-based policies are effective at decoupling GHG emissions from GDP (see p. 28). [Ch. 15](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should. There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&rep=rep1&type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf).
