Nearly every trait that you consider to form a 'race' is polygenic, height, skin colour, face structure etc etc meaning that multiple genes contribute in a very complex way. So there isn't so much as an 'african gene' or a 'caucasian gene' that someone could target in your hypothetical weapon. There are consistent patterns yes, and in studies we often use the term 'of X descent' but there can be huge variations in thise groupings also.

I don't know how you would make a virus that targets a whole series of genes that produce +/- slightly less protein than the pattern of another 'race'."

A DAC is a digital-to-analogue converter and does just that, converts a digital signal (USB etc) to an analogue signal (3.5mm). Also not an absolute requirement unless you actually need/want one. What I think you are asking is do you need a DAC/AMP which is both combined and that's a yes if you want to get the best out of your headphones. Will it boost positional audio?
