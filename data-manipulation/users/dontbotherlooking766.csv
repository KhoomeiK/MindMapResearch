offmychest,fdjkt6u,t1_fdjksf2,1578475592.0,TBH I've never seen much of that show haha
offmychest,fdjkrmr,t1_fdjkqd2,1578475530.0,Yeah yeah whatever
offmychest,fdgfzg0,t1_fdgdhzk,1578395069.0,"You don't listen 

I have seen men mad at women for not being part of the draft. Takes like ""how dare those women have an opinion on literally anything when they don't have a draft like us""

My point is those men are stupid for being mad at women because women didn't make the draft rule and men did back then, so if they want to be mad then they can be mad at the men back then, not act like women are evil for something we didn't even make.

Which is why I hate men. So many of them are devoid of basic levels of logic that they get pissed at women over a rule women didn't make. Men are fucking stupid and it's sad. Fuck men because people with such poor levels of empathy, logic, and problem solving shouldn't be given a voice or a platform to speak on anymore."

offmychest,fdgd7eg,t1_fdg9o3s,1578391143.0,"I don't spend time on 4chan. This is shit I see on surface level internet. 

And yes, the only time men say anything positive about someone female is when they're talking about how they look. Most men just see women as commodities to their lives. So if left up to them we'd be slaves yeah."
offmychest,fdgd1cl,t1_fdgap48,1578390890.0,"It's not complaints about the draft it's complaints about women not having one. Men made the rule! Goes to show the intolerable, predictable chimp logic in 2/3rds of men.

Also yes women get maternity leave because they birthed a child just like how people who get surgery get a vacation. I understand this is wildly underestimated by entitled males but yes, having a baby is grounds for taking a break."
offmychest,fdgd06i,t1_fdg92ea,1578390840.0,Maybe if you guys could stop causing most crime for 2 seconds you wouldn't be so bad
insanepeoplefacebook,fdg8nyz,t1_fde40nb,1578384725.0,"Lol fuck you misogynist prick. You sure it has nothing to do with economics and how most single parents are in poorer areas where crime mostly occurs?  

Sad that girls can grow up normal without a parent but guys take it as an excuse to be evil crime causing pigs."

offmychest,fde3jr6,t1_fde33a8,1578330392.0,"Oh please, when has there been a time a man has achieved something and women ran in and said ""actually it doesn't count!"" And then criticized the guy for everything they can think of.  

And no one said all men are bad. Not all men are bad but almost all bad people are men. go figure.

I'm not gonna ignore shitty male behaviors just because it's not all of them."
offmychest,fde3d4p,t1_fde2n88,1578330273.0,"I'll translate;

Ooga booga. Only some men like woman when woman does something good. Some men hate woman when woman does something good. All men like woman when woman gives naked picture."
offmychest,fde2v69,t1_fde1ltj,1578329946.0,"Yes it is true. Most women hating I've seen is done by men. On here,FB, IG, and Twitter it's always men. Every time I see something good a woman has done I also predictably see tons of men discrediting it or calling the women ugly. Every single time. When the black hole picture surfaced there was entire posts about discrediting Bouman. 

Men have the same predictable reactions to any woman recieving a smidge of positive reception. Unless of course it's selling nudes. To be honest I think the whole ""it's only women that are mean to women"" was invented by men to hide the fact that is indeed men that are constantly tearing women down. Always."
insanepeoplefacebook,fde2bq1,t1_fde189c,1578329596.0,"Yes they are and there's tons of stats anyone can Google to back that. I highly doubt the amount of male and female rapists are even equal. You're delusional and clearly uncomfortable with the idea that your gender is mostly responsible for something bad.

insanepeoplefacebook,fde15gc,t1_fde0q7q,1578328830.0,Yeah but there is a trend. Most of the bad people are men. Most of the worst humans to have ever existed are men. There's a connection between being male and being a bad person that you can't deny when you guys spearhead all that is ugly and terrible on our Earth.
insanepeoplefacebook,fde04j0,t1_fddvzib,1578328149.0,"Then why are most rapists men. Just like how most violent crimes are caused by men. Clearly it's men who have an issue with human decency.

I think all little boys need an extra ""how not to be a piece of shit"" class in elementary schools."

FragileWhiteRedditor,fddym2u,t3_eksvx3,1578327132.0,"The fact that ""fresh facts"" is followed with an OkCupid blog link ....."
therewasanattempt,fddvn67,t1_fcvfd4i,1578325095.0,"Where have you seen any woman explicitly arguing for a draft for men only and not themselves.

I hear tons of men getting mad at women over drafting when I have,not once, seen any female opinion backing the draft as it is.

It's almost like men are so desperate to hate us that they just made up the idea that we supposedly want a draft for only men just so they have something to bitch about women about and further infantalize any issues we have. Like, I guess now we're not allowed to have opinions on abortion because drafting rules that were put in place by men years ago?"
therewasanattempt,fcv9tbk,t1_fcui8vh,1577997632.0,Women have served in wars and deserve a seat at the table during discussion. That's the point. No man in the history of human beings has ever been pregnant. Producing semen and carrying/birthing something is not 50/50 and if you think it is you're delusional
therewasanattempt,fcv9juq,t1_fcubrdc,1577997478.0,"Man can't get pregnant at all. Women can go into the military if they want to and have served, meanwhile no man in the world has ever gotten pregnant.

Apples and oranges."
therewasanattempt,fcv9egs,t1_fcudx63,1577997386.0,That's fine but that's A.) Not women's fault or doing AT ALL and B.) Not a reason to exclude women from military/military discussion.
offmychest,fcunnvv,t1_fctzwcg,1577984864.0,"I get what you're saying and I agree with it. I do think that's why many join and that's why I'm saying most are fake and shit. That custody case is interesting, and maybe you're right about there not being sufficient evidence, but I feel like the social issues with dads are at least palpable. 

But yes I think most MRA are just sexist men that don't actually care about solving any issues other than their biased personal ones"
offmychest,fctoj9v,t1_fctmgqr,1577951586.0,"There's a good handful, obviously mostly social. Keep in mind I'm American on the chance you aren't.

I mentioned the selective service which is horse shit. I know it's not really being ""used"", but men shouldn't be required to register for a draft. If you look back at the Vietnam war, it's very very sad and horrifying to think about. 

I also mentioned the paternal rights. Men are often given disproportional treatment socially and legally when it comes to their kids. They're not given an equal amount of parent leave, they're treated as inept or suspicious around children, and custody court is also notoriously difficult for men.

Mental health for men is also a trainwreck. It effects both genders and is a general problem, yes, but men are more prone and face a fairly specific stigma. I sure you've heard it before, but the ""suck it up"" mentality is still being preached to growing boys/men and is extremely regressive. A lot of traditional social expectations for men facilitate mental health issues. 

Those are my main three. But there's a lot of social bias men face. Yeah, every demographic has their own negative social biases they need to put up with, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth discussing. Men are more likely to be perceived as guilty. My brothers have literally had the cops called on them just for bumming around a store waiting for me to finish and they were 13 and 15 at the time. 

To me, those are actual issues. But off topic complaints are.. off topic complaints. People have complained about women giving out fake numbers on male activism subs. People have complained about women being able to sell nudes. Again, people complain a SHIT TON about women and dating. Those are off topic to me. Those are not urgent issues to be addressed and addressing them would barely help anyone, if it is even practical. Like what we're gonna make a law that women can't sell nudes or hand out fakes? How does that solve anything for men? It doesn't. It's just a complaint about XYZ thing women do.

Also insulting women and demonizing women (aka the endless talentless whore narrative) is not male activism. Does 0 to help male issues."

offmychest,fcs536x,t1_fcs3e5c,1577911582.0,I think if you have any real life friends or support stick with them. If not find something *in real life* to keep you occupied and gratified. Hobby or social even if it's something small.

I'd love to have an online friend throw a fit and cut me off because I went and had sex with someone who wasn't him. It really shows how rational he is and how genuine he is about our ""friendship"". I'd be glad to have a friend with such a childish, immature fixation on ""virginity"" to act like I'm a scumbag for losing something that is completely made up.  What a good friend. So good that he feels completely entitled to a relationship simply for being a good ""friend""

/s 

You deserve zero sympathy and support. You're acting like an immature little brat and I think it'd be best you escort yourself out of her life anyways because no one has time for little entitled insects like yourself. Your friendship was literally built on wanting her and now you're cutting her off cause you didn't get what you wanted and you have the gall to think you're a good ""friend"" for  that and deserving of pity? Holy shit get lost."
offmychest,fcs1izs,t3_ein23v,1577909993.0,Why do you feel the need to resort to violence just cause she doesn't want you? What you gonna shoot up the school too little prick? Cut her off and move on like an adult.
