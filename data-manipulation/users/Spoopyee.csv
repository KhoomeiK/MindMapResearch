AskReddit,fdjn0uf,t3_elqvo8,1578478813.0,Ok to put first I suffer from anxiety induced psychosis which is still s Strange experience. The strangest auditory hallucination I've had is having a friend's voice bring up and talk about some pretty personal problem. But just the sensation of having a voice you know as a hallucination can be pretty weird.
SuicideWatch,fdgdc5b,t3_el6rz7,1578391339.0,"Close to same age here 15M, had to deal with depression and anxiety all my life, recently diagnosed with psychosis and has had a lot of trauma. I don't know your perspective but I do know it's pretty shitty and it's honestly hard to make an attempt once your at a low peak, so if you want to my dms are open and we can try push through this together. I also wish you a happy for the time comes."
SuicideWatch,fdgd7ve,t3_el8fws,1578391162.0,"Refrain yourself from doing so please. Sleeping pills never work and you'll end up having to explain to everyone about it. That's the struggles of lots of people, is the fear and fact of knowing that lots of methods have a chance of fucking your life up more so it's better not to at all. my dms are open to anyone that wants to talk aswell"
SuicideWatch,fdgd479,t3_el7g0v,1578391009.0,"Very much so, I know that it's not P.C to think about it and I have others who don't like me thinking about it. But I just the temptations get there and actually planning everything and writing stuff out gives me large amounts of relief. I find it really helpful to vent out triggers and the amount my life has been fucked up aswell as a commeration to those who had try to help me in the past. It gets to the point where I now do it naturally because it works very efficiently as a venting system without me having to put my worry's on someone else. So at the end, I definetly do not feel happy thinking about it but gets large amount of relief and calmness doing so."
SuicideWatch,fdc7lku,t3_eki2s0,1578268666.0,Yeah too often. And then it really throws me down and I nearly reach the end when others don't understand and try to take that relief off you.
