I also tend to try and make the things he likes from scratch at home instead of buying them, like he likes breaded fried chicken and things like that, so I tend to make my own and use spray oil and bake them to try make them leaner etc. It is a mission though! haha

EatCheapAndHealthy,ffjc1uy,t3_etv8ak,1579995142.0,"CHRIST this is exactly like my partner. Does he like roasts and things like that? A way i get veg into my boyfriends food is by cooking it all into a sauce then blending it... don't laugh lol. Example is I do a slow cooked lamb dish, add onions, celery carrot tomatoes etc and once its all cooked down, I pick out the lamb (bore I know) blend the sauce, re add the lamb and he doesnt notice."
