depression,fe6h0wu,t3_enxvc0,1578890641.0,"Stop being depress for being lonely. Also,stay away from tech and social media bcos its giving us a false sense of validation or feels like some people keep messaging us ( false sense of busyness), its okay to not have a partner, learn to improve yourself and the right one will b attracted to ya. Also, dont try dating app cos it ruined me;)"
Anxiety,fe6guz9,t3_eny0nw,1578890499.0,"Hey, i also thought about it. Whats  the point of so many achievemnts when you feel empty and no one to share to, plus its difficult to attract the person with the sme energy and pasison and acheivement like us. 
But fret not, focus on yourself and the right one iwll be attracted to you. When you are in relationship, you feel its better to have many own time, instead of keeping up constantly updating your spouse.
Trust me  right one will come , and also dont use dating app ( it ruined me), and also stop being depressed for being alone. Cherish life. Life is great ;)"
depression,fe6gmir,t3_eny4we,1578890296.0,"Sorry to say, but if you say this to depressed peoplez you make them more depress. Stop trying to please depressed people, you know zero stuffs abt them, everybody has their hidden struggles. So, it means shit."
offmychest,fe6g99l,t3_enrwa2,1578889979.0,"Yes, to battle loneliness, i constantly please them, finding jokes, but I dont find people do the same to me. Tired of chasing pleasing people, now I choose to chase my self improvement and learn to love and embrace myself. Talk and understand myself more"
depression,fe121hv,t3_enl4i2,1578821613.0,"Breath.
Take a break.
Journal your thoughts, feelings . All the fckin damn time.
I did that. And i reflect on em everyday. Found em pointless and affected me.
Also, pray to God. Be grateful for what you have. Food drinks shelter whatever.
Calm down. Go infront of a mirror and reassure no one is killing me no one is harming me . Only my thoughts. Look Im so pretty handsome. I deserve to live.
Yeah thts how I cure mine;)"
mentalhealth,fe11sjz,t3_enl4lx,1578821502.0,"Meet along many people in your life and start figuring out how to strike up the first convo.
Trust me, you will get used to it.
I tried this many times too.
Example, if I see someone listening to music, just ask what type of music you like? I like music too.
Also, smile.
Somehow you get a hang of it.
Also, stop chasing people.
But only chase genuine true frens.
Trust me, you wont regret it.
Stop making frens for the sake of avoid being lonely"
Anxiety,fe11bnz,t3_enl87b,1578821378.0,"Same. I advise you to take a break, possibly a long one to figure out your thoughts and feelings. Journal em down. Thats what I did to heal. I reflect em back and feel they are pointless, anxiety and depression ruined my life. Take my advise, journal em down, you somehow felt life is slow moving and can do constant reflection ;) breath , inhale exhale, stay in the present, all you have is the now to amend the future. Stop worrying abt the future but grasp the present. Have faith in yourself and God and you shall heal."
depression,fe10rj2,t3_enl9ng,1578821237.0,"I figured out the best way to dep recovery is a strong shift in mindset by giving yourswlf some break to figure out your thoughts ,feelings and emotions.
I was more than blessed to figure out this way.
I couldnt see light in the darkness, felt worthless, constant anxiety depress nervous of anyrhing, fearful.

Anytime Im feeling worthless , or better off dead, i quickly go in front of the mirror and self assure no one is killing or harming me;)"

DecidingToBeBetter,fe0a5us,t3_enjh0u,1578807459.0,"Hey, Im 21 and i realized there are true and fake frens along my life
I realized i was making too many frens in uni, 
Wanna feel popular, and fear that once I graduated I m alone,
No one text me at my birthday, 
I deleted my notifs birthday in social media
And no one even text me at all,
Hey,

Perhaps you could do smtg not related to ur degree, like human resources? It might sound not suitable to you, but HR accepts ppl from many background.
There is always hope and opportunity. Life is worth living. 
From, someone who recovered from depression,
Who enjoy living now. Im not afraid anymore :)"
