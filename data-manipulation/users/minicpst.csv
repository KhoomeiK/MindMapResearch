Both of the long ones so far, I tried texting for help at some point (because who can think clearly during a scary seizure for the first, and for the second I texted my husband about an aura, then asked him to come down. I couldn’t reach for my phone. He didn’t read the text for several minutes). What is like is a dog to push an emergency button for me. That’ll alert 911 and my husband.

This, every five seconds, for 17 hours of travel. He did take a two hour nap somewhere in there. 

By the time we got to our hotel in Munich he was hoarse. It was hilarious. His brother meowed maybe a dozen times (fair), but he peed during our connection in Chicago and it went down my leg. Oh well.

When I got far enough across to see who was behind, I just smiled and waved a bit. The lady who honked actually put her hands up in apology. 

It was SO satisfying."

I’m sorry you’ve been uncontrolled this whole time. I was controlled and driving (mostly, took a few days here and there for dosage changes) since late May. But now they’re back. Seven since December 1. :( 

I hope you can find a combo of drugs that works for you. I’m on to combo/drug five as of last night. 

And, another hundred pounds off of your frame and think of the places you can go!  But if too much exertion is a trigger, go carefully. Sounds like you have that under control."

But mostly I wanted to say, you too?  

I’m 42, and developed epilepsy just over a year ago. 

Sucks, but I walk a lot now. Which is good exercise. I love in a place with a walk score of 0 or 1. Even getting my daughter to school is an automatic 1.5 miles because of where the bus stops are located. 

That and the drugs helped me lose 55 pounds. I just wasn’t hungry. 

I hope yours is controlled and driving is in your future again."

Are you photosensitive?"
Epilepsy,fdjaus3,t1_fdj77ss,1578463623.0,"My doctor (regular, not neuro) talked about that today. But my neuro said that to do true keto you have to be in the hospital so they can test for keto acidosis. And a lazy keto has had mixed results. Add to that that I’m a vegetarian and it makes it very tough. 

I’m not against to it, just both doctors agreed it’s not very likely to do anything. 

I’m also about as light as anyone wants me to be, and keto usually has weight loss. Too much lower (BMI I can go down another 15-20 pounds, but as I’m in really good shape and work out and am fairly muscular, I’m already in a size 0) and people are going to think I have cancer. 

Pot is another one recommended often. It’s legal in our state, but I’m not messing with it without my neuro’s ok. Plus, I’d like to keep my 42 year streak of being marijuana free going. :)"
Epilepsy,fdivgga,t1_fdir8e7,1578451939.0,"Totally get it. It IS funny. 

I’m having a lousy month with mine (and I don’t get fun brain waves on an EEG, I seized during my last one and they said it didn’t show up. I knew it wouldn’t). 

For my humor, people have noticed I lost over 50 pounds (and I’m only 5’1”, but I had extra padding before), so I tell them epilepsy is a great weight loss diet!  You have to walk everywhere, the drugs make you not hungry, so as long as you don’t mind the shakes it’s awesome!"
Epilepsy,fdiv4eq,t1_fdipvir,1578451723.0,"I got diagnosed easily, thank goodness. October 1, 2018 was my first seizure. November 6, 2018 was my diagnosis. 

That’s when we tried the lamictal, but about eight days later there was a rash. So nada. 

Then after my VEEG in the hospital in December we started topamax. It worked ok, but by the end of January 2019 the auras were back. So we added oxcarbazepine. I kept having to up the dosages, but those stayed my meds. But I started to realize I was having hallucinations and delusions, and I was having to up the dosage every two months. So no more topamax. That was December 3, 2019. Weaned off of that by the new year, but started clobazam the same day I started weaning. That hadn’t worked at all say my seven seizures (including a nine minute one on Sunday). Today I’m starting to wean off of clobazam, and I’m starting lyrica tonight. 

Wheeeeeeeee."
funny,fdipe5h,t3_elj6kh,1578448059.0,"Much better than my daughter, but not funnier. 

She was the flower girl for my brother’s wedding. She threw out the petals so early, around a turn, so most people couldn’t see she’d done any. 

As she gets closer to the front my mom mimed throwing out the petals. My daughter nodded. Then a few steps later my mom says from the front row, “throw the petals out!”  

My daughter, then four, stares at my mom, takes the basket, and turns it over with the biggest, “I KNOW!  It’s empty already, Grandma bitch!” look you’ve ever seen on a four year old’s face.  The photographer happened to get that moment of the front row absolutely doubled over with laughter. It’s actually a great picture.

Sorry, annoyed a bit because I’m starting drug number four today, hoping to find a combo. Was only on number three a month. 

Oh, guess they’re numbers four and five. Had a lamictal rash, so that was technically number one.

I’m not super concerned, but that’s partly because I take precautions. 

Lots of bears in Bellevue. Lots of trails in Bellevue. Lots of hungry mamas and cubs in Bellevue in the spring. 

But, you’re right. I must be a liar. 

Can’t tell if you’re joking or not, but it certainly came across as not. I’m many things, but a liar is not one. 

I’ll go take off my precautions from the other bag (not using them now because the bears are asleep) because of your say so. Would that make you feel better?  Because a 5’1” 120 pound woman feels better with them on?

Peace out dude. You do you. I won’t criticize or call you a liar for it. 

I also wear a body camera. Why?  Because I’ve been approached by people who wanted to rape me. And it makes me feel better.

If you ever sleep with someone and watch them for hours (my kids used to sleep with me) you'll see them wake, look at you, and go back to sleep.  That's what the FitBit is picking up.

Here's mine.  I don't have nocturnal seizures.  I always wake for mine.  If you wanted to see mine, you'd have to look at my heart rate.  You can see the spike the other day when I had mine.  My resting heartrate is in the 50s, and while I'm laying seizing, it's in the 80s-100s, and has peaked at 120.

Edit. Here was last night. You can see, according to this I was up for several minutes at once. Either my watch is wrong or I just don’t remember. 

But this also added in the benchmarks for my age group, and what other women average out. 

https://imgur.com/a/Kg77BbK No idea why it asked me if I’m over 18. It’s just a Fitbit screenshot.

Here’s my heart rate. No seizures. The spike is when I woke up, so that’s fine. Heart rate in the mid to low 40s most of the night, 50s the rest. Clearly no seizure.
