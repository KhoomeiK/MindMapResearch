malehairadvice,ffee1oj,t3_esyrki,1579844559.0,I took this exact picture to my barber. Turns out it doesnt work with my hair. Looks fucking great on you though man. 10/10
SubredditDrama,ffcgntk,t1_ffcfhh5,1579799055.0,"While I understand your argument, I disagree. She lost because the popular vote does not determine the president. Saying she won wont change that fact. And it will be cold comfort if the next Democrat ""wins""."
gamernews,ffabsgk,t1_ffa84vd,1579731830.0,Lmao. Cool deal chief. Take care.
gamernews,ff9rpic,t1_ff9qzf4,1579719681.0,"I could not care less about Bungie. I do not buy their games anyways. 

Also, ""virtue signaling"" is such a lame buzz term. Perhaps, and go with me here, maybe, ***I'm just sharing my opinion***. You dont need to get offended."
gamernews,ff9q7dx,t1_ff9phm6,1579718526.0,"I agree that is ludicrous to compare the two, which is why I never did so. I think you are the one making the comparison. 

On that note though, working in a sweatshop is a far cry from sex slavery too... but that doesnt mean we shouldnt want to help people in sweatshops because there is something worse out there in the world. 

Personally, after hearing about the practices that some people were working under for RDR2, it really turned me off. And while no, that is not a sweatshop, it doesnt mean it isn't bad. And again, as someone who plays games, I would appreciate it if they were afforded a proper work life balance."
gamernews,ff9osvh,t1_ff9ommc,1579717522.0,"I dont own Destiny, and for the most part I do avoid those companies. Obviously not always, but I do my best. 

Also, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just making my point. I dont think it's wrong for me to ask people not be treated like shit just to make some silly games."
gamernews,ff9oam1,t1_ff9n1ri,1579717170.0,"I dont think, as a person who plays games, that I want people to have to suffer to make the things I enjoy. In fact, it is about as far away from a requirement as you can get. I would even say I would absolutely rather the opposite be true. 

This is less about our expectation and more the expectations given by management to finish in time based on money concerns."
RedLetterMedia,ff9nu6a,t1_ff9lgov,1579716894.0,Go to sleep little baby...

pics,ff9evfl,t1_ff99ipw,1579711515.0,What a stupid age I am!
todayilearned,ff99kri,t1_ff97b2z,1579707974.0,Oh man I laughed too hard at this! I do this with Crusader Kings and EU. I'm pretty sure I could have worked as a geography professor.
