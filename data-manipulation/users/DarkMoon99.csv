Not American, but I think there are many people on reddit who use the type of argument you have.

Edit:
Additionally, as a non-American Christian, I really don't like the fact that people use the American Christian as their example of the standard Christian. More than 90% of Christians live outside America.


Edit2:
What's also ironic, is that I made a comment saying I think the general trend of reddit is strongly left leaning, and you immediately responded with identity politics.

I also like the fact that most Christians on the sub are willing to openly talk about topics that would often be considered distasteful (or even, a sign of a lack of faith).

For example, there have been discussions here about the fact that - God killed Himself to save us from Himself.

I am a pretty strong Christian, but that is something that has always bugged me.

God made Satan, and gave us the potential to choose a fallen nature. He then let Satan convince us to try falling (""Come on, just try it once...""), and then tells us that we are condemned to hell for this... but He has a plan to save us. He will kill Himself to save us from Himself, so that we can be with Himself, for eternity.

Not American, but I think there are many people on reddit who use the type of argument you have. For example, a post could have 95 comments in direction x, and 5 comments in direction y, and someone will post a comment saying something like ~ this post is getting brigaded with people pushing type y comments.


Edit:
Additionally, as a non-American Christian, I really don't like the fact that people use the American Christian as their example of the standard Christian. More than 90% of Christians live outside America.


Edit2:
What's also ironic, is that I made a comment saying I think the general trend of reddit is strongly left leaning, and you immediately responded with identity politics.


I feel that is also one of the problems with this sub - left wing identity politics and the associated tribalism that goes with it, has strongly infiltrated this sub.


Identity politics and tribalism is all over posts in this sub these days."

I also like the fact that most Christians on the sub are willing to openly talk about topics that would often be considered distasteful (or even, a sign of a lack of faith).

For example, there have been discussions here about the fact that - God killed Himself to save us from Himself.

I am a pretty strong Christian, but that is something that has always bugged me.

God made Satan, and gave us the potential to choose a fallen nature. He then let Satan convince us to try falling (""Come on, just try it once...""), and then tells us that we are condemned to hell for this... but He has a plan to save us. He will kill Himself to save us from Himself, so that we can be with Himself, for eternity.

I mean, God owes me nothing, so I am grateful that I can go to heaven, but at the same time, I'm also cynical in my thanks because this is all His fault anyway. He is the origin."
