It is a scientific fact that a fetus from 4-6 weeks has the beginnings of a nervous system. Therefor, it may be a subject. 

This is all based in the fact that a fetus from 4-6 weeks has the beginnings of nervous system. From that, I extrapolate that a fetus from 4-6 weeks onward may be capable of experience.

You on the other hand, make the claim “that a fetus is just a clump of cells with no experience.” You have given no evidence to this claim,scientific or otherwise, and yet, you still claim I’m the one who bases my view points on “a gut feeling instead of science.” Saying I have no evidence without showing how is not an argument."

SocialistRA,fec6gr4,t1_feamw6j,1578967444.0,"This ignores all the reasons why people could be “pro life” besides wanting to control women’s bodies. I personally am pro life, because after around 5-6 weeks, the baby develops a nervous system, and therefor it’s important to at least consider treating it like a person. Its true that this being lacks many faculties of a full grown human being. So dose a newborn. So dose a toddler. It’s a moral grey area so I tend to lean towards what will not possibly result in murdering another sentient being.

My position on this issue is guided by the same principal that makes me anti fascist. White supremacists don’t hold “white people are more important then black People.” They hold that “whiteness is more important then personhood.” Facisim is the ultimate insult to the dignity of the human person.

I mean, what she did is make one poorly worded tweet (which she has clarified) and invite a guy who DARES to be called 1 thing rather then another thing, but sure. Maybe around 10% of the cancelers are genuinely concerned about what Nat said, and are actually bothering to watch her video on none binary people and her canceling. But you know what, I don’t think the other 90% are complete fucking morons. 
All of the criticism I could find was either people who clearly have not done there research, and people who already had an axe to grind. 
What happens seems pretty clear to me. Nattily is a pretty independent thinking person. Because of that, her views sometimes are critical of the left. And it turns out, people on the far ends of the political spectrum (yes, both sides) tend not to like it when people ask uncomfortable questions (centrists and moderates have there own issues.)

Okay, so you have a bunch of people who don’t like Contrapoints, and then they get it. At first, it’s just a tweet. Then Buck angel reads a voice line, and says he thinks of himself as “Transexual” instead of “Transgender.” For those who think this might genuinely think this is damning evidence, “I’m bisexual, not pansexual” “OH MY GOD, DO YOU HATE PANSEXUAL PEOPLE!” No, I just don’t use that term for myself. But most people don’t think to hard about it. All it takes is seeing other people be concerned about how “problematic” Contra is, and then, canceled.

3rd: Introverted Feeling (Fi): Deals with strong values, based in there own feelings, isolated from the feelings of others. ISTJs generally aren’t supper adept at reading there own feelings, but there internal emotions and value judgments are very important to them. 

4th: Extroverted Intuition (Ne): This deals with finding connection between new ideas, and finding new possibilities. The ISTJ is often suspicious of this function, when it involves contradicting the structure givin by there model of the world built up by Introverted Senseing and/or Extroverted Thinking. 


ISTP

1st: Introverted Thinking(Ti): This deals logical systems based in internal standards. Rather then considering there thinking in relation to other systems of thought(Te), ISTPs consider the measure of an argument or system of thought primarily by its internal consistency.

2nd Extroverted Sensing(Se): This deals with external observations of the world, not in terms of the subjective impressions they leave (Si) but just in terms of what is there, disconnected from any symbolism or personal significance those ideas might have.

3rd: Introverted Intuition(Ni): This deals with take the information taken in by Se, and looking for patterns in that information. Someone with higher Ni (INXJ) might look for patterns in thought it’s self, but ISXPs tend not to.

4th: Extroverted Feeling (Fe): ISTPs tend not to be able to separate how there feeling from the general mood of those around them. However, they will generally not spend a lot of effort trying to fine tune that atmosphere. Instead, ISTPs tend to either try and pretend like there indifferent to other people’s feelings (they aren’t) or else try and simply not bother others enough to get buy without be bothered to much over offending someone."
