Have someone (either r/resumes or IRL) go over your resume and see what you could change to increase your chances. Find someone to practice interviews with if you need to. Consider grabbing a seasonal job in a tourist town if you  need to. I know most ski towns have many more job openings than people to fill them. And totally call the suicide prevention hotline. You have to be alive for things to get better."

And it has the dilution guide for different cleaning uses right on the bottle. Also the odd small gift for little kids, cheap spices, coloring books.

Man, I wish there were one anywhere near me."
povertyfinance,fefjeln,t1_fefcjza,1579057574.0,"Mine don't. They are either seasonal jobs or, at best, not corporate-type things. You are on your own for the move. I'm not ""valuable"" enough for paid moves."
povertyfinance,fefbyzw,t1_fef3nsf,1579052985.0,"Not the toilet, but my new jobs are usually on the other end of the country. Or a different one. It's expensive."
povertyfinance,feeznoc,t1_fedlbc1,1579044756.0,"Think more ""toilet exploded"" if you don't have a car. Or ""New job is on other side of the country""."
todayilearned,fd7hk4f,t1_fd5b2no,1578204622.0,That was with my full 30 cents from last month. I live in a tiny middle of nowhere place that is entirely overrun with tourists 10-11.5 months a year.
todayilearned,fd7h3f2,t1_fd4vset,1578204408.0,I have 85 octane available because I live at roughly 3000m above sea level. A few of the western mountain states have it.
todayilearned,fd42ges,t1_fd3yvlm,1578163753.0,Where is gas that cheap? I can’t even get 85 for less than $2.60
povertyfinance,fcr7ebj,t1_fcqiara,1577897852.0,If you work the resorts you get your ski pass on your employee ID. And also you can get on local free and trade lists to collect equipment. With a bit of local networking you can get totally outfitted with functional gear for next to nothing.
povertyfinance,fcobyte,t3_ei5dev,1577828515.0,"Most ski resorts are hiring right now. They usually have housing and overtime available. You can move in for just the rent deposit. You'd have to wait the two weeks to get your first pay, unless you can wait tables. It'd get you through the winter, give you something interesting to talk about in your ""real job"" interviews, and if you don't go crazy with booze and weed, you'd have a small chunk of cash at the end. And then if you're not totally incompetent you can snag a summer job, too. Also while you're in the mountains, you can talk to people in the area for possible jobs in your degree area. 

Start at [coolworks.com](https://coolworks.com) or just google vail resorts jobs. Copper pays better, I think, but Vail, Breck, or even Aspen will have more resources for free/reduced cost services in town."
AmItheAsshole,f8us9l7,t1_f8u5hzl,1574841686.0,But I bet they’d accept them. Mine doesn’t NEED to ride in the car every time I go somewhere but bet your ass he’s at the door looking sad any time I’m not in my work uniform.
