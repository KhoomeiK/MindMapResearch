Watches,fffolej,t1_fff46j5,1579888421.0,"Just my two cents; the Tank is the quintessential dress watch, while the Santos is a perfect balance between sporty and dressy, so I’d say it depends on which suits your style more. Just get the one you feel more attracted to, I personally prefer the Santos over the Tank, and plan on getting the new blue dial one within the year. Both are iconic watches so it’s a win either way."
unOrdinary,ffdbcyu,t1_ffaxw8h,1579817223.0,"Ah yes the power of plot armour; beating someone who’s had years of experience practicing and fighting people with powers with only his skill of hand to hand combat, by training for a few months with low tiers who know jack shit about fighting.

Sera getting her ass handed to her would be super satisfying considering how she beat the absolute crap out of a John who wasn’t even fighting back lmao"

If Bron Jr. isn’t even half as good as Bron, consider the hype dead. And by the time LeBron retires, Giannis and Luka will be well in their primes to contend with Zion."

Watches,ff71hru,t1_ff0f8tr,1579639253.0,"Damn was in the same situation, deciding between the Santos Blue dial or the DJ 41 Blue dial. But I’ve absolutely fallen for the Santos! Gonna get it in a few months, the Santos gets my vote!"
todayilearned,ff24tde,t1_ff22c56,1579493827.0,"No, you’re missing the point, I believe you don’t understand. The person I replied to was making a point about how a former owner having access doesn’t mean he can just waltz in, whether it’s from the trespasser’s or the new owner’s perspective is completely irrelevant as the point remains the same; the previous owner can’t just waltz in.

My point is that in situations like those where it happens, the owner is also partly responsible for not having taken the proper security measures to protect himself."
todayilearned,ff1pt7u,t1_ff1n4em,1579483492.0,"No, it's being responsible for yourself and your belongings. I do take back that it's just on the new owners, however it is still partly on them, as they are adding a layer of risk by not changing locks when someone could potentially access their home. If you don't want to risk endangering yourself or your property, at least do the minimum to protect yourself."
todayilearned,ff1opay,t1_ff1i7s9,1579482790.0,"You missed the point. Who cares what happens to the trespasser, the first thing you should be thinking about is the safety of your family or belongings. This is about protecting yourself by taking the steps needed to ensure your safety. It's not completely on the new owners, I take back, but it's still partly on them as it is a risk that can easily be removed by changing or adding locks."
todayilearned,fezwisr,t1_fezrnyy,1579462577.0,"Just like in that situation you used, yes that’s on the new owners for not taking the proper steps to ensure the safety of their house. 

This isn’t about what’s right/wrong legally or morally, this is about taking obvious steps to avoid putting yourself in situations where you can be abused."
