What I had in mind was something like when we trap electrons in a magnetic field, and they keep rotating there. Or when you use a laser to trap some atoms. Is that magnetic field technically a circular mirror for electrons to bounce between? 

OK, now imagine a laser except without mirrors, there's something like that magnetic field but for photons. A curved space-time for example can do that."
AskPhysics,fg3i0dr,t1_fg2ub5i,1580482011.0,"No, a laser is continously creating photons that are in phase and coherent. What I'm asking is like when you have a particle accelerator that keeps building up the particles in the beam and then can shoot it out. except now it's photons."

MuslimLounge,ffudfht,t3_ev8soi,1580239631.0,"All of the replies are good. But I think it varies from one person to another.
For me: be conscious about procrastination, and set a goal for your day, or next hour, try to reach that goal. Also, things that you can do in 5 or 10 minutes, do them right away.
Another thing is, procrastination is about your brain's reward system. When you procrastinate, your brain releases dopamine (reward hormone) and you keep procrastinating because you get used to it. You can break this cycle by doing other smaller tasks that give your brain that reward, and start planning based on that.
