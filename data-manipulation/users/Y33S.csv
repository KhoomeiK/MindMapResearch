Advice,fd9b459,t3_ekagek,1578231007.0,"Check her into a hospital for her suicidal thoughts. You’re being emotionally blackmailed, so remove yourself from the equation. If she’s in the hospital with the threat of suicide, she will be closely monitored. Also, she’s most likely saying it’s your fault because she wants you to continue being emotionally invested in her, and to be constantly in your thoughts. Make her believe that you don’t care anymore. Tell her that after you check her into the hospital, you are going to block her and won’t deal with her anymore. I would recommend using phrases like “I won’t deal with you anymore” to further de-personalize the situation. Good luck, bro"
