I turn off all the lights in my room so that only the light from my PC being on lets me see my shadow on my closet doors.

I vape and just have fun with it.  At first, it was weird, being disgusted about everything you hate about yourself as presented by your shadow, but slowly, my shadow has taken a shape I'm comfortable with.  I lost weight, and gained muscle.  My shadow doesn't bother me as much anymore."

I was sitting in the break room of my workplace when all the managers and leads came out of their conference room.  One lead that I had worked with but had never payed attention to me suddenly took a look at me and was kinda shocked that it was me.  Wow, that looks nice she said.  That's all it took.  

While she is absolutely beautiful, I don't have any ideas or hopes on her ever liking me, but she did start something in me.  It was just a compliment, but it made me think, well, I must be on the right track.

My CT co-workers each have their own good and bad traits.  Like we have 2 CT that been there for more than 10 and they do the job but they just don't care, and they are awesome.  We have 2 that don't really care and sometimes refuse to do clean ups but again, it's fine.  I'll do it, I don't care, they are still cool in their own ways.  Then we have a CT that his whole shift he will mostly just go outside and get carts, when he's there we all know we can focus on everything inside and the carts will be taken care of.  Then it's me and my brother who do the restrooms and trash the most.

I really like my coworkers, we tend to not take our lunches together because there has to be one CT available but when we do it's a treat.  

Even as I'm cleaning shit up, others even ETLs are making conversation and helping me by either standing and directing traffic or actually lending a hand.  I tell them they don't have to but they are nice.  Lol.

You can use it to be lazy and drown your problems away with food.

Or you can use it and be productive.  Take walks, go for runs, exercise.  I can't stress that enough.  MJ makes you deal with your problems and can show you on your body what aches and what you can work on.

It can also help you feel muscles that weren't there before by concentrating on them both physically and mentally.  

Weed can be addicting, specially if you let the mindset in that you have to be high to enjoy life.  While it can have that effect, you can also learn to live without it.  But with Vapes being a thing, the stigma related to the smell of weed is non-existent for me at least and that helps a lot."

I had bought the 4th game before playing the first 3, and the Hashirama and Madara fight sold me right from the start, bought the Boruto exp dlc and then later on just bought the whole Legacy.

Completing the 4th game actually made me finish the Naruto series, I had stopped watching it when Naruto fought Pain and defeated him.
