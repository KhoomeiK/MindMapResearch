minnesota,ffaw1ig,t1_ff8mcqf,1579745805.0,"Yes, I love going to live shows. My favorite concerts so far have been the ones where they booked at the small venues like the Garage in Burnsville, The Myth in Maplewood, or the caboose out in Minneapolis. The caboose is awesome because it's literally a couple feet off the light rail  so it's super easy to get to without having to drive. I saw Escape the fate, Atilla, and As it Remains play out there. And we're apparently home for Sleep Signals, which is cool because I had listened to them before and never knew until they were added on as an opening act and said they were based out of Minneapolis."

And I kept getting sick from how hot and humid(the extreme humidity triggered my asthma)  it was, I got sunburned a lot even without going outside sometimes (and I'm a darker skinned hispanic)  plus  I got Montezuma's revenge multiple times a year. 

 I saw my fair share of giant cockroaches just in the street, tarantulas, jumping spiders, and other way to large and hairy  spiders. As well as, there's mosquitos there YEAR ROUND, and for some reason they love biting me, plus I think I'm allergic to some of them since sometimes my bites would swell up to golf ball sized bumps.

Also, our public transportation is way better than most other states. There wasn't a bus  available at all except in really big cities in Texas.

That and my parents were narcs, and I was the scapegoat, so I've never trusted them fully that much. My brother does though, he is oblivious to what they do, because they constantly tell him lies about me (even now that I'm an adult and barely see them anymore)  And I'm sure OP's parents did the same."

I think you would need to sit them where you want them to go and coax them with food and they would probably do it for the food, The little gluttons  XD

They also get bored of their food easy so they need to be served different kinds each day, or else they might refuse to eat, or try to eat a littler one (there was only 1 that tried to do that once he seemed kinda aggressive though and got his own tank eventually)"

My mom kind of  was too. I didn't have to worship her or anything like my dad, but she didn't care how I was either. Neither of them ever praised me though. A couple of times as a kid, when I still cared about making them proud, I tried to ask my mom why she never said I did a good job, or that she was proud of me, and she told me ""You're naturally good at school, and your brother isn't as much, so we don't think we should praise you as much""

raisedbynarcissists,fecmhke,t3_eo1q0b,1578977577.0,"Once I got to be a teen and started to wake up to how my parents are and actually managed to get a little social interaction, I realised a couple things. I think the biggest 2 are that it's not normal to never cry. Ever since I was a kid, I wasn't allowed to ever cry. If I did, even if it was because they were paddling/spanking/ or hit me etc, I couldn't cry or else they'd paddle or belt me until I stopped. So as I got older, I always got really bad anxiety when I felt I needed to cry to the point of throwing up and sometimes triggering  an asthma attack. 

The other is that I'm an extremely, abnormally non-talkative person. It's not that I don't like to speak with people, but I find that what I think of as a casual conversation is very different than what most people think of. And I come off as aloof or uninterested, because of being quiet, even though I might feel like I spoke a lot. But sometimes it's frustrating because as a kid, I grew up having to be seen and not heard. My parents immediately told me to shut up if I tried to speak to them unless they were initiating conversation, so I didn't speak much. I also find that I have a slight stutter  now if I'm not careful and lose my voice easily. 

I feel I've made a lot of progress though and can present myself mostly normally. Back when I was 15-18, I was actually allowed to do things like, talk to the people working when we went to stores and order for myself at restaurants. At first it was really awkward and my parents would yell at me for being too quiet, but now I can manage just fine. I'm just soft spoken.

Edit: sorry about the text block. I'm on mobile and i couldn't get it to stay split up more"

But our cat loved to go for walks outside, so we took him out like a dog but he was otherwise an indoor cat. I think it's the best of both worlds, they don't mess up the local fauna and the cat gets to play outdoors, get lots of exercise and stay safe.  He just hated the feeling of grass in his paws though, so we had to stick to sidewalks."
