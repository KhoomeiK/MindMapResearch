AskReddit,fed7adu,t1_fed6tgg,1579002223.0,"Wanted to enjoy the good life without putting in work. Yeah, that's how my brother is. Shortly after marriage he bought an expensive car (lost that too, over 19% interest rate), stayed in a luxury apartment 45 minutes away from us, spent alot on furniture using his new wife's credit (ended up buying it pennies to the dollar from him just so he could afford to leave and move out of state). Not sure how to help anymore, or what to do. Just kinda have to stand back and hope for the best. Just hard to once hes burned you, and many of the family members. 
Another story, when I was 18, and found out he had burned through my credit by stealing my SSN, I went snooping through his room, and found a printed copy of the SSNs of my dad, mom, 2 brothers and little sister in his room. He was planning on doing the same to theirs as he did mine. I destroyed the copy, notified my dad to move them to a new location, and secure it. Brother found new location, but ended up taking $3k my dad left as bait. My dad said he'd rather him take that then ruin the credit of my little brother and sister. I agree, because after that he didn't mess with anything anymore up until after he moved out."

AskReddit,fecfgqf,t3_eodtd1,1578972651.0,"My brother. He introduced us to porn when my other brother and I were 10 and 8. Drinking when we were 14 and 16. Dropped out 2 months before high school graduation. Got GED, went to med school, dropped out 3 months after, in debt. Started a business off of my dad's, burned through my dad's contacts and ruined relationships.  Ran 2 businesses into the dirt. Hooked up with a married woman and tried to get her to divorce her husband, became attached to her children, but ended up leaving them after giving them hope. From his teen years to now, hes hooked on weed, but laced with other things. His mind is fried, we tried to help him. When I proposed to my now wife, he proposed to his girlfriend and made it a competition. He got married 4 months before I did, rushed into it, bailed on my wedding day, stole my SSN, ruined my credit. He has 2 kids now, but has been toying with divorce and his wife married him because she thought he owned my dad's company. So it's a mess, he burned through 3 more companies, and owes a few people over $20k-$50k from business dealings. Poor kids have to deal with that."
