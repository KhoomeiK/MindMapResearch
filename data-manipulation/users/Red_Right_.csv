BlackPeopleTwitter,fein97p,t1_feilqbp,1579142500.0,Blue No Matter Who is a rule. It was apparently my mistake to assume that was a given. So I'll obviously vote for them if they get the nom but I'm also gonna do my best to elect a progressive first.
BlackPeopleTwitter,feik7sj,t1_feibrwl,1579140449.0,"But she does. Her website description of her M4A proposal says:

> Medicare for All will finally ensure that Americans have access to all of the coverage they need – not just what for-profit insurance companies are willing to cover – ***including vision, dental, coverage for mental health and addiction services, physical therapy, and long-term care*** for themselves and their loved ones

BlackPeopleTwitter,fehw3dz,t1_fehv8pf,1579125026.0,"What did she do that's ""slipping back into bog standard liberal politics"" exactly? I really don't think that's fair. 

On the Bernie sexism thing, I will take some time to address that because it's the conversation of the hour. 

To me, it doesn't seem unlikely he said something blunt that maybe he didn't mean it in a sexist way, but he sure meant to imply she'd have a harder time facing Trump than he would. I love Bernie and I don't think he meant it as a sexist comment, but it does reveal a contrast in their view of the race. I understand why her campaign brought it up, and also I'm ready for it to go away, just like they both seem to be.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fehul78,t1_fehsjxa,1579124172.0,"Why can't people believe that she legitimately changed her views when she's explained so many times why they changed, and when her entire Senate career is progressive politics? 

On M4A I think you can make a legitimate policy argument that she has the wrong approach, but she clearly has the same end goals as Bernie. She really believes the best way to get there is the program she put forward. Again, I think there's legit disagreements to make on that point. Bernie may be wiser to want to do it all in one fell swoop. But I don't think she's sliding at all."

SandersForPresident,fea3jr9,t1_fe9yxl1,1578943978.0,"I understand the hesitancy to trust that Warren will be as progressive as Sanders. In fact, I think part of her pitch is that she's progressive, but knows which compromises will get more of her agenda accomplished, whereas Bernie seems a bit more uncompromising (in a good way).

Not will, can. So I think he actually proved his case. Plus, the whole joke is stating true things in a misleading way to show how easy it is to scare/mislead people without technically lying, so I think he's also very much in the spirit of the OP."

blackmagicfuckery,fcb7sae,t1_fcanl98,1577583473.0,"To try to explain, and at risk of sounding super pedantic, gravity isn't a speed. Rather, in every second that passes, gravity makes your downwards speed increase by about 10 meters per second (this is to say, g = 9.8 m/s^2 ). He's jumping (giving himself upwards speed) at the start of all of these tricks, and they all seem to take less than a second, so gravity never gets to move him downwards very fast at all."
