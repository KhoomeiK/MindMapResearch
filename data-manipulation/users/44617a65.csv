dogs,fenqxj3,t3_eq24cf,1579289547.0,"I brush mine more frequently because I find it relaxing and he likes to lay there and chew a nylabone while I do it. It'd be fine to brush him every week or every other week. It's going to depend somewhat on coat type; a softer coat is probably going to be quicker to develop mats. I do suggest brushing behind the ears very well once a week because that is where mats are most likely to occur. Bathing happens whenever he's stinky or dirty. Or before a show. If he gets muddy and it isn't that red clay mud, then I'll just let it dry and brush it out. Easy peasy. 

I also trim the hair between his paw pads about once a week because my house has hardwood floors and he'll slip and slide all over if his Grinch feet grow out of control."
dogs,fdy9zyp,t1_fdy9a8o,1578777615.0,"I see how it can be problematic to rant about others making sweeping generalizations when you are also making sweeping generalizations.

I think there's a word for that. Something Latin that begins with an 'H.'"
dogs,fdy96ry,t1_fdy8q8m,1578777325.0,And you're basing yours on all the Aussies you've met. I doubt they're all well bred.
dogs,fdy8jy2,t1_fdy8ag7,1578777194.0,"And every Aussie I'd met before my breeder's dogs was reactive or straight up aggressive toward strangers. Granted, these were all BYBs, but personal experience doesn't trump the breed standard."
dogs,fdy8a2q,t1_fdy83r1,1578777094.0,It's not a joke. It's in the breed standard. They were bred over the past almost one hundred years to possess strong guarding instincts in addition to herding traits.
dogs,fdy82xf,t1_fdy61gp,1578777021.0,That also isn't an example of a toxic comment. It's a cautionary discussion. A better example of a toxic comment would be anything stated by the r/banpitbulls brigaders.
dogs,fdy7cvc,t1_fdy61gp,1578776874.0,"That was because OP said they want a dog friendly to strangers. Friendly to strangers implies a lab or golden personality. There are plenty of Aussies that love the attention of strangers - mine is one of them - but you don't get an Aussie expecting that personality when the breed standard states ""reserved toward strangers."" You have to go into the breed being ok with a dog that might not take to your friends and family right away."
dogs,fdy3iwk,t3_enb8li,1578775687.0,I don't know who's saying Aussies aren't friendly because they certainly don't know the breed standard. It specifically states that fear or aggression is to heavily penalized. Aloof with strangers != not friendly.
dogs,fbx3go9,t1_fbx30vs,1577167810.0,"It wasn't supposed to show anything other than your claim that I'd never be able to exercise my dog like another dog is flawed. I'm also not seeing any studies to back up your claims. 


I'm certainly not arguing against the notion that many dogs could certainly use more exercise, but the pet obesity epidemic would probably be better addressed through educating people on how much food their dog should actually be eating. It's easier to get people to measure out their dog's food and switch to healthier treats than it is to get people to change their lifestyle in order to provide more exercise for their dog(s)."
