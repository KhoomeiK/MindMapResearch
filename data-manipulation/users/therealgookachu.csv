I asked what does she look like? He replied that she has blond hair and blue eyes, and is about 5'3"", and her name is Jenny Anderson. Not joking. I just stood there blinking and started laughing. He got mad at me and I said, ""this is Minnesota, 50% of the female population is blue eyed and blond haired and named Jenny."" And I swept my hands out to the gathered crowd watching the show. He got really pissy, so I shouted, ""Hey, Jenny!"" and like 50% of the women turned around, most of whom were blond.

AskAnAmerican,ffgokwy,t3_etevfy,1579911121.0,"The vast majority of Americans are somewhere in between Bernie Sanders and Mitch McConnell. Some may lean more left, some may lean more right, but generally, the majority are moderates.

The problem is perception and the way our political process works:

1) We have primaries and caucuses for president. Because a lot of states only allow voting in caucuses and primaries by your party affiliation, the parties play to their bases. This means skewing far left or far right. That by no means it represents most of the ppl in the party. It's just that the most fervent, ardent party politics ppl only vote in primaries and caucuses. By the time the general election rolls around, everyone moves to the center.

2) The GOP have moved very far to the right. The Dems have started moving back to the left. During the Clinton administration and Bush Jr years, there wasn't a lot of light between the GOP and Dems. There's an old British joke: ""we have a party like your republicans-they're called Tories. We also have a party like your Dems-they're called Tories."" That started to change at the tail-end of the Bush Jr years with the rise of the tea party.

3) We elected a black man for 2 terms. Never mind politically he was more like an Eisenhower republican than a Dem, because he's black, the racists, in both parties, lost their collective shit.

4) [The Southern Strategy and Reagan's Deal with the Devil](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/05/trump-reagan-nixon-republican-party-racism). 

5) Trump, for any decent person regardless of political affiliation, is noxious, and he's become the standard bearer of the GOP. Despite being a lefty liberal, I have a lot of Christian conservative friends and family. My inlaws are extremely Catholic (so much so that for their 50th anniversary got their marriage blessed by the pope!), pro-life, gun-owning conservatives, yet this past summer they changed their voter affiliation to independent because Trump disgusts them so much.

So, in short, as a lefty liberal, I have a lot of respect for old fashioned GOP. Men like Bob Dole, Colin Powell, and John McCain did a helluva lot of good for the country. I may have disagreed with them politically, but I never doubted their intelligence, patriotism, or sanity. But, you notice that Dole and Powell aren't actively involved in GOP politics anymore, due to the fact that they won't support a nutbag like Trump, because they value country over party.

AskAnAmerican,fel0cui,t1_fektzf1,1579211350.0,"No, I actually don't. Never been to Europe. In the above-comments, ppl mentioned that co-workers did this to them. That's the only information I have on the custom, hence the questions."
AskAnAmerican,fekzu7j,t1_feksmsv,1579211043.0,"I grew up in MN. I think I'd like northern Scandinavia just fine. I mean MN is kinda Scandinavia, just with more Irish and Germans throw in in St. Paul."
AskAnAmerican,fekzp7e,t1_fekq6cl,1579210959.0,"One of my cousins married a Finnish man. She met his family for the first time in the sauna. Coming from a repressed, Irish Catholic farm family upbringing, it was quite shocking."

AskAnAmerican,fekkyyq,t1_fejp4ms,1579202219.0,"You guys don't do the kissing on the cheek thing, do you? Cos I legit think I'd punch someone if they tried that on me. I don't like to be touched. And I don't want to talk to strangers. I want to be left alone. Earphones are the biggest blessing ever bestowed on introverts."

wholesomememes,fekhjvv,t1_fejjcj3,1579200179.0,There is this [great bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfcC6FYyL4U) from the Monty Python show at the O2 several years ago of him running over Brian Green. It's awsum.
TheMagnusArchives,fekcz8b,t3_epe6hb,1579197458.0,"Nope. But, I've hunted and butchered my own meat, so it wasn't shocking or anything (from MN farm family).

I am, however, extremely phobic to spiders, and just generally hate bugs. So, anything having to deal with bugs just creeps me out."
AskAnAmerican,fek2cwt,t1_fejkt3o,1579191130.0,"Did they try to kiss you, too? Could you tell them not to?"
AskAnAmerican,fek1jfr,t1_fejsqtl,1579190621.0,"Also MN. My mom was the worst, and my father, brother, and I would get in the car and literally start driving away to get her to leave. We'd have to start doing our goodbyes at like 5 if we wanted to leave by 7."
AskAnAmerican,fek0v9c,t1_fejgszl,1579190209.0,"This happens all the time. My husband is an artist; I'm a lawyer (non-practicing). We own our own business. Whenever dealing with anything contractual, they always look to him. And he's always like, ""dude, I'm the one that draws the pretty pictures. She's the one with the degree. Talk to her."" And, he'll leave the conversation/room/whatever. And, they'll still be condescending fucks and tell me I should ask my husband his opinion. That's usually when I tell them to fuck off and break off negotiations.

Another funny thing is food. I'm a meat & potato girl, and if I'm going out to dinner, I'm going to damn well have steak since we eat it so rarely. The husband, on the other hand, loves fish and salad. Servers, without fail will give the steak to the husband, the fish to me. If I cared, I suppose I could find it offensive, but it's just social programming and no harm is meant. But, it does happen all the time and shows just how bad gender stereotypes are ingrained into our brains without even being conscious of it."

I don’t see any difference from when I was in high school/college in the late 80s-early 90s to now. The only ppl that really knew how to use computers were geeks. I mean, how many of you can build a box, much less even know what that phrase means? 

It’s like the bitching that I heard all the time when Windows 95 was introduced, and old ppl decried how “young ppl” didn’t have to learn DOS. They don’t _need_ to anymore so why should they? And now with smart phones and iPads and tablets, with Alexa and Siri, why should the need to learn archaic skills like typing when it’s obvious that technology is going the way of voice activation?

There will always be a place for geeks. Hell, 2400 is still published. But we shouldn’t look down on the younger generations for not knowing soon-to-be outdated skills. There’s a whole generation that was born after Windows 95, yet there are still plenty of kids that can configure an autoexec.bat or fix a registry cos there will always be geeks like that. Things will be fine."
