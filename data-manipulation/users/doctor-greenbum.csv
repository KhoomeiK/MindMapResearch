GetMotivated,ffbmjq1,t3_esm9dg,1579772787.0,"This is the only good post I’ve ever seen on this sub. Most of it is absolute shite. Just really low-res, shitty quotes ripped from Instagram or Facebook, that make absolutely no sense. Normally some shitty advice over a picture of a lion.. or a guy in a nice suit showing off his expensive watch and Ferrari steering wheel. This post actually makes a lot of sense, and it is genuinely a really useful piece of insight. Thanks, OP."
movies,fenj9p9,t1_fel9fmm,1579285885.0,"I actually do agree that the second half was like getting 7/10ths of a blowjob. It certainly wasn’t terribly boring, though.....  it was the best movie I have seen come out in around half a decade. It may not rival the Godfather, but it’s a very welcome change when the other movies coming out are things like a half-cooked “Catz the musical” spinoff. And those Marvel movies.... hours of totally incoherent, unimaginative, dull tripe that rely on pure eye candy. It beats every single one of them by miles."
videos,fejm1oi,t1_fejjm8z,1579179457.0,"Listen, you arrogant, creepy, wanker. I have no problem with trans people. I have friends and family who have transitioned both ways. I recognise it as a mental illness and think that if transitioning is proven to be an effective treatment, I’m all for it.  
   
For starters, I was not justifying the abuse or murder of trans people whatsoever. Of course what I said doesn’t make it OK - I hope you aren’t thick enough to think I meant it was OK to kill trans people who lie about it. My point was that lying about it (or withholding the info) makes violence from those people a lot more likely. So your point about using that as an excuse is completely moot, it’s bullshit.  

You do NOT get to dictate whether or not someone is comfortable sleeping with someone who has transitioned. Whether you like it or not, some people still consider your biological sex to be the bottom line, and you need to respect those beliefs just as you’d expect them to stay respectful of yours. It doesn’t make them transphobic at all, this is only very recently becoming a common thing in society, and there are still a lot of people who haven’t fully wrapped their heads round it. Those people should not be tricked into fucking someone who is actually the same sex, biologically at birth. It’s not right. You have no idea the damage that could have on someone.  
   
Pull your head out of your arse and stop being so bloody selfish. You are absolutely devoid of empathy if you think it’s OK to hide this from sexual partners. If you expect people to be considerate of you, maybe try thinking about how they feel, instead of thinking purely about yourself and looking out for your own interests. It’s terrifying knowing people like you exist, and the situation you’d be happy to put someone in just because it means you’re more likely to get laid. It’s straight up sexually predatory, and there’s no denying that."

And I completely agree, I think it’s one of the many symptoms that trans women are much less socially accepted than trans men."
videos,fejdwwe,t1_fej4nrn,1579169300.0,"Literally the only time I can see that happening on any regular basis, is if it’s a person who isn’t sexually interested in trans people, but was lured into sex and then found out after... I mean there are so many flaws in this line of thinking. I support your transition 100% if it’s genuinely going to help your mental health, but there is absolutely no excuse for hiding it from someone you’re in any sort of sexual or romantic relationship with. And, in fact, I think the fact (some) trans people are not disclosing their transition before having sex, is probably spurring on more violence from the anti-trans types."
