science,ffdjl26,t1_ffczrxg,1579822244.0,"I don’t think further restrictions are gonna help. I believe the sheer amount of guns floating around in America is increasing probability of gun crimes. Its just mathematics.

In AUS guns very hard to come by mainly because our gun culture is very small and mostly limited to my parents generation who grew up hunting and no longer hunt.

Only guns I’ve seen were someones grand parents or farmers who own from sheer necessity. I know no hobby gun owners at all here in my circle.

I don’t believe America (or Aus) will ever have a dictatorship your army is full of freedom fighters who believe and die for democracy. A coup would quickly happen if someone dared to try.

As an outsider its very sad for us to see what is happening in your country."

aww,felih7t,t1_fekj4br,1579222963.0,"One of my girls as a kitten growled and hissed when we picked her up. From a breeder but has nystagmus?. We thought she would always be like that but lots of play time, kept picking her up ignoring growling and lots of scritches. Treaties. 

Shes still very shy (4 yo) and hides under bed if i go to pick her up sometimes esp if i move very quickly. Other times she’s literally yelling out to be picked up (if im on pc working) and purrs soon as u touch her every time.

Silly Lilly we call her, she hates loud noises and tells us off stacking dishwasher/alfoil etc...

Just keep the faith and effort to play as its bonding."
aww,felh1bs,t1_felfs4u,1579221980.0,"I grew up with feral farm cat my nanna kept after moving when we used to feed it sometimes it would attack my nannas hands. Not playfully but to cause maximum damage. I was legitimately scared of that cat.

I doubt Rastus could ever be tamed but my nanna loved him all the same."

Documentaries,fdozum2,t1_fdnjvne,1578616664.0,"I worked at a Jewish school in Australia. Plastered all over hallways were memorials of kids/families who died from rocket attacks in Israel (apparently not students or families of students just Israelites). Very sad but what saddened me even more was these kids were clearly being trained/ingrained with hate for Palestinians even when living in a tolerant peaceful country.

There will never be peace whilst they continue to teach/literally breed hate."

If you have a decent DSLR camera already you have half the gear all you really need is a 2.8/14mm lens and tripod.
