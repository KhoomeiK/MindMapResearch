fatlogic,fd5dzma,t1_fd2m9tt,1578176733.0,"Currently, I don't have any podcasts saved as favorites and I don't remember titles (sorry), but I've recently listened to some public radio science podcasts relating to health, some Christy Harrison this week, Jimmy Moore and Jason Fung are always fun for discussion, Robert Lustig and others. If I see a name in this sub, I’ll tend to search for a related podcast so I can listen during a walk/workout session.

My interests run the gamut from sanity to fatlogic and everywhere in between. I usually search the following: ""HAES"", ""sugar"", ""glucose"", ""fructose"", ""CICO"", ""calories"", ""fasting"", ""keto diet"", ""lipolysis"", ""Kreb’s cycle"", “cardio”, ""weight training”, ""nutrition"".

I look at these podcasts in the same manner I look at posts within this sub: If someone continues down a road of misinformation, they’ll eventually feel as if there’s no use in trying to lose weight, so what’s the point, 95% gain it back anyway, additional excuse, additional excuse, etc.

r/fatlogic is a great place for open discussion on how to help move the needle back to sanity.  I would think that adding a podcast thread would add another dimension in the battle.  Unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to run it (I assume the mods would like to do that for sanity's/order's sake as well), but it could be interesting.

I'm gonna rule out any local churches celebrating the Epiphany (wise men visiting baby Jesus) as frankincense apparently has a strong plastic smell. However, even in the cold weather, I don’t think it would remain a strong smell for long. Plus they probably would have the events occur outside.

The smell could be wires burning from a faulty motor or electrical unit somewhere nearby.

One longshot guess would be that the smell could be from horse manure. 
 The smell might not be from the manure itself, however.

I have a feeling that it might just be the asphalt plant near you, as suggested by u/Prof_Acorn, or another industrial smell located in the area.  I really hope it's not an electrical failure.

On my walk to the gym in the freezing cold, I decided to listen to one of her podcasts to understand more about her viewpoints.  My constant headshaking must have burned an additional 50 kcals by the time I got to the fitness center.

It got me thinking that this sub should look into having a weekly or monthly podcast thread, where users can link a podcast episode as the parent comment and have podcast thread in the child comments below, or something like that. I just wished podcast apps made timestamp linking as easy as YouTube links.

fatlogic,fcy0lhw,t3_ejgni9,1578073072.0,"After I lost a lot of weight a couple years ago, my obese sister latched onto my success and took me to meet her bosses – a chiropractor and a nutritionist – in order to help me lose my remaining weight “the right way”. I concluded that all of this was for her bosses to take advantage of my sister and to sell her diet products and nutritional info, items I didn’t care to use, so I declined.

Since that time, she moved closer to my mother and stepfather – both of whom suffer from dementia – and give them advice on their diets. She’s gained a lot more weight (she was morbidly obese prior to the weight gain) and landed a job in administration at her local hospital. I’m afraid she believes this job gives her immediate credibility to her opinions on health.

So it was a rough Christmas Eve as I watched my morbidly obese sister give my mother and stepfather advice on their diets, all while inhaling cheese-flavored crackers directly from the box like it was the last food she’ll ever see.

Aside from this sub, I felt like I had no allies this holiday season.  I knew a lot of common sense things regarding health and wellness before I landed on this sub a few years back, but I’m not sure where I’d be if I hadn’t connected all of the dots in order to make it work “the right way”.
