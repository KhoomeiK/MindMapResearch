ChronicPain,ffc2oh9,t3_esrfjt,1579790034.0,This is too real. It gives me all the feels. I wish other people could understand this when I explain it.
Baking,ff23tf0,t3_er5tvd,1579493043.0,"As I scrolled down, I legitimately thought this was a stack of pancakes. You’re cake is absolutely incredible and you’re quite talented!"
ChronicPain,ff1icg6,t3_er3ju8,1579479680.0,I second this amazing PSA! Support cats for the win!
AskReddit,ferxghp,t1_fep70ey,1579359352.0,That’s a bummer. I remember seeing them in the 90s. They were really great with such a fun stage presence.
ankylosingspondylitis,fephu7d,t3_eqavco,1579320879.0,"Yes! I feel like I have a better relationship with my PCP this winter than most of my family. I didn’t have this problem on Humira. 
I hope you feel better soon."
northernexposure,fef43hm,t3_eota7n,1579047708.0,"SPOILERS! 
My favorite episode is “Aurora Borealis”.  This episode is absolutely incredible! Even the music is perfect! Anytime I’m looking for a smile I watch this episode. 
We have the introduction of Chris and Adam. 
Joel venturing to the unknown to meet a new patient. 
Bernard and Chris speaking in unison and Carl Jung! 
The great reveal of the Aurora Borealis sculpture and Maurice’s hilarious reaction. 
In my opinion this episode has the essence of Cicely and Northern Exposure."

Baking,fdj03bh,t3_elk43e,1578455050.0,Those look absolutely amazing! I was so ready to make them until I saw the 5 sticks of butter (and momentarily fainted).
Ebay,fdim09i,t3_elkbbw,1578445891.0,Always put them in a zip bag first! Use lots of bubble wrap. Get insurance if possible. Over the years I’ve found shipping perfume to be a game of chance. No matter how well you pack the perfume accidents still happen. Good luck.
AskMen,fdik915,t3_elacu8,1578444775.0,Lady here! I have to post because this is groundbreaking! This completely demystifies online dating for me! I’m 6’1” and completely divulged this my profile. When I meet men who claimed to be 6’ (or taller) they would be shocked I was so much taller than them.  I never cared about a potential dates height but this always confused me.
