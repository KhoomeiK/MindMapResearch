todayilearned,fdizpi2,t1_fdiwdgv,1578454786.0,"If everything the government spends money on becomes voluntary, or even, if just the things that don't directly affect you become voluntary, a ton of very important shit would go away. Homeless aids, orphanages and foster care, public schools, research grants, environment protection; all just to name a few. Ok yea a voluntary tax system will keep the government from spending money on bullshit, but it wall also prevent them from getting the shit we need! Btw, a voluntary tax would also apply to the rich, and guess who's gonna say a lot of ""no""..."
todayilearned,fdivg7i,t1_fdirt1d,1578451935.0,"I never said it's justified, I said it's there. And if it's there, and we all benefit equally from it, we gotta pay for it. And trust me when I say, with the shit Trump says to foreign leaders and diplomats we are all benefiting from a defense fund."
todayilearned,fdiv9oq,t1_fdiso0c,1578451817.0,"Ok, so any of that doesn't directly help the general population is now unfunded. This would include government adoption agencies, any aid to the homeless, all government funded environmental protection efforts such as natural parks. There's lots of shit the average American may choose not to pay extra for, regardless of if there is a moral obligation to do so. There is a reason no government works this way."
todayilearned,fdipkmh,t1_fde9v7r,1578448172.0,"A lot of this stuff goes WAY over my head. The link I posted was actually from another comment chain I read, 2 sources we're in the comment, one supporting young forests, one for old. I read through the link I posted and most of it was lost on me, but wanted to show that, from my understanding, the research is not entirely one-sided."
todayilearned,fdip27l,t1_fdik6zh,1578447847.0,"So, the government provided a service called military. It cost them $700 billion in 2019. That service was given to 330 million people. So, simple division means each household, regardless of income should be billed $2000 per person, for just the services from military. You want me to keep going, or are you realizing how fucking expensive this will get for everyone?"
todayilearned,fdioi0t,t1_fdigsi8,1578447487.0,There are laws passed at the state level. There are also rules and regulations passed by cities/towns and counties (parishes for you in Louisiana). There are lots of ways to get involved with local politics is you look for them.
todayilearned,fdinqbv,t1_fdikpxp,1578446999.0,"While ""they"" do work together, the government is huge. It includes the underpaid dmv workers, mailman, firefighters, that FBI intern who only grabs coffee. These guys would have nothing to do with journalist assassination. We definitely need to fight corruption in the government. We need to get the bad apples out. We should never just blindly trust the government, but instead diligently seek out the unethical people in the system.  But we shouldn't be anti government just because of the immoral few. 

And while presidential elections operate under a representative democracy, most elected officials are elected through a direct democracy, including senators. And it's the senate who holds most of the power and sway in government, not the president. Getting involved is really easy, but following candidates and elections for county, city, state, and federal government is very time-consuming, so most people opt out until a presidential election comes along."
todayilearned,fdim98x,t1_fdi9gzd,1578446052.0,"This is why I support the second amendment. It wasn't made to protect gun enthusiasts or hunters, the second amendment exists to allow us to fight a tyrannical government. It's just a shame that military technology surpassed the amendment, and while we can own guns, we cannot own jets, tanks, missiles, etc; all the things needed to form a MODERN militia.

But too many people, particularly liberals from my experience, have the utmost blind faith in government."

todayilearned,fblje8p,t1_fbjsz14,1576963909.0,"Thats why mom and pop places hire the uneducated with no plans of education for their staff. Training overhead is fucking expensive, between the pay, mistakes, loss of revenue due to inexperience (example is not getting an easy upsell), etc. New hire costs add up very fast. According to the Association for talent development training new hires costs an average of $1,252. So yes, companies would rather not hire the grossly overqualified applicant who will leave in the short term."
