Nothing quite on point sizewise. The container ship layout wise is what i have drawn up. Just smaller and the container storage is two large tanks for holding crab.

The justification for the run is that the russian mob was running guns into Seattle using a crab fishing vessel as cover. One of the tanks is full of guns in water tight containers along with crabs. The ship hit a disaster at sea the crew is dead and the ship is derelict. The ship is being towed back to shore by a UCAS coast guard vessel. The russians know if it makes it to shore the UCAS will find the guns and uncover the whole smuggling ring. So the runners are hired to sneak onboard at sea at dispose of the guns, or recover them for a bonus without alerting the ship towing it.

For the hideout I wanted a ship just big enough for 6 crew cabins and a cargo hold just big enough to fit a van in (deck crane lifts it) and space for a Northrop wasp on the deck."

Shadowrun,fdqt7p5,t3_emrwkd,1578674367.0,"Your mage should be using astral projection for recon before a run. That's a pretty basic thing that he can do to remind people it's there. 

My group I'm the only mage, we basically never enter a building without at a minimum the technomancer finding the floor plan either through public records on the matrix or hacking the cameras and me poking my astral head through the building to get a count of how many people are in our way.

I have been slapped by a security mage or spirit a few times for this when going at higher value facilities. I usually cut and run rather than fight 1v1 and we've tipped off security something is up but most of the time the intel is valuable.

Edit: thought of a simple run addition you can add to include a touch of astral flare without cutting the mundanes out of the run completely. Send them after a magical mcguffin that the Johnson doesn't know what exactly it looks like. The item will have an aura in astral space, so you'll need the mage to astral perceive inside a vault or museum or something to identify it."

With all the story this really isnt that bad except for PvP in general being tough and generally to be avoided.

As a GM, in my opinion the GM made some mistakes. First and foremost was railroading you into the encounter in the house, especially while one of the other runners was away. If you resisted entering the house because it was dangerous and the party was split, enigma could have gotten aggressive about it. Possibly tipping the cards on the whole thing. There should always be multiple avenues of approach to a run, spending a whole session going Oceans 11 on the plan is half the fun.

Second was his run was not at all tailored for the characters involved. Enigma doesn't count so there is exactly one awakened character, you, who I assume does not have astral perception. Up against a run focused on background counts, spirits, and ancient artifacts. Why would the Johnson have hired this unqualified crew for this mess? It would be like sending a team in to retrieve encrypted files from a server without a decker/technomancer.

That said, if the GM isnt a dick and allowed the edge burn to save you and make a full recovery. Not gimping your character in the process. Then chalk it up to a learning experience for GM and Players and do your best to enjoy the rest and hope the GM does better on his next run."

I was taking you to mean that the U.S. would get punted out of Iran with its tail between its legs. I don't believe that will happen.

 If we actually invade Iran (which I doubt) it WILL be very messy. The casualties will be worse than Iraq, especially at the beginning. But it will end with the destruction of Iran's military and the ousting of their government."

Shadowrun,fcycyo7,t3_ejhhi4,1578078265.0,"PvP is such a bad fit for shadowrun. In a well formed group not everyone has a ton of combat skill. In the end the street sam or combat mage is just going to kill everyone on the other team.

Even if you make a social skill work on a player. He's just going to find a reason to shoot you as soon as he has a flimsy reason for the social check not to apply.

If you really really want to have a player be a traitor, it should be done so the traitor is working with the GM to advance an enjoyable story for the rest. Definitely not ""oh I am betraying the team, hope you roll better than me or this whole campaign is over.""

Finally ""stop making characters who don't want to be there."" Characters whose backstory makes them not trust or not want to work with the group is the worst sin of a player. The GM telling you it's your fault for trusting him. Fuck that, you trusted him because you're a group of friends sitting around a table. Not trusting him just ruins everyones fun, you didnt roleplay all the times he refused to grab a beer or quick hid his commlink when you walked in the room that would have made not trusting him plausible.

Without more info I don't know how to resolve this. Are other players on your side? Or are you alone because you got it the worst.

You've got that gravity bit off, that was OPs point. If the mass of the sun collapsed into a black hole it wouldn't effect the orbit of the earth, all the mass is still there just more compact. Earth would happily keep orbiting the black hole.

The sun also has a huge effect on surface temperature. That'd why it gets cold and night and hot during the day, and why it is always warm at the equator and alwats frozen at the poles.
