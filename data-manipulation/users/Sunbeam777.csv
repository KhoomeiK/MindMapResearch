learnmath,ffexiyt,t1_ffexfyt,1579869475.0,Oh I see what you mean now. Thats a nice way to do it.

Try a different book, a different website, a different video, a different explanation until you get it! Part of the challenge is perseverance with a lust to find how to work through the problem even when it is difficult."
