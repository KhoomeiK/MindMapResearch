cats,ffyndjd,t1_ffyncn5,1580350539.0,I'm sorry if I came across wrong the first time!
cats,ffyn4nq,t1_ffymh6w,1580350373.0,"Well for starters, I suggest making sure that anything your cat could potentially eat and hurt itself is put well away. One of our girls is clever and figured out how to open the cupboards so we had to toddler proof a few things but it works perfectly. From there, I highly suggest getting your hands on some sort of disinfectant that isnt going to leave behind a residue that your cats could potentially pick up on their paws. My wife and I use a veterinarian grade disinfectant that you spray on and wipe off, and presto chango, the counter is clean.

You can also make your counters the ""less favorable"" option. A lot of cats tend to like sitting in high places in order to survey their kingdom, however some cats are more medium height dwellers. Hell some cats just prefer the floor. You've got to get to know your cat, and figure out what sort of deal they have. Personally, I've got one tree cat, and a beach dweller who is FAR more likely to be stepped on. Try to find a cat tree/box that suits your cats personality.

Last but certainly not least, you need to accept that we all make mistakes, and are not perfect beings. I was once a squirt gun diplomat myself. I was top gun with that bottle. Lucy steps one furry little toe on that counter? She got the spray. But then I stumbled onto a few sources (I'd be MORE than happy to share btw) and found that I was all wrong about it, and instead of ""teaching"" her, I was damaging my bond with her. Every single one of us is capable of being wrong. It's how we act when we find out that were wrong that's important. Do we accept it? Move forward? Perhaps even change? Or do we lash out against the people who are honestly only trying to help?"
cats,ffym5cv,t1_ffykky4,1580349707.0,THIS. Would you rather be respected through love? Or fear?
cats,ffym0lt,t3_evx0vk,1580349619.0,"Honestly, you're hooped. Even if you find a way to get the cat off the counter when you're around, there isnt a damn thing you can do to stop it when you're not around, and I GUARANTEE that the cat will go on the counter when you leave your home.

My advice is to make cleaning the counters a habitual thing. Your cats live in the house too, no? Arguably, they spend far more time in it than you do (depending in whether or not your cats are kept indoors) so why not let them strut where they may? Personally, my wife and I have just made a habit of keeping food and other things we dont want our cats to get into locked out of their furry little reach, and always make sure to keep a tidy home."
cats,ffylq2j,t1_ffyinql,1580349422.0,Squirt gun diplomacy isnt going to do anything but teach your cat to he afraid of you. I highly suggest you find a better way to teach your cat than by scaring it.

Give the old boy a wash, with a nice gentle soap. Clean him up. Then give him a good week. You probably damn near turned it into jerky trying to have a jerky (thank you, I'm here all day)

insaneparents,fd9i9sp,t1_fd9h5rz,1578233700.0,"I've always been so curious why so many parents are like this? For me it was the exact opposite.

When my wife slept over at my parents house for the first time when we were 17, I didnt even ask, or really even remotely acknowledge to my parents that she would be sleeping over. My parents knew I was responsible, and they had no illusions about whether or not i was sexually active. It was simply none of their business, so they didnt ask. My wife was SHOCKED. 

Personally, I think that parents need to have more trust in their children. My dads logic was pretty solid. He can TRY to control every thing I do, and eventually I'll just start sneaking around to do the things i want, OR him and I can have an up front and honest relationship, and even if I don't always do exactly what he WISHES I would do, he still raised a smart and responsible man who will succeed, or fail, but on my own terms."

AmItheAsshole,fd9foqz,t3_ekcqzm,1578232682.0,"I'm gonna say ESH. The neighbor should be more considerate, yes, but you also chose to live in a place that is attached to other people homes, even sharing a wall, so it stands to reason that you'll have to put up with other peoples noise.

I get the vibe that both you and your neighbor can be difficult people to deal with, and when people like that get butting heads, good luck. I suggest learning to live with it, or make a formal noise complaint with the police, but beyond that there isnt much you can do. 

I live in a similar situation. Neighbors share a wall, and they're loud. Sometimes they stomp around their place so loud I swear someone's coming down my stairs, and every single time they leave they slam their door hard enough that It shakes our walls. It's just something you have to learn to accept when you live in close proximity to other people: some people are less considerate than others. My advice is to stop thinking about how much your noise effects them. Clearly they dont care how much theirs effects yours."
