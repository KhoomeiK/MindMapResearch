iphone,fdkwy4x,t1_fdkw1ao,1578512865.0,"The iPhone SE was the closest we got, true. Unfortunately as we still see in this very thread, it was marketed and priced as a budget device. For a premium brand like Apple it should be obvious that this would drive certain customers away from it. 

Look, it’s all about where your priorities lie. I agree that there’s a minority of customers that have the ergonomics of the device as their absolute first priority. The hill I’m choosing to die on here is that this in no way means every other customer prefers big phones to small phones. It just means the big phones have features that are more important to them than size. 

I myself was forced into this choice recently. I was a diehard SE user but got transferred abroad. Rather than carry two phones I got a XS so I could have two SIMs active. I still hate how hard it is to use this thing one handed but it’s a sacrifice I’m making. I’d gladly pay 50% more for a more ergonomic device, but that’s not an option."
