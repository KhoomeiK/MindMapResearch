How did you respond to an, admittedly annoying, inconvenience? You didn't instruct the child, you didn't confront them in a healthy way, you went straight to yelling and cursing. What can the child learn from your behavior? Will they learn to handle conflict or disappointment or anger appropriately, by yelling and cursing like you did?


I'm going to disagree with some other posters and say that the kid should've known better. 6 is in first grade, 6 should know they can't just go around punching cakes and making messes. Heck, I have three kids, they all knew that by like 4 at least. But you're supposed to be the adult, and the kid obviously needed parenting for their bad behavior, but you aren't their parent, and you didn't respond in a way that would be appropriate for the parent to respond.

That's really what we're discussing. If the point is to rehabilitate them, so that they may be released back into society with the hopes that they won't reoffend, then mental healthcare is a catch all phrase for 'evaluate why this person thinks this is appropriate behavior, help them realize why it is not appropriate behavior'. That's not something a regular doctor or team of nurses are trained to do, much less a traditional hospital being equipped to manage that sort of thing, thus the 'mental' part of it. 


Especially when it is a minor, give them a chance to be better than their circumstances(read: shitty parents and upbringing) raised them to be. Society owes them that before it gives up on them. 

Locking a kid up is just sending them to con-college, where they'll get their degree in burglary or drug trafficking or, in the absolute least, will have contact with, and possibly encouraged by, much more nefarious people. The solution cannot be life imprisonment without first making every attempt to rehabilitate and educate the individual."

Why did I, personally, visit WPD occasionally? To remind myself how fragile life is. It can all end in the blink of an eye, due to no fault or wrong doing on your part. Historically, death and despair were all around every day. It was not at all uncommon for a family to have several children because it was very likely that some, or even all, of those children would not survive to adulthood. War, famine, drought, weather, sickness and disease... All horrible things, but all part of life for us as a species, and exposure to such things, I believe, kept people aware of their mortality and appreciative of the life they lived. Today, a LOT of life is simplified, and we are sheltered from the worst mankind has faced because society has fundamentally changed the way the average person(in a developed country) lives. WPD was a callback to the brutality that is our existence. It helped me fight my depression by reminding me that, hey, sometimes you're just walking down the street and a piece of glass falls off a skyscraper and smashes the fuck out of you. Or sometimes you're just driving down the road with your family when a truck going the other direction tosses a brick into your passenger seat and kills your mother. It's a morbid curiosity, perhaps, but personally, if I ever die in a way that is WPD worthy, I would be comforted to know that my death, as random as it may have been, at least contributed in some way to remind people to take a moment and cherish all that life has to offer."

>The same thing happened with automation in assembly work and people fussed then. 

There is a major difference in increased productivity via industrialization and increased profitability via workforce reduction. The factory didn't ask its customers to come and start assembling their widgets--the machines made it so that 100 widgets could be produced an hour instead of 50, allowed less people to be required to make the same amount of end product. Self checkout is not making it more efficient by increasing the productivity of the cashier, it's eliminating the cashier and asking the customer to perform the exact same function that the cashier would have, without having any impact on the cost of goods sold. The money does not go back to the consumer, it's staying with the giant corporation. And wealth aggregation is arguably one of the most dangerous things our society faces."

FYI, this is exactly how it is in the US... If guy in OP had gone to a hospital, they'd have provided whatever medicine they needed for the immediate care of the child. No hospital in the US will turn away a patient who is in need of medical attention, billing details will be worked out later and will likely not even be part of the attending physicians' thought process (beyond the admitting nurse potentially asking if they have insurance). There are social programs to work through for continued or on-going care, as hospitals should be reserved for those who have immediate need of care beyond what can typically be provided at home.

And, to be perfectly blunt, this may be an unpopular opinion, but if this parent cannot provide for their child such that they are forced to turn to a life of crime to obtain $20~ worth of medicine, they have some serious reflection they should be doing. Society did not bring that child into the world, they did, and if they are unable or unwilling to change their life in whatever way is required so that they may provide for their child, then yes they absolutely are failing their child and that child deserves better. The cost of raising a child is SO MUCH MORE than just their medicine, how can this parent possibly be reasonably expected to be meeting the nutritional and developmental needs of their child if they are not even able to provide medicine? It's not the child's fault, and that is why we have social programs--to help ensure the child doesn't have to suffer for their parents' mistakes. But it still requires the parent to go through those programs."

I can make that without a degree, why would anyone want to be pissed on, spit on, shat on, covered in God knows what, slapped, and harassed for 12 hours a day? Hospitals don't take patient care seriously and will routinely give you 5+ patients(sometimes as many as 7 or 8 before they'll actually call staffing in), including some on isolation, meaning you've got to put on a special suit and go deal with some infectious, potentially crazy, sick person. And, especially in Florida, if your patients aren't elderly, they're probably going to be the drug seeking tweekers who bring and constantly try to sneak their own 'prescriptions'. Who curse and scream at you because you won't let them take their oxy, or because they've developed a resistance to the pain killer they've been prescribed.


Nurses, by nature, are people who love indiscriminately and genuinely care about their patients. But for the 8 years she worked in FL, not a single of the three hospitals she worked at actually gave a shit about their nurses. They'd work them to the bone, push them to the limits, and then demand they come back for their next shift to put up with the same bulllshit, being understaffed and overworked. 

So why does a nurse deserve $30+/hr? Because they know what to do when your heart stops, they know how to keep the doctors involved in your care, they know how to make family members feel at ease as their loved one codes or is knocked out for emergency surgery. Because the few nice patients they get tend to be the ones who they have to watch slowly die as modern medicine cannot correct the deficiency in their frail and failing body. Because they have to put the same smile on their face for a meth head as they do your grandma, and every single one of their patients may be in need of their expert care--at any given moment.

Edit: Question for all you collectors... Should we be saving the boxes? I've been trying to encourage them to keep the sets separate and with their instructions, so they can rebuild them if they get damaged, but are the empty boxes worth breaking down to save or saving without breaking down? I'm a lego idiot, so any insight you can share is appreciated."
