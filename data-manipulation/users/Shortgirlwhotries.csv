fatlogic,fgmdl4g,t3_ezavx9,1580922499.0,"So, we all know (and FAs do not let us forget) that when we’re on a deficit for an extended time, we might see NEAT reduce. I don’t really argue with that, because I personally get cold and less energetic when I’m on a steep deficit for a while. But I also feel like my NEAT at maintenance is wayy higher than when I was obese and wondering if others have noticed the same? Interested because even with my TDEE lowering as a lost weight as anticipated, my “metabolism” is “faster” at my low weight than expected it to be, and I think part of it is that I act more like a thin person - as in, I get up more, fidget more, seek out casual movement more, because it’s easier to do now.

Invisalign,fgm8i7a,t1_fgm5yfe,1580919925.0,"Hi there! I just wrote a really long recap comment because I couldn’t post with the pic, but short answer is that I did this contemporaneously with the Invisalign and was so worried about timing too but it ended up being a non-issue."
Invisalign,fgm89re,t3_ezbnih,1580919812.0,"Hi folks! I am finalizing (as in, taking impressions for my final retainer) today and wanted to give a recap because my process was a little out of the norm and figured it might be informative for others who have similar needs - in particular I was obsessively worried about the timing of everything, so hopefully I can set some minds at ease so you don’t have to annoy your ortho like I did! In total my process took almost exactly one year.

I had two baby teeth (21 and 29, see pic) when I did my initial consult that have bothered me for several years (just pain in surrounding gums, hard to keep them clean). I met with my orthodontist in January 2019 and he instructed me to get them extracted immediate and referred me to an oral surgeon.

Despite being told it was an easy procedure, my extractions were agonizing and easily the worst part. My roots had been reabsorbed and so the surgeon had grind the teeth off in pieces. If you need this done and can afford it I would do it sedated because I did not expect it to be horrifying and it absolutely was traumatic. Healing was not a day at the beach either, as I was very concerned about dry socket and bits of food seemed to be drawn to the holes. I didn’t resume solid food for about 3 weeks. 

Around February 1, 2019 I started Invisalign. There was just a tooth shaped space where my teeth were missing. This can look bad but mine weren’t too visible so i didn’t use anything to camouflage the spade, but your ortho can provide something for that if your space is prominent. 

The process for implants involves some preliminary xrays to make sure the bone looks like it’ll hold up, grafting if it doesn’t, placing a screw with a healing cap (the big screws in the above pic), then three months later later a “torque test” to make sure it’s really in there good. Then you have a crown made and placed onto the implant (that’s the “tooth”). 

I did 21 aligners and 4 refinement trays. I had my implants placed with two left. They didn’t fit well with the healing cap but I was able to wear them seamlessly after the procedure by trimming the bottom of the aligner so that it ended above the gum line and wouldn’t irritate. 

Because of my horrible extraction experience I went for sedation but it cost is an issue and you have to choose one, I would go sedation for the extraction and just novocaine for the screw - ideally have them put you out for both though. 

The crown placement is nice and easy. After the oral surgeon cleared me I went to my normal dentist with a special attachment from the surgeon. He took the healing caps off (painless but horrifying - definitely worried the whole screw would come out) placed the attachment and took impressions. Then put cap back. A few weeks later they were ready and I had them placed in 45 minutes. My dentist heavily recommended screw supported rather than abutment supported - ask about this if your provider doesn’t explain the difference! Implant failure is gross! 

My aligners didn’t fit over the new teeth but my ortho instructed me to cut my bottom ones off before the implant, which worked perfectly last night. And today I’m done! New teeth, who dis? 

Costs:

My Invisalign was quoted at $6,800 and that has covered everything. 

My two extractions with no sedation were $350, which insurance covered *retroactively*. 

For my implants, I had to fight with the oral surgeon to bill it to insurance in advance, but it was worth it. The cost of those were $2,700 a piece and sedation was about $400 extra. 

My crowns cost about $1500 each. 

Thanks for reading! Again - hope this helps someone get through the anxiety of a complicated treatment plan!"

Except they leave out the fact that you can and should train yourself to become mentally satisfied with an amount that leaves you physically satisfied. If you need more food for mental satisfaction than physical, ok maybe it’s from unrealistically trying to avoid junk forever - but your job then is to find an amount that makes you mentally satisfied without overshooting what your body needs."
fatlogic,fg3m451,t1_fg3kx06,1580484757.0,"To be fair, it *is* hard to get professional support to lose weight intentionally if you’ve ever had a restrictive ED in the past. In my experience even if you specify that you are seeking support in order to avoid falling into ED habits while losing, they act like losing weight is off limits to you now. Doesn’t mean you have to give up, just that it’s a barrier."
fatlogic,fg15tot,t1_fg0fd6d,1580421326.0,"I mean, I did used to occasionally break down when I had to go to a family event or something and I wanted to eat and planned on doing so but there was nothing there I felt safe eating. It’s not like that couldn’t happen as part of an eating disorder. But it also ignores that the *vast* majority of normal healthy people who are watching their intake just shrug and take a cookie and find some way to make up for it later. I do it all the time now AND I’m one of the people predisposed to ED, so it’s obvious that making dietary choices =/= automatic disorder lol."
fatlogic,fg14zu8,t3_ew9fo3,1580420860.0,"I personally think it’s the other way around - it’s hard to challenge your learned associations with food, form new coping mechanisms and practice healthy habits until they’re natural. Deciding to just accept your body rather than work on your maladaptive behaviors is the easy way out."
fatlogic,fg14nki,t1_fg0zl79,1580420667.0,"Agreed, I definitely feel like I’ve been in the scenario where I want to understand how my body works and why and I’m given too little explanation to figure that out. Even a starting point to do one’s own research helps."

loseit,fg0qpbd,t3_ew9ibv,1580413150.0,"Yeah...I’m short like you and from your weight to my current weight I went down 3 sizes really fast. Some clothes were secondhand and only worn a few times before they were too big because on shorter people ten lbs can make a big difference. If you can I’d wait as long as possible before buying and then go and actually try on to get the best fit. I didn’t follow this advice and my clothes were constantly running just a little big, which isn’t a bad problem to have but also not what you want if you’re looking to have a good time and feel great about yourself. Good luck!"
loseit,fg0pwyl,t3_ewachg,1580412714.0,"After several regains, I’m a lifelong tracker, or at least it looks like it at this point. I get that it may seem like it’s not ideal, but if I don’t hold myself accountable cognitive biases will get the best of me and the work of keeping an eye on things is way better than the work of losing a lot all over again. And I actually enjoy it - I think of it as some of the best self care I can engage in."

loseit,fg091lp,t3_ew1iw2,1580402826.0,"Your description tracks my personal approach to weight loss better than most that I see here - and I totally agree that maintenance is so hard. For me, trying/buying new clothing sizes was hugely rewarding, but I’m also trying to save now so I can’t reinforce myself that way. I’m trying to stay focused to dates in the future that I want to keep my current size through. I am good at losing weight, but historically bad at maintenance, so it’s taken a lot more pep talks from me to me when I want to reach for a snack, etc. I try to think about how much lighter I feel when I run now, how much easier stairs and hills are, etc. Congrats on your progress!!"
