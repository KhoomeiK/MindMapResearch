From an outsiders perspective this seems like a ""letter of the law, vs the spirit of the law"" issue. In the west we run a case-law system, where the letter of the law is written, but its meaning is defined as we go, because we understand that the written word can be interpreted in different ways, and there may be interesting loopholes appearing via different interpretations. For this reason I always think the letter of the law is of less importance than the spirit in which it was written.

There is more than one version of the Bill of Rights, each with slight varations in wording, but I will go with this version: 

> A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. 

as its the most commonly used and then look to what goal they were aiming for when they wrote it.

The 2A recognises that the government and the populace are two separate, different and opposing factions that could find themselves in a shooting war for supremacy. The purpose of the 2A is to grant the civilian population military parity with the government (The army) so that they can force the government out of power if it begins to turn to tyrany, and maintain freedom. The intention is for the government to lose this fight. Its not about self defence from criminals, or having an appropriate weapon for hunting. Its about bringing total defeat to a powerful, tyranical enemy in war.

Constant technological development means that when a new weapon is created it upsets the balance of power in favour of the army and damages the ability of the citizen to resit their government should the need arise. Again, the intention is for the government to lose this fight. To restore this balance, the civilians need to have access to, and training for, that weapon. 

The ""well regulated militia"" part seems to confuse the matter as who is defining ""well regulated""? Regulations are what government exists to create. If the fight is between the government and the people, but the government set the regulations , then what is to stop them reducing civilian weapons down to 6-shot revolvers or black-powder muskets? What idiot lets their enemy decide what they can fight with? The dead and the subjugated. 

Edit: ""Well regulated"" in the language of the time means ""correctly functioning or in good order"", and does not refer to government restrictions as it means in the modern sense. [Link.](https://constitution.org/cons/wellregu.htm) This changes the entire meaning of ""shall not be infringed"" to literally mean ""no restrictions at all""/Edit.

The spirit of the 2A is not served if your government has an armoury full of future tech, and the most your civilians have is bolt-action rifles. The civilian population cannot put up a fight with these restrictions, let alone win. Yes, that would mean that if the spirit of the 2A is upheld, then bubba and cletus get to have predator drones and battle tanks for no other reason than the army has them. ""As long as you are allowed to keep any gun at all then the right is upheld."" falls flat. The intention is for the government to lose this fight."

Would she think that she was in danger if it were another woman following her? If not, thats sexism. Literally deciding im a rapist based on being male.

> And detouring your route slightly is not a big hardship.

No, its not a big hardship, but thats not the point. I was asked if I had experienced sexism. Being thought a potential rapist by default is one of the ways men experience sexism. Ask the men in your life if they have ever had to go the long way round on this basis. See what they."

Thats a factually accurate statement.

In the UK we have muslim rape gangs targeting girls based solely on the fact they arent muslim and are therefore ""whores"" who have no rights. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal)

We have had Sharia patrols, where gangs of muslims harass non-muslims on the street for not following sharia. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcsG-u2GtZE&)

9/13 of the successful terror attacks over the last decade have been done by muslims. 5/6 failed terror plots were done by muslims. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents_in_Great_Britain#2000s)

2/3 muslims said they would not report known terror plots to the police. 50% said they would reverse gay rights. [Link](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/world/europe/poll-british-muslims.html)

We had islamic protests against the existance of our police force in ""their communities"" and reject integration. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2nlIfn8tNA&t=42s)

They have pushed to have halal slaughter despite our animal cruelty laws. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halal#Halal_in_UK_shops)

Show me the hindu equivalent of these and I will concede the point. Untill then I have no choice but to say that islam is an agressive, authoritarian ideology that breeds anti-western attitudes and activity. It is middle-eastern, theocratic fascism. Anti-islamism is a staunchly liberal position. Embracing islam will casue us to suffer the paradox of tolerance."
