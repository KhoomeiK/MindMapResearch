It’s these same ppl that dry their booty cracks and face with the same towel lol! I’ll try to remember this tip. Hopefully my towels have tags. They’re pretty old. I almost went as far as cutting a little piece off one of the corner as a reminder. Seemed a bit extra!"
ContagiousLaughter,fdlp0b9,t1_fdke6on,1578529063.0,This gotdamn is funnier than the damn post! I am in tears and I can’t stop laughing. Wth is wrong w me!
narcissism,fdgsr50,t3_egf4o0,1578407373.0,You are underestimating this disorder and overestimating your ability to cope with it. There is no strategy other than working your way out of the relationship. Period.
Codependency,fd7jppa,t3_eji59c,1578205581.0,"Yes. It’s as if I don’t process anything that’s happening in my daily life. As if each day is its own separate lifetime, idk. Ppl ask me about things all the time and I have no recollection of it or it takes me awhile to remember."
NarcissisticAbuse,fd68499,t1_fd5uoqb,1578186939.0,"Ppl are so confusing. I’ve become so intrigued by human behavior and personality disorders. 

Aw. I am thankful as well. It can be hard finding ppl that can relate so these micro conversations are such an inspiration to continue to learn in order to grow. You are so correct about your statement on survivors. I am so much more aware. Now in my late 30’s I have come to truly understand cliques such as,  “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” or when ppl say bad experiences made them who they are. Never got it in my younger years. 

Be blessed and always reach out if you want to talk. 💜"
wholesomememes,fd4z4so,t3_ejxkef,1578172612.0,"I am a female. Moved in to help my dad while he’s divorcing. I’ve always been handy. No idea where it came from but Ive been teaching my son from a young age (he’s now 13).  I often tell my dad that me or my son will fix something bc Dad isn’t handy at all and he’s old so there’s that. His response to me is ALWAYS  “ you don’t know what you’re doing, let me call Mr. Joey”. Smh it drives me insane. He still doubts us and we prove him wrong every time. My mom calls me instead of my bro. Once, my dad mentioned something needing to be done in the house around my mother; she got his usual response. She was not having it. She set his ass straight 😂"
GetMotivated,fd4pdss,t1_fd4ftpk,1578169734.0,I just asked this question in a previous comment on this thread. What makes one continue the cycle or live to break it. Developing empathy is that factor for sure. It’s amazing how two ppl in the same situation (bro and sis) can grow up together yet go in opposite directions as a result of trauma and abuse. I know everyone is wired differently which I’m sure dictates the trauma response. It’s just fascinating and sad.
GetMotivated,fd4ntau,t1_fd42v3v,1578169268.0,"Yes. I wonder what dictates which way one would go. I definitely am a healer, to a fault."
GetMotivated,fd4kvif,t1_fd40hw3,1578168521.0,"That’s something I don’t understand either. I live everyday trying NOT to be who my mother was (alcoholic, not present, cheater) but my two others siblings replicated her in atleast one of those ways. It was so traumatic growing up I can’t for the life of me understand how they could be the same way to their children."
NarcissisticAbuse,fd4jfuh,t1_fd49r5k,1578168050.0,"His response was very very immature. I do find that Narcs just don’t give a fuck (and not in a good badass way). They’re so self absorbed that I bet he found no harm in that ignorant ass response. They can be so subtly/passively disrespectful. I can imagine the confusion when he said you should stop seeing each other. I do think it’s a manipulative strategy of theirs to come on strong knowing they have no intentions of anything serious.  The guy I met did just that. The irony of our stories, now that I’m thinking about it. My guy always talked about how attracted to me he was and what he wanted to do to me sexually. I get we have good chemistry but sex talk the first week, ideally should be a no. 

So ultimately I think he just wanted sex, only difference, he didn’t flat out say I’m horny all the time BUT he damn sure was!

Don’t be too hard on yourself about going back after a breakup, we all do it. But it’s good that you notice the patterns and are working on it."
funny,fd0ra8p,t1_fb742yn,1578122694.0,I absolutely need more!
NarcissisticAbuse,fczzha2,t1_fcza81u,1578111304.0,"Yesss exact same! Butterflies mixed with intense anxiety perfectly explains it. He also did a 180. Went from I reallly really like you to kind of disappearing. Actions not matching words are nope for me.  1. He talked badly about ex wife 2. Told me he just learned that she might be bugging his phone so be careful what I text him. 3. Super intense feelings first week then faded. 

All clear signs of who he really is. Did you stop talking to him?"
NarcissisticAbuse,fcwdqa7,t1_fcv1m6w,1578023050.0,This happened to me with a guy recently. We had a great connection but I was getting a weird feeling in my stomach when I was going to see him. It was like the butterflies you get when youre nerve-scited but it was different. Felt as if my body was warning me about something. I was confused bc he didn’t do anything out of the ordinary. And then after a few meetings he revealed himself. I was like holy shit did my body know before I did! It was really strange. He’s def a narc.
NarcissisticAbuse,fcwb6ks,t1_fcv18yb,1578021358.0,Gosh yes to these points!
blackpeoplegifs,fcwb02d,t3_ej274r,1578021240.0,I remember seeing this before and thinking “that spotter is finnne! Where can I find him”.  Yep still think he’s fine and wondering where I can find him  🥰
LifeAfterNarcissism,fcwanz5,t3_ej1um3,1578021013.0,"This post gave me the clarity I needed! I am being enlightened left and right on reddit these days. I’ve been struggling with thoughts of him while at the same time despising him. I’m like wtf is this. I don’t want to be with him but why can’t I get over him. It’s not him, it’s the abuse that is lingering. I can not get over the way he treated me and the trauma it has caused. I think we all understate the trauma, I know I do. So when I’m experiencing certain feelings I don’t always know how to identify them or what to identify them as (If that makes sense). Ugh what a mess! 
Thanks for the post."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fcwa7i3,t1_fcvpolv,1578020708.0,Omg. How?
LifeAfterNarcissism,fcwa14f,t1_fcvcedr,1578020591.0,Thank you for this article. Thank you.
FemaleDatingStrategy,fcw7902,t3_ej0i5t,1578018755.0,"This post is absolutely true. I defended myself and my character so much with my ex narcissist and unreasonably so.  I was doing nothing wrong yet I was always explaining to deaf ears. Now the minute I feel like I’m defending myself, my character and sometimes even my position on things I immediately withdraw. I think it comes across to the other person as me being defeated or not being able to support my position but really it’s just a trauma response. Most times I can’t  muster the energy to entertain those types of conversations even when I think I should. For me, I feel as if I’m trying to maintain inner peace vs peace between me and the other person. I don’t know how to engage/rebut without being extremely triggered."
youngandtherestless,fcthhtb,t1_fcoerde,1577943442.0,I’m watching for the first time in awhile and I can not believe what I’m seeing. How does Adam convince these women that they really want him. And Why! Just why. Sharon was just the love of his life now it’s Chelsea smh this is so silly.

LifeAfterNarcissism,fcp3x68,t3_ei65wc,1577849699.0,"As I prepare to put him on block at 12:01am, I come here to help work my way up to having the courage. At the same time, I’m  hoping that he reaches out and says something that’ll change my mind while simultaneously praying that if he does reach out I will have the courage to ignore him. This post helped tremendously. Thank you."
NarcissisticAbuse,fcp2wc2,t3_eiaimg,1577848810.0,That’s something to be extremely proud of. Sit in that.
NarcissisticAbuse,fcfrgea,t3_eh1i7m,1577633029.0,"This is an interesting question that I would love to know the answer to. My Nex doesn’t drink, no drugs or video games and also doesn’t have many friends. I’ve stopped by his house unannounced many times when I saw his car and he’d be sitting alone watching tv on a Friday or Saturday night. Now that I know that he’s a narcissist, I imagine when we were in a relationship but not physically together he spent alone time talking to other women via text, social media or physically being with them. Also his kids live with him so I’m sure he spent his evenings with them when not we me. Idk"
Empaths,fbxpzyr,t1_fbxoso9,1577197235.0,Yes yes yes I have that feeling of not being able to swallow all the time. I’m also glad I’m not the only one but it does suck. I really appreciate finding this reddit community.
Empaths,fbxlamn,t1_fbx4bwn,1577192619.0,Same here.
Empaths,fbxl6s1,t1_fbxj8o7,1577192499.0,"Asking the question has helped me tremendously. I would most times just go through the day being anxious, grumpy and bothered. I somehow learned to immediately stop when my mood changes out of nowhere and try to identify the “thing”.  Identifying won’t stop the feeling from coming back BUT it will subside temporarily and then when it comes back I’ll remember. Unfortunately, by the time the feeling comes back I’ll be identifying 2-3 more things. 

Thank you. I’m not always calm and objective. I will remember that."
Empaths,fbxkz3z,t1_fbx8ocw,1577192259.0,Precisely! That pit in the stomach is perpetually there.
Empaths,fbxkwta,t1_fbwza7k,1577192185.0,Yes!!!!! Omg I could cry knowing ppl identify with this. Yes it can be the simplest thing that’ll mess with you all day. Wow I’m so glad I wrote this out.
Empaths,fbxkton,t1_fbwz9yu,1577192084.0,Wow! I never ever thought that I would be able to identify with anyone on this.
Empaths,fbwntyx,t3_ebx3ac,1577154788.0,I trigger myself all the time!
Empaths,fbw2hl5,t1_fbtl5qk,1577139682.0,That’s great. I should absolutely make it a daily routine.
