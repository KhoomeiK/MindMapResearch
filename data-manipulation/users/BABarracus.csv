nottheonion,ffvf4je,t1_ffvc9yl,1580262654.0,"Oh and what if the teacher was always 5 minutes late and get fired or the person who is supposed to unlock the doors to the building. In the case of some elementary schools that means children can't get in if the person who is supposed to unlock the door isnt there. What if the nurse that was supposed relieve their coworkers showed up late.

By your logic those people wernt valued because their boss didnt think its ok for them to show up late to work and fired them.

A real job shows that it values its employees by giving bonuses, Paid time off, health insurance, retirement, raises every year ect. Allowing people to be late is just a tactic to not give out other benefits."
