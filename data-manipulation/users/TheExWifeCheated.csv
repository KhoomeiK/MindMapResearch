That doesn't apply to Trump though, and all of the economic growth under him are entirely his for #reasons. /s 

I've had these discussions with my own asshole conservative dad. His claim is that economic policy takes 8-10 years to take effect, because this shows conservatives in the most positive light by riding the waves from democratic policy. 

Really it's more like presidential policy affects things for 1-2 years. The economy struggled from 2002 to 2009, it was in controlled healthy improvement from 2009 to 2019. Both of these periods correspond to the president's effects. 

Now the economy is bubble-building into an unstable unhealthy improvement that precedes a crash, which we can expect in 2020-2021, and corresponding economic struggle until 2022 or 2024. 

We're going to be trouble until 2024 no matter who is in office. The person in office starting in 2021 is going to determine whether the trouble ends in 2024 or just drags on until the USA finishes morphing into evangelical-bald-eagle-russia."

My last boss was that way in software development. I would usually have a perfectly fine implementation of a solution, he would say ""no do it this way"", make me rebuild it, and it would come out slower and higher maintenance. He took over from the guy who hired me, then my performance and code quality both plummeted. 

I have ten years dev experience. I know how to make a button do a thing when it is clicked. There's no need to make a button that does everything when you only need it to do one thing. Finally, using obscure techniques for creating dynamic self-building software to solve single-case problems does not reduce the maintenance load if nobody in the future can read the code or if future debugging/extension is impossible.
