facepalm,feaiq2u,t1_feace51,1578949313.0,"Diamonds have a high compression strength and high wear resistance, making them ideal for machining tools and abrasive discs. You can't really crush a diamond, but you can cut it along ""weak points"" in its internal structure which can differ between jewellery-grade and industrial-grade diamonds. 

For a bullet-proof vest, you want a material that can absorb a lot of kinetic energy at a very fine point i.e. a knife or bullet. Such a material needs a high level of shock resistance so a hard material such as diamond wouldn't be very suitable.
