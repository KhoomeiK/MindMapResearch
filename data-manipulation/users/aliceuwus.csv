depression,fejeatz,t1_feje8m8,1579169885.0,"Oh yes definitely, my only motivation is pleasing others and doing what is expected of me, but recently I’ve begun caring about that far less and thus I’ve become more lazy"
depression,fejdwta,t1_fejdlyy,1579169296.0,"I moved up a stage in terms of my education which I suppose knocked me a bit, as it would to anyone, but I dealt with it. I think it’s more that I’ve been overworking myself to try and “not be depressed” and now everything is finally getting beyond the point of ignoring it, but it’s just frustrating because I cannot tell whether I’m just trying to find an excuse for not trying now by saying I overworked or whether I actually was just doing what was expected of me and now I’m just taking a back seat hm.."
depression,fejcn1p,t1_feif3ku,1579167371.0,"Thank you for your comment, I don’t really want to give up hope just yet despite how dreadful it feels as of right now so thanks for reminding me of that."
depression,fejcev5,t1_feikvhm,1579167019.0,"I’m sorry to hear you’re feeling this way too, I definitely notice that I’ve started more reckless thought patterns because I’m losing hope in getting better too tbh but I guess somewhere deep within me I have some hope or desire to survive or I should’ve had the courage to kill myself already right? Maybe that’s too optimistic but I really hope it’s true, and true for you too."
depression,fejcaq9,t1_fej72a1,1579166846.0,"For real though, like does this guy really think I haven’t tried.. I wouldn’t admit to myself I had depression for many years because I wanted to “get over it” or distract myself from it by immersing myself in other things and pretending it wasn’t there but now I’m getting worse everyday. Just trying to go out and “make something” of myself won’t make it better..."
depression,fejc558,t1_feip3kc,1579166611.0,"aha that’s actually really accurate though, like somehow I thought completing some aspects of my life (exams, school etc) would make me feel better and like I had some meaning but now that I’ve completed them I feel even more lost and realise I didn’t really think I would get this far and complete them"
depression,fejc0sj,t1_feit0i8,1579166426.0,"I’m sorry to hear you can relate to this too, it feels like it would be so much easier and logical for me to be dead but getting the courage to do it is hard. I do try and think more positively, like if I find it hard to get the courage to really attempt suicide then maybe it’s a sign that I shouldn’t kill myself (yet at least) and I should at least keep trying to fight depression until it’s bearable or I get the courage to kill myself for real (preferably the first option though)"
depression,fejbuio,t1_feittpd,1579166166.0,"Thanks for your comment, and don’t you worry I’m already on the crying out all my feelings part I’m kind of just sick of bottling up my feelings anymore."
depression,fejbsxl,t1_feiuqhk,1579166099.0,I get this feeling too.. I feel like the world should and could go on without me if I didn’t get up and do what I’m supposed to do.
depression,fejbnqt,t1_feivh3j,1579165886.0,"Yeah, same. I’m just doing work and responsibilities that are expected of me and just wading my way through life with these distractions as my sole motivation, but it’s getting increasingly harder to even bother with them anymore and my mind is just slipping into imagining I’ve already given up and going to die soon, without actually making plans to kill myself so I’m just spiralling but not ending it. I don’t know whether you feel the same?"
depression,fejbjbu,t1_feivio2,1579165703.0,"Yeah that’s actually a good analogy too, I’m sorry you have to feel this way as well but I’m glad it gives you some sort of comfort to know others feel this way too."
depression,fejb8hw,t1_fej0ieq,1579165251.0,Although having this freedom can lead to some bad decision making and avoiding work and responsibilities etc sadly
teenagers,feia8ni,t1_fei9zpx,1579133784.0,I mean I’d respect someone who changed their mind and agreed with “no I’m not” bc I brought that upon myself but yeah i can get that it’s annoying af to not accept compliments .... still probably going to dispute them tho oops
