The stove looked like it needed to be replaced.  The whole unit looked hacked together like someone with little construction experience made a duplex out of a single family home.  You could hear the neighbors arguing as if they were in the same room.  I said something through the bedroom wall to them as a joke. Owner advertised it as having having a washing machine but they were in the other unit.  There's more; but I digress. We were only supposed to be there for one night so I rolled with it but took pictures of all the weirdness.  Closed the windows, went out to dinner.  When we came back you could smell it from outside the house.  Opened the door and it smelled like sewer.  Neighbors were running the washing machine (the whole time we were there) and there were suds and hair in our tub that shared the wall with the washer.  My SO couldn't take the horrible smell so I threw out stuff into our rental car and messaged the owner about what happened and told him I expected a refund.  Mind you this was now 9:45 at night.  Drove us the hotel we were supposed to stay the next night, which was an hour away.  He texted me while we were driving trying to get me to stay in another place he had in town.  Yeah, burn me once.. He played the game of not leaving feedback for a long time.  I took the high road by not posting harsh feedback for him.  But worked directly with Air Bnb to make sure I got my money back and messaged them my feedback and offered to send pics, but they never took me up on it.
