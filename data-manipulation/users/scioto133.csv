onewheel,fff94qn,t1_ffek3cd,1579878777.0,It was just a little kick
onewheel,ffeic4f,t3_et19o3,1579849182.0,Dude I thought I was the only one this has happened to. I did this once without knowing it was a glitch and it just shot out from under my feet fully power
onewheel,ffd7pur,t3_esutc8,1579815042.0,Trust me when I say that getting a Onewheel is life changing. Make sure you start of in the grass for a few hours. I would recommend all pads but the most important IMO is wrist guards and a helmet.
onewheel,ffd02or,t1_ffcrig9,1579810774.0,Yeah I just went for a ride this morning and it felt amazing! The new pads were definitely money well spent along with the flight fins. I feel like I have way better control over the board now.
onewheel,ffczvx8,t1_ffcamwm,1579810670.0,Yeah they fixed it free of charge but all they said was that there was something wrong with the controller and they had to replace it.
onewheel,ffc6jv1,t1_ffc01uf,1579792701.0,The board kept turning off while I was riding it and then one time it started flashing red and I got a notification saying there was incompatible software.
onewheel,ff8rgy3,t3_es5yn2,1579693129.0,Wow I really like the red it looks nice. Also the sidekicks are sick too!
onewheel,ff7p7ie,t3_erejmx,1579654985.0,Oh I guess that makes more sense
Deji,ff6vo05,t3_epdfbv,1579635828.0,Bro that’s fucked up. If I was there I would fuck the shit out of that guy
Deji,ff64m2z,t3_ernfdb,1579618998.0,I’ve never been more uncomfortable than when I watched this video.
onewheel,ff54yvy,t1_fezjrb6,1579580377.0,Or just in case you didn’t know you can buy them on craft and ride.com
onewheel,ff54sou,t1_ff547ed,1579580239.0,Okay thanks! Why do people leave on the existing grip tape? Wouldn’t that just make it harder to replace the grip tape when it needs to be replaced?
onewheel,ff5431c,t1_ff53pj5,1579579668.0,Is your warranty still valid? They might have forgotten to put the charger hole and on/off button on it. I’m sure it’s an easy fix and i hope fm does it for free. Good luck!
onewheel,ff53yjw,t1_ff53n7n,1579579572.0,Oh my bad. Sorry I keep mixing up foot pad with grip tape. I just got some foam grip tapes from craft n ride for Christmas and I’m looking to put them on tomorrow.  I don’t want to rip the censor off so I was wandering how you can be safe about it.
onewheel,ff52xyu,t1_ff0bfio,1579578786.0,Wait can you explain to me the process of replacing a footpad? I’m getting my pint back tomorrow after I had to get it repaired and I’m going to replace the footpads but now I’m scared to.
onewheel,ff52rgn,t1_ff2hsj2,1579578647.0,I had the same noise coming from my pint. I thought something was loose or broken so I contacted fm and they said it was fine. But I recently had an issue where my pint kept spurning off while I was riding and I had to send it in to get the controller replaced. Getting it back tomorrow so I can’t wait!
onewheel,ff52a8l,t3_erejmx,1579578283.0,"It’s honestly up to you. I have a pint and it works just fine for me. The only difference between the two is that the car has more range and the pint is more maneuverable meaning you can carve more and you feel like you have more control over it. 

They both have the same amount of power and I’m pretty sure that the only reason the XR is faster is because it has a different type of battery which can affect how much power is given to the motor at a time ( you can correct me if you think I’m wrong, I’m not a 100% sure about this but it seems most logical). I have the pint and it gets up the steepest hills with absolutely no issue and I weigh same as you. 

Also it doesn’t matter at all weather you have snowboarded before or not. I just recommend that you spent your first 4 hours or so on a flat bed of grass to practice. I’ve never snowboarded and I am really good with it now it just takes practice. 

I hope this helps! Good luck making a choice!"
onewheel,ff51e4q,t3_erjw9p,1579577612.0,I love how you have a warning for vertical video lol. If you didn’t tell me that I wouldn’t have been prepared and probably would have had a heart attack
onewheel,ff51akv,t3_erne0r,1579577537.0,Have you tried giving it a protein shake? That should work
teenagers,few4xz4,t3_eqn16s,1579405437.0,Just pull your balls out and walk into the room
onewheel,fetykq5,t1_fenc63m,1579381350.0,Wait I’m confused. Is the white part the footpad sensor? I’m replacing my footpads soon and I don’t know how to
onewheel,fettw6m,t1_fes0vik,1579380027.0,Yeah it’s been frustrating. I tried calling them but after 2 hours on hold I just decided to wait for an email respond which ended up taking about a month. I’m hoping they get it fixed by the end of next week.
onewheel,fettgx8,t1_fetjvf3,1579379877.0,Yeah they can tell if you put something back together wrong so that can ward your warranty. Anyway I hope they get the board fixed by then end of next week. I’ve got a lot of accessories that I’m waiting to put on it.
onewheel,fersd5y,t1_ferbbvn,1579357816.0,Yeah they don’t have the fastest customer service or service in general. Just be patient. I know it sucks but they just don’t have enough people working there.
onewheel,fers2cu,t1_fepvck6,1579357720.0,I did get hurt one time but the others I was either in short grass or on the trail.
onewheel,ferq9k9,t1_fepknbf,1579357108.0,Yeah but I would rather have them put it in because I didn’t know how to. I agree though their service is way too slow.
onewheel,ferpzyx,t1_fephqf3,1579357030.0,Yeah it also took them a month and a half just to email me back the shipping info. They don’t have the best customer service or service in general.
onewheel,fepfyu9,t3_eq8l5k,1579319529.0,How much was the whole package?
onewheel,fep2xzu,t3_eq5k4a,1579310952.0,That’s good. I wander if you could ask them to just give you a pro for half off. If my handle breaks I’m going to ask them if they can because I would much rather have a pro.
onewheel,feow2o6,t3_eq5k4a,1579306653.0,Ok this is starting to make me mad. Onewheel shouldn’t be selling handles that are just going to break before 500 miles. You can order a new handle on the fm website but if your warranty is still good then fm should replace it for you. I’ve been seeing a new post every day about people with this problem and it’s frustrating. I would suggest getting the mag handle pro because it’s made of metal.
onewheel,fems3me,t3_enwl0s,1579268016.0,Good! I’m glad your recovery’s going well!
onewheel,fem8nza,t3_enwl0s,1579243803.0,How are the hands? Are they recovering well?
onewheel,feimr74,t1_feiizn6,1579142165.0,"Yeah but fm wouldn’t recommend it if it was unsafe. I wouldn’t be too scared to do it, I’ve done it plenty of times. Gl!"
onewheel,fehv210,t3_ep6xec,1579124436.0,I’m seeing way too many posts about their handles breaking. It’s sad that they are made with such poor quality. I might just buy a pro now cause I don’t want to drop my board later on.
onewheel,fefwt65,t1_fef04nk,1579067784.0,Try plugging your pint in for 48 hours straight. Fm recommends that you do this every once and a while to balance  the battery cells. Let me know if this helps!
onewheel,fefwo2t,t1_fee5au2,1579067647.0,My email was taking too long so my dad sent a frustrated email and they responded in about an hour
onewheel,fefstdu,t3_eou2kq,1579064137.0,Looks sexy
onewheel,fearnrt,t3_enxghm,1578951616.0,That’s sick!

onewheel,fe9fowe,t3_eni7ai,1578937151.0,Mine didn’t have tax
onewheel,fe9bptf,t3_eo2rhx,1578936119.0,It’s worth it I love those side guards. I wanna get some for my pint
onewheel,fe8qnpa,t1_fe8kqvg,1578929421.0,Dang well as long as you had a good time it was worth it!
onewheel,fe67z3l,t3_enwl0s,1578883793.0,Dang that looks extremely painful. Some dogs are very unpredictable and if he was behind a fence than that was probably pretty hard to see it coming considering most people aren’t paying attention to literally everything around them when they ride. Sometimes things like this happen but I definitely feel bad considering it was kind of unavoidable because at the time you didn’t know the dog was gonna jump the fence. Hope the recovery process goes well and make sure to wear wrist guards next time!
dankmemes,fe60ddz,t3_enncyl,1578878966.0,I love that website. I used to play it in science 8th grade lol thanks for the nostalgia
onewheel,fe607lb,t3_envtcy,1578878861.0,"If your really concerned I would send it in to have it looked at but as long as it works I think it’s fine. I can’t believe some of the people in the world and I hope you and your board are ok (mainly you). People like that shouldn’t ever be driving. 
EVER.. just keep a lookout next time, I’m not saying it was your fault, I’m saying that it’s the other persons fault that you should pay attention Because they can’t drive correctly. Be safe!!!"
onewheel,fe5yid2,t3_enqcsw,1578877780.0,Get a fender lol
onewheel,fdte70p,t3_emxqpl,1578715486.0,That’s sick dude. By far one of the best looking pints I’ve seen.
onewheel,fdpufp3,t3_emgx7w,1578640926.0,That looks beautiful
onewheel,fdgmo13,t3_ekmzty,1578402434.0,It definitely is!
onewheel,fdgmn16,t3_ekmzty,1578402409.0,"Yeah true.
I can’t wait to try it all out!"
onewheel,fddr753,t1_fdd21or,1578321839.0,I’m not sure which one it is.
onewheel,fdd20hd,t1_fdd1xyn,1578291632.0,Yeah it said incomparable software.
onewheel,fdcwy7q,t1_fdcmzbw,1578286738.0,"While I’m riding it, it will either just turn off or the wheel will completely lock and both ways I’ll fly off of it and get hurt. I wouldn’t worry about having any issues with yours, these things don’t break often or easily so I was probably just unlucky. Have fun riding!"
onewheel,fdcj5nq,t3_ekmzty,1578276199.0,I just sent my pint in for repair 2 weeks ago and I got all this stuff for Christmas! Now I’ve got to wait until I get it back. Hopefully it doesn’t take too long!
teenagers,fd9qtpm,t3_ekc1zu,1578236871.0,I know how that feels and it pretty much ruins your week... sorry man
depression,fd7rnpm,t3_ek60m6,1578209030.0,It’s because we take all of the happiness that is supposed to go toward ourselves and instead give it to other people.i would rather everyone else be happy than me.also don’t feel like everything you do is wrong it’s not true. I hope you have an amazing 2020!
teenagers,fd7qod7,t3_ek7tow,1578208587.0,"
Don’t worry she just realized that she wasn’t good enough for you. For real though you’ll find another girl out there she just wasn’t quite the right one for you."
teenagers,fd7q97f,t3_ek7lld,1578208402.0,I can’t believe you family would treat you like that. Definitely let someone you trust most know so they can help you. Good luck!
teenagers,fd7jb92,t3_ek7202,1578205417.0,He couldn’t be given any for of punishment wtf??? That’s bs and I hope that kid gets in a car accident and dies. I hope your doing well now.

depression,fd720n7,t1_fd5yrfu,1578198463.0,Thank you. I’m not sure if I can just forget about those people because I hate knowing that they are in so much mental pain and I just want to help them.
dankmemes,fd3umd6,t3_eju6qn,1578161740.0,We won’t learn about it if we lived through it. It’s the next generation that’s fucked
onewheel,fcsyo11,t1_fcsn8pa,1577928417.0,Unfortunately I don’t have the kush pad.
depression,fcskmje,t3_eikclj,1577918492.0,"I’m so so sorry for your loss.

I know exactly how you feel, my mom also died of cancer and she was only 39 and me 7. It was by far the worst day of my life and to this day 8 years later I still wish that I had spent more time with her. I know it’s not easy getting through it but it will get better I promise. Still to this day I’ll think of her and cry myself to sleep, the pain will never fully go away but that’s okay because that means you’ll never forget her.

My mom was an artist so every year on the day she died, my dad sister and I will spend that day painting a beautiful picture onto a canvas. I suggest you do something similar, think of something you guys loved doing together and do it. There may be some tears involved but it will make you feel better in the end. 

Also don’t think that it was your fault, I don’t really know how to explain why you shouldn’t think it was your fault but just know that in the future you’ll realize that you were too hard on yourself. 

I hope you do okay and I wish for your 2020 to get better. May your mom Rest In Peace."
onewheel,fcsife8,t1_fcsbdtt,1577917104.0,Agreed. I personally think that anyone riding a Onewheel should at least have a helmet and wrist guards.
onewheel,fcsi916,t3_einpo8,1577917009.0,"I would totally recommend flight fins. They look super cool and they make you feel like your more in control of the board. Also just an idea, there are storage accessories for the pint that straps onto the fender so you can put some of your stuff in there like a wallet, charger, water etc."
dankmemes,fcr8iff,t3_eigqvq,1577898326.0,"My sister got a 50% on her final

depression,fcpfqu3,t3_eibb6g,1577862004.0,Some people are just like that and you have to just ignore them. I don’t know why some people are like this but is pisses me off because they know nothing about you and just judge you because of what you look like. Luckily there’s a thing called karma that is going to hit her in the face when she doesn’t see it coming. Have an amazing 2020!!
teenagers,fcpfbre,t3_eicf45,1577861493.0,"Wait is it new years for you guys already? It’s only 8:50 for me rn. Also your very pretty, you should be more confident about yourself."

onewheel,fchp0pr,t3_eh6vp6,1577652630.0,Awesome!! I think the red fender is the best color but I got the black one when I originally got my pint and regretted it. Looks great though!
onewheel,fcc4dqp,t3_dzrjmh,1577594277.0,Wait are these rails going to be limited quantity or are they going to be a regular item in the shop?
onewheel,fcc3p7t,t3_eh093s,1577594058.0,Wait so is there a limited amount of these once they come out? I’m confused
onewheel,fca9j1z,t1_fc88ip9,1577565174.0,Nice I’m at 233 on my pint. Just wandering what is the biggest difference between your pint and your xr besides battery life? Also is your pint a lot more noisy than your xr?
teenagers,fc7kylo,t1_fc75uu8,1577510797.0,IKR it’s not easy lol
teenagers,fc7ke33,t3_ege101,1577510252.0,I might be wrong about this but it’s possible that she was super nervous and said no but then regretted it so she made a lie up. Idk tho I’ve never had a gf before lol.
