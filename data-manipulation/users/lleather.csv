ibs,ff7cfcz,t1_ff6rrgk,1579646304.0,"People are fools. When you lose (or gain) lots of weight suddenly and unintentionally, something is wrong. While some nausea isn't that unusual, lots of vomiting is unusual for IBS as far as I know, if you haven't already seen a gastro and possibly get endoscopy (or something a bit less invasive if they have it) maybe you should. Not a doctor here..just find what you said a bit unusual. Good luck!"
ibs,ff6k0zs,t3_ervtdb,1579628851.0,"I seem to have the opposite problem. I have IBS and people are constantly commenting that if only I got skinny it would fix it. I've repeatedly said that I know plenty of skinny people who have IBS. But that doesn't shut them up.

 I wish people would mind their damn business."

aww,fewj7tq,t1_feuk40p,1579411679.0,"Some fancy stores or specialized shops have rabbit. It's available, but you can't get it everywhere.

People who live in rural areas will sometimes eat it. People in urban or suburban areas usually don't, unless they are interested in unusual food. You can find it if you're looking for it, but you might have to go out of your way, especially in the Northeast USA where I live."
aww,feshaym,t1_fes8adc,1579365104.0,"I am so sorry. :(  I think we sometimes forget that oppression builds very confusing and upsetting symbols for people who are minorities or for people who live in unsafe countries. Something that looks benign or innocuous as a white American might be really scary for a person of color or for someone who lived through an authoritarian government. One example would be that some refugees fear dogs because their governments regularly used to let them loose on people (or at least kept them hungry and perpetually angry). Whatever they saw one, they represented Danger. They weren't cute puppers."

ibs,fectl1z,t1_fe6lccb,1578984092.0,"I'm glad I could help. Definitely read some of the comments below. They have some helpful advice. think a referral to a gastro is important no matter what else you do. If only to rule out something more serious than IBS.

But more than anything, make sure you get someone who listens to you. A lot of medical professionals have decided what's up in 10 seconds. They aren't going to investigate. Make sure you get an advocate!"
LifeProTips,fe6ni7o,t3_ens0wi,1578897066.0,"This is very helpful for tasks that can be broken up this way, such as cleaning your room. There are some jobs that don't really work this way because you don't have a sense of the scope until you've got your hands well into the guts of the thing... and sometimes, not even then.

I would say for 90% of all work, you are absolutely correct.

For tasks where stages aren't clear, or some experimentation or creativity is necessary in order to proceed, I would argue that perhaps instead of breaking it into tasks, you can do some thinking about how to organize the time that you have. You can also make a backup plan, in case you're really stuck. At that point, you can probably create some kind of discrete task list.

ProgrammerHumor,fe6mt1r,t3_enrcyo,1578896307.0,"Yeah, this is definitely my current annoyance. If you think it's so goddamn easy and shouldn't take this long, why don't you do it yourself?"
ibs,fe6k5xk,t3_enz60v,1578893561.0,"I know several people that have embarrassing or really confusing gastrointestinal issues that aren't getting resolved. If it's your primary care provider that is not helping you, maybe see if you can get referred to a specialist. As the previous poster mentioned,  is it possible  this is some sort of infection? Have they checked your blood work? Also, if all you've gotten is only an x-ray so far, maybe it's time to get a colonoscopy and endoscopy. This doesn't sound like a normal case of IBS, but I'm not a doctor. Definitely , you need more tests. 

It's also worth asking other members of your family, since they've been through this, if this matches their symptoms at all and what they did about it, if anything.

You need to find yourself someone who will advocate for you, preferably someone with some medical training. If you can't find that, then see if you can find a family member, school counselor, or social worker who will.

None of this is your fault. Things like this happen and sometimes we don't know why. Very often it's something completely unexpected, but no one did the work to find out.

In the meantime, one thing you might want to try is to track when the symptoms are the worst. Does it change with what you eat or how often? How you sleep? What medication you are on? What your emotional state is? Does it make a difference what time of day it is?

Do you notice the smell yourself when you are alone? Does it seem to get noticeably worse with stress? Are you bleeding or discharging mucus? Do you have any other symptoms? Are you getting fevers? 

Write all the stuff down and mention it to the medical professional you speak to. They can look for patterns. You may have to go through a couple of different docs until you find someone willing to really dig into it."

ibs,fdu4f6e,t3_en3x50,1578727350.0,"It is very possible to have uncomfortable pressure around your heart. 

 It could very well be gastrointestinal, but don't just assume that it is. Depending on your age and physical health, I might go to the doctor about it just in case it's cardiac. It's best to err on the side of caution. Don't be ashamed of asking them to test you. It's better to go through a couple of unnecessary tests than have a life-threatening medical emergency.

Have had trips to the ER that ended up being really bad gas, really bad acid reflux, or panic attacks. They were all happening at a time in my life when my stress was extremely intense and the feelings were new to me at the time. I didn't know what to do.

But once they confirm that it's not a life-threatening matter for you, consider having some gas medication and antacids on hand. Both of those things will mimic chest pain. Anxiety will also do that. :\  

It's also a good idea to have some peppermint and ginger available. Peppermint really helps with upset stomach and nausea, but it does cause acid flare-ups for some folks. If you're prone to that, avoid it.

Ginger is good for nausea, and is generally soothing."
ibs,fdpp07e,t3_emd1u6,1578635161.0,"Coffee is one of triggers. If you happen to have ibs-c it's probably not as bad. For the D folks, I wouldn't recommend it."

tea,fdpf2pd,t3_emjw81,1578626976.0,"I like Harney & Sons ""African Autumn"". It's a Roibois Tisane not a true tea, but it's very nice. It's earthy but also a little fruity. No caffeine so it's kind of relaxing. It's just the tiniest bit sweet so it doesn't need sugar. It was my go-to for a long time. There is a very similar tea called Cranberry Autumn, which is great, but not the same thing. It's a good, caffeinated fruity black tea. 

 Teas with lemon and chamomile together are also very nice at night."
LifeProTips,fdmfh1r,t1_fdlwick,1578548149.0,This made me chuckle. Thank you.

LARP,fdcszw8,t3_ekiuuo,1578283466.0,"I did this for a long time. You'll want to find something that binds your chest. Maybe a Spanx covered by a sports bra. Masculine clothes over that. It's hot indoors, but it works.

In terms of acting I've played both real and fake males before, and I'm biologically female. By real I mean my character was a real male. By fake, I mean my character was a female pretending to be a male.

You'll probably want some kind of a tell. Not a really obvious one, though. This depends on whether you want to be found out, too. If your character is an expert actor maybe you never have to be found out. But if you want the secret to come out, you going to have to either be honest when it does or think of a way to role play it. Maybe you never allow anyone to touch you because you're embarrassed about your size and the size of your hands and body. Maybe you mess up with your voice occasionally. Also, consider how long you've been doing this. If someone who has been play acting like this for short time is going to make more mistakes than someone who has been doing it for many years.

Does your character wear the same underclothes you do? Does your character have a lower voice? Does your character hide her ears? Her eyebrows? Is there makeup? Think about all of this. Does a character wear special shoes to appear taller? Do you? You probably going to have to work on your walk in the way you carry your shoulders and your head. As a rule, men have wider stances and take longer steps. You have to decide whether your character is better at this than you are."
ibs,fda9oad,t3_ekdjsz,1578243354.0,"I've had food poisoning so bad that it came out both ends like a rocket. Nothing like vomiting while having diarrhea repeatedly. It's the best! I guess I have no particular point here other than to say you can get really bad diarrhea during that, too...

But I'm also familiar with the anxiety of having had food poisoning once and thinking you're going to have it again."

ibs,fcjhpvs,t3_ehdutk,1577688025.0,"I try to have books and cellphone around to help me take my mind off of it. But on a more general note, fighting the stress doesn't help. You have to sort of accept that this is happening and not let it overwhelm you. If you let it make you angry, you will be angry constantly. You can't control everything.

That said, control what you can. Have extra clothing around and some wipes. Bring headphones with you so you can tune out the world. If you're at work, talk to your boss or talk to HR about needing frequent breaks. 

Since IBS is frequently at least partially a stress response, getting some assistance with your feelings of anxiety is helpful. It might be worth talking to a therapist 

Also helpful in the long term is taking up meditation, exercise, and a hobby that relaxes you. It doesn't have to be something standard like running on a treadmill.

Keep an eye on your patterns. You probably have one or more. Is your IBS worse in the morning or at night? Do you react to dairy or sugar or fat? Do small meals or big meals matter? Are you upset about something? How did you sleep last night? Keep a food log so you know what you're eating, and what effect it's having on you. Also document any major sources of stress around the same time as you have an episode."

ibs,fc7jl23,t3_eglel8,1577509480.0,"Yes, I go back and forth. Usually not for years at a time, more like weeks. It might be worth talking to your doctor if something has changed recently."
ibs,fc7hahu,t3_eggxkp,1577507415.0,I've definitely had this happen to me. I lost a job because of it once. Most good workplaces will work with you if you tell them you have a chronic illness. Consider what would be a reasonable accommodation and ask for that. Maybe reduced hours? Maybe longer breaks? Working with HR can either be extremely helpful or infuriating depending on the company. But it's worth a shot.
ibs,fc4x2af,t3_eflkpp,1577432059.0,"The main thing is that what's happening is not something to be ashamed of. If you wanted to go into detail you can say you have IBS. It's not that uncommon anymore. If you don't want to, you can simply say that you have a very sensitive stomach and leave it at that.

Shame and anxiety make IBS a million times worse. Letting go of the shame about your symptoms doesn't fix the problem but it helps. The people you want in your life will understand.

You're not obliged to convince anyone about your health. If they tell you they don't believe you, I would just stop the conversation right there.

If they're really interested, you can tell them that stress does affect it, but it's definitely not in your head. It has a measurable physical component. It's just not well understood. But that doesn't mean it's in your head."
AskHistorians,fc236p5,t3_efmaaq,1577338559.0,"I wasn't alive during this time, but I have relatives who were and lived in the Soviet Union in the 50s and 60s. They didn't go into details, but there was definitely some fear of ""western imperialism"".  It manifested in different ways in Russia than it did in the United States. 

It's also worth mentioning that in the late 40s and early 50s, Stalin's purges were causing people to turn on each other in Russia. There was a constant perception that enemies and traitors were everywhere, both within and without. Millions were murdered, imprisoned, or exiled. One awful kind of damage done to Russian Society was the inability to trust anyone because of the constant fear of secret police and informers."
