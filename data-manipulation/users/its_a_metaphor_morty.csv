AskReddit,ff8bmsk,t1_ff8axnk,1579672017.0,"All good points. I can't claim to be 100% certain of what the future holds. Unlike yourself I am probably more convinced by the data, but at the same time I'd love to be wrong.  At this juncture my main intent is just to do the best I can, because those things on their own align with general quality of life improvements. I'll no doubt do a half assed job of it but cutting down on vehicle use and flights, thinking more about the pollution side of things as well."
AskReddit,ff89sk8,t1_ff86hyq,1579670249.0,"I can respect all of those opinions, but at a simple level, there is enough real world data available to be able to average out a general pattern in temperature rise over the last 100 years, even accounting for the spreads and outliers that have come in. None of the temp data has shown a downward trend over a significant time frame that I'm aware of. As for CO2 rise, that's straight up measurable with a high level of accuracy. While correlation doesn't necessarily denote causation, as you know, the average of available data gels quite closely with the average of predictions. Yeah, it's a concern when there's a bandwagon, but this appears to be unavoidable trait of humans as a social animal. I think most of us are trying to see through the noise, but it's starting to become increasingly difficult to interpret any trends counter to those predicted. The sea level is rising, and we can measure it. CO2 is rising and we can measure it. Our carbon output is quantifiable and correlates to the atmospheric loading. So will this mean doom? Probably not in the way some think, but I don't doubt that it will mean a challenging millenia for those who come after us. In the interim I don't care about the idea of government control because this isn't something that lends itself to anything more than some basic behavioral changes, such as eliminating or reducing sale of ICE powered vehicles, more solar and windmills, and likely even nuclear and the reduction of coal. The US government already exhibits a crazy level of control over the populace."

AskReddit,ff7geyr,t1_ff7dsoi,1579648953.0,"While I agree to some extent that it is difficult for us to accurately predict the impact in a chaotic system, we do however know one key thing, namely that we know how to deal with the system we have. Not only that but every animal and plant on the planet is adapted to what is here now. If it changes in any way, there will be [and are] mass extinctions. Since we know that we are directly driving the change in climate right now, we also know we have the power to hold it as close to the status quo as we like, if we are suitably motivated. In the times of sail a ship would have a crow's nest, and the person up there warned us when we were steering towards the rocks. That's all climate scientists are doing.

Before that, even with agriculture fully understood on a fundamental level, the population was fairly predictable in growth. The modern capitalist growth era looks very much like a supercharged version of anything that came before because now populations live long enough to drive runaway growth. Before antibiotics a family could have six children and it was common to lose two or three. This makes the modern economic era an anomaly in human history and it's why we are experiencing negative outcomes.

AskReddit,ff3v4kt,t1_ff2z2r6,1579549520.0,"Let's take one example, housing. Let's limit our environment; there are 10 people on an island and there are 9 houses. The value of a house is whatever one person is prepared to part with to let person number 10 buy it. In an increasing population land and house prices climb steadily. Now let's have 10 houses and 9 people. The value of the extra house falls, because it isn't required. If the population falls, house prices will fall. The value of housing is one of the principle economic drivers in western society, and it is propped up by demand. It is arguable that shelter and food are the epicenters of all economies, regardless of any noise one wants to throw in the mix. These and transportation form the highest real-value expenditures for 99% of people, and their values are set by demand driven by population growth. ergo. If you understand economics, you will understand what a halved population will do to real estate values, hence what that will do to the largest economic grind there is for most people."

The only reason the US has done any of this is to force Iran back to the petro dollar after it switched to the Euro. It's a gang war with the US as the party shaking down the other. All else is theater, which you are happily clapping along to.

""U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to exit a 2015 nuclear deal Iran made with world powers unless it is revised. U.S. sanctions will resume unless Trump issues new “waivers” to suspend them on May 12""

That's the plot. All of it.

You are also labouring under a series of illusions; firstly that the whitehouse internally has the right to carry out an extra-judicial killing of any sort without the approval of congress; that said killing be conducted without evidence [of which none has even yet been presented]; that such killings are in accordance with international law [they aren't]; that the US is at war with Iran [it isn't].

What has happened is that as a nation the moral compass of the US is now so far out of alignment with the rest of the western world as to basically be spinning like a fan. Everything it does is good. Everyone else is evil."
worldnews,fetq33b,t1_fetd4tq,1579378244.0,"Supposition. What makes this a crime is that the US is not at war with Iran, and that he was in Iraq by invitation of the Iraqi Government, and the US State Department [he was invited there by Trump as part of a negotiation]. The propositions that he was involved in anything are not grounds for summary execution by a state actor, not least in that there is plausible deniability on the part of Iran, and that the accusations are both untested, and did not even go to congress for testing. It's a mob hit. The US is now so used to murdering its enemies this way, be they perceived or real, it doesn't realise it has become a kind of dark entity of its own. Also it's worth remembering that the reason countries [well the good ones that are left anyway], don't do this, is because it creates the equivalent of a gang war, where all methods are reasonable. If at some juncture a bomb goes off under a senior US official, and Iran claimed it, it would be of equal moral value to what the US has done. Surprisingly I don't think the Iranians would do this, as much as they have the same right that the US has given itself."
