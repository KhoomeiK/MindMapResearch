Wow. I just googled it, and holy shit, I really didn't know it was so uncommon, particularly here in the U.S. Since it happened to me as a kid, I just guess I grew up thinking like, oh, yup, dying from rabies happens."
justforsocialmedia,ffbfy3d,t1_ffbb3iy,1579763565.0,"Yup. He woke up and there was a bat in his room, he didn't know it had even touched him. 

But if you happen to be emphasizing bat rabies in reference to Michael Scott's Dunder Mifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer Memorial Celebrity Rabies Awareness Pro-Am Fun Run Race For The Cure then... yeah... I've guiltily made that connection before as well."

It’s not a dotted notebook, or grid or anything. Just a regular ol ljned journal. But the quality of paper is my favorite of any journal I’ve had before"
Journaling,fefq6no,t1_fefpsf6,1579062075.0,"I’m not sure. Despite being subbed to r/fountainpens I do not have one. If I had to guess, a fountain pen might take a few seconds to dry on this type of paper. I don’t know if that means anything to you or if I’m even right lol. Sorry!"

Journaling,feeahj8,t3_eopw3x,1579029748.0,These are Peter pauper press journals. Of which I am a hugeee sucker for. The paper quality is so smooth and trimmed with gold! I can’t wait to have a bookshelf filled with these :)

Conservative,fe7deuc,t1_fe79v6w,1578913044.0,"It’s not fictional math, it’s *factual* math. Those are real numbers. 

I’m not being negative at all. I’m a huge optimist by nature. My optimism is why I believe that we will find a solution - and logic is why I believe that socializing healthcare is not the solution. I’m not willing to just “see what happens,” because I can already see what happens. Based on facts.

You’re saying we need a country that works for the people. When a government “working for me” comes at the price of howeverthefuckmuchthegovernmentdecides out of mine and yours, then the reality is that it would be the people who are working for the country."
Conservative,fe72xdg,t1_fe6rj23,1578909254.0,"It sounds nice, but it is not sustainable. 

In 2015, heath expenditures in the U.S were on average nearly $10k per person, with a total of $3.2 trillion. In the same year, the IRS raked in $3.3 trillion in taxes.

To cover the expense of healthcare alone with taxes would be almost all of the taxes we pay now. Either our taxes would go insanely high, or our healthcare quality would suffer. Or likely both. 

The answer is not to take money from what is spent on military. Do you find it wise to quit the funding of a military whose country has spent, like you pointed out, 90% of its history at war? 

A healthy, smart society *would* reduce government handouts, but the problems of society are not to be solved by the government. A healthy, smart society starts at home, and in our smaller communities, and that’s what we should be focused on."
