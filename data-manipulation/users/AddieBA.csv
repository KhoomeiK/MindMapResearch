bulletjournal,feurk88,t1_fes6j7j,1579389290.0,I was conflicted for a while but went for it anyway. I bought a pregnancy journal before I got pregnant and ended up not liking the author after some stuff they did online. And thank you!
bulletjournal,ferfez1,t1_feqq7vo,1579353279.0,"Thanks for replying. I'm still early in the first trimester but I'm writing out what happening every week, it's how I learn. Then I'm adding who we've told, how we're feeling etc. I'd like it to end up tracking growth and sleeping as well once they're here. I hope the rest of your pregnancy goes smoothly!"
bulletjournal,fepni75,t3_eq68kh,1579325259.0,Ooh I just started my own! Congratulations! What are you tracking in yours if you don't mind me asking?

I definitely got the control window which I haven't had in some other tests so I think I'll leave that brand alone from now on."

Midwives,fdfnj2k,t3_el4r9z,1578365802.0,"As a nurse you have to be vaccinated for Hep B,C, MMR, pertussis (from memory). I was also immunised for tuberculosis during my training but I can't remember if it's mandatory. Most universities should have within their application packages what vaccinations you need. Good luck"
CrappyDesign,fdepcix,t3_ekwmaf,1578343817.0,Ah I see we bought the same laptop case
