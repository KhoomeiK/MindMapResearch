Hyperhidrosis,fg1f42h,t1_fg16mmk,1580425974.0,"I never tried AHC, because of all the negative effects, primarily cancer.

I'm from up north :P"
todayilearned,fg1avxa,t1_fg19orq,1580423905.0,"Thanks for your kind words.

I started by watching eye contact videos on YouTube xD

I don't have trouble looking at and observing people who are talking, but when I talk myself, my eyes move around everywhere, because it helps me think (?)

Another annoying aspect of amblyopia: you don't know whether that cute guy/girl looks at you because of your weird eyes or because they find you attractive."
todayilearned,fg16trc,t1_fg15akt,1580421878.0,"When I was a child, the doctors said that i should wait until my body has fully developed and then do the surgery. It was painful, because i got operated on both eyes, even the good one, because the degree of the squint was so high. But it was well worth it in regards to my confidence to look other people in the eye and to BE looked at by other people. Before the surgery, when people looked at me, I always thought people think of me as a weirdo because of my eye, so I never developed any real confidence."
todayilearned,fg14lbz,t1_fg11kzr,1580420632.0,"Wait the muscle surgeries cured your Amblyopia?
I've had one and it did not improve the vision, just the cosmetics of my eyes.

After reading the title I immediately wanted to play tetris, but I guess I don't have the correct setup with the blue and red pieces and the glasses"
Hyperhidrosis,fg13xze,t3_ewauci,1580420274.0,"Can relate, I have had HH since kindergarten. I am 24 now and I feel like it has determined my life in social aspects so much that I would be in a totally different place in life now, if I didn't have this terrible diseases, whose dramatic effects no one understands but those, who suffer from it. 

I know the feeling of being trapped. 
Can't concentrate on anything else. 
Hands and feet are damp. Clothes or bed sheets are wet. But you don't want to move out, because you won't stop sweating anyways. 
Nowhere to go. 
Nothing to do against it.
Trapped in your own body. 

I get medical weed from my insurance in Germany and it helps. Glad you make the same positive experiences with weed. If you don't wanna get too baked, try CBD strains or oil.

Antihydral helps me. Should be available online. If not, I can buy it here locally in Germany and send it to you :)

Also exercise and breathing helps me for when my hands are damp and not ""actively"" sweating. Even though that's the least thing one wants to do, when sweating. But think about it: sweat is heat, heat is energy, that energy is inside and by sweating, the body wants to get that energy out. 
So why don't you get the energy out yourself by exercising the body? 

Unscientific way to look at it, but I think it holds some truth to it. 

Sweat is cooling down the body. 
There is too much heat inside. 
What is causing that heat?
Anxiety, stress? About what?"
Hyperhidrosis,ffc1o2o,t1_ffbvx2q,1579789283.0,Makes me wonder about the 90% of the world population that doesn't have HH and that doesn't have depression xD

I hope it's ok if I use this as my wallpaper hehe"
selfimprovement,fdvwyxx,t3_en400o,1578752635.0,"totally agree.

wise way to look at the world"
MrRobot,fdvwv6v,t3_en62wz,1578752596.0,"ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?!?!?!

DONT MAKE ME LAUGH!"
Hyperhidrosis,fdlcioe,t3_elwj2f,1578521099.0,"can totally relate.
I'm just 24 y.o., but the last two years have been hell for me with HH and selective mutism.

I started taking medical cannabis and it has changed my life for the better, drastically so.

I hope you don't get too many side effects with your anti depressants and that you can get the chance to experience the world in a new way of perception and thinking."
MrRobot,fdjrrgy,t3_elqxdn,1578485072.0,"I will rehearse your pitch every day on front of the mirror until I can deliver it with such conviction that it will make everyone who I come across, even the cashier at the supermarket, a true believer."
Meditation,fcz7lkt,t3_ejfbhm,1578095290.0,"And it makes sense!

Meditation is listening to your mind.

listening to your mind is only fully possible, if you do not perceive any external stimuli.

We instinctively close our eyes when meditating or when we need to concentrate.
so why not ""close"" your ears?

the only thing we need is to breathe, because otherwise we die."
selectivemutism,fcz10sp,t3_ejhypj,1578091517.0,Great work and nicely presented!
Hyperhidrosis,fcsvrte,t3_eip7gp,1577926359.0,"thanks for sharing.

switching polarity works for my iontophoresis treatment, but it is kind of inconsistent.

I will try without changing it."
