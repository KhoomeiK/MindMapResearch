It began on any ordinary Monday in the summer of 08, when I was just 6 years old at the time. I was running around at this daycare camp, there were trampolines, a foam pit, and then the gymnastics area. Really nice place, kinda worn down a little, but nonetheless, it felt safe. I saw a kid, let's call him Toby, and I do remember his name, just not his last, sadly. So Toby decided to swing kids around by having them hold onto his shirt and he would spin in a circle, round and round he would go. Now, being this hyperactive kid due to my parents fucking me up at birth (I was born addicted to Methadone, heroin, booze, etc) and them not being the best parents they were, I didnt really get a good idea of what I should be doing, and of course I was also 6. So, at the time, I thought it would be an excellent idea to do this because it looked like alot of fun. I asked Toby if I could have a go, and he said sure. I remember it like it was a sunny day yesterday, blue shorts, a white t-shirt, blonde hair. He started spinning, round and round, then I felt it, my hands started to slip due to them becoming sweaty. I yelled stop, over and over, and he never did. My grip loosened with each spin, and I was scared for my life. I believe he thought I would go to the side of the room (giant room, had everything in it) and not towards the balance beams, but that's where he was sadly mistaken. My hands slipped, and what it felt like minutes, but took only seconds, I flew across the room, and hit the right side of my head on it, smack down on the end of it. I cried forever, but finally got better, and I know I definitely got a concussion, but the real trouble started on Wednesday, two days after the incident. We were about to go swimming, and I had a killer headache,  so I asked if I could go lay upstairs on the couch, and they said sure. I go upstairs, barely making it there, and i started to throw up blood, and then it went dark. The next thing I know is that I was in a hospital bed, not knowing what was happening. I was driven from that place after they found me, passed out on the couch, to the newest hospital, but that hospital was to new at the time, so I was life flighted from this hospital to OHSU, one of the best hospitals there is, and I was put into a medically induced coma for about a week or two. I had a hematoma, or a bruise on the brain. I'm lucky to have lived"
