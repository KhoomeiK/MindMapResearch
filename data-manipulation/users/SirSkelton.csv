Breadit,fgxs3qk,t1_fgw1lfv,1581176100.0,"For both I used the recipe below for the dough. After letting it sit 18 hours I punched out the dough, stirred in the add ins, and let rest for half an hour. I diced 4 jalapeños to mix in, and cut one into rings to put on top. I didn’t really measure the cheese, just put in how much seemed right. 
  
Also, I used the minimum cook times on the recipe (35 covered then 10 uncovered). I tried it once before this doing 37 and 12 and the bottoms came out burnt. Not sure if my oven was running hot, or if the recipe just suggests too high of times.
