The fact that he was able to get reinstated multiple times after so many drug abuse and worse, animal abuse, charges and complaints is horrifying. It also shows a massive blind spot in the legal system, as under any good system he would have been jailed. From what I remember he only got 100 days in prison for his worst punishment, which is just sad. He shouldn't even be able to step foot in a practice, not to manage or to practice, yet he is still able to. All of the animals he has abused and even killed deserve more justice.

Also as bad as it sounds, I had to hold back a giggle when I saw he was fined for attempting to spay a male cat. How do you manage to get that far without realizing, the closest we have come would be discovering a cat is a different sex than the owners thought and having to let them know that there will be a change of plans.

AskReddit,ffu67ug,t1_fftn71m,1580235350.0,"I know this feeling so well. On September 17th, a Tuesday, one of my friends from college committed suicide. I'd only known him for a year, but my whole group of friends on my floor with him managed to forge a special kind of bond. 

I didn't hear about it until the Friday after, and at first I thought it was some bad joke. A friend shared details about his memorial, but I was sitting there thinking it couldn't possibly be true, he was typically pretty happy and while he had times when he was clearly depressed, the last thing I saw of him was a video of him doing a simple knife trick, pulling the knife from his boot, flipping it, then saying 'bootknife.' It was kinda funny, and I still have the short clip. He seemed happy, if a bit drunk. The vid was from the Saturday or Sunday before. 

On Tuesday he blew his brains out. His memorial was on Sunday. I tried to go to class on Monday, but it didn't really work, I started trying to explain to my first professor why I didn't do the reading for class and I couldn't even finish without breaking down in tears. He told me to just go to counseling, don't worry about class. I went to one class on Tuesday, failed the test I had that day (63). I don't think I went to class much on Wednesday. Finally got back into it around Thursday, but I couldn't walk back to my dorm without crying (walking alone in silence does that), so I ended up in the habit of taking the bus. The whole experience really messed me up for the semester, ended up dropping my writing class and failing my chemistry (coincidentally the one I failed that test in, though that was just one factor). I've finally started to recover completely, though it took a long time to get here and I'm still grieving some. The most helpful thing for me was just telling people about it and writing about it here on Reddit.

 I cried a bit the other day for him, so I guess that's my answer to the question. I'm crying right now for him, so there's another answer. I guess if anything good came out of this whole experience, it would be that I learned how to properly grieve. I couldn't really grieve before, but now I was even able to grieve over one of our porch cats that we had to put down (FIV).

RIP Aden, you are still missed. Hope you are finally happy now that you aren't in this broken world."

Well let's see, how to people who are underprivileged usually get this? Scholarships. If you have the skill academically then you can do it. For God's sake, I agree it is more difficult, this is a proven fact, but you seem to be under the incredibly racist/classist assumption that it is literally impossible for people who are underprivileged to become successful. I am stateing the fact that underprivileged people are able to make it on skill, and you are denying this because apparently they just aren't good enough for it. Would it be racist and classist to say that a poor black person can never succeed in life because they are poor and black? That is basically what you are saying. You disgust me.

SelfAwarewolves,ffs2hz3,t1_ffs1myj,1580171523.0,"While there is certainly a case to be made for privilege increasing chances of improving skill, you are discounting the underprivileged when you say that they can never learn it. It is possible for someone to simply be naturally better at something, and no amount of privilege can make up for that. Your argument falls apart when you realize that it is possible for the underprivileged to make it into a field on skill alone. While it is certainly harder for the underprivileged, that is not your argument. Your argument is that skill doesn't play any part, which you somehow manage to contradict in the very next sentence."
