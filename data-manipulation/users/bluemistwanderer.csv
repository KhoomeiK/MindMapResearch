The government is the ""private owner"" in this case and sees every infrastructure spend as an investment. It takes into account the perceived growth that an area will generate and subsequently the tax income it will take. If the road is funded by a private firm, the government pays the toll for you. Such as the M25 and A1/M1 link road - they are both wholly privately owned. 

>you're not expected to pay to get on a road. 

Road tax, insurance, and insurance premium tax, MOT, the tax to buy the car in the first place. 

>If you stand by this idea of roads being capitalism then you're going to have to explain to me why socialist nations wouldn't have roads, please.

I was labouring the point of originally a road existed for capitalist purposes, other nations have seen that it might be a good idea to move people and goods from one city to another, again to increase tax and revenues that can go into their power projects like huge armies, nuclear weapons etc.. Socialist states like China are socialist all the way up to the top table then it appears to become dramatically capitalist."

No they aren't, they are there to develop areas to create more wealth and tax revenue.

The moment it becomes not profitable to make roads the government will focus on other transport methods."
