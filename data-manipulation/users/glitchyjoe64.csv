SkincareAddiction,fgjb2iz,t1_fgiurqi,1580840443.0,"I would consider eating large amounts of rare high-quality steaks/beef in general for the iron and supplementing 1000mg a day of vitamin c with any standard amount of copper. Research into oxalates and be sure to cook things in lard/fat/butter/ghee as opposed to oxidised oils. If you cannot stomach beef, try fish or eggs in good amounts.

Don't shower too often as it dries the skin out. Also allow your eyes to get plenty of sunlight. Consider eye warming. (looking at the sun with your eyes closed) it's safe, I do it. It will help bring colour to your eyes.

Try also eating plenty of coconut oil and avocado, low sugar, high water foods. Reduce straight water intake if you drink a gallon a day. Does the same to your insides as outside. Dries it out.

And then after all this advice, I MAYBE would recommend some moisturizers liquids for your eyes. But remember that circles can also just be genetic. Be sure you're absorbing all your nutrients, blood tests do not indicate nutrient within the body being used."
