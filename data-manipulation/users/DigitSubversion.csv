The player can have his own full blown character and the Extras are all just ""oh, this guy is good at this so I'll give him this stat, and I'll give him average stats for the rest of it, maybe an edge (feat)"".

They die more quickly than characters (1 wound and they're down, instead of player characters with 3 wounds and then the 4th down), but you can handle them so easily that you can basically have a small army of extras with you.

I do recommend the latest version of Savage Worlds for this though (Adventure Edition). It's more streamlined and players more smoothly."
DnD,ffqmv68,t3_eumgtb,1580138792.0,"Hmmm, I see people being inspired by Poirot :D

I have a Inquisitive Rogue Gnome called Heckler Parrot. Think of Keeping Up Appearances with Bucket being phonetically changed to bouquet.

(His real name is Farmin Fizzlerock though. Think Fjord's stage accent of Critical Role)"
ageofsigmar,ffhtdik,t1_ffhta66,1579952917.0,Hah! My apologies then! I sometimes can't read the situation properly in text.
patientgamers,ffhtbks,t3_etc1bk,1579952840.0,I remember when I played Deer Hunter 2004. I loved it back then! It was really relaxing! I should try this one out maybe.
ageofsigmar,ffhszv4,t3_etaefh,1579952356.0,"[Made a half attempt of making this not seizure inducing](https://imgur.com/a/0QZX9y5), by just taking the time to experiment how you can set it next to each other without knowledge. My apologies if this comment sounds a bit snarky, but the way OP reacts to suggestions made me react this way."
DnD,ffhs9rw,t1_ffh0yzb,1579951270.0,40 inch 1080p? Or does resolution not matter?
patientgamers,ff8tx79,t1_ff80x0i,1579695945.0,"Same here. I also, after my free days were over, crashed off my horse. Like hard stop. I need to get back on it, but it has been some while now!"
dndnext,ff5nwk7,t3_erm7qm,1579602405.0,So how do Sorcerers know their powers? Their powers are innate. Most powers contain a verbal and or a somatic component to it. How do they discover these powers if magic can't be sensed?
books,ff33t5r,t1_ff33b5z,1579532964.0,Bright is that the elves are snobs and rich while the orcs are all living in slums mostly. Not sure about oppression.
books,ff2wmqa,t1_ff2ux8w,1579526915.0,"Hurting your eyes, are you comparing a screen similar to smartphones to an e-reader?

Because e-ink basically projects it once and it reads way more like a book.

Though, I do prefer physical books, I really love it!"
dndnext,ff2q8lv,t1_ff2mppw,1579519039.0,"Or someone can make a joke out of a common misspelling? There's so situation for the need of a chill pill.

I really love the concept!"
patientgamers,feugtlf,t1_fes5g79,1579386438.0,"Yeah, I've got great memories with this game! Especially when we all tried to do it non-lethally!"
patientgamers,fes53yx,t1_fepvg83,1579361465.0,"Back when I was sleeping over at my uncles place with my nephew and niece, because my mother was dying, this game I've been playing a lot! Talked a lot about it with all three of them too!

(the reason for sleeping over was my father was moving places and I would wouldn't be able to help him - for context)"
patientgamers,fes4iaw,t1_fepazkd,1579361346.0,Relaxing and nerve wrecking at the same time? I only once had that same experience. It's a great vibe! Definitely am interested in trying it now. The game by the way is Enter the Gungeon.
