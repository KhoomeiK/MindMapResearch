OldSchoolCool,ffamlbp,t1_ffa4v4g,1579739482.0,"Some kids had it since being a baby, so it was your entire life in one braid."
Games,ff43z7g,t1_ff315fw,1579555029.0,Have you ever played MUDs or other text based games? Since they are completely text based if you have a good reader I would imagine they would be quite playable?
Games,fewhseu,t1_few49lw,1579410819.0,"Plus, the goal of a BR is getting out alive... As the last one standing. So, wtf?"
gifs,feuw36q,t1_fetr70s,1579390488.0,You got something against the goosies?
Games,fepocx2,t1_fep0s2n,1579325987.0,I've been waiting on that day to come with superhero movies for like... A decade now? They just keep coming...
BasicIncome,feplhih,t1_fepiwvf,1579323629.0,"That's assuming it's taxed/deemed income in the current sense. Or assuming we just ignore taxes, regulations, minimum wage and everything else when implementing a UBI."
BasicIncome,fepl6ge,t1_fepiioh,1579323398.0,And you save money doing away with the work hours investigating and supplying that service on the govt side as well.
ofcoursethatsathing,felwnxx,t1_felp5fr,1579232806.0,Or the massive gap between sets of prints unless you're babystepping.
Futurology,fehl6g3,t1_fehj87c,1579118784.0,"Not sure if this is what he is talking about, but I've seen it plenty in the us as well as canada. But it's basically a train but runs on wheels. Closed track, no other traffic, sliding doors, looks like a train until you check the undercarriage. Seen it a lot in airports, and I think it was... Montreal that their underground was like this.

Not the same, but Boston also runs one line that about half of it is dedicated tunnel for the bus, switches to electric."
Games,feg0veh,t1_fefhdtk,1579072160.0,"Sony and the others are aware of that. It's not great, but Sony has that shareplay feature. It only lasts an hour until you need to restart it. Obviously it's subpar, but shows an awareness that people appreciate that about physical copies and may improve over time."
syriancivilwar,fedm48r,t1_fedfc0l,1579014893.0,"Yes, I get that. Where are the numbers coming from?"
syriancivilwar,fedatqc,t1_fecv529,1579006015.0,"What about the other nine? And can we get an actual link and not the cookies consent link? I just spend time digging around their site and haven't found those numbers. And one article mentions the non-binding part.

syriancivilwar,fecrt93,t1_fecn6sq,1578982189.0,"Do we actually have the numbers from the vote? I haven't seen it in any of the english news articles. And cannot find on the Iraqi Parliamentary website. I have also heard there were not enough present for quorum.

Also, the PM resigned. So not really sure what powers remain in regards to the first point."
Games,fe6nchu,t1_fe6juyv,1578896890.0,"I dunno about that... Seems to have become industry standard for publishers to have studios help one another. And while it might not happen often with in-house engines, you have a lot of places sharing knowledge and tools surrounding the biggies like unreal and unity. Certainly wasn't the case in the 90s and earlier. But even in the 2000s you had the start of what we see today with Source (and earlier versions of unreal).

Look at the number of support studios for rdr2, and I know ea, Sony and Microsoft all do the same. And sledgehammer started as a support studio for cod. Crytec early on for starcitizen. I'm sure loads more examples if I started googling."
cats,fcv3a5z,t1_fcv06uq,1577993756.0,"I agree. I guess I just question what exists, because it doesn't allow for everyone's beliefs. A certain group of peoples beliefs have been made law. There are other factors as some have pointed out, I still need to check out that podcast. But I have a feeling those are a result of what I said before and not truly separate factors that developed independently. And unfortunately, that restricts people's ability to go out how they see fit if they would have even been able to make an informed decision. That being another sticking point due to things like dementia."
cats,fctguj4,t1_fcterhz,1577942838.0,"Cool, I'll check that out."
cats,fctdbhr,t1_fcsyvh1,1577939666.0,"General question, not aimed at you but the topic. I agree as well, and it seems common with how we deal with end of life for pets but not humans. Why? It seems we have developed laws and social norms around religious doctrine regarding how someones life can end. But with all the shared experience of losing loved ones, and how it can often be a slow, painful process for the individual... I dunno, seems wrong."
movies,fcnoys2,t1_fcnjid4,1577815674.0,"Sure. I'm mostly curious to see what it looks like. I was thinking examples more like video stuff, like youtube, movies, ads I dunno. Things I could check out, I'm not going to research and go to some event and people watch till I find the crazy lol."
movies,fcni47n,t1_fcmzpbf,1577812172.0,I've mostly lived on the east coast. So maybe less of a presence or campaign for me to notice?

movies,fckpr38,t1_fck70zx,1577730540.0,"Does Scientology make media for the public? Afaik I've never seen anything...

Or do they have some huge media operation producing content of some sort for believers?"
SandersForPresident,fc36vsd,t1_fc2qmlk,1577382894.0,"I guess... I mean, there are still people that go out and grab roadkill, or go birdwatching, or find other critters, etc. We may not be of interest to the government or galactic Corp or whatever. But some scientist or a weirdo who likes to observe or prank some less intelligent species (like the people that mess with cats etc). Seems pretty likely given we're 7 billion on a single planet and we have wildly different interests and activities."
