That's me being kind. Honestly if he doesnt care about your pleasure then he can fuck off. Seems to me he's being selfish. if he cant understand, try talking but if he does and still doesnt give you what you want, which sounds to me like passion and sincerity, then he just isnt worth it. I dont know your situation obviously but he has no respect. 

Your husband should want what's best for YOU as well as himself. If he continues, you be a fucking badass okay? Becuase you deserve pleasure and love! Everyone does! 

Best wishes and good luck!

Anxiety,fdc4q5w,t3_ekd67q,1578267069.0,"Omg I feel exactly the same way. It's just the feeling that you'd be lying there dwelling on life with no escape ever! And when I go to bed, it's dark, and I hear nothing, so I HAVE A SOLUTION! I know this sounds lame, but I got a night light. And I got a radio so that it would play while I'm trying to fall asleep. So that way I'm distracted and I daydream abt other stuff. Yeet
Edit: also telling myself that ""everyone dies"" and exhaling really calms me down :)"
