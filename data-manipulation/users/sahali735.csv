germanshepherds,ffdksmu,t1_ffdjq01,1579822980.0,"You are welcome. Hi-test fishing line takes the place of a leash. You remove the leash and the dog thinks he's off-leash, then when he gets almost to end of the line you give the command, "" Doggy, COME"" and if he chooses not to, he gets a rude awakening and you can just reel him in. Literally. It doesn't usually take too many sessions with the fishing line \[one or two\] to fix that problem. Dog has to know there are consequences and that no matter what, YOU are in charge and have control over whatever situation. Off you go then!  :)  WOOF!"
germanshepherds,ffdj4of,t3_et0k57,1579821963.0,"Back to basics you go! You cannot give a command unless and until your dog is SOLID, and I do mean solid. Yours is a bit young to be that solid. Also, you cannot give a command unless you are able to reinforce it, which, is not possible for a recall unless the dog is on leash. So now you have taught your dog he doesn't have to listen because you are unable to reinforce the command. He can move from leash to long lead to hi-test fishing line. I'm not sure how much training you've done with your dog, but the more, the better. Remember the 3 Ps......patience, praise and persistence.  Best of luck.  :)  WOOF!"
