fatlogic,ffda42m,t1_ffciarx,1579816423.0,"No, never had anything to do with HAES. Though one of my friends (who is obese herself) loves to talk about my weight loss behind my back and say stuff like, ""I find it so sad that women feel the need to shrink themselves like that."" I don't think she's into HAES exactly, but she is FULL to the brim with fatlogic. 

I think it has more to do with the country I live in. I live in the Middle East and 75 percent of the population of the country I'm in right now is either overweight or obese. I think people here have just forgotten what a normal, fit body looks like (not that mine is very fit yet - but it IS very normal). Most of my friends are also overweight or obese, and do not seem to intend to do anything about that any time soon. 

Also, food is such a big thing here. It's one of the only ways to socialise, and everything is always, always centred around it. And no one likes that one person who refuses to indulge at every social gathering like everyone else. It's kinda like that stupid AF Virgie video where she goes on and on about someone who refuses to have cake or asks for  a smaller size at a party. That's how most people here feel about me. That I'm just a party pooper and out to ruin their fun.

Thank you for trying to validate my feelings, though. It felt really nice to read that."

fatlogic,ff8q9t3,t1_ff7j12f,1579691539.0,"Thank you so much, yak on the internet! I really appreciate your kind words.

I too enjoy the way I get looked at now. Up until a BMI of 26, I still managed to generate a lot of interest in people around me (I carry my weight quite well until that point). But beyond that point, it was as if I slowly starting to disappear and melt into the background every time I walked into a room. It wasn't a great feeling. 

Hope you're proud of yourself too, and enjoying your hard work. Yay us. :D"

fatlogic,ff6q0la,t1_ff6necv,1579632477.0,"Oh, fuck that ""Are you on Keto?"" noise! That's what I hear EVERY SINGLE TIME I see someone whom I haven't seen in a while. Not that I have anything against keto, but I personally am not on it. There ARE other ways to lose weight, but people don't seem to want to hear anything about it. Even though they asked. 

My goal BMI is 19.8. I am personally proud of you for accomplishing what I want to accomplish, if that helps in any way."
fatlogic,ff6pmqh,t1_ff6lpl2,1579632245.0,"It is, it is so fucking exhausting! I think the insecurity is coming from the fact that almost all of my close friends have gained a lot of weight over the past two years - and I was in the same boat, until I suddenly wasn't.

Thank you so much, though! I am extremely proud of myself. I literally did a little jig after getting off the weighing scale today :D"
fatlogic,ff6ex92,t3_ervuu1,1579625710.0,"Rant: I am so fucking sick and tired of my friends bringing me down for losing weight. I've been whining about it on Reddit for a week now, but every fresh wave of negativity over my weight loss brings on another wave of anger in me. 

I was told by a friend that I'm 'wasting away'. I was told by another that I don't have tits anymore (my bra size is 34DD, down from 38E). People look into my plate and make loud comments about what I'm eating (""You're eating CARBS? I thought you were on a diet!""). People judge me if I order a salad (""But you're already so skinny, live a little!""). People judge me if I eat birthday cake (""You're eating EVEN MORE CARBS?! Wow!""). People constantly pester me to ask me what I did to lose weight, and when I tell them, they look at me funny, as if they feel sorry for me, and then they say something like, ""Oh, but don't you get....bored of that stuff?"" 

No, no I fucking don't, because I'm a fucking grown up who can enjoy her vegetables and salads just as much as fucking cake. 

I really don't want anyone's approval or appreciation. I got that by posting a progress picture online in a group of people who have the same goals that I do. That's literally enough for me. But I would really rather like to be left alone about my weight IRL. I'm so done with people who are bigger and much unhealthier than I am giving me advice. They were the same ones who said NOTHING when I was at a BMI of almost 29, which put me at high risk of T2 diabetes and heart disease because of my ethnicity.

Rave: I am now at a BMI 22.7! Officially out of the danger-zone, BMI-wise, for my height and ethnicity. I'm so fucking proud of myself!"
fatlogic,ff64toj,t1_ff5vkc5,1579619148.0,Thank you!
fatlogic,ff5tbz8,t1_ff5t1d9,1579609474.0,"Yes, exactly. Although I do find My 600lbs Life to be severely depressing at times. I just watched Lacey's story yesterday and the fact that it took her ages to get off the ground after a simple fall made me almost cry for her. 

Secret Eaters is all in good fun while getting the job done. Wish they kept doing it, there arent enough episodes of it!"
fatlogic,ff5s9ca,t1_ff5gm3w,1579608292.0,"This is one of the reasons I love the show Secret Eaters so much. They had two sisters on an episode once, and the minute I saw them I thought, 'But they aren't even fat.' And they were 'only' overweight, I think. But Secret Eaters made it a point that it's not just morbidly obese people who are in danger and need help, and nipped those two young women from getting to morbid obesity status in the bud."
fatlogic,ff5rvwo,t1_ff5rpf1,1579607861.0,"Yep, it does, and yes we can. I'm South Asian and I'm at a greater risk of heart disease and diabetes at a BMI greater than 23. 

So it's just as well that I just hit a BMI of 22.7 just today *runs around the room screaming with excitement*

Edited to add: I am so excited that I wrote 'just' thrice in that last sentence. My apologies."
progresspics,ff3e2w5,t1_ff3do4w,1579539222.0,Sometimes I really want to turn around and say something nasty. But I'm mostly that kind of a person who thinks of a comeback 12 hours later and can be found kicking herself for not thinking of it before.
fatlogic,ff319xz,t1_ff3176v,1579531007.0,Same! Have a good day. :)
fatlogic,ff311ji,t1_ff30bab,1579530821.0,"It's totally okay. And I did not mean to come off as the holier-than-thou, health-food maniac either, so I also apologise if I did. 

I eat real ice cream sometimes. And cake. And burgers and fries. But I also just really think it helps to know how to make lower calorie, nutrient-dense versions of food that you crave. Helped me lose about 35 pounds in 6 months, and I don't feel deprived at all. If anything, I feel like I'm eating better, more delicious food than I used to. Also, this kind of stuff really helps in the beginning of a weight loss journey, keeps the cravings at bay without compromising progress. 

To each their own, because at the end of the day it's all CICO. But for someone who really freaking loves food AND also wants their hair and skin to stay in the best shape possible while losing weight, this is a great way to do it."
progresspics,ff2zzwg,t1_fen6w66,1579529962.0,">Right now you’re at a good place, but it’s not quite head turning “wow” per say. You’re simply at a healthy point.

See, here's where the problem comes in. The majority of the population in the city I live in is overweight or obese. Hence, to the majority of the population, I AM at the head-turning ""wow"" state already. Hence the comments from friends treating me as if I'm wasting away (oh wait, a friend of mine ACTUALLY said yesterday that I'm wasting away. That was fun. Anyway). 

However, I actually agree with everything you wrote. I think there's room for improvement. Will I be considered ""too skinny"" and possibly unattractive by people around me when I get to my GW? Possibly. But I really don't care. I know what I'm doing and I'll continue doing it. 

Thanks so much for the encouragement, btw! I really appreciate it. :D"
fatlogic,ff2z7js,t1_ff2yz99,1579529300.0,"It really doesn't, though. There's two bananas, a glug of milk, a tbsp or two of cacao powder and a squeeze of honey which gives up about four to five servings. You COULD add avocado and yes, that would increase the calorie count, but how much avocado can you possibly add? I normally add about a quarter. 

You need to chill out, btw."
fatlogic,ff2yr42,t1_ff2unvr,1579528895.0,I think the same about Monica from Friends!
fatlogic,ff2yntz,t3_er9ovn,1579528814.0,"Not 100 percent related to the discussion, but it really helps to know how to make delicious, healthy substitutes for foods that you crave at home. Someone should tell an FA that.

I make my own 'ice cream' at home by blending frozen bananas, milk, honey and cacao powder. You could add avocado to make it even thicker and creamier. Top it off with nuts or homemade granola. It's like soft-serve ice cream, only without the guilt, and takes less than five minutes to make."
solotravel,ff2ib4z,t3_er6cdl,1579507372.0,"This is my worst nightmare come to life.

My mom's house had bed bugs the last time I was there for an extended trip. The minute I got home, I double wrapped all my luggage (and I had A LOT of it, because extended trip) in clear plastic bags, and left it in my bathtub. I also immediately put all the clothes I wore to the airport straight in the washer/dryer on a high heat cycle. 

I then tackled all my luggage piece by piece, washing anything that could be washed, and freezing anything that couldn't. I also ended up storing a lot of stuff like books and my actual luggage bags in giant plastic bags for months. I honestly did not open them for at least 8 months. Overkill, but it clearly worked because my house is currently NOT infested with bed bugs."
