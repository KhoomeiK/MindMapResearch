With the encouragement of some friends, I decided I was going to make a move and ask him out. As we were walking towards the senior parking lot, I jogged up behind and tapped him on the shoulder and asked if I could talk to him for a second. He said “sure” and sent his friends on their way. When he turned back around, I sat there like a deer in the head lights turning bright red and nearly having a stroke. He said “are you okay?” And that’s when I blurted our “DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE MOVIES WITH ME?!”, then very next second, before he could answer I turn on my heel and walk away as fast as I could to my car.  I never got my answer. I wouldn’t make eye contact with him from then on. I found out a year or so later, he had a crush on me too. Oops, oh well.
