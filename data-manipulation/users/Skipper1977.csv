Dentistry,ff7ox0x,t3_es280r,1579654783.0,"I had a cracked left bottom molar about a year and a half ago.  In the middle of the night, I woke up because of the pain.  I had to take a lot of pain medication as my dentist appointment was a couple days away.  
I ended up with a root canal and a crown.  It scared me that I could have lost the tooth as my dentist couldn't really tell if it could be saved or not.

My anxiety over my dental health (I have bad anxiety to begin with) has increased a ton because of this experience.  Every little thing about my teeth gets me worked up as I am anticipating having that same experience with my other teeth.

I have increased my dental routine as a result.  I used to have sweets all the time however will now only do it when I am able to brush my teeth within a short period of time.  I also added xylitol gum after eating.  

It would be good if you can share what works for you as I am in the same boat as you."

I started to feel the effects in the New Year due to my over indulgence of protein and sugar however I took medications (Allopurinol) which caused the pain to go away.  

I have a pretty healthy diet and exercise regularly however I need to be careful to not overindulge too much otherwise I'm at risk for another gout attack.

I think one day of overindulgence is fine however a two or three days in a row which is what happened to me during the holidays caused me to have a gout attack."

Dentistry,fdckmyf,t3_ekmxza,1578277257.0,"I use a manual one with not just soft bristles, but the ultra soft ones.  It's better for the gums.  Brushing hard will cause gum recession (you cannot regrow gums).  I found this out the hard way.  I used to brush really hard in one part of my mouth.  I have recession there now however not so much where it requires any action.  

All the people I've talked to and some in the dental profession recommend the electric toothbrushes as it does a thorough cleaning.  Make sure if you do end using one that you don't use it like a manual where you  move it up and down.  Just place it on the teeth and let it do the work.  This will ensure you are not brushing hard on your teeth and gums."

selfimprovement,fdbgfo5,t1_fdb4jnu,1578257139.0,"180 pounds (12.85 stone) was not healthy for myself however not so much for me to make changes.  When I saw what my true weight was actually over 200 pounds (14.28 stone), it was a wake up call/emergency sirens/realization that I needed to make changes and live a more healthy lifestyle.  

For the new year, I decided to start to be more grateful with what I have in my life.  I started a ""gratitude/happy box"" which was just a small box that was lying around.  I bought some very cheap note pads of about 350 sheets.  Each evening I write down what made me happy that day.  It can be small like eating a great dessert, or a feeling (felt excited when I saw my crush at the gym today).  I will put this interaction that I had with you today as one of those things that made me happy.  I'll put ""conversed with someone from the UK today"" and learned they measure weight in ""stone"" there."
selfimprovement,fdb3rpm,t3_ekbj2l,1578253389.0,"I was 23 at the time.  I was always around 180 pounds throughout my university days.  Shortly after graduating, about 10 months into my job, my co-workers started to weight each other (we had one of those Dr scales in our lunch room).  I said I didn't have to weigh myself as I've always been 180.

I got on the scale.  My co-worker put the weight at 180 however I wasn't that weight.  She started to slide it to the right getting closer and closer to 200 pounds.  I jumped off the scale right away.

Almost 20 years later, I have kept the weight off and living a more healthy lifestyle (watch my diet and exercise).

Edit - 180 pounds was overweight for me so 200 was approaching obesity.  I now weight 140 pounds."

gout,fd4lli4,t3_ejvdgd,1578168690.0,"Gout runs in my family (my father and mostly all my uncles on both sides of the family).  There are really good medications that basically cure it when you have a flare up (eg allipurinol).  I am surprised your doctor did not go over this with you.  I am assuming a doctor told you have gout.  

Keep living a healthy lifestyle.  Have a good diet/healthy eating, exercise, lots of water daily (I drink a large glass of water right when I wake up in the morning).  This will minimize the attacks.  

It's going to be trial and error as everyone has different trigger foods.  For me, it's excess red meat and excess sugar.  The usual culprits though are organ meat, red meat, alcohol, sugary soda, shell fish, sardines, anchovies, processed food so I avoid these or have really small quantities if I do.

I am 42 years old.  I continue to work-out 4 times a times a week.  I started to feel the symptoms of gout shortly after Christmas (appears on on my toes; this time was on my left one) due to the excess protein and sugar I was consuming due to the holidays.  I took one pill of allipurinol and it was gone within hours.  

Depending on your circumstances, you may need to take daily medications, or if like myself who only get flare-ups very rarely, only when you need to."
