And since I still don’t like underachiement in sports, I have turned that bit other way around. I focus on bettering my self mentally, accepting there are things one can’t control, sometimes just little is enough, etc. and while doing that, yes working also on those other goals. :)"

And it isn’t yet as common in Europe, than in America. Obesity is increasing here too, but still it is not so big percentage. 

Actually there is still even regional differences. Where I live, obesity has increased dramatically within few decades. Constantly all over the news, but I’ve wondered how, since it doesn’t look like it. I mean there’s more and more overweight people, BMI reaching 30 and more weightloss surgery’s are done than previously but still not alarmly much. 

And most of the people with overweight fall still merely into category okay, could lose 20 to 30 lbs. So I’ve been umm okay, so must be it, but where all those people are since I don’t see this irl.

At summer went to countryside. That was the first time I saw in practice ‘the epidemic’.
But even these were still more like could lose  50 to 100 lbs.

So why would I need to focus on reaching some factual benching goal number at the gym? 

Yes, it is good to not over complicate things. And at least occasionally return back to total basics. Also some planning and tracking is a important way to stay motivated. But I’m not accountable with my gym hobby to anybody else than me. Maybe I deadlift within two years time 1,5 x my body weight. Maybe I deside within two months I’ll just focus on pilates.

If some muscle mass is lost on a cut, so be it. Not wise to spend too much time on speculating that. Extensive stress is also harmfull after all. So better just cut wisely, and return as soon as possible to a state, where it is easier actually to gain muscles."

I am totally willing to buy that. Especially since my own personal experience fully supports ’fat can be burned, even within low BMI range, and not without any suppousedly too big damage to metabolism or muscles’.

Just that constantly even some far more reliable sources than some random internet commentors parrot while on calorie deficit, you always lose mostly muscle. Leaner you get, more significally lower your metabolism gets. Etc. 

My personal experience does not support those ’truths’. And thus I am on the same side than you. 

_Actually great to hear, that my personal experiences can be valid._

With the part in order to lose fat in most ’friendly’ way to body it is important to focus on maintaining good levels of resistance training, good sleep and nutrition I suppose we don’t disagree either?

If so, on the contrary. I feel that my personal experiences show _fat really does burn_ if body gets less calories than it would need.  Even when person is lean to begin with.

fatlogic,ffwlddz,t1_ffwhkkx,1580304621.0,"Yes, I agree fully. My bad, should’ve used another phrase with that one. 

What I meant to say, is that based on basic survival rules, body does tend to have priorities. Fat is consired far more important resource than for example muscles and hair. Those are not so important in order to survive thru real famine. 

So in that sense sending body a message - this one again totally as lay man terms - lose the fat, but lemme keep all my hair and muscles, can be a bit unnatural process. 

And disclaimer: I personally have no difficulties of losing fat. I don’t see it as some totally unnatural process.
I sometimes even wonder if I am bit unnatural my self. Since I can’t relate to that ’burning fat is difficult’. I seem to burn it quite decently. It’s not easy, but definately there’s no mystery in it. Not even when losing fat at lower end of healthy BMI and just for vanity purposes ie getting more defined six pack.

I just find this thing fascinating! At least some of the commentors are fairly aware, that fat can be de facto lost even while internet says often otherwise. Based on internet everybody has BMR like 900 and once you hit the BMI 25, fat will never burn. 

I say on the contrary, so far based on my individual human tests, leaner I get, more my body turns into that crazy fat burning machine. This off course most likely because of a semi decent muscle mass to begin with."

fatlogic,ffw84ek,t1_ffvfx95,1580288910.0,"In some circumstances this is bit valid. Not off course always/ usually. 

I am normal BMI. Physically active. Been on a small cut with still highish calorie amount. I have overall good BMR. 

If I would go now on some superrestictive 1200 kcal diet, instead of current cutting with 2000 kcals within few days I would get severe constant headache, lose my energy to train, get constipated, start sleeping bad and getting not enough sleep. Among other symptoms. 

On a scale my weight would rise, quite rapidly several lbs. Most of this would be offcourse just water weight but still. My body would be in extreme stress mode very fast. 

Only after a x time of heavy calorie restriction (have not tested and I rather will not) my weight would start to go down, most likely very rapidly, and this time also straight from muscles instead of mostly fat. 

So in that sense this is valid. Fat burning ’process’ after all is quite unnatural. Fat is more important to body than muscles. Just that any mad amounts is not needed! I personally seem to function 100% even with as little than ~ 22 lbs.

But with a combination of steady calorie intake (I believe in importance of all macros), not too heavy deficit, good quality sleep and maybe most importantly effective resistance training, body can be ’cheated’ to burn rather fat, than muscles. 

Ofcourse this is not a case when somebody is 400 lbs. Body is under so huge stress to begin with, than even a massive calorie restriction is just a drop in an ocean and any kind of starvation mode far far away.

Edit: You who downvoted, I’d appreciate bit more constructive feedback. Do you know better than me, how my body reacts to severe calorie restriction?

You are talking about your experience. 
Which has keywords like rapid and extreme. And those are the one’s that make the difference. And why it is fair still to say weight loss does not it self cause stretch marks. 

In order to that happen, skin had to be streched rapidly to begin with. 

If 160 lbs person loses 20 pounds (that they have gained like most do - during years) super fast, it is still very likely no new strech marks since the skin wasn’t damaged to begin with. 

At first there might be some loose skin present, but since it is still healthyskin, and which is elastic with healing it self capasity it can even shrink back fully. 

If 400 lbs person loses 100 lbs rapidly, basically anything can happen. Skin was so damaged, with earlier stretch marks from weight gain to begin with. 
It can well be possible that even more strech marks appear, if that loose skin is in a form like appron and moves more and even painfully since it’s just basically empty. 

So still: Within normal weight range while losing weight it is fair to say it does not cause strech marks."

But actually to stretch more? Better give actual sources to support that.

*Edited to add than in cases where there’s enormous amount of skin left (like empty tummy skin to your knees) think that  extra stretching is possible. I assume that amount does wiggle constantly even in painfully ways since it is really loose, and looser than it was.

So it comes to a fact it ain’t easy. 

It can even be practically impossible if several other challenging aspects are present in life. 

And so: A huge motivation is needed. But where do you get the motivation, if you never even had personal experience of how things could be? 

Even I who is this easy it is for you since you are so diciplined with healthy attitude towards food and don’t work double shift or have no mental problems, or no small children and for years ’naturally’ lean sporty person with good muscle memory and who has become addicted to working out and knows lot of nutrition and even helps other people with their training as a side job -person had difficulties to actually start once again my ’fit life’ after long involuntary break due to several injuries. 

My shoulders were officially cleared okay back to training and into that lifestyle months before than my mind was. 

And this all while I actually knew beforehand, how awesome it is to be overall energized, how good it feels to sleep well, how lovely it is to challenge your self physically, how rewarding it is to actually actively work towards general well being, how overall good feeling it is what one gets from clean eating and not being constantly bloated etc. Not to mention things like scale is just a tool, not enemy. 

Then there’s always the some what narsistic aspects. Now, when those certain things are back in my mirror I must admit that I absolutely love seeing those pretty (to my liking) details on my body like cut arms, abs and round glutes. 

I have heard that these things don’t define who you are. Maybe so, but they do make ME damn happy. So possibly my biggest motivation this time was ’want to have them back’. 

But how I did it, was gradually. First upped generic cardio, then started basic training and only once that was really routine, cleanish eating, and after those were okay, actually set once again some more serious goals and started a cut. If I’d done that all in once, most likely would have already reached point fuck this shit. 

Tldr: It ain’t even supposed to be easy. Else everybody would be madly ripped. 

Many people struggle to find enough motivation, since they have even no previous experience of what the factual rewards could be.

Add denial to that. And which can be even biggest factor!

I happen to know several of these naturally thin people. Finally at their forties they have started to get some fluffyness. And they are extremely happy! Because their whole life they were skinny bashed. So when ever somebody thinks that thin people live automatically in some divine bliss - well, it can be far from that."

It’s more often just a symptom of inner insecurity, or maybe even a sign person thinks they are more notable than they actually are. 

This is not only weight related. Read from Hair subs ’everybody today was staring my hair.’ Why would I care enough to stare what kind of hairdo some total stranger has?
And most importantly, if a new person enters gym, of course I notice but why would I give a flying fuck about their clothing, body composition etc.? I am busy with my training.

I have also heard that I have absolutely no right even comment on anything that’s weight loss or calorie restriction related. Since I am thin and always have been. 

Well. I was chubby child. Started my first diet 9 years old. Reason that I’ve never been obese, is that my whole life I have been doing actively things, choises and decisions to avoid it. Even in too extreme ways.

While one get’s to hear about the error margin constantly, my numbers are surprisingly accurate and logical. 

I mean it’s all there. That’s the point I stopped bro split, there shows the time I had to limit core training, that must be right before I had my recreational scoliosis once again fixed. It is sort of data that can’t be manipulated. 

Overall my gains seem to be tiny, but that’s expected since haven’t been able to reach even two years of consistent training ever. So basically I’m just always starting once again. Previously around 4 months my lean body mass was 53,7, muscle mass 29,7 and bf 17,2. (Eight months more training and +0,8 to muscle mass and 1,2 decrease in bf.)

So if I don’t reach those figures now, it is time to question my current routine. Both useful and motivating. I compete only against me."
xxfitness,ffl78f7,t1_ffkd2j7,1580035811.0,"Based on google it might have bit bigger error margin than InBody. But then again, only way to actually measure amount of body fat and muscle is on autopsy table. And goes without saying no gains are to be expected after that. DXA I suppose is most accurate but that isn’t available to everybody and I suspect is quite expensive. I rather use that money on protein and gym leggings. Which both help me to perform. 


I do InBody occasionally. It is after all more realiable than eye or measuring tape. 
And measuring biceps is not even measuring biceps. Also tricep size has effect there. 

Anyhow, measuring them was actually fun! Think I continue doing that. Especially since I think I suffer from common disease ‘The day you start lifting, is the day you became forever small.’ 
And I do have body dismorphia. Supposedly mild, but as a ex ED, I still have occasional big problems of being able to understand mirror. There are just things that I do not see. I need to have them told to me verbally, or by exact numbers. I for example had no idea until recently that I have long legs. Only found out that when I was trying to determine why I simply can’t squat in a form many others do. So I measured my femurs, did googling and asked an professional opinion. Result: long legs and I was like whaddafuck. :D

Thus I go by combination of body weight, measuring tape and Inbody. I also use other people’s measurements as a reference point. 

Have found this to be extremely usefull. And getting quite good at it. Three months ago, when I was starting my normal gym regime again after three years involuntary break that had zero consistency, I took basic body measurements, and was able to know my current body weight by 100 grams accurancy. 
Gonna take new InBody numbers in near future, but no hurry with that since I can use older measures in guesstimating body fat and thus also BMR and TDEE."

That google average is bit difficult in a way that there are so many other factors. 
Height, bicep peak, bodyfat% etc. 

I’m tallish, lowbf, arms are always my least fatty places, I don’t have a good peak there, and besides that my biceps are lacking. :D

Could be thou that my ability to recover sucks. I mean at some point I noticed that combination of heavy leg workout and 7 to 8 km of walking also on those days was just too much. 

Am currently on a cut, and want to train hard so I have actually lessen my other activity. Basically it’s just work - gym - rest. All the additional normal life activities have been taken to a minimum temporarily. And so I currently average 6k steps daily. (On short people that would mean even 12k.) On an active rest day I hit that ~ 8-10k steps. 

So my activity is gym 4 times a week hard, 1 light workout. One light cardio.

Overall really sedentary. 5’7, cw 140 lbs, cutting with 2000 kcals. Weight loss surprisingly steady 0,5 kg per week, so -500 defiency is in effect. 

Once I get to maintenance that’s 2500. 
But since also activity increases, it’s more likely like 2800 and occasionally above that. I’ve been even to 3500 at my leanest, and that was really unpleasant."
xxfitness,ffkqmvb,t3_ete86h,1580027182.0,"Well basically once you get really into shape, it is easier just to maintain, or not to lose all progress. 

But it doesn’t change the fact body and muscles get used to same stimuli, and eventually what was enough to maintain, isn’t anymore. 

Besides that, imagine yourself going to the gym next fifty years twice a week and ‘I’m just maintaining’. I am sure you lose the motivation. 

And motivation (among rewards) brings consistency and sustainability. 

So it all comes to basic if it was easy, everybody would be doing it. 

No, you shouldn’t train so hard that is has an negative impact for the rest of your day. But I am bit baffled to read these comments here that say not even much sweat needed, all should feel nice, no tiredness right after workout. After all discomfort zone is where the gains start."

What’s funny with this all is that actually now a days my aesthetic goals _are_ gazillion times more specific. After all my goals used to be more like just ‘to be skinny’. 

But the difference here is that I don’t stress about my body anymore, and I am accepting and loving towards it. 

Also what I consider as fit has changed a lot during years. It is most likely also different than among people who are not into hypertrophy training. After long involuntary break one could say I am back to that generic ‘very fit’. But from my point of view, I’m only just getting started once again! 

Which includes certain bodyfat %, and several other physical characteristics. But I really like the sculpting part in hypertrophy training, and thus actually always have enjoyed that okay there’s new roundness, that might be dominating, that is lacking -part. No stress - it is fascinating. Would hate to reach a point where isn’t anything to improve anymore. 

Only negative thing with this is that these things can’t be shared ‘publicly’. ‘Normal’ people consider you being mad, if cutting while already in perfectly healthy weight, or if happy of getting exellent pump, new vein/definition etc. :D

I also absolutely adore some Bikini Fitness women. But I should really concentrate more on my delts and glutes. 
With delts can’t enough because injury, with glutes while I am first time ever bit prioritizing them, my basic attitude is still there’s so many other body parts to train too and overall functionality matters to me more, so.. 

There we go. I just focus on being me in my body. Which does include some goals. Not like obsessing about anything, but I do get bit tired sometimes in hearing ’truths’ like maintaining below 20 bodyfat % is not realistic goal on a woman. Well - on me it is. So I do that."

Then again on my ‘fattest’ days BMI ~ 23 (practically no muscle mass, several years of zero real physical activity) even when officially still in normal weight range I started to get these feelings like hated my body, didn’t want to see it from mirror, the scale and food was my enemy, felt always really tired, had to start wearing loose clothes, was constantly afraid of gaining more weight, started to feel jealousy towards fit women, didn’t enjoy sex, was overall angry constantly since really did feel shit being me, avoided camera, started to have even then some health problems etc. No control what so ever. And guess this is similar of many others feel when experiencing overweight. 

That was really really far from ‘full life’.

Fast rewind to my fit days. I finally have positive self image. There are parts I don’t like in my body, but I don’t hate anything or have any crisis. There are actually many parts that I even love. I don’t mind being naked, I often even like what I see in the mirror. I am fit so I have good stamina, I can carry somewhat heavy things, my body feels and looks healthy. The scale is just a device, I can eat whatever I want without guilt. (Usually I actually want eat healthy.) Overall any stress about my looks or eating is gone. I am not afraid of getting fat either, because I know how to lose weight healthily if needed. Great feeling also to pick up clothing thinking that looks nice and I don’t worry if I look fat in it. In control again, but in a way there is no need to some constant control.

As I write this, laying on couch. Have my knees bent a bit. I contracted other cheek, then other. Even when my legs don’t move I’d say my thigh makes the first command and that is delivered to the glute. I always at first when I’m connecting to any of my muscles, literally think about it and about the exact place it is in. So this time at first I thought about right cheek, then left cheek and repeat. While doing that ’listened’ how it goes, ’heard’ tights are the one saying ’contract’, and now I am just repeating the movement starting the command from leg. In my mind. One cheek at a time :D

The ’truths’ include:

- One has to always bulk in order to gain any muscle

- Only tall people can eat more than 2000 cals per day without going fat

- 4 lbs is such a small amount of fat or muscle on (tall) person that it can’t ever be seen
- It is impossible to reach lower body fat% like 20 without being super athlete
- If metabolism/BMR is currently low, that’s the state it is gonna be forever
- Sometimes working out less (especially with what comes to cardio) can never mean more muscle gains could be actually achieved. 
- If you are over 30, and have xx-chromosomes why even try. Since because you are female, muscle growth is so small any case and once over 30 also muscle atrophy starts, not to mention decrease in metabolism. (Yes, so it goes, but those things can be even reversed.)

Women can grow muscle, women can lift heavy, some women can eat even more than some men. Naturally because less testosterone and generally smaller frame that muscle growth and overall strength levels are usually less than on men. But it doesn’t mean those things can’t happen. To claim so is just basically misogymism that we are unfortunately too used to.

I am tallish, with good proportions, longish legs and arms and overall quite small frame, but never ever even on my most leanest days (did modeling too) I wasn’t able to fully reach that Bambi look. My build is more of a athletic one, if that makes any sense to you?

By no means I don’t consider my self as a person who builds up muscle a lot, nor easily. But I am definitely not a so called hard gainer. I’m also prone to good muscle separation, so even small gains tend to show quite easily. 

And so at some point I finally gave up! Realized there is no sense of trying to look like Bambi since that’s undoable. Why not focus instead to that ‘she does sports’ -look, since that one I can reach and maintain. And what’s best, without starving.

xxfitness,ffbhf6v,t1_ffagpq8,1579765429.0,">four pounds of fat or muscle in a tallish person isn’t gonna be visible really.

Why not? Depends fully on current body fat %, overall level of muscularity and muscle separation. Also individual muscle insertion points matter. 

Also not like fat distribution is never totally even. Often one doesn’t also gain or lose fat totally evenly. 

I’m doing a cut atm. The whole cut is just 6,5 lbs and I can assure you I noticed even the first 0,5 lbs. Because when I’m starting out a cut on already quite low bf level, that unfortunately leaves from boobs. Next to go was that small filling on hips, then glutes and thights, also some on abs and yes, that 2 lbs really shows both visually and with measuring tape. Still around 2 lbs to go, and which I carry on my waist and lower tummy. 

Ofc if my starting weight and body fat % had been considerably higher, it would always be harder to notice some small gains/ losses. 

But 4 lbs can be totally noticeably on a tallish person. Same principle with muscles. 

A generic reasonable good amount on female (experienced and natural before hitting realistic maximum levels) to gain muscle is around 8 to 9 lbs per year. Why would any tall person ever even lift, if 4 lbs could’t be noticed? 

Btw. just only yesterday noticed new muscle on my biceps. Most likely that’s like 20 grams instead of a hundred. But it is visible. Are they big and really round? No, that’s where height matters."
xxfitness,ffbesps,t1_ff9psit,1579762191.0,Why that much protein? What’s your weight?
xxfitness,ff9fkmm,t1_ff9da4j,1579711949.0,"I doubt that I lift heavier than others. On the contrary - I am officially weak as fuck! I simply can’t lift heavy because of my joints. My all time record with deadlift is my bodyweight (not RM luckily but as in set weights). With squats I am even worse than that. 

I do thou tend to train quite heavy in other ways. Meaning trying always as much as I can to be in the discomfort zone. With assistance of big volume and minimal rest."
xxfitness,ff9c8oo,t1_ff96m62,1579709689.0,"See my reply above. Your numbers are your numbers, not a total truth that applies to everybody. :)"
xxfitness,ff9c1nm,t1_ff95whc,1579709544.0,"5’7 seven here. CW ~ 141 lbs. I cut currently around 2000, so when I’m finished with my project, my maintenance is most likely once again around 2500, or even 2800. 

Yes, ofc lean mass matters. 

But I am also a office worker. So that part of my life is really sedentary. I am also mentally a bodybuilder (thou not physically) which comes with basic attitude ’You can’t flex cardio.’ So doing cardio only as little as I have to as well. 
I do hypertrophy training 4 to 5 times per week. Heavy sessions yes, but it is generally agreed, that it is not the best way just to burn calories. 

Tldr: Some people, even middle aged women can really have quite high BMR and TDEE."
xxfitness,ff8vowo,t3_es9xu0,1579697667.0,"Last night was doing one of my favourite exercises especially on a cut and that being serious couch potato session. (Recovery is even more important when cutting). While extending my other arm in order to reach remote control saw some new shape in my bicep! 

Yep, they are still small but that shape was not there earlier. I was honestly what! Can’t be fat either, my arms were really unfatty to begin with. I can see veins on my biceps. Just that have not ever seen much muscle in them unless with mad pump. 

So there we go. While it is not very common to be able to gain muscle on calorie deficit, it can happen. Naturally I’m not talking either of getting a lot of muscle. But some small gains really can happen. I’ve experienced this also before. 

Don’t let those common internet mantras to depress, just train hard, and see what happens. Maybe you lose muscle, maybe you stall, maybe you are even able to get small progress while cutting."
xxfitness,ff8kuqn,t1_ff8bvu1,1579683358.0,"Rather make adjustments after two weeks. Six weeks is enough time to mess things up even quite badly. You don’t want to end up in a too big defiency either. That’s just a form of masocism and can result losing muscle mass. 

(On first week, if there’s a bigger drop, it’s most likely water weight first. Later on depending how linear you weight loss is, monitor/ adjust things once a week or every two weeks until weight loss is on a steady rate of - 0,5 kg per week.)"
