offmychest,fgm9lyk,t3_ez8fc9,1580920469.0,You should join us over at r/Maladaptive Daydreaming! And the alternative life you have is called a paracosym. I had a real hard time with this when I was younger but as an adult I'm super focused compared to most.
LeavingNeverlandHBO,fglrhoi,t3_ez443h,1580909036.0,The horrors of how their parents were was quite strange. I honestly understand why he tried to cover up or prevent a lot of further memory trauma after his brother's accident. He just wanted to give him that chance to never know or remember.

pastlives,fgkqdm3,t3_eyzhle,1580871290.0,"All I know is that his name is Roman in THIS life.  But I've never seen him and I'm also married to someone else. He is also tied to someone else in this life but we met in a dream. The dream combined several places. Places I know, like a strip club I used to tend bar at. Except he was tending bar. And places I didn't know that maybe we would see. I don't know that we will meet up. And he was so short and I am so tall. But the connection and conversation was amazing."

TrueOffMyChest,fgk9tm7,t1_fgk8jkk,1580860620.0,"Okay, I get it. Yeah I have lurked, commented, gotten banned. It was sadly the first thing crazy I stumbled upon in Reddit. I'm a woman with 2 daughters and a son and I stay away because this shit makes me sick to think about. I'll never forget this guy posting about planning to literally rape his sister. Who was 9. I just can't. These fuckers better be glad they stay behind a computer, in my opinion. But that still don't make it okay or right. Should they be censored? You're right- it's literally  Occam's Razor. Chose to identify them and not act because it isn't legal or chose to let it spurn others to commit such acts because they are rallied around and supported? To me, knowing the depravity doesn't make us the wiser. We know it exists. Because you don't have to imagine the depravity of these men, you really just need to know it could happen to you or your own and that dark people roam this world."
TrueOffMyChest,fgk76ig,t1_fgk64pj,1580858949.0,Just curious why you would be interested in the psychology of that at all then?
Anger,fgk72jd,t3_eyyipg,1580858879.0,"I get it. I hate dealing with drunks when I am sober. And I guess lesson learned because now you know not to ever let this woman become your problem again. I would give your girlfriend a pass since she just had no clue this time.  But honestly,  you could tell the ""vibe"" from the night was not in your favor from the get-go. Just a personal opinion, I tend to be the person that says ""no"" to situations now. It's because I used to be easily the person that ended up being used/lied to a lot."
TrueOffMyChest,fgk5r58,t1_fgjpdxw,1580858073.0,You're livid because you are one LOL. Any sub that validates rape of women and girls is something I'm sure we can really do without.  And that would be promoting violence to a specific group.
offmychest,fgj4zjn,t1_fgiw59h,1580837084.0,"Omg in my 20s I lived out a similar sinister scenario but the female version and a very drawn out HR process. I also felt I had a case and I look back at it and the only thing I knew to do at that time with 2 little girls was to keep moving forward and never look back. Everyone in that scenario walked away with something. I learned loyalty is for people, not jobs. My ex boss learned she cannot and will never supervise a staff. You're welcome, it's the one thing I could accomplish. The only thing I want back is all the money I paid into my 401k which they claim I never had. Yeah. I will see the end of this, eventually but yeah. Never again on a lot of things."

rant,fgh1fma,t3_eye9rd,1580774414.0,"I'll never forget the first time I heard the word ""overqualified"", which I thought I would never hear. For a hotel desk manager job. I looked right at the lady and told her I wasn't above doing anything with the most genuine smile on my face. Still didn't get the job. The universe tends to unfold as it should. My old job called me back when they found me a work from home spot. My opinion? Every job I ever got I pretty much did it by connection. I knew someone that knew someone that got me in the door. I pretty well knew I had secured the job before I filled out the application.  I once landed a job as a city manager assistant with no experience that I really regrettably could not stay at all because I walked by a lady's office and bullshitted with her because I was new in town and looking for another department. Track down your friends/parents friends with other companies and see what they can do for you. And fuck Indeed. Useless. Go to a staffing agency if you're going to do that."
JUSTNOMIL,fgfi2jv,t3_exziga,1580739333.0,"I overhead my MIL tell my husband over 11 years ago when I was coming back from the bathroom that I should ""just get an abortion"". Believe it or not, I chose to let that slide at the time since things were early on and she had only met me one other time. I told myself it was because she thought it was ""too soon"" and he already had two small sons with his ex wife and hadn't been divorced long. And then there was a time after that where I ""overheard her"" tell her friend while I was doing her dishes that the movie Monster-in-Law was something she couldn't wait to do to her sons' wife. I realized at that point it was ""on"", basically and she made a few more attempts to ""befriend me"" and run over us and then we had a blow up at Thanksgiving and we haven't spoken since.  All that happened within a YEAR so youd be surprised how fast things move in the MIL game."
TrueOffMyChest,fgfgu9y,t1_fgedk6j,1580738346.0,"You are contradictory as hell! First you say you're okay with the racist stuff that goes up on the Donald and that people should have ""freedom of speech"" and then turn around in the same sentence and say you ""don't condone such behavior"" but we should let them do it anyway so they ""dont get too crazy"". Okay, that IS crazy. It like saying you shouldnt have sex with little kids but looking at pedo material won't spur someone to do something like that, it will keep them ""more in check/sane."" No, my friend. People like you are blinded by the fact that you want your cake and want to eat it, too."
TrueOffMyChest,fgfgab8,t1_fgefevg,1580737888.0,"There is a clause in that doctrine of Freedom of Speech f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others"" or ""[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (order public), or of public health or morals"". So no, letting these idiots ""coalesce"" is not part of that."
TrueOffMyChest,fgeasji,t1_fgdk059,1580695304.0,"Hell no. And get rid of Incels, Braincels, MGTOW, pedoz, and Feminazis (I hope you bitches never have sons) and any and all people that can't accept another for their skin, or beliefs (unless their beliefs are harmful to others)."
TrueOffMyChest,fgeadjk,t1_fgdkyil,1580695027.0,"So are the Juggalos, if that puts things into perspective."
TrueOffMyChest,fgea6im,t1_fgdqb0y,1580694899.0,"So by default, incels should be allowed to talk about how to accomplish a rape or a nutcase should be allowed to talk about blowing up a school, or pedophiles should be allowed to post their horrific content because we should be allowed ""free speech""? There's a clause in that doctrine where  it says [f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others"" or ""[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (order public), or of public health or morals]"" So although I DO identify right wing, and I DID vote for yours truly, I find that perpetuating hate the that can be found there (and this does go for those feminists that hate men as well!) At the expense of others is not something I can say actually falls under that freedom of speech you cry."

survivinginfidelity,fg41sff,t1_fg3brcy,1580494365.0,"This so much. My husband made this mistake in his first marriage. I thought a guy I dated before him would be into that and learned some guys aren't and that I wasn't really that much into it either. You know, I think it's an easy ""mistake"" a lot of people make when they are younger. I put it in quotes, because for some people -it does work.   And you want to think you're there too, because you don't realize that's it's also okay to say no. For a vast majority, you have to learn when it comes to the best of both worlds. Some of us don't realize that saying no protects the marriage. It seems like you're the boundary stomper but it's really your spouse being a boundary pusher and you are the boundary establisher. And having boundaries drawn out is important and okay."
rant,fg3gzqb,t1_fg2x9j5,1580481294.0,"Around $800 here. Not sure what I'm actually paying for except being ""allowed"" to go to the doctor. Because in my opinion, that's what your insurance card is. It's just a pass to get you in there because it basically states they are getting SOME money, whether from the insurance company or the patient or both, if they are lucky and the patient gives a shit. My son had a $14,000 surgery. My daughter has to get a tooth pulled down. My other daughter and myself are blind as a bat so it doesn't just end stop at medical."
rant,fg3g50d,t1_fg31xym,1580480673.0,"Right there with you! And honestly I don't gaf. These people don't care about you either. The level of what Americans pay for versus the level of what we get when we pay for it it far beyond the level of comprehension our country ever intended at this point. All I know, is OP being single (I assume) is one of the lucky things at this sad point in our country. Family insurance is even worse, imo."
