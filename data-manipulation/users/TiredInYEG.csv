alberta,ffpi518,t1_ffphnmq,1580095614.0,That’s great. Thanks for your opinion. It’s especially valued because I know how much courage it must’ve taken you to post it. I’m proud of you.
alberta,ffph3e0,t1_ffpgseu,1580094889.0,Congrats on the job prospect. Here’s hoping it works out for us.
alberta,ffpghmh,t1_ffpft3e,1580094463.0,I’m getting a very forever alone vibe from you right now and I honestly just wish you the best.
alberta,ffpffse,t3_euhlc1,1580093716.0,"This is cruel. But it’s not a surprise. Jason Kenney has made a career of stealing the remaining dignity and comfort of dying spouses. I honestly feel helpless. We are all deserving of so much more compassion than this. 


If anyone has ideas on how we can fight back, I’d love to hear it."

Albertapolitics,ffcpjj4,t3_esmusa,1579804481.0,"Supervised consumption sites save lives. The data is pretty clear. What’s been said in the past week by people like Rick Bell in the sun and by the premier on Twitter (NDP drug sites) is the type of stigma furthering language that can actually force people away from seeking help, living ashamed and being more at risk of overdose and death. We need to create the type of society that encourages people to seek out SCSs.

I understand people have concerns, but these sites are saving lives. OD deaths are declining. Over 4,500 overdoses were reversed between Jan 2018 and last September. 

These people are our friends, family, neighbours and fellow Albertans. Their lives are just as important as anyone else’s. If the premier could stop being such a compassionless fuckboi, maybe he’d see that. 

Then again, this is the schlub that got giddy about keeping dying AIDS patients away from their loved ones. The Roy Cohn of Alberta, everyone."
EdmontonMarijuana,ffb1hef,t3_esfirc,1579749440.0,"Wow. That would cost me around $5000 at the store (bad at math, rough estimate). You’ve inspired me to look into growing my own."

Albertapolitics,felb5l6,t1_fekmq2u,1579218063.0,"Before we ask those working on the front lines of the medical profession to take a wage freeze which is a cut when factoring Inflation and the surgery the gov just did to their overtime pay, let’s tax the rich appropriately first and stop giving away our money to rich corporations that would rather leave the province than create jobs here. If after all that, we’re still in a bind, we should introduce a small provincial sales tax. And if that still doesn’t fix things, fire the people in charge in the next election.  Actually, I’m for doing that last part first."
Albertapolitics,fejsocm,t1_feivn14,1579184887.0,"Should you ever need them, I’m sure you’ll receive amazing care and respect regardless of your own ignorance. 

But listen up. Alberta’s nurses don’t deserve this public attack. They’ve been thrown into the middle of a petty government’s fight to drive down private wages by gutting the public sector before privatization. Focus your energy on that. Nurses signed up to serve, to help us in our most vulnerable and sometimes frightening moments. It’s a hell of a job. They deserve to be treated and compensated fairly for the work they do. Not exorbitant. Fair. 

It sounds like things have maybe been tough for you over the past decade. I’m sorry if that’s the case. But at the very least, give our nurses the respect they’d give you. Your fight isn’t with them."

aww,feeitpd,t3_eonffw,1579034620.0,"What a lucky child. Congrats to your family and the extraordinary journey of love that you’re on. Being a parent is the easiest hard thing I’ve ever done. I haven’t slept in 5 years but my heart is full. 

Not that you’re asking advice, but in case it helps, here goes... write everything down in as much original detail as you can. The sleep deprivation can make you forgetful. The small things become big and vice versa. 

As parents we get to live nostalgia in real time. It’s a gift. I’m happy for you. Good luck!"
aww,feehwps,t1_fee8rlq,1579034090.0,"Oh wow. That’s beautiful. Reminds me of EE Cummings saying, “I carry your heart(I carry it in my heart.”

Thanks for sharing these words."

Albertapolitics,fcg4xfx,t1_fcaxsa7,1577636495.0,"I don’t know. Some of this stuff seems petty. But I get the frustration. I’m in favour of LRT but not in the way it’s being implemented. In terms of homelessness, I found this opinion piece interesting. It’s not really about Iveson, but I know that when he first ran, he spoke a lot about ending homelessness: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-edmonton-treats-homelessness-like-the-disaster-it-is-and-is-getting/

Don isn’t perfect, however, I have a hard time lumping him in with Kenney. That’s like comparing apples to fascists."
