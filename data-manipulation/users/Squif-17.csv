giantbomb,fgpoobm,t1_fgn5ued,1581009005.0,Literally a Diet Coke version of a sports movie.
todayilearned,fgpofzl,t1_fgph7vv,1581008875.0,"So true, when we walked up to it we both sorta stood there like... “is that? Oh god it is!”  

Rome is so wonderful like that!"
Games,fgot07a,t3_eziqvm,1580985161.0,As a Diablo fan this is exciting. As a Gears fan it’s a little sad.
todayilearned,fgos32g,t1_fgor3cn,1580983863.0,"No shit....... We were just strolling around one evening as I said. 

We did plenty of planned sight seeing. But this was just a point about how Rome is so chock full of history that you can stumble upon it anywhere you go."
reddevils,fgopqa1,t1_fgn9og7,1580980487.0,Beckham was so good at passing he made it feel like we had an extra player on the pitch.
todayilearned,fgop532,t1_fgo3awi,1580979626.0,"My wife and I were just strolling around Rome one evening after dinner, walked up a side street and BAM there’s the Pantheon. 

Was so amazing to effectively stumble upon it. 

Then we ate a shit ton of gelato. Was a good time."

Go on Ighalo."
Dentistry,fgm2aug,t1_fgm0i75,1580916543.0,"Considering the tooth has been missing nearly a decade would the implant still be viable? 

Would it likely require a bone graft or something along those lines? 

I know any advice you can give is anecdotal as you can’t see my mouth, x-rays, etc. But just asking based on your experience."
Dentistry,fglu7lu,t1_fglszyu,1580911041.0,"I feel like implants are so popular that all I hear about bridges is doom and gloom... 

Bridging is still a viable option even if I’m in my late 20s / 30s right? 

I get that all things fail over time but I’ve really stepped up my hygiene since I got over my phobia and started regularly seeing the dentist. 

I just really don’t want the upper crowned molar to “super erupt” to a point where it’s lost and I have two gaps. 

So in my head bridging sounds marginally better than leaving it despite it costing me the structural integrity of two teeth."
