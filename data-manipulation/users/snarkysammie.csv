unpopularopinion,fef73zt,t1_fee3kct,1579049745.0,Wow... that’s one of the most prejudicial and insane comments I’ve ever seen. There are a lot of ways to contribute to society beyond monetarily. Were you just posting another unpopular opinion? If not... You might want to find somewhere else to live that better aligns with your twisted beliefs. Or go back to the 18th century.

Does that mean I also went off on them being chauvinists, ageists and whatever you would call hating those who don’t own property? Again, get over yourself. Some people just have to find a reason to bitch."
unpopularopinion,fed7yq8,t1_fed7vdy,1579003031.0,What? I didn’t say they were racist. Wtf. It’s a fact that the Revolutionary War led to only a narrow group being able to vote. Get over yourself.

But...

Nationalism creates an us vs them mentality. That for us to benefit we have to take pleasure in others’ harm or defeat.

Being born in this country is not an individual accomplishment and does not make one better or more deserving than someone born elsewhere.

Nationalism is a display of selfishness, greed and superiority.

Nationalism promotes prejudice, isolationism and fragments our communities as people take the aforementioned us vs them mentality. 

While patriotism consists of pushing to make America better, which includes taking a critical view of our country, nationalists believe that we are already superior and feel it’s unAmerican to point out our nation’s flaws and strive to change them. 

In a modern context, a person is rarely both.

I’m going to provide additional sources, not because I am basing my opinions on someone else’s, but because it’s unrealistic fo me to write an entire essay in a Reddit post. This source promotes my thoughts, it did not create them. I’m not such a sheep that I base my ideals on some Ivy-leaguer. I am fully capable of studying and forming my own thoughts. 

Donald Trump is no patriot.

And one of the best explanations of this concept came from journalist PJ O’Rourke:

“The difference between patriotism and nationalism is the difference between the love a father has for his family and the love a Godfather has for his ‘family.’”

theview,fecroqz,t1_fecrek4,1578982063.0,You obviously didn’t pay much attention to the Harvard article. No longer worth my time.
freelanceWriters,fecrmob,t3_eoghpt,1578982005.0,"Just be professional. Introduce yourself, say you are reaching out on behalf of whatever publication, and that you’re working on an article about whatever it is. Explain you’re hoping to get some expert feedback and would they mind if you ask a couple of questions. If you are reaching out in writing, you can go ahead and add a coupe of questions. If you have more than a couple of questions, I would hold off on them until you get a reply so your contact doesn’t get overwhelmed by your initial contact.

For example:

Hello, Mr. Smith. It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. My name is Joe Jones, and I’m reaching out on behalf of Some Magazine.com. I’m currently working on an article about growing grass, and I’m hoping to include some feedback from experts on the matter. Would you mind answering a couple of questions about your area of expertise? 

Question 1

Question 2

Thank you in advance for spending a few minutes of your valuable time to offer some feedback. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or concerns. 

Thanks again,

Patriotism is the love and affection one feels for his country. The feeling of patriotism is based on the values a country espouses and the way it strives to improve. Patriotism is based on the belief in the inherent goodness of the system of government in a country, and the goodness of its people. 


Nationalism is the love and affection one feels for his country. However, nationalism is rooted in the belief that one’s country is superior to all others, and carries the connotation of disapproval of other nations or a rivalry with other nations. While patriotism does not disparage other countries, nationalism builds up one’s own country by tearing other countries down. Nationalism supports dominating other countries.
