RetroPie,ffb1ttx,t1_ffay9ed,1579749674.0,there is a 5Ah battery and charging circuit built it. Building  circuit to power and charge simultaneously took the largest amount of time on this project. Details on the charging circuit can be found here  [https://github.com/Aboyd656/RetroPie-Switch](https://github.com/Aboyd656/RetroPie-Switch)

Also, I started a github page for the project a whole back but never finished it. I never finished compiling all the code together, so you would have to pick through the programs. https://github.com/Aboyd656/RetroPie-Switch/"

RetroPie,ff7zp8e,t1_ff7y860,1579662232.0,"Yes and no, I'm a mechanical engineer that specializes in industrial automation. Most of my electrical knowledge is self taught. But my education gave me the tools to help develop the skills. The thing about most projects is that in some manner it has always been done before. In this project for example, two people had found a way to connect the joycons, but never really finished implementing them, or it didn't work with current builds of raspbian. Someone else had figured out the charging circuit, I just scaled it up to handle the current draw of a raspberry pi.

The case was the only thing I designed from scratch.

Start with a small electronics project like controlling an addressable led strip with an arduino and go from there. This stuff isn't that complicated, it's just daunting thinking about starting it."

RetroPie,ff7rrhj,t1_ff64pvf,1579656776.0,"I am, I figured I'd wait till there was a stable release of emulation station, from what I understand it still takes a lot of manual work to get it going. I'm still working on getting through some PS1 games, so the desire for better n64 emulation hasn't driven me to upgrade yet. To be honest though I'm not sure I am the type to make a full walk through :/"
RetroPie,ff7r3jy,t1_ff6qr2e,1579656312.0,"I mapped the buttons to a virtual keyboard. It's not a perfect method of doing it but it works. The only real drawback is you don't get analog feedback from the joysticks. Or at least that's been my experience. The bluetooth range isn't great either, maybe 10' with the metal case I have on the Pi. There is some documentation on the thingiverse page I linked on how to do it. I've been meaning to get a full compilation the programs I am running but haven't had a chance too."
