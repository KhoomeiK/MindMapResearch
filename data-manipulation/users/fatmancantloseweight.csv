AskReddit,ffguicd,t1_ffgdju8,1579915394.0,"yup. after i got a girlfriend, girls started messaging me just to talk about whatever.

they no longer seem uncomfortable when we talk, and conversation just opens up more.

i wanna say its just because i learned to talk to girls, but nah. im the same ol me."
todayilearned,ffe6vxw,t1_ffd69xf,1579838292.0,"Iirc japan had the most powerful navy back then.

And they were all concentrated back on  Japan's coastline during the time.

A deployment to front line japan would be to literally run straight into a wall of navy turrets guns and missiles.

The front line would literally be wiped out the second they were registered on the navy's radar.

However, I think the US deliberately set the stage to be like that, so they can go with the stance of "" we can go with either the most horrific us military casualty in the history of the usa"" or ""we drop two measly bombs that will wipe out literally everything and japan WILL surrender, and the frontline can literally stroll into town unscathed""."

rickandmorty,ff4qm5e,t3_eriq4q,1579570087.0,"The feeling I get is that we the audience are treated as third party morty.

In the sense that morty, like us, has a general idea as to how rick is gonna act, and what is gonna happen, but because Morty is Rick's grandson, he has a biased view of rick, the expectation that his grandpa is not gonna do/say anything fucked up, and yet, here we are.

At the same time, ricks behaviour is totally excusable, because more often than not, rick has the situation down pat and accurate. So all you can really do as a morty is to just shut the fuck up, and go along for the ride."

nottheonion,feihldk,t1_feh2iuh,1579138712.0,"Way back when this was allowed in English court, trial by combat between men and women would be held with the man in a hole, standing at waist height to provide a handicap.

https://www.aemma.org/onlineResources/trial_by_combat/combat_man_and_woman.htm

Edit: what's interesting is, the woman is provided a sap (a heavy object like a stone attached to a cloth), and the man a club, both at the same length. The importance of this is, the sap is easier to wield effectively, and can easily cause more damage.

So the man has 3 disadvantages, 


1. he loses height, which men often have over women, and the advantage is given to the woman, and is very advantageous.

2. His mobility is restricted to a tiny hole. So speed and mobility doesnt matter anymore, the advantage is now given to the woman.

3. His strength and effectiveness was neutralized by weapon choices."

loseit,fec6m9w,t1_fec3qkd,1578967527.0,"i strongly do not advise what i did, because it was foolish, and stemmed from mental illness (depression & anorexia & bulimia).

the only reason it worked out was because i was severely overweight, and any restriction was a chance for my body to actually rest and work on maintenance and use up all the nutrition stores in my body.

so... what i did was carried out in phases.

month 1.

cutting out carb food (like pasta, rice, noodles etc). only protein and veggies.

month 2.

cut protein and veggies by half.

month 3.

only breakfast, but reintroduce carbs. binge on one weekend meal. that was normally saturday. that means i have 2 meals on saturday, breakfast and dinner. rest of the days was just breakfast.


month 4-6.

same as month 3, only i induce vomiting after weekend binge meal so i technically didnt eat any of that.

like i said, extremely fucked up. and totally not the healthy way to go. i gained back all my weight in 2 months, with the only benefit to this whole ordeal being my fatty liver is now gone.

just in case people didnt catch it the first few times: ***seriously, dont do it.***

 i did it because i was sick in the head, so to speak."
