I‚Äôve been working with tarot recently, though I‚Äôm fairly new. I haven‚Äôt worked with an archetype deck before. My eye has been on Kim Krans‚Äôs tarot deck for a while and now you‚Äôre making me want this one, too! Do you use tarot, too?

I love the three cards you drew. Your interpretation sounds so spot on. I am particularly thinking of the heart as a space. I am pagan, solitary witch, and my child goes to a Christian parents-day-out. (Bible Belt living!) He has talked before, parroting his teachers, about Jesus living in our hearts. We have some deep conversations for a young child. And I absolutely think the heart is a place, and I absolutely think it is deeper than we know. Possibly it‚Äôs a portal. It‚Äôs definitely a source of love, a space of infinite compassion. I‚Äôm going to think on this more. I really want that archetype deck now!"
