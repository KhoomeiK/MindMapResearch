gaming,ff2avzl,t3_er7w69,1579499082.0,"I'm probably going to have to go with the game that I enjoyed for most of my childhood which was Smash Bros Melee for the Game cube. I didn't have any friends to play with (sadness I know but oh well) so I would play with my brother. My favorite was princess peach and I would usually use the Daisy skin theme because my normal choice (blue) wasn't a blue I liked. My brother played kirby and young link and would insist on playing on hyrule castle... he would run away forever but it was fun to play in the bottom of the castle because of how much we would bounce off the walls. We were young and without interent so we weren't aware of the competitive nature of the game and I didn't realize how strong peach was compared to kirby. The reason I chiose roach was because she was pretty. I also liked kirby and jigglypuff, had no idea her rest did anything until I accidentaly hit him with it and even did we didn't know what happened. I mean I also like roy because he was cute.luigi because he was like a poor soul who needed love(I think I used the orange skin (or am i making that up). I didn't choose zelda because,  shallow thing but I didn't liked the way she looked.... any way probably should have realized earlier I was a gay boi.(not saying bother choosing the ""feminine"" or ""girly"" characters is gay but I choose them because even at that age I could stan a queen.
The disk was scratched so It wouldn't let us play that many things just the vs mode really not the missions,story, or adventure mode because it would stop working. Which means that we only got characters because we would play the rounds required to get them. I remember getting game and watch several years later and being so excited.( our original memory stick was lost so all the games we had done were lost so it took a little longer than it should have. But it was fun even just playing against each other 

Honorable missions from the gamecube which I played 
1. Super Mario  Sunshine 
2. Sonic heroes
3. Madagascar 
4. Star fox (adventures?  The one with dinos)
5. Shrek 2"

AskReddit,fdvw0ze,t3_en7iyp,1578752254.0,"My math teacher
She was the head of the math department at my high school taught both AP Calc AB and BC.
She was really devoted to her students. It was the AP class (and in math which now that I'm in college finally understand why everyone hates math) so it was only a small portion of students. She even stayed a year apart from her husband just to see is graduate. She was one smart lady. That's not to say the other teachers weren't great because I was lucky enough to have a pretty decent group of teachers but she was just top notch. The ap teachers would offer tutoring sessions sometimes on weekends as the tests started to come up but she would even offer them on breaks. And she would give is food. And she made an amazing change for her own health. She lost so much weight over break (it was probably gradual but the difference over winter break surprised everyone)with Workouts and diets. Now she left to move with her husband and I don't know what my high school will do without her."
