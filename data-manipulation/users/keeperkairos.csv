You can tell by the fact that they almost never replay to anyone and from their general post history. Also they often repost stuff on different subs.
DotA2,ff6es1h,t1_ff6df24,1579625621.0,You highly over value damage in a support hero. Maxing glimpse will actually lead to more kills but a slower Aghs. The Aghs is what’s important.
