He sold most of his decks to the owner though, so he mostly plays those. That's definitely not the norm, but most play groups have spare decks (and they always want a 4th player for the pod lol)."

Eyebleach,fed0ugm,t1_fecr8s1,1578993030.0,"Because koalas evolved to be the stupidest animals in existence. Let me explain: 

First, their diet. They eat eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic and fibrous, basically meaning it should kill you when you eat it, and even if it doesn't kill you, it would take the rest of your life just to finish digesting it. But this is the only thing they eat, so they end up spending all their energy to digest it, meaning that...

Number two, they sleep. Always. If they're not eating or shitting themselves, they're sleeping. You thought sloths were lazy? An animal named after its laziness is a fucking chihuahua hyped up on cocaine in comparison to a koala. 

However, another problem with this eucalyptus diet is it means their brains are tiny. You could pick up a rock in your backyard and find more intelligent life crawling on its underside than you could in a room full of koalas. They eat eucalyptus, so why not give them a hand by giving them a fucking eucalyptus salad for them to eat so they don't have to spend half their waking hours slowly ripping leaves off? Good luck with that. These motherfuckers are so stupid they wouldn't understand that it's food. And speaking of motherfuckers. 

Oh my god these animals are horny. If a male koala sees another koala, he'll make his way towards her. Then if he somehow manages to make it to her, he'll then proceed to rape her, and in all likelihood fall out of the tree. Which is why they have such tiny brains. They've got a built in helmet for their skulls so that the little bit of brain they do have doesn't fucking smash into pulp when one of them gets horny. That horny nature of theirs isn't just tossing them out of trees though. Perhaps it's what they're most infamous for: 

Chlamydia. These koalas fuck so much they managed to spread chlamydia across nearly their entire population. It's no wonder they're dying. They're all sick, passing it on to their babies, and they're too brainless to do shit about it. 

And now their house is on fire. Imagine your house caught fire in the middle of the night while you're sleeping. You wake up, see the fire, and run outside, making sure your family is safe. It's toast. The place is burnt to the ground. You can see where the kitchen was, and a little bit of where you were sleeping, but the rest is indistinguishable. Now imagine that it's not just your house. It's also your neighbor's house, and the house after that, and the one after that. In fact, it's the whole neighborhood. Then you realize that it's your entire town, and everything beyond. All burned up and gone. Koalas already had the short end of the stick in genes, but now the tiny little bit of stick is literally burning away. 

So let's help the poor suckers out. Savethekoala.com will tell you more about their predicament (in a much more professional manner) and give you the opportunity to donate to their cause, and even adopt your own koala, where they'll send you a cute koala stuffed animal and pictures of one of the koalas your donation helped save. 

And if you don't care for the koalas (I mean they weren't exactly helping themselves), but don't want to watch the world burn, I'll direct you to this article from USAToday that has links for donations to all the different organizations working together to fight the fires: https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/2832145001"

PioneerMTG,fczs8jo,t3_ejpwai,1578107737.0,"At first glance I notice two things: 

1. You don't need 4 fabled passage and 4 evolving wilds. 4 fabled passage is enough. The synergy with Gitrog is amazing, but you need some lands to come in untapped, and with crucible of worlds and ramunap excavator you only need to see one of them to get value. Which brings me to point 2...

2. 4 total of crucible of worlds effects might be right, but do you want that effect on a creature or artifact? I think having two of each would be a mistake, and am inclined to think that the body is more valuable than the evasion granted by crucible. As a small bonus, excavator also adds 1 devotion to green.



Edit: I'll add one more thing: 

3. Utility lands are great, but (unless I'm missing something) having a bunch of 1-ofs for lands you can't search for isn't that great. Figure out which ones you want or run [[Elvish Reclaimer]] to give yourself access to the toolbox in the mana base.

Unless you jacked off to yourself. If you find yourself sexy enough to get yourself hard (or horny) and then masturbate to that, is that considered prideful, and therefore still sinful?

Idk. Masturbation is always condemned today because it (generally) implies porn/lust, but is masturbation itself inherently sinful (like in my hypothetical)?"
