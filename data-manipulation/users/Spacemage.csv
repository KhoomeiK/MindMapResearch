trashy,ffbsvmw,t1_ffb46i7,1579781505.0,"Something to keep in mind. You're 24, so you're pretty much around the peak health of your natural life. Certainly you can modify that with diet and exercise, and habitual lifestyle regiments, but without any if those things seriously in place, you've peaked.

From that age going forward the stress you put on your body is going to start taking a toll. You might notice it, and if you do you'll likely dismiss it as stress, anxiety, tired, overowkrd, X, Y, Z, etc. Then it keeps happening, and you become accustomed to it.

Then you start noticing things failing. But at this point, between booze and what ever you're smoking, you don't care because otherwise you feel fine. That's when you're going to realize you're in a bad spot, but it's so hard by the time you've been doing this for another (fast) 6 years, that even if you want to you won't be able to without seriously over hauling your life style. And that's hard. Especially when you're addicted to shit like alcohol.

I've been in your shoes before. I've been doing the full time work and full time school thing for the past 5 years. I just turned 33, this will be my second degree. I fucked off drinking and playing video games the first time when I was 19, and it was all a waste of time.

I haven't drank in almost 2 years now, and I feel significantly better than I used to. I really only stopped because I couldnt handle my workload any longer if I was drinking.

Stop justifying when you're drinking and find ways to stop doing it. It's cool if you can handle it, but if you have to drink because you're stressed out then you can't handle it. Stress is a slippery slope. Some days are really hard, but when you've influenced your brain, and the gradient if stress becomes blurred, driving home might be slightly more stressful than normal one day and that equals a drink. But that drink used to only be reserved for having a full day at work and school with tests and shitty interactions all day. Those two stresses are not the same, but you end up treating them that way. That's when you're going to be in ""fuckedsville"".

So yeah, while you shouldn't quit cold turkey if you're dependent. You're not at that point yet. I would take some time off from drinking and seriously look at how you feel and how you function without it.

Sorry this is so long. There's so much to say. If you need to talk feel free to message me. I know what you're going through, and it sucks. It always does and will, but you're not alone. Good luck brother. Love ya.

TL:DR; alcohol abuse is easy to justify and get caught up in. Message me if you need to talk, I've been there and dealing with it now."

AskReddit,ff839rq,t3_erx7jt,1579664832.0,"Drive less, eat less meat, buy less plastic containers.

Driving is one of the biggest issues Americans have, which is relatively easy to curb. Joy rides, not necessary. If you're going out multiple times a day for something, combine your trip and plan it out so you can hit stops in the most logical order.

Also get maintenance done on your vehicle. If it's got suboptimal gas mileage you're not only spending more money, but you're burning more fuel that will never be replaced.

Eating less meat is the biggest, but it's tough for people to stop. So instead of stopping, eat half as much as you normally do per week. If you eat meat 6 days a week, cut it down to 3. That's reducing the footprint by 50%. While a single person's 50% is not a whole lot, if everyone did that, it would be more impactful than anything else a group of people could possibly do.

But keep in mind, even small things add up, so even if you are 1/20 of people eating 50% of your average meat, then you're still Making a change.

Another is reducing the amount of packaged food/drink, and objects you buy. If you don't need it in a package, don't get it.

Go out to eat? Bring your own container for left overs."

AskReddit,fewiu7u,t1_feue7k8,1579411417.0,"I want to add an ""almost kidnapped"" story, becsuse it has a big difference from all the others.

My best friend lived nextdoor to my parents. At the time, I was probably 17 at the oldest. He's 8 years younger than me, his sister is five years older than him, and his brother is 4 years younger than him. One summer day we were hanging out at his house, outside, playing tag. He and I were on his porch, and there were probably 5 or 6 other kids with us.

His sister and brother were a house-yard away, at the corner of our block. There are 6 houses on each side of the blocks. They were near the first house, his house is the second on the block. I say that to point out how close we all were to his brother and sister, and how dense our neighborhood is.

A van pulls up to the two of the and starts talking to her. She quickly starts heading back to the house and tells all of us that she thinks the person in the vehicle was trying to kidnap them. I think they wanted her and her brother to help them look for something, or get closer to the vehicle - typical kidnapper shit.

Within a day or two there were reports that a van looking identical to the one we saw had either tried or did kidnap someone.

I tell this story because there were witnesses, in a populated and relatively busy neighbor, yet a 14 and 5 year old kid almost got kidnapped. You seriously cannot put it passed people to do fucked up things, even in situations where no logical or rational person would commit those crimes."

It was a big, white farm house with visible basement windows at the bottom.

AskReddit,fewagu6,t3_eqies2,1579407554.0,"I was laying with my girlfriend in her old bed at her parents house. Her dad was in the living room a few yards from the room playing guitar. Everyone else was asleep. The room was dark, it was late at night. Both of us were completely sober.

We were talking to each other at a normal, night time level. Next to her in a nightstand was a three-in-one radio, with a radio, tape deck, and CD player. In the middle of our conversation we heard a man's voice, that sounded like one of the radio announcers or a private eye from the 30s - think ""you'll never make it in the city without me, see!"" sort of voice.

That's about the length of what we heard.

When we noticed it, we stopped talking, but by the time we could react it was done too. We listened for a second, but nothing else happened.

I got up and checked the radio. Either the tape door or the CD door was broken and always open, and neither had anything in them. It wasn't set to radio if I remember correctly. The real kicker though; the entire unit was not plugged in. There was no way it could have played anything.

It wasn't her dad, because we could still hear him playing music. It wasn't her mom, because she was asleep and absolutely was not the type of person to play a prank.

To this day, we still have no idea. I wondered if it was maybe some weird electrical interference, but I don't know how that would work.

Also a couple months later, her son was sleeping in her bed room alone at the time, probably at the age of 4 or 5. Woke up crying, I went in from the living room to check on him. The cordless phone, mounted on the wall, was going off. It was the ""find phone"" alarm. I took it off the wall and it stopped.

IWantToLearn,femy7ny,t3_epxjqu,1579272668.0,"I tell people this all the time. As a first step to getting out of your introvert shell.

Talk to cashiers. It's the perfect place to make small talk because you only interact for a very short period of time and gives you a lot of good examples of reading people. If you ask someone how their day is going you will get a variety of answers.

Some people will be polite and say fine, and stop talking. It's because their day sucks and they don't want to talk about it.

Others will tell you it's rough, and you can have a conversation, or you can listen, you can make them feel better, etc.

Some people will tell you their day is going fine and start talking to you about other sfuff.

Theres obviously more scenarios, but these little interactions really make it easier to talk to anyone. Granted it doesn't make it EASY to talk to people, but it helps move in that direction. One of the reasons is because you get the experience with people who don't really have a choice but to interact with you. As long as you're not doing this to unload your thoughts and shitty day/drama on them, you're all set.

This helped me immensely over the years as someone who was shy, introverted, socially awkward, and didn't like interacting with people. Over the first few months of doing this I definitely improved leagues in all those areas.

Edited: to add, these situations give you the opportunity to change how you approach opening a conversation to determine what works and doesn't, especially if you come across the same cashier frequently."
