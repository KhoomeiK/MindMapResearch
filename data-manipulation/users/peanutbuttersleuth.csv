24 days paid vacation - goes up over time.  I think I’m at 30 days starting in 2021.

Travel benefits - only pay taxes for flights taken on own time.  Travel for work and get per diems anytime you’re away.

AskReddit,fc1vm55,t3_efaqo0,1577331110.0,"Girl, mid-20s, walks to the back mid-takeoff to go to the lav, and when sheâ€™s told to sit back down, says sheâ€™s gotta go.  Squats outside the lavatory door and pees.

Since weâ€™re still very much climbing, her pee runs across the floor onto the other FAs feet.  When I talk to her to see if sheâ€™s drunk or sick (do we need to turn the plane around/how serious is this?) she asks â€œdoes this happen to people a lot?â€

Literally no like what??  Then she didnâ€™t want to take gravol or any meds we had to help her nausea because she wanted to drink on the flight, which I actually accidentally laughed in her face and said â€œyouâ€™re not drinking.â€

Turn to get her water, turn back and sheâ€™s gone.  Sheâ€™s gone back to her seat.  But she hadnâ€™t pulled down her pants to go pee, so she was sitting in her pee pants for the next 6 hours..."
