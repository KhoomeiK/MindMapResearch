They don't care about messing up the economy of the UK, they just want to make an example to keep their extremely high paid jobs.

That's just the feeling I get from this statement, not that's it's true. I agree with you that it's unhelpful and dangerous. The best thing to do would be to leave the harsh words behind and try to get along."

todayilearned,fde5abw,t1_fddywlv,1578331489.0,"Fire is the most common natural disturbance of the boreal forest. Historically, on average, every square meter burned approximately every 20 to 50 years. 

Scots pine is the most common tree species in finland, and it has adapted to this environment with high crowns and thick bark protecting the tree from the flames.

The forest fires here are usually ground fires and not nearly as destructive as the crown fires seen in Australia."
todayilearned,fde4gyh,t1_fddzy0z,1578330973.0,"I'm not sure if I would call thinning a type of harvesting in the context of regeneration, since regeneration is normally only made after final felling.

The forests managed for production can be thinned thrice before final felling. That would start when the stand reaches an age around 20-35 years. This is supported by the site you linked. It seems to me that these recommendations are for southern Finland.  I'm from northern Sweden and here thinning operations are normally made when the trees are around 45-60 years old. If no cleaning has been made you might want to wait even longer. Cleaning is something that is strongly recommended by most if you want to have good economy, but it's also often skipped (https://www.atl.nu/skog/slarv-med-rojningen-straffar-sig/). 

In my region the average tree in final felling is around 100 years old. In my local vicinity it's around 140 years. I know that Finland has a bit lower averages but trees more than a century old in a final felling can't be uncommon."
todayilearned,fddy7bx,t1_fddqzvx,1578326852.0,"Not every couple of decades. I would say at least six decades before harvest, in northern Finland, more like 10 to 15. Forest grows really slow on these latitudes."

Om  jag tjänar 5 000 per månad så är den sista hundringen jag tjänat viktigare för min ekonomi än om jag tjänar 50 000 per månad."
