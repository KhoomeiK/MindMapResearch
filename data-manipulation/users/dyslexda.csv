At the end of the day it's entertainment, not the Olympics. The onside kick has existed since the early 20s, well before modern TV contracts.

* 2: Basically the same as above, just trying to recreate it. This was probably the best beer I ever brewed. No banana off flavor, just crisp and delicious. 

* 3: The recipe was maybe a little *too* crisp, so I dialed back the pilsner and went for 55% Pilsner, 32% 2 Row, 8% Vienna, and 5% Wheat. I was not a fan, to be honest; lost the foundation of what makes a ""Kolsch"" to me. Also, the dreaded banana off flavor was back, and to great effect. It was almost a dumper, to be honest. I had tried fermenting super cold (59F, IIRC) because of what I'd seen others reporting online, but if anything that just ended up stressing the yeast even more. 

* 4: Went to 87% Pilsner, 8% Munich, and 5% Wheat. Fermented slightly warmer, and the big change I made was finally oxygenating (previously I just splashed, but I got a Blichmann inline kit). Much better, though still had a slight banana off flavor. At this point I basically gave up on WLP029.

* 5: This was a weird one. Went to 90% Pilsner, 5% Wheat, and 5% Biscuit. Unfortunately my LHBS screwed up my grain order and put some kind of crystal malt in instead of the Biscuit. I also took this time to ferment with a Kveik strain I was playing around with. It came out...decent. Didn't taste like a Kolsch, obviously (and I didn't really expect it to), but it wasn't bad.

If I think there is one glaring design flaw in 5E, it's that every class is balanced around this idea. Full casters are given enough resources to get through ~6-8 medium or hard encounters per day, while short rest characters like Monks and Warlocks are given the resources to get through ~2-3 at a time before taking a short rest. However, basically every poll I've ever seen (like [this one](https://twitter.com/mattcolville/status/896458473688268801?lang=en) from Colville) suggest that the vast majority of groups are only doing a couple combats per day, and I can guarantee those groups aren't supplementing one combat with five or six equally draining non-combat encounters. Thus, WotC balanced the system around a playstyle most groups will never see."
DMAcademy,fenxuph,t1_fenphvw,1579292447.0,"The guidelines are there to exhaust player resources over the course of the day. If you only have one or two encounters, you won't be anywhere close to exhausting resources, which significantly throws off class balance (of *course* the Wizard seems OP if they can blow all their spells in one fight, whereas the Warlock's two spells seems wimpy in comparison)."
nfl,fen6xho,t1_fen5puc,1579278312.0,"Four months ago the common joke was ""Tank for Tua."" Suddenly everyone thinks Burrow is the next coming of Peyton Manning. This happens nearly every year, where the top QB will be a guaranteed hit, or we have the best RB prospect since Adrian Peterson. See it happen enough, and you start yawning. The last ""guaranteed hit"" to pan out was Luck (and let's be real, how'd that turn out?). The last top pick to do it was Newton. 

If a team *truly* believes Burrow will be head-and-shoulders above their current QB, then sure, you go get him. But neither Jones nor Haskins looked bad, and being able to sell the pick for two firsts and a third might do wonders for the right program."

Favre's mystique was as an iron man, someone that would take a hit and keep going no matter what. All through high school and college he'd take hits, have his head bounce on the turf, lay his body out for a block, etc, and those take a toll. In the interview posted in another comment here, he describes a game where a defender hit him and pushed him to the ground. Not a tackle, and totally legal. However, when he hit the ground, his head bounced hard, and he saw stars. We now know that means a concussion, but 20 years ago that was just normal, and he was taking that kind of abuse every game."

This is actually something I noticed about Davante Adams, and really saw it in the Seahawks game. He'll fight for yards when he's got a chance, but if he sees he's got the first down and is about to be blown up, he'll just give himself up. I really respect that he's able to do that, because it keeps him on the field longer. I haven't watched as much Fitz, but if he's doing the same, that explains his longevity."
