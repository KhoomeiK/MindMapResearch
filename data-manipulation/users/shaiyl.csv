Also I'm a software engineer and team lead, and we encourage our developers all the time to take udemy classes and other sorts of things like that, because its the sort of job where to succeed you need to always be learning and then applying that learning to your work.

Learn, with whatever methods it takes to do it. That's the most important thing."

AskReddit,ffjm157,t1_ffj5evm,1580001349.0,"I've been in software as a self-taught person for about 10 years now, and it seems like the most important thing to enjoy it is to enjoy working with other people, and having good problem solving skills, and actually enjoying solving problems and improving your skillset (you have to keep up with technology as it changes). It's also important to know when to walk away from a problem for a few hours and not let yourself get burnt out.

Almost everyone in the industry suffers from some form of impostor syndrome, which is interesting once you've been there a while, paired up with some people you consider amazing engineers, and they struggle with the same stuff you do.

You will sit at a desk a long time during the day,  but as someone who has had 2 careers (I started as a graphic designer and did that for about 6 years), I can tell you the day goes by much faster for me sitting at a desk coding than doing design or some of the other things I could be doing. I also manage my mental load, I know I can't actually write good code that works for more than 6 hours a day, so I don't, I fill up the rest of my time trying to learn and communicate with my team.

Soft skills are more important than you would think in software: you \_need\_ to be able to work well with others to succeed, and not get into the mentality that some people have where its just nerds arguing about code angrily all day. It doesn't have to be like that, and it is a lot more fun if you can work well with the other devs, the product owners, the graphic designers, etc."

You are meant to write down your distorted thoughts (or the situation that causes them, and then the thoughts) and then you figure out what kind of distortion it is (all or nothing, personalization, labeling, etc) and refute it as best you can using logic.

It works great, but the hard part is keeping it up for a long period of time, especially once you start to feel better. You also can't really do them in your head, you have to write them down.

He really didn't like it, but he's a kid, so in her mind I guess it wasn't real or important enough to respect.

I never could figure it out because my mom is kind of sneaky. She never outright does mean things, she's more passive-aggressive and will say stuff that either seems nice, or has two sides to it. Her favorite comments about my husband aren't ever outright mean, but they are usually stuff that implies she thinks something is wrong with him, or she'll try and get me to diagnose him with some kind of disease. I don't know how to tell her that half the reason he never comes with me to visit is because he can't stand her. I think it was easier for him to detect her nastiness because he didn't grow up with it.

My family was more of the 'if you get a B you messed up, if you get an A+ that's expected and status quo.' I can't really remember how things went for me, other than a general lack of any kind of notice of acknowledgement of my achievements. It was just expected that I would get perfect marks and always be the best, and I was going to be made to feel guilty if I didn't do that.

I decided myself it was time to set boundaries. If my mom wants something from me that I don't want to do (recent example was she wanted me to fly down to see them when my ferry got cancelled, knowing full well I have flying issues) and no amount of explaining was going to make her happy that I chose not to do it. So, she didn't get an explanation. I just said ""No. I will drive down tomorrow."" That's all she got, it's all she deserves, because she will use guilt against me as a weapon even when I have no control over things like the weather, and because she has never treated my anxiety as more than anything but an inconvenience to her, rather than this serious, obnoxious disease I've had to spend years working on, she doesn't get to argue with me anymore about what I choose to do or not do."

quityourbullshit,fcvx2ld,t1_fcvtb64,1578012057.0,"LOL that's not what I said at all. I said if you practice for literally thousands of hours at drawing, you will get really good. If you draw without practicing, you are not an artist. You are a person trying to learn.

You clearly don't understand this because you haven't done it. Go ask the thousands of excellent artists out there in games and movies and, while they may not be fucking leonardo davinci, they will all tell you that they worked hard and practiced their asses off to get there, and they will resent your statements about some innate talent that is necessary to do what they've done. It's actively detrimental to aspiring artists to make these kinds of statements. Part of art education is educating people to undertstand that practice is mandatory and necessary. You can't get by on raw talent and no practice, but someone without innate talent can ABSOLUTELY become a successful artist with enough hard work and practice. I promise you this is true, I've seen it.

Edit: I can't even tell you how many hours I've spent practicing, and I'm not even really a professional. I kept track of a couple of years of daily practice that adds up to about 50 man-days of work, which is about 1200 hours, but that's only the time I tracked specifically during a two year 'streak' that I did. I'm pretty sure with all the other years besides those two added in I have logged at least 5000-6000 hours of pure drawing practice, and that is low compared to someone who does 6+ hours or more daily. The difference in quality over those two years of practice was staggering, though. I can imagine with many thousands more hours I could get much better."
quityourbullshit,fcvhi45,t1_fcue7pa,1578002198.0,"You are wrong. You can practice yourself into being a master. Talent is just a jumping off point, and often only means you'll be more interested in it as a kid because you're slightly better at it early on than your peers.

I don't think I can convince you otherwise, as you appear set in your ways, but since I've spent years of my life doing the task of drawing, and I have a degree in art, I'm going to simply state that I firmly believe know more than you on this subject, because I have 20 years of experience in this field. I've done it, I've felt it, I've MET fantastic artists who all say the same thing: it's the practice and the work, talent just makes it easier. Not everyone is going to be DaVinci,  but plenty of people can make a career out of art and be successful and have people call them a 'master'. Not getting to the absolute pinnacle of a craft does not a failure make.

You can believe whatever you like, but I'm stating right now that I strongly feel I know more about this subject than you do, and that you should reconsider your viewpoint, and even take up drawing and practice it for a few months to see what it feels like to practice and get better at this skill.

Nope, its ESSENTIAL. You must use them and never stop using them,  because they are key to being good. I am actually uncomfortable and unable to draw these days without a full suite of references and research images because my work is crap without them."
quityourbullshit,fcur6k0,t1_fculihc,1577986835.0,"it drives me nuts. I spent two years straight drawing every single day for at least 30 minutes (usually way more) to get better. I kept track of the streak, even, well over 700 straight days, in addition to all the years before and after that of time I've spent. I saw my skills improve exponentially, I understand by doing that just what the value of practice is to learn the skill of drawing, and every time someone dismisses that I get kind of annoyed. I worked so hard, for \_years\_ to get where I am today"
quityourbullshit,fcujsxp,t1_fcu8x0u,1577982617.0,"You already have a bunch of people trying to refute you, but as someone who has put literally thousands of hours into learning to draw well, thank you. It's not god given, its just something I've worked my ass off to learn, and it pisses me off when people dismiss all of that."
quityourbullshit,fcujndb,t1_fcue7pa,1577982516.0,"You say that but its a fallacy to assume that the 'good' artists are the ones who don't replicate. All of the good artists use references for everything they do. If I had understood this when I was younger I wouldn't have been held back so long in my art education. I needed to approach it as a skill to learn, but the idea that its some god given talent held me back for too long. I need to treat it like learning a musical instrument, not some magical formula I'd be born with.

You must practice to be a good artist. There aren't any good artists who don't practice and who don't heavily and extensively use references to create their work (unless they are doing something abstract, but they also taught us in art school that you shouldn't create abstract work without the core skill foundations to render things effectively)"
quityourbullshit,fcujh2k,t1_fcuhijb,1577982400.0,"This isn't true. It really, really isn't. I'm a person who has sat down and spent the time required to get good at drawing.

The reason why artists are always so pissed off at this 'god given talent' thing is because every artist has the absolute pieces of trash they produced before they put in the thousands and thousands of hours of practice and watched themselves get better.

The only thing talent does is help that process go faster, but no amount of talent will make up for the enormous amount of raw practice necessary to become good at drawing."

No one appreciates another person's input into their sex life, and because of the parent-child power dynamic at play here, as well as the religious aspect, you face a very uphill battle.

I realize you are concerned about your family's finances. I think that is admirable, but its also not all on you to fix this. The hardest part about transitioning from childhood to adulthood is realizing that your parents aren't perfect, and that they have their own lives separate from yours. If you have the means to help them and support them, you can, but it's always your choice, and if you don't have the means, then you shouldn't do it.  You have to live your life, without stretching yourself too thin to fix others.

Your parents made this problem, and just like every problem you'll encounter as you transition into adult life, it's going to be on the adult who made the problem to fix it. 

You can attempt to have this conversation, but I doubt it will work. Beyond that, you can contribute money or call CPS if things get especially bad."

relationship_advice,fcnl16a,t3_ei54p1,1577813582.0,"I will say that his statement 'you are always sad' is what's called an 'all - or - nothing' type of cognitive distortion. I'm not sure if you've done any CBT for your depression, but its likely you are  now also questioning whether or not you 'always' do this. Its the type of thought that is tailor-made to fit into depression and isn't helpful.

I'm not saying it his responsiblity to not say these things, but you can also recognize what he's said and how you're thinking it back to yourself as being illogical. Of course you aren't 'always' sad. But you do have depression, which means that you're going to be sad sometimes, and that's ok. Depression is a process to fix, and takes a lot of work, and that's ok.

I just want to regulate these cameras and other recording devices that can be put into a child's bedroom and post to the cloud, and create a very innocent victim very quickly when misused by a moron. If I was making software that I knew would be running in that situation, you can damn well believe I'd start looking for as many edge cases as I could before I felt comfortable releasing it. I do not make that kind of software, thank fucking god. We can still certainly ruin an entire company's business when we make bugs, but I don't have THAT to worry about.

The way I would solve this problem for Amazon would not be popular with their product owners or executives: I would insist that all users are required to use 2fa, and that we would enforce very stringent password requirements on top of that.

If you can understand where I'm coming from: I do not think all things should be bubble wrapped. I have written my fair share of bugs that had to be patched out.

I am a software developer, and fight against this kind of shit all the time at my job. Spend the extra few thousand and put in the fucking right kind of code.

If you want to use a real world analogy, then fine. Let's talk about regulations inside of electronics. When electrical devices first came out, they were dangerous as FUCK because companies didn't have to do things like insulate live wires, and consumers were expected to 'just be careful' with these objects. 

Companies will not self regulate. And this is an issue that is absolutely endemic to the software industry. Often these bugs do not matter, but I would argue that cameras that film shit, no matter where they are, should be held to a higher standard of software development than some candy crush ass app.
