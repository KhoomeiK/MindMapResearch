Astronomy,ffh4exx,t1_ffffomw,1579922821.0,"I think being able to do this is so cool. Is there any way you would be interested in indulging the curiosity of someone who is not at all familiar with this hobby? About how much does the equipment you use cost? I saw some other comments about ""walking noise"" and ""dithering"" and other really cool/nonsense sounding jargon, what is up with that stuff? What does the process of taking 6 hours worth of images look like in terms of what you are doing? Are you sitting out there, sipping coffee from a thermos cup, clicking photos every few seconds? Or, is it more of a set-it-and-forget-it type situation? 


Feel free to just ignore this. I understand it might be instrusive, or you may just be uninterested in answering questions, and that is totally fine. I really like your picture."

DoesAnybodyElse,ffammnw,t1_ff990k4,1579739507.0,"So true. Having people skills doesn't make you a sociopath, though. Really, I think it just makes you a good person. Striving to have a positive and pleasant interaction with someone without regard to your opinions and feelings toward them is a really noble and genuine thing to do.
