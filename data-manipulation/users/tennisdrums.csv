There are those that think gluten-free is some sort of dieting trick. It kind of works, but really only through proxy. A gluten heavy diet means you're probably eating a lot of calorie-rich carbohydrates: pizza, pasta, bread and the like. A smart ""gluten-free"" diet just means that you're avoiding processed carbs and eating more fresh fruits and vegetables. A dumb ""gluten free"" diet means you're eating even more heavily processed foods that try to compensate for their shitty taste or texture by packing in more unhealthy shit. It was never the gluten either way, it was really a question of cutting out heavy carbs and replacing it with either better, or worse alternatives.

The other one that's frustrating is that ever since this ""gluten-free"" fad started, suddenly everyone's diagnosing themselves with a ""gluten allergy"" or ""gluten sensitivity"", outside of any question of weight gain or loss.
