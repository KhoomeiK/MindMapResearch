facepalm,fcl0v71,t1_fckx434,1577737378.0,My dad has a reverse osmosis that he runs the tap water through. It usually brings the ppm down to 150 or so and it tastes so much cleaner.
facepalm,fckofkd,t1_fcknedp,1577729732.0,"So, I grew up in a Rural Water District (RWD) area and it's kind of an open secret that they rig the water quality testing. Some folks have done some third party testing and the report the RWD publishes every year always severely under represents the quality of the water. My dad has a total dissolved solids (TDS) reader, which normally puts out local RWD water supply around 800-1000 parts per million and it should be closer to 300-500 and is usually reported around that. Granted, it's still technically safe for drinking up to 1200 ppm, but the water here truly does taste like garbage and is overchlorinated to make up for the excessive TDS."
