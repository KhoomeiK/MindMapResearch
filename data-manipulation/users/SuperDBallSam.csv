witcher,ferily4,t1_fenc66p,1579354345.0,I like the actress that plays Triss too. People reacted negatively because she's not the Triss we expected (game Triss).  But I suspect if you read the books first (I did not) game Triss wouldn't have met expectations either.
AskReddit,fer6mtc,t1_fene8o9,1579350513.0,"It's the most skippable part of any attraction, the gift shop, over and over, unattached to an actual attraction."
GreenBayPackers,feqtxa8,t1_feobx45,1579345987.0,I think Jones has improved with his blitz pickups and we can use Marcedes to slow down or neutralize a rusher and possibly contribute a couple 8 yard safety valve catches.
GreenBayPackers,feqm7yd,t3_eq5zee,1579343539.0,Man it's awesome to watch an actual team again instead of Aaron Rodgers and a bunch of dudes. GPG!
AskReddit,feqdvbt,t3_eq9k9o,1579340634.0,"Bob Dylan at Bonnaroo in maybe '04.  But since many have already said him, I'll give honorable mention to his son Jakob with the Wallflowers. Dude couldn't even be bothered to sing One Headlight (their one and only hit).  He stuck the microphone out and made us sing it."

GreenBayPackers,feewype,t1_feelywj,1579043019.0,"Even if they don't give possession, we still should've kept our timeout. We technically won that challenge."
GreenBayPackers,fec2tuk,t1_fead0le,1578965844.0,Right?  100% more than zero is still zero.  (But yes I understand the point.)
funny,febnpyl,t1_febnfn1,1578960784.0,Feels more like giving than getting.
witcher,feay65b,t1_fe9lbuq,1578953438.0,I want a game where we get to play as Letho.  I haven't thought this through but I really want a game centered around Letho.
GreenBayPackers,fe98nzt,t1_fe93k8l,1578935398.0,"Not only that, they took away a timeout due to ""losing"" the challenge.  But we didn't lose the challenge. We challenged the ruling on the field of down by contact. It was then ruled a fumble. That's a winning challenge."
GreenBayPackers,fe6d2l7,t1_fe6b5ka,1578887384.0,He deserved every bit of criticism he got. Dude showed up today though.

GreenBayPackers,fe5wejl,t1_fe5w894,1578876447.0,So do I if we're being honest.
GreenBayPackers,fe5vldi,t1_fe5va50,1578875928.0,Yep.  Even though we didn't get the ball we won the challenge. That's a huge mistake by the refs.
GreenBayPackers,fe5ud09,t1_fe5u6do,1578875142.0,That's a real good point. We challenged the call of down by contact and it was ruled a fumble.

todayilearned,fdid1va,t1_fdi7mqs,1578440142.0,I saw him open for Tool with Tomahawk. Either I wasn't well versed enough to appreciate it (I was 19) or it just...wasn't good.
whitesox,fdfdpwk,t1_fdf0t8c,1578359286.0,Benetti really does grow on you. Their chemistry noticeably improved throughout the course of the year too.
GreenBayPackers,fdfdjpb,t1_fdf61wc,1578359170.0,Cobb had a better year than literally every one of our receivers not named Davante Adams. Love to have him back on a cheap deal.
GreenBayPackers,fdchd35,t1_fdc451u,1578274926.0,It's nearly impossible to beat the 49ers at Candlestick. Especially since they don't play their games there.

witcher,fcsh2ik,t1_fcrz3dw,1577916435.0,Agreed. Once you cross the river the vibe definitely changes. It's less bleak and war ravaged. Almost like you're breathing fresh air finally after riding amongst corpses and despair for so long.
todayilearned,fcrcd7c,t1_fcr7sbn,1577899929.0,Anyone that attempts a Godfather reboot should be tried for war crimes.

GreenBayPackers,fckiu7x,t1_fckc8ix,1577726284.0,Gotcha.  I by no means thought it was a bad interception. Just didn't realize it was that close to JK's average.
GreenBayPackers,fck5pl2,t1_fcjpnr7,1577717336.0,Please explain to me how that pick on 3rd and 20 is better than a punt. Otherwise I totally agree with you.
gaming,fcfz5bm,t1_fcft5lv,1577635077.0,No.  The show is an adaptation of stories from the book series. The games are new stories (not written by Andrzej Sapkowski) based on his world and characters.

dubuque,fc4l1bi,t3_eg4qbh,1577419790.0,"I'm not saying this as a certified tour guide or anything....

But start at Monks on Bluff street for coffee.  They themselves have a decent nightlife/live music scene. The owners, Trish and Kasey, are excellent people and pretty good ambassadors for the downtown area.   It's a good jumping off point.  

A few of my favorites downtown (Main Street/Millwork District):

Quality beer/burger:  Lot One

Dive bar beer/burger:  Pauls

Live Music:  The Lift

Nice dinner:  Brazen, L'May, or Pepper Sprout

Wine Bar:   The Wicked Dame"
