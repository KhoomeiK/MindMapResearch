knitting,ff4eti4,t1_ff4cqk9,1579561911.0,I’m not sure but I know that I just stick over it and keep going if I can’t back out the other stitches!  I am knitting pouches for Australian animals and figured out 4” into the project that US size 4 needles are NOT. Size 4 in AU.  They are size 6! 🤦🏼‍♀️. I pulled it all out😩

knitting,ff4btc9,t3_erksb1,1579559934.0,"Depending how far you went past that loop, you may be able to unstitched the other loops to the left of it and then net that mistake and then keep going forward. If that makes sense as well but to save yourself some frustration it may make more sense to just finish the row turn your work around, and net back through that one as if it’s OK"
knitting,ff4bpm9,t3_erksb1,1579559869.0,But this looks like you can just knit that loop and keep got. I do not see anything that is loose.
knitting,ff4bn4h,t3_erksb1,1579559825.0,"Hey I get it! So, what I meant was finished knitting across that row to the end and finish the row. Then turn your work around and start to go back the other way. When you get to that little hiccup, just need it like all the other loops and just keep going. I’ve done that where I’ve made that mistake and I just need straight through as if it’s not an accident. If you do drop a stitch several layers down, I use a crochet hook to pull it through and bring it back up to where it should be on the wire."
knitting,ff4aokq,t3_erksb1,1579559217.0,It looks like you may have. It’s some sort a hiccup and I’m not quite sure how you can fix it either! When I have a tiny mistake like that I just need through it like a regular link on the row on the way back. Does that make sense? Are usually find that it’s days in and it doesn’t make my project fall apart later if I just leave it back in through.

todayilearned,fegjcgj,t1_fefnh12,1579094543.0,If you had watched Freaks you would know that he was treated the same way as in this story. My point was how he was treated has been typical for persons with disabilities. Read the actual words.
todayilearned,fedk8h5,t3_eol5gt,1579013614.0,"This was common behavior for persons with disabilities 100 years ago. We were usually institutionalized, or forced to live in attics or basements and never allowed to come out in public during family events or parties. Parents often just said they “lost the child “ and never talked about them. 

Watch the 1938? Film, Freaks. Hollywood honestly thought they were doing these actors a favor by hiring them for this film. 

People with disabilities were killed during Hitler’s reign because we were imperfect. 

Electric shock therapy still goes on today in some states to “control “ behavior or seizures in persons with intellectual disabilities. Our history is a dark and abusive one."
