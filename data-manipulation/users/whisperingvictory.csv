AskHistorians,feh0ras,t3_ep1czn,1579106731.0,"I think there are a number of factors at play here. First, that alcohol in smaller amounts consumed over a longer period of time (rather than binge drinking large amounts in a short period of time) will certainly affect the actual level of intoxication of the drinker. 

My expertise is not in 18th or 19th century Europe, but by way of comparison, it is believed that the prevalence of alcohol as the go to beverage in the Americas around that time (particularly the 18th century) was in part due to the fact that clean drinking water was significantly more difficult to come by. Contaminated water would have been a significant concern at the time with no practical way to test the water, and a general lack of understanding of the mechanisms by which water could be contaminated. Alcohol, in contrast, was a much safer choice. Too, its wide prevalence in the New World also meant that it was the significantly cheaper option.

I can't say for sure that there are direct parallels to Europe, but I think it's safe to assume that the risk of contaminated water played a role in the choice of alcohol over other beverages."

I think this is a tough question to answer, because you're essentially asking why the Egyptians became Egyptians, which is an incredibly nuanced question for which there is no real answer- it was a variety of sociocultural, geological, geographical, and climatological factors which coincided in a specific way. 

If what you're trying to get at is ""why didn't an agricultural civilization settle around the Colorado River?"" I'd counter with, they did. Ancestral Puebloan people (formerly called Anasazi) settled around the Colorado River. Its debated, of course, but generally believed that these civilizations were around in about the 12th Century BC. Although these people did not erect huge temples and burial sites like the Pyramids of Giza, we do have remains of stone and earth dwellings, often carved into the sides of cliff faces. They had pit homes, towers, ceremonial infrastructure, and storage complexes. They were an agrarian society and developed complex irrigation and water collection systems to deal with the general lack of precipitation in the area.
