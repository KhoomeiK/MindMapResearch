&#x200B;

The humans' coins are the standard for trade, and are known as the **Khovi** (Platinum), **Kuavi** (Gold), **Kuali** (Silver), and **Kueim**  (Copper). These are the standard coins. One Khovi equals nine Kuavi  (matching the Nine Goddesses); one Kuavi equals eighteen Kuali, and one Kuali equals 27 Kueim, severely devaluing the value of copper.

The Garou of my world trade in **Foreclaws** and **Dewclaws**, effectively equal to the human gold coin and silver coin.

The Gorumidari (Dwarves) deal in precious metals,  just like the humans do, but usually at an 80% markup and a 15%  moneychanger fee. A good rule of thumb for the Gorumidari is that if it  costs 100 Kuavi in the human lands, it will cost 180 Kuavi in the  dwarven ones, should humans be using that standard.

A dwarven gold coin is known as a **Chasm**, a silver coin is a **Cavern**, and a copper coin is a **Cave.** Because of their own inflated sense of self worth, human money is worth less than dwarf money, at a 2-to-1 conversion rate.

The Kithyiko (wereboar/kobold/gnoll crossbreed) trade in magically-irradiated copper coins and abhor silver and platinum, not even accepting it at a moneychanger unless a  party wants to get rid of dead weight. Copper coins of any sort are irradiated automatically upon entering  the Shattered Barrens and will be coated in a solid green coating of oxidation, making them weigh twice normal. 

Their copper coin is known as the **Korlac**, and because gold is very  useful in their everyday life (jewelry, shaman tools and such), they will trade one Korlac for three gold. Trade and barter otherwise will only be in Korlacs, never in gold.

The kobolds **deal in gems only,** and have a jeweler's eye to rival any  dwarf's. They are fair tradesmen and merchants, and can drive a hard  bargain when they have to. They won't take coin, as it's too loud and  jingles -- giving yourself away when you're trying to hide in the  cavernous darkness. 

The Seukothi (four armed squirrel centaurs) don't put much value in the precious metals, instead accepting **gems and works of wooden art** at a 40% profit to them. Between Seukothi, it is less profit and more ""break even."" 

The Talayaethi (Merfolk of my world) don't use gold and silver for money. They use small  colored pearls they farm in their great oyster beds. They'll accept  trade in gold and silver, but never copper. If exchanging money with humans, 1 Talayaethi Grey Pearl is equal to seven Kuali, 1 Talayaethi White Pearl is equal to two Kuavi, 1 Talayaethi Red Pearl is equal to five Kuavi and 1 Talayaethi Black Pearl equals one Khovi.

Sycanesti (medieval zootopia) only **trade in goods and services** in a ""You scratch my  fur, I scratch yours."" sort of way. They recognize the value of gold,  silver and copper, and will accept these forms of value, but coins have  far less worth than in the human or dwarven realms. You can figure  things to be about five times as expensive if paid by coin. They do not  have coins representing their own realm; to them it's all metal and  useful only for what it can be shaped into after being melted down. 

The Thortharrak (giant acid spitting lizard men from the arctic) prefer silver and platinum as both metals reflect the  bright sun and ""cold nature"" of their homeland. Their silver coins  (equal to about four Silver Kuali) are called **Frostwinds** and their platinum is known as **Icemoons**.  The Thortharrak will never trade Icemoons to outsiders but will pay  rewards if such coin is found and brought back (usually five Frostwinds per Icemoon) 

The Vamestaki (orcs) like being ""different,"" and have developed a system where they trade beveled jade cubes they call **Marks** which  are half the size of an average Vamestaki fist. One cube is usually enough for one service or item from another orc, and most common goods  will never cost more than five. The orcs understand the concept of  inflation, and the jade mines they control are carefully watched. 

For outsiders, the orcs have Ok-Ogs (ivory tokens with holes stamped in them, more holes is more value, up to 20 gold), and vials of blood to represent services owed (one vial for a small service like an hour's farmwork, or multiple hundreds from multiple sources for their loyalty to slay a dragon).

Aaaaand finally (heh), while other civilizations deal in precious metals or shiny rocks, the Volkaimolok (stone age Zootopia) will accept only **raw meat.**  One pound of raw meat is usually equal to seven human Kuali coins. It  must be fresh meat (within three days), not preserved through spices or  through magical means. They will accept metal only to make into jewelry  for status. They do not value spices as a whole and will take the ""false  tastes"" as an insult.

1) They have over-bulbous noses nearly as thick as a human's thigh, covered in tattoos and markings of both status and of lineage. To mess with a dwarf's nose is worse than messing with their beard and to actually manage to break it is a declaration of war upon the Gorumidari's family.

2) The Gorumidari tend to wear thick leathers and metals even when at rest. Everyday wear will be thick suits of (usually black) studded leather armor, complete with a leather ""face plate"" that leaves only the nose and eyes revealed. To see an on-duty warrior not wearing mirror shiny metal armor from head to toe is a rarity such that they're either getting a reprimand, or turning in their armor and being cast out in disgrace. 

3) Their previous god, the Black Man (a former paladin turned evil demon) wandered off in the last century because He ""got bored"" with puppeteering the Gorumidari. No one knows where He went, and now their divine power is fueled by the captured Sycanesti gods that their new king (King Vamathradissius) imprisoned in rose quartz pillars as if they were specimens kept in glass jars.

4) They are on the edge of an actual industrial revolution (guns and all, which they are beginning to call Blaststicks), and if it happens, the Nine Goddesses of the human lands are going to be quick to take offense since the power of science and ""reason"" would remove their power. Not just the power of the Gorumidari ""god"", but to all gods across the planet. This might start a war to end all wars...

5) One thing a dwarf will never make lightly is a promise or an oath. By unspoken tradition such a thing will never be broken... and to swear something ""on Pigbrain's Hide"" is a threat no dwarf wants to hear.

6) Gorumidari are notoriously unlucky thanks to the blood curse they picked up from their previous demon god. Saving throws have a one-in-four chance of automatically failing (1d4, fail on a 4). King Vamathradissius doesn't give an ounce of shit about the curse, completely ignoring the fact it exists."
