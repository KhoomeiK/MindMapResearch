nobuy,ffef5k3,t3_esoicl,1579845672.0,"not bad. I had one off weekend. weekends are my kryptonite but overall, i have not purchased anything that i could not eat.  My rules were never well defined. Eating out for my daughter and I is about $12 a meal, which makes it decently comparable to a homecooked dinner. I’m not allowing myself to eat out for breakfast/ lunch or snacks and I’ve stuck with that. I’ve allowed myself to grocery shop normally, but no hoarding items and the empty shelf in the pantry has to remain empty. No new clothes, no “stuff” and i have to shop my house before shopping for things I might otherwise need. That last part has been fun! Books, yoga and french lessons have replaced shopping.  I feel lighter and happier and had enough money to pay all my bills this month! 

Thank you for asking and please tell us how you are doing so far!"
MadeMeSmile,ffdkpei,t3_ess27a,1579822926.0,I hope she keeps him.
Wellthatsucks,ffdjx77,t3_eswvxj,1579822453.0,WTF this is assault!
shoppingaddiction,ffdg87b,t1_ffdagc9,1579820220.0,"Yep. You know those people who look good in a paper sack?  They all have very similar model body types.  We aren’t going to look like that if we buy that outfit.   Think about the people you think are great dressers. 

They usually are fit looking, happy and confident.   Better to put effort into being fit, happy, and confident.  Those are the best accessories for any outfit."

Children rarely make this stuff up."
LifeProTips,ffd0snn,t3_esxjom,1579811171.0,"I used to do this via text and asked very specific questions: examples: what was favorite toy? what are you most proud of? what advice  do you wish someone had given you? 

My grandma is dead now (I only ever had one grandparent). I absolutely treasure these texts. My mom does too (it was her mom).

Also, do this with your parents too!"
relationships,ffcuwmo,t1_ffctwge,1579807757.0,"It’s the typical response on reddit when people question the OP on what should be common sense issues. I misjudged you and I’m sorry. 

Good on you for listening to advice without getting defensive and for keeping your daughter safe."
relationships,ffcracl,t1_ffcp98o,1579805628.0,"Except he didn’t stop when she said stop. We teach our children about consent from a young age and tell them that anyone who doesn’t respect that is unsafe.  She may not be able to put it into words, but she has said in as many words,I don’t feel safe. Even kids should be trusted when they say that."
relationships,ffcpptt,t3_esw9v6,1579804599.0,"ps, I totally think OP will delete this post when people are calling it like it is!"
relationships,ffcpfaf,t1_ffcn7kv,1579804403.0,"I agree. Telling him pushes it into the shadows, potentially putting other children at risk.  Also, While it may not amount to something you can tell the police, I’d absolutely write an anonymous letter to his employer As anonymous letter isn’t in itself enough to get him fired if he really is innocent, but it’s enough to put his employer on high alert and look for other signs of abuse. (There are usually tons of suspicion prior to having enough to act)."
relationships,ffcozss,t1_ffcn5tl,1579804129.0,"Yes, moving the goal post and gaslighting are absolutely the norm for abusers. 

As a child who was abused by someone my family continued to permit around, you don’t forgive or forget."
Parenting,ffco0i0,t1_ffcnc5x,1579803533.0,Absolutely not a democracy. Kids are not equal to their parents. just as employees don’t get equal say as bosses.   I’m a parent and an employee.  That really is just the way things work.  I’m always astounded when people say otherwise. Good luck to you!
LifeProTips,ffcnj8t,t1_ffb1h68,1579803234.0,how do I do this?
LifeProTips,ffcni6a,t1_ffaj8ot,1579803216.0,"Yep, I have adamantly refused to give them my email address. Why do they want it anyway?"
