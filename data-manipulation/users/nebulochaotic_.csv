As long as you get the sleep you need, I don't think it matters how late you sleep. I'm so glad that you got some good sleep and that it felt good. Getting rest can really help one's emotional health.

I'm glad you can at least get a little bit of privacy and are able to cuddle your pillow to help you feel a little better. When I feel sad, I always just bury myself in my sheets and hug them and my pillow. Are there any people at school that you might be able to get closer to? It's hard to jump from being acquaintances to friends and it may take a little while to start talking with someone regularly, but I really hope you can find a friend that will hang out with you. Friends can really make life a whole lot more bearable when you're having trouble. I know it's hard to make friends, but I hope you're able to try reaching out to someone.

Oh no :( I'm sorry that almost happened. Did you hold it because you don't like going to the bathroom in public places? If so, it might be a good idea to try to tackle that anxiety. I don't know exactly why it makes you anxious (people looking at you, sanitation, etc.), but if you can pinpoint why you don't like it, I think you'll be able to figure it out :) 

Doritos are pretty good and I hope you like them. I don't think I've ever heard of Indian tonic, but it makes sense that it was disgusting lol. It doesn't sound like the most delicious thing in the world.

Hope you're getting some relaxation. It sounds like you're really emotionally exhausted and could use some. Best wishes <3"
Anxiety,fe3k9hr,t1_fe0ccbz,1578850050.0,"Good morning, friend!

I slept pretty well, thank you. I can never really say if I dreamt sweet dreams or not because my dreams always make no sense and I usually forget them soon after waking up because of how abstract they are. I stayed up a lot later than I intended because I was watching videos and trying not to laugh out loud because my roommate was sleeping. At one point, I made a noise and had to pass it off as a cough lol. Because of that I woke up at like 11, which is honestly what usually happens on weekends. I'm so glad you slept well! That's really great to hear! I hope you're able to sleep well again tonight. If you're really having trouble, melatonin really helped me when I had panic attacks during the night a few years back.

If your dad lets you close your door (I don't know how strict he is in that sense), close it and let it out. Let yourself be vulnerable. Hug a pillow if that helps.  It really sounds like you need affection, especially when it doesn't seem like you have a great relationship with your parents. I hope you can get a hug or cuddle someone real soon. When I'm at college, I don't get hugs at all. My mom came over here to drop off some things I forgot at home and I couldn't stop hugging her. I sincerely hope you can get a hug soon and I really wish I could just be there to talk with you in person and give you all the hugs I can give.

That's such bull that your dad gets pissed at everything. Just wondering, are you planning to go to university or are you planning on doing something else after primary school? It's perfectly fine if you have no idea. The only reason I never questioned whether or not I was going to college was because that was how I was raised.

That whole peeing the bed thing was honestly the worst part about being a kid lol. Going to the bathroom in a public place still kind of freaks me out.

I hope you're having a good day so far and that you're doing well. Hope you got those chips you were talking about. Junk food always makes me feel better :)"

Anxiety,fe05jr0,t1_fe00wiz,1578803581.0,"I definitely understand what you mean. I've been told I'm pretty good at detecting emotion as well. 

Sourcream and onion is pretty bomb. I was hesitant to try them at first (which was a while ago), but they're seriously good.

Overthinking does suck and it can really take its toll on your emotional health. If you need to cry, I really suggest finding a safe space and just letting it all out. Find a sad video online and just cry. I always feel so much better after having a good cry. It might help you as well. 

I'm sorry you don't have anyone to care for you and hug you and if I was with you I would 100% give you a huge hug. You deserve to be loved.

I guess I kind of miss my childhood in some aspects. Not worrying about anything. Not caring how I looked. Being able to act crazy and have fun without being seen as childish. It's weird looking back, though, because I realize where all my mental problems stemmed from. Bad experiences with my dad. The first time I had test anxiety. The first time I had stage fright. So I do miss it and sometimes I wish I could go back and enjoy a day in my childhood one more time and not have to worry about graduating college and getting a job. But I know that I'm a more grown-up person now and that I'm better than I used to be back then. 

Also, your dad getting on you about needing to go to the damn bathroom is dumb. What are you supposed to do, pee the bed? Don't listen to him if he gets mad at you about that. Seems like at that point he's just searching for things to tell at you about.

I'm going to go to bed now, but I hope we can keep this conversation going tomorrow. Hope you're able to get some rest :)"

Thank you for asking, but there honestly isn't much that's been bothering me. Ever since I left for college, my overall mood has gotten better since I don't have to mentally prepare myself for my dad knit-picking my every action or raising his voice at me (which always makes me cry). I mean, there's the daily anxiety, ADHD, and depression crap but I've just gotten used to it after having gone through so much therapy and after having lived with it for so long. 

Again, if you need to vent, I'm here. I'll talk to you or just listen to you and I don't need anything back. It brings me genuine happiness when I help someone feel better and, honestly, that's all I need :)"

Getting pushed down so often makes it hard to get up and I'm sorry that they're treating you that way. I'm very proud of you for trying so hard and you should be proud of yourself too. It's been a pleasure talking to you and I really, truly hope you can find peace soon. Never let their harsh words get to you. People usually act that way when they don't want to admit weakness or want to feel powerful. You accepting your feelings makes you powerful. A man who is open about emotions is infinitely stronger than any guy who tries to act hard and emotionless in my book."

Anxiety,fdzfpfg,t1_fdzd7lp,1578789773.0,"Oh my god, I'm so sorry you went through that and I'm so glad that you're out of it now. 

It's definitely OK to feel weak. It's a very human emotion and no one should feel ashamed because they feel that way. Acknowledging your emotions and being comfortable with them is much more strong than ""growing some balls"" or trying to ""man up"". If anyone puts you down for showing your emotions, just know you are infinitely braver and stronger than people who think that way. 

You're definitely trying your hardest and that's amazing. If your body tells you that you need rest, listen to it even if it means doing nothing. I hope you can get some rest and enjoy some honey apple slices soon <3"
Anxiety,fdzbizv,t1_fdz9pkn,1578788529.0,"If you're getting out of bed, then you are trying. You're doing the best that you can right now and that's all anyone can ask of you. Hold on to that shred of hope that happier times are coming. Be gentle with yourself and don't push yourself too hard <3"
college,fdzb3nc,t3_en9a8e,1578788403.0,Goldfish and cashews. So good. GoGo Squeez is also the best thing ever. Portable applesauce that you don't need silverware for? Genius. Those portable Campbell's to-go tomato soups (the ones with sip caps) are also really nice.
Anxiety,fdz9q46,t1_fdz5k7c,1578788025.0,"I do know what you mean. It's hard to show the sensitive and weak side of yourself, especially when you're under fire from your dad. I really hope you can find someone that lets you be yourself and that hugs you and gives you everything because you deserve it. 

Going through something like you're going through isn't easy at all and when you have to try and push aside your emotions to try and stay strong in the face of all that anger even when it's painful makes it really hard to open up. If you can (I know talking to people is hard), try to meet some of those people at school. Join a club if your school does that kind of thing. Since it seems like your home environment consists of a lot of anger and stress on all sides, it would be good to have school be an escape to talk to friends. Again, I know making friends sucks as it doesn't always work out and involves a lot of social interaction. I have a lot of trouble with it, personally. But having at least one person who will listen, give you affection, and let you open up completely can really make all the difference. 

As for the food thing, (I'm going to sound like a total mom so stay with me) I would say trying to work in a fruit or vegetable can help you feel better about what you're eating if it makes you self-conscious. It could be carrot sticks or applesauce. It doesn't have to be a plate of broccoli or anything.

Don't let your parents get to you. I know it's hard when you're around them so much. If you can, do those things your dad always yells at you about before he yells. Don't let him have the satisfaction. At the same time, don't be too hard on yourself. You're doing the best you can and no one should ask any more of you. If you need to push yourself harder, let it be on your own terms. 

Stay strong <3"
Anxiety,fdz6wvi,t1_fdyzkrf,1578787249.0,I second this. Daylio is wonderful and very easy to use.
Anxiety,fdz6sud,t3_enf9j0,1578787212.0,"Anxiety can absolutely cause simple auditory hallucinations. I get them every once and a while. You're not going crazy. Based on your comment about your sleep being poor lately, I think your body and mind are just tired.

I think the reason for it starting when you go into your room is that you're beginning to associate the room with the anxiety, which makes you fear feeling anxious again, which gives you anxiety. If you have some fear that stems from the sound of a doorbell (strangers, for example), it might be that you're feeling anxious for no reason (that's the GAD) and your mind is trying to find a reason for it so that it can anticipate what happens next (i.e. your mind imagines the doorbell ringing when it's anxious maybe so it can try and expect a person being at the front door and can plan for it). Anxiety does step from the fight or flight response, after all.  

While I'm in no way a professional psychologist with a lot of professional knowledge, I am a giant psychology nerd. Regardless, take the above suggestion with a grain of salt. 

If you need recommendations, I would maybe try meditating in your room. There is a great resource called Headspace (it's online and on the iTunes app store) that I would recommend checking out. What it seems like you should do is try and not associate your room with the anxiety. It will take work. Try deep breathing exercises and grounding exercises as well. You're going to be ok. You can fight through this. I believe in you <3"

Anxiety,fdyrvf5,t3_endoj4,1578782925.0,"That's the scary thing about mental illness. I can't remember what I was like before all my depression, anxiety and panic attacks, and intrusive thoughts. But that's in the past and this is you now. 

Depression is awful and it consumes you and makes you not want to do anything. But you have to fight it. Do you have a song that always makes you smile and jam out? Listen to it. Get comfort from loved ones. You were optimistic and motivated then and it seems like you want that again. So fight that depression. Kick its butt. Show it that you won't let it control you and that you can be optimistic and happy. 

What helped me get more optimistic was thinking of my depression and anxiety as an unhelpful little gremlin in my head. If it told me that I should just lay in bed and that I'll never be happy, I would tell it to stop being such a sad sack and that it should just leave me alone. ""Your friends all hate you"". No, you stupid gremlin, they love me and I love them.  ""Remember when you used to be happy lol"". Yup and I'm going to go do something that makes me happy just to prove you wrong. Try it. It might seem weird, but just telling those intrusive thoughts to stop is so powerful. 

You're very strong and you absolutely deserve to be happy. Keep fighting and good luck. I believe in you <3"
Anxiety,fdyq4la,t3_endrzy,1578782462.0,"I understand what you're going through and my explanation is a bit harsh, so I'm sorry if it offends you.

There's a psychological term called ""the spotlight effect"" where you think that everyone is paying attention to literally everything your doing and are judging you when they aren't. Think about it. If you were sitting next to someone in public and glanced at their phone and saw a picture, would you care? Probably not. And if the picture was disturbing, would you not just look away and eventually forget about it? 

The thing is, everyone thinks of themself this way. They think people are paying attention to them way more than they actually are because the only thing you know is your existence. I'm guilty of it too. It's normal and nothing to be ashamed about. People in public are probably more interested in their lives or what you think of them than what you're doing on your phone. 

If it bothers you too much, just don't use social media in public and listen to music instead if you need something to distract you.

Good luck out there <3"
Anxiety,fdyovz2,t3_ends49,1578782111.0,"I had the *exact* same problem a little while ago. 

What helped me the most was doing grounding exercises and using deep breathing techniques (tons of examples online). Talk to yourself, even if it's out loud. Tell yourself it's ok. If you can, get a weighted blanket. They're a bit pricey but definitely worth it. I got one for Christmas and it's honestly one of the best gifts I've ever received.

If you have a day where you barely got any sleep and feel absolutely awful, take a day off. I went to school after having only gotten 3 hours of sleep and it wasn't fun. 

If worst comes to worst, consider taking some melatonin.

I'm serious when I say I know exactly how you feel. This will pass. I promise. Stay positive. Keep fighting. I believe in you <3"
Anxiety,fdynmvk,t3_endtwl,1578781762.0,"Freshman in college here. Going to college is stressful at first. I won't sugar-coat that part. My anxiety was very high and I was so worried that my roommate would suck and that my classes would be too much or that my professors would be awful. Essentially, I was you. Then, I had a moment where it all just melted away. 

In college, you're independent and can choose what to do, when you eat, what you do after class, if you do homework that night or spread it out, and what classes you take. While high school wasn't awful for me, college is so much better.

I will say that there will be obstacles. 

For me, I had to switch roommates because the one I had was very unhygienic (trash everywhere, didn't do laundry, didn't brush her teeth, etc.) and said some things that really put me in a dark place. Don't let me saying that scare you because if you need to switch roommates, do it. I am very happy with my new room and roommate and you deserve to be able to draw the line and change your situation for the better. 

There will be hard classes. CHEM101 for me was way harder than I thought it would be. I didn't put 100% into that class and it showed. 

You will have bad professors at some point. My CHEM101 professor wasn't a great teacher and kind of got on my nerves. But I got through it and my teachers this semester are wonderful. You will absolutely have wonderful professors too.

Here's some advice if you need it:

* Let yourself cry (I didn't at first because I didn't want to admit I missed my house and my mom and my dog, but when I just let go it felt so good)
* **COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR ROOMMATE** (I'm serious. Even if it's just a ""hello"", do it. If you have a problem with something they're doing, try to bring it up. If you can't, try and find a solution or talk to an RA)
* **Talk to people** (Talk to whoever you sit next to in every class. Say ""hi"", ""what's your major"", ""how are things going"", ""do you want to exchange contact info in case one of us misses class"" \[I'd wait a little bit before doing this one\]. Take advantage of the fact that every freshman is feeling at least a little bit lonely)
* Get supplies and textbooks from your school's bookstore **as soon as possible** (the lines will be insane, so if you can't avoid them, make sure your phone is charged)
* Get ahead on your assignments early, if possible (If you have a day where you just can't do homework, your past self doing assignments early will be your savior)
* **SLEEP** (Avoid an 8 am class if you can. There's a kind of ""no-sleep"" culture on college campuses. Don't pull an all-nighter. Make a sleep schedule and try to stick to it. If you can't sleep on the night before the first day of classes because of nerves, keep lying down with your eyes closed. It's better than just giving up and watching Youtube videos. If you can't just lie there, read a book and listen to calming music. There's always melatonin products if you need it)
* **BE PROUD OF YOURSELF** (You made it. All your hard work for the past decade or so has paid off. Reward yourself)
* Accept that college isn't a smooth path, but it also isn't Mount Everest (As I said, there will be obstacles that you'll have to face and hard decisions you'll have to make. You may not get all the classes you want/need. It's ok. You will work things out. Talk to an advisor \[make an appointment as soon as you have a problem or go to walk-in hours if available\], go to tutoring. There are resources to help you overcome those obstacles)
* ***KEEP BREATHING*** (You're ok. You can do this)

Anxiety,fdqtpy8,t3_ems6wq,1578674675.0,"Please don't end your life.

I know it's hard to keep going. I know it's hard to keep living. I don't know exactly why you feel this way, but I am so, so sorry that you feel this way.

I know ending it all may seem like to only way to end your pain. I know it feels like everything is pointless. I've been in your situation. 

I'm going to say this, but trigger warning if you want to skip. I saw a post about a man who survived a suicide attempt via jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. He said he regretted it the moment his feet left the bridge. That hit me so hard and convinced me to fight my suicidal thoughts every time I've started to plan anything out.

Don't listen to the ""a permanent solution to a temporary problem"". Your struggle is valid. You are valid. You are such a beautiful human being. You're so unique. You have a whole life ahead of you. Was there a place you always wanted to visit? A food you've always wanted to eat?

Suicidal thoughts can seem like you're being swarmed by darkness and that there's no escape. But there is. Survive one more day. Live to see the sunset and sunrise one more day. Live to taste your favorite food one more time. Live to watch your favorite video or sing your favorite song one more time. Live because life is beautiful despite how painful it is. 

You are loved. I care about you and want you to live a long, happy, healthy life. If you ever want to talk about how you're feeling, I'm here. Message me and I'll talk with you.

No one deserves to be in the place you're in right now. You've survived 100% of your bad days. Keep that trend going. Find something to look forward to every day, even if it's something small.

Hang in there, friend. You can keep living. You can fight another day. I believe in you <3"

I've been taking Lexapro for a few years now and it sounds like the medication isn't agreeing with you very well. I stopped feeling the side-effects within a week and, even then, they weren't as bad as the ones you're describing. I'd definitely talk to whoever prescribed you the medication about your concerns. 

In the meantime, *don't stop taking the Lexapro*. I know it's making you feel bad and it may seem like the best thing to do is to stop taking it, but *don't stop taking it*. I've heard stories from friends of mine that the withdrawal of Lexapro can be pretty bad. I stopped taking Lexapro over my winter vacation and I felt just kind of...off. It wasn't great and I've started to take it again after getting advice from my psychiatrist. Again, *please don't stop taking your Lexapro*. I don't want you to have to deal with withdrawal right after dealing with the initial side-effects. 

Like I mentioned before, I would 100% talk with your drug prescriber (your doctor or healthcare provider, not the pharmacy where you get the Lexapro) as soon as you can.

I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this and you're very strong for doing so. Hang in there. Good luck <3"

Even if you can't sleep, lay down on your bed and pretend like you're sleeping. Put on some music or a calming video to help drown out your mind's negative thoughts. If you can't stand just lying there, get up, drink some water, and read a book. Not sleeping and keeping yourself awake without trying to relax could make you miserable tomorrow. So, relax. Do deep breathing exercises.

I'm sorry you're so tired and that things haven't been going well recently. You're doing the best you can. Remind yourself of that.

I know he doesn't understand what I'm going through, but I've told him about it. It was very hard and actually telling him came with a lot of yelling and tears. Don't do what I did which was telling him in the heat of an argument. Calmly tell him how you're feeling and, if you want, tell him how he could support you. If he gets angry, try to stay calm. I know it's hard to stay calm when someone's yelling at you, but you'll feel more accomplished afterward if you handled the conversation maturely. 

Reading about what you're going through was like looking into a mirror of sorts. The hard thing that I really hope you don't have to accept is that they may never understand. But, if you're trying your best to calmly explain it to them, you can assure yourself that you're doing everything you can and that you should be proud of yourself for doing so.

Be gentle with yourself. Having anxiety is not your fault and it's hard to fight it every day. Don't let him get to you and make you feel bad about yourself for doing things you can't help.

Anxiety,fdp5hqs,t3_emj096,1578620463.0,"I'm sorry you feel this way and that you're feeling confused. I had a similar experience with a college roommate of mine (which is pretty different from a girlfriend but bear with me). 

I started out with high spirits. We got along great. Then, things started getting bad and I questioned if I was a bad roommate, if she was a bad roommate, if all of our misunderstandings were my fault. I started to associate a lot of anxiety with being in my room and with her. It got pretty bad and I stumbled down into a really dark place. I've never felt more broken up than I did when I was considering whether or not to move. One day I'd be set on doing it. The next I convinced myself not to. I sat around feeling miserable and fighting all my anxious and depressed thoughts. Similar to what's happening with you, I was told by multiple different sources (therapist, resident advisor, family, friends) that it was the right thing to do. 

What helped me overcome it was putting my mental health first. Was it the best thing to do? I had no idea. But, I was so anxious in my current situation and I was miserable so I bit the bullet and changed rooms. I still feel bad every now and then, but then I remind myself how anxious I was and how the reason I moved was to help myself and I feel a little better. 

At the end of the day, make sure to be gentle with yourself and spend time on you. Watch a favorite movie. Hang out with loved ones. Eat junk food. Help yourself recover and get back into a better mental space. The thing is, it's in the past. Sounds kind of harsh but it's the truth. I don't know what would have happened if I had stayed. But, I do know that I'm helping myself feel better now and the fact that I'm in a place where I'm free of all that anxiety to improve my mental health.

Good luck out there. I believe in you <3"
Anxiety,fdp4568,t3_emj8yg,1578619561.0,"It depends on what the question is. If she's asking you about one thing in particular over and over, she may want you to elaborate more so that she can help you through it. If it's something basic like ""Are you doing OK?"", it's just a check-up. Either way, it's not a bad sign.

 From my experience with therapists, they will absolutely ask you the same questions, even if what you're describing is different session to session. It's a little weird at first, so I totally get where you're coming from. Try to answer her questions as best as you can. Don't do anything that makes you too uncomfortable, but if you feel like you aren't getting the help you need/want, you might have to bite the bullet and bring it up. 

I promise telling her won't be as bad as you think. She's a therapist and specializes in helping people through things. If you've only seen her 8 times (I know, sounds like a lot, but therapy starts out pretty slow), try and tell her more about yourself as you haven't known her for very long. What are some things that are causing you a lot of anxiety at work or school or at home? Is there something you need to talk about with her to get it off your chest? Do you want her advice on something? 

Think of a therapy session like a story-telling session and your therapist is a reader and you're the main character. What are you thinking about? Tell her about the ""climax"" (negative or positive) of a certain day and what happened before and after. 

If you just need to talk to her, do that. If you need advice, ask. She's there to help. Good luck <3"

What I can recommend is writing out what you want to say. If there are any specifics about the letters of recommendation, maybe print out a sheet explaining it (use colored printer paper if you can as teachers usually have a lot of paper and it could decrease the chances of them losing it) and give it to them. Don't write out word-for-word what you want to say. Instead, use bullet points and very basic outlines for the conversation.

 For example, 

* Start conversation (greet teacher)
* Introduce topic of interest \[letter of recommendation\] and explain the program
* Explain why you're interested in the program
* Ask for letter of recommendation
* Provide more in-depth information via a printed copy of specifics (if there isn't one provided, you can make your own if you'd like)
* Mention the date you need it by (!!)
* End the conversation and make sure to thank them, even if they say no

Don't rehearse anything and try not to stress about it. If you keep thinking about it, you might psych yourself out and get even more anxious. Remember to breathe. Talk slowly and clearly. If you think you work hard, then you do. Tell yourself ""I deserve this"", ""It'll be ok no matter what happens"", and ""I can do this"" if you need some extra motivation.

You can do this. I promise. Even if nothing goes the way you want it to, you can get through it. I believe in you. Good luck <3"
Anxiety,fdp0nhr,t3_emit6x,1578617198.0,"I'm so sorry you went through this. Panic attacks straight up suck.

I would recommend trying therapy if you haven't already. I have both a psychiatrist and therapist and I can definitely say that coupling both together really helps. The therapist helps you get feelings off your chest and can give you advice on what to do. If you can, I would say you might need to look for a new psychiatrist or talk with your current one about your concerns. My sessions with my psychiatrist are 30 minutes and she makes sure to do check-ups to see if things are working.

I would also recommend trying to get sleep, eat healthy food, take a daily walk (it doesn't have to be a long one), and **drinking water**. I know it might sound like a pain, but it really can help you feel better. Take care of yourself. Anxiety and depression can really do a number on your physical and emotional health and it sounds like you had an experience that absolutely no one should have to go through. You're so strong for getting through it and for calling 911. 

I've had panic attacks in the past and...here's the hard truth...they don't 100% go away. **But** they do get much less frequent. Going to therapy, taking care of your body, doing deep breathing and grounding exercises, finding activities you enjoy, or anything else that takes care of your emotional and physical health can be great in the long run. Weighted blankets are also wonderful, but they are quite expensive which can be a bit frustrating. 

Be gentle with yourself. You went through something very difficult and seem to still be suffering. Keep breathing. Keep fighting. You can do this. You *can* get better and you will. I believe in you <3"

I'm not sure if I'd personally consider myself as having a stutter so I can't fully relate, but being stuck in some sort of weird limbo where you know the words are there but they just won't come out how you want to so you say the same thing like three times with slightly different wording that still sounds weird is something I'm very familiar with.

When you say it's hard for you to write a 5, do you mean it just never looks right and you have to fix it over and over (because I totally do that) or do you mean that it takes a lot of mental effort to get a ""5"" down at all? If it's the second thing, I would try and see if you have trouble writing anything else (i.e. other numbers, certain letters, etc.) and maybe try and write down your feelings while you're struggling (ex: why is it hard? does it feel different to try and write a ""5"" compared to writing other things down?) so you can reference them later if things get worse and you need to talk to someone about it. 

To sum this up, though, I'd say it's a relatively normal thing that comes with anxiety. Anxiety usually causes a lot of excess noise in your head which can make it hard to put together a complete thought and could result in having trouble speaking (that's been my experience, at least).

Fight her bad attitude with a good attitude. If she says ""I don't know, I'm ignoring you right now,"" say something like ""Ok! I see you're busy right now.

I went to therapy. Yes, this is a very typical answer, but even after the panic attacks stopped, having someone to just talk to really helps and I always leave my therapy sessions with an extra spring in my step. Even just talking to a loved one makes me feel infinitely better.

I took time for myself. There are days where I just can't do it. I can't do work. I can't function. I have cold and hot chills at the same time. I keep breathing and do something that makes me happy, no matter how small.

I kept going. Even though I lost my streak without having done self-harm, I've never stopped fighting. I've learned to let myself cry to help myself through it. I've learned to power through even if there seems like there's nothing left for me.

I'm taking care of myself. Positive self-talk is so powerful and I never knew its benefit until recently when I cut my shoulder-length hair to be above my ears. I let myself eat junk every now and then because I deserve it.

You can do it. Take care of yourself. Drink water. Maintain some kind of schedule, even if it just involves getting out of bed. Be gentle with yourself and your emotions. Help others laugh and smile if it's hard to do so yourself. Mental illness is no joke and neither is anything that comes with it.
