WorldofTanks,ffa79o1,t1_ffa6wdq,1579729256.0,"You opinion is wrong. As far as credit grinding goes there are far better options which is the question for the thread. Especially for a begginer. The T34 has mediocre alpha, horrible DPM/reload time, mediocre gun handling and accuracy, requires hulldown in an environment where a large number of its opponents can punch through its turret anyway, its slow, and there is no youtube video in the world that will help that.

Not every tank is a matter of 'playing it right.' Sure you can play it right and have a good game, but you'd have a better game in a better tank doing the exact same thing.

- Skorpion G for example is brainless credit grinding and a tank that should be being recommended legitimately. I own 23 Tier 8 premiums and I just traded in my T34 (which I've owned for 5 years) because it is the only one not worth owning anymore."

WorldofTanks,fekqvv5,t1_fejmqlr,1579205739.0,TBH I would recommend not burning any orders on anything until the end tank. Even if it takes you forever slowly slogging through it will be significantly easier in the long run than doing all 75 of the final missions.
WorldofTanks,fekpem1,t1_fejmxpl,1579204857.0,"If you are newer to the game (don't have tons of crews) I'd advise using the female crewmen strictly as commanders for lines you are grinding to get Sixth Sense right away. Eventually you get so backlogged w/ crews that it starts to make more sense to just slot them somewhere.

For example I have 20 T8 Premiums. And a smattering of T3->T7 prems, some of which came with 0-skill crews. At this point I have a 3 skill crew or better for every tank type/nation that I own a prem for. I have those crews 'trained' for the tech tree tanks of those nations but because you can back slot them to the prem w/o penalty they still see action there.

I'm currently backlogged 8 crewmen in my barracks and that is AFTER I dumped 4 ladycrew into the Tier 6 jap med to start that line, as it's the first line in a long while I didn't have a crew prepped for already.
