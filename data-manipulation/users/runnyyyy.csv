MMORPG,fflpq07,t1_ffl1dfe,1580042597.0,you're asking what a person got from donating to a cause? that's a really weird queston
MMORPG,ffjgzd3,t1_ffivowv,1579998035.0,you really dont want to put up anything positive of the big 5 mmos on this sub. the only positive things can be dead mmos or upcoming ones
videos,ffbwym3,t3_esqhmn,1579785480.0,"I expected the title to be sarcastic, so when the video was half way through I thought to myself ""how does someone that qualified mispronounce hacker?"""
MMORPG,ffbloyo,t1_ffbktad,1579771478.0,eh that's not the case at all for me. I stick to it for the enjoyment of raiding. by far the most fun raids imo (despite a lot of the bosses really being shit). if it was about time invested then I wouldnt have quit the game for 2 and a half expansions and then come back.
worldnews,ff8vj0g,t1_ff8uxgv,1579697516.0,"what.are.you.on.about. loving your child has nothing to do with raising your child. you can raise a child without loving it and you can raise a child wrong while loving it. 

what she was saying is stop thinking about your selfish financial gains and think about the lives of your children, thereby leaving them a livable earth as opposed to ruining it.

but hey, it's not a good sentiment to him because his children will be completely fine, because of that wealth"
worldnews,ff8utcp,t1_ff8q70x,1579696833.0,"but I'm not? literally never taken part in anything like that and only been on the recieving end of activists. I'm just puzzled how they interpreted what she said as ""raising children"""
videos,ff7byf5,t3_erunjb,1579645952.0,"I only 50% agree with her. you obviously shouldnt abuse your parents with babysitting, but they sure as fuck should be able to move their plans around if need be. of course grandparents shouldnt babysit if the parent just wants to go out and party every weekend, and for those 2 specifically it looks like both the grandma and the mother are doing a shit job as parents. 

also why blame a whole generation because YOU failed as a parent"
videos,ff7atlr,t1_ff66zwd,1579644932.0,not technically disabled. iirc the kid's got heavy autism
worldnews,ff6yrkl,t1_ff6pu81,1579637655.0,errhh what the fuck are you on about? are you refering to a different article? this one has nothing to do with raising children....
Jokes,ff5zlnq,t3_erpnx3,1579615248.0,idk. I have big feet and no car yet my dick is small
worldnews,ff5vpnc,t1_ff5qvbc,1579611864.0,well people need scoling now. this issue has been known and taught about for over 30 years and people have barely done anything. it's just like the leaders are procrastinating and will only do it last minute when it might have been too late. leaders need to be pushed to do something right this minute
todayilearned,ff2q5ov,t1_ff2q06l,1579518918.0,think there's 1 when a guy falls off the olyphant. dont know about the first

wow,ff2h6k1,t3_er343r,1579505962.0,"I've failed too many for bullshit reasons, half of them because I wanted to go in blind. was channeling the sanity thing on my lock before attacking a mini boss and then the NPCs pulled the mini boss and I got in combat and ofc died.

lost yesterday on main because I went after a blue pot, the same colour that restored 100 sanity to me, this one cost me 100 sanity .. wtf blizz, why have the pot effects be random and not specific pots"

wow,fdryadp,t1_fdry6xo,1578691504.0,I respectfully disagree. but that's fine.

worldnews,fdp8onw,t1_fdp4fyi,1578622605.0,"nah man, we hate the US because of the shit they've been doing since vietnam. has nothing to do with reddit"
wow,fdp5nn4,t1_fdon6jg,1578620572.0,"? rep requirement and the cost for those essences was reduced by literally 50%. the follower thing is now 16 days instead of 20 for rank 3, which isnt that great obviously."
wow,fdp4vj1,t1_fdol9hv,1578620048.0,"ok? dont know why I'm getting downvoted for encouraging someone to actually try it and not just listen to ALL of the negativity. 

I personally havent done the honor grind yet since I also dont want to do it. but the the rep grind on 1 char is really not bad at all after this patch."
wow,fdojfsf,t1_fdofqxo,1578606369.0,"if you've never done the essences before then it's pretty fun. it's only really an issue on alts. 

The essence requirement was nerfed so you don't have to do the older content for that long. besides, the old content should be new content for you anyways"
StarWars,fdmbut2,t3_em13af,1578545012.0,remember that tease for force ghost qui gon back in ep 1? was so bummed to never actually getting that. at least his voice was in ep 9
worldnews,fdiif5y,t1_fdievtp,1578443620.0,really hope it wont be ww3. hope all the allies follow the UK and refuse to assist the US on yet another dumb war. this time it's just the US against iran and russia

todayilearned,fdabiov,t1_fd9wpb3,1578244150.0,my country (iceland) had the same president for 20 years as well.. people just vote them back in if they're doing a good job.
aww,fcydtwy,t3_ejgf12,1578078582.0,ned upgraded from being the guy in the chair to being the actual chair
AskReddit,fcxtez3,t3_ejdlbw,1578070164.0,"there's 2 that come to mind. one is a family friend that suddenly got arrested. turned out that he was a pedophile and had groped some kids. might have done more, but that's all we heard from 2 of his victims that we also knew.

second was when my childhood best friend (who I hadnt really talked to for 2 years) died at a football practice. his heart suddenly gave out at 18 years old. my then best friend kept saying it must have been drugs. feels pretty damn terrible telling someone that one of your closest friends passed away and instead of getting some comforting words you just get awful ones."
wow,fcxqhik,t1_fcwvyl6,1578069033.0,the biggest difference now in raids is that you often get shit stats on gear that you cant trade. at least we used to be able to give people the gear they want from bosses. but then again we also often got 2 or 3 of the same trash item that no one wants
worldnews,fcxj7bd,t1_fcxa2pg,1578064260.0,in what way? dont see iran being started for the same reason as vietnam was
instantkarma,fcwjycb,t1_fcwefig,1578027674.0,it depends entirely on how strong it is. 2k volts like I expect that one to be would leave you reacting like he did. 3k maybe as well. higher than 3k is probably what you experienced and that shit hurts. roughly 4.5k has your whole arm hurting for like a week.
videos,fcsundz,t1_fcsu2oz,1577925540.0,nah they only patched the side of the cage. if you jump from the car into the bottom of the cage at the right moment you glitch right through it. it has to be frame perfect though
nextfuckinglevel,fcm99rs,t1_fcm3j45,1577767688.0,it really sucks though. looks like he gave him the benefit of the doubt and didnt shoot him.
LivestreamFail,fclbm7v,t3_ehox4b,1577744071.0,shit man even a virgin would say no to a 3sum if destiny is involved
Games,fcez1q4,t1_fcex1ws,1577625060.0,it's literally not marketed as an mmo.. bungie specifically said it ISN'T an mmo. it's a shared-world shooter and an mmo-lite but not a true mmo. we make this distinction because if we didnt almost all multiplayer games could technically be mmos.
Games,fcc7xg6,t1_fcc6j9z,1577595398.0,that's not what I meant. The game is nothing but instances. There's no free open world like in traditional mmos
Games,fcc2f6n,t1_fcbjemj,1577593650.0,because the game is instanced. you dont just randomly meet other players like you do in true mmos
Games,fc9zya9,t3_eguh59,1577560738.0,fuck man this title is so disrespectful. could use passed away instead of dead

videos,fc9z8vv,t1_fc9yoxe,1577560424.0,oh fuck off now. endgame's whole time travel was extremely dumb and a massive plothole but it was still a FUN movie. plot doesnt have to be the only thing about a movie
videos,fc9y7jf,t1_fc9x1cn,1577559978.0,"that's just your opinion. I thought it was a good fun movie. had major flaws of course, but it was still fun."
