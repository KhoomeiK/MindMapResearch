truetf2,fco6ibv,t3_ei3yqy,1577825012.0,"1.) Diamondback - It's everything about the revolver but better.
2.) Revolver - Solid damage output from medium to close range. Good for smaller maps where you don't need a lot of cloak. 
3.) L'tranger - For those prioritize cloak over damage. Good for larger maps, cloak and dagger info spy, or spies who can't/don't aim.
4.) Ambassador - At one point it was a nice utility for long ranged damage. Now it's everything the revolver does but requires more skill, luck, etc. Overall not a very good weapon unless you can aim, the map/area you use it in is small, or it the floor is flat. 
5.) Enforcer - Razorback Snipers, Vacc Meds, or Wrangled Sentries."
