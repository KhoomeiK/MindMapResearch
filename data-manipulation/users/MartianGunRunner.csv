From talking to my friends in the on campus frats, our brothers are closer to one another when compared to theirs. Definitely consider it. We still have events with the on campus sororities and even sororities from other universities. Not many alums but now we mainly focus on the brotherhood, philanthropy and parties.

IAmA,fdiefa7,t3_elgcxp,1578441037.0,What are your thoughts about Southeast Asian nations like the Philippines or Indonesia losing their sovereignty to China through “economic imperialism” and their investment into said nations? And how do you think it will play out in the long run?

changemyview,fdb2jgu,t1_fdb1mpj,1578253031.0,"Look at what happened in 2008 with the Great Recession. Look at how many nations economies fell with ours. If we lost half of our oil supply, like you are insisting on, our economy would absolutely come to grinding halt. I hope Elon can save us but he isn’t a god that can save the whole US economy."
changemyview,fdb1664,t1_fdb0pcg,1578252566.0,Wow. It’s like a very well known fact that so many different economies are connected to the US economy. Where are any of your sources?? You can easily google all of my claims. Stop living in a little fantasyland that the world isn’t a global web. Nations stopped being isolated after WW II.

changemyview,fdaywwo,t1_fdaxjye,1578251953.0,"Lol soooo you’re saying we should just let our economy collapse, which would absolutely spiral several other nations and unions like China, EU, Russia, Canada, India, Japan, etc, etc . Thus destabilizing the world, which would lead to even more resource wars and waayyyy more global deaths? Ok guy you should really read up on the impact of globalization and the world economy. So many nations are economically dependent on the US that if we go down, A whole lot of the world is going down with us. So have fun in your new war filled dark age buddy."
changemyview,fdawu75,t1_fdavdpi,1578251308.0,"You’re argument was the US doesn’t have business in the Middle East. This was wrong. We have business there. Do you understand what would happen if HALF of our oil supply was cut off. Google “gas lines of the 1970s.” Imagine if that happened today. People would be begging the government to invade an oil rich nation. The moment we leave China or Russia is swooping in. I think we can both agree that China would be a lot worst for the Middle East, or maybe we can’t agree and in that case i would tell you to do research into the atrocities of China on its own people. The US has never rolled military tanks into its own city and slaughtered its own students. Imagine how little they care about some middle easterners. The US does have business there to ensure a stable American economy. Also fracking is destroying the environment. I understand it’s sad but that’s geopolitics for you."
changemyview,fdatccf,t3_ekftqq,1578249868.0,It is within the US’s national interest to ensure we have a stable source of oil and to deter Russia and China from controlling the region. So the US actually does have business in the Middle East. It would cripple the US economy to have gas soar to $10+ a gallon.

AskReddit,fcl696j,t1_fcl538m,1577740706.0,"Absolutely, but would it be wise to let nations like the USSR or China do whatever they want without trying to stop them one way or another? I think we can both agree the US is Nooooowhere near perfect but the stuff China and Russia do is pretty messed up. As far as I know the US has never rolled tanks and massacred hundreds to thousands of students like China."
AskReddit,fcl48gz,t1_fcl23h2,1577739462.0,All of human history is founded on genocide. The natives were absolutely brutal to each other and to the settlers. Our ancient ancestors committed genocide against the Neanderthals and other species of humans. With that said we can call out other nations that are committing genocide today because we aren’t actively killing our own people and we know it’s morally wrong. Outsourced violence is another thing in US foreign agenda tho.
