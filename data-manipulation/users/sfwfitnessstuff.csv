veganfitness,ffqjy2m,t1_ffqgk41,1580136654.0,you're in the vegan fitness subreddit telling somebody not to track macros?
nutrition,ffdxjos,t1_ffdhvky,1579831407.0,"no offense but this is like, the opposite of low calorie."
1200isplenty,ffa4u0g,t3_esexbv,1579727904.0,do you add anything to your oatmeal to make it taste better? (Looking for ideas myself)
1200isplenty,ff9oq56,t3_escboo,1579717467.0,"This is pretty similar to what others have said, but I started with pure CICO. Now I've been doing it for 5 months and have lost 30 lbs. Over that period of time I learned that I need to be eating a balanced diet of carbs, fats, and protein in order to eat at a deficit and not feel terrible.  So in my food tracking app I will check and if I see that I'm significantly low on one of the macros for the day I will try to incorporate them into my next snack/meal. And since I do feel inclined to sit down and eat a large amount of food sometimes, I go out of my way to get veggies since you can eat high volumes for low calories."
veganfitness,ff9fz2v,t3_escfna,1579712194.0,"portion size is everything!! I know you said that you eat low fat so many this isnt a good example, but if you don't weigh out peanut butter before you eat it, you could realistically eat like 500 calories of it and not notice. If you're trying to eat at a caloric deficit to lose weight, it could make a huge difference."
fatlogic,ff6igj4,t3_eqhfl0,1579627895.0,"I've had success losing weight with CICO for about 6 months, but I am making some changes in order to combat obsessive thoughts that do nothing constructive for me.

1) I am going to weigh myself only a few times a week instead of every day. I need to make this change because the normal 1-2 lb fluctuations throughout the week really started to stress me out to the point where I started using laxatives for no other reason than to be as ""empty"" as possible by the morning when it's time to step on the scale. Even though I can see the overall weight loss trend, I would ruin my whole morning if I was .5 lbs heaver than the day before. My apologies for TMI. But yeah if scale-obsession is driving me to pick up a gross habit like that, I need to stop. 

2) I am going to eat when I want, until I hit my calorie limit for the day. If this means inadvertently doing IF or even OMAD, so be it. I have learned that I am much better at saying ""okay you've eaten up to your calorie limit, you're done for the day now"" than saying ""don't eat anything right now, you have 600 calories left until you hit your limit and it's only 3pm."" Like I'd literally agonize for hours about wanting to eat ten almonds but feeling like I had eaten too many of my calories too early in the day. But now I'm realizing that all that anxiety goes away and I can start focusing on LIFE again if I just eat my allotted 1500 calories at whatever pace I want!"
loseit,ff6azun,t3_erpi0m,1579623240.0,hopefully this is the sort of thing you only need to do once to get the lasting mental effect!
fatlogic,fetghbb,t3_eq7dkb,1579375186.0,"this is a good example of why i will never initiate a conversation about diet or fitness, especially with coworkers. it can become emotionally charged really quickly. you really can't predict what somebody's experiences or attitudes about food are, better to just steer clear."
veganfitness,fesv7y4,t1_feo1qqa,1579369341.0,thank you sooo much for this! i really appreciate it. you should feel really proud of yourself for having such an awesome diet/fitness routine!!
veganfitness,fen2lhg,t3_epteg1,1579275577.0,"You have quite an attitude problem. First off, downvoting a low-value post doesnt make people horrid. Second, you need to take responsibility for your weight gain. If you were truly eating the correct amount of calories for you would not have gained 15 lbs."
veganfitness,fen0ocm,t3_eputd3,1579274338.0,my friend went vegan and gained 30 lbs within a year but i think it's because she thinks it's okay to have 1000 calories of white rice with every meal.
veganfitness,femyydk,t3_epwmwe,1579273173.0,you look absolutely amazing and I would love some details about your diet and exercise habits! not sure why everybody is complaining about your title.
askfatlogic,fekwe4r,t3_epp3iu,1579208982.0,"definitely check back here if you find actual research on it, because there are a shit ton of white fat activists. you say you see a pattern of lots of women of color glorifying obesity, but I really don't see it like that at all. both of our perceptions of this stuff have the same value (none) because we have no stats to back it up. from what I see online, for every person of color talking about how \~fatphobia is racist\~ there is at least one white fat activist fervently cheering them on."
fatlogic,fekswqi,t3_epngga,1579206926.0,"I personally am not impressed by artists that draw a lot of women but give them tiny waists with huge boobs and interchangeable ""perfect"" faces every time. So I move on and support artists who draw more diverse characters because I find them more interesting. Seeing the cookie cutter art of women doesn't make me feel rage, just boredom. If you feel like you have to go beyond just ignoring the art and start saying nasty things to the artists, you need to do some self reflecting on your insecurity and unchecked entitlement."
fatlogic,fedp456,t1_fedm7t9,1579016832.0,they used to have 240kcal pints?? Now i'm mourning the loss of something I never even experienced :(
loseit,fedojg8,t3_eolqq3,1579016467.0,"It sounds like you already know what you could improve upon if you wanted to be losing more than an average of 0.75lbs/week. Plenty of people lose weight faster than that. That doesn't mean that your 15lb loss and the other changes you've made to your body aren't something you should be proud of. 

I have had a very similar experience as you as far as results go- 20 lbs in 6 months. Could have lost more if it weren't for cheat days on the weekends. More consistency would definitely mean faster results, but I don't think I have it in me to be 100% disciplined every day of the week. I've accepted that, and you have to decide for yourself if you will too."
fatlogic,fdh1qjp,t3_elcpmx,1578413487.0,"My friend went vegan a year ago and has gained at least thirty lbs since then. (I am vegan too so this is NOT about vegan hate). She has always been obsessed with social media and physically appearances and she is very distressed about being borderline obese when she used to be petite. 

She refuses to believe that her diet is what has caused her weight gain. She either insists that she doesn't eat much food at all, or that she is eating mostly vegetables so there's no way that has caused her to put on weight. But she regularly posts pics of her food plates on her vegan-centered instagram and there are usually HEAPING portions of rice, noodles, etc. along with her veggies. I am very tempted to reply to one of her instagram stories and explain to her how high-calorie her meals are. She also will start whining about being hungry if she doesn't eat a full three meals a day at least, so I wouldn't be surprised if she's eating 3000+ calories at least a few days a week. When she did come to be for weight loss advice, I told her to download a calorie tracking app. She deleted it within three days. I will hold my tongue unless she comes back for more advice, but it's hard to watch!!"
running,fdgzzpr,t3_elcrjs,1578412380.0,"A few of my coworkers and I started running together at least once a week after work. Nothing crazy,  4-8 miles at a time. After the longer runs that felt really good (definitely some runners high there), we would stand in the parking lot and have great conversations and we almost had to force ourselves to go home. I think it improved our relationships with each other in the best way possible and consequently improved how well we collaborate together. I am not surprised by the claims in that article at all. If you situation allows it, I would highly recommend starting a running group with coworkers!"
