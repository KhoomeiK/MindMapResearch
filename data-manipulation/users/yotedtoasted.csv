AmItheAsshole,fcszvog,t1_fcsyxw7,1577929273.0,"It really is up to OP in the relationship to fix everything.  Overall, I feel as though giving her the gift is the right way to go whether she's polite about it or not.  She may simply be defensive and not want to open up or appear weak in front of OP by apologizing and wants the gift but doesn't want to take responsibility.  I simply don't feel as though not giving her the necklace is the way to go as it will only worsen things.  We also don't know whether this is a common occurrence or a fluke.  How has it been 3 years and OP has yet to form a good relationship with the 13yo?  If it is a fluke there may be some influence from the 13yo's mother.  There is a lot of information missing which is necessary."
AmItheAsshole,fcsto34,t1_fcst7jj,1577924824.0,"Two wrongs don't make a right.  The 13yo is trying to make amends by accepting the gift.  Her attempting to get the gift back shows that she is remorseful and realised that she did want the gift, it shows humanity.  From my perspective it seems like this is the 13yo way of making amends by accepting the gesture from OP.  Punishing her will only negatively affect the relationship, giving her the gift can only be positive.  Although I can't be sure, I believe this is the 13yo's way of trying to reverse her mistakes.  A lot of this can't be confirmed unless we know the demeanor of the 13 yo when she was asking for the gift back."

You had a chance to show that you didn't care about her disapproval and loved her anyway but instead you foster your seemingly mutual disapproval of eachother.
