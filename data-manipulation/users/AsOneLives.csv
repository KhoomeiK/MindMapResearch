SL is an MMO. It’s literally a SecondLife. No objectives. You can build things in game or import from 3D programs. You can go to different sims (areas that people buy and can sell/rent land off of etc). And play games, meet people, explore themed sims etc. I never knew what GOR was, but aaaalllllllways saw people in GOR attire/groups around. Cool to know where it came from. Funny that I wouldn’t have googled it otherwise xD"
