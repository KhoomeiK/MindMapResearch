Cartalk,ffioglv,t3_ets8z8,1579978766.0,Ferrari Mondial. One of the worst Ferraris ever. It was featured in the Worst Car in History of the World by Jeremy Clarkson and James May. The steering position is weird and pretty much saws your testicles as you drive. The back seats were made as if for someone without a body below their pelvis. It broke down often and it had the same 0 to 60 time as a Volkswagen Golf of that era.
