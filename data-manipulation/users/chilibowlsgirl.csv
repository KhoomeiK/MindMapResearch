careerguidance,ff9mau3,t3_esfl9v,1579715980.0,I have about a 30 minute commute to work. My suggestion is to have an awesome playlist that’s long enough for you to listen to it twice before it ends. That’s what I do and my commute to work and back is my time to listen to music and chill before I have to deal with the responsibilities at work and home

relationship_advice,fezeurh,t3_eqzim8,1579456590.0,"Honestly like you said he manipulated you. He could have just confessed his love to you to get you to send pictures to him. Any person that uses suicidal statements or threats to hold on to a person is emotionally abusive because that is not fair to you and it is not your responsibility. If you still want to be friends with him then I would suggest just keep him at arms length until you know his true intentions. Don’t let him make you feel guilty for not doing anything he wants you to do. Best of luck to you

Edit: just saw the part where you say you want to let him go. Do it, he will be okay"
