> Results from the Phase 1b portion of the CARTITUDE-1 study showed early and deep responses among patients (n=29) with a median of five prior multiple myeloma treatment regimens (range, 3-18) treated with JNJ-4528 (median administered dose 0.73x106 CAR+ viable T cells/kg), with 100 percent of patients achieving a response (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 76-95) at a median six-month follow-up. The overall response rate (ORR) included 69 percent of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or better (66 percent achieving a stringent CR); 86 percent of patients achieving a very good partial response (VGPR) or better; and 14 percent of patients achieving a partial response (PR). In addition, 100 percent of evaluable patients achieved early minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative disease status at day 28 post-infusion. At the six-month follow-up, 27 of 29 patients were progression-free.

Datacenter hardware, real estate, storage, replacing said hardware every 3-5 years, the costs continue to increase, while cloud costs continue to decrease.  Right now we estimate $1500/yr per small on-prem VM with 100GB of storage vs $750/yr on AWS."

3Dprinting,fcnxml8,t1_fcnmx8l,1577820443.0,Crazy cheap compared to the past I would guess.  I was talking to a relative who was an engineer in the 80s and 90s for car interior parts like dashboard trim pieces.  He said they used resin printers for prototyping and it would cost them about $1000 per palm sized print in just consumables.
