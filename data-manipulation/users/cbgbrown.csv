How do you know which type of mental health specialist to locate?!

See if you qualify for the Healthy Michigan Plan.

The Healthy Michigan Plan provides health care benefits to Michigan residents at a low cost so that more people can have health care coverage. Individuals are eligible for the Healthy Michigan Plan if they:

Have income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level* ($16,000 for a single person or $33,000 for a family of four)

*From FAQ:

Q: Will the Healthy Michigan Plan cover family planning services?

A: Yes, the Healthy Michigan Plan will cover family planning services with no out-of-pocket cost to patients."
AskDocs,fewcyiy,t1_fewbzpa,1579408566.0,Can I ask what state you're in?
AskDocs,fewaxad,t3_eqr69z,1579407733.0,"NAD - I have an old Norplant and now a recently expired Nexplanon in the same arm. I have no desire to go through getting them removed, and my gyno said they're fine there, as long as no issues arise. He did say Nexplanon is *my words here* approved to prevent pregnancy for 3 years but if left in longer it may last for 4 years. So, if you're trying to get pregnant, then it needs to come out.

Qualifying for the type of Medicaid that solely covers BC/Family Planning Services is much easier than full coverage Medicaid. 

Also, have you contacted your local Health Department? They have family planning services."
