Also, talk with your person about your feelings...very often the feelings will be mutual and you can find something to do together that will change how you feel. Take a trip, go to a concert or take a class together. When you’re doing these things, think of how fun it is to be with someone who is willing to stick with you through the fun times and blah times."
AskWomen,ffgligv,t3_etgo51,1579909009.0,"I’ve changed a lot. I always say if I met my 20 year old self I’d want to punch me in the face. I was very insecure but wanted so desperately to seem like I had my act together. So I did that by being very mean and judgmental towards others and their actions. It was such an act and I hated it. I had some friends who were the same way, and I felt that because they liked “mean” me, it was ok. But I thought for a long time about who I wanted to be and started making changes. Those friends dumped me and I was better for it. I’ve never been able to make up for some of the mean things I said to others while I was “that girl” but I’ve found that carrying their hurt and embarrassment I caused with me it helps me be purposefully kind. So instead of being mean on purpose, I try to be kind on purpose and not toot my own horn just because I’m treating people the way they should be treated."

Also, your snake plant looks so good! I’m jealous! I rescued mine from the clearance section and it’s still struggling. Maybe I should put it near the printer?"
