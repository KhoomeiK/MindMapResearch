JusticeServed,ffxqkyp,t3_evo8y7,1580330461.0,"This reminds me of what happened to a guy at a club when my friend was a bouncer. 

Me and bouncer friend were just chilling by the entrance watching out for people who tried to pull anything funny when entering the club, then we check these group of guys, probably in their late 20s. 

Now these dumbasses thought that cause my bouncer friend was shorter than them, he was about 168cm tall, that they could try their luck. But what they didnt know was that he was also a pro body builder. Guys try messing around and the one dude got slapped so hard that his eardrum got bust open and one of his friends literally got picked up over my friends head movie style and thrown in the bushes. I honestly didnt know whether to laugh, be shocked or thankful that this muscle bound beast was my close friend."

And in your edit you added that you feel bad cause he cant do anything. My dear, get out. You should not have to deal with any of this. Contact a friend or relative and move out today or tomorrow. This type of relationship has damaged you enough, your mental sanity is far more important. And I also think you need to lay charges because hes basically tryna rape you."

AskMen,ffnsioh,t3_eu2ixr,1580070200.0,"I've been in many fights. All when I was under 18. After that none. 

Learning to fight is good, for self defense and it also teaches u what to do in dangerous scenarios and can often help make sure you dont freeze up.

But fighting, unless you really have to is a no no. I used to get into a lot of fights cause of bullys. Older kids would bully me, until one day I fought back. And then pretty much kicked the ass of  anybody who bullied me until one day these guys jumped me, I gave the one guy a black eye. His parents called the police and I got into shit for assault. Had to attend a 13 week course for delinquents after I appeared in court. I was 15 at the time. That woke me up to how dangerous these things are for my future, cause if I got a record I could have kissed and scholarships and such goodbye, if I was 18.

Apologize, be the bigger man. Avoid the fight. Not only cause u could get charged but also cause people are fucked up, today you fight with one guy. Tomorrow 10 of his friends are breaking down your door with knives or guns. Or waiting for u some where to seriously hurt u or anyone with you. Things escalate very quickly. 

But if u do get into a fight, never throw the first punch. And never continue hitting the person once they down. Otherwise u lose all claims to self defense."
