Anyone playing a limited deck with 17 lands and gets to replace 5 basics with better fixing and 5 free scries should be stoked. Yes you are out 5 potential rare creatures, but you also get to play every powerful and uncommon and removal spell.

On the saccharine end of the scale I would recommend either Rochworld by Robert L Forward, or the Solar Clipper series by Nathan Lowell. Series starts with Quarter Share. These novels have low points but are almost without antagonists compared to other authors. Still spellbinding imo, but not all grimdark

Midscale I would recommend Robert J Sawyer. Has conflict, but upbeat.

At the lower end I would say Lois McMaster Bujold. Plenty of conflict, but I think it's mostly positive.. the genocides are in the past and humans have spread out to the stars"
