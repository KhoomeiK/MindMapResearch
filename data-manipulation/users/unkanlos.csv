Here is an article on what the Akita was bred for https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/akita. Yes one of those animals was a bear, but it was not bred specifically to fight bears."
todayilearned,ff02r8t,t1_fezwf4n,1579464544.0,Apparently in this context go is used more along the lines of a title. A way of saying it's an animal not a human
todayilearned,fezqyay,t1_fezostw,1579460535.0,They were bread as a large hunting dog. Bears just happen to be on that list. Being their largest hunting dog it was the best choice for bears.

askcarsales,feidkah,t1_feid75h,1579136006.0,I was hoping someone could point me to a website with some reliable facts and figures I could work with. Things like what % of vehicle sold needed major repairs by specific milages.

Gunpla,fdfisev,t1_fdez4bi,1578362683.0,"Yes, as long as you did not sael the water slide on with top coat or something. Now if the decal has fully dried it may be deformed to the panel lines it's over, and will look odd if you reposition it. The first time you put it on you have as much time as you want to position it, as long as you keep it wet."
Gunpla,fdelnr0,t1_fdegkxl,1578341650.0,Water slides are the most forgiving decal to use. If you don't like how it turned out just get it wet and take it off.

Futurology,fcliwih,t1_fclf62q,1577748846.0,"Like people with coal mining jobs can afford the internet. I also like how we both agree that coal is one of the worst forms of energy production, but since I have a countering opinion I automatically have some vested interest in coal.  Thanks for admitting I was right by the way. If your only counter argument was I didn't fully read one of your non reputable sources then you truly are out of points. If you want to say someone is wrong that is your right. If you want people to respect your counter point go find several scientific studies on the subject, read several of them, not just the ones that the title agreed with your point of view, then go out ask your opponent to read it and discourse with them. If you want people to think you are a flaming twat resort to name calling when they don't see things your way."
Futurology,fclda90,t1_fckam6r,1577745142.0,"I like how you completely ignore the argument and substitute your own. The argument is that depending on where you live an electric car can in effect lead to higher CO2 emissions then a similar class of fossil fuel vehicle. None of the sites you posted are reputable studies and were all found from a simple Google search. This is called confirmation bias. These sites even go against your argument because they average out all of the power plants in a nation not just coal ones. Their arguments are as a whole EV produce let's CO2 then FF vehicle, and that going forward EV's will become more CO2 neutral. This is true, but it is not the argument."
