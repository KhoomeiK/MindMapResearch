AskReddit,fge5io0,t3_exvrzj,1580691822.0,"I grew up with pranks in my family. We had cousins of mine live with us here and there throughout my child hood, which was fun. I remember one of my cousins scared the shit out of my mom one time putting something in her shoe and she got him back by putting dog shit in his shoe.
Another time, my cousin gave me this Girls Gone Wild VHS, which was gold to 13 year old me. On the ride home it fell out of my waist band and fell onto the floorboard. I tried to play it off, it went under the seat so when I got out of the truck, I couldn't grab it. I snuck out later that night to grab the tape but it was gone. I knew I was fucked..I snuck back into the house and back to my room and my stepdad jumps out ""WhAT aRe yOu lOOkinG fOR?!?!"" Laughing his ass off.
My sisters used to listen in on land line phone conversations and make fun of me forever about whatever whackass game I was try to spit some chick. Lmaoo. I'm glad I grew up during the time I did."

medlabprofessionals,ffs4ln2,t1_ffs43v1,1580172999.0,"I have not worked in the field service but a long time ago, I was advised that a good way to get insight on field service is to get to know the field service techs that come in. I've spoken to many and they all have pretty much the same thing. Many of them have a lab background. But they always say the same thing, you have to just keep trying until you get your foot in the door. You might even have to look out of state if you're willing.

Also: a new field service tech knows nothing about what they will be working on. You get a job at a company and they train you. You just need to be able to prove that you have the ability to learn such things. (Obviously a general knowledge of things is required) but as an MLS, you learn these analyzers like the back of your hand, were able to remedy most problems before having to call for support."
medlabprofessionals,ffs41ud,t1_ffs3qho,1580172606.0,"Yes. It's just very hard to get into because the job openings are few and far between. People dont leave those jobs. It looks good for an MLS because you've had hands on experience with many analyzers.

Edit: and not only are MLS familiar with analyzers but they understand the science behind the tests and results."

microgrowery,ffmhyjt,t3_eu8k80,1580054933.0,"I had these small knats flying around, looked closest to a thrip from what I could find. I bought a bottle of some organic pesticide that worked decent enough, but you have to be diligent enough with the spraying over a period of time in order to completely rid the problem, but still they seemed to hide and show up most prevalent during watering. So, I tried the ole apple cider vinegar in a cup trick, not even one knat went for it. Next, I took the top from my jiffy starting pods box and added water with a little mix of that pesticide I bought and what do you know, they swarmed to it and were gone within the week. Haven't seen a single pest since. One thing I will mention that probably helped my case, its helpful to refrain from watering your plants for a couple days and then go in with the organic pesticide. The pests will be searching for moisture. I poisoned the watering hole, and it worked."
