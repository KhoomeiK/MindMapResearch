Bowling,ffguucw,t1_ffgnom3,1579915637.0,"Don't try to throw the ball the same way you throw your strike ball. Stand a little left of the center of the lane and try to throw a straight ball sightly to the right. Most people I see usually put as much hook on their 10 pin shot as their strike ball. This leaves you with very little wiggle room though.

With enough practice, the 10 pin becomes a little less intimidating."
Bowling,ffgiubo,t1_ffgf61j,1579907233.0,"Don't feel bad, everyone has to work on their corner pins. I have two guys on my team that are over 230 average and they miss 10 pins from time to time as well."
Bowling,ffgifx7,t3_et1px8,1579906964.0,"Nice game, gotta work on your spares though. If I were you I'd take a whole game and just work on getting your ball to go where you want it to go other than the pocket. So many people are worried about throwing strikes that they never really take the time to practice ball placement. Even if you have a full rack setup, try and aim for the 10 pin and on your second ball try and aim for the 7 pin. You score will be terrible, but that's not important during practice anyways. You'll eventually learn muscle memory and understand the ball and your abilities better. If you do this every time you bowl, you'll be over 200 in no time."

wholesomememes,ffebvzt,t1_ffe8rwq,1579842515.0,"The fact that it's unregulated and uses math, not people, are huge selling points for me. I also love the fact that there is no reversal of funds possibly. Say you're a painter and you paint a house. The person pays with their credit card and everyone is happy. Then the person files a claim that you never painted the house. The credit card company could actually reverse the funds and you're out all the money. I'm not saying it happens a lot, but it's possible. With almost all cryptos, once the transaction is sent, it can't ever be reversed. 

I do like to dream of a world where payments will be super simple. I've seen a few people online get nfc chips installed in their hands. Then wherever Bitcoin is accepted and has nfc, they can just tap their hands to the device and payment is sent. I'm not saying this is a smart solution, but I like the idea of never needing to carry cash or a wallet.

As for the price issue, that's one of the biggest reasons why Bitcoin is being called a store of value and not really a currency. For a currency to be practical, it has to maintain it's value (or close to its value). A lot of people are seeing Bitcoin more like gold than money. There are quite a few currencies that are pegged to different assets that are stable though. These currencies are called stable coins. If a stable coin is pegged to the US dollar, they normally have an actual bank account with X dollars sitting in it, one dollar for each coin in circulation. For example, if they have 100,000 coins and it's pegged to the US dollar, they'd need to have 100k sitting in a bank somewhere. As you can probably tell, this seems like a terrible idea and defeats the whole point of crypto in the first place. There's also non-collateralized currencies that aren't pegged to anything, but they try and keep the price stable by buying up coins when the price is low and releasing more coins when the price is high. The best solution in my opinion though is just waiting until crypto becomes so main stream that no one will even care about selling it. What's the point of selling it for USD if you can spend the crypto easier than fiat and you can use it everywhere? Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I believe the mass market adoption isn't too far away."

I actually meet the creator of Crypto kitties randomly at a club at a gaming conference once... we had an awesome chat about blockchain tech.

It seems like I could research or talk about those 3 things indefinitely. By far though, my number 1 special interest is my wife. Most people don't realize that people could even have a special interest in people. When it comes to my wife, I want to know everything about her (not in a stalker kind of way, but in a I love her so much, I feel like I should know every little detail about her kind of way). When she's in a different room than I am, I find myself wondering what she's doing. If she's looking at her phone and smiling, I find myself wishing I knew what brought her so much joy (once again, not in a jealous our stalker kind of way). I think a good way of explaining it is when you have a new boyfriend or girlfriend and you can't seem to get enough of them no matter how much time you spend together... that's how I feel all the time with my wife. She never gets boring, we never went through the 7 year itch that some couples do, we've never even really had a big fight.

wholesomememes,ffcbatx,t3_esshe5,1579795736.0,"I have high functioning autism (keep in mind it's a spectrum and everyone is different). The thing that bothers me the most is when people treat me differently. My autism sometimes makes it hard to realize people are treating me differently, but when I figure it out or someone brings it to my attention, it really bums me out and makes me question everything and everyone. I'd much rather someone tell me if they already know something rather than act like they don't to try and make me feel better. Keep in mind I'm not a child and I can't speak for anyone else.

I also couldn't care less about person first language, like some of the other commenters have posted. I understand the point of it and it makes sense, but to me personally...it really doesn't matter. I also don't see autism as a ""bad"" thing and I'm not ashamed of having it.

**Edit:** If you know someone with autism and you want to make them smile, talk to them about their special interests. Most people with autism (myself included) have special interests. Special interest(s) are kind of like hobbies on steroids. Most people would even call it an obsession, although it's really not. Anyways, we tend to care about our special interests so much that people eventually start to get upset or bored whenever you even mention them. So if you show even the slightest amount of excitement towards their special interest, it'll probably make them happier than you can even understand. I'm not great at understanding my own emotions, but if someone starts talking to me about bitcoin, my stomach almost like begins to shake and I feel tingly(?) thought my body.

I'm constantly trying to figure out the long-term impact of my actions and parenting decisions on my kids. 

While my emotions are confusing and may cause some problems from time to time, my autism provides me with some unique abilities that most people don't have. My whole life I've had to study people in order to be ""normal"". This, combined with my above average ability to spot patterns and trends havev allowed me to create a few successful businesses. In turn, this allows me to spend way more time with my kids than most parents get to. It also allows me to take my kids to different countries and show/teach them that not everyone lives the same way and why we should be grateful for a lot of stuff that most people take for granted. My ability to think without emotions allows me to teach them how to think for themselves and not be a puppet like most people are. My obsession of science and space has lead to my kids dreaming of one day being the first people on Mars. The pure joy on my daughter's face as she looked in our telescope and saw Saturn for the first time, let's me know that I'm not all that bad of a dad. We run experiments all the time. We 3d print cars to see which designs are faster. We build circuits and make our own bubble machines. My kids love when the sun is shining in the house so they can operate their solar panel. My constant thirst for knowledge allows me to pass things down to them that most people don't even realize.

The more people I mention it though, the more I'm starting to realize that no one really cares (in a good way). I have yet to have anyone treat me any differently or take pitty on me.

Bowling,ff0313o,t1_ff01bk1,1579464658.0,"Depending on your angle and speed, physics might be able to explain it easily. With that being said, there are some variables that come into play as well. A pin isn't set in the same spot every time. There's an acceptable margin of error for each pin. Sometimes a bad break is simply because a few pins are slightly off spot. There's other things as well like rev rate, speed and oil that's always changing. 

To leave a 5 pin with a pocket shot, you either have to come in really flat or be a straight bowler (or close to being a straight bowler). If you have even a small amount of hook and you gott the pocket on the correct side, the ball will take out the 5 by itself. Well, assuming you're using a ball that's more than like 10 lbs, lighter balls can actually deflect off of the 1 pin and avoid the 5 pin. The same thing can happen if you throw the ball really slowly. If none of that applies to your shot, that means you either missed the pocket and went through the nose with a decent amount of revs, or you got super unlucky. I threw a perfect strike once and watched the pin bounce out of the gutter, get hit by another pin and stood back up. Sometimes, against all odds, crazy things do happen."

Bowling,fezo1dk,t3_eqyunk,1579459527.0,"This is just basic physics. When you hit a Brooklyn you're sending way more pins towards the 10 pin, your odds of carrying the 10 is drastically higher. That's why you almost never leave 7 pins on a pocket shot. 

If you're leaving 10 pins consistently, you have to change the angle of your shot a little. Just hitting the pocket doesn't mean much if your angle is off. That's why straight bowlers tend to leave the 5, 8 or 9 pins with their pocket shots, crankers tend to leave more 9 pins and low rev guys tend to leave a lot of 10 pins."

Bowling,fefy7dy,t1_fefvjnr,1579069208.0,We have a few rules when it comes to wild cards. A natural Royal Flush is the top hand followed by a natural 4 of a kind and then 5 of a kinds.
Bowling,fefrhlz,t1_fefeu38,1579063069.0,We're an equal opportunity card using team. Whatever deck gets shuffled first is what we use. We've used everything from tiny joke cards to cards the size of a normal sheet of paper.

Bowling,fef749p,t1_fef57h1,1579049750.0,"Yeah, we have a lot of gambling within our team as well as random bets with random people. I have a running weekly bet 20$ a game and 30$ series with two different people. We also owe each other 10$ for every 7-10 split that gets left and 1k if anyone ever converts it."
Bowling,fef4d8z,t1_fef1dwe,1579047893.0,It varies all the time. Sometimes it's 1$ sometimes it's 5$ or even 10$. We also have to pay a buck anytime you open or get hung.
Bowling,fef4611,t1_fef1m59,1579047756.0,"We're either the best team to bowl against or the worst. We drink and gamble way more than any other team and we probably care the least about scoring well or winning games. Even though we don't care about it, we can still bowl our asses off. Last night we shot 3535 series for a 5 man team and our best game was 1271. That's 235 average per person on the series and 254 average per person on the game. That's not our norm, but it's not too far off either though."

3Dprinting,feemuvj,t3_eopgiz,1579036963.0,So every single picture the extruder had to move itself all the way over and then come back to do the next layer? If my extruder has to move more than half an inch away from my print I have to pray to the printing gods that it doesn't bump the print and knock it free from the platform haha.
3Dprinting,feelrl3,t3_eo79d6,1579036329.0,"So I think I figured out what is going on. After checking all the possible complicated issues, I decided to try another print. A few minutes into the print I was hearing  a strange ticking noise. I watched the print for a few minutes and realized the problem is the filament is messed up on the roll itself. It's like wrapped under itself and it's struggling to pull itself off of the roll. The ticking sound was being created when the filament was rubbing up against itself. Something so simple had me scratching my head for days."
WTF,fedobpm,t1_fecycgl,1579016330.0,"Glitter terrifies me for some reason. I hate how one piece of glitter eventually turns into 100 somehow. I can't really put my finger on why we fear it so much though. When I was younger, a single piece of glitter being on me could cause me to have panic attacks. Over the years I eventually taught myself that glitter isn't going to hurt me. One day I was able to take a bottle of glitter and pour some on myself. This made me freak out a little, but since then I've been able to tolerate glitter being around me. I still hate it and avoid it at all cost, but I'm not as irrational as I used to be."

3Dprinting,fe9y3s4,t1_fe9vz8g,1578942487.0,Not on the first print (the image that I posted). On the next attempt I did measure it.
