Hardcore,ffk3sha,t1_f25h55z,1580014933.0,His album Animal Rights is pretty gnarly too.
AskReddit,ffjhmqc,t1_ffj8qqv,1579998421.0,"Yeah the above comment is a really simplistic view of the world. I get it in theory and even agree with it, but as someone starting to build a family, I’ve got to do what is best for them and not necessarily everyone else. I also agree that this is a sure fire recipe for growing resentful based on firsthand experience.

I think a better way to think of this is to not actively fuck people over if you don’t have to, and help them out when you can. Of course, this is probably too pithy and short to cover all bases as well."
RedHotChiliPeppers,ffhif84,t1_ffhgf8s,1579936665.0,Not even close.
GuitarAmps,ffgxx7q,t3_ejqiro,1579917901.0,"I'm seriously thinking of doing this.  Can't make the February one, but maybe some other time.

I'm getting into electronics as a hobby -- do you feel like you learned a lot about that from this experience, or was it more a paint-by-numbers sort of thing?

Edit: Just watched your video. Cool stuff. It's also on their website."
kratom,ffeafgj,t3_et52ed,1579841211.0,"I seem to have the opposite issue. I’ve honestly not really experienced any withdrawals when I take extended breaks (and from what I understand, this puts me very much in the minority), but I have found that my irritability can increase when I take kratom. The benefits still outweigh this negative, but it is something I keep in mind.

Sorry, this probably isn’t particularly helpful. But all that said, I do think it has an impact."
VinylDeals,ffcd8d3,t1_ffag67x,1579796941.0,Agreed.
electricsix,ffbb2wy,t3_eskpyt,1579758109.0,That’s cool. Any good stories?

todayilearned,fezd4ex,t1_fez5v5m,1579456090.0,"Yeah I remember thinking it was a really cool idea in 2007/8, but that there was nothing I was interested in watching."
todayilearned,feymq7e,t1_feyeufh,1579447669.0,"Yeah and it mainly consisted of old Doctor Who episodes, which is great if you’re into that thing."
GuitarAmps,fetru8v,t1_fescrto,1579379193.0,You can’t tell from the pic but his bedroom is an arena.
AskReddit,fem6xn4,t1_fem34xr,1579241936.0,I like this attitude. Thanks for sharing.
RedHotChiliPeppers,fechrqw,t1_feaergm,1578974226.0,I don't think they understand what that means.
changemyview,fe0arz3,t1_fe0857v,1578808034.0,"I think he or she is saying that they’re still in the exposure stage (meaning they are just taking in cultural influence and not offering anything), but in a couple of decades they may have innovations, so I think that assertion works with your observations. But who knows."
MusicBattlestations,fdyizvx,t1_fdy8n2u,1578780282.0,"Sorry, meant the thing to the right of the MPC. But that is cool."
MusicBattlestations,fdxxyor,t3_en7ruu,1578774049.0,"What’s the gray box in the upper right corner? Nice setup, by the way."

kratom,fdjk3m0,t1_fdjk1fx,1578474563.0,Ok
kratom,fdjj9p7,t1_fdjhxf5,1578473392.0,I went cold turkey for 3 weeks from a daily habit of nearly two years that regularly ranged anywhere from 12g to 48g (more often somewhere in the 24g-36g range) and experienced zero withdrawal symptoms. It was actually nice to take a break from it.
synthesizercirclejerk,fdjiovt,t3_elm9j1,1578472608.0,I think stand your ground laws apply here so you can just shoot them.
StarWarsLeaks,fdjf7j1,t1_fdikkpo,1578468256.0,"This comic series should be Vader just saying “fuck it” and going off the grid, boozin’ it up in Mos Eisley hot Twilek chicks while making his living off pod racing until an Imperial shuttle lands and tells him he needs to go to the DSII, and seriously, take a shower on the way, the emperor is coming and he’s been asking for you bro.

And then that leads right into the opening scene of ROTJ."
cringe,fdje0hw,t3_elgwr9,1578466892.0,Listening to the “Fedoras are Awesome” song is probably a good approximation of the chaos inside the mind of someone with schizophrenia.
RedHotChiliPeppers,fdj3scj,t1_fdh33pf,1578457679.0,Thanks. Don’t know why I spaced when reading the title.
AskReddit,fdii7yz,t1_fdi1kqm,1578443493.0,I might actually pay a subscription fee for that.
RedHotChiliPeppers,fdgso54,t3_el6jke,1578407312.0,"Casual fan getting more interested in the band here. What song is that? The riff is great.

Also, nice playing."

EverythingScience,fcbdhll,t1_fcaykvi,1577585527.0,"Are there actually articles out there about us going into an ice age in the 70s? And by that I don’t mean articles about us going into an ice age PUBLISHED in the 70s, literally about an ice age starting between 1970 and 1979?"
xbox360,fcasbt2,t1_fcal62u,1577575652.0,Cool. Not my thing but maybe you’ll have a better chance of finding someone if you list that and some other games you’re looking to play.
xbox360,fcaketc,t3_egtcnr,1577570929.0,What games do you play?
qotsa,fc23u54,t1_fc22exd,1577339309.0,"Ok now I remember that. Puts it in a better context and I agree with you. I guess as time went on I forgot details, etc."
