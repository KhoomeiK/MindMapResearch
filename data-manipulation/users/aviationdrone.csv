Worked in a woodshop we had a client who had a shit ton of money and we were making huge raised panel walls out of bird's-eye maple. Thousands of board feet of bird's-eye maple. The guy wanted to make sure every single piece of wood matched the color of adjacent pieces. 
We surfaced the wood and sanded it then we applied the finish they were going to use and we laid it all out on the shop floor then he would come in and look at it and we would rearrange pieces until it look the way he wanted then we had to label every single piece and keep the entire wall in that order the whole time we were doing all the milling so every time we surfaced or sanded we had to re-label each piece so once it was all done every finished piece still had a label on the back so the carpenter could install it in the exact order.

Next step will be to use the same setup with the antenna on the roof, then i'll work on an enclosed setup with a short coax.

Any progress that has been made over the years was just undone in one fell swoop.

I have a son who's a teenager and his attitude is that of not trusting any government and said he's not voting. I'll keep working on him, but for those of you who are 18 (or will be) please go vote.
