fatlogic,ffgdc4r,t3_etbx85,1579903714.0,"I gained 20 lbs recently (I’m 5’ so it’s a lot). I’m just barely in the overweight category but what really got me back on a healthy diet was embarrassment. It’s super embarrassing to be staying with your boyfriend, have a bag packed, and you can’t wear any of it because you can’t get your pants past your thighs. Embarrassment is not a bad thing if it causes you to get on the right track."
fatlogic,ffgcu0z,t3_etgmzb,1579903399.0,I thought it was wonderful when places started doing this. I was honestly shocked to see how many calories are in meals. I’m only 5’ tall which means a lot of places have meals that equal my total daily allowed calories. I really appreciate the information because I can make better choices. I’m not sure why seeing the calories would hurt people that don’t care how much they eat anyway.
fatlogic,ffezs01,t1_ffcvkox,1579871622.0,"Some people need to be upset about something, even if they need to find something to be upset about. I have three cats and one is chunkier than the others cause he likes to hog the food (we’ve been working on his weight and keeping him in a separate room at meal time). I call him fatty on a regular basis. No way I’m going to apologize to his greedy ass."
fatlogic,ff3xm2j,t1_ff36jez,1579551076.0,Children’s clothing *sigh*. Definitely doesn’t help when I’m 5’0 and even the petites clothes aren’t meant for me.
fatlogic,ff1s8ot,t1_ff0q1u9,1579485031.0,I had a big problem with this for awhile. I absolutely hate the idea of wasting food so if I accidentally put too much on my plate I couldn’t not eat it all. I started composting and now I can throw the leftovers in there without feeling as guilty.
fatlogic,fenjadg,t1_femypea,1579285897.0,"I’m in Louisiana and when I went on a vacation to New York City, I remember remarking to my boyfriend that I did not see a single fat person. I guess it’s all the walking and I imagine there are far people (for sure fat tourists) but they must have used alternative forms of transportation cause I didn’t see them."
fatlogic,feninje,t1_fen5nd8,1579285510.0,Holy shit. Is that true? I mean I know there’s a lot of overweight people and also that there are not so many people as small as me (because I’m only 5 feet tall) but I guess I never really paid attention to how many of the people around me weren’t a healthy weight.
fatlogic,fel9117,t3_eppkz7,1579216695.0,So they’re paying (probably a lot) of money just for somebody to tell them it’s ok to be fat? What?
menwritingwomen,fe3af3r,t1_fe2n04z,1578847486.0,"Oh yeah, me too. I developed breasts when I was 12 and they were a C-cup on a smallish frame. Got too much unwanted attention. I was not even into boys yet at that age. I hated it. After college, I lost some weight and it seems I kept it in my breasts because my boobs are quite a bit smaller than when I was younger. Couldn’t be happier to have small breasts."
interestingasfuck,fe31txw,t1_fe2uz69,1578845133.0,What does an orangutan laugh sound like? I don’t know that I’ve heard any laugh outside of human.
fatlogic,fdw2cx7,t1_fdvkwai,1578754292.0,They definition of small portions is warped.
doordash,fdr552g,t3_ems1k2,1578679669.0,I miss dashing. Have some kind of not yet diagnosed neurological condition and haven’t been able to work in a month. It’s cold and rainy today and I just want to get back out there!
fatlogic,fdqypow,t3_emta6s,1578676918.0,"I always wondered where obese children are getting all this food. Well, I mean obviously from their parents, but once the parents realize the children shouldn’t be eating those things why are they in the house. I get my kids treats from time to time, but they don’t have tantrums over cookies because the cookies aren’t there. I don’t keep them in the house, so they don’t ask for them. If the parents eat healthy, so will the children. If all you have for snacks in the house is apples, they’ll eat apples. If you give one kid a cookie of course the other kid is going to be mad about having to eat grapes. Kids don’t have the best self control, so it’s all about what they have access to. I’ve seen so many examples on TV where the parents are yelling at the kids for being fat but keep junk in the house that they are allowed to eat but not the kid which ends up with the kid sneaking food. It shouldn’t be about the kid being fat and needing to be on a diet. It should be about the whole family knowing the importance of having healthy meals b"
fatlogic,fdowt52,t3_emg6ba,1578614674.0,I can’t afford a gym membership. I run outside for free. There’s always some kind of excuse.
fatlogic,fdowod4,t3_emhj5s,1578614585.0,Flexibility doesn’t always equate to cardio health.
fatlogic,fdowjzv,t3_emhm85,1578614505.0,I mean there are a lot of overweight people these days. She just said she was healthier than the other patients. She didn’t say those patients weren’t also overweight.
