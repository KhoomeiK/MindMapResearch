In all seriousness it's just the side effect of Western media always needing a villiain they can pin their problems on so the general public doesn't go after their own governments but instead can be distracted by the big evil country.

Examples include: USSR 1917-1989, Iran 1970's - 1990's with a resurgence since 2017, Iraq 1991 - 2003, North Korea 2000's - Today (less prominent nowadays though), Russia 2010 - Today, China 2015 - Today.

 Eventually they'll find someone else to blame and move on to a different country like how they tried with Cuba and Venezuela, but both proved to be not threatening enough to be made major Villains. 

Of course all these countries have issues and all criticism isn't invalid, but it is in most cases heavily exaggerated (the hundreds of fake news articles on NK that were disproven long ago but persist till today) and highly Hipocritical ( Iran funding terrorists whilst the USA is the world's largest funder of Terrorist organizations)."
