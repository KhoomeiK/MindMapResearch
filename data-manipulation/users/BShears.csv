WaltDisneyWorld,ffha2ui,t3_esyt1e,1579927537.0,Expedition Everest is the single greatest roller coaster I have ever ridden. Carousel of Progress changed my life.

DisneyWorld,ffgasca,t3_etf1bs,1579902150.0,"Obviously this is all my opinion. I’m probably wrong. God knows I’ve been wrong about just about everything else in life. Anyway. 

Eh, screw people that say it’s for kids only. Those are like the folks that call the Super Bowl “sports ball” and Valentine’s Day “single’s awareness day.” Let people enjoy things. Stop yucking other people’s yums. Walt never intended Land to be kids only. It was very specifically for both kids and adults from the start. Check out some of the original attractions and stores for proof. Main Street USA used to have a lingerie store. Ha! Anyway. If you’re worried about posting your trip on FB and getting mocked, maybe stop using FB. It’s a cess pool in and of itself. 

Alright. Cost. Trust me. Most folks cannot afford it. Oh they still go, alright. But it’s on credit. There’s a good friend of mine on here and she posts often. She has that Chase/Visa Disney credit card and is hovering at about $15,000 in debt based on her trips and spending alone. Love ya buddy. 

You’re barely ever going to be in the hotel, so spend as little money as ya can. The worst Disney hotel is better than just about anything else. If you plan on spending lots of time in the room, I recommend a different vacation. 

Lots of people will stay at All Stars or good neighbor but snap a pic by the Contemporary at night for karma here. They know who they are and I love them, never stop. 
 
Costco Travel. Recently did a 7 day stay at All Star with park hopper. $1900 total. Airfare was $750 for two people. A major airline, not spirit. The dining plans are a rip off unless you have money to blow. Might be good if you have kids and want them to be on their own. We spend about $50-75 a day total on food. We split 2-3 kid’s meal and 2 snacks on average per day. We are tiny people and not normal. Get ready for that by the way. You are going to see a lot of America-Sized™ folks in the park. Some are even Florida-Sized people. Get ready to see what they eat. You need to prepare yourself for it. It’s an attraction by itself, no fast pass needed. But, they’re on vacation too and can live their best life without my judgement. Get the resort mug. Total, we spent less $3k. And you can do it cheaper. 4 day no park hop, etc.

Skip table meals and character dining. But you have kids, and for some that can be an attraction in and of itself. 

Also. A lot of the people that post here regularly  live in Florida and near Orlando. They go every week because, well, I’m not a psychiatrist, so your guess is as good as mine. Remember, what you’re seeing posted is the “highlight reel” of their trip. You’re seeing and reading what they cherry-pick to post. Never compare your behind the scene footage to the highlight reel of someone else. 

Go. Have fun. I go every 6-10 years. It’s one of the few “guaranteed” vacations left where you know exactly what you’re getting. I’d say Vegas is similar."
