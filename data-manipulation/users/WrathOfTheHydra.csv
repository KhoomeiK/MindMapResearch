One thing about over-preparing about a game:  I think another important thing to note is that over prep is not waisted if prepped correctly.  If you've made a bunch of details about the town and the party only hits one string of them before leaving, it does helps improving the interactions and elements of what they DO see and informs a more natural story progression, and gives you other options incase the players miss anything big.

It's a group full of people who like to hang out and d&d is sort of the default, more than a 'd&d group'.  I've been looking to find a new group to play with alongside the group I'm in currently because they cover a very social side of the game.  It's also understood by the whole group that we all have our quirks that might be a bit off-putting, but accepting none of us are the perfect d&d player means brushing off the awkward and getting together to play anyway because we want a day out of the week where we can forget our problems and watch the That Guy seduce the neighborhood baker.  No d&d is better than bad d&d, but punishing yourself or others for not 'playing well' also isn't good either, especially since how to play well is subjective.

I still stand by the fact that if new people are trying to dm, having a set story is not a bad thing.  It is important to note that if the players want to leave the confines of your story that they should be able to (I'm guilty of being bad at this), but having a destination for your players can help guide your dming as much as it can guide your players.

I just remember something different about him, but just something I chalked up to being in the background of my sub conscience.  But maybe it was that scent I was picking up?  I have no idea how to feel and I don't have a lot of Parkinsons people I can go sniff willy nill."

It is okay to point out improper grammar.  It's like someone talking with a fake, purposefully-annoying accent, and you are asking them to stop.  Sure, you could technically walk away, but better to point it out at least before walking away so the person is less likely to continue the odd behavior."
