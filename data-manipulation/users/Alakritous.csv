It could just not work but it's something to try."
CatTraining,ffimz3l,t1_ffh5dwz,1579977754.0,Oh God be careful. That stuff is awful and is good at deterring people too. Touch anything that's been sprayed and I guarantee it'll make it to your mouth shortly after. We quit using it because it was killing us and our cat just didn't care.

Dogtraining,ffcgc7v,t3_esskcr,1579798856.0,"It's unfortunate because growling is usually the first sign of ""hey please get away"" and the deaf one obviously can't respond to that. Sounds pretty rough :/

You're doing things right. No matter what happens/improves I would suggest always feeding them separately. It's one safety measure that's not hard to follow through with, and then you never have to worry about sudden food aggression or making the dogs uncomfortable.

I am not a behaviorist... Everything after this is probably things I would carefully try in my own house. But take it as that if you try any of it.

I'd make everything feel as equal as possible while giving them space. Switch up the rooms that are ""theirs"" (today it's your dog's room, the next day or later in the evening it's your gf's dog's) 

I'd think about making your GF do more to care for your dog, and you do more to care for your GFs dog. This one I could see going either way... The dog might be like ""ok, this is how things are now"" or it could make it worse. The science side of me is actually really curious about this one but that's beside the point.

It also could be something where eventually your dog realizes the other dog is deaf and maybe adapt appropriately to that. But that'd be the wishful best-case-scenario, not something you can train.

Best of luck! You sound like great pet parents."

CatTraining,ffcdywt,t3_esiyda,1579797403.0,"People have given you great advice (just don't declaw please...) And I just wanted to say you sound like a great cat owner. Playing with them that much is something a lot of people don't do, and it's so good for them! 

Just add some teeth brushing and you can consider yourself a professional!

Also, I'll always advocate the book Think Like a Cat by Pam Johnson-Bennett. It's amazing and gives true insight into what your cat is actually thinking when they do crazy cat things."

Dogtraining,ff4oyg3,t3_erlc5m,1579568936.0,Food aggression can crop up at any time for any reason. Best solution is to feed separately.

Don't let her look at the cats, don't let her chase them, don't let her sniff them. Immediate redirection. Our boy is getting better every day with ""no kitty."""
dogs,ff4bodl,t1_ff49gr2,1579559846.0,"My main point is we didn't meet this dog or see anything so I don't think it's appropriate to judge. It's not like a dog thinks ""man, going out this window is going to really hurt"" anyway if they've never broken a window before. 

We won't ever know, so I choose to believe in the best case scenario and give people the benefit."

XerathMains,ff3m1i8,t1_ff2kuza,1579543927.0,Your ult gives you the ability to help out bot and top with minimal roaming. So being aware of the map is still important n all that jazz.
dogs,ff3ivta,t1_ff3gsyu,1579541995.0,"Without having seen it I can't begin to diagnose it. Was the dog visibly distressed? How did it act around people? How did it act when it was found? How did it act once it was outside and free?

It could be the dog preferred living outside, it could be the dog just preferred being alone and had a bit more feral demeanor than was typical. The story suggests it was much more comfortable outside/free so I'm just giving them the benefit of the doubt. SA is super common, if they've had a bunch of dogs and only had to let go of that one, they've very likely seen SA and dealt with it successfully."

dogs,ff3fjhm,t1_ff328ci,1579540024.0,"I know a lot about separation anxiety, and without having seen the dog and the behavior being displayed I think it's a bit much to jump to that conclusion. Yes escaping is a symptom, but just as fever is a symptom for multiple different illnesses, escaping is also a variable symptom. Given the adept dog people OP made them sound like, I'd trust them over my own analysis of a description of something over the internet without having seen it or knowing more distinct details."

dogs,ff1v82b,t1_ff1r1re,1579486925.0,"Agreed. We had a greyhound who would resource guard random things at random times that was impossible to guess. But when he did, the 80lb dog would go full out manic. Any other time he was the perfect gentleman, but being unpredictable made him a danger to me and my other pets. First time I was scared of a dog. 

We returned him to the rescue to find he'd been returned for similar reasons before. He ended up living with the owners of the rescue and - by golly - had no issues in their 5 dog household. Very happy for him."
