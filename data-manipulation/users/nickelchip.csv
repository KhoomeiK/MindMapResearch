She said that the machines that were out of the way, **NOT** in a high traffic area, where the ones set to a higher payout percentage. The reasoning was that the machines in a higher traffic area are played the most, so why payout on those machines, if they are going to be played anyways. She also recommended not to play machines that are located on the end of a row. Play the machines towards the middle.  Hope this helps, Good Luck!!!"

sportsbetting,ffb586y,t3_esmaak,1579752124.0," State after state is introducing sports wagering legislation and regulations to either prohibit operators from allowing people with inside information to place bets or punish bettors who use such information. In June, legislation was filed in West Virginia to regulate its Sports Wagering Act. The regulations specifically include the “misuse of inside information” in its definition of “suspicious betting activity.” Pennsylvania has introduced similar regulations in the past year.  

 States such as Indiana, Massachusetts, New York, Tennessee and others use similar language to prohibit or prevent the use of “confidential” or “nonpublic information” when placing a bet on a state-approved athletic competition in legislation they introduced in anticipation of, or after, the Supreme Court order allowing sports betting. New Jersey has gone one step further. It introduced emergency sports regulations, using a verbatim definition from the West Virginia bill, to curb insider betting. The same language appears in New Jersey’s proposed rules for permanent adaptation. 

 And at the federal level, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) co-sponsored and introduced legislation in December 2018 that, if passed, would federally regulate sports gambling and make it unlawful for a person to place or accept a bet on the basis of “material nonpublic information.” This language is nearly identical to rules that govern insider trading as it applies to securities. 

Now with all that said, Insider Trading is incredibly hard to prove. Almost all the proof that is required to prove insider trading is circumstantial.  Let's say you known for a fact that the star basketball player from, The University of Widgets, broke his ankle 3 hours before gametime, and you then went and put $1k on the Widgets Opponent before the line changed, is that illegal? Yes, but could they prove you knew his ankle was broke? The $1k bet looks suspicious as hell but doesn't establish guilt. Like anything in life just be smart about how you go about matters and you'll be alright."

Wouldn't go too crazy on it though simply because KC is expecting him to get a lot of touches, so their shitty run defense may be ready for him to a point."

Getting started will depend a lot on where you are located country wise and if in the US state wise. Some states are amazingly more simple than others as each state has its own regulations.

Some suggestions for you, would to find other small time producers who got started on their own and go talk to them and ask questions. You'll be surprised how many people will be willing to help with information. Maybe even try to find a job or volunteer with some of them, that way you can learn from your mistakes on someone else's dime.

Do as much research you can, where to find equipment, how to distribute your product, how much money you will need, etc.. etc..., there oogles and oogles of questions. Keep positive, If you do something you love, you'll never work a day in your life."
bengals,feumpl3,t3_eqken0,1579387957.0,"I don't think it's so much its the Media  trying to tear down Joe Burrow as they are going after  Mike Brown the owners of the Bengals. The Bengals owner has been a notorious cheap skate in his management of the franchise, and I believe the league and other NFL franchise owners are using the media to 'attack' Mike Brown. I wrote a article that said basically said that the NFL has a problem,  that they don't want to talk about:  

There are 8 teams, 25% of the NFL that have NOT won a playoff game in a minimum of 14 years. Bengals, Browns, Bills, Bucs, Lions, Dolphins, Redskins, Raiders. 7 of these 8 teams have been working towards getting to the playoffs to get a win, results are varying but they are trying.

The only exception is the Bengals, and they haven't done squat. Sure they hired a new head coach but then had a worse record. I have a feeling the NFL and the other 31 owners are going to start pressuring the Brown family to step it up. With the Bengals getting Burrow, the time for excuses is over. The owners don't want the Bengals to continue reflecting negatively on the entire league no more than they already have. The owners have applied the heat to the Bengals in the past and the Bengals got back to the playoffs within the next 2 years."

Won't let you check inventory at several stores at once, you have to check each store individually. The whole thing is half assed backwards.

When you go into the store their computer system looks like the one from the 1983 movie War Games. I'm not kidding either. A Tickle me Elmo doll is more advanced than Lowes store computer.

bengals,fepv00t,t3_eq5t1q,1579332270.0," Every pick in the NFL draft from No. 1 to the final overall selection have their salaries pre-determined by what order they are taken.  This includes the total value of each player’s contract, their signing bonus and also the cap hit which the team absorbs. Beyond that, all deals are over four years, but first-round picks have a fifth-year option available to teams. 

Long story short, Joe Burrow will get paid the most of all the players drafted this year if he's taken #1 which happens to be the Bengals this year. Logically you are going to want to work at the place that pays you the most for doing the same job."

It's going to be 22 F at gametime, which doesn't lend itself to a lot of scoring. Tennessee will run the ball in an attempt to chew up the clock, to keep the ball from Mahomes.
