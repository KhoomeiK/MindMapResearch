Generally transitioning might include changing a style of dress or general self presentation, changing a name and/or pronouns, or changing the way they speak or behave. Just behaving outside of gender norms doesn’t make someone non-binary - it’s about how you see yourself, just like with binary people.

I think non-binary people are in a tough spot because lots of people have never met a trans person, much less a non-binary trans person, and exposure is what leads most to acceptance. Instead people imagine what they must be like based off of cherry picked online personas and stereotypes, and reduce their identity to an accessory or dismiss it as attention-seeking behavior. Your identity is (I assume) tied to being cisgender, but no one accuses you of trying to replace your personality with this.

I’m not really the best person to speak on this, not being trans or even as educated as I could be on these issues, but your comment rubbed me the wrong way."

It’s not as if all these cows are sitting around waiting to be milked, so we may as well milk them. We breed them in massive numbers, impregnate them constantly and remove the calves so we can have their milk, and then slaughter them only a few years into their lives at most.

We breed millions of them into existence each year for the purpose of slaughter, how is stopping this a crueler alternative? There is nothing inherently good about how we have created the modern cow and chicken. The modern chicken is a genetic mess that either produces more eggs than its body can handle or is grounded by the weight of its own oversized breasts weeks into its life."
