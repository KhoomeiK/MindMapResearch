i googled this and got a lot of info on it sketch fab stuff being stolen. Nothing about china specifically but i mean, its a difficult thing to prove that a chinese person or company stole something for resale in the west when they resell shit on an english website. Maybe with enough digging you could prove it, but i only care so much."
