therapy,ffcruoq,t3_esmk4w,1579805968.0,"First off, I'm sorry for your struggles. It's all too relatable for me. I spend a lot of time just procrastinating everything I do, because I can't focus, I can't stop thinking, my brain just won't turn off, but nor will it FUNCTION.

But since you've come here and told us all these things, because we are strangers and it's easier to say to the internet, this is exactly the type of wording you need to use with your therapist in order for therapy to be useful. If we aren't honest with them, they can't help us.

I agree with u/bigsquidsociety that you should just show her this post. I also think it's ok if you find that one therapist is too difficult to talk to, and try others. Finding a solution isn't easy but trying more than one way to get to it is not failure, or a bad thing."

I've read that some of these conditions actually cause the cravings because of shortages in dopamine in the brain. It's basically a management game for me, but I have to be careful when I ease into keto and fasting because negating the brain fog as you go off of a carby lifestyle is excruciating at first."
fasting,ff6h38h,t3_ersnm2,1579627057.0,"I'm female, 5'3"", and have done keto on and off for about 3 years. To start with, I generally fast 18-20 hours, and have anywhere from 6 to 4 hours of an eating window.

Fasting is how I realized I probably have a bit of a binge eating disorder. Now it's not out of control, but I can demolish more than is healthy in one sitting and I always thought it was just because of carbs. I think that's just one part of it. Keto helped me control my hunger. Then I found IF.

I'm fairly good at keeping to a plan IF I have a plan. So if I fast and I don't have meals planned around it, I will binge. If I understand myself going into it, then coming out of it eat something healthy and filling, and learn to listen to my body when I have an off day and just can't force the fast to continue (I am cranky, can't think, or just restless), then I break the fast and go back to my keto foods.

The hardest part is changing my mindset that it's okay to eat healthy foods until I am full, and should not just say 'Fuck it it's a cheat day', because then it's far easier to let that blip go and get back on track.

It's given me order in the disorder, but I know that it's also unearthed my tendency to view sweets as 'now or never', which is a terrible mentality to have.

Yesterday my friend tempted me with ice-cream on the way home. Because I've been sticking to keto while fasting, I was able to flat out reject it before she even finished speaking (We were pulling up to a drivethru because SHE wanted ice cream). I went home and made chicken, bacon, and green beans, and had berries and a low carb muffin for dessert.

Had I been fasting and not watching my carbs, I absolutely would have eaten a double dip, gone home and munched on anything I could get my hands on, and felt lots of shame."

I would make a list, and whether you use an app or just a notepad, keep track of it every day to see if you are meeting your goals.

For example, my list is something like:

Don't nitpick everything

Be positive

Listen Actively (Be present)

Don't overexplain yourself (I have ADHD)

Don't complain (It's ok to dislike something but don't fuss)

Take the time you need, but it might be better to tell him you just need time to figure out how to handle all of your emotions. I think the only thing rude you are doing here is not being up front about how you feel. If you give him that information, then the ball is in his court to respect you and your feelings.

Cordwaining,feajggh,t1_fe9z46l,1578949584.0,"Hey, popping in here as a cosplayer (since '98) to say I love your enthusiasm! I like to make shoes too, but I agree that a cover that you sew down to the shoe would be the best way to go about this. Even if you totally got a pair of sneakers just for the sole, and butchered the rest! This is what I like to do and you can make it COMPLETELY believable that it is the way the shoe was made.

*What you want to do is find a pair of shoes with the shape you want, and gut them. Take off any pieces that are in the way on the outside (Laces, belts, etc) and put the shoe on barebones. 

*Now tape some plastic bags around it until you've made a super tight cover of the shoe.

*Use a sharpie to mark the bottom edge where the shoe meets the sole (on your tape pattern). Also draw any seam lines you'd like to make for example, that zipper that goes down the front of the shoe.

*Now cut the whole thing off of your shoe (carefully!) and re-trace your pattern (minus the parts you don't want, such as what had overlaped the sole) onto some scrap fabric.

*Now you can tape those pieces back onto the shoe to be sure it all lines up how you want. This is where you can make adjustments to the way things look. Adjust your pattern as many times as you need to.

*Now take your pattern pieces, add seam allowances, and construct the cover to your shoe as if it were going to be a shoe all on its own.

*When it's complete, set it on top of your base shoe, and pin everything down tight. Does everything match? Good.

*Here is where you can do something optional: I like to sew a 'fake seam' along the very bottom of the shoe. This works as an optical illusion once you attach it to the base shoe.

*Now put the shoe cover back on your shoes and pin them in place again. Be sure to stick straight pins all along the sole so that everything lines up.

*You can get a uphostery/carpet needle and hand sew this to the base shoe. It should be noted, the thinner your base shoe, the easier it will be to attach the cover. Use a back-stitch and follow the 'fake seam' to attach it to the shoes.

It's very backwards from making a shoe from scratch, and you're limited by a lot of reach (fitting your hand inside is a real bitch tbh), but a pair of pliers will help you a lot. Also silicone finger grips (in the hand sewing/needlepoint supplies).

DecidingToBeBetter,fdpyqb8,t3_emo2sq,1578646336.0,"This happened to me when I had to speak to my English class classmates over a book report. I got shakier and shakier and eventually broke down crying. I think it's normal if you have anxiety. It's not about not knowing the subject matter, but rather not being prepared to have all those eyes on you. The same thing will happen to me when I try to do something I know very well in front of people, and suddenly my mind goes blank.

It has taken me years, but the only thing that makes it easier is repetition. Start with smaller groups, give your speech to just one friend. Then try adding one of their friends and speak to them, too. Try to do other little things that make you nervous but are not too taxing, to build your tolerance too.

For example, my hobby is anime and I go to convention events for it. Many people volunteer to present a panel on topics so that attendees have things to do. My friends ran a small convention and I decided to try and give a presentation on how to make costume props out of craft foam. I knew it very well and made all the supply kits, but I didn't prepare very well or practice with showing friends, and my memory under stress tends to dissipate. So when it came time to do it, I did get very shaky and stuttered quite a bit. I did pull off the event though, and had about 10 attendees who enjoyed it.

That made me feel a little more prepared, and the next year, I did another presentation on sewing, and this time my friend came with me, to prompt me when I became stuck, because she lives with me and knows the topic well enough to help me figure out what to say.

I felt a little better about that one, but still stuttered.

I found it easier to begin doing panels/presentations called 'swap meet' where the most talking I did was to explain the rules to attendees (it's basically a meet-and-trade your old collectibles), because it's less talking all the time, but now that I've done a few of these it's gotten much easier because I've said the same things each time. Now I feel like I could do a more difficult subject like the ones I tried to the first time.

You just have to not give up, and try new ways to speak and approach a crowd, even with a friend perhaps, until you wear off those nerves by teaching your brain it's going to be okay."

You sound like you don't even want to give the gift, like it's an obligation or something.

The gift giving is an action showing a gesture of appreciation. If you don't appreciate them for the full worth of the gift (which is theirs once it's given - to use or sell or toss), then don't give it. And that's perfectly fine to have a set amount you're not willing to go over for friends. I only go over budget when a good friend REALLY wants an item and I'm wanting to do something special for them.

If you want it to be appreciated and want to give it, first find out if it's even something they want. A good gift is given knowing something about the recipient. I can't tell you how many times I've had to figure out how to use a subway gift card I don't want. But I wouldn't give it back to the giver, because I appreciated the gesture on some level."

I like Keto because I feel fuller faster, picking foods with slightly higher fat content for satiety, but fat in the keto diet is not actually a goal to be met. Whatever you don't eat in fat or caloric intake, your body will burn up for energy instead.

Keto just makes it easier to remain in a state of depleted glucose, so your body switches to using ketones for fuel instead. Ketones are created by breaking down the fat for energy.

I may have ships I don't like, but more often than not, I'll have enough variance in my ship preferences that I can list at least 5 for any given series.

For example, I recently was talking about how in Star Wars, I ship ReyLo, but before that I also shipped Rey/Poe, Rey/Finn, Poe/Finn, Han/Leia, Luke/Leia, Luke/Leia/Han, started considering Kylo/Hux, wondering what would happen if Rose got attached to literally anybody else (lol I'm just not terribly fond of her development), and the latest movie has given me even more characters to consider.

I rarely write fic but I do RP a LOT. I get a lot of fic ideas that I never seem to have time to write because I'm RPing instead. But that provides me an outlet for SO many what-ifs, and it's very fun! Especially when sometimes you just toss names in a hat, see who runs into who, pick a scenario, and see what happens!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,fddzgcc,t3_ekv7kq,1578327699.0,"If you're trying to get by with what you can stomach, get healthier, and save money, you could just do black coffee and intermittent fast - basically just skip breakfast, and don't skimp on the quality of your other meals (cut down sugar, eat enough protein and green veggies, healthy fats) so that your body doesn't swing into low blood sugar as easily.

It wouldn't really be much different than people saying 'I don't eat after 8pm' or such, except you're having 'breakfast' (breaking fast) later in the day."

NoStupidQuestions,fddxv94,t1_fddxh2o,1578326622.0,"If you squeeze a bag full of air by sitting on it, you put enough force to push air out of both ends. Your body is pretty compacted, and all that 25 feet is rolled up inside you, so rolling over is going to shift things. It's just a simultaneous conicidence, because the pressure of your muscles and other things in there push in various directions all at the same time.

Just because you can sneeze and accidentally pee a little doesn't mean the force would also push pee out of your nose."

Honestly, a label doesn't matter too much in the end, it's that you've got to become accustomed to not giving a fuck what other people think about you. And it's okay also if things change.

You won't discover what works best for you if you don't experiment. If that means wearing different hats and trying new things, even just for a day, go for it! There are so many different factors that go into what the people around you have going for how/why/when they figure things out. The people around them, who raised them, friends, social status, exposure to opportunities, personality, etc.

You're unique and that's ok. It's ok to question yourself, but don't spend all your energy and time on it going in circles because you'll just get exhausted and sad."

Willing to seed what I can, I'll try to clear up some space! To seed, you just keep the torrent open so you can keep sharing, right? I'm kinda dumb about torrenting, I always assumed it meant that after I download I just keep it on so it keeps uploading constantly for other people. If there's more to it when the file is so large I may not have space, how would I seed only some of it?"

FanFiction,fcy5h6l,t1_fcxk9dk,1578075119.0,"I can only speak for myself as a Reylo, but here's how I feel about things:

I liked all those ships (except any with Rose, I found her character flat). 

I liked Rey and Finn

I liked Finn and Poe

I liked Poe and Rey

I liked Rey and Kylo

My reasons for each of them is different, but when it comes to Reylo, I'm with OP in at least that I LIKE that it's dysfunctional, and I would hate to read an OOC Kylo in a fic. That's kinda why I haven't sought any out, despite wanting to read it. But I like messy ships that get really complicated, where just because there is sexual tension doesn't mean everything is going to be fluffy and good.
