roosterteeth,fff7789,t1_ffezzkh,1579877452.0,I like the podcast where Blaine rips into him for sounding like a moron. The way he can’t form a sentence without stuttering or saying some very odd or stupid thing gets aggravating. They have him on the podcast to laugh at whatever dumb thing he has to say.

LPOTL,fepgq4v,t3_eq7h77,1579320062.0,Not with the main show. I don’t listen to ben’s side projects after an Abe Lincoln’s top hat where he completely misinterpreted an article stating that the government blew up a plane on 9/11. The next episode he didn’t apologize but just said no one saw what happened. He ignores th black box evidence and takes away what those passengers did. Pissed me off and I don’t listen to his crap as a result.
todayilearned,fep6hyg,t1_feoidm3,1579313228.0,He also was probably tied in with people who knew how to make a very large but relatively simple bomb. It’s why he was seen with another identified male prior to the bombing and there were ties to racists pricks like those in Elohim city.

BlackPeopleTwitter,felrsse,t3_epquqy,1579229355.0,I understand that movie theaters charge too much for food. But that’s where they make their money. It’s why I usually just get a soda and some candy because otherwise there won’t be a movie theater. But then my girl brings candy from cvs and i eat that with my guilt candy.

TwoBestFriendsPlay,fegg8rp,t1_feg18pj,1579091740.0,"Eh, monarch seemed pretty incompetent for most of the show. He doesn’t seem to be smart or have an understanding of most things. His lair was a flying cocoon for god sakes."
SquaredCircle,fefil1b,t1_feelul8,1579057074.0,No idea why I’m being down voted. This could be a family or those people with the sign could hawked a kid for a fun photo.

When new day was first formed he walked up to Korea and asked why he was wasting his time with the new young guys. After new day came into their own he walked up and apologized because he couldn’t see their vision.
