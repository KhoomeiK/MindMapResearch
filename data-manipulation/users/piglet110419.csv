Let’s call her Jennifer. Jennifer is 37. Has 5 children ranging from 6-16. 3 different fathers. She gets almost $500 weekly in child support.        She gets close to $1000 in food stamps and rental assistance/ her “portion” is  $198 of the $900 ( includes all utilities). She obviously gets medical assistance. 

Jennifer hasn’t worked since 2001- she thinks it’s FUNNY.   She has a car her parents bought her.  She TELLS people she doesn’t want to work. Now her thing is “Fibromyalgia” when I told her I hoped she was ok her reply? “ oh I’m fine I want to get Disability...won’t get child support forever”.

I wanted to kick her. Oh and I know for a fact she abuses pills because CPS contacted us about her overdosing 2 nights in a row.
