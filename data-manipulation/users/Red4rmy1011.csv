UMD,fc1u3sy,t1_fc1m0ln,1577329764.0,"I am going to stand firm on my statement as to 250. It is a bad intro to proofs course, and a bad intro to combinatorics, and a bad intro to number theory course stuck into one giant clusterfuck of a class. To be clear I'm not mad about it, I got a 100% in the course (just to flex a little bit for fun 🙃), but I learned more about proofs from reading my GFs Drexel intro proofs class and playing around with solving the combinatorics problems [here, (fair warning these are hard but the guys lecture notes are awesome)](https://www.cip.ifi.lmu.de/~grinberg/t/19fco/index.html). Further ENEE 324 is a much better intro to statistics theory course than 400 and 250 (and maybe 410
though ive not taken 410).

Further, if you think it sounds cliquey that was almost the intent, almost. The reality is that yes, people should have access to theory, if they want to, but that should not inform our decisions as to the depth and dificulty of the theory courses (which by the way, are damn easy at least comparing to my friends at various other universities, particularly in the mandatory CS track). This is what has happened to 250 that has made it a bad course. It should be 3 seperate courses alongside 131, 132, and 216, but instead its all rushed in in one semester. It is unacceptable that the only reason I'm even half competent at rigorous mathematics is because my gf shares course material from another university with me. I'm also high on changing the structure, purpose, and languages of 131, 132 and 216 but that is a seperate point for a seperate day.

You are right that you do not _have_ to prove anything in 351 (well with teli you do some lower bound proofs using decision tree arguments which is awesome, but I digress) but I've found that not only when I hold office hours in a proofs based way do people better understand the material, I myself succeeded in the course by at least mentally proving answers to myself on exams. As to whether it should be a proofs (or at least a partially handwavy proofs) based course see my point about swapping over 451 content into 351. 451 is much more a proofs based course and I believe it is better for it. Further IMO that is the theory that is better for people who couldn't care less about theory (of which, there are a lot) to learn. 

As you can probably tell this is also quite important to me and I am willing to die on the hill that theoretical CS at this school is hampered by its desire (or apparent desire) to not have a theory light version of the major. This also feeds into the absurdity of the size of the 351 curve but again, a different djscussion for a different day."
UMD,fc0p3am,t1_fc09fzp,1577296294.0,"Alright, as someone in the same shoes as the ""95%"" you are bashing let me tell you something about every one of my colleagues: we care about our students. But you are right, 351 does have a serious problem, and its not the TAs, or even Kruskal's fault. If you note, our (Teli's) class average was not all that much better, and after 3 semesters of TAing the course I can tell you with some degree of certainty that I know what that problem is. Lets break it into multiple parts:

1. **A lack of a mathematical base**: ok, so I don't mean to offend any 250 TAs/instructors, but to me CMSC250 is a garbage course that does not properly prepare students for theoretical computer science (which 351 very clearly is). There is not enough of an emphasis on rigorous mathematical proofs, nor on combinatorics of discrete structures and probability, all of which ends up being pretty core to the analysis of algorithmic runtime. STAT400 also fails its students spectacularly when it comes to probability and combinatorics. In general, algorithms is a _hard_ course for a lot of students because they simply come in underequiped to deal with the mathiness. Under this I'll also put the fact that many people lose points simply due to math mistakes which we always try to mitigate by making the final answer worth less than the work but alas, we cant make it worth 0 points as much as I would love that. 

2. **A dichotomy in student interest**: Now this one will sound like I'm victim blaming, but I am not, the point I'm trying to make is that the system is flawed. Now with that disclaimer done, the fact is that many (if not most) of the students I have interacted with, do not care much for theoretical computer science. I get that, it can be dry, boring, and math heavy so if cool combinatorics facts don't pique your interest, you probably won't want to know how to do the dry stuff we do in 351. This is OK. But the fact of the matter is, UMD CS is 2 majors stuck together. Some students (myself included) are interested in Computer Science as it can be viewed as a branch of mathematics first, and engineering second. However, the majority view it the other way around, and for simplicity, I will now call these two groups CS, and SWE, for ease. The two are, imo, quite different in what courses they should be taught and what they focus on, and both are being failed. SWE does not particularly need theoretical analysis in their toolkit as much as they need more practical design courses. CS needs more theory earlier than what is provided in a junior level course on basic analysis. A corollary of this is:

3. **Analysis before design**: I'm sure my students have heard me say this in the past but: 451 content should be swapped with 351. Not only is 451 content more interesting and useful imo, it just makes some sense to me that we should teach all of our students the design like DP, Divide and Conquer, greedy, etc. and focus analysis on purely asymptotic bound before we give them more advanced analysis techniques.

4. **Rising student:TA ratio**: This one is self explanatory. We had almost 30 students per TA this semseter. This is projected to get worse before it gets better (thank you LEP status, but eh). The sheer scale of the class means that I feel we needed to have 2 head TAs to be comfortable (I don't know how Jamie does it). This workload (plus the fact that we are all still students, some undergrad with our own classes to worry about) also leaves little time to dedicate to class improvements. I can say for certain that many of the undergrad TAs regularly work more than the max 10 hours a week, and I am currently working on a major QOL improvement for our gradescope integration, on my own time. We need more TAs, more faculty, but that is an admin problem neither of us can solve. 

5. **A lack of Discussions**: This one is also self explanatory. We need discussions and I'd imagine every single one of those ""lazy"" TAs would agree. Something something @admin pls.

I could go on but I want to go work on scraping Gradescope some more (why cant we have an API like civilized people). In conclusion, the CS major is structurally flawed in several ways,  and while we TAs are human and make mistakes, we (along with Kruskal and Teli) are not out to to get people, as much as you want us lynched for our apparent crimes against CS students. If you made it through this essay and are still mad, feel free to berate me, but thanks for the kick I needed to finally roughly format this.

Edit: further, yes I am biased, but I actually enjoyed Kruskal's lecturing style more than I liked Teli's (I'm sorry :( I still think both are pretty good). But my position is rarely the popular one, I like Mark Shayman's lectures and cant handle Lawson and Anwar so there is that."
PrequelMemes,fc0iqik,t1_fc0ej04,1577291728.0,I think my point can be summarized by the fact that the gun (Finn's force sensitivity) is relevant to the wider universe and I care more for the world building than for individual characters. And in that sense the gun never has to go off to have a purpose.
PrequelMemes,fc0d75c,t1_fc0bu6i,1577287506.0,"I clearly enjoy star wars for a different reason than you. When I look at the story of even the OT its really just 1 family's problems playing out at galactic scale, I don't find it super interesting. The part I like is the world building, the jedi and the force as a mystical power in the universe. This movie expanded the new cannon knowledge of the force, the sith, and put Palpatine actually into the pantheon of sith lords who have a clearly shown massive amount of power.

Maybe that makes me a ""bad"" fan but hey, you are free to that opinion."
PrequelMemes,fc0bhzn,t1_fc0awfr,1577285949.0,"See, I didn't think it was a popcorn movie and that might be our disconnect. I thought it tied up almost every loose end in a way that wasn't universally final but definitely satisfying and told you something about the universe or the characters. Finn's force sensitivity is clear from the movie and that, to me, is good enough.

Plus regarding the Chekhov's gun, I don't actually like that concept. This is obviously my personal preference but I actually like stories where the obvious gun on the mantlepeice is never fired, but still plays a more subtle part in the stories final act, which I think Finn does well. 

Anyway, don't take this as an affront since I clearly have ""wrong"" ideas about storytelling and am definitely not trained in anything related to writing as the last english class I took that actually involved creative writing was in high school"
PrequelMemes,fc09xul,t1_fc0832k,1577284433.0,"I don't get this mentality. (Disclaimer I really liked Rise, probably is 3rd best movie in my book).

Starwars at its core is about mystical space wizards and its _ok_ to not have that explained explicitly. I think its actually better to not hit the audience over the head with that kind of thing and let them infer from the details. Its like the whole battle meditation theories about the deathstar battles, its not stated but given the other content we have about the universe it fits nicely and, at least to me, is satisfying world building."
politics,fby46a2,t1_fbxzek8,1577207663.0,"Your assumption on batteries is a little flawed as really their primary purpose would be effectively a giant flywheel to dampen high frequency effects in consumption, not store electricity long term. Further, we have already provided a non-chemical, non-nuclear solution to that problem (as well as storage actually in this case) and that's pumped hydroelectric power. This is already being used to good effect in several parts of the world and is surprisingly (or unsurprisingly if you are trained in electrical engineering) more efficient than chemical batteries. 

Basically, to me it doesn't make sense to fall back on nuclear where we don't have to, and in a lot of cases we dont have to. Imo nuclear power is a good first powerplant for the bootstrapping step of sustainable infrastructure development like is being done in some under developed areas of the globe, and in a more extreme sense, off planet infrastructure."
