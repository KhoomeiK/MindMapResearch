NSFWIAMA,fctmces,t1_fctl6e6,1577948756.0,Walk away from whatever I was doing or find someone to talk to lol. Just change the scenery a bit
NSFWIAMA,fctmb04,t1_fctl5we,1577948707.0,"I have yet to notice a difference for myself, but that’s awesome!"
depression,fctlbqx,t1_fct8uzp,1577947523.0,Unless I’m not remembering correctly it wasn’t normal for me to think of suicide at all let alone this frequency until this year.
NSFWIAMA,fctl2tr,t1_fctl0tf,1577947224.0,Absolutely! And the frustration usually concludes with me feeling shitty or unattractive/undesirable I just try to distract myself so that doesn’t happen
NSFWIAMA,fctkzqr,t1_fctkrb1,1577947125.0,Kind of a weird sensation
NSFWIAMA,fctkz99,t1_fctkpxe,1577947110.0,Living life lol. I think I just channeled it into everything else. It was weird the first few months now it feels normal
NSFWIAMA,fctkxzm,t1_fctknww,1577947068.0,Going with the flow I suppose. I’m not a hook up kind of person so I am a little pickier than someone in a dry spell should be lol
NSFWIAMA,fctkwi3,t1_fctkjox,1577947019.0,How long did it take for you to be okay with it?
NSFWIAMA,fctkw1g,t1_fctkjvk,1577947003.0,I’ve just always masturbated often. I don’t think it’s more or less because of this though
depression,fctkutj,t3_eikclj,1577946962.0,"I am so so sorry. I lost mine 6 years ago and in some ways it still feels like yesterday. Just be gentle with yourself, it’s okay to go through a range of emotions when you’re struggling with a loss like that. I beat myself up for laughing a lot of the time, but after a while I realized that she would want me to laugh and find ways to live and celebrate in her memory."
NSFWIAMA,fctkia3,t1_fctkf3u,1577946567.0,I’m trying to see the good in it hah. How’s yours goin?
NSFWIAMA,fctkh88,t1_fctkf6m,1577946534.0,"Oh absolutely, I feel mine might turn into that. I’m just not into hook up culture at all and haven’t settled into a relationship in a long while"
NSFWIAMA,fctkeg4,t1_fctkdg9,1577946445.0,Thanks lmao
NSFWIAMA,fctkc69,t1_fctk9vv,1577946377.0,"Kinda, this is just the longest it’s been. Closer to two years at this point- yikes"
depression,fc4eqge,t1_fc4b0x7,1577414530.0,"I try to go outside and walk around somewhere green. If I can't get out of bed or out the door, I try to find something around my house I've been meaning to do or look at photos/videos of places I want to go. It gives me a little hope."
depression,fc4efto,t3_cml6ni,1577414290.0,"I'm currently finding that this is one of the only places/ways I feel comfortable talking about my feelings right now, or about my state in general. I am having some serious suicidal ideations. I don't think I will act on them though. I love my family so much it hurts and they have gone through too much loss already. I just feel so alone right now. My sisters are really close together and it feels like such a lovefest between them and then I view myself as the fat annoying one that nobody wants around. I think one of them is going to help me schedule a therapy appointment sometime within this next week but I don't know. I just am so unhappy it's scaring me. I actually almost didn't post this just now because I felt that I was being too whiny or a burden to the post (?) no clue how or why that would happen. I hope you all are doing okay, thank you for creating this space. <3"
depression,fbwqyq9,t3_cml6ni,1577157101.0,"I checked in yesterday but I’m going to again. I’m afraid to tell those who love me how I feel because it’s been constant over the last few months and I think they’re sick of hearing it. It really hurts and I know they want me to be around them like my old self but I can’t do it and don’t want to let them down anymore. 
Tomorrow is my deceased mother’s birthday and I miss her so much. I know I could have talked to her about this stuff."
