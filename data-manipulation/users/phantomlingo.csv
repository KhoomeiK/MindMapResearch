DebateEvolution,fe10jw2,t1_fe0y3xx,1578821132.0,"That’s where the idea of multiple deities and the battle between good and evil comes in. There are religions with the belief that there is not an “all powerful” god, just one that is good. They argue he cannot be both - if he were all powerful then he’s the one who created these trials for us and is therefore not good, and if he is good he would not have created trials so he must not be all powerful.

So their deity has our best interests in mind but has to constantly battle evil and cannot protect us fully from these other beings. Like the story of the demon banished beneath the earth who entered into the fangs of vipers to harm us.

This doesn’t have much to do with the topic but I’ve been doing too much reading lately so yeah do with this what you will."
