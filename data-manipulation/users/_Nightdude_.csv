Sure, you lose your account for whatever reason, go make a new one and get back to where you were. But that's not a smurf, that's just some guy on his new main trying to get back to where he was before. Pros playing on an alt account that's not far away from their main to avoid being followed too closely, that's fine.

Well golly jee, how is smurfing even the solution? Those games where you pick SF mid on your mid archon account and stomp everyone in the game while going 22-0 how is that even actual dota? It's not. Might as well be playing against easy bots at least you won't ruin their time."

DotA2,febieco,t3_eoc6hf,1578959162.0,"What's not to like? He has amazing range and trades really well in lane because of that and because of headshot.

AOE slow that gives vision over an area, that also makes it very easy for him to double or even triple stack camps(look, if you're dire, he can easily aggro both shrine camps with right clicks and shrapnel a third to stack); and since he'll have won your lane by the time he begins stacking, there won't be any danger to you.

Not only that, he gets cooldown reduction at level 10. You know what that means? That aoe slow, is now always up. Glimmer capes left and right, force staffs his carry to safety 3 times in a single fight.

Same goes for counterinitiators as well. How often do you have an Axe on your team that's always fucking showing on the map cause he **NEEDS TO SPIN THROUGH THOSE CREEPWAVES** even though his carry is trying to farm it as well.
Instead our red friend could be smart.

No, I would even love to have role queue options for unranked so I can practice a role/hero without putting my mmr on the line. If you try to play mid in unranked you have to win roll, that is if you get lucky and the other(s) even roll.

DotA2,febieco,t3_eoc6hf,1578959162.0,"What's not to like? He has amazing range and trades really well in lane because of that and because of headshot.

AOE slow that gives vision over an area, that also makes it very easy for him to double or even triple stack camps(look, if you're dire, he can easily aggro both shrine camps with right clicks and shrapnel a third to stack); and since he'll have won your lane by the time he begins stacking, there won't be any danger to you.

Not only that, he gets cooldown reduction at level 10. You know what that means? That aoe slow, is now always up. Glimmer capes left and right, force staffs his carry to safety 3 times in a single fight.

And I am convinced one of the main reasons for it is that I used to refuse to join stupid fights as a core. If my team fucking threw themselves at the enemy team, in the middle of the map over no objective whatsoever, I'd just let them die unless it was obvious I'd be able to clean up. 

And I bet I got reported through this a lot, by people selecting comm abuse or everything (usually everything).

Ofc it's even better when you can take a camp or two while babysitting.

Same goes for counterinitiators as well. How often do you have an Axe on your team that's always fucking showing on the map cause he **NEEDS TO SPIN THROUGH THOSE CREEPWAVES** even though his carry is trying to farm it as well.
Instead our red friend could be smart. Hiding nearby while spinning through some neutrals, look, that way he even gets to gut innocent animals that were just trying to get through the day AND he gets to jump in and get calls left and right, or the enemy is too scared to do anything cause FISTS is missing."
