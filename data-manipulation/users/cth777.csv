nfl,ffc4rmn,t1_ffc33xc,1579791506.0,"Brady and brees got off to slow starts, sure, but they are in a different universe of talent. Brady doesn’t count though because he was willing to take less money to help win (theoretically). Rivers never won a super bowl but was definitely a better QB and was on excellent chargers teams; however, as you said, no Super Bowl. I would say that all of the QBs you mentioned SHOULD have made more. They just didn’t because the giants were willing to overpay.

Also, if you want to follow the 2A that protects citizens rights to bear arms to defend against the government, why are we limiting any high capacity guns?
