iamverybadass,ffdkadn,t3_eswc68,1579822674.0,Antagonizing little kids and then posting the results online for karma and internet strangers to laugh at. Neat
hardware,ffbik5a,t1_ffbh3fx,1579766939.0,It makes just as much sense to prioritize revenue as to prioritize not peddling endless amounts of vapid tech consumerism that makes an early retirement an attractive way out.
gaming,ffbd34a,t1_ffayolr,1579760263.0,"If Valve didn’t introduce hats and created the in-game hat economy, TF2 would’ve arguably died a long time ago. You can install a mod to remove hats and all other cosmetics if they really bother you that much."
gaming,ffb1zgk,t1_ffay5k6,1579749781.0,"By that logic, offering anything for sale to consumers is predatory because they might want something and they’ll have to spend money to get it. Sometimes people just have to exercise self restraint. Making something illegal for everyone just because a minority take it too far is the wrong way to go about it."

gaming,ffaxhj1,t1_ffax0nl,1579746767.0,Can you explain in what way? TF2 hats are purely cosmetic. Everything else is unlockable by playing the game.
gaming,ffavssh,t1_ffavcgy,1579745646.0,Because hats are only for looks. They are not the same thing as the microtransactions the community tends to hate
