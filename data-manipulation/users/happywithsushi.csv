nevertellmetheodds,ffp2sy8,t1_ffoxoxd,1580085077.0,"It honestly just seemed like miscommunication. They agreed to have sex but she didn't know he was into strangulation and wasn't ok with it in the end. She claimed that she asked him to stop but then later said she didn't actually say anything until he asked to cum on her face and she said no, so he didn't. I feel for both of them to be honest. He even came out and said that he sees things from her point of view and will learn from it and it seems like he did. Idk. I don't know either of those people, just my take on the situation."

They even proved they weren't on sedatives by having the animals chase something before calming them down in a specific nook. My dad had to sign a waiver and there were a lot of rules. Full grown tiger have no fucks about being pet since it was also getting food. When it got up to leave they stood and waited and then they saw if another tiger wanted to get treats. None were interested so my dad's time got cut short. No refunds lol but he loved it."

Thankfully mine tries to understand, he was devastated too. Only difference is he's healing and I'm not. I guess it takes time but it really sucks and I'm so sorry you lost your baby.

Edit: I think it's kind of shit that I'm getting downvoted and berated via comments and my mailbox but I guess that's Reddit for you. I'm literally not hurting anyone at all. I go to work, I'm a good SO. I just cry at night before bed, but yeah. I'm horrible and an alien? For missing my cat?? Sure."

As much as I love my boy, I do not recommend Tamaskans as a whole. There are SO many bad breeders. The ones who are good rarely have puppies and now even the ""good ones"" who health and temperament test have split in half. Half adding wolf blood to the lines and half not. Even the best bred tams have separation anxiety and behavior issues. Overall Owen has been a good dog but he has bitten people and dogs in the past. He's really protective of me, especially on the leash.

He's much better now that he's 10 years old. He was a handful in his younger days, though."
