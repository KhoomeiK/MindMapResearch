Garage passes are about 700 dollars. I’d spend less than 15 dollars on food per week, IF I didn’t bring from home or was extra hungry cause I eat like 5 times a day. Nowadays, you can find textbooks online for free cause college is already too damn expensive.

I would say it’s less than 6k. Also if FAFSA gave you money you would be allowed to pocket it. UTD might give you a full ride though, so you never know."

If you’re a freshman wanting to live on campus, I’d recommend seeing if you’re up to living in an apartment. Maybe double occupancy. It will be so much cheaper for you.

Class tuition per year are around 11k"

He knows I’m going to be busy and I’m going to need time to build my resume. He’s already been through all this and it’s ok. Imo if they couldn’t deal with this fact they wouldn’t be with us.

They know I’m generally lesser than them in terms of grades and would ask me what I’d gotten on tests/quizzes. I just said I did okay...they were obviously disappointed that I didn’t give them the satisfaction they wanted. 

I’ve been wanting to go here since I was in middle school, so I’m kicking myself for not doing better. But, I’m determined to do better this semester. 

Congrats on medical school! :)"

I think I’ve built a sort of apathy towards them, and at this point I don’t care if I get cut off. I’m also pretty stubborn, so that doesn’t really help. 

Are you in college? Try to immerse yourself as much as possible. Lie about where you’re going. Tell them you’ve suddenly joined a mosque. God knows I did an insane amount of lying."

My cousin spent 5 years in undergrad, got into pharmacy school, then had to repeat her freshman year of pharmacy school because she failed. And I admire the fuck out of her."
premed,fel4fn4,t1_fel3yo2,1579213836.0,"Honestly... the way that I *think* is that there will always be a medical school that will accept you. I don’t want to be great, I just want to be good and I want to practice medicine. But I don’t know if this is a healthy mindset to retain the next three years. 

Dude, I’m so scared. Premeds are fucking scary and intimidating, and I am the least competitive person ever. Hopefully someone gives some advice."

I think anyone can define an age gap per their own definitions, but most people here are in relationships 10+ years and that’s how they define an age gap.
