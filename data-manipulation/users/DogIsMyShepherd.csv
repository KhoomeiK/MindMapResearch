WinStupidPrizes,fflazfa,t1_ffiv6ts,1580037334.0,"Absolutely. It's that nugget of stupid that gets drunk people in trouble most of the time. 

The main difference is that everyones little nugget of stupid lies in a different area. Some people do stupid shit like jumping through a god damned window onto a table and then some people do shit like text their exes telling them they miss them..."
EggsInc,fflabpe,t3_eu4ghh,1580037021.0,"Don't be afraid to prestige, ever. If your progress is slow, and you feel like you aren't getting many SE from your prestige, just remember that you are still (and always!) getting *more* than you have now!

If you can't run chickens because your Habs are maxed and you can't afford to expand them in a short and reasonable time frame, prestige and then when you get back to that egg, and near that same level, pop some SE boosts.

If the earning boost you get from this prestige is enough to carry you through to the next egg, then on that egg, when you're close to maxing out your Habs, run 2x SE boosts, 2x boost beacons, and a bird feed, at the highest level of boost you can afford. You don't need to use the unlimited hatchery boost if you run chickens strategically, and to do that (just in case you don't already know) just hold the button until you hit the red amount of chickens left in the hatchery and then release, pressing it again when it's a little bit off from full again. You should be able to keep your chicken running bonus at the highest level you've purchased this way, without having to ""waste"" a beacon spot on the warming bulb boost.

I also just realized that you might not have the upgraded silo thing, and so I unfortunately can't advise you on what the optimal combo of boosts is if you can't run five at a time yet"
musictheory,ffl8988,t1_ffk3o99,1580036152.0,"Definitely keep this in mind for college. A good friend of mine double majored in music and psychology. She happened to just be passionate about both, and couldn't decide which to choose as her one major, and so did both. Incredibly fortunate and lucky for her was that around the time she graduated, music in therapy became much more common and sought out, and she was able to combine her passions.

She's now incredibly successful as a therapist working with a lot of autistic children and adults using music for a wide variety of different therapy treatment plans.

I'm not sure how you could combine electrical engineering and music, but new things are invented all the time!"

It's the only reason I keep my (also patchy) beard most of the time, because I'd rather get mistaken for being a college freshman instead of a high school freshman."

Dorodango,ffhmk18,t1_fbfg8o7,1579942471.0,"When I made my first dorodango (and my only marginally successful one, even though I used the same technique each time) I did this. I put it in a plastic bag and put it in the fridge for about thirty to forty minutes and would be careful with taking it out of the bag to add more super fine dirt to the surface. It worked really well for that one.

My second and third attempts I rushed the process and then gave up out of frustration."

teenagers,ffehl01,t3_et0g04,1579848306.0,"I'm late to the party, but I'm sorry thats how they're acting. It really fucking sucks when you discover that success is punished just as much as failure. A B- that you worked your ass off for is something that you should be proud of, regardless of whether your parents think it is or not.

And there are plenty of people out there in high paying well respected jobs that made only *all* B's or even all C's. Doctors, lawyers, rocket engineers, the probability of every single person in a role like that being people who only ever made As is so laughably miniscule that it doesn't even deserved to be entertained as a thought.

C's still get degrees, every graduation day in almost every graduating class."

nottheonion,ffe5xx9,t1_ffe0szh,1579837565.0,"I dunno, but it'd be a pretty elaborate scam to get documents from a lawyers office documenting the settlement and/or case, presumably with a legit letterhead, from a lawyer whose identity can be verified online, and if they're really wanting to be thorough, calling the lawyer back at a publicly listed number for the law office they're part of, for a start. None of that is really time consuming or difficult."
