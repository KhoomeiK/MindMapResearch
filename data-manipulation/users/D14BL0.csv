And like I said, cross-dressing is *almost exclusively* done by LGBT people. Not always, but almost.

Just because he didn't add ""QIA+"" doesn't mean it was excluded. Lots of people don't add that part because they're used to the traditional term of just ""LGBT"". Most people in the LGBT(QIA+) community understand that when somebody refers to ""LGBT"", they're referring to the whole thing.

>I never said that he couldn't possibly be LGBT so you're arguing against fake points that no one made.

No, but the way you worded it sounded like that was your argument. Perhaps use less emotion when arguing your points, because it makes it difficult for the reader to interpret your intention.

>You're directly saying that crossplay is either non-heterosexual or non-cisgender which is blatantly false.

I'm literally *not* directly saying that at all. I said, multiple times now, that it's very common for cross-dressing to be a part of an LGBT identity. Please don't accuse me of ""arguing against fake points that no one made"", and then immediately in the next sentence do just that. Because it makes you wrong, but twice.

>Don't force your labels on people.

Again, nobody is doing that here. We're *speculating*. I wrote out my other comments carefully and specifically, so that I said *exactly* what I meant. Any ideas you come up with outside of that are your own inference, not mine.

>You're doing harm to the LGBTQIA+ community by supporting ideas like that.

I don't think it's harmful to point out cross-dressing is predominately associated with the LGBT community, because it simply is.

I heavily suggest you read this article. The tl;dr of it is basically that, outside of theatrical situations (like drag shows), most cross-dressing is part of an LGBT identity of some sort: https://lgbt.wikia.org/wiki/Cross-dressing

Specifically this section:

>It can be equally difficult to be certain of the motives of modern day people who cross-dress. The only real proof of motive is that person's own statement. Yet even this is not always certain, as there are examples of people attributing their cross-dressing behaviour to one motive only to later realize that they may have had another reason. The classical example of this would be a transsexual person who initially attributed cross-dressing behaviour to transvestic fetishism (for transwomen) or the utilitarian practicality of male clothing (for transmen)."
NintendoSwitch,ff5a5su,t1_ff44ur1,1579584910.0,"Skyward Sword isn't a *terrible* game, despite a lot of popular opinions that would suggest otherwise. It's visually stunning for its time, the music is fantastic, and the story is really good (it was the game that tried to make sense of the official Zelda timeline Nintendo came up with, and takes place before all of the other games). A lot of people hate the motion controls because they *can* be kind of finicky. For what it's worth, I played with a newer-model Wii controller that had the built-in Wii Motion Plus, so I didn't have to use the add-on attachment. I think that makes a difference.

As a Zelda fan, there are a couple of things I take issue with when it comes to Skyward Sword. The first being that the world just feels empty. There's really only one area in the game that's a sort of social, non-combat area. There's nothing really to do in this area, and there's hardly any NPCs to visit. And of the NPCs that *are* there, most of them are incredibly bland and unremarkable. There's also a flying mechanic where you go to other parts of this open area, but flying is incredibly boring and pretty much nothing ever happens. Think of it like riding the boat in Wind Waker, except instead of random enemy encounters and fun weather events, there's just nothing. A whole lot of nothing. There's pretty much nothing to do while you're traveling or anything worth venturing off into the distance to investigate. It just feels empty and uninspired.

The second problem I have is with the level design. The entire game, from the dungeons to the open-world areas, everything is VERY linearly designed. Pretty much every area is just a simple path from Point A to Point B. There's twists and turns, sure, but pretty much no options to actually *explore*, which I think is one of the biggest things Zelda games are about. Everything is laid out in front of you, and you have very few options to choose your own path. The dungeon puzzles are also super simple and not really engaging at all. Also there's a lot of backtracking through areas you've already visited, but not in the Metroidvania sense where you go back with new items that let you get to areas you couldn't get to before, you just go back through the same paths again because the story says to. For most of these backtracking segments, you're going through the exact same paths you were originally with little to no deviation from what you've already seen before.

If you're a Zelda fan, I definitely suggest giving it a playthrough. If you care about the lore of the series, it's definitely worth it. If you care about fun combat mechanics, Skyward Sword has them. But if you care about an engaging world or hunting for secrets, you'll be disappointed, I think."

> Where did I try to limit who can identify with the group?

The part where you tried to explain all the reasons Samsora can't be LGBT.

>A strawman about the extended grouping (LGBTQIA+) is irrelevant because that's not what was being talked about.

It's not a strawman, and it *is* relevant because we're considering the possibility that Samsora might identify as queer. You know, the Q part of the word. We don't know if Sam does the female cosplays and gets his nails done because it may be part of his sexuality, or his gender identity, or something else entirely. It's entirely within the realm of possibilities that it is, unless he says otherwise. So assuming that he's ""queer"" isn't unreasonable, thus the assumption that he falls under LGBT.

>But even if that were the topic, don't try to force a gender or sexuality on him for it and pretend that you're woke.

I'm literally not. I'm explaining possibilities. If you took any of what I said as ""forcing a gender or sexuality on him"", then you either have reading comprehension issues, or you're just being intentionally obtuse so you can start an argument to flex your opinions. Your entire argument hingest on ""cross-dressing isn't related to sexuality or gender"", which is *technically* true, however an incredibly stark minority of cross-dressers would say that they're not part of LGBT. Which is why, again, it's not unreasonable to make the assumption.

Like I said last time, it's not up to us to decide whether or not he falls under LGBT. We can talk about it though, respectfully. But arbitrarily arguing over your own interpretations of the phrase ""LGBT"" isn't constructive to the conversation. If anything, it's *destructive*, because it makes it that much more difficult for people to have an honest, open conversation about LGBT identities and issues."

While Samsora's said he's not gay, he might have a different gender identity than we may think, and that's why he's comfortable doing female cosplays. And that's fine. Or maybe he's cisgender and just doesn't give a fuck about putting on a dress once in a while. Doesn't matter. It's not up to *us* to decide if he falls under LGBT or not, that's up to him.

On the pro-affinity argument, it makes sense that you want to impose some (somewhat arbitrary) limitations to what mods you can apply, because that means that you'll be picking mods that compliment each other without being very extreme.

On the anti-affinity side, I get that it does kind of make it a bit more of a grind to find gear that actually works for the builds you want. Removing affinity would definitely open the doors for some creative builds. 

In my opinion, I feel like removing affinities would have too much of an influence on the game's meta. The nature of looter-shooters means that you have to keep going until you find just the right gear. The part that makes the game fun *should be* the grind. That's going to be what keeps you coming back as a player. If you remove the grind, you end up with something more akin to what happened with Diablo III, where you may have countless build options, but only a select few of them are worth running, because the lack of limitations means there is always a 100% *most optimal* build.

For instance, say someone is really interested in Cyberpunk 2077. They're not a hardcore gamer by any means, but something about Cyberpunk appeals to them. Maybe they're a fan of the old pen-and-paper Cyberpunk game from back in the day, and they're interested to see the progression of that world and its narrative. They don't own a gaming PC or a console. What option does this person have? Either they spend about $460 just to play one game they're interested in, or they can use a streaming service and just pay the $60 for the one title they want.

Anal tearing during male-on-male sex can cause small amounts of bleeding which more easily allow the virus to transfer from one man to another.

As for artifacting, I rarely ever notice it while playing. I'm getting a super sharp image pretty consistently, even when my roommate is in the other room playing WoW and using Discord VC. 

And Destiny 2's PVP modes can be pretty twitchy and require good reflexes if you're playing with skilled players. The input lag is unnoticeable.

For now. Once the free tier launches, you won't need any additional hardware. If you have a device that can run Chrome, you can play. Or if you already own a Chromecast Ultra, that'll also work.

Only required for now. It's still in a sort of ""early access"" phase.

>doesn't give you any games besides the F2P Destiny

They've given out 2 games a month so far, for three months. And it's not the free version of Destiny 2, it's the full Collection version which includes all the paid DLC campaigns.

>you still need to buy them full-price

The Pro account gives you discounts on some titles, which cycle through from time to time. So you won't always need to pay full retail for some games.

>Who's going to want this? 

People who don't want to buy a new console every 6-7 years and also want the option of being able to play from a multitude of devices. I mostly play on my TV in the living room, but sometimes I like to be able to lay down in bed with my laptop and play the same games.

For me, personally, I bought it because I don't enjoy spending money on upgrading a PC to meet the spec requirements of new games. And I haven't bought a Microsoft/Sony console because there's only a few exclusives that I'm even that interested in, so it's hard for me to justify buying a whole console for just a couple of games that I'd want to play. I've also been spoiled by my Switch, since that made being able to play games without being glued to my couch a possibility, so Stadia also fills in that quality for me. 

Since getting Stadia, I've absolutely fallen in love with Destiny 2, and seeing the low framerate and high load times that other consoles have for D2, I'm glad that I'm playing on Stadia, instead of another platform. I get a consistent 60 FPS, and while the graphic settings are comparable to the PC version's ""medium"" settings, I don't even mind at all because it's still a gorgeous game. And even though Stadia's Destiny 2 population is still pretty low, I usually don't have to wait too long to get into PVP matches or anything. There's plenty of active clans to join, so finding somebody to play with isn't that hard at all."
