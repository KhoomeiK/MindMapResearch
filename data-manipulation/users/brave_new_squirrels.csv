I want to learn how to work sheep. Not only is it something that interests me greatly, but also I would like to have a small farm of my own at some point and having a dog to help out would be important to me. 

In addition, I wanted an agility dog that I could do advanced distance work with. I've worked with dogs who don't naturally have that confidence. They've made decent progress, but I want a dog that's comfortable working up to 100ft away from me. It's difficult to find a dog with both the confidence to send away while still being responsive enough to take direction even at a distance. A well-bred border collie from working lines fits that bill perfectly. Plus, her breeder did genetic testing on  the parents so there are certain diseases that I knew for sure that she wouldn't get even before bringing her home.


It comes down to predictability for me. I was looking for a puppy with a very specific temperament, and I couldn't afford finding anything less than that. Introducing a dog with the wrong temperament or at an older age and it would have caused issues with my older dog. He does best being introduced to puppies and there are many temperaments he won't tolerate. The wrong dog and I'd have dog fights on my hands. Going to a reputable breeder allowed me to find the perfect pup though, and she fits into our life very well and gets along with my temperamental dog perfectly."
