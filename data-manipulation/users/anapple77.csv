singapore,ffhktr3,t1_ffh9gi0,1579939946.0,True but this is the way how job search works. Details of individual have to be revealed when applying for jobs. I find it inappropriate as well

Commodities,fesi79j,t1_ferpe5t,1579365397.0,"Tried to search for OECD inventories but it is not free for public. Requires subscription fees, sadly. When u mentioned ‘connect’, how do u connect? I assume u r using some statistical methods like MA etc?

One more qns, inventory data are weekly so we can only estimates weekly as well but WTI prices are daily. How do we reconcile the time difference? I am guessing we average up WTI prices for weekly too or we can just assume inventory figures are only correlated to WTI on the day of the inventory data released?"
Commodities,fesdcgm,t1_ferp70s,1579364080.0,"Nice to know there is an analyst over here contributing to this thread ! 
I took a look at the EIA website. I couldn’t find DOE (I assume they are the same). They provide weekly crude oil production, import and export in kbpd and inventory in k bbls. I can’t find the data on consumption but I can derive all it from the data mentioned above (I assume). 

I can use excel to do a simple forecast for the next few weeks (haven’t tried that yet). Then when eia publish the weekly data I can compare my estimates of inventory with their actual inventory. 

Am I doing all these right? But it still doesn’t show the link to the prices. Yes supply and demand affect prices. But doing a simple forecast of inventories levels based on past actual data will only allows me to spot seasonal pattern perhaps? (I am guessing along the line of smth like summer gasoline demand is more etc) 

I can’t have a better grasp of how inventories will affect the prices and a proxy to allow me to anticipate the change in inventory because my forecasts are based on past data and are not dynamic. For example, I know flows (imports and exports) can be estimated by tracking the vessels. That is dynamic and based on actual happenings. Am I right on this based on my very limited knowledge ? Hope to hear your thoughts on this !"
Commodities,ferhtfp,t1_ferhkkm,1579354062.0,That will be a good data source but how do we proceed with it? We have data showing the import and export but how do we interpret whether there is a shortage of supply or increase in demand?
