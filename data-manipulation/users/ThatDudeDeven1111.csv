insaneparents,fe4v6pw,t3_eb30xy,1578863108.0,"Wow, this is heartbreaking. It's bad even without reading the terrible words: the little boy is sitting way off to the side of her, barely on the blanket, clearly uncomfortable and in the smaller ""group"" photo you can tell they asked him to slide closer, but now her bigger child's legs are in the way? She doesn't even want him touching her. What a bitch!

What kind of asshole dad even let's this happen? He isn't even pictured in the photo with his dad. I'm a single dad myself and I'd never let that fly. I couldn't tell me son to stay out of the picture and have him watch me holding someone else's kid without him in the picture. It's not ""yours"" and ""mine"", it's ours or leave/I'm leaving."
