Anyway, I went to college done computer programming (dropped out in 2nd year due to class politics killing the subject for me) went back the following year completed my HNC & HND in IT for business. Got a job with IBM doing tech support worked my way up to Team leader, I am now an IT support Analyst for NHS.

By the time I had my break the canteen had tv with people huddled around. Nobody was talking. Even those not watching the TV. Next day and with wall to wall coverage went to pull bae and news channel was on the big screen normally reserved for sports. I remember again nobody was really speaking and it was like watching something from a Hollywood blockbuster movie. Didn't feel real.
