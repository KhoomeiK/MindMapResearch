AdviceForTeens,fd3qb4b,t1_fd3p5cm,1578160771.0,"thatâ€™s what you think now.  a friendship or friend group defined by its bad mental health does not leave room for growth. when our conversations constantly revolves around staying home and watching anime and shit for hours on end and our terrible lives, it made it so we were all dedicated to non-recovery. we all based our friendship on our depression, and thatâ€™s what sent my friend group crumbling. a lot of them are still together, but me and my best friend dipped and started talking to new people, which worked out really well. I got my first real romantic relationships and actual fun friend activities with the new people, who were basically just my acquaintances before then. these next couple years can be really awesome if you surround yourself with people who actually care about you and donâ€™t just brush you off, and when youâ€™re actually able to recover. it doesnâ€™t happen immediately, but itâ€™s super satisfying. 

do what you think is right. I hope things work out for you <3"
