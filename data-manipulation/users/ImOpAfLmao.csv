SandersForPresident,fem2grh,t1_fem147e,1579237569.0,"Whenever Ipsos partners with 538, it's always skewed and their results are never truly reflected in the national polls. They basically poll some people and then after the debate poll the exact same people (most don't respond), so of those who respond, there is an obvious response bias. Take it with a grain of salt tbh."

SandersForPresident,felg2jl,t1_felfyh2,1579221338.0,"I'm comparing registered voters, not the poll with all adults. On 538 look at the past two Ipsos polls, both of them are with registered voters, so it's a more accurate comparison. Sanders did get 2 points from the one with adults, but he had 20 with the registered voters poll."
SandersForPresident,felfae3,t3_epsc14,1579220807.0,"Sanders leads. 

If compared to the last poll with just democrats, the numbers are Sanders 20 (-) Biden 19 (-4) Warren 12 (-3) Bloomberg 9 (+1) Buttigieg 6 (-1).

If compared to the last poll with democrats and independents, the numbers are Sanders 20 (+3) Biden 19 (+4) Warren 12 (+2) Bloomberg 9 (+3) Buttigieg 6 (+1).

We need to wait until the full poll is released to be sure, since 538 is calling this poll 552 RV instead of 681 A as they usually do with ipsos. Also note that this poll didn't seem to poll preferences of candidates other than the top 5, so the number changes could be off by a bit. 

This is the first poll after the January Democratic debate, conducted January 15 - 16."

Biotechplays,fekdi7z,t1_fekd99m,1579197769.0,Yeah I personally think I'll just take profits when it goes to 40 with my feb 35$ calls: there's still a chance (albeit very small) that Palforzia isn't approved though right?
Biotechplays,fekd4vm,t1_fekcpt3,1579197550.0,"Yeah that's fair - though after approval people could just assume that since the drug is so important and could affect a good chunk of the market, they might keep buying in. But I see your point with AMRN."

How big is your position rn?"
personalfinance,fdxwyd9,t3_en8ykw,1578773790.0,"Don't take the advice of financial advisors that work at brokerages that aren't independent - more often than not they'll probably just be looking out for their own interests (if they get more sales of stuff their brokerage approves, then they get more commissions). Even if they are a fiduciary, you're still limited since they can only offer stuff their brokerage approves. The only financial advisors you should consider are independent fee-only ones, since they're looking out for your interests (the fee is usually a percentage of the money they manage), and can tell you about literally any stock/bond/mutual fund, etc."

smallstreetbets,fcqnb6r,t3_eidv2b,1577889006.0,"Because you don’t actually “want” to get assigned, you want to keep collecting premium for as long as possible on trades. Also, if it hardly costs anything to close out the position, it’s better to do so than getting assigned, since stock fluctuations after you get assigned are magnifying your potential losses (you now own 100 shares per contract). Same goes with selling calls, you don’t want to give up your shares for the strike price, because you have the potential to lose out on a ton of potential gains (same reason as above, you already have 100 shares per contract, so any fluctuation in the negative direction could magnify your losses/curb your potential gains after you give back your shares for the predetermined strike price). Your goal isn’t to hold stocks for a long time - it’s to collect premium. That being said, you have to calculate whether you want to close out your position based on the price of doing so - if it’s too expensive for you to close it out, then you may choose to run the risk of getting assigned."
