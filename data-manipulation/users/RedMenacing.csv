butterface,ffqtks2,t1_ffqpr8t,1580143332.0,Have to start a new sub I guess
butterface,ffqtglo,t1_ffqlpjy,1580143257.0,Faceshaming?  In butterface?  What are we here for?  Honest question unless I'm missing something.
Art,ff8lja5,t1_ff84q64,1579684398.0,Came here to say this.  Too bad it's the best damn song of the genre.  Amazing music video as well.
movies,ff2e8kk,t1_ff2aorm,1579502522.0,Never heard of it and just watched the trailer.  That O.G. trailer voice.
GamersBeingBros,ff28bmb,t1_ff1lcvn,1579496739.0,How did yall become friends online?  What was the beginning?
alitabattleangel,feos9vf,t1_femq6xq,1579304725.0,"Planning on asking them directly.  I also saw that they said 30 years in response to a YouTube video.  I don't know if it should be dry, humid, a proper relative humidity or what.  I will have it under glass or acrylic to keep dust off of it and have UV protective clear film on that.  Also a silicon gasket on the bottom to create a airtight seal if that's suggested by the manufacturer.  Hell, I'll build a vacuum chamber if that helps.  Lol would be pretty cool idea to have a one way mirror so you can't see it until lights inside turn on."

alitabattleangel,fem2o9z,t1_fejtxke,1579237762.0,That's what did it for me.  It looks amazing.  I'd assume it's easier to get it to look right on a larger scale than a 1/6 or 1/4 figure.   Yeah the extra arm would have been nice.
alitabattleangel,fejczzw,t1_feiczci,1579167912.0,Will do.  I plan on building a display case for it as well.  This will be epic to have.
unstirredpaint,feheliq,t1_fefsyxx,1579114942.0,When the open-eye hallucinations look like that.. I'm too far gone to be amazed.  By then the auditory hallucinations are more interesting.
alitabattleangel,fehdl7f,t1_feguqpb,1579114359.0,I have seen any of the Weta ones.  Have they shipped yet?
alitabattleangel,feh6hvu,t1_feggxoq,1579110160.0,I know they say there will be other busts or figures/statues but who knows when that will be or how much.  This is ridiculous that a movie I went to see on a whim has caused so much obsession.
alitabattleangel,feh67i8,t1_feggxoq,1579109986.0,"I'm cutting out my weekly beer, no compulsive fast food stops, no solo trips to the bar and some other things I'll find along the way.  Also I'm going to make some extra cash on the side.  That's the only way I justified buying it.  I thought it would sell out within seconds so I was hitting the refresh button rapidly.  It actually went live at 8:01pm Beijing time."
alitabattleangel,fegerc9,t3_ep057e,1579090245.0,"There's definitely something magical about this movie.  The first 3 weeks after I watched it, I couldn't stop talking about it.  And now.. just now.. it has cost me a lot of money lol."
alitabattleangel,fegegzk,t3_eouyme,1579089930.0,It's done.  Special edition deposit paid.  Time to grind for that extra money.  Mixed feelings but I'm sure they'll be positive once it shows up.
alitabattleangel,fefy4xb,t1_fefes83,1579069136.0,Thinking I'm going to go for the trimming and earning route.  Who knows.  Maybe they'll be sold out seconds after going up for sale.
alitabattleangel,fefrgjp,t1_fefjzpj,1579063047.0,They even mentioned in a comment section of a YouTube review of the terminator bust that the silicon skin should last 30 years.  What happens after that lol?  I hope I'm still around.  Should collectors have it inside a case with inert gas and UV blocking glass?
alitabattleangel,fefc9zm,t1_fefb8ur,1579053188.0,"There's a list longer than I would like of things I need/want to spend the money on.  This seems like a one time opportunity though.  I can still get done the things that need to be taken care of.  I really wish I knew what else they're coming out with in the future.  The doll body is my favorite out from the movie.  I'm going to refrain from guessing how much that will be.  If I'm able to buy one before they sell out, I'm going to start cranking out some things that I make to earn the extra money before it ships.  I was emotionally drained and kinda sick just thinking about this decision today.  I'm known to be very tight with my money except when I decide to spend it if that makes any sense... I think it's go time lol."
AskReddit,fe0aono,t1_fdyovie,1578807947.0,Sleepy boners are also a thing.  I'm tired and off it goes.  Just woke up. Boom.  After dinner and I'm starting to dose off.. boom.

aww,fcpeyo6,t3_ei5b6c,1577861064.0,I'm for this video to be clear.  Why is this video and others praised but the picture of two daughters deciphering xmas gift clues bashed by so many?

shrooms,fco6buo,t1_fcmi3oj,1577824913.0,I see an animal of a man.  A wolf in sheep's clothing.  Very scary.  Not a good soul.  But I'm a picture perfect husband and father on the outside.  That's why I stay away from the mirror.  I've had a conversation with that reflection about things not worth sharing if I value my freedom lol.
shrooms,fcmfw5e,t3_ehurgb,1577773741.0,"Looking in the mirror is 20 minutes of my trip I never get back lol.  I warn everyone not to look in the mirror.  I even talk to it when I pass by ""NO, we are NOT doing that this time."""
WatchItForThePlot,fc44n0i,t3_efruto,1577406519.0,No one mentioned that Mercy video eh?
