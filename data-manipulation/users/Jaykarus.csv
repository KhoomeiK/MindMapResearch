wholesomememes,fconc5t,t1_fco7jl4,1577836548.0,oof thank you so much for the heads up
wholesomememes,fco27kq,t1_fco1qvr,1577822719.0,Absolutely. He got skinnier too. He’s eating like crazy now. I fed him some fresh fish and some dry cat food and he’s still hungry. Now I’m trying to just pet him and hug him to sleep because I’m sure if he eats so much all at once he’ll throw up.
wholesomememes,fco0k8a,t1_fco096y,1577821913.0,Oh lol. Yeah I linked his images because after I finished writing it I realised anyone could’ve written that comment for farming Karma. So here’s proof hehe

I gotta hug him tightly now tho. The fireworks are spooking him"
wholesomememes,fcnpxy8,t3_ei4o4m,1577816227.0,My [kitten](https://imgur.com/a/l3OtC8I) went missing a week ago and I found him just a few hours ago. He’s [chilling](https://imgur.com/a/iElQvY2) with me on my bed as I write this and I honestly can’t be happier to spend the new year with my little buddy after I thought I lost him forever.
