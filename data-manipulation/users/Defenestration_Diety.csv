I know Odyssey runs their own factories in the US and UK, and France - so I kind of doubt OP is working for a place selling rebranded stuff under that name.  

You can also get high performance lightweight lithium starter batteries now that are maybe 20% of the weight of traditional lead-acid batteries.  Then there is lead-crystal technology that is better for taking a charge than lead acid and isn't damaged by deep cycles.
