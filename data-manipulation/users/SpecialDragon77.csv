AskReddit,ffpwdrr,t1_ffplvvn,1580108324.0,"I'll add something else: When you're speaking with a group of people, make eye contact with everyone. I was at an event on the weekend where an individual who was talking would look at everyone in the group except two people, neither of whom she had met before. The ones she was making eye contact with are influential people so it appeared that she was ignoring the others because she didn't think they are ""important enough"" (which is possible, she's an entertainment lawyer who is quite successful)."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ff4p6eo,t1_ff3yrk4,1579569092.0,"Or at least some of the Mandela Effect is a perfect example of people's memories being faulty. Isn't it possible that people remember the Monopoly Man as having a monocle because another popular character of the time who also has a top hat and cane -- Mr. Peanut -- has a monocle. Because memories are sometimes filed with things that are similar, and ""Monopoly"" and ""monocle"" are similar words, it's not surprising that many people would ""remember"" the Monopoly Man having a monocle."

Mouse knocks on the door to where the mice live. 

Mice in squeaky voice: ""Who is it?""

Your cat Mouse: ""It's Mouse"".

Mice: ""Okay, you can come i...... aaaaaah!"""
