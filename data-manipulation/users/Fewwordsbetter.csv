President Trump has repeatedly promised to end what he calls America’s “endless wars,” fulfilling a promise he made during the campaign.

No wars have ended, though, and more troops have deployed to the Middle East in recent months than have come home. Mr. Trump is not so much ending wars, as he is moving troops from one conflict to another.

There is nothing wrong with seeing options.  She would make an amazing VP, if Bernie wins the primaries, and Tulsi is VP, we could see 4 or 8 years of Bernie, and 8 years of Tulsi.... not a bad thing!
