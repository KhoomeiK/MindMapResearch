Always tell them I'm fucking with them so I dont create an flat earthers or something though)

Speaking of flat earthers, did you know that even though the earth isn't flat, the carbon density in the air at the current moment is actually making the earth deflate? By 2047 the earth will be completely deflated and actually flat. Which in turn sends earth out of orbit and flyinng towards the sun slowly, but surely.

Me and a buddy had just been going to play some other text based online game and saw him. Ended up being good friends, hanging at the library computer room playing rs, despite a 20 year age difference. He and his mom hooked us up fat when we first started. Sad I can't remember either username.. although I do remember they made a 25 minute drive to the library almost every day to play rs. About 17 or so years ago btw. Maybe more. It was about a year before rs2 as I remember the beta for classic members. So whenever that was"
