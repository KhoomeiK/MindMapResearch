PetiteGoneWild,ff2kkk8,t3_eqyntd,1579510424.0,Bet your thighs would feel great around my waist while your tight pussy grabs my cock
cats,ff2kbxs,t3_er7fi9,1579510088.0,So sorry for your loss. Your kitty looked so happy and content and talented.
cats,fek2urm,t3_epi5jh,1579191433.0,Shes a cute fuzz ball. Good to snuggle up with on a cool day.
cats,fe6klcn,t3_enw4hp,1578893987.0,Now that's customer service!
Catswithjobs,fdtsdm8,t3_emvr2t,1578721455.0,Your cat scan will prove I'm over 21.

cats,fdr85mc,t3_emplz5,1578680784.0,What a smart kitty!
cats,fdpn8jc,t3_em9s6d,1578633499.0,My cat was listening to this and was really fixated.  He meows the same way when going to the vet.
cats,fdmmkrh,t3_elzngb,1578555704.0,"Yeah, take him to the vet. He's still hot life in him at 17.  Don't just assume he's checking out"

cats,fdjngsf,t3_elgfz9,1578479448.0,That's a cute fluff ball
secretsanta,fdjk3a2,t1_fdjjz3l,1578474550.0,I already did. I'm just posting that I had shipped my rematch gifts since I shipped direct from Amazon and didn't want to give away what I got them
cats,fdgr3ww,t3_el9s7k,1578406142.0,Hey there cutie! Who's a good kitty??
cats,fdfv3jh,t3_ekym3c,1578371004.0,"A cute, fluffy bookmark you can cuddle! S/he just wants your love and attention."
secretsanta,fdfuz15,t1_fddthao,1578370909.0,"Don't thank your santa. Reach out to moderators and they may reach out to your original SS and ask for proof he/she actually shipped the package if proof hasn't already been provided.  If the package was lost, then there's shipping insurance that most carriers provide to cover this, your SS should be compensated and resend your gift(s). Unless they didn't buy insurance or the carriers insurance doesn't cover the claim.  Your ss should've given you tracking information. If not, then you should ask for it through the moderators if not posted.  If stolen, you may be sol if proof shows the package was properly delivered to the correct address."
secretsanta,fddbw4l,t1_fdd5770,1578304691.0,"You would report no gift then, and get rematched. I think it may be too late for a rematch now though"
secretsanta,fddbq6r,t1_fdczb0e,1578304442.0,"I don't think so unless your rematch santa reaches out to you first. I couldn't see who my SS was, only my giftees info showed up.  So unless they contact you, there's no way to contact them yourself.  You CAN update your profile and say you're away from home and hope your rematch sees it."
christmas,fd812ln,t3_ek2mr1,1578212719.0,This is my cat tree hooman! Put it back up!
cats,fd1l49a,t3_ejse04,1578132771.0,So cute! Love his little bowtie!
Onlythecutestsellers,fd1kxuj,t3_ejmv8u,1578132696.0,Scammer! She takes your money and runs!
secretsanta,fd17hg8,t1_fd11n41,1578128327.0,It would be nice if they were more active on reddit. They don't follow any subreddits and have no posts.  These newbies are hard to shop for especially when you're on a fixed income and time is not on your side so you have to take a gamble based on their vague redditgifts profile.
secretsanta,fd11n41,t1_fd106u5,1578126570.0,I never said they didn't deserve a rematch.
secretsanta,fd0vxdt,t1_fd0vf5i,1578124481.0,They're new to reddit so their profile was very vague.  They did say they like Harry Potter.
secretsanta,fd0timd,t1_fd0rg0n,1578123550.0,Unfortunately I'm not a homemade crafts type of guy. I'm anything but crafty so I wouldn't know where to start to create something nice for them.  Same thing with sports. I wouldn't know where to begin plus my giftee doesn't seem to be into sports.
secretsanta,fd0mipp,t1_fd0ig1a,1578120896.0,"I wasn't laid off, I work in healthcare and they reworked everyone's master schedule. I'm not the only person who is upset over the new schedule they posted.  I'll reach out to my rematch but my rematch looks to be inactive and a newbie like he/she signed up to reddit just to get a gift.  The same with my original giftee."
cats,fd070uw,t3_ejlz4x,1578114589.0,What a cute baby. Momma loves her kitty.
secretsanta,fcww04m,t3_ejbahc,1578039959.0,That's an amazing book from my childhood. Loved having it read to me before bedtime.
Catswithjobs,fcwijcq,t3_ej1uh1,1578026552.0,Kitty needs his cut!
cats,fcwih0x,t3_ej7dnb,1578026500.0,He's judging you from his high vantage point. Master judge at work!
cats,fcvr35m,t3_ej3o4g,1578008190.0,I cant say no to that cute face!
cats,fcu753v,t3_eixnsl,1577974161.0,He's so cute. What's he looking at?
cats,fcr5tqv,t3_eidx89,1577897208.0,Looks like hes still figuring out his judgement.
PetiteGoneWild,fcr3w0l,t3_eiikt0,1577896403.0,You forgot to remove your panties
AskReddit,fcjakpa,t3_ehay2h,1577681429.0,Sure thing. Women aren't interested in me. Been trying forever and not a single woman even wanted to date me.
secretsanta,fcfvm34,t1_fcfv5jj,1577634167.0,I am a rematch santa too.  Just haven't been rematched. There's a chance I may not be rematched if they don't have many who didn't get a gift
secretsanta,fcfuthu,t1_fcftxwx,1577633939.0,"If they rematch you, its unlikely you'll get matched with another giftee to send to unless you signed up to be a rematch santa.  A rematch is just to get you a gift."
secretsanta,fcft9yc,t1_fcfsr1j,1577633511.0,My understanding is that a low rating may bar the person who sent the gift from future exchanges or it could backfire and get you barred if they deem that you just didn't like your gift.
secretsanta,fcfs5ri,t3_eh5zf8,1577633257.0,"Report no gift received.  If you put in a rating for the gift, it doesn't matter. Its posted everywhere: don't review a gift if you did not receive your proper gift.  Once you rate a gift, you cannot be rematched."
cats,fcfrk15,t3_eh5bim,1577633062.0,The most innocent looking are the ones that create the most trouble
PetiteGoneWild,fcfra57,t3_eh5pr7,1577632970.0,Grab that ass while fucking your tight pussy
secretsanta,fcfek8a,t3_eh1ik8,1577629169.0,I heard from my giftee that he received it however not since so not sure if he enjoyed what I bought him.
fitbit,fcfe44a,t3_eh5v65,1577629015.0,I'm jealous.  I barely get over a score of 72 much less get so much deep and rem sleep.
Onlythecutestsellers,fcev6sx,t1_fceqnwi,1577624043.0,Thanks for the heads up!  Not that I would buy from someone who flips us the bird in the sale photo
Onlythecutestsellers,fceu9h5,t3_eh5eo4,1577623845.0,"Flipping off potential buyers is a huge giveaway this person is a scammer. She just wants your money!!  No, I will not be buying from you today or ever!"
r4r,fcetub1,t3_eh30r0,1577623724.0,"Nice looking computer. Sorry,I'm not a gamer myself but I can relate to almost everything else except I've never had a relationship. Just a few dates that ended in the usual ""not you, its me"" statement."
cats,fc6aehf,t3_egccw7,1577475970.0,What an adorable family you have! How'd you get them all to group together and stay?
PetiteGoneWild,fc6a6y1,t3_egdhch,1577475829.0,Gotta show face though
LabiaGW,fc29px3,t3_efsjm5,1577347379.0,I wanna fill your pussy with my cock
