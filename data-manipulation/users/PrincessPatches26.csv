AskReddit,ffcfpuu,t3_esr647,1579798478.0,That's a hard one. For m I think its fixing things. I like to help and I like to fix things when things are broken and it is hard for me bot to stand up to just go help..... I hate myself for it because now i am known by my boss as Rambo because i can fix anything or at least almost anything with little tools. But then there are days i dont want to help and fix and show people how to do something.... but I also feel bad I'm not helping.

dogs,ffbayz4,t3_esje72,1579757990.0,Yes I have had that happen before I didnt get bit though. The dog was a airdale terrier and I lifted that dog and he was still holding on to our old mutt dog. Thank goodness he did let go after I grabbed his hair under his chin and pulled but it took a bit. I do hope your dog will be ok. AND THE TETNIS shot I should suggest and check to see if the dog was vaccines to see if you need to rabies shot.

dogs,fd5tcp9,t3_ejyiyu,1578181282.0,"Mine is a 54 pound pit/collie and she will sleep most of the time between my husband and I. Around 7am my alarm goes off, you hear my husband wake up a bit sigh and turn over, then you hear my dog Luna stretch, yawn, moan, and probably moo as she turns over also. I turn off my alarm and ly there a bit waking up. She will start scooting closer to the tip of the bed waiting to see am i awake? If by any chance i unplug my cellphone she will pounce on my and start licking my face and rubbing me with her nose and then huffs. Then i say you want to get up? She will push off of me and jump down and sit at the door for me to click her leash on."

dogs,fct8qhr,t3_eipe5j,1577935879.0,If there was a way to put a pic I would... but I dont know how to. But yes she out her tennis balls into her food dish and then eats her food around them.
dogs,fcsyo5a,t3_eipe5j,1577928419.0,It is his way of having fun. Mine has fun putting her balls in her food bowl then dig at her bowl. And sometimes makes a mess she cleans up. Every dog had there own thing that they so to have fun. Another thing mine likes to do is set her ball on the couch or something at an angle and let's it roll away so she can play catch with herself.
AskReddit,fc4jai2,t3_efvlbd,1577418296.0,So I do that about half the time through tax season. The biggest thing I hate is I cant bring my dog and I miss home cooking. The company pays for the room so I get a normal room nothing but a microwave and sometimes a good fridge and freezer. I do like fresh sheets and towels no need to do that laundry.
