I would guess that most programs you apply to aren't going to weigh your scores too heavily, so don't beat yourself up too much about it. Remember that there are a lot of components to a strong application and it's easy to get down on yourself when you hang around this sub and see people talking about scoring 165+ in the quant section."

Showerthoughts,ffccda3,t1_ffca5a2,1579796403.0,"In my experience it was because exams were the only way to actually test whether or not students knew the concepts that they had learned and could apply their knowledge to other things. You can ask tough questions on homework assignments, but then you haven't really assessed how much math skill a student had because you don't know what outside help they may have used. Higher level math at the end of the day is not so much about learning how to solve a specific kind of problem as it is learning a concept and intuition to apply to something you haven't seen before.

Teachers do it in a lot of subjects because it's a better way to assess the knowledge of a whole class than a simple test where you're average is like an 80. Usually those tests with averages in the 40s will have some people in the 80s or 90s and some in the teens. That makes it very easy to assign grades at the end of the semester because there is a clear line between who deserves an A and a B and so forth rather than a half of a point being the difference between each letter grade."

If you're thinking of electrons orbiting a nucleus like the bohr model, that's not a representation of their actual movement. As others have said, we can't actually measure the momentum and location of an electron without some degree of uncertainty. The best way to visualize where an electron is is by looking at a probability density of an electron, which is basically a heat map of where we think the electron could be at any time (we figure these out by solving the Schrodinger equation).

The interactions between the electron and the nucleus become less and less obvious when atoms get larger. For a Hydrogen atom, there is one proton and one electron, so explaing how they interact is fairly simple. When you start adding more electrons, however, now they start to interact with each other which makes things very complex. The way they interact with one another becomes more important than they way they interact with the nucleus. It's a complex topic and takes a lot of work for chemists and physicists to get a full understanding of it."

chemistry,ff5g1nr,t1_ff379te,1579591280.0,"I currently work in the QC lab for a major pharmacuetical manufacturer, and I'm sure that my experience differs from others but I would expect some parallels. Nobody gets into our R&D lab without a PhD or really compelling masters research. I work with people daily with pharmaceutical chemistry degrees, masters in chemistry, one with a PhD in biopharm, and a variety of other degrees as well. A lot of folks expect that putting in some time in the QC lab would translate to being able to move into the R&D lab, but it just doesn't work like that at this company. No amount of QC experience will earn someone a place in R&D.

That being said, there are a ton of jobs and different places to move within our company, and a lot of places to make a ton of cash, just not research positions.

TLDR: In my experience, research positions are difficult to land without at least some advanced degree. There are a lot of well-paying jobs for someone with a B.S. in pharmaceutical chemistry in a variety of roles. Pharmacists make more but can get kind of pigeonholed in their work."

Because of the size of our lab, things can tend to be micromanged and we do a lot of things differently than other labs to try and ensure consistency throughout.

Day to day, I run finished product and intermediate testing via HPLC and UPLC. It's pretty repetitive every day, and most of my time is spent preparing samples and solutions, the rest is making sure all the i's are dotted and t's crossed.

The overall experience has been soul-crushing to say the least. It's definitely not a job I could do for a long time. There is very little science that goes into my work and we often say ""compliance over science"" is how our lab operates. Thats not to say it isnt for everyone, because some people really like this style of work, its just not for me. On top of all that, I'm still on a contract position (We were originally told that we would be hired in 12-18 months) making way less than I could elsewhere.

I've seen so many listings and spoke to so many employers over the past year and a half that I can honestly say it's sometimes very difficult to get a feel for what a job will be from a listing. Make sure you ask employers about what the day to day roles of a job are during the interview process. I've spoken to employers looking for chemists with 5 years of experience to be SOP monkey's for 15 bucks an hour, and I've seen employers looking for chemists with little to no experience doing really cool high level work. I also think that the pay an employer is offering is usually indicative of what the role requires (i.e. a job paying minimum wage may just be barcode scanning, while one paying more probably has more daily chemistry work.)

Tomlin and the current coaching staff will give them the best chance to win games and maybe make a championship run in the twilight of Ben's career. After he retires, it may be worthwhile to consider if ownership feels like Tomlin is the right coach to work with and develop a new QB. I don't really know what the answer to that question is, but I do think that Tomlin has proven himself capable of working with new talent at the position, and I would think that Fichner would likely be shown the door after Ben retires."
