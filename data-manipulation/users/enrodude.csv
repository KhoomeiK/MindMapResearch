He would even go to the cigarette\lottery cash and swipe cartons of cigarettes to resell at school. It went as far as him going into the back of the store, taking those empty 20L (5 gallon) water jugs from the back of the store since the store didn't inventory them, fill up his car (They were $10 each) and return them at other stores.

File a complaint with CCTS and make a withhold payment with your credit card. I used previous invoices as proof.

For shits and giggles; contact them and see how long it takes to fix the issue. Please PM me."

Only problem I encountered at that border crossing into the US was when they did an X-Ray sweep for random cars. I was insulted at first but noticed they called a bunch of cars in a row to sweep as well so it was understandable. I was just the first in the line."
