Also, I don’t want this to shock you, but most people of any age are not sitting around thinking about what other people eat. If you read everything in sound bites, you will not have an accurate understanding of what people think. 
Perhaps read an online newspaper, a magazine, or a book."

AmItheAsshole,ffgecyc,t3_et8zc8,1579904352.0,"Hi kiddo! I don’t know if you’ll ever read this, as there are so many posts! First, I’m very sorry for your loss. Second, you are right to speak up and ask for what you need. While you’re in high school, use schoolwork to distract you from your troubles, as it will take a while for things to shake out with your Mom. Help your sister and your brother, too. If your mom has siblings or a mom/dad (your grandparents), see what they say. 
 
Everyone has been through a loss in your family. As you move through this time, maybe write down your feelings. Say less than you think - words are tricky, they cannot be taken back. (Though they can be forgive people ). Use your writing to gather your thoughts and to express them carefully when appropriate."
