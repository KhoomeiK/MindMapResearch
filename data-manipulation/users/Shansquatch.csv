Good luck and know that whatever choice you make with your dog's best interest in mind, that's the right choice. Sending you and your pup lots and lots of love!"
dogs,fcyk6d6,t3_ejiwuy,1578081479.0,"I had a chocolate lab that had cushing's disease and diabetes. Our vet said we should give it a shot to treat it. We did blood tests twice a day and insulin shots if needed. She lived another 3 years with that schedule. But, we were very aware of how she was doing all the time. When she had a couple days in a row of suffering and those same days we couldn't control her blood sugar, we took her in right away to sleep. Our vet was hopeful from the beginning and really guided us, but it's not for everyone. I will say, if you are worried about how your dog would do with the treatment, our dog wasn't phased in the slightest by the pricking for blood tests and the insulin shots. She stayed very calm. She definitely knew it was her medicine and she would feel better after. But, it's not for everyone and I know that for sure. Just thought I would give some perspective as someone who did have experience with the treatments."
