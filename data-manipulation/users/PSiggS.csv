UFOdiscussions,fehafif,t3_ep091t,1579112504.0,"I think for the most part it would depend on HOW we find them, and what we observe when we get there. If we for instance, pick up the radio waves or photons from nuclear testing, and we find the species in a state of conflict with itself, it’s probably not the best thing to “kick the beehive” without knowing enough about the social structures and profound inter-species concepts, to determine the effect. It would make sense to assume that a civilization at this point is either going to collapse by it’s own means, or overcome through planetary unification and expand into space (fantastic research opportunity for any other civilization, so far advanced, that we seem ancient). We would want to avoid tipping the scales, if at all, until learning more, we would need to case out their capabilities and the types of weaponry they have, if they are a confrontational species, we don’t want to send our “first contacts” into an unknown situation, it would be risky to leave ourselves vulnerable like that, especially as an envoy who may not have the immediate rescue capabilities of backup. 

We would need to know the chemical composition of the organisms to avoid detrimental contamination, or introduction of caustic materials. We would need to know this about pretty much, EVERY organism and their interdependencies on environment, to avoid disrupting a food chain, symbiotic relationship, or environment, any of which could collapse an entire ecological system. So we might need some samples to compare biodiversity and compatibility.
It is important to remember that the focus may not be solely on the dominant civilization, but in a circumstance like Earth, there is a LOT of other data to collect about the planet. If the dominant civilization doesn’t have the technology to follow, or intercept us, we can just disappear for a bit after doing research then come back later if need be.

If we are to assume that we are space-faring we would probably be developed enough, to the point that pretty much all research could be done with non-invasive drones, doing detailed scanning passes, which could track organisms and use AI to find patterns in MetaData, determine surface and subterranean compositions, while occasionally collecting samples for analyzation, if need be. We would need to be cautious. There would be no need to jump straight into things, unless it is determined that, in an urgent circumstance, we need to step in and interact with a civilization for x number of reasons."
