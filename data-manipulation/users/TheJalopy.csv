nba,ffxj6iv,t3_evnxi9,1580326209.0,Dude there is nothing Kobe would have hated more than for everyone to spend days crying and not playing. He loved this game and those who played it even if he talked a lot of shit lol.

If that's the case...I'm about to have a rough two years..."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fd9k6ye,t3_ek8drf,1578234549.0,When I was in we did this shit like once a year. Most of the time it was just signing some shit from DEERS and giving it to admin.
DestinyTheGame,fd2uxi1,t3_ejo4i3,1578151827.0,"100% agree. I play games like this because I enjoy running the same shit over and over, collecting things that make me look cool, and reading lore. I spend most of my time on YT with lore daddy Byf and other. I WANT to spend hundreds of hours doing the same shit for digital shiney stuff. 

What I don't want is to spend most of my time juggling bounties, inventory, and generally playing the in a way I don't enjoy. If I do play it how o want, I feel like it's wasting my time and that I could be getting more."
pcmasterrace,fcuqb2v,t1_fcujmh6,1577986343.0,"This has been every experience I've had trying to play League and DOTA. I play a lot of online games (mostly fighting games) but MOBAs are a mystery.   Finally got my girlfriend to teach me League, but I still only play with her."

HumansBeingBros,fcp843e,t3_eiavlp,1577853650.0,"This is really cute and heartwarming but I don't understand why she was asking questions? If she was taking the same class as the girl and doing well, then why didn't she just tutor the friend? Why was she asking questions about things that she apparently already knew as she aced the tests? If not, why is she bothering another teacher about a subject that they don't teach?"
modernwarfare,fcp7llc,t3_ei8pfl,1577853142.0,"This is me, but every time it comes up in quick play now. I know I'm part of the minority in the sub but that map is trash and putting it in quick play is infuriating. 

Please give me a way of disabling this map.

Tekken,fcleljh,t1_fckqu34,1577746002.0,Check out Battle Beaver. They make a replacement D-pad that's pretty neat. Changes the inputs to individual presses instead of the one piece that's stock. Had mine for about a year now with 0 issues.
