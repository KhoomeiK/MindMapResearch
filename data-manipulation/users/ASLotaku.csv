At any rate, my previous understanding was at least partially incorrect, so I’m actually going to be appreciative of the correction. 

This is the problem with people from the states. Most high schools have minimized history classes. My world history class (literally the only class that would have covered any French history) was one semester long, and took place during my junior year of high school. We only talked about Europe for maybe 2 or 3 weeks, and they mainly focused on Germany during WW2 at that time. (Talk about WTF, right?) The other semester out of that year, for the same period was a government class. We only talked about US government policies. 

My husbands high school on the other side of the US was even worse if you can believe it. 

So unless your average American citizen recognizes that they themselves are undereducated and then choose of their own accord to better themselves, a lot of what I did earlier happens. We do not even know what we don’t know. 

I’m not going to delete my comment, because I feel like other thirty-something year old people could use to benefit from my own error."

Slightly unrelated note, I went with a co worker to watch Les Miserables several years ago when it was in theaters. During the part where everybody was throwing all their shit out the window to barricade the streets, my poor co worker (who had a bachelor’s degree! Not in history though lol) said “hey ASLotaku? What are they doing?” 

LOL her senior trip in high school was to France and she didn’t even know the major points that happened during the French Revolution were."

nosleep,fege14y,t3_ep042j,1579089434.0,"This is called schizophrenia. My in-law’s family has a history of this disorder. You do not know what is real and what is not. Your grandmother for all intended purposes looks real to you, and you are repeatedly told there is no one there. 

If it helps you, there is medicine to curb hallucinations like what you are describing.  There should be at least one outpatient behavioral health clinic somewhere in your area. These people will want to talk to you to get a feel for exactly when and how this happens, from a doctor’s perspective. They will be asking you these questions to try and get a feel for exactly which anti-psychotic will be right for you, and also analyze if there are other things (like therapy) they can prescribe to curb your symptoms.  A bad bout of depression can also make schizophrenia worse. So when you say you suffer from anxiety and depression, that really makes a lot of sense. 

Sometimes schizophrenia gets worse for many people as they age. So trying to curb it now with therapy and medicine while you are still young might help you greatly in the long run. 

Doctors will start you on very low doses of medicines, so you won’t be pumped full of anything unless they find out that dosage of that medicine really helps you. 

Try to remember there are people who care about you, even if it feels like no one does. You are loved."
