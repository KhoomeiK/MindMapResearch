I've heard it's more common in other English-speaking places like England, New Zealand, and Australia (where, even there, it's not even that common and it's more heard on women a good 20 years older than me), but in the US, it's basically unheard of. And I have a weird spelling to boot. If a friend changed their name, and they used the same name and spelling as me, it'd be pretty obvious they got it from me. And I would be extremely weirded out. There's a difference between a friend naming their kid after you, and a friend changing their name to be the same as yours. Especially if they then proceed to make comments like this friend did."
facepalm,ffj0cmm,t1_ffiu0es,1579987192.0,"No one is going to look at the Rock and say “he’s unhealthily obese and needs to lose weight”. But the majority of people who complain about the BMI scale are not overweight from muscle, and a few known outliers existing does not invalidate the whole scale. 

To be very clear, it is nearly impossible to be obese from muscle. Even pro bodybuilders aren’t obese at their show weights. Some of the men might edge into the low end off-season. But if we’re talking about the joint issues that come with being overweight, you don’t discriminate between muscle and fat. Overweight is overweight and it’s hurting your joints. Excess fat (which is possible at a normal BMI and a given at higher BMIs, outside of the exceptions mentioned) is associated with higher risks of many diseases, especially endocrinological disorders such as Type II diabetes, PCOS, and hypothyroidism."

I'm normally in the gym early (\~5:30-7am), but my schedule changed a few days ago, and today I was in the gym from about 8:30-10am. I'm just getting into my rhythm when two ladies come in. They're obviously surprised to see me there, but I just smile and nod acknowledgment and continue with my set. They keep staring at me and awkwardly walk around me to put their stuff down. Then one comes up and clears her throat, so I take out my earbud. Y'all, she wants me to leave. She straight up tells me that they need the gym to themselves, so I should kindly leave. I give her my best ""wtf"" face, put my earbud back in, and continue with my set.

Where I live, the base tax is simply spending 20% of your annual income inside the country, with a separate smaller percentage on medical (can’t remember the exact, but I want to say like 5-10%). You simply log some info into the national tax service website, and your bank, employer, and the tax service handle the rest. If you owe or get a refund, it’s simply subtracted from or added to your paycheck through your employer. You also pay a small percentage of income, pension, and welfare tax from your monthly paycheck.

UpliftingNews,ff7t8zl,t1_ff6ydfb,1579657804.0,"I think there's a difference in narratives. Many groups like the NRA claim ""all the Leftists"" want to take all your guns away.

Just like many on the left like to paint the right-wing as ""gun nuts"", when many of the more conservative friends I have agree with the same things above.

I didn't mind elementary and younger, but it definitely wasn't my preferred age group. I ended up with elementary, and now 3rd-4th grade is my hands-down favorite. I adore teaching those grades. Old enough that they're starting to come into their personalities, but young enough that you can get away with a lot of goofiness and dramatics.

But it also depends largely on the overall personalities of the grade cohort. I lucked out last year and had amazing 3rd and 6th grade cohorts. 5th grade was a nightmare. And this year, the 4th graders (last years 3rd graders) and 6th graders (last year's 5th graders) were the same as last year.

I’d be sympathetic to my parents grief if/when she dies, but not empathetic. She doesn’t mean anything to me.

It’s not even that I’m just apathetic towards her. She literally just exists as this person that I had to coexist with at one point in time. I have no feelings towards her at all.

That would only work if there were several options from multiple parties running. Many people run unopposed, or at least without any serious competition.

Congresspeople who have been in office for a long time tend to have better organized and funded campaigns than the new people, on top of the name recognition.
