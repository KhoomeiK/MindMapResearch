worldnews,feexew1,t1_feets3u,1579043307.0,">This referendum was explicitly billed by the Nationalists as a ""once in a generation vote"" in the lead up to it

Technically true, but context kind of matters. They described it as a ""once in a generation vote"" in the same way you might describe something as a once in a lifetime opportunity, not that they would stop talking about it for a generation (it's kind of a core part of their platform after all). In fact one thing they explicitly talked about as a basis for a second referendum if that one failed was Brexit passing

As for the 45% of the vote going to the SNP, that's actually an 8% increase in support since the 2017 election, so if you're using it as a metric for support for independence then that'd suggest an increase. Obviously that's not a good metric though, people vote based on a range of policies and independence might not be their primary one since the leading party has to deal with other issues as well (SNP hasn't been great on education, for example). The only party which gave a flat out refusal to even considering a second referendum though was the Conservatives, and they lost just over half their seats in Scotland.

Besides which, the argument here isn't necessarily for independence, but rather to have a second referendum to see if Brexit has shifted the position of Scotland. If it's still remain then fine, that's an end to that, but you can't deny that Brexit happening, despite significant opposition in Scotland, might have influenced the public's position on it. You can get an approximate number for that with polling, but a referendum is the only way to get a complete picture"

There's still a question mark over a non-binding referendum, which it's been suggested will be the follow up to this refusal as a way to put further pressure on Boris. That kind of referendum would be advisory only, essentially being a way for the government to accurately measure public opinion, but it's kind of a grey area as far as the law goes (it's \*probably\* within the powers of the Scottish parliament, but it's likely Westminster would try to challenge it in court)"

worldnews,fcogd0t,t1_fcnstlv,1577831571.0,"She's being held on contempt of court charges, because she refuses to answer questions to a grand jury about Julian Assange's involvement in her leaking information. Her position is she already answered all of those questions, under oath, as part of her own trial and the information is already available. 

The only reason she sees for them to insist on her testifying is so they can try and pressure her into testifying against him (they've given her immunity, so 5th amendment doesn't come in, nor does the question of charges for omitting things from previous testimony), and since it's a grand jury she would be very limited in what she could disclose if this would happen. As a result she's refusing to testify"

This was apparently for ""safety reasons"". After this she was served a second supoena, again refused, and was given an 18 month sentence plus a fine of $500/day for each of the first 30 days, and $1000/day for every day after that. Don't know if she's back in solitary or administrative segregation again though"

In this case, the advice they were given was probably that Google looks favourably on sites which update regularly, so they're trying to stick to a schedule even though they don't have the content to upload.

In this case, I'd guess Alex does a lot of behind the scenes work and this is a more minor part of his job, so he doesn't get the time to do in-depth articles most of the time. Easiest alternative is to follow the Buzzfeed model and reference other people's content to build your own (thankfully they're at least not trying to pass it off as their own and linking instead)"
