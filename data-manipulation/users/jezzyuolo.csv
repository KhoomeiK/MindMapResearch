thesims4,ffihda5,t3_ets1zt,1579973905.0,"I just added get to work to my collection the other day, and if you’re thinking of having a bunch of interactive career options it’s super fun! My favorite feature is probably opening up your own retail shop, but I’m looking forward to having my son become a doctor! 

To add something universal for every sim to the game, I would suggest dine out! Probably the best dlc in my opinion just because going out to eat at a restaurant that you design yourself is pretty enjoyable, and you can squeeze in a trip out to eat into regular gameplay! It adds a lot to the game for being just a game pack! 

The only thing I would wait on is get famous! It’s a really fun pack, but right now I (and many others to my knowledge) are experiencing a glitch that renders the acting career completely useless. Hopefully this is fixed soon, until then I would keep my eye on other packs. 

Good luck!"

Advice,fcvb0tl,t1_fcv4fh0,1577998344.0,"Okay, this adds a LOT more to the story. I’d say now that you’re just in a really shitty situation, and I can definitely see why you felt so pressured to say yes in front of your whole family. How do you think your family would react to your sexuality if you were to tell them? 

It definitely is going to be difficult getting out, especially since it has been 2 years of exclusivity. I can’t imagine your family will deal well with the “break-up” either, considering they are the ones who pushed you into marriage in the first place. I can see how you would also be in a similar situation if you had stayed single, and you must’ve felt more secure in having your family think you’re in a committed relationship with a man. I imagine, though, this has been extremely hard on you. 

You also said you “unfortunately” turned out to be a lesbian. I disagree with this completely. Although your situation is certainly unfortunate, I don’t think your sexuality is. It is a part of who you are, and it is something you have no control over. One day, I hope you find the freedom both in yourself and around you for acceptance and love. You deserve it, regardless of the position you find yourself in now."
Advice,fcuzseq,t1_fcuyazq,1577991763.0,"From the sound of it, OP is the one doing the ruining. She lied and deceived her partner ON PURPOSE for years. It would be different if she was sexually confused, but it sounds like she’s pretty clear on wanting to deceive both her partner and her family. I can’t imagine the pain her SO is going to go through. In his mind, he proposed to the love of his life and she said yes. He will be absolutely crushed. I have no idea how someone can lie to a person they are supposed to love and protect about something so huge for years and waste their time when they could be out looking for someone who actually gives a fuck about them."
AskReddit,fcuz7l6,t3_eiweq4,1577991448.0,"Met a dude on a dating app. He seemed nice enough. We ended up chatting for awhile, and planned to go out to a boardwalk. My dad surprised me with a plane ticket, so I had to postpone our date. I was really apologetic about it, and we set up another time to go. About a week into my trip, he kept telling me how “upset” he was that I had to cancel. I reassured him I only canceled because I had a last minute trip to attend. 

Giving him the benefit of the doubt (maybe he was having an off day. Everyone can be like that sometimes, including myself), when I got back from my trip, we went out. He paid for everything (which I appreciated very much). We walked around the beach, got some lunch on the water, and then went on a tour of a fancy hotel. It was a pretty fun day, but I got some weird vibes from him and the conversation stalled and left us in an awkward silence more than once. If I don’t vibe with someone, I’m pretty much done. I won’t force things.

After I got home, he texted and asked for a second date. I told him, truthfully, that I wasn’t really feeling it. I think I did it in a nice enough way, and I thanked him multiple times for the nice day out. 

He took it okay and left me alone for a few days, then messaged me again to see how I was. I gave him the obligatory short answers and didn’t really keep the conversation going. 

Everything was pretty normal so far. He then processed to ask me out again. I said no. He kept pushing. I kept refusing. I left him on read. 

He messaged AGAIN a few days later. I told him that I wasn’t interested, and I told him to please leave me alone. He got angry, and started begging me to go out with him. He said something along the lines of “I always get the girl to go out with me. Either that, or they block me :)”. I was really creeped out, told him as much, and stopped answering. The messages kept coming. 

“Come on, we could have a really great time together.”

“I’m a nice guy.”

“Just come for the free food and drinks. Don’t even mind me.” 

“You seriously won’t get anyone better than me. I doubt you can.” 

At this point I blocked him on everything. I was really glad I took precaution so he didn’t know where I lived. He gave huge stalker vibes, and if I went out with him again I can almost guarantee you I would’ve been drugged and raped. 

Always be careful when meeting new people, and make sure to always meet in public before going somewhere private. TRUST YOUR GUT."

It’s overall a really shitty situation. When it really boils down to it, OP made a split second decision to put his coworker before himself. In reality, this also meant putting his coworker before his wife and child. A messy situation indeed. 

The only thing I could see really changing this would be if OP didn’t stay at work when his wife went into labor. It’s only because of this that I think OP is TA, unfortunately.

CozyPlaces,fc9typw,t1_fc8ee9d,1577558184.0,"When the leaves start to droop, add water. You can also touch your fingertips to the dirt, and if it’s dry, add water.

When you buy a plant, typically they will have a tag on them that says if they need low, medium, or high sunlight. If it doesn’t have a tag, put in it medium sunlight and watch it for a couple weeks. If you notice the leaves turning yellow, brown, and crunchy, move it to low light. If you notice the leaves sagging when it has been properly watered, move to high sunlight. 

If the plant has stopped growing, or has started growing deformed leaves, it’s time to change the pot. Get some fresh dirt, and put it in a bigger pot. Remove the plant from old pot, shake the lose dirt from it, and be careful to to rip the roots. Place the roots and plant gently into the new pot and lightly pack the dirt around until it is secure. Make sure to water any newly potted plant! 

Most plants are completely unique and require their own special care, which is what makes gardening more difficult. Over time with these plants, you should start to learn what they like and don’t like. I would also recommend starting off with some easier plants, like ferns or vining plants that grow most everywhere and pretty quickly.

Advice,fc9q59h,t3_egt91n,1577556510.0,"Hey! This is a pretty shitty situation, and I’m sorry that you’re caught in it. It’s scary, and there is only so much that you can do. Here are a couple of things I recommend:

•First things first, know that this isn’t your fault. At some point, maybe you questioned your actions and thought that there was something you could have done different. From what you said about the girl he stalked in college, he would have followed through with this behavior regardless of how you reacted. Keep your cool, and seriously know that you are doing the best you can, and this is NOT your fault. 

•Something else very important: if you feel your safety is in jeopardy at ANY point, call your country’s emergency number immediately. Although he hasn’t shown violent behavior, even if you suspect or have a fear that in a moment you are not physically safe, you need to call for help. 

•Also important to your safety is talking to your friends and family about this. Send them screenshots, tell them his full name, and make sure they understand the situation clearly. If, god forbid, anything happens to you and they cannot get into contact with you, they have access to the situation and the information which could help immensely. They need to know the position you are in, for your safety. 

•Keep detailed logs of when you talk to him/encounter him. Write down times and dates so you know exactly what is happening, and you have a reliably log of your interaction in case you need to get the police involved. 

•If you haven’t already, block him on all the platforms he has access to. Any social media and/or his phone number. You have already made it clear to him you no longer want contact. Blocking is the next step. If he tries to contact you through other numbers/accounts, write down the information, and block him again (don’t forget to take screenshots!). If he persistently tried to message your social media, make your account private. If he persistently tried to contact your phone number, change it. These are worst case scenario failsafes to keep in mind, just in case. 

If you do all of this, there are two outcomes. Either he really gets the message and he leaves you alone, or he increases his stalking. Let’s hope for the first one, but if he continues to stalk you, you can go to the police with all of the information you have collected. This is worst case scenario, but it will really pay off to be prepared just in case this becomes a dangerous situation. And I cannot stress this enough: telling your friends and family your situation is extremely important. 

Good luck, OP. It sounds like you already are, but you need to take this seriously. As someone who experienced the fear of being stalked before, this is not something to take lightly. I’m sure you’re already scared, and this response didn’t help you, but just know that if you take the right precautions, it can change the game."
