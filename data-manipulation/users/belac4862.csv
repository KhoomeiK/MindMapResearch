Stargate,ffqqtt5,t1_ffqoykn,1580141506.0,"Done to me, done to your neighbor, done to anyone who has purchased an apple product. To put it simply they have preditory practices of manipulating their softwere that either forces you to buy a new product when an upgrade is not needed, or to have it ""apple certified repaired"" where what would normaly cost a couple hundred dollars, they then charge 1000$+. They are one of the most active lobbyist agaiant right to repair claiming security reasons. But those ""security"" reasons have been debunked by numorus cyber securty analyst.

They have put out softwear that will kill an old product to force new producs into the market. And despite this being a well known fact, they actively denied those claims or tried to discredit those who said anything about this.

What makes apple different than other companies that have similar practices is that they will claim nothig is wrong, then once enough people have found out about it, will then still charge their customers to have the issue fixed despite it being a designe flaw. And then on top of that they will still vehemently claim nothing was wrong in the first place.

The only reason why they have remained in buisness is because they charge exuberant amounts of money for technology thats no better or wors than anything else. You are pahing that money for a social status. ""I just spent $1500 on a new iPhone"" where money spent is a social status in of its self.

People need to stop product worshiping, and actually take a closer look at the product they are buying. Now i will say there is bad practices in almost all the tech companies. But you still have a choice of the lesser of two evils.

Here are just a few examples of why apple is a bad choice....
