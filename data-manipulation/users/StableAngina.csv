And I wouldn't say that it is purely a coastal problem. I lived in a larger city in the Midwest  and payed 550 for a studio in the basement. That was the cheapest I could find and I still had trouble making rent. Why didn't I move farther out? I couldn't afford a car and public transport was nonexistent, I had to be within biking distace of my job.

So yeah, maybe in the small to midsized Midwestern cities it's possible to find places for < 500, but this isn't true for the bigger cities. And the bigger cities are where the jobs tend to be. Yes, the Midwest does indeed have other problems, but I wouldn't discount this one either."

According to Wikipedia, her brother did believe her death to be caused by bulimia. But that's just it, it was a belief--I trust the facts and the medical experts over opinions/belief/wishful thinking. It can be very hard for people to accept the reality of their loved one's substance abuse (I know firsthand, unfortunately), and maybe insisting it was the bulimia that killed her made it easier for him to cope.
