Loads of girls are scared of weightlifting because they imagine getting a professional bodybuilder's physique.. That just doesn't happen, I guarantee you. Remember that diet plays a huge role too--a lot of women actually ""bulk"" first and then ""cut"" later to get toned, tight physiques. 



I would try HIIT classes, before my knees died on me that's when my body was the most toned. No matter how you work out, it's important to have proper form--otherwise you'll be targeting the wrong muscle groups. Nobody wants thick traps when they meant to target lats."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,felwbbr,t3_epfpti,1579232550.0,"I'm just sick of guys turning literally everything into a dating app. Just so fucking sick of horndog guys making me have to always be on my guard when interacting with any guy online under platonic pretenses. 



The things that count are never apparent on a dating profile, so I'm always extra selective when interacting with guys online...You can hide a shit personality and social ineptitude behind stupid puns. There's so much more choice, but it's a quantity over quality thing. I've used online dating apps for half of my relationships, and the ones that were the most successful with the best chemistry weren't dudes I met on Tinder."

AutoImmuneProtocol,fef5bwa,t3_eo8qh4,1579048537.0,"I'm sorry I don't have any advice, but my sister is going through the same thing. She's got IBD, and ever since she was born she's had oral pollen allergy (the thing where eating fruit or certain vegetables makes her mouth red, inflamed, itchy, rashy, etc). She was born all red and swollen with her eyes shut, and the dr had to administer some kind of medicine the moment she was born--he remarked that she'd probably have lifelong allergies.



She basically has to eat super bland unhealthy food, and I'm worried for her long term well being. Docs don't seem to care beyond vaguely diagnosing her with some inflammatory bowel condition that they don't offer treatment for."

2. Unplanned exploration or organized day trips? 

3. Public transportation required or no? Well connected cities like Barcelona are nice because you can take the train to places like Montserrat for day trips. 


4. Weather tolerance? Northern Europe can get damn cold, Southern Europe will be warmer. 


5. Unique experiences like seeing the northern lights, or just overall enjoying a place?


6. Socializing or totally solo?"
solotravel,feeyr22,t3_eot433,1579044167.0,"Careful with voluntourism--if you really want to help, the most effective way would be to donate money or goods to a particular cause--eg the money you'd spend on travel and accommodation. 


One of my friends had a tourism excursion company in a developing country, and he used a site to find western volunteers for free labor... It was just a way for him not to have to pay locals lol. 


THAT BEING SAID, I'm sure they're still in need of help for the bushfires in Australia. A quick Google search shows some ways you can volunteer https://www.gooverseas.com/volunteer-abroad/Australia http://givit.org.au/disasters/donate-a-service etc"
