There's a wall they put up to protect themselves from the thought that they were hurt. There's too much shame in that when the other path is full of pats on the back and being told you're a man now. Girls and boys get entirely different messages about sex and abuse; even the way we talk about the first time girls are made to feel like they're losing something and men are conditioned to thing they're *getting* something. So for a young boy to be offered this ""gift"", being ashamed or unappreciative goes against what they've been taught to feel. I've literally had to explain to a guy that he was raped because he went to meet a girl he met online and she drugged him before having sex. He argued that he would've done it anyway, so there wasn't a lack of consent, yet he had nightmares about the event for over a decade (maybe still does, idk). Guys deserve better."

He certainly doesn't care if I or any other woman believes he's sorry, because he's out trying to stage a comeback and go back to business as usual.

He's had a good career. He had the power and opportunity to take advantage of someone and he did. Multiple times. This is like asking an alcoholic to be a bartender and not relapse. He's going to do something shitty again because he doesn't really seem to understand what went wrong. He thinks he's just a creep and a weirdo, and that's kind of part of his brand, so he's gonna use it. I don't blame him for wanting to keep making money and doing the shows when there's demand for it, but I'm not going to praise him for it or think he's somehow reformed. True contrition would come from not being able to abuse more people, and he's not interested in that."

I'm not saying the dude is a monster or anything. I used to be a fan. I get that what he did isn't egregious in the grand scheme of things, I just don't think he should continue to pursue a career in the spotlight, and I think if he really understood or cared about what he was apologizing for, he'd already know that. I don't think he's stupid, so he either knows and doesn't care, or his head is so far up his ass that he thinks he's special enough to be exempt from the rules of decency."

No one's paying 100k to hang a song or movie on their wall either. Not all art is the kind of art that you hang. Not all art even lasts. Would you say an ice sculptor isn't an artist because at the end of the day it's a puddle and there's nothing to show for it? Art isn't for everyone. Sometimes it's for the artist alone. Sometimes it's for a specific target audience. 

You denigrating the thousands of man hours that go into making the background scenes, the character models, the lighting choices, *everything* in Call of Duty or whatever else you deem un-artistic is what's bullshit. Artists have to make money just like the rest of us.

Tetris was originally created by a Russian researcher working on Artificial Intelligence in the middle of the Cold War. He was trying to test the capabilities of the AI and discovered that the game he wrote was actually pretty fun and challenging. 

Art is allowed to be fun. The challenging part is what made Tetris a phenomenon. Everyone who's lived knows what it's like to try to set everything up a certain way to make your life work, only sometimes things come too fast, sometimes the pieces don't go where you want them, and every once in a while, it all comes together perfectly. 

Moreover, that song is iconic and both it and the game itself are a huge point of pride for Russian creators (and was even used as a political tool in the late 80s since the Soviet Union ""owned"" it.) 

It also has inspired tons of *other* art, which solidifies its place in art history.

Art can be simple. In ads, the 'message' is generally ""you want this"". It can also be complex. Video games cover every genre of entertainment in addition to inventing more of their own. Why can't art be enjoyable? (""Popcorn"" as you call it) Nothing says art has to be challenging or thought-provoking, only that it makes you *feel* something, even if that's just relaxed.

I worked with her, figured out how to calm her down (fireworks and thunder, she just wanted to be able to be outside to see what was happening, and then she was fine; the vacuum became a friend that gave her treats whenever it came out, but she had to take them from it, not me, etc.) She loved swimming after I showed her no one was going to pull her in against her will (something my ex did thinking he was being funny when she was a pup) but she didn't like stairs in pools, so only liked beaches/lakes/etc where there was a gradual incline. 

A friend of mine got a dog close to a year ago, and the dog was an absolute wreck every time he left the house. This is a big husky/german shepard mix, and he's destroy the house, poop inside, pull trash out and everywhere.

Do I need to dig up statistics for every factor? Yes, speeding does increase your chance of accident, it reduces your reaction time and your margin of error. 

The faster you're going, the more distance you cover in your ""thinking/reaction"" time.

> Drought conditions, or more specifically, soil water deficits, can influence the normal physiology and growth of plants in many ways. For example, when a soil water deficit exists, the result may be an increase of solute concentration outside the roots compared to the internal environment of the root. Such a situation leads to reverse osmosis, i.e. a net movement of water from the cell to the soil solution. As this happens, the cell membrane shrinks from the cell wall and may eventually lead to death of the cell. This type of injury can also occur when a build up of road salts or excess fertilizer occurs in the soil environment around plant roots.

> In the root system of a tree or shrub, the delicate root hairs that extend from epidermal cells and feeder roots at the extremities of the root system are responsible for the bulk of water uptake. Confined to the upper 15 inches or so of the soil profile, they are also the first part of the root system affected by dry soil conditions. With the death of root hairs, the water absorbing capacity of the plant is severely reduced.

Also, growth takes energy, something drought-stricken plants are in short supply of. 

> Plants rely on stored energy to survive during dormancy, and for initial growth after dormancy.Plants must rely on stored energy for unusually long periods of time when drought-induced summer dormancy is added to winter dormancy. Early spring growth that is stopped by drought or frost will deplete the plant’s energy reserves and reduce forage production potential the following year.

Even if that comment you're responding to were true, the plants that return aren't necessarily the ones that were lost. Depending on the time of year and a bunch of other conditions, the whole composition of these areas could change drastically, having ripple effects throughout the food chain.

Were not talking about these areas needing a couple inches of rain. Water needs to penetrate deep in the soil for healthy root systems to develop. A multi-year drought like what's been happening in Australia, Alaska, and many other places leaves the soil and plants exceptionally dry. That means fires spread more easily, regrowth is harder, and subsequent fires are more likely.

But there's lots of comments talking about how great fires are for the ecosystem, so it's fine!"
