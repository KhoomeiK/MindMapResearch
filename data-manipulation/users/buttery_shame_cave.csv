we specialized in things like port security, asset protection, various things like that. it was a neat job. 

the form we expected 'hostile divers' to take would be basically divers with commercially available equipment. the sort of stuff a terrorist cell would be able to put together from purchases at the retail level, expected to make direct action against a high-value asset/target via improvised destructive devices. 

basically, we'd set up an exclusion zone around something/someplace, where no recreational boating/swimming/diving could occur. if we had indications of any of those things we'd respond. signs of divers in the exclusion zone(which was extremely well marked and declared ahead of time) would get a couple different kinds of response. 

right around the piers we'd use ROVs with sonar to locate them(a diver would show up clear as a bell on sonar even if they ditched their noisy breathing apparatus) and basically act as a beacon for our own divers to retrieve them. 

if signs were spotted in open water, appearing as though divers were attempting to approach, we'd make a few passes at speed, being super noisy, and if the divers didn't surface, then one boat would break off and drop a string of concussion grenades along the expected route of travel."

water, being incompressible(well, okay it's like .05% compressible) will transmit the blast concussion without any real reduction in force for a long goddamned way. 

i was in a military unit that specialized in port and waterway security, and one of our tools were concussion grenades, intended to deal with hostile divers. we didn't really need to be that close - within a quarter mile and the divers were going to be knocked silly. within a hundred yards, the divers wouldn't be a problem after one or two grenades(standard practice was to drop a string of 3-5 grenades about 50 yards apart).
