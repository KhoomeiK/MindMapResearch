depression,fe0gktw,t1_fe0g4qw,1578813106.0,Thx I think I will I'm still in school (Hs senoir) so it's easy for me to find random girls to talk to. If I succeed I'll post it on here. :)
depression,fe0ei0a,t1_fe0dyf0,1578811892.0,Im about to sound like a incel but I don't really talk to girls that often cuase my anxiety just sky rockets at the thought of it. Even if it's just texting  or saying hi to a girl I know I'd rather not go through that. I often feel like when I talk to someone first that I'm bothering them and that I'm keeping them from better things.
depression,fe0dtk5,t1_fe0dgzj,1578811198.0,"I'd have to say I'm afraid of judgement. Like if I do manage to talk to someone I over analyse the conversation after it ends. I end up thinking that I somehow made a fool of myself. It's really irritating cuase I can talk normally if someone else intiates the conversation but I can't do it myself. I get really hot, I start sweating, I get itchy and even light headed sometimes. I hate it."
depression,fe0d0hn,t1_fe0co6g,1578810319.0,Man I want a true friend that can tell everything to. That I can cry with and hug. I need that kind of connection right now. But I have horrible social anxiety and I just can't seem to overcome it.
depression,fe09ql6,t1_fe06vjw,1578807071.0,I have been jumped before for literally no reason by guys I've never seen before. I think it depends on where you live cuase I was in philadelphia at the time.
