depression,ffeupse,t3_et6r7q,1579866372.0,This is beyond fucked up. I understand you don’t want your mom to go to prison but if you let this continue it doesn’t really help her either. She needs help as well. But most importantly you have to take care of yourself since your mom fails to do so. Do you have someone you trust? I suggest you mention this to authorities no matter how tough it is.
ForeverAlone,ffdbinp,t3_eszaot,1579817329.0,Maybe you can work on self improvement ? I know you achieved so much already but if something doesn’t work try something new? Do you go to a gym and workout? Most men goes for looks anyways.
SuicideWatch,ffd1z8f,t3_esu65u,1579811830.0,That’s tough. I can’t relate to your pain but I hope you find some sort of happiness even with all the pain.
ForeverAlone,ffcliq4,t1_ffc8wm4,1579802010.0,I fail 100% of the time when I try to read body language. Lol. Plus I try not to make eye contact with people try not to make them uncomfortable.   Idk I guess I lack lots of social skills still and need to work on them.
SeriousConversation,ffchmq4,t1_ffboqqu,1579799652.0,Thanks. I am too self critical in many aspects but I don’t think I am too unattractive but I strongly believe the society think so. Friends that I have usually put me down so I try to spend less time with them. Thanks for the advice.
SeriousConversation,ffcf5v5,t1_ffcedvz,1579798137.0,Thanks
SeriousConversation,ffcbm6m,t1_ffc8e13,1579795933.0,You are right I don’t know why I use the word girl. Maybe it shows I’m somewhat immature? I can’t go to therapy because I don’t have insurance anymore. But yea I probably need therapy
ForeverAlone,ffc7mau,t1_ffc49d6,1579793395.0,Yea I live in Las Vegas. No I don’t go to meetup groups. I started volunteering at an animal foundation though.
FA30plus,ffc5v02,t3_erjrfw,1579792240.0,I mean it’s more likely that FA have those kinds of issues than normal people. We have to admit some of us are dbags and that’s why they are FAs still.
ForeverAlone,ffbi81u,t1_ffbh2a9,1579766489.0,Thanks
AskMen,ffbfc8k,t1_ff9a0ly,1579762834.0,She should confront the guy and tell him to stop. Idk...I think it might be good for her in the future if she do this. After that if the guy still does it then report to HR asap.
ForeverAlone,ffbe3v2,t3_esp9ft,1579761398.0,I have the same issue. They probably view you as a pushover. Also are you skinny or too nice?
ForeverAlone,ffbdcun,t1_ffbd234,1579760561.0,Thanks
ForeverAlone,ffbd2zb,t1_ffbc8wn,1579760259.0,Anime girls can never break your heart because they are not real...
ForeverAlone,ffbd1rp,t3_eso39j,1579760221.0,I can see what you saying. If I had a crush with a fictional character I'll be like nah she is out of my league.
ForeverAlone,ffbcp4v,t1_ffbbzax,1579759833.0,Then which community should I ask for advice?
ForeverAlone,ffbchfl,t3_esmmpw,1579759599.0,I'm 30 and I approve this message.
SuicideWatch,ffbc55c,t3_esnoka,1579759232.0,My fear about suicide was that it's a reset button but I have to live the same life with the same issues. It's like a game and if you die (suicide) before winning (not suicide) the stage you get re spawned at the beginning where every obstacle is the same and the only difference is how you  will react to it. This turned me away from suicide a couple of times. I'm sure other people had this thought too.
ForeverAlone,ffbbqci,t3_esnqh0,1579758797.0,"Same. But when that brief moment ends and reality kicks in, i feel hopeless."
entertainment,ff9wg6d,t1_ff8yjw8,1579722999.0,Are you serious? He made earthlings and been vegan since he was a child. Eating meat is a necessity? Idk if you are trying to mislead or incredibly ignorant.
ForeverAlone,ff9tzpa,t1_ff4fdmw,1579721255.0,Hey it might be actually good and helpful. I just looked at one post I guess. But people seems to think it’s more positive than this sub. Go check it out.
depression_help,ff2qmpv,t1_ff2q2f3,1579519619.0,"I had a gaming addiction, so I am careful on which games I choose to play. I am playing zelda breath of the wild atm. Idk it doesn't help me to deal with loneliness but does help me with stress."
FA30plus,ff2l2n3,t1_feu3k0b,1579511148.0,I agree. Not being asked that question is worse.
ForeverAlone,ff2g5oc,t1_ff2g2ig,1579504715.0,"Oh man that place is even more depressing than this one lol. Thanks though. 
Edit: it seems like I’m wrong about this sub reddit and it’s a helpful sub."
ForeverAlone,fewmn7g,t3_eqookc,1579414846.0,You are not alone in your eternal loneliness. Many people here have experienced it before. And you know that no matter how hard it is right now you wake up another day and it’s better.
lonely,fesu7yk,t3_eqe6uy,1579369032.0,"Lol that must suck. I get what you mean though. My friend and his wife are overly affectionate even in public. It makes me a single guy for life probably, feel like crap and uncomfortable. I want to tell them to bring it down a bit, but idk if I should do that."
depression,fepyfie,t3_eq9z0g,1579334606.0,I made a promise to myself to never take my stress on anyone else. Your partner should be more supportive. You are going through a lot. Didn’t even came to my mind how females deal with depression when they are pregnant. Must be pretty tough. Sending good vibes.
lonely,femf5sb,t1_fem115q,1579252284.0,I can see that happening. But I guess it also depends on which country in Asia. Dating apps not popular where you live?
lonely,felnifx,t1_fel2zyd,1579226412.0,Where do you live?
lonely,felew04,t1_felen8j,1579220544.0,Oh you were talking about actual friends? Nvm then I probably don't have actual friends. I guess I have a high standards for friends. I'm sick of dealing with their egos and little jabs they take to bring me down. Having actual friends would be cool though.
lonely,felelmu,t3_eps7jt,1579220352.0,Imagine having toxic friends
lonely,feleiar,t1_felcdiu,1579220290.0,I have friends. That doesn't solve my issue though.
lonely,felef6c,t3_epghwg,1579220233.0,I don't know if people being genuine when they say girls have it just as hard as guys when it comes to finding someone. An average women probably have higher standards for men when looking for a partner because they have a higher pool to choose from because they get approached more. For example go in Tinder and compare a man a and a women with same average level attractiveness and see who have more messages in their inbox. Women have more to choose from so they can be selective. Just because they are not attracted to all the people who messaged them doesn't mean they don't have more options compared to men who have less to choose from so they cant be as selective. **Women don't have to like everyone who message them. It's just that they have a higher chance of finding the person they like because they have more messages coming in and more people to choose from.** it's more likely men be lonely than women.
lonely,felc2gf,t3_epl2mn,1579218668.0,Wow that sucks...my parents never hugged me either and said similar mean things. Maybe try to talk to them about what you said here. Maybe it will change their mindset. Let me know how that goes. Good luck.
lonely,felbp8v,t3_epoh1t,1579218423.0,Dude this has been a subconscious fear of mine. What if we all live in a simulation for one person and we are just NPC for that person's entertainment?
lonely,fehq3hj,t3_ep2wpg,1579121623.0,Maybe a healthy diet and exercise would help to offset that? Nvm that would only prolong my suffering.
depression,fehpxr3,t3_ep41xc,1579121531.0,Don’t think about it that much. I remember always being worried that people can see me being sad in public even if I tried to hide it.
SuicideWatch,feho4kv,t3_ep51gd,1579120486.0,The bitch must not die
depression,feh2p9p,t1_feg6804,1579107900.0,Need a little bit of humor to deal with depression.
depression,feg1ag0,t3_eoxun3,1579072654.0,I was just going to post about this. I had bad depression for a long time. Then I went to therapy and took medication which helped me with it. When it went away for a bit I felt really uncomfortable. I really missed the feeling of being depressed. But now I’m back at with depression and feels like home!
ForeverAlone,fea8elp,t1_fe9smoy,1578945578.0,"

Dude...thank you for saying this because I am sick of people saying ""Oh relationships are overrated"". You expressed my feelings so well. I don't care! I just want to know that I can be desirable for at least one person of my species. If that happens just once I could live my life in peace."
ForeverAlone,fea218n,t3_eo1mvo,1578943547.0,I feel the same way. It just the way it is and no ones fault. I don't really belong anywhere.
ForeverAlone,fea02ia,t3_eo724w,1578943015.0,I mean of course because if you are a below average attractive shy girl you will still get hit on but if you are a below average attractive shy guy it's way harder for you. But girls probably have other issues that factor into this like trust issues etc. idk.
lonely,fe9wxg7,t3_eo53x5,1578942200.0,"It's Naruto vs Sasuke. One never had love and gets to watch other people have it. One had love, lost it and gets to see other people have it. Which is worse? Idk. I'm Naruto and i feel despair."
lonely,fe6z95u,t3_enzj2k,1578908014.0,I don't even know how yall watching romantic animes. I get super depressed when I watch these because it just shows something that I can't have...There are so many great romantic anime movies that I want to watch and just avoiding at the moment.
lonely,fe13vw2,t3_encu97,1578822229.0,Nice it takes courage to seek help. I have your issues and therapy pulled me out of a really dark place. Even though things are still crappy I can deal with them much better and I work on my issues little by little. I wish you good luck.
ForeverAlone,fe11r8m,t1_fe06a9y,1578821486.0,"I remember setting myself a goal like that when I was in your age, but here I am at age 30 still alone but alive...Seek therapy if you can, it helped me out to have some hope. I like to pretend I am have given up on women...but I know I'm just lying to myself. I don't think humans are designed to live alone. It still hurts a lot though. I genuinely hope you find someone and be happy. I have experienced despair and don't wish that on anyone."
ForeverAlone,fe102sl,t3_enich0,1578820894.0,Dang no joke that's in the back of my head...we must all pray to our lord and savior Elon Musk to make A.I. gf a reality.
lonely,fe0jhgn,t1_fe04rlh,1578814398.0,Yea.
lonely,fe03p1l,t3_enfq7j,1578802285.0,"Yo I can relate also. But when I daydream about it, I imagine it as someone else. Even in my dreams it can’t be me lol."
lonely,fe03g92,t3_engfp6,1578802111.0,Same...I just want a hug.
lonely,fdu6z91,t3_en3zlz,1578728674.0,I feel what you saying but I'm kind of in the opposite situation. I never had anyone close to share things with it hurts pretty bad because I can always imagine what it's like. But mostly the good parts of that relationship and I crave it to the point that I actually feel pain in my heart. I'm worried about it because it can't be good for my health.
lonely,fdpsw2q,t3_emfkk2,1578639184.0,I agree. I have been working on self improvement for years now. It looks to me like relationships are not for me (I am already 30). But it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt so bad when I see couples sometimes. Its circular because I am super introverted and going outside would lead me to see couples and it would depress me more so I go back inside which lead to me being even more introverted. Sometimes seeing couples make me feel happy and wholesome though. I am kind of learning how to live my dreams through others like some fathers live their dreams through their sons...kind of creepy. They are all my sons lol.
