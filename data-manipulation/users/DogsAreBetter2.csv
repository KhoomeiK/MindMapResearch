It's not uncommon for both partners to feel like they do more, and her reaction makes more sense if she's feeling resentful"
relationships,ff6p3pr,t1_ff6nl4a,1579631931.0,"How often do you call her? Calling her at a time that works for you, but is limited, could also be a middle ground for you. My mother has a sixth sense for calling at the worst times and has never voluntarily hung up, and I hate talking on the phone. I call her when I have a free moment, but not unlimited time, like a lunch break or when I'm walking the dogs, that way there's a built in end to the conversion (break's over/I'm home/have to leave for something else). She feels connected, even if we talked for 30min instead of 90, and I don't feel as overwhelmed or guilty about hanging up.

Your girlfriend also needs to get better at hearing no and learning to back off a little, but that's obviously work she'll have to do herself. You can try telling her it's fine to be upset and hurt at the time, but she needs to manage that hurt herself, it isn't fine to shove it onto you to deal with."

Puppies enter a fear period around that age, she may have decided something outside is scary. It would help if you could figure out what, but you can still use desensitization training for outside in general if you can't. Personally, I'd look into rehoming the dog if the only other option was giving your mother a key to my house (10 hours in a crate is cruel), but as far as developing weird fears out of nowhere goes that isn't really odd for an adolescent dog."
relationships,fek2ijh,t1_fejx1ci,1579191227.0,"While I think denial is most likely, there is also a chance his previous doctors didn't explain what was happening or his diagnosis that well, or maybe hadn't seen him enough to feel comfortable making a diagnosis if he wasn't regularly seeing that psychiatrist. I've been prescribed antidepressants with doctors using a phrase like 'I think antidepressants will help, so I'm going to prescribe you some', with no further clarification. I assume they thought it was obvious, but SSRI's are used to treat a variety of disorders. I think I was depressed and that's why they prescribed them, but I also had anxiety so maybe that's why. If your bf felt his main symptom was anxiety and his doctor similarly skipped an explanation, he may just be confused."
relationship_advice,fehj27n,t1_fehelpp,1579117556.0,"Hopefully education will help. My only other thought is does having the door closed when you hang out with your bird mean that you're separated from your girlfriend for long periods of time when home, or that she's separated from her cat, and she's unhappy with this situation/having a bird around, but is expressing it through new found ethical concerns because those seem harder for you to argue against? I had a roommate who 'remembered' she had a childhood dog allergy after my first dog moved in and said she wanted me to return him to the rescue. Turns out she had no allergy, she'd just never had a dog and was off put by how needy he was. After some training and an adjustment period she grew to like him.

Your situation may be more difficult if that's what this is. Sometimes when each partner comes in with a dog, the dogs refuse get along, and it turns into a crate and rotate situation that even many dog people don't find sustainable in the long term (though some do). Afaik cats cannot be trained to be safe for birds, so you guys will never be able to hang out a as a foursome all the time, but that doesn't mean a compromise can't be reached on who spends how much time where if you're both willing to work on it."
relationship_advice,fehdrzr,t3_ep60ge,1579114469.0,"I'm confused, you're letting your bird free roam around the apartment with her cat? That isn't dangerous? As far as confining animals to a space isn't that what she's doing with her cat, unless neither of those are issues because it's an outdoor cat?

When dating I always took the position that my dog and I were a package deal, if you don't like dogs we can part ways. However, education on what a happy vs distressed bird looks like might help her warm to the idea."
relationships,fdrjpgk,t1_fdr17zf,1578685490.0,"I think your compromise might lie in that 3 hours part. Maybe she can keep her open door policy, but make the visits shorter, especially if it's not a crisis situation. I'd also ask her if she *wants* to stay up an extra 2.5 hours with a guest, or have a 3 hour catch up session first thing in the morning. It's one thing if she enjoys living her life like that, another if she just never learned how to politely tell people to gtfo after an hour."
DoggyDNA,fdhhbsv,t3_elfann,1578422649.0,"Cattle dog mix was the first thing I thought when looking at him. I also know a BC/lab mix with short hair like a lab, but no double coat, similar to Cooper except for his tail and coloring. Tbh, his percentages are so small and mixed that it doesn't really surprise me that they aren't pulling through really strong looks wise. 

I think you can ask Embark to double check that they didn't have a mix up processing your sample, but especially if they were accurate predicting a weight I can see this being right. 55 is already heavy for a BC, but some of those other breeds are bigger."

dogs,fcr59v4,t3_eijbs6,1577896973.0,"I agree with looking on r/reactivedogs for protocols you can use and involving a  professional, but I'd also stop taking her to the pub. Your goal with training should be to gradually expose her to triggers *without* pushing her to the point she becomes reactve/has a negative experience. If you're waiting until she's reactive to turn around, that's too late - treats are less or not at all rewarding to dogs in that state, and it can undo whatever positive association with a trigger she was forming. 

Sometimes it's hard to train close, but not too close, to a trigger in the real world. You may have to set up artificial situations to do that. Reactive dog classes can be great for that, but she probably won't be allowed in if she's human reactive. There are trainers who will work with you on fear based human aggression, but you will probably have to pay for 1 on 1 sessions. It's more expensive, but would probably be worth it to get tips on how to work with her from a professional."

dogs,fccshls,t3_eh28iw,1577602107.0,"7 isn't that old for a small dog. Separation anxiety can get worse with moves, but you don't mention that as one of his issues. Questions you need to consider are whether you will have the time to care for your dog, and the financial ability to handle 2 chronic conditions, as well as whatever else old age throws at you. Consider that if he lives until 16ish he will be with you into residency. If your parents will be devastated by his absence will they even give him up?

Honestly, it's hard to make a call. If they won't treat his skin condition and hit him to discipline him, tht sounds pretty unbearable for him, but he also sounds likely to bite a roommate if he's possessive and in pain. Assuming the scheduling and cost could work out, could you get a trainer to evaluate the behavior problems before you have to make a decision?"

Then both families get to do all of the traditional stuff with everyone present instead of having half the siblings gone bc everyone has in laws."
