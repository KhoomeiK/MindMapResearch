Read what I wrote again.  If you got rid of every immigrant, Canada ends up a much younger country.  NEW immigrants come in slightly younger but if the average age is 37 and you bring in 1% at age 32, what does the average age decline by?  (Hint it’s about 20 days).  Clearly immigration can’t solve our aging problem."

CanadaPolitics,ff6vtif,t1_ff6qiq9,1579635919.0,Not really true.  The average age of an immigrant to this country is 47.  The average age of a natural born Canadian is 37 according to stats Canada.  Immigrants can’t meaningfully change the worker to retiree ratio.  I believe it’s going from 4 workers to retiree to 2.1 and massive amounts of immigration improves that to 2.2.  Only affordable housing and more children can do that and the way to get that is less immigration.
