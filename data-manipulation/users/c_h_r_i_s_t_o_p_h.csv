apple,ffeyxe0,t1_ffeadjp,1579870837.0,Great to heat that you like the Moodistory! :D That is a cool idea because it adds information without any further effort for the user. :)
apple,ff5uz00,t1_ff5qr3v,1579611161.0,"Cool, thank you! :D That’s an interesting idea. I‘m thinking to add a kind of category-packs-feature, so users could choose which ones they would like to use. This way the default list wouldn‘t get too large and every user could compose a better fitting category list."
dataisbeautiful,ff2odfe,t3_erb294,1579516214.0,"So you watched 104 movies in 2019. That is one movie every 3 to 4 days.  
There are 13 movies with the highest rating (rating of 10), which is 12.5% of all movies watched.  
There are only 2 movies with the lowest rating (rating of 1), which is about 1.9% of all movies watched."
apple,ff2lxb4,t1_ff27165,1579512421.0,"Thanks! :) Yes! I wasn’t sure if it is really a feature that users want, but I got quite some requests about it and I‘ll soon start working on it. Current plan is that you will then be able to create an entry from your Apple Watch and see a list of the most recent entries."
apple,feykckx,t1_fexkyli,1579446684.0,Great! Awesome! Thank you! ;-)
apple,feyk0a9,t1_fexkpb4,1579446543.0,Thank you! :) I‘ve been thinking about that and I might switch to a freemium model in the future. But for now you could just buy it - and if you don‘t like it request a refund from Apple. Or: just write me why you don’t like it and I will try to make the necessary changes. :)
apple,fexd97v,t1_fexcs5o,1579429046.0,Cool! Thank you!
apple,fexcf68,t1_fexbr9v,1579428593.0,"The app works fully locally. Also the analysis is performed on the iPhone. That means that you could download the app, go offline into flight mode and everything will still be working."
apple,fexc2me,t1_fex7k8h,1579428404.0,Thanks for your suggestion! It‘s high on my priority list. :)
apple,fexburw,t1_fevfag4,1579428308.0,"I fully agree that data privacy is very important for tracking behavioral stuff. Since my app stores all data only on the iPhone locally, it‘s not possible for other apps or services to access it. Only when you create a backup, the data might leave your phone depending on where you are going to save the backup."
apple,fexawzd,t1_fev70zb,1579427894.0,Thank you so much! :D And thank you for your suggestion. Apple Watch support is high on my priority list... now it‘s even higher. :)
apple,feto98n,t1_fesqb8b,1579377532.0,"Cool! Thank you so much for you support! If you miss a feature, let me know! ;-)"
apple,feto417,t1_fesku3i,1579377472.0,Awesome! Great to hear that you‘re using it everyday! :-D Thank you for suggestions - already investigating the app icons idea! :)
apple,fes5jem,t1_fes3leb,1579361630.0,Awesome! Thank you! If you have any feedback - please let me know. I‘m really currently looking for the next feature to develop. :)
snes,feg1ht3,t3_ejkm1a,1579072893.0,"Umihara Kawase

Although only released in Japan afaik, it‘s one of the best platform puzzle games on the SNES featuring unique rope physics than make it really fun to play. It‘s is one of those games that I‘ve just recently discovered and which is great to play even if I haven‘t played it back then."
iOSProgramming,feg04v6,t3_eong94,1579071318.0,Congratulations! Downloading it right now! :)
bulletjournal,fefyc3m,t1_fefpsoh,1579069345.0,Thank you! :) Unfortunately it‘s currently iOS only. But I hope I can start working on the Android version in a few months. If you want to get a notification once a release comes nearer you could leave your email address here: https://moodistory.com/moodistory-faqs/#1574764682735-310e2dcc-ae72
snes,fefy096,t1_feeu7ip,1579068999.0,I see - very well done! I guess I have to do that also with my SNES. Wished though that one could eliminate the yellowish for good! :)
