AmItheAsshole,ff893l1,t1_ff87eer,1579669614.0,"It wasn't great. My father setup a hierarchical system that rewarded children that were like him and punished those that did not. This left my first sister to develop a Messiah complex. She was violent and cruel, and was rather fond of the crocodile tears, especially since anyone who would dare harm my father's precious angel would be punished. I have back issues from when he slammed me multiple times into a metal door hinge/frame as punishment for when my sister cried and said I harmed her. 

Her was violent, controlling, and narcissistic. As I grew older, his fondness for violence waned and was fully replaced by pure narcissism and control. 

The control led one sister to, in act of self-preservation, run away and live with a friend's family. The abuse caused her to become rather self-centered, at least toward family members.

My father had strict rules, but as I realized when I discussed the cruelty with other family members, they were mostly directed at me. I believe this came from me standing up for others he would bully, so it left a target on my back. He controlled when I would leave the house, how many squares of toilet paper I could wipe with, how long my showers could be (no more than 30 seconds; forcing me to go to school covered in piss). I was made to sleep in the same bed as him in the light. My family made comments about my genitalia to another sister's and told me that he would marry me if he was younger (told me this at the age of 16).

My mother was a mixture at times of oblivious and selfish. She wanted the money that she thought my father had and was willing to bear him as money children and sacrifice them in the hopes of returning to her lavish childhood upbringing. I can count on my hand the number of interesting conversations with her.

My youngest sibling went through far less of what any of us went to as my father mellowed on the younger ones in comparison. I became the scapegoat in all sorts of tales about why such and such person would have been better if I hadn't cried on my first day of kindergarten or healthier/skinnier if I hadn't spoke detestfully of hating cucumbers. I was an easy target and spoken of as a loser. I was not afforded the same freedoms as my other siblings and as such became a very awkward, painfully shy, oblivious, naïve person. My youngest sibling achieved in comparison because any advancements she made had been taken from others, so it helped further illuminate them. My parents (with my mother being the main one on this) didn't really try to nip her violent behavior in the bud because my mother felt it was too difficult for her, ""she will just cry more and make an embarrassing scene"", and because she had read in an article once that any fighting between children should never be interrupted by an adult. 

There were too many children, not enough beds, limited privacy, untreated mental illness, and a host of different issues. My father was able to play the good guy at times through disparaging stories of my mother and my mother's own lack of care or interest in her children. It was my father who would assert the need for checkups; my mother (who did take us to the appointments if pushed) found it all to be too much work.

Mental health treatments were not allowed because people would find out what was happening and each one of us siblings (except the two youngest, to my knowledge) suffered through bouts of suicidal ideations.

That was the kind of childhood environment we were raised in."
AmItheAsshole,ff7omss,t1_ff79052,1579654584.0,"My youngest sister was around 9 when she really started abusing people. She was much larger than myself (almost my weight at the beginning and then twice it as she got older) who was over 15 or 16 years old. She tried to drown our younger niece, beat me until I had a seizure, drew a knife on me when I tried to grab fries out of a takeout container I paid for, beat me brother often, spread lies with hopes of one of us committing suicide, would harrass you, steal your stuff, humiliate you, choke you, beat you with whatever was on hand. She was cruel. My mother gave her what she wanted because she couldn't control her. My youngest sister bragged constantly about how since she was so young, she could beat me with no ramifications and I would just have to take it otherwise she'd call the cops on me.

It's hard not to think about those moments for me and the utter cruelty. Do you think I should have put more work into my relationships with them?

She relished the age gap and continued the beatings because she knew that no one could fight back. My mother gave her whatever she wanted because she would harrass you for hours. She was horrid and it was hell on earth living with her. Not all children are little cherubs."

I should have clarified: it's not really an internship. I had this job before this semester hit and it was between taking the research course or counting my full-time position as an ""internship"", so I could have the credit and not kill myself with anything additional. I do agree though that I don't plan to camp at the position as it is a stepping stone since I would rather get into security instead. I think I should probably feel less guilty about the urge to take time off. If my workplace allowed for me to work from home more, I'd do it every now and then for a sanity check.

Thank you so much for all of the advice! You are right. It's hard not to think that all other sysadmin jobs must be like this. My boss and select others are willing to break their back and work 60 - 90 hour weeks both because they it makes them look good and because there is noone else. Our CEO seems to feel that you should be indebted to the company. CEO even used to call me all the time to chat about minute, insignificant things that need to be done tomorrow before finding out that I have a life and school to attend to. Now, he just calls my boss because my boss will not set boundaries and always lectures me on not setting boundaries. Other IT departments I have worked with did not try to kiss this much ass (this one is just me and him with him doing the development side)."

college,feget2e,t3_d2uhu0,1579090296.0,"I am in my last semester for my Bachelor's degree. It has taken me a long, long time to get to this point since I have been paying out of pocket.

With that being said, I work full-time as a systems administrator and have just gotten promoted, so I am working more hours than ever before.

I am taking 4 online courses this semester (I usually take three at most). I needed one elective, so I chose a information security course and was really excited about it until I saw the course.

The professor wanted a discussion board post to be posted weekly with an additional 3 posts in response to others. Each of these posts have to be done on different days of the week from each other, be 200 words, and have to have at least two references to receive full points with a grading rubric provided to be able to get your full 10 points on each assignment. The having to respond on separate days seems like it will be a stressful requirement to fulfill, especially given that all info sec classes that I have taken in the past have incredibly time-consuming labs and J have the most amount of time and am the freshest on the weekend (and even then have to sometimes work into the weekend, too).

There will be weekly chapter readings and labs every four weeks. These are okay, but the discussion boards sound like assignments from hell. Additionally, the professor considers ""lecturing"" to be sending walls of text of an already complicated subject, instead of lecture videos.

I reached out to him on what the format of the course is since I don't want to go through another course as a visual learner where the professor just sends walls of text on complicated material. He told me that there will be just a few videos that are short and that most instruction/lectures will be delivered through text.

I am considering dropping the course since it is my final class and the material seems to be a combination of professor laziness and busywork and going for a different class like sociology (checked and I have taken most of the IT courses offered this semester that I qualify for already). Should I do so?

Also, should I try to find a way to politely tell the professor that I really looked forward to the course, but having of be mostly text-based is less than optimal for me as far as retention and grasping of the material goes?"

The family vacations my parents setup for us were horrid. Usually, we'd all get sick. My father would make me do hours of programming in the hotel room before I could anything I wanted to do, if that ever even happened. The hotel rooms were cold and my father tried to fit a family of six into a single hotel room and someone would have to share a bed with my father.

The best decision I ever made was NOT going on vacation with them one year. I could go to sleep in a quiet house where there was no screaming or arguing between siblings and parents; I could actually have privacy and not have my father and siblings barge in while I was on the toilet or showering; I could read what I want, talk to friends, go outside when I want, finally get to shower instead of being covered in toddler piss snd not being allowed to shower due to my father's fear of any hot water being gone, get to clean up to where the horder house wasn't as bad or disgusting, and not have to fear where I was going to have to sleep each night in that massively overcrowded home two bedroom home, and for once in my life up to this point feel like I was actually human. I got to have a taste of what it would be like to finally escape that hellhole.

My father would do this shit of taking the modem all the time. The Internet was my ONLY way to get to learn about the world and talk to other since my father would kill all of my friendships and often wouldn't let me leave the house since they wanted me to be available at a moment's notice to watch their son. It was my only form of enjoyment because I wasn't really allowed to do much else. My father would take the modem throughout the school year and my grades suffered because I could never do my homework. 

If these parents were so keen on a trip with their kids why did they not broach it earlier (not everyone -- including teens -- like last minute)? Why not see what would make the kids excited to go? Retaliating when your children, who are not always going to enjoy the same things as you and not trying to understand what would make it fun fir them, is childish/immature and teaches a horrible lesson. Imagine if you went on a trip with someone that they wanted to go on last minute and they chose all of the things you did. This could be hit or miss, but as a child, the ability to have freedom away from family can be a much better vacation than some beach.

I am certain that it's frustrating to have kids that are not wanting to do different things, but the parents' response and their desire to punish for the likes makes me question their parenting. Things are not always what they appear."

My mother raised me as a vegetarian and I was always afraid to tell people or for people to overhear as you would have people who would make such rude comments about you and have to always preach about why meat is better and I should feel ashamed (or they'd place meat on top of my food).

MurderedByWords,fdwsmyc,t1_fdwec9n,1578761992.0,"I have been diagnosed with PTSD. The disassociations and violent hallucinations both during the day and night are some of the worst parts. I have shaken my boyfriend awake not realizing I was doing so because of a night terror. 

I feel like a boring person because I have to read parental guides for movies for any potentially triggering violent imagery. If I don't, the images get added to a morbid collection of imagery that prevent me from sleeping at night and being too scared to close my eyes because I am tired of seeing images of people I know or myself being brutally ripped apart (among other vivid, brutal imagery).

The disassociation I try to avoid fixating on it when I am in the middle of it; otherwise, I will have a panic attack and be too afraid to be near anyone because I am so out of it and will ramble about things I'd rather have not spoken about.

The freezing during conflict, being unable to move your body or speak are some of the scariest experiences for me. I am forced to sit there, tears streaming down by face, without being about to flee dangerous and escalating situations

The symptoms are something you don't forget and can't because as I have been told by my therapists, this will be lifelong. I don't want to gatekeep, but I also don't like it when people ascribe things to themselves in such a way that trivializes the struggle of sufferers.

If you claim to have PTSD, but don't actually have it, I would gladly give mine away if I could."

Bastards that came to visit my parents house time and again after multiple reports of child abuse wouldn't have noticed abuse if it was occurring right in their line of eyesight.

It's hard since everyone learns to cope differently, so I don't know if I have any good advice. What helped me was realizing that I thought about my failures more than anyone else did, that everyone has to start somewhere, and that I took it slowly and worked on going out and meeting people (which took me a while to better understand norms -- still working on it), but different things help different people.

I agree with the creepy guys comment. Most guys that would hit on me were these creepy, psychotic guys. I felt pretty unsafe.

It was especially bad in my teens when I was living in a dirty, abusive environment, so my acne just soured. People were downright cruel in school and would ask me out as a joke, make jokes about others dating me, mock me, interrupt me, trip me, and let me know just how ugly and dorkly they found me. It's not my fault that my parents squandered money, left me to scrape the tub for soap scraps and fill nearly empty shampoo bottles with water, and wouldn't buy me a lot of new clothes despite most of them burning in a fire and being left to wear hand-me downs from someone several inches smaller.

Nowadays, my skin looks healthier because I can buy myself soap, healthy food, can exercise when I want, and have less stress overall. The stress of being bullied amongst everything else did no favors for how I looked.
