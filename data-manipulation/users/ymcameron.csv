alternativeart,ff2e24a,t3_er3ck3,1579502324.0,"In the 1830s Yukon, William “Wade” Wilson was a fur trader with his partner Logan “Wolverine” Howlett; a man renowned for his short stature and even shorter temperament. One day the two were out hunting a family of beavers that had proven *particularly* elusive when they heard a noise coming out of the tree-line. The duo suddenly found themselves surrounded by a large group of bandits. Logan immediately sprung to action and while he was quicker than he may have looked, was quickly gunned down. Wade ran to his friend and arrived just in time to see his final moments. After watching his dying friend bleed out in his arms, Wade charged the group as well. He too was met with a bullet. Unlike his friend though, Wade was injured but not killed outright. The bandits told Wade to throw over his pelts, and in anger Wade spat back that they could take them from his cold, dead hands. The crew of miscreants informed him that they could arrange that. He reached for his rifle but the gang kicked it aside with little effort. Wade was in a bad way. They dragged his body to the middle of the frozen lake, made a hole in the ice, and threw him in. As his body sank beneath the water he thought to himself that this was the end. However, as the blackness enveloped him, instead of sinking deeper, he felt himself *rising*. Eventually even, his head rose above the ice. As his lungs once again filled with cold Yukon air he quickly noticed that things were different. For one, the bandits were gone, as was his friend’s body. In their stead were a pair of French Canadian ice fishermen, and it seemed *he* had been their latest catch. The two were terrified of him, for obvious reasons, and was compounded by the fact that the water, bullet wounds, and frostbite had badly disfigured him. The two men, terrified, ran off. Covering himself in the furs they left behind in their hut, he hurried to the local village, though that is perhaps a generous term, or at least it had been. When Wade arrived the town was larger than when he last visited it for supplies a month ago. He quickly discovered why. It *hadn’t been* a month, but rather *five years*. Confused and full of questions, Wade focused on the one thing he could make sense of: tracking down those that did this to him. His trail led him to the American Southwest where his wrath led to several more shades of red being added to the already painted desert. It hasn’t been all successes, several times his prey have gotten the upper hand; sometimes to a fatal degree. However it seems that nothing “takes.” Shooting, stabbing, burning, hanging, whatever it is, Wade always comes back. He has become something else, an immortal being of singular purpose: Revenge."
