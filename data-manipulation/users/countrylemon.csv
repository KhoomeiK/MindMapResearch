Second off, I've had both types of relationships.

They both work, it just depends on how much value you place on doing your hobbies together.

My ex and I (broke up for a separate reason) didn't share hobbies, at all. He was into cars, computers, a pc cames, I'm into gardening, console games, checking out cool restaurants. We'd ""sacrifice"" for each other, and it probably could work forever, because no relationship is 100% perfect so you gotta pick and choose where he weak spots are. We were fine with the sacrifices because they made our partner happy, which made us happy. However, always having to do one or the other and one person always sacrificing or visa Versa did cause tension and resentment, but you'd have to CHOSE to work through that.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN, my current partner, and considered love of my life, and I probably have 90% of our hobbies in common. And while he doesn't like gardening himself, he loves going with me to the garden centres because he fins a different kind of value. He gets far more excited about doing MY things with me, than my ex did. That energy means much more to me on a deeper level. Possibly because our odd hobbies aren't a huge deal because we have so many shared ones.

I think my concern for you here, is when either of you do the other's person's hobbies, is it begrudgingly? or is it with enthusiasm? That'd be the make or break for me personally."

RedPillWomen,fdhbwm7,t1_fdh6j2t,1578419625.0,"Preface by saying this is a bunch of thoughts slammed together, maybe you can get something out of it.

Yes I did! That's very important to me. I wanted to basically look at the guy, and want to take all his clothes off. I still do, 7 years later. So I'm glad I didn't settle for that because sexual attraction is very important to me and now that I have it, It would have been a very lack-luster, maybe even miserable life without it.

We started college and I saw him across the class from me and literally made it my mission to get to know him more. Took some real work but I snagged 'em!

Initially, he sort of pushed me into a friendly category while still flirting. This somewhat gave a tell that he's interested in having a relationship with me *in some form*, at first. What that ""form"" was determined after we got to know each other more. I wasn't RP then, so I kept trying to push to hook-up with him. He eventually said something along the lines of ""loook, I'm attracted to you, but I'm not going to have sex with you just because you're hot, I need to make sure you're worth it."" My blue-pilled ass genuinely was so taken aback by this and took it as a personal slight but it truly was just him vetting me and seeking value, I'm glad he did that.

I think it's fine to go after the people that turn you on, it's just a matter of not letting that be what steers the ship. I lucked out because I did it to a red pilled guy. That being said, men seek value as much as they seek pleasure. Find that balance so you don't get screwed over. 

I read through your post too and I think that might be a blurred line for you, attraction and when to act on it. That's what it was for me too, I think I jumped on dick becasuse I thought it would 1) fulfill my sexual desires and 2) improve my relationship with men, the instant gratification is what's confusing. I was also a serial monogamous too, skipping from guy to guy, all long-term boyfriends but still, no room for single young woman's self development. I also did the whole indpendant strong woman thing, college, fulltime jobs, still to this day - I'm sitting here at my 9-5, miserable (im on schedule to work part-time then SAHW). Hey I'm also 27 we actually have a lot in common. You're welcome to DM me to keep chatting!

RedPillWomen,fdh35ir,t3_elavva,1578414373.0,"Your problem isn't age, it's type.

I met my guy in college and he stood out because he has different priorities (ie. money and long-term success, not interested in casual sex). I also have a few guy friends who were the same, and yes, I do have some that are still nearly 27, that are still fucking and chucking.

There's just that weird grey-area where you have to decide for yourself, are you passing up a good man because of superficial X reason? Or are you settling on a decent man because you know he's a safe choice.

Unfortunately, he dated a very horrible girl after me and I'm not sure he'll treat women as gently as he did me and that's a shame. While I don't daydream of us being in love anymore, odd times I do find myself thinking ""I hope he found himself a woman who appreciates him. He deserves that.""

This way it's a moment to show him you appreciate all he's done for you, you can slowly chip away at the task for however long you need and it'll show gratitude.

By movie night, I mean go all out. Pick the movie, the snacks and drinks, o go along with it, put out your candles or rainbow glowing rocks (i have one, idk if you do) etc, bring a bunch of pillows and blankets into wherever you'll watch the movie. Set a mood, make a theme of it. (Harry potter night for a cliche example).

It's something you can work away on by yourself, it'll give you a bit of independence back, it can be chopped up into tiny tasks so you can do it when you can, and it'll be a calm and relaxing thing to do together. You can apologize for him having to clean a bunch of it up by smothering him in compliments and kisses.

Your approach in the situation was good.

Your wife is also correct that saying ""part of being a man is not crying"" is a rabbit hole.

Just ensure you teach Henry the difference between crying over being a little hurt and being able to handle it, and being allowed to cry to express himself.

Instead of getting him to stop crying, get him to figure out why he's crying and if that helps him in that moment or not. Instead of teaching him ""what to do instead of cry"" teaching him how to process the negative emotions and how to move past them while going through them.

Crying doesn't help when you can get a bandaid and just toughen up there.

Crying DOES help a 7 year old express emotions that are still confusing for him.

So you were wrong in the sense of saying being a man is not crying, but you were 100% correct that being a man is learning to overcome the inevitable hardships that come your way. Crying is what men do.

Change up your approach, you didn't intend malice, but your wife doesn't like the approach and there are different ways to go about it. Just watch your wording."

Second off, I've had both types of relationships.

They both work, it just depends on how much value you place on doing your hobbies together.

My ex and I (broke up for a separate reason) didn't share hobbies, at all. He was into cars, computers, a pc cames, I'm into gardening, console games, checking out cool restaurants. We'd ""sacrifice"" for each other, and it probably could work forever, because no relationship is 100% perfect so you gotta pick and choose where he weak spots are. We were fine with the sacrifices because they made our partner happy, which made us happy. However, always having to do one or the other and one person always sacrificing or visa Versa did cause tension and resentment, but you'd have to CHOSE to work through that.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN, my current partner, and considered love of my life, and I probably have 90% of our hobbies in common. And while he doesn't like gardening himself, he loves going with me to the garden centres because he fins a different kind of value. He gets far more excited about doing MY things with me, than my ex did. That energy means much more to me on a deeper level. Possibly because our odd hobbies aren't a huge deal because we have so many shared ones.

I think my concern for you here, is when either of you do the other's person's hobbies, is it begrudgingly? or is it with enthusiasm? That'd be the make or break for me personally."

Yes I did! That's very important to me. I wanted to basically look at the guy, and want to take all his clothes off. I still do, 7 years later. So I'm glad I didn't settle for that because sexual attraction is very important to me and now that I have it, It would have been a very lack-luster, maybe even miserable life without it.

We started college and I saw him across the class from me and literally made it my mission to get to know him more. Took some real work but I snagged 'em!

Initially, he sort of pushed me into a friendly category while still flirting. This somewhat gave a tell that he's interested in having a relationship with me *in some form*, at first. What that ""form"" was determined after we got to know each other more. I wasn't RP then, so I kept trying to push to hook-up with him. He eventually said something along the lines of ""loook, I'm attracted to you, but I'm not going to have sex with you just because you're hot, I need to make sure you're worth it."" My blue-pilled ass genuinely was so taken aback by this and took it as a personal slight but it truly was just him vetting me and seeking value, I'm glad he did that.

I think it's fine to go after the people that turn you on, it's just a matter of not letting that be what steers the ship. I lucked out because I did it to a red pilled guy. That being said, men seek value as much as they seek pleasure. Find that balance so you don't get screwed over. 

I read through your post too and I think that might be a blurred line for you, attraction and when to act on it. That's what it was for me too, I think I jumped on dick becasuse I thought it would 1) fulfill my sexual desires and 2) improve my relationship with men, the instant gratification is what's confusing. I was also a serial monogamous too, skipping from guy to guy, all long-term boyfriends but still, no room for single young woman's self development. I also did the whole indpendant strong woman thing, college, fulltime jobs, still to this day - I'm sitting here at my 9-5, miserable (im on schedule to work part-time then SAHW).

Selfish, selfish, selfish.

You're going to be married for the rest of your lives right?

That's the fucking plan, right?

Then wait another year, instead of inconvience either side of your family.

Have a courthouse wedding if you NEED to be married within the next year.

However, for someone, so eager to start thier own family, you certainly don't seem to give a shit about your current one."

Good luck getting her to ""obey"" you when you're essentially dead to her, which you will be if you keep trying to rule her with an iron fist. If she's in ivy league, she's a good fucking kid and you're a twisted asshole who thinks how she dresses directly correlates with her as a person.

You care more about the clothes she wears than your daughter herself, and don't you dare try to say otherwise because your actions have made that ABUNDANTLY clear.

Check yourself before you wreck yourself."

Your approach in the situation was good.

Your wife is also correct that saying ""part of being a man is not crying"" is a rabbit hole.

Just ensure you teach Henry the difference between crying over being a little hurt and being able to handle it, and being allowed to cry to express himself.

Instead of getting him to stop crying, get him to figure out why he's crying and if that helps him in that moment or not. Instead of teaching him ""what to do instead of cry"" teaching him how to process the negative emotions and how to move past them while going through them.

Crying doesn't help when you can get a bandaid and just toughen up there.

Crying DOES help a 7 year old express emotions that are still confusing for him.

So you were wrong in the sense of saying being a man is not crying, but you were 100% correct that being a man is learning to overcome the inevitable hardships that come your way. Crying is what men do.

Change up your approach, you didn't intend malice, but your wife doesn't like the approach and there are different ways to go about it. Just watch your wording."

They were weak enough they broke a long time ago.

All you simply did was plant new roots.

Your family can go fuck themselves.
