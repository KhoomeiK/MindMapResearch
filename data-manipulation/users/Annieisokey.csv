declutter,ff47gg9,t3_erjj8q,1579557201.0,"Of you have IKEA (or if not, you can still check this out on their website), I recommend their series “SKUBB”! I often dedicate a whole drawer or shelf to this (but if it gets too crowded I move one kind of clothing to similar stuff instead) 

This might be similar to using baskets as I see people mentioned, but the SKUBB compartments are of great sizes especially for socks, undies, tights! 

They are perfect for most drawers or closet shelves, very Tetris-like to place after your space and needs. You buy a set with some smaller cube shaped compartments (good storage for rolled mesh bras, your finest lingerie etc) and some longer rectangular (folded or rolled tights, or sport/winter/special socks) and a big squared one (perfect for bras in a row! or just pour in all your every day socks)"
