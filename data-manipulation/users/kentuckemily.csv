dogs,ffhfo6h,t1_ffhfheg,1579933266.0,He’s a year old. By let loose I mean my bedroom and he pretty much sleeps throughout the night with me. He will get me up if he has to potty. It’s generally during the day when I’m in the house doing something. And yes when I find a puddle. I spray and practically soak but they still keep coming back to the same spot.

dogs,ff43qle,t3_erjpef,1579554881.0,"I think you’re just freaking out because it’s a new animal and it’s been just you and the cats for sometime. The separation anxiety will most likely go away when he gets more comfortable, he’s probably seen a lot of homes or has been with one owner his entire life but either one of those situations produces anxiety for a new location. I have a senior pup and they are the easiest to take care of. She naps most of the time, goes out and explores in the fields (I love in an extremely rural area), and plays with my other pups when she feels like it. I would hate for him to go back to the kennel, it’s not a fun place to be for a senior dog since most folks look to adopt a younger, more playful pup. You’ve given him a chance to live out his days in happiness and love! Terriers can live up to an old age too. I say just give them all some time to adjust, your cats will come around to him and may even grow to love and play with him! Take a breather, it’s going to be okay!"
