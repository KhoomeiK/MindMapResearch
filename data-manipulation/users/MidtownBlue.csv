Model3,fewnoa0,t3_eqr7q4,1579415985.0,"We got so confused with the financing piece that we had to postpone the delivery. Turned out to be a lot easier than one thinks. In retrospect, we approached the whole thing the old fashioned way. We wasted all this time trying to get the bank or Tesla give us the first piece of document (be it a VIN number or loan approval) so we could proceed. Actually, ALL we needed to do, once we have initiated the loan application and the bank needs the VIN number, was to fill out the #tesla financing form--Tesla took care of the rest."

AskReddit,fc1kjey,t3_efoe5k,1577321515.0,"I have a couple of solid external drives with files I'd like to access. Both of the micro USB ports are rickety, but the Firewire 800 plug on one and  Firewire 400 port on the other work great. I've had a hard time finding converted (to USB C yes, but not to USB 2). Should I just ditch these drives?"
