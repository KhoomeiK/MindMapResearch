Portland,ff54lhs,t1_ff4go2z,1579580074.0,"Yet here you are, all with ridiculous ""Anarch"" screen names. If it was my post here, fine. But I got 50+ down votes on a bunch of posts and in less than 2 minutes.

Sounds like you creeps are censoring people stating the obvious: Antifa puts up these flyers to scare people."
college,ff2eqsq,t1_ff2c000,1579503089.0,"Seconded. You learn more if you actually write stuff down.

I use headphones with noise cancelling and brown noise from YouTube to study in busy areas."
college,ff26hok,t3_er7qcl,1579495182.0,Depends on the classes. I've had 13cr semesters that have killed me (nearly literally) and did 19 cr last semester and was fine.
college,ff25wdt,t1_ff1vop3,1579494689.0,"They are harder, but you'll be better educated when you take them. 400 lvl courses when you are a senior feel comparable to 100 lvl when you are a freshmen."
Portland,ff04yey,t1_fevrort,1579465296.0,"Well lets see, Antifa is mentioned and suddenly, in the course of 2-3 minutes, all my posts across 10 threads are marked with -6 to -15 downvotes.  Let me see, how could I possibly think this is organized cyber nonsense.  

And, by the way, despite being the most corrupt party in US history the Republicans are poised to win in 2020 precisely because the left has no moderation."
Portland,fevkzg6,t1_feu553p,1579398661.0,I really don't care what a terrorist website says. I'll take information from real journalists and experts but I sure as hell won't take it from Fox News or a group that attacks elderly people in the street.
Portland,fevkmmc,t1_feuwna4,1579398516.0,You think that attacking someone on the web and mob down voting real discourse is going to help you win against these guys? You're a fool.
Portland,feu26yo,t3_eqlkht,1579382399.0,"I wonder if it is a hoax? We are in the process of moving to Portland, so I don't know the scene, but in ABQ ever had a bunch of fake white supremacist flyers and Facebook events.  No events or meetings ever happened, just flyers. ABQ PD said they thought students were involved. Ymmv"

politics,fersi5h,t1_fer7537,1579357871.0,"Your mob is as much the problem as the Republicans. I worked for Bernie in 2016, you really can't get less homophobic than me. While simply trying to rationally discuss the unfounded fears of the right your mob goes on a down voting spree and threatens, via PM to kill me.

This sort of vitriol as purity test isn't progressive."
politics,fep6ald,t1_fen6hok,1579313093.0,"Dude, my bad. I even love that part, with the cannibals etc..."
politics,fep62g0,t1_feozype,1579312945.0,"That's absolutely true, but only to an extent. None of these events background checked the performers (as I understand it) and it seems like the gross misunderstanding on the right, that all drag performers are perverts, is being counterbalanced on the left with none are.

From the perspective of the right this is evidence of their worst fears, right along with underage boys performing at gay clubs (see: DragKids) and men's fetish stores using underage models. They aren't overreacting to nothing, even if they are overreacting hugely."
politics,feozbkj,t3_eq3zpi,1579308658.0,"I support these events and brought my 3 year old to one recently. However, it is worth considering that the Republican over reaction is to something, not nothing.

politics,fe4e4k5,t3_enn6um,1578858349.0,The problem is Sanders isn't a Democrat. Of course the party doesn't want him.

college,fdip2c8,t1_fdi86kc,1578447850.0,"So, at the start of term I created a Master assignment list for all my classes organized by due date and loaded all rehearsals, class meetings, and performances into Outlook calendar.

During term I'd wakeup 2 hours before my family and have coffee and review my schedule and start working on my most important readings.

Then I'd go to school and practice 2-3 hours and then start going to my classes.

My wife would bring me supper between classes and evening rehearsals and I'd play with my son.

Then I'd go to rehearsal and when that was done I'd check off my checklist, high light my most important things to work on and just try and get organized.

Honestly, it was hard but not complicated. You just have to keep working all day, nonstop."
college,fdgwnqn,t3_elbvr8,1578410166.0,"At my last school I performed with be a professional Opera company, took 19 credits, and did my part of the parenting of a 3 year old autistic child, all while working. It can be done if you just stay organized.

The other part is that I ended up with pneumonia and in the hospital after sleeping only 4 hours a night for 16 weeks.

It wasn't worth it."
