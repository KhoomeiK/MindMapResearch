PoliticalCompassMemes,ffltxun,t1_ffltmla,1580044170.0,"i would say they push them towards both auth and left, since it’s all done through increasing the power of the state

vexillology,fflqgzt,t1_ffllbmo,1580042772.0,"From Wikipedia
>	The non-aggression principle (NAP), also called the non-aggression axiom, the anti-coercion, zero aggression principle, or non-initiation of force, is an ethical stance asserting that aggression is inherently wrong. In this context, aggression is defined as initiating or threatening any forceful interference with an individual or their property. In contrast to pacifism, it does not forbid forceful defense."
