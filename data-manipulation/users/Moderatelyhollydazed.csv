Visiblemending,fecni12,t3_eogml2,1578978357.0,"Sorry, I didnt take a before picure! I stumbled across this sub as I am stumbling towards a zero waste lifestyle. I normally thrift all my clothes, and actually got this sweater at a clothing swap and just loved it! It started wearing in the neck and I stopped wearing it because it looked unkempt. 

I'm really happy with how it turned out. I used only materials found in my house ( 100% cotton yarn and a needle out of a dollar store pack my husband bought maybe 5 years ago."

EDAnonymous,fbuv2rb,t1_fbtn2oi,1577120828.0,I don't know my last scale used to give me a range of 9lbs at any given time. Like I could step on the scale repeatedly and get 4 very different weights. This one gives me the same weight each day even if I don't like what it says and re weigh myself immediately. It doesn't change even by a 10th of a lb.
