On the other hand the victors write history and he did get murdered by political rivals."
Homebrewing,ff6g1vu,t1_ff5ufdh,1579626414.0,"Generally I don't bother. Hit the temperature to start and wrap the kettle in insulation. It only drops a few degrees over the mash time, and as others have said it mostly only matters in the first 15 minutes when the temperature has barely changed. So while it doesn't seem to be necessary, other people do have all sorts of fancy systems to precisely control temperatures throughout the entire process."
dogs,feeqbz5,t3_eoru6l,1579038968.0,"You can't know exactly but you can estimate the final weight. Search for puppy weight charts, you can add in large breed or the specific breed for more targeted results. 50% is quite low for GSDs or labs, 75% is more typical. That'd put his final weight around 66 lbs."
dogs,fedp7y2,t1_fedmpv4,1579016898.0,"I should probably add, I don't know anything about the little pistol looking paintball guns that use gas cartridges instead of a tank. I always thought it would be fun to carry one during games as a backup, but they cost several hundred dollars, aren't that small, and use non-standard ammunition and disposable co2 cartridges. So I never got one, I never even saw another player with one."
dogs,fedmoju,t3_eofqgj,1579015269.0,"I'm guessing pit bull and dachshund. Pit bull because almost every mixed breed is 30-50% pit and her coat, head shape, and size go along with that. Dachshund (I could be totally wrong here), because the way she stands and the curve of her back and tail. As always, a DNA kit is the way to know for sure, and then post on /r/DoggyDNA because it's interesting."
dogs,fedlw90,t1_fedjw51,1579014743.0,"As someone who owns paintball guns and used to play regularly, the idea doesn't seem practical. Setting up and using a paintball gun takes your full attention. It's a heavy bulky thing to carry around, the gas cylinder needs to be charged, most guns have to be carried a certain way so the hopper doesn't spill, you should chrono it every day for safety, and so on. Plus you should only fire a paintball gun in an area where everyone is wearing a mask. Most fields net off the whole play area, spectators and judges either wear a mask if they go in or stay outside the safety netting. You shouldn't be firing one in a random neighborhood, and certainly not at a dog. And finally you'd probably miss or it wouldn't break on their fur.  
  
Like others are saying, carry pepper spray, call animal control every time you see a loose dog. Most people will get tired of picking their dogs up from the shelter eventually."
comics,fedkm6i,t1_fedgc83,1579013872.0,"Funny enough, almost every way we have to generate electricity is pushing a turbine around. Either something spins the turbine directly, like wind or water, or you make steam. Our high tech world is surprisingly low tech sometimes.  
  
There's a ton of energy in waves and tides but we can't figure out how to efficiently harvest it because it doesn't work to make steam or spin a turbine quickly.  
  
I haven't been keeping up with solar, maybe the plants work directly off panels now. But it used to be they were going to work by concentrating the solar energy to heat something up and generate steam."

dogs,fedgode,t1_feaw3sl,1579011030.0,"I have a family member who's like that, 3 kids and 2 older dogs, but I don't think it's that bad. The dogs can go inside and out at will so they spend plenty of time with people, they go along if someone's going for a walk or run or they can join in when the families playing in the yard or having people over. The dogs are never the focus but it seems to me they get enough companionship and activity to have a decent life."
nottheonion,fdnreof,t1_fdnoxeq,1578591345.0,"IIRC the virginity thing has to do with ownership of women and their ability to have sex. They're only allowed to have sex when given permission by the male patriarch in their life, their father or husband. Presumably the father won't give permission since she's unmarried when he's in charge of her, so if she's not a virgin at marriage something has gone wrong."

They made it the national bird because it looks cool and then projected a bunch of traits on it it doesn't possess because it doesn't care about any of that. It just wants to survive and if it learns getting food from people is easier than catching food, that's what it will do."
dogs,fdnbsyk,t3_em64cv,1578582391.0,"It feels kind of stupid to do, but brushing your dogs teeth isn't difficult. Once a day, takes about a minute, prevents most tooth issues. I do it right before feeding, which seems even stupider since they're about to dirty their teeth. But it doesn't matter when you brush their teeth and they're distracted by the imminent meal so it's easier."

AskReddit,fdn8960,t1_fdmqszx,1578579946.0,It tastes awful either way. If I had to decide I'd say the ketchup makes it even worse. Dollop of cold sugary tomato on top of the mushy mass of meat and bread.
dogs,fdkyt2k,t3_elvlmk,1578513958.0,"I don't know if I was ready. But I bought a house and thought hey, I can have pets now. So I got a cat and dog about a month later. Pets take a lot of time and money and you're stuck with them for over a decade (hopefully), so you should be having second thoughts. If you can take a cat or dog home without some doubt you probably don't know what's involved in properly caring for them."

You mention goldens and pit bulls, those are both fine. Shelters are constantly full of pit mixes that need homes, the only trick is finding one that the previous owner didn't screw up too badly.

I think any dog breed is likely to eat the rodents and reptiles if you leave them unsupervised, so plan to keep them apart."

Homebrewing,fdhg8lm,t1_fdf3ycs,1578421989.0,"I'll second this. DIY seems cheaper because you buy less stuff to start, and you can get a few things used like the fridge. But after I was finally satisified with my setup I went back and added it all up, I saved no money over a brand new commercial kegerator.  
  
There are advantages to DIY, customization, more taps, whatever, but I do not think money is one of them."
Homebrewing,fdheneq,t1_fdh9y44,1578421036.0,"Dish soap's fine, it's what I use. I only use pbw for the big equipment. Some people don't like soap because they say it leaves a residue which affects head retention. Rinse well if that's a worry."
Homebrewing,fdh9iwk,t1_fdh8p30,1578418300.0,"I haven't used Northern Brewers Cleaner/Sanitizer. But in general with no rinse sanitizers like star san you have your equipment cleaned and ready to use, and then sanitize right before you use it. Dip it in a bucket, spray with a bottle, etc. Then use it right away while it's still wet, don't wait until it dries and don't wipe off the sanitizer with a sponge or rag.  
  
For cleaning I use a sponge on plastic, brillo pad on metal, and soap or pbw. Post brew clean everything as you go, let it dry and store somewhere clean and dry.  
  
You mention star san post brew. Star san is not for cleaning, it's only a sanitizer."

funny,fd2k8yu,t1_fd2hz23,1578148423.0,I haven't had to train a dog away from resource guarding so I don't know. Search resource guarding or talk to your trainer about it. In this case though the dog's been set up for failure. Giving it a whole cake in the middle of pack of other dogs is kind of dumb.
funny,fd2cqv4,t1_fd1u5aj,1578145331.0,"That's not the safest way to correct this behavior. You risk teaching the dog that growling is bad, what you want it to learn is guarding is bad. If you train away the growling and not the guarding it can skip to attacking or biting with no warning."
funny,fd2c4o7,t1_fd22qev,1578145073.0,"The pack theory has been thoroughly debunked and is not a useful way to interpret dog behavior. It's resource guarding, the dog views the cake as valuable and doesn't want anyone else near it."

Just recently I was looking at golden rescues and saw lots of blanket reject policies. No dogs to families with kids, cats, must already have a dog, must have a fence, etc. One said the fence has to be 6 foot tall around the whole yard. Which got me to noticing fences as I walk my dog, I still haven't found a yard with 6 foot all around near me (plenty that have sections that tall).  Another said you can't use a retractable leash.  
  
I suppose it makes them feel better since there's no way to measure what's actually important, will this new owner devote the time and attention to this dog that it requires."
