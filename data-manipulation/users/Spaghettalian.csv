theevilwithin,ffbacd1,t1_ff933t2,1579757246.0,"I would say to just go for it, my guy. You've gone too far to give it up for one achievement. :-( lol

I watched JigzawKiller's walkthrough guide on youtube and while I didn't do EVERYTHING that he did the exact same way I generally did most of it the same way and it helped me barely use any ammo for awhile.. I'm at CH 9 with like 40+ herbs and 200+ gun powder. Resource management really isn't that bad, you can honestly avoid/evade most enemy encounters to begin with and really don't have to loot every single area during the more open free roamy parts."
theevilwithin,ffba80z,t1_ff9mtbh,1579757097.0,"All of the above, plus I've read that the fan base generally has not warmly received any of the game's DLC unfortunately. I really enjoyed the keeper DLC and the kidman DLC wasn't bad, it fleshed out her part of the first game's sequence of events but meh.. lol"

theevilwithin,ff91lxd,t1_ff90nov,1579702574.0,"You should do it, man. It might initially seem like a super annoying thing, and it is pretty rough at times but it took me maybe a week of playing on and off to get to CH 9 and since then I could've probably gotten close to the end or beaten it by now if I didn't take a few days break from it. You might as well give it a try at this point!"
theevilwithin,ff8zk9i,t1_ff8yxd3,1579700979.0,"That's weird to me.. The no damage achievement was probably way easier for me to do than the torment is proving to be currently. <_< 

I feel you on that. I've gotten up to chapter 9 just before the cabin fight and it took me hours, mostly because after the first dozen tries it started to consistently freeze 50%+ of the time right after I'd be going through the gate to knife the second ""art"" piece statue, that must've ended two or three dozen 15-40 minute runs... Collecting all of the stuff in the city level just to go to the hotel/devil's taproom and it crashes.. lol..

Now I gotta just make time to get through the cabin, going to torres' safe room, then stealthing through the lab and the o'neal fight to save in the CH13 hotel. It sounds like a lot, but I'd only be worried about the cabin and o'neal fights and I'd say that at that point the rest of the game shouldn't be too bad although I hear that the firewalk crashes so that'll be fun too."
dating,ff8z3ws,t1_ff8ulgy,1579700617.0,"Well, some may be intimidated. I have no idea why.

But yeah, exactly that. Any guy who values his time will write off the like 1% of women who are like 6 foot or taller as a waste of their's.. Taller women tend to have complexes about their height and seem to base their and other's self worth as human beings on how tall they are. 

Oh, you're 6'4? Go find someone from the like 1% of dudes who are 6'4+ and hopefully one of them is actually physically/mentally compatible with you rather than you just sticking with them because they're actually tall enough to not make you feel manly/freakish... 

I do feel for really tall women. Sucks to be them since their pool of acceptable partners is so very small. A really curvy tall girl is a sight to behold, though."
theevilwithin,ff8gae0,t1_ff88pia,1579677172.0,"Well, you just gotta make sure your traps are fully upgraded, lay two down in the one narrow area where there's the ceiling trap, and just trap him there three times. You can literally kill him just by doing that, it's basically what I did. No need to fight him, really."
theevilwithin,ff882so,t1_ff85szr,1579668705.0,"Clearing the executioner with no damage is actually not impossibru... You can beat one boss without getting hit, then immediately save your game. Kinda like with Mega Man 9.. 

The low-key hardest achievement is completing all torments and I think that it has the lowest % out of all of the DLC achieves and the achieves in the game in general (alongside the buying every weapon achieve because you need to get the torment achieve to unlock all weapons)....

One of the torments is to complete the final hidden execution chamber which will force you to fight the majority of the bosses you've already fought alongside endless waves of lost until you beat all of those bosses, and then fight Sebastian and Joseph simultaneously, both of whom can basically 3 shot you from the get-go and both of them can tank all 10 of your rocket launcher shots depending on how the game happens to register your hits on that particular attempt. The bosses are honestly not hard, but it doesn't matter because Seb and Joe are fucking nuts. <\_<

Even if you down Sebastian (as I THINK I have once or twice but couldn't tell that he wasn't hiding behind the damn bus) you can easily still die to Joseph. I saw a video where a guy put a butt load of mines down in a bunch of places so that I assume they'd spend more time shooting at them even if they wandered off, and that might be a game changing strategy but I haven't bothered to try... Maybe this weekend.

I really need to beat it so I can 100% the achievements for the game... I'm literally like two or three achievements away from completing both the first and second game. So frustrating and depressing.... Doing my classic mode run for EW2 right now, then I just gotta unlock/upgrade all weapons in a nightmare run. Other than the keeper torment achieve I just need to do a kurayami run and that's it.. ;\_;"
theevilwithin,ff87s81,t3_es63ue,1579668448.0,"I don't think that it's so low because it's super difficult, I think that unfortunately the majority of people who own the game don't play the entire game through, don't go for any out-of-the-way achievements or collectibles, and most probably don't even touch the DLC or care about it. :-s Maybe a lot of people have bought the game and barely/never touched it. A real shame...

I don't think that 95% of the achievements are actually difficult for the average person, yet most of them have less than 1% of players unlocking them.

Granted the AKUMU mode achievement and the keeper DLC achievement for completing every torment are both really difficult, even if AKUMU is more so... Still, I completed AKUMU, but this keeper DLC's one challenge room is making me want to cry."
crashbandicoot,ff87hpy,t1_ff7yxlk,1579668201.0,"OK, I deleted my other two comments, I was basically talking way too much. <\_<;

Long story short, thanks to you sending me that video and me actually giving it another honest try to figure out the slide to jump to double jump combo, I got the gold relic with a time of 1:01:00 :-) I love you, man. Made a 5 min recording of gameplay on xbox, gotta gloat to my friends who could care less later. lol"
crashbandicoot,ff82lp9,t1_ff7yxlk,1579664342.0,"Does this mean that it's standard for anyone trying to get gold on every level to be able to do it without boots, or is this more of a ridiculous 0mg h@x type of thing? 

To be honest, it looks like he's jumping insanely high for no reason right off the bat which is discouraging for me, because it won't even let me double jump from a slide jump, I could time it at any part of the jumps and it doesn't do shit. That's pretty lame. :'-( Otherwise I feel like I'm doing it similarly. 

3 slide jumps to the steel box, only I wait for the carpet and can't just magically double jump from a slide jump like he seems to, definitely hurts me to have to wait a few seconds for the carpet. Although I'm not sure if there are enough parts like that to shave off like half a minute in my time. 

My best time so far has been 1:27 but I'm pretty sure I've been closer to like 1:10 to 1:15 on one attempt, I just fell short of that final jump with the guy on the magic carpet.. 

Still would've had to shave off 10 seconds which I'm guessing the boots will easily do but it's still frustrating since the game doesn't seem to cooperate with me.

I'm gonna just beat the game, get gold relics in most if not all of the other levels as I've been doing and just get the easy gold for that level after I get speed boots. I guarantee you I'll easily be in gold/plat territory since they're both like within several seconds of one another."

crashbandicoot,ff7lyqi,t1_ff7h7gn,1579652719.0,"So, how does one do that? I'm literally slide-jumping the entire level and basically making every jump and movement count and I pass the gold relic time by the time I'm approaching the third mask. Makes it seem like there's something I'm not doing right, but I'm not sure what else I could honestly be doing..

The videos on YouTube that I've seen are all with speed boots and even using the bazookas to get extra time so I can't find a single video that does it without them to actually get any ideas on what I can tweak in my attempts.. <_<

I've also found comments via search about how the HD trilogy requires the boots whereas the original didn't. I'm playing the trilogy. Not sure if that's actually true, but it sure feels like it. lol"

OP doesn't get the same level of attention she puts out because the person they're investing in is not that interested in them.

I figure since there have literally been multiple websites made just so that people can build lists of games that they have gotten all achievements in that it would make sense and probably wouldn't be a difficult feature to add in to the achievement system. 

So I can just show off that I got 200/200 in games like Super Meat Boy without people having to scroll through 40 games that I might've played for a little while but got like 30/1000 GS in that I may not even ever play again anyway.

theevilwithin,fedkmay,t3_eolfw3,1579013875.0,"My thoughts on what you've said, are that the story might seem less mysterious because in the first game, you're basically entering a situation completely in the dark as to what you've walked into before they hit us with another major story arc/antagonist/etc.

After having completed this game recently (I had only gotten to the puzzle part of chapter 9 a long time ago on Steam and for whatever reason never finished until I bought it for Xbone recently) I see the second game as basically tying up any loose ends/filling out and adding to what bits of information we learn in the first game.

In the first game, you're faced with a psychotic threat who is the core of the world you've been sucked into. So the world is darker, less rationally put together and even randomly falling apart or shifting to their will as they play with you like a sick child might ""play"" with a small caged pet.

In the second, the core is a pure/innocent and benevolent being, so the world was originally very stable and it's inhabitants all normal people conned into living in a fantasy land that might've worked well for awhile until a ""wild card"" variable got through the screening, another socio/psychopath. Since they had not yet become the core by the time you'd dealt with them, I'm guessing that's why the world hadn't gotten quite as fucked up as it could've been. They had a lot of control but seemingly not enough. You're also aware of the how/why/what of the situation this time having willingly entered this drastically more stable environment to rescue someone close to you. You are more mentally in control now than you were, so it's not really like Sebastian is walking on eggshells this time around. He's pissed and ready to wreck 'em.

Anyways, that's where the third game may be more like the first. RUVIK (real name Ruben) had walked away from Beacon in Leslie's body. I haven't played the first in awhile so my memory on all of the exact details are foggy but he was a nutcase who was willing to do horrendous things in the name of research or revenge.

If he creates a new STEM system and continues his work and research, things could definitely get interesting and I would imagine that he might not have a problem with being the ""core"" of a wireless system that he controls that could potentially span the globe. It doesn't matter if Sebastian saved his daughter and made it back to the real world, if a determined lunatic can literally turn the real world into a STEM environment for anyone within range of his wireless signals.

When that happens, it'll throw Sebastian totally off guard and mess with his head. Imagine having gone through all of that, thinking things are finally over... Then one day everything magically turns to shit and you're thinking that you're having a PTSD hallucination until you quickly figure out that it's really all happening and you don't know why.

I won't discuss anything story-wise or how any of the rest of the game's plot points change any existing information beyond Stefano the crazy camera hipster artist dirt bag since that's what you were up to as of posting this. lol.

Lastly, for what it's worth, my opinion is that the game isn't REALLY open world if you ask me, like you've said. A ""hybrid"" level design at best in the sense that... Were games like Super Mario 64 and Legend Of Zelda Ocarina Of Time open world because the level design was not quite as claustrophobic as Resident Evil for the Gamecube? They had larger more open levels but they were still self contained, far from something like Skyrim or The Witcher where you could walk in-game for like 20 minutes and not reach the other end of the map.

The Evil Within 2 is not nearly as open world as a typical modern open world game, the ""town"" levels that you navigate are simply much larger in scale. Was the original ""Silent Hill"" open world simply because you did navigate an entire town spanning many streets/blocks?"

Such bullshit. The video guides that claim that if you follow their general route/plan that it's pretty fail safe, is just bullshit. I don't think that much of the steps they took went according to plan for me, the AI is super alert and literally looking sideways at you no matter what direction they're walking. You die in two hits, not far from it basically being Akumu mode from the first game. And then on top of that, you have no stamina. The zombies actually will follow you across the god damn map, too.

NintendoSwitch,fda5l89,t1_fd9u8mp,1578241998.0,Yeah. I just realized I'm only like a quarter Italian through a DNA test. Makes sense given what I've figured out about my family. Feels-a bad-da man-a. :'-l(

theevilwithin,fd9qwhy,t1_fd8mtqj,1578236904.0,I know this is a dumb question but I'm asking anyway. Do you think that Ghostwire is them moving on from The Evil Within series? Or do you honestly think that they will eventually make a third installment? I obviously hope so... But I wonder why they didn't just focus on that.

NintendoSwitch,fd9mb8f,t1_fd8z4r9,1578235304.0,"Original? Oh, didn't catch that. Maybe. But if that's looking too much into the wording, then there is a chance it could be any of the Wii U titles. They certainly need to port those two at some point. 

It'd be nice to have every Zelda on the Switch and it's successor, assuming that the line will be backwards compatible."
NintendoSwitch,fd8uo1i,t1_fd3v7cw,1578223617.0,Paper Mario needs the Link's Awakening treatment. Redone in Thousand Year Door/Color Splash levels of graphical quality but remaining entirely true to the original game. I'd probably buy 10 copies of it just to support the series. lol.
NintendoSwitch,fd8uaax,t1_fd3zvhn,1578223445.0,Only if Pikmin 4 is gonna come out this year somehow. Otherwise I think SM3DW and Wind Waker/Twilight Princess are the best bets and the Pikmin trilogy or 3 will be released on switch around the time that Pikmin 4 is announced to be releasing soon.

I mean... Saying that the average player is ""sweaty"" but basically bragging about having the maturity and emotional control of a toddler. Normally I'd be all 'meh' but I feel like actually taking a few minutes out of my way to send an actual report to ms/xbox/dbd/etc if it actually got him in a bit of trouble for being a twat."

Keeping it simple is the way to go here. :-)"

It's literally people of every background doing it, too. It's really lame and I just mute them all. Relative anonymity brings out the worst in people weak of character."

dating,fcaj0bq,t1_fc8zlkd,1577570088.0,"I don't know. I feel like even if I put myself out there, I seem able to make women laugh and seem friendly and all that, but I don't think that means much. At the end of the day I often get the impression that nobody ever feels any interest towards me romantically, simply put. Sure I don't put myself around anyone, but I could go out to a bar every weekend and nothing would happen, I'd just fill up a bar seat. You'll often get posts by Redditors about how some girl/guy has been acting all interested and what not, or literally posts about how a guy or girl wants to be direct because they find the person cute or whatever.

I know that the isolation is the biggest issue but I can't figure out where to go. I think that my social skills are fine, or at least anyone who knows me would tell me that it isn't the issue, I need to be more <insert generic advice> etc.. 

I think that people in general are mostly all shallow, so I'm not exactly hating on women. I'm just often a bit pessimistic even if I generally act pretty chill and friendly. I don't have high expectations for my fellow man.

I shave my head, but have been told I have a perfectly shaped head for it so I can't complain. I'm thin and work out and am of around average height at 5'9. I guess none of that sounds particularly bad. I don't know if my facial features are goofy/unsettling.

I'd say that it's unlikely that I'm hideously ugly but who knows, maybe I'm a bit below average or something in that department. I'm pretty confident in most other aspects of my life at least. I do see unconventionally handsome or straight up 'ugly' guys with actually rather attractive women walking around in public places and it makes me think ""why couldn't that be me?"" but also ""well, I must be uglier than those guys"".. No offense to them anyway. Just for the sake of the conversation. lol."

dating,fc85oxu,t1_fc6zhf1,1577527437.0,"""You make too many aggressive jokes"" in my mind is not nearly as offensive/absolutely dismissive/potentially hurtful as ""you are simply ugly""... I can deal with any kind of criticism, but most criticism would be much easier to take than some kind of irredeemable quality that this person truly believes that I possess. 

I would think about what you said and if it really is a bad/potentially harmful habit I'd try to squash it and better myself. I suppose most people male and female wouldn't do that unless they naturally decided to, so I don't blame you for being hesitant to be honest but it does help to leave them in the dark. Not that it's your obligation to try and help ""fix"" someone who's broken in some way, be it a minor or major way."
