I’m 51, raised religious with conservative Boomer parents who are, indeed, swooning over this. 

As for me, my husband, and my peers, not so much.  Most of the middle-aged people I know well enough to suss out their religious beliefs are not going to be in favor of this political charade.

Ageism and graceless, sweeping generalizations aren’t anywhere near as rotten as religious bigotry, but it still stings just a tad bit.

Yeah, about that ...

The bloodshed, rape, theft, oppression, human trafficking, war, corruption, misery, and torture that can be laid directly at the feet of Mother Church is truly *staggering*.  That’s not hyperbole; if anything, it’s probably the mildest way to put it. And I’m not even talking about any fringe elements or extremists, either.  These people are either ignorant of or simply refuse to acknowledge the history of their own kind.

Also, most Christians don’t even know that separation of church and state was codified in order to protect Christian denominations **from each other**, and not to protect Christians from other religions or atheism!"

Also, fear of the dentist and shame are powerful de-motivators.

Being stupid isn’t really part of the equation for most people who have bad teeth.  They’re too poor to get their teeth fixed, they’re ashamed, they’re afraid, and some of them have bad teeth due to addiction or depression.

The filmmaker will *sometimes* allow her to have slightly tousled hair after she’s been lost in the woods for a week with no supplies, but that’s usually about it. Her clothes will get dirty and strategically torn, and she may get sweaty, but at least she managed to find a comb, shaving cream, and a razor out there in the wildnerness!

Even nowadays, since filmmakers decided that every peasant or poor person simply must be covered with visible dirt, the young women in leading roles are still relatively clean and rather artfully smudged ... while still having magically hairless legs and armpits!"
