dogs,ff94vm0,t3_es6djx,1579704896.0,"Sorry for your situation. Heart murmurs may or may not be present in cases of DCM (whether nutritional or genetic). However, your dog is a CKC, so there is a trend of cardiac disease in his breed. 

Were his sire and dam screened for cardiac disease with an echocardiogram prior to breeding? If his lineage is clear of problems, it may be more suggestive of nutritional.

It will be impossible to tell which is the cause unless you switch diets as instructed and see resolution. However, if you don’t see resolution, that doesn’t influence either way.

And there are many more conditions associated with murmurs than just DCM. You absolutely can’t know until you have an echo done.

For what it's worth, there are no issues that are 'beneath' a behaviorist if you feel it is warranted - they see a range of patients for inappropriate elimination to extreme aggression. All behaviorists I know will come up with a treatment plan (meds if indicated, plus behavior modification / desensitization) for you to work on at home after your appointment. You update regularly and do a recheck at set intervals. If you need more help or prefer more structured work with a trainer, they'll usually be able to recommend one. So maybe hang on to the IAABC person and ask the behaviorist if they'd be a good match to continue working on things.


Sorry to hear about your experiences; those were one motivator for me to enter the field. And every negative experience will at best result in no change to the emotion or at worst heighten it. So it really snowballs once the pet is afraid and you force them. It also becomes more dangerous for both people and animal. Sedation/anxiolytics are cheap and effective, so why not use them?

Dobermans are a good example of this - a lot of older practitioners will maintain that they were almost universally vicious until around the mid-1990s, at which point the breed club as a whole began breeding for a more sociable temperament. Dobermans are still relatively rare today, but I meet some friendly ones now.

Some breeds are dying out, receiving unfair criticism, or rehomed/surrendered at alarming rates because they are a poor match for people wanting pets.

Anyway, I wanted to ask about Baron and your cat. Does the cat have plenty of vertical space? You can look at something like the Indoor Pet Initiative at Ohio State CVM for ideas, but basically you give them enough escape routes and resting places that they can easily be out of ~~harm’s~~ dog’s way. I’m sure you know this, but you can also work on redirection or incompatible behaviors. 

Or if it’s that bad, maybe something like a Jafco or Baskerville muzzle when unsupervised?"

dogs,fe5xbrc,t1_fe4k9og,1578877031.0,Here’s another warning to stop giving bad advice and trolling this subreddit. You’ll be banned if you continue.
dogs,fe5wwqv,t3_enw428,1578876768.0,"I don’t know of any regulars here who would condone such behavior and I’m not sure why this post was made since it seems not to be in good faith. We are staunchly opposed to animal cruelty and neglect, and many of us advocate for exclusively positive-reinforcement + negative-punishment based training.

I am locking this thread but leaving it up so that it can be clear to future visitors that this subreddit does not condone anything that would unnecessarily jeopardize the well-being of an animal."
dogs,fe5wj60,t1_fe5v64i,1578876528.0,[This post](https://reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/enp9ke/help_please_help_im_going_insane_rescue_dog/) is probably the one OP is referring to.
dogs,fe5wa21,t3_enp9ke,1578876369.0,"I want to emphasize that it is extremely risky to muzzle a dog for more than 30 minutes. They cannot pant, which means they cannot shed heat effectively, nor can they eat or drink. All of these things can be extremely distressing to a dog, and the more distressed they get, the more it compounds the issues.

If you cannot handle the barking and can’t find a way to occupy him overnight (eg food toys, etc), then you need to contact the rescue to return/rehome him or seek the help of a positive-reinforcement based trainer or board-certified veterinary behaviorist (DACVB). 

Muzzling a dog for long periods of time may be in violation of animal cruelty laws."
