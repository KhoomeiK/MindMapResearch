Psychonaut,ffsgjnb,t1_ffs0cpn,1580181175.0,">Heritable epigenetic changes due to environmental exposures.

Funny you should say that, Because that's actually one of the main reasons I don't fully believe in evolution. Environmental pressures never cause adaptive genetic mutations, And non genetic adaptions are never inherited. As I said, Our existence is quite a mystery that none of us really fully understands even if some claim to.

I mentioned evolution because I think most people don't disagree with it, And wanted to explain that not even evolutionists claim that any acquired trait -*as a result of environment or, Like our topic, Mind altering drugs*\- is inherited by offspring. The only role environment plays is natural selection. They claim that random gamete mutations which happen as a result of UV light, Radiation, etc, Which if resulted in a positive trait, Would become prevalent among species over generations.

Realistically this is extremely unlikely -*random mutations causing positive traits, That is*\-, That it's virtually impossible. There's plenty more to the subject but that's not really related to what we're discussing.

>your hardline stance on ""no genetic changes absent gamete mutation"" 

That's actually not my stance. That's scientific fact. Plain and simple. No room for personal opinions. If your skin gets darker because you spend most of your time under the sun, Your children won't inherit this trait, Since your darker skin is a result of increased melanin pigmentation, And not a natural trait expressed by proteins copied from your DNA.

>It leads you to take a stronger posture on several aspects of this matter than even some professionals in the fields we're touching on as amateurs

Sure, Neither of us has a PhD in any of those fields, But that doesn't mean you can't think critically and objectively if you're well informed.

I explained how genetic mutations never happen as a result of environmental exposure, And that's not a contradiction in my logic, That's a deficit in what we really know about life. Let me know if there's anything else I said that you think is inaccurate.

>Does this reveal a personal position you feel important to defend

I'm not sure what that means, Or what I said that you might be referring to, Or why is this even relevant.

If you mean I sound like a hard-core nihilist, I'm not that. If you mean I sound strictly religious, I'm also not that.

As of more things existing beyond our material universe, I'd be arrogant to say there isn't. I still believe in the necessity of there being a creator. Entities on psychedelics? While I respect those who believe those exist within or beyond our material world, Believing so would be quite naive and irrational imho.

Your brain has infinite power over your consciousness. Altering that means altering the system of your existence. Anything you experience once it's altered is immediately discredited.

Here's another thing: Claiming entities and spirits exist is an unfalsifiable claim, But it would still be irrational to believe since it's also unverifiable. However, The hypothesis that using a mind altering substance could affect your offspring is a flasifiable claim, Because we know for a fact that nothing that doesn't affect the DNA in the cells of your reproductive system is inheritable.

Psychonaut,ffrnjfg,t1_ffrcz37,1580161736.0,">there on the edge between ""nothing can change the brain's capabilities"" and ""the brain's capabilities change"". What, I wonder?

Well it's most definitely not a drug some ancestor found that taught them to see color, Or any other neurological function, If that's what you're implying.

This kind of change never happens in an individual in their life time, Not one reliable case of an individual ever gaining a new neurological ability was recorded throughout human history, And, Hypothetically, If one were to gain any such ability, That individual would not pass it to their offspring.

I don't know what your world view is, Even though I only partially agree with the theory, I think evolution is a concept most people can comprehend.

The only way such thing can realistically happen, A genetic mutation must happen to the parent's sperm or oval, Which end up forming an individual, That will spread that mutation if it caused a positive change through natural selection.

In no way an acquired trait is passed to the offspring. This is so common knowledge, Your point sounds so strange. It reminds me of the quite naive ""stoned ape 'theory'"".

>You speak of the brain as so static a thing

In a way, Yes, A singular person's brain is, In one definition of the word, Static. Individual brains don't change in that way, They do so over generations.

However, I wouldn't call it static, As the word suggest limitations. The brain is incredibly powerful, Much more than most people realize.

Also important to note: The brain =/= The mind. The brain is the fleshy organ that simulates the mind, Based on it's own genetic material. The mind can want, Hate, Enjoy, Or suffer. The brain doesn't care, It's physiology will stay the same and it will keep working according to instructions, Enabling the experiences of pleasure or suffering, Even if that means the mind experiences hell.

The reason I'm saying this is, One might think their brain's capabilities are what one naturally experiences, Psychedelics show you a novel state of consciousness, Therefore psychedelics bring something new to the brain. No. Your brain's existence is above yours, And there's so much more going on behind the curtain to properly work your consciousness. To tamper with your brain is literally to tamper with the system of your existence.

>Something is happening, What, I wonder?

Don't we all? Our existence and condition are a huge riddle full of mysteries. We don't really have an answer, But suggesting that foreign substances had anything to do with it, Or that this something happens in an individual's life time then passed to offspring, Is directly against science and observation.

You need the substance to change your thoughts because, Your brain won't spontaneously change it's chemical equilibrium, Disregarding your genetic material.

Therefore you need the external substance to tamper with your brain chemistry.

>it needed a foreign substance to reign mayhem on it

Yeah exactly, That is true, ""mayhem"" being the over-stimulation of your brain's serotonergic system, Causing you to experience a trip.

The thing is, Your neurons are already programmed to react a certain way when it's serotonin -or any other- receptors fire.

However, The whole point I'm trying to get at is, Psych molecules themselves do not carry any information, Each psych just causes some of the 5-HT receptors to fire because of their structure, Each psych with it's own unique affinity to each receptor it affects, And that's why psychedelics are different from one another.

But the molecule itself doesn't carry any foreign information to the cell, The molecule just activates receptors just like their natural transmitters would, Just in different strengths -binding affinities- from theirs, Producing varying subjective experiences, And overstimulating particular systems of the brain, Serotonergic system with psychs, Dopamine, Norepinephrine and serotonin systems with meth, etc.

Everything we experience on drugs we already know our brains are capable of experiencing. However, Something new to our human experience means a kind of novel neural signal.

Here are some examples which may sound odd at first: No drug gives you the ability to visualize a color outside of the colors human brains can see. This isn't impossible because other species can. No drug can make you experience a dimension other than the 3 we can perceive, Or give you the ability to imagine a ""new"" sense like seeing, Hearing or tasting. Your auditory and visual hallucinations are all made up of things you have seen sometime before in your life, Not brought to our brains as information in the form of a molecule.

So it was smart of you to start with 200 mgs, Which even at this dose things can get crazy, Definitely smarter than those who do a 3rd plat on their first time and end up majorly fucked haha.

Anyways, Have a fun trip."
dxm,ffdrx15,t3_et1zth,1579827423.0,"Hey man. Relax, You will be fine I promise. It is a strong experience and DXM is pretty stimulating in low doses. I wouldn't be concerned unless you're experiencing adverse physical issues, It sounds to me like what you're experiencing is just because of the mental instability DXM causes, As well as nausea from the syrup.

Sit down, Meditate if you meditate, And/or play some music you like. Don't fight it and let it take you where it wants."

researchchemicals,ffdp75v,t3_et240a,1579825684.0,Uhm free samples? idk they normally just want you to send them some cryptocurrency. No idea why anyone would ask for your address. No chance it's a cop either. Maybe they'll use it to blackmail you? idk.

Interestingly, He says the FLDS did that because they often use dead cats as threatening messages to former members, Being one himself."

DMT,ffbt7om,t3_esggrw,1579781874.0,"Fascinating how it seems that geometry stimulates our biological, Chemical brains and is understood by them, Which is apparent when you look at geometrical patterns like these and find them in ancient buildings in different parts of the world, And when you see how our brains create geometry on psychedelics.

It feels like it's deliberately put there in the core of our selves."
SuicideWatch,ffbk26n,t3_esog4z,1579769026.0,"I assure you, You certainly won't die from 8 grams, But that's just enough to cause poisoning. Two days later you might be in horrible, Unbearable pain. And you'll be like that for a whole week.

While 8 grams might not even be enough to poison some people, You should go to the poison control center and receive nac -N-Acetylcysteine- infusion immediately. It won't be effective after 8-12 hours from ingestion so please, Please go ASAP. I'm not saying this to prevent you from suicide, I just want to save you unnecessary pain.

The reason acetaminophen poisoning is dangerous isn't directly because of liver failure, But because it can cause complications like kidney failure, Blood clotting, And others. If you visit the hospital only when you start noticing the effects, There's nothing they can do other than monitor your vital signals. And you will NOT die even if you didn't go to the hospital. Please go ASAP."
Psychonaut,ff9medh,t3_es63m2,1579716039.0,The room and the music. Perfection.
Psychonaut,ff9aph8,t1_ff8o61i,1579708680.0,"Customs won't even know there are tabs inside. It's -almost always- a regular letter envelope and the tabs are just paper. It doesn't say it contains RCs on the outside, No vendor does that. And if they were to find the tabs, They would seize the shipment, Possibly send you a letter telling you it was intercepted to scare you from doing it again.

They almost never press charges. Even if the drugs inside are illegal -*Which you can also order online, But didn't want to suggest something illegal not to mention it's a lot more work and higher risk of getting scammed*\-.

Here's why: They can't punish you because someone sent drugs to your address with your name on it, And it's going to be way harder to convict you for buying RCs and not illegal drugs, And it's not even worth wasting resources to bust end users, They're more interested in busting suppliers and dealers higher up in the chain.

With all that said, It's different from one country to the other. They will open a package they suspect regardless of the law in some places and people have been arrested for ordering. Do your own research and decide yourself if it's safe to order to your country."
