Depression and suicidal thoughts are very common  among people and it is very serious. Even if you get offended by everything, you should at least try to help anyone feeling like this.OP is not heartless as they keep accusing other people of being heartless. If you bring down other people for doing something while you are guilty of it yourself, you truly are the lowest scum in history. Anyway, obviously OP didn't even try to help this person crying out for help. If someone says they are suicidal, take them seriously for they might not be joking. I myself have been brought to the brink of death but i survived. If you are feeling depressed or suicidal, i suggest find someone to talk to about it. There are people that care. Don't be afraid to talk about it. That's all"
