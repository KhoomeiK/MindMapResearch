Get an oven thermometer.  No, not from the dollar store.  Spend $30 or so at a good kitchen stuff store.  Better yet, find it at a restaurant supplier.

whatisthisthing,fcmsyz0,t1_fcm6kng,1577790759.0,"My primary job is in building supplies.  We'd need to be caring for and keeping track of six or more cats at our lumberyard/warehouse.  We would then also need a better fence encircling the property to keep said cats where they need to be, at quite a cost to build and maintain.  We'd have to do where people are constantly driving through and opening and closing doors and gates.  Not to mention the transport trucks, forklifts, and cranes.

Not to mention, we have endangered birds and small mammals in the area.  Cats would attack them indiscriminately and have been partly to blame for the population decline of the birds in question.

If we use rat poison, we can control whether or not it is accessible by birds and roaming pets.  We use bait boxes and traps because they work and don't cost us time, feed, fencing, and vetenary care.  We are surrounded by farmland, so pest control is absolutely necessary.   Our neighbors use the same methods for similar reasons, though they all do have at least a few cats.

At home, a cat in a fenced yard is nice to help, sure.  It would be irreponsible for our wildlife to just release one into the neighborhood.   That said, that is only doable if you aren't allergic."
iamveryrandom,fcljy31,t1_fclgyce,1577749540.0,"r/beermoney is actually a good place to start.  Try to read the comments.  You can evaluate whether a site is legit by seeing if anyone is complaining about not getting paid.  These are generally very low yield, but also very easy to get started with.

Pinecone Research is my favorite.  They are by invite only, as are most of the higher paying groups.  The way you get an invite is by participating in other programs.  I got in via P&G's SampleSource.  Just pay attention the emails they send you and do any surveys they ask.  The may eventually ask you to do a long-form survey...which in my case was my first Pinecone survey.  You might also get an in by following various brands on email or twitter.  PepsiCo brands, Mondelez, Quaker, and Molson all use the service in Canada.  

Basically, just have profiles/accounts with various stores and watch your mail/email to eventually get survey invites."

iamveryrandom,fck62oz,t1_fck3efk,1577717624.0,"The answer was probably in the instructions at the start of the survey.  Something like: ""Question 21is an an evaluation question.   Please answer 3.  Do not answer differently or you may not receive points for this survey.""

I did lots of these things over the years.   The more legit companies almost always use this tactic.  Even the pen and paper ones from years ago.  The wrong answer gets the results of your survey rejected.  Too many rejected surveys gets your account restricted from receiving any more surveys.

They indeed do it to make sure you are paying attention and answering as honestly as far as they can tell.  

They also watch for things like answering all 5's or 1's.  They repeat questions with slightly different wording to see if you answer they same.  They ask for written comments sometimes just to see if you are actually reading the questions.  They ask unrelated questions about innocuous subjects that people have strong opinions on like ""How much do you enjoy pineapple on pizza?"", where they don't care about the answer as much as whether or not you actually have an opinion.  They'll throw in a repeat question where the positive and negative answers are reversed, to make sure you are reading carefully.

It's actually a fascinating field.  Incentivised surveying gets lots of information.  I've had surveys that have been so long they had taken a few days to complete.  They have the risk of people gaming the system or just being lazy... those responses are worthless because they aren't genuine opinions.  That's why they have all these tactics.  It saves them money."

I was the one who had to take a young black coworker into an HR meeting to discuss the implications of some discriminatory language he used against another employee.

For pot, I really enjoy a Zippo, and it's not hard to find one (or a servicable knock-off) or the fluid in most countries.  The major con is you have to refill it constantly.  I keep it, and the fuel, with my stash.

For anything else at all, a butane lighter is much more practical.  I buy cheap plastic jet lighters at a dollar store, and keep one in every bag or jacket I own.  They have a super-hot pinpoint flame that you can even use to melt a bit of solder in a pinch.   They run for a long time on the fuel they come with, but I haven't seen an off-brand lighter in Canada that didn't have a refill port."

whatisthisthing,fcmsyz0,t1_fcm6kng,1577790759.0,"My primary job is in building supplies.  We'd need to be caring for and keeping track of six or more cats at our lumberyard/warehouse.  We would then also need a better fence encircling the property to keep said cats where they need to be, at quite a cost to build and maintain.  We'd have to do where people are constantly driving through and opening and closing doors and gates.  Not to mention the transport trucks, forklifts, and cranes.

Not to mention, we have endangered birds and small mammals in the area.  Cats would attack them indiscriminately and have been partly to blame for the population decline of the birds in question.

If we use rat poison, we can control whether or not it is accessible by birds and roaming pets.  We use bait boxes and traps because they work and don't cost us time, feed, fencing, and vetenary care.  We are surrounded by farmland, so pest control is absolutely necessary.   Our neighbors use the same methods for similar reasons, though they all do have at least a few cats.

At home, a cat in a fenced yard is nice to help, sure.  It would be irreponsible for our wildlife to just release one into the neighborhood.   That said, that is only doable if you aren't allergic."
iamveryrandom,fcljy31,t1_fclgyce,1577749540.0,"r/beermoney is actually a good place to start.  Try to read the comments.  You can evaluate whether a site is legit by seeing if anyone is complaining about not getting paid.  These are generally very low yield, but also very easy to get started with.

Pinecone Research is my favorite.  They are by invite only, as are most of the higher paying groups.  The way you get an invite is by participating in other programs.  I got in via P&G's SampleSource.  Just pay attention the emails they send you and do any surveys they ask.  The may eventually ask you to do a long-form survey...which in my case was my first Pinecone survey.  You might also get an in by following various brands on email or twitter.  PepsiCo brands, Mondelez, Quaker, and Molson all use the service in Canada.  

Basically, just have profiles/accounts with various stores and watch your mail/email to eventually get survey invites."

Seriously though, we go through this stuff like gangbusters in rural Canada.  Sometimes you really need to do something about them."
iamveryrandom,fck62oz,t1_fck3efk,1577717624.0,"The answer was probably in the instructions at the start of the survey.  Something like: ""Question 21is an an evaluation question.   Please answer 3.  Do not answer differently or you may not receive points for this survey.""

I did lots of these things over the years.   The more legit companies almost always use this tactic.  Even the pen and paper ones from years ago.  The wrong answer gets the results of your survey rejected.  Too many rejected surveys gets your account restricted from receiving any more surveys.

They indeed do it to make sure you are paying attention and answering as honestly as far as they can tell.  

They also watch for things like answering all 5's or 1's.  They repeat questions with slightly different wording to see if you answer they same.  They ask for written comments sometimes just to see if you are actually reading the questions.  They ask unrelated questions about innocuous subjects that people have strong opinions on like ""How much do you enjoy pineapple on pizza?"", where they don't care about the answer as much as whether or not you actually have an opinion.  They'll throw in a repeat question where the positive and negative answers are reversed, to make sure you are reading carefully.

It's actually a fascinating field.  Incentivised surveying gets lots of information.  I've had surveys that have been so long they had taken a few days to complete.  They have the risk of people gaming the system or just being lazy... those responses are worthless because they aren't genuine opinions.  That's why they have all these tactics.  It saves them money."
