todayilearned,ffsvs2w,t1_ffsrlcy,1580194442.0,"Increases in productivity are more or less entirely driven by technological advancement. Without the negotiating power of unions  the individual does not have the ability to barter with the capital class for their fair share of general technological advancements. IE a tech explosion will greatly increase productivity in all sectors, and a non-unionized labor supply in other sectors will produce *much* more, but employers won't be incentivized to pay them another cent: they buy computers, expect the employee to self-train, then pay them the same wage they always made.

Edit: it's worth mentioning that this generally results in, for example, technology improving productivity by 100%, and without a strong union for the sector employers will choose to fire half their workforce and half the employees make the same product for half the total sector compensation, instead of cutting all hours by 50% and keeping total compensation for all the workers same. Those fired workers leave with less than nothing. In fact all they do is inflate the total labor supply hurting *all* sectors. Decades ago economists were predicting we would be on an 8 hour work week by now, instead people are working more than ever for less hourly pay, while the very top of the pyramid got an *absurd* raise. Instead we got this mess called neoliberalism."
