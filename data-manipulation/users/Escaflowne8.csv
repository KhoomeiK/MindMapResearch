stopdrinking,ffkjixc,t3_etxykg,1580023807.0,"I feel that. Sometimes its a hard pill to sallow while reading all the 'I love my sober life' posts. I have a pretty crippling MH disorder, and it's been incredibly detrimental whether I'm sober or not. But that was excellent phrasing, at least sober I do have a chance to defeat my demons.

Best of luck to us all :)"
schizophrenia,ffjik1f,t3_ety7iq,1579999006.0,"Strong agree. Although the key is knowing that almost everyone feels that way, we just have different degrees of being able to BS our way through life lol"

schizophrenia,ff8tawk,t3_es8t6e,1579695290.0,"I imagine you'll find it common in this group of Mental Illness, I certainly go through simular issues. I mean, its common with normal people to an extent, I think think whatever screwed neurotransmitter balance in SZ is exacerbates the tendency to get fixated on things like that.  The good news is you can practice coping strats, and it can get easier. Good luck my friend"

schizoaffective,ff7wiyd,t3_er7r09,1579660038.0,"yeah I go through something pretty similar, very awhile articulated. I get into moods where literally everything interpret with malicious intent, and my delusions get hard to manage. It can be pretty paralyzing. I think as time goes on I've learned to manage it better. You can learn way to fight it, and your mental fortitude will naturally get stronger with time. Best of luck figure positive ways to deal with it :)"

KindVoice,femsfbu,t3_epyy10,1579268288.0,"I feel that man. I think about relapse quite often at times. But we know its just never worth it. Sure it gets really tempting, but it'll just leave us worse off when we quit again. Best of luck getting things balanced out. Hope things get better my friend. Prayers your way"
SuicideWatch,femrqol,t3_epvxmj,1579267717.0,"I'm so sorry for everything you've had to go through. Please understand that all that bullying didn't have that much to do with you. Some people's only recluse from their own struggles is criticize someone else. When we're kids (and sometimes adults too), its easier to look down on someone else rather than face your own insecurity. I'm afraid you became somewhat of a lightning rod for other people when you were at school. Most people didn't bully you because they actually thought you were worthless or ugly, it was just easier to do that than have the courage to work through their own issues. Even all the terrible things your ex said about you was probably just an attempt to deflect the guilt and shame he felt about what he did to you :( Cognitive dissonance is a powerful thing. People will go to great lengths to avoid feeling bad about what they know is wrong. So, please don't be to hard on yourself. I think you must have been incredibly strong person to have gone through so much and still be a good person.

I guess my point is you should be proud of yourself. You took on the doubts and insecurities of so many people and your still here. Your soul is still beautiful. I believe with all my heart your reward will be precious and clean. Chin up girl, there is a whole wonderful world and amazing experiences waiting for you. Now I can't prove it yet, but I'm sure it'll all be worth it :) Stay strong"

bipolar,fe0gkuk,t3_encbw8,1578813106.0,"It bothers me. For people I care about, I'll eventually try to find a tactful way to explain the differences on things like clinical depression vs being depressed, being anxious vs crippling anxiety etc, and talk about where the line is drawn, and how impact symptoms like psychosis and mania can be. I try to get a gentle tone, and let it be a learning experience. In the end I can't blame most people, there's simply a lot of mental health issues you can grasp unless you been close to it or have it."

cripplingalcoholism,fdjz877,t3_eljx14,1578492006.0,"I think your heart knows what you need to do. Don't complicate things, something in your heart knows what you need to chase, and its not alcohol. Free yourself, chase things above and beyond your vision. Don't believe in the covenant lies your weaker self will tell you. Dear God, I love the better person in you right now, the person that wanted to break free while you wrote this. Don't let yourself drown that person out. You don't have to do it all right now, but start making the steps you know you need to make. At the end of everything, start being the person you want to be."
UnsentLetters,fdf17gh,t3_ekp9o1,1578350996.0,"As someone with schizoaffective and that has two older siblings, this really warms my heart :) What a wonderful soul you have. In my case, we are all in our 30's, and I think everything has worked out okay enough so far. I've tried with meds and without, and both are challenging, but manageable. So there is plenty of reason to hope (I've seen temleOS too).  I worry that they spend too much time concerned about my future, but I guess that's just the human thing to do. 

Having people that he can trust will be very important, and with it your heart it seems like he will have that :) Don't be afraid to let him learn some normal life lessons the hard way, you can't protect him from everything. But also when he's filled with panic, there's not much you can do but be patient, kind, gentle and warm. It's wonderful that he has someone like you to fight with him. I'll be saying a prayer for you and your family, much love, hope and peace your way!"

I haven't found anything that quite lived up to HK's magic, but The Messenger, Iconoclasts, and especially Celeste were all unique and enjoyable. Runner up recommendations would be Dead cells,  Momodora Reverie Under Moonlight, and Dark Souls"

Whether it goes well or not, you'll get to experience a new culture, and grow as a person :) I think it really cool that you were brave enough to do it (even if it was while manic). Look at it as a chance to learn and grow, and count your blessings that your wife is cool enough to go on this journey with you. Just give it I'm honestly kind of inspired, its something you both wanted to do and you made it happen. Be proud of yourself for that. Praying that the very best comes from it!

On a personal note, can I ask if your getting therapy or med management? I'd love to be in a place to do something similar, but at times I feel like its to unlikely with how fearful I am. What do you feel has contributed towards your success?"
