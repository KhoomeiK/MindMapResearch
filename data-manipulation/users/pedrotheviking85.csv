It isn't generally illegal to manipulate people into giving you money so I don't see legal recourse but I'm not a lawyer. If you want to hire anyone I guess it'd be a lawyer."
baseball,ff8zo78,t1_ff7vnki,1579701066.0,"I don't think that's it. The thing is you need to adjust for the era and a lot of people don't do that, while his stats don't look great for a pitcher say in the 70s and 80s they were great in the area in which he pitched. That's why his war is a no doubt Hof war. Adjusting for the era is one of the most useful things war does."

nfl,fe42fh4,t1_fe415lg,1578855085.0,"This is the same thing that had already happened this year against the Bears and Packers, drive after drive after drive with a total inability to move the ball. It wasn't even turnovers or anything it was 3 and out mostly."
nfl,fe3v5ya,t1_fe3gsks,1578853175.0,"It seems incredibly clear that a defensive coordinator with a strong game plan can make this offense almost totally unable to move the ball. We had  multiple big games this year where we had under 200 yards total offense. He was totally outcoached yesterday, yeah the 49ers are little better but it shouldn't have looked like that."
nfl,fe3u9mu,t1_fe3jldg,1578852944.0,"Vikings fans are literally excited that he's gone, that should be concerning. What do I know maybe it'll work out but I've watched every game that he's called and I do not consider him some kind of special offensive mind. What he does can look great against bad teams, and has been  torn to shreds when the other team has a plan. Yikes."
nfl,fe3t412,t1_fe3fxk8,1578852649.0,Our offensive play-calling against good defenses was consistently bad. The Bears and Packers had already made us look exactly how we looked yesterday.

nfl,fdj4txc,t3_eljeuf,1578458474.0,This thread is going to be a lot of jokes but honestly I think as much as any player ever Lamar Jackson fails or at least isn't this good for a team that doesn't know how to use him.

privinv,fdgtkm6,t1_fcvnp2z,1578407975.0,I'll just say this is better on a case-by-case basis as opposed to a blanket rule. Maybe this is because I'm in Louisiana where fraud is prevalent and people are suspicious. At every agency I ever worked at that had this policy cases occasionally to regularly got burned to the ground from the very beginning because we had to do this. If you don't have a phone number and you have to knock on the door in some trailer park in Cajun country the case has a high chance of failure from that point.
AskReddit,fdgpt6u,t1_fdgoio1,1578405119.0,"You're just saying nonsense, California does not have the highest taxes in the world. And overall you totally ignored everything that I said, if all of the most successful countries on Earth practice these policies then what is your fundamental basis for saying that they don't work? There is no developed country with regulations as low as Republicans want thing, there is no developed country with taxes as low as Republicans want them, there is no developed country without a minimum wage. To the extent any of these countries practice Republican policies like Japan with incredibly low immigration you can see a strong downside. Japan's population is aging and shrinking at a disturbing rate. Seriously answer me please if none of these policies work then why do all of the most successful countries on Earth practice them? That doesn't make any sense."

AskReddit,fdgo3i0,t1_fdgnjpd,1578403690.0,"It's really hard to take you seriously when you make a statement like ""current liberal policies don't work"" when the majority of those policies are practiced by almost every first world country. Economics for example is not the same as physics, you can't demonstrably prove that something works in a laboratory. You can create some kind of theoretical framework to test these type of ideas or you can see what happens when you put a policy into action. Most of the most successful countries follow most of the Democratic party's current policies. That is a fact."

nfl,fdd3ql6,t1_fdco12z,1578293538.0,"I'm a Vikings fan, I totally believe we can beat the Packers but in a power ranking they have to be above us. We're 0-2 this year against them. Let's be honest over time the Vikings usually win at home and usually lose in Lambeau."

CFB,fcv8wju,t1_fcv315n,1577997087.0,"Every major school has a region where they should have an advantage in recruiting, USC getting beat in recruiting in their literal hometown is bad.
