But over the past few years, the product has dropped off for me, and there's about six other services that I watch significantly more - and, as shitty as it sounds, I can stream the PPV's from other sites without worrying about it - and since I don't really watch RAW/SD anymore, I don't feel like I'm really ""stealing"" from them."

Pensacola,fgqqhpj,t3_ezxsmh,1581029342.0,"I just moved to Pensacola - 35/m.

I'm up on the North side and while I like it - it's quiet, peaceful, etc.. - I feel kind of isolated. 

I'm looking to move towards the city, & the Southtowne apartments look super attractive to me. I'm also looking at Pensacola Beach, since it's not too far from downtown but also it's own little spot. 

Navarre looks really cool - I'm in a band and we play there all the time. But it's definitely a small community & outside of the beach, there's just not a lot to do there. 

If you have any questions, feel free to DM me!"

fightporn,fgf0vm7,t1_fgdm4du,1580718439.0,"When I was a substitute teacher, which I planned on doing until I got certified to take a full time teaching job, we had a VERY serious presentation about how no much you wanted to, if students got physical, you were NOT to touch them. You were to send a student to get an administrator to handle it, & if it turned into a fight, you let it play out until it was over. 

It was unreal."
