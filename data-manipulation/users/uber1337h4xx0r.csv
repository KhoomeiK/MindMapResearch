If you need sustained bombing by carrying a ton (figurative, not literally) of bombs, a b52 will do the job far more decently than a smaller multirole (at the cost of being slow and shitty at air fighting). 

And then there are specialty bombers that can carry nukes that wouldn't work on a multirole.

As for begging the question, it's essentially circular reasoning where you're forced to ask someone ""and explain why you think that's true, then"". 

A common example of someone begging the question is, ""well, god is real, the Bible says so!""

Being like ""well, do you support forcing someone to marry their rapist"" isn't begging the question.  It's just ""asking a follow up question""."
