I will acknowledge my angry or sadness, and then observe how I habitually want to react to it, what thoughts arise as a consequence, what happens next, I just observe, just like in meditation. I may think, I hate this, and I observe it. By observing you don't continue  fueling the train of thought, and it eventually ends."

Buddhism,fcm1ajs,t1_fbteoqo,1577761630.0,"Hello, I am so sorry to reply so late and thank you for your question.

The Monastery is predominantly Chinese so everything is taught and communicated in Chinese. However, like many others within the community, I was a foreigner and couldn't speak a word of Chinese before arriving there. However, they have many programs that helped us learn the language as fast as possible, including a year or two of Chinese classes, which is actually mandatory before we can begin learning the sutras. Within the two years I was there, I learnt to converse quite comfortably and can read and write too. The environment there is very peaceful, energetic and focused so it makes learning anything much more efficient and effective. That was a major factor to how I was able to learn so fast.

It lasts for as long as you want to stay there. Many people remain monks until their final breaths, but some also just join for a 4 month experience. At the Buddhist College, the course is 3 years and after that you can remain within the monastic community either as a layperson or a Monk. They are very accepting of everyone.

And it is possible to attain a bachelor's degree in the Buddhist College if you are willing to spend more time on the academic criteria.

I hope this answers some of your questions =)"

Meditation,fblvek8,t1_fbkafzr,1576971296.0,"Meditation was not the main focus at my monastery, as we cultivated our practice throughout the day doing everything. That being said we'd still meditate 30-60 mins a day. More during the breaks,and may even enter into meditation retreat for a week or so."
