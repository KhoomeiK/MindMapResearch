depression,ffg15vl,t3_etdypp,1579896215.0,"Therapy never really helped me either. I am horrendously lonely and for me, paying someone for an hour of their time didn't really help with anything. Rather spend that £60 on a massage."
depression,ffg0xjs,t3_et7uas,1579896073.0,"My next birthday I will be 35. I've got a good job and my own place. Masters degree under my belt.

And my life is pointless. Every weekend, I spend alone apart from going to see my parents or go to the gym. I don't care about starting new hobbies because really, what is the point? Life is just a dark tunnel."
depression,ffg0lp3,t1_fffzkj4,1579895873.0,Same! Both days I feel a huge lump in my throat. I just want them over with when they come around.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fff50k8,t1_fff2xr2,1579875861.0,"Thank you! By shaming people, it's making them think they can't go to their doctor/confide in others if they are symptomatic or asymptomatic. Especially for women, they need to be aware that they need to do to have regular pap/smear tests. If you shame them, they're less likely to get checked and treated.

And cervical dysplasia caused by HPV is NOT CANCER. Dysplasia is presence of abnormal cells which can easily be treated by loop diathermy.

EDIT: please continue using condoms as they prevent against other STIs and unwanted pregnancies. Just know that HPV can be transmitted through sexual contact, fingers etc and there is no shame in having caught the virus in this way. Also please attend pap smears. Right I promise to stop going on :)"
MakeupRehab,ffeqkmx,t3_et1hs4,1579860567.0,"It's rare that I look at an eyeshadow palette and think ""I want it"". To me, the colours often look either too dark or too light and that puts me off. 

The challenge for me is foundations. I love looking at them and I often feel the urge to buy. I am trying to use up the ones I have at the moment though but it can take a lot of willpower sometimes."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffenwal,t1_ffenmpe,1579856512.0,You seem charming.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffenl7x,t1_ffdgedl,1579856059.0,"An ex of mine cheated on me. I never look at him and his girlfriend now and think ""why not me"" I think ""thank fuck it's not me"". 

I sleep like a baby at night, doubt his gf does the same and neither does Taylor, I imagine."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffeni25,t1_ffdjpxm,1579855929.0,"Tread lightly. If a guy said that to me I would be like tread your backside lightly out of my door, mate."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffenf0h,t1_ffe8kb3,1579855804.0,"HPV can be transmitted through sexual contact. It's incredibly common to have and unless you are advocating abstinence, it might not be a good idea to shame people for having a virus that is incredible common/is not preventable through condom use."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffemweo,t1_ffdxuwi,1579855049.0,Preach
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffemw0s,t3_et0jib,1579855034.0,"Yes, because moving in together is a bigger commitment than having a baby with someone. 
This guy is diabolical. It's shocking how far looks can really get one in life."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffemqs6,t1_ffdpgho,1579854825.0,She's so fortunate to have access to excellent therapy. I wish I did.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffemkfw,t1_ffdq42a,1579854579.0,"It really is. The press here are run by right-wing millionaires and they are gunning for Harry and Meghan.
I think Meghan thought that she could court publicity in the same way that celebrities do in the US, but the British press are relentless and they will be even more rabid now. You couldn't pay me to be a royal, it's a horrendous life."
callmebyyourname,ffemfax,t3_et2ftl,1579854382.0,"I saw the first time a few months ago and I was heartbroken by it too! Seriously obsessed. 
But with everything, you move on bit by bit. This is by far my favourite romantic film, but I don't think about it nearly as much as I did that first week. I cried my eyes out. 
Check out ""God's own country"". That's another really beautiful film. 
Welcome to our little club :)"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffbkptx,t1_ffa8llp,1579769979.0,Right? What's wrong with re-wearing clothes?
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffbkk4b,t1_ffbf1z8,1579769741.0,You can. The Queen's uncle did the same thing when he abdicated from the throne. It comes with a shitstorm though and Harry and Meghan won't ever really fully be able to withdraw into obscurity. I feel for Meghan and the fact that she has been hounded - I think she underestimated how low the press sinks here in the UK.

callmebyyourname,ff6sund,t3_erq9s3,1579634174.0,"It's a beautiful film, isn't it? It's art to me. Beautiful, inspiring art. 

I was just like you! Crying the few days following the movie, unable to stop thinking about it, my heart just nostalgic for being 18 and open to the world. And the love they have for each other is the stuff of dreams. 

But you have to remember that art is made as beautiful as you can imagine. It's also unrealistic. They were in the honeymoon, limerence stage of love where everything is rosy and peachy ;).

We never saw them move past that stage into the stage where the way elio slurps his tea annoys the living fuck out of Oliver, or the pair of them calling each other to discuss the broken water heater. 

Neither of them have any flaws, really. They speak perfectly and they're adorably vulnerable but people aren't like that in real life. And that's ok. 

Enjoy the beauty of the film, its wonderful that it's opened your heart. Take that open heart into the real world and try to live a bit more like Elio. That's how I like to think about it."
BreakUps,ff6qy7x,t3_ertauv,1579633031.0,"The 180 is the thing that always surprises me. They go from being sweet, attentive and loving. They act like they want to give you the moon. 

Then suddenly it shifts. That person evaporates and all you're left with is an apparition, wondering if it was all just lies. 

It's something I can never get my head around either."
NetflixBestOf,ff2m4yh,t1_fc60fcn,1579512747.0,"I found Beck and her friends insufferable too. By the end of season one I thought, I don't care what happens to any of these characters."

MakeupRehab,femw8te,t1_fel1cys,1579271251.0,I hate the packaging too. It's cheap and tacky.

depression,feml8yx,t3_epvkbp,1579261106.0,"I am angry too. 

My boss just hired someone who has no applied experience in a role the same as mine. I had to have 4 years of experience to get hired and this douchebag strolls in and gets the job after having no real experience. I am so annoyed. 

I am going to ramp up my job hunt. Sick of working in a place that has no standards or requirements, sick of being in this thankless job."

BeautyGuruChatter,femf6ki,t1_fek8ab3,1579252316.0,I hope so too. I loved using Crucifix lip liner as an eyeliner because it's the only brown liner that DOESN'T come out a weird grey colour on my lids
