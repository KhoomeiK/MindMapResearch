bipolar,fe9s82t,t3_enyftw,1578940986.0,"My grandmother who also suffers from mental illness told me this, and it completely changed my mindset. It’s helped me a lot, so if it’s okay I’d like to share it with you and everyone else. 

“You may have bipolar, but the bipolar does NOT have you.”  

Don’t let it control you and your life. Trust me, I know it’s a lot easier said than done. But if you can just push yourself to do something, even as simple as going to class, be proud of it. Doing a load of laundry. Reading your favorite book. Going outside for just a few minutes. Literally any small thing. You have defeated it a little just from that. Every small accomplishment is a win over our bipolar. And when you do, be PROUD! Hope this helps :)"
