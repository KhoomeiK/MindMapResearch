college,ff7anvl,t1_ff7ah4n,1579644790.0,Oh man thank you. I’ve been worrying on this for weeks but I’ve been hesitating to post anything because I just feel like that makes me not good enough to pursue a life in medicine. It makes me feel a lot better that you relate and have stuff that’s helped you. I’ll be sure to try that idea:)
