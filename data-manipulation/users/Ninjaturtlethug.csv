rpghorrorstories,ffgpr9t,t3_etj4xm,1579911950.0,I think you kinda have to give players some amount to leeway for sometimes acting as a player rather than their character.  It's hard to separate the two.

I think just play it as soon as he arrives, stop it when he leaves, they wont know it's his song the first time, but they will from then on."
DMAcademy,ffg5ysg,t3_etgf0y,1579899174.0,I am having trouble comprehending the body of this post.
SelfAwarewolves,fffpx0z,t1_fffokn6,1579889240.0,"First off, I'd like to apologize for assuming you were another reddit nutjob.

I seem to just have more and more questions whenever you give me an answer, so I will stop bugging you and go ahead and read Marx for myself. 

Thanks for your time."
SelfAwarewolves,fffnepm,t1_fffjyx3,1579887704.0,"Not sure why that deserved a downvote, it was an honest question.

The amish redistribute based on need, they cooperate and share, and typically the reason they shun technology isnt for weird religious reasons but because they want to stay separate from our economic system as much as possible.

I dont think solving scarcity is possible without star trek style fabricators, am I wrong?

Another honest question, why is saving scarcity a requirement for a true communist society? And  Is it a requirement in theory, or a requirement in practicality?"
SelfAwarewolves,fffe06j,t1_ffe8b33,1579881885.0,What about the amish? Do you see that society as successfully communist?
SelfAwarewolves,fff9jfv,t1_fff67gg,1579879045.0,"You know what, fair enough, you've convinced me on some points, but not on others.  We can agree to disagree on the rest.  Have a nice day."
SelfAwarewolves,fff5j24,t1_fff54gn,1579876239.0,"I agree reality has nuance. ""Communism isnt a type of government"" was what I was referring to when I told the guy to read a third grade text.

His definition of communism is not the definition of communism used by the rest of society.  Hes speaking an entirely different language and has the balls to tell me to read a book."
SelfAwarewolves,fff43se,t1_fff3ybz,1579875182.0,"I'm sorry your education didnt teach you negative numbers in third grade, did you go to the same school system as the original commenter?"
SelfAwarewolves,fff3q92,t1_fff2a4o,1579874890.0,"It's called confirmation bias.

Considering my original comment was about reddit voting habits, I'll argue it doesn't apply here.

Shall I post a liberal version of a self aware wolves post to remove any doubt?  I can refer you to it."
SelfAwarewolves,fff3lrp,t1_fff24r9,1579874795.0,"Those books are written by people with doctorates, that's why they are used to teach. 

What is your underlying argument here, that multiplication is bullshit, therefore so is social studies?"
SelfAwarewolves,ffe8tin,t1_ffe8oti,1579839851.0,I'm sorry to hear you wasted your money.
SelfAwarewolves,ffe8lq1,t1_ffe8ilr,1579839675.0,"Fair enough.  Your definition of fascist is also incorrect.

I'd recommend a 3rd grade social studies book."
SelfAwarewolves,ffe8er7,t1_ffe8b33,1579839518.0,"You have a bizarre definition of communism then, we aren't even speaking the same language at this point.

Best of luck to you."

Not something I agree with personally, just how it is here.

confusing_perspective,fdt540h,t1_fdsz45n,1578712036.0,"I think your projecting your own anger onto my words.   To you jesus is a sacred treasure not to be joked about.

And to me your religion is the joke.

Atheists dont get angry about the concept of god, or mad at god.  You're correct,  that's absurd. 

What does get me angry is reading about the Pope covering up child rape and preventing victims from obtaining justice, while claiming that birth control or gay people are a greater problem.

Or when muslims blow up school girls for daring to have a voice because their iron age superstitions tell them to.

I get mad when I realize its 2020 and these problems exist because your average human being is too dumb, lazy, indoctrinated, or hateful to realize it's all bullshit. We could/ should have progressed so much further than we have. 

A jesus on a dog's butt doesn't make me angry, it's good clean fun.  A light-hearted joke.

Because he's right where he belongs."
clevercomebacks,fdt04p0,t1_fdsywa2,1578710202.0,"Then I think my original take on your comment was correct, if you were just fucking around then I was right the first time, and I got confused after you elaborated.

I mentioned my marriage because you made a claim I was going to get taken advantage of by a woman, at that point I thought you were being more serious and wanted to demonstrate you weren't correct.

I do have a close friend in that exact situation.  He doesn't have the balls to drop her.

Have a good night."
confusing_perspective,fdsyxa5,t1_fdsyuxd,1578709757.0,"Right,  exactly where it belongs."
clevercomebacks,fdsys36,t1_fdsyocv,1578709700.0,I think we both missed each other's point.

So either I'm lying to you or your worldview is wrong.

You get to decide which one you believe is true."
