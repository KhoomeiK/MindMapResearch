BlackPeopleTwitter,fe1z0sx,t1_fe1yc2q,1578832562.0,"Uhh idk how to do that thing that you’ve done but I’ll do my best. 

I’m not out of the loop. I’m simply from a country who doesn’t appreciate segregation and instead shares culture regardless of skin colour. I think Western society as a whole is incredibly toxic in the way that people like to split themselves into groups and so I’m happy to be Brazilian, although American brainwashing is starting to trickle in. But just a quick reminder that just because you think something is appropriation and therefore offensive, doesn’t mean it is.

There’s a big issue with appropriation because SOME people consider a specific situation to be appropriation but others don’t. When it’s a thing that doesn’t have a general consensus I don’t think it’s fair for you to blame the “perpetrator” completely. I think there are situations that people call appropriation when it’s completely unnecessary.

And again, making this meme is not a good idea because it heavily implies very racist and ignorant ideas. Whether that’s because of the simple format of a meme or not is really irrelevant because the damage is done.

It’s like a white person making a racist joke. Maybe just don’t do it."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe1y2pt,t1_fe1xh6j,1578832212.0,"I think it’s totally fair to be worried and to fight against appropriation. I can see how someone could feel it’s a huge deal. Personally, I come from a country where all culture is shared regardless of skin colour so I don’t personally feel that appropriation is a huge issue. But I can feel empathy for someone like you who likely comes from a culture that has gone through some severe segregation, which is really unfortunate. Even though I disagree with some of the examples you came up with but that’s due to my country of origin.

Like sure, fight appropriation. I’ll support you in that. But don’t say that white culture is appropriation. It’s incorrect and ignorant. And also highly offensive. And also not a black person’s place to make that assertion."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fe1v2eq,t1_fe1u73o,1578831155.0,"“If white culture were an image.” Implies that the picture shown encapsulates the whole of white culture. If we’re gonna mess with and make memes about topics that are dangerous and potentially offensive like this one, we should try and be more tactful with it. 

And since when is appropriation a key part of white culture? Just because it’s something you pay attention to a lot of the time because it affects you, doesn’t mean it’s really that relevant in the modern day.

Many white people are too scared of being called racist to even come close to talking about other cultures. Sometimes, when you’re appreciating something, people will accuse you of being a racist.

This meme does not imply anything about a “key” aspect of white culture. It says that THIS IS white culture which is...racist? Ignorant? Bigoted? Hypocritical?"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe1trs1,t1_fe1tf5o,1578830765.0,Haha yeah thanks for continuing it on for me I didn’t feel like giving too much effort to explain that white culture is pretty rich. I appreciate the backup lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe1t66y,t1_fe1s60k,1578830593.0,"Lmao when did I question if it was a thing? You don’t know anything about me, mate. I respect black culture quite a lot. I don’t respect victimhood.

If you’d do some light reading on the history of Brazil then you’d know how modern Brazilian culture is HIGHLY influenced by African/black culture. African cuisine came before white people were in the picture. So did their traditions. So did their lifestyles. Stop acting like white people were in African enslaving people since the dawn of time.

What you’re doing, defining black culture and black people as mere “survivors of white people” is incredibly sad and devalues that true richness and wonder of black culture. It’s an insult to black people who are much more than that. That is the definition of a victim mentality and insulting someone isn’t gonna get you anywhere. Just makes your argument less valid.

By saying black culture is surviving white culture, you’re effectively giving all the power back to white people, so congratulations."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe1s6q1,t1_fe1rq2k,1578830294.0,"I didn’t ask about American Black culture. The world is far wider (pun intended) than that. I asked about black culture. 

But I guess since African Americans can sometimes have such an intense victim mentality it’s hard to believe that other Afro-descendants don’t have white people as much as they do. Some people just can’t seem to learn that victimhood just makes you seem...small?"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe1rec9,t1_fe1r0di,1578830029.0,"Yeah sure they’ve done that in the past. I really don’t see how that defines their whole culture though. You literally can’t argue against the points I made about ballet, pasta etc, because that’s literally what makes up part of white culture.

Culture isn’t “let’s take the bad things this group has done and make it their whole identity” because then black culture would be selling slaves to white people. Just because you feel hurt and held back by what white people have done in the past doesnt:

a) Make it their whole identity
b) Give you the right to define a culture that isn’t yours

If you dislike what white people have done in the past, then don’t do it either. Eye for an eye makes the world blind."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe1r10o,t1_fe1qnnw,1578829855.0,"To be honest, that seems like a massive victim mindset coming from you. When I think of black culture I think of the people who helped to build my homeland, and their rich cuisine, music and lifestyle.

If you’re so willing to define black culture as victims of white people, then I understand where the ignorance in global understanding comes from. I hope you’re able to get past that and learn what it means, for yourself, to be black."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe1psmz,t1_fe1p20g,1578829478.0,"Yeah I can agree with that, but that doesn’t mean it’s their culture. So many countries are white-predominant and it’s irresponsible and ignorant to say that white “culture” is appropriating. 

White culture are things like:
Ballet
Pasta
Knights
Medieval Castles
Gothic Architecture
Classical Music
Cheeseburgers

And if you think about it even more, Latino culture is technically partially white culture. Hear me out. I’m Brazilian. My culture has massive African and indigenous influences, yes. But also from the Portuguese, Italian and Spanish. So in a sense, Latino culture is also a part of whit culture. At least it is as white as it is African.

Like sure white people appropriate and steal but like...so does literally every other race. Just because white people may or may not do it the most doesn’t mean it’s their culture. And, frankly, if black people don’t want to be defined by white people’s standards then I don’t think they should try and define white culture because they have no idea of what it’s like."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fe1inf7,t1_fe1ik13,1578826891.0,"Yeah of course they do, sometimes. But it’s not white culture at all. That’s like saying that white people’s whole identity is appropriating."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe1hwwz,t3_enksq1,1578826739.0,"Ngl calling this white culture is very offensive when all it is is an image of cultural appropriation, not white culture. But it’s okay a black person said it so it’s not racist."

But I do agree with you there."
AgeGapRelationship,fdm17m5,t1_fdm0mxl,1578537380.0,"That makes sense. I guess technically speaking any couple who are not of very similar ages are age gap. And I mean it’s not up to me to impose an identity or to strip it from a couple who identifies as being an age gap relationship. 

Their literal gap in age may be small but the struggles and experiences may be similar. But for example, my mum and dad are 3 years apart and both in their late 50s. It feels inappropriate to call them an age gap relationship, you know? Their lives are so similar at this age that they see no difference."
AgeGapRelationship,fdm02yb,t1_fdm00m0,1578536615.0,"Yeah situations like that are really complicated cause it’s like, do you still consider yourself to be in an age gap relationship?"

AgeGapRelationship,fdly9i7,t1_fdls0r1,1578535368.0,"It’s not gatekeeping. At all. It’s just a label that’s misleading given the fact that what a lot of people consider to be an age gap relationship is much larger than 7 years. Especially as people get older, that small of a gap tends to get really insignificant and it’s hard/a stretch to even label it as age gap.

That’s just my opinion. Not gatekeeping."
AgeGapRelationship,fdlo4eg,t1_fdlo0mq,1578528461.0,"I think age of consent works differently in England, where I live. It’s so wishy washy that people just stay away from people under 18 just in case.

AgeGapRelationship,fdlnkut,t1_fdlnfuv,1578528088.0,"Yeah I agree with that. I guess the status of a relationship being “age gap” should be dependent on the individuals’ ages.

Christianity,fdlfbsm,t1_fdleod4,1578522797.0,"I think everybody absolutely knows that the US is happy to act on acts that they consider to be threatening to their beloved freedom. Nobody thinks the US is a perfectly peaceful nation who allows themselves to be screwed over.

Sure, things happened against the US to incite some sort of revenge. And although I think that the guy’s death overall was a good thing, the least Trump could’ve done is consult other world leaders and, I dunno, either tried to: negotiate, warn or make a simpler, less groundbreaking attack on Iran.

In killing him, Iran has become much more hostile than they were before. It was a rash decision, something the current President is almost synonymous with at this point. If we’re being realistic, a lot of people are praising trump for doing it for the sake of “protecting [their] freedom”. Now, it’s even debatable whether Americans have that much freedom at all but that’s another conversation. My point is that Iran could never significantly threaten the US because of their utter lack of power and global influence relative to the US.

I think the attack, although it had a decent short-term outcome, might have serious consequences for Iranians and Americans stationed near/in Iran. There’s a reason people are mad. And it’s not just to join the Trump hate train. World leaders with so much power should not have such a quick trigger finger and be so explosive and unexpected (kinda pun intended)."
