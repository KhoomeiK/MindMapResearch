PlantBasedDiet,fdgqdmv,t1_fdgcrsg,1578405567.0,"Not sautéing onions...I don’t notice a difference, but it’s always one of many ingredients in a soup or stew. Also, maybe my palette isn’t that refined yet.  I might get fussier in years to come.
I  stir all the ingredients together.
I do not store food in the instant pot...i use gasket sealed class containers...the food lasts longer and the instant pot is free for its next task.
When I was first learning how to use the pot, I did experience overflow and so it did hit the “burn” cycle...which is to say that the pot senses a burn, turns off its heating element, and displays “burn”.
We have the 6 qt for the two of us and it’s working well. I now make half recipes...I’m finding the second effortless meal of split pea soup is yummy, the 3rd meal is not so appetizing. And the instant pot has made it less cumbersome to cook.  Honestly, I look at the batch cooking ...5 of the same meal, and it just looks so unappetizing. To eat the rainbow and to eat fresh, you have to change it up!"
PlantBasedDiet,fdeexht,t1_fdec0hh,1578337541.0,"Omg, I just wrote a lengthy email about the instant to a group of us who are doing a reset / a cleanse. Maybe you will find this helpful as well.

The bottom line is that we simply eat healthier since we’ve had the instant pot. It's been a game changer in our home.

I have a tiny kitchen and never would have bought this huge appliance. My mother-in-law gifted it to me 3 christmases ago, and she said, try it, if you don't like it, send it to me and I will get you something else. (one of my large pots is now in the basement, and the instant pot is on the sliding shelf that my husband had to install because I use it so often)

Turns out it's been a game changer. The onboarding took some effort, but once I figured out how to properly seal it, run it and clean it …. it became necessary for staples and some other simple cooking… rice, quinoa, steel-cut oatmeal, beans, beets, artichokes.  

In the past year I’ve explored with “dump” meals and its working out very well.  At first I would use the saute function for onions and garlic, then add ingredients for a soup or stew  … but now I just put it all in, “dump it”, and let it cook. 

Pro’s/Con’s?  I think they made a mistake by marketing that a dish can cook in ie “5 minutes”... because it does need warm up and cool down time, so yeah it takes as long to make rice in the instant pot as it does on the stove BUT
you don't have to sit in the kitchen to occasionally stir the rice
you don't have to sit in the kitchen to turn off the heat when its done
when you decide to eat...maybe ten, twenty or more minutes after its done, its still warm
since the pot is completely sealed, not only is it safe, but it keeps in all the heat - so its actually been useful in the summer for cooking something hot without heating up the house and making the AC work harder
its made it easier to cook without oils - which I have recently discovered is a big deal in the plant-based community
because it makes cooking healthy things so easy and pretty much fool- proof, we just eat more quinoa and soup and….
and we’re a little more environmentally sound for it - its more energy efficient and I am buying more bulk food in paper bags (which I compost) .
we’re simply healthier, and happier with it."

PlantBasedDiet,fdcp0gx,t1_fdcmrth,1578280413.0,"So, for a new recipe, I type it up before making it the first time ... just when it peaks my interest enough.
During the first cooking, I use a print out and a pen in the kitchen to check as I progress thru ingredient list and instruction ... making small notes and editing as I go.
Typically the next day or couple of days, I will update the document.
I think I started only doing it on the weekends, when I had time to cook and think about my diet.
Even if you did one/week, by the end of the year you will have 52 custom recipes. ...that’s pretty much half a cook book.
(I’ve also taped some recipes to inside of my cabinets ... salad dressing recipes, smoothies and some vegan mayo...the staples)
AND when I have dinner parties, I offer the recipes up ...look this is what we’re having ...it sparks conversation AND I caught / well he caught a food allergy before digging into a dish! See...this method could even save lives :)) it wasn’t a life threatening allergy, but still, you don’t want someone to not feel well because they ate at your house!"

PlantBasedDiet,fdccvqm,t3_ekinw2,1578271834.0," My big... my HUGE workflow success story has been typing up recipes in google docs. I think I started in 2014 and since then I’ve optimized the format of each recipe for my kitchen, my equipment, my preferences.  I have the ingredients on the left column of a table and the instructions on the right side, so no matter where something is sourced from ....they are all formatted the same way. I started with 1 document per recipe, but in time that just became heavy, then I consolidated all soups in a soup doc, this past year I realized that my personal behavior, my meal prep starts with ....” so I have this butternut squash because it was on sale and looked beautiful....what am I going to do with it?”....so now my docs are organized by main/primary ingredient.  I have one for veggies...winter squash and one for veggies... summer squash, and so on. And since it’s digital, now I’m able to search for the less common ingredients I have but need to use more... “miso, “chipotle”, “macadamia”.  I was dairy friendly in 2014, but as that phased out, I was able to phase it out of my docs, I was oil friendly until very recently, and now I’m able to phase that out of some beloved recipes. The recipe typing also chimes with my efforts to be more mindful, it’s almost a meditation. I even sometimes journal  “2016: made this for richard’s birthday, he loved it” ...it’s a nice little memory :) and next time Richard came over ... I knew exactly what to make.
I would strongly recommend that everyone start to digitally personalize their recipes! It’s been a huge win."
