politics,ffe30is,t1_ffddylo,1579835374.0,"Regarding the ""affair"", Monica wasn't a victim. I wish people would stop with this retelling. She wanted that man, she went after him and got a little bit of him. He did not seek her out. This is by her own contemporaneous accounting of what occurred. It was an unethical goal but it WAS a goal she set, nonetheless.

As the poster above me said, if Linda Tripp and the Republicans hadn't made this into this HUGE public shaming of Bill, Monica would have gone on with wild youthful memories that no one would have believed anyway (hence how she got suckered by Tripp- she was giddy and constantly kind of bragging about it to her).

She was used by the repubs but not by Bill.

Bill, meanwhile, is a cheating son of a bish who regularly gets handsy with women who aren't his wife. This is 100% truth. But this is no #metoo moment and it's insulting to those who HAVE suffered workplace assault, including those Bill may have assaulted but Monica was NOT one of them."

Unfounded rumor alert:

Heard a podcast of a young man who used to prostitute himself out to rich men- especially politicians. He said that there is a well- known undercover gay repub who is often on tv who used his services. The kick is that he looks VERY young and he play acts at being a child with this man. He said he had to stop because it sickened him. It is speculated that Lindsey is the guy."

Why do regular people complain about lawsuits against corporations or even small businesses? There are requirements for doing business. Having access is one of them.

If the businesses are vunerable to suit because of lack of compliance, that's THEIR problem. OUR problem is that we need proper access. If they won't do it voluntarily, they will be made to do so. 

Also, a business is notified first to fix the issue. Being dragged into court isn't going to be their first notice of an issue."

Then, in the early 80s, exclusively self-serve gas stations arrived  and, of course, ALLLLL the rest of the gas stations followed suit. They never miss an opportunity to get rid of employees. This also began the decrease of SERVICE STATIONS (with mechanics and gas as most were). 

So now, my arthritic 76 year old mother must hobble to the inside way across the kinda big lot to pay (won't pay with card at pump due to scams), hobble back and pump her own gas, with a walker.
