AsOneAfterInfidelity,ff6uso6,t3_ery2ah,1579635316.0,"I'm only about a month out from D-day and every day there are new ones. For example, I had been considering dying my hair red for a long time. Like I'd spent HOURS upon hours on Pinterest looking for ideas.  Unfortunately AP is a ginger. It fills me with irrational anger that I can't dye my hair now because I'm afraid it will make my WH think of her when he looks at me. It seems so silly and insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but it really bothers me every time I think about it. Any time I see a woman with red hair, it makes me a little sick.

No ginger jokes please."
