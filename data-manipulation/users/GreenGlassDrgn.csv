And I wonder if this cant all be boiled down to Maslows hierarchy of needs - so many people in polarized countries are threatened by so many different things, at some point there isnt energy left for higher ambitions, all they want is food, shelter and acceptance, and anyone/any idea who seems to pose a threat to those three things needs to burn."

PCOS,ffwl1nx,t3_evk9z7,1580304355.0,"I have a weird dual role in this. One one hand, I have PCOS. On the other, I have several positions in life that give me access to doctors beyond their professional opinions, so we can talk in a frank and honest way. I dont necessarily agree with what I've heard, but I'll share what they tell me.   
I've had several doctors explain to me that its virtually impossible as a doctor, as an external motivator, to get the vast majority of people to change their lifestyle  - people have to want to do it on their own, for themselves (once you've got a patient self-motivating, its much smoother sailing). It is at best an exercise in futility, at worst a way to offend and lose patients who might never return to the healthcare system. Apparently very similar to when bank advisors tell people with poor finances to quit smoking to save money - its not wrong, but very personal, and anything less than the perfect approach will usually blow up in their faces.   
A pill is a simple easy sort-of-solution that doesnt require lifestyle change, literally a more palatable answer than ""you have to change your entire way of life"". It doesnt offend as many people to suggest a pill. And, according to them, if your particular pill isnt working for you, there is a whole rainbow of alternative pills to try (and also to deflect negative reactions). Its also kind of a gateway for change - once a person considers the pills crap, but still wants to change things, maybe the person will be more open to other kinds of lifestyle changes."
solotravel,ffwjmje,t3_evjiun,1580303147.0,"I try to do this at home too. Unfortunately the weather is shit and there is a 5km walk between towns if the sky opens up when you are out wandering.

But now I also know so much more about local areas and history than many other people my age. I couldnt get lost around here if I wanted to. I miss doing that.  
  
Its my favorite part about travelling, just exploring without a plan and following your own curiosity. As for food - I suck at feeding myself abroad for the exact same reason as you - for my own wellbeing I try to find a local gas station or 7/11 and grab some (expensive) fruit or yogurt or cheese for breakfast, or else it'll be 4PM by the time I decide on breakfast (though some places like the US are horrible enablers for me by having 24/7 breakfast menus)."

politics,ffewa9a,t1_ffec1g3,1579868185.0,"I disagree.  
I am a dual citizen. The people who fought against nazism in my mother's country were the grandparents of my friends. My friends grew up hearing stories about how crazy grandpa got too drunk to fly that one bad mission, how grandma had been mocked and abused by her neighbors for falling in love with a man from the other side of the border. These are stories of family pride. My first real apartment was built on top of the ruins of the place where German POWs were kept after the war, a place my great aunt walked past frequently as a little girl.  I can take you to places where they blew up train rails, sat as sharpshooters in attics, and were gunned down like dogs for fighting the good fight.    
       
Everyone in my other country knows stories and names of people who fought against nazism, and they are proud of it. The country's policy was actually neutral during the war, the germans could come and go as they pleased, and there was no way a small country like that could've stood against such a strong neighbor, but listening to the stories nowadays, its very clear whose side the people were on. And they remember, in a very tangible way."
