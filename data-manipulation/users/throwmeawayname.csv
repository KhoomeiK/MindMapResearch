Full quote:
“I’m not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who’s currently in the Democratic primary and they’re grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said in an interview for Plouffe’s Campaign HQ podcast. “She’s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far and that’s assuming Jill Stein will give it up because she’s also a Russian asset.”
Nowhere in there is she claiming Tulsi works for or with Russians. Merely being eyed to head toward 3rd party and split the vote again. And considering Tulsi's actions since then, Hillary hasn't seemed far off with this.

I actually encountered a few European bots shilling for Tulsi earlier tonight on Twitter, replying to any negative post they could find about her. Expressing a thought about a candidate isn't defamation, especially when he have hard evidence of bot farms and propaganda from overseas to split the voter base.

That's vastly different than obtaining a position paid for by taxpayers and getting to write/decide legislation and speak for the people.

Rape and assault are extremely hard to prove if there aren’t other witnesses, true. Its extremely hard to come forward as a victim, sometimes can take years (as a male victim, I can definitely attest to this). We have cops, friends/family, public, and even judges trying to downplay or shift blame to alleged victims. We have hundreds of thousands of rape kits untested and some stored away in units for years. Very much more often than not, sexual assault and rape victims have odds stacked against them, even just coming forward. A lot of the men accused publicly have a pattern of behaviors/victims, so its easier to put cases against those folks. But when we have people coming to defense of people accused with “well they’ve always been nice to me and never did anything like that, so they must be innocent” is as ridiculous as “well the murderer never murdered ME, so they must be a good person”"
