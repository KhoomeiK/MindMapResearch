gaming,ffa2plr,t1_ff9imoz,1579726694.0,"I loved in FFX how there'd be a five minute cut scene that was unskipable which jumped directly into a boss fight. So if you died, you'd have to watch the whole thing again."
Machinists,ferfc8d,t1_feoulzg,1579353249.0,"My favorite time was that time when I was replacing a center drill, and the fucking castle wrench slipped off and I broke a coolant thru .062 30x drill worth $350 and had made only about 30 parts."
Unexpected,fereadm,t1_feomfbs,1579352885.0,"All of that being true, I feel like it should be pointed out that certain tools demand the utmost respect because they can fuck your day up in an instant. Common examples would be chainsaws, band saws, and table saws. 

In my case I'm around manual and cnc mills and lathes every day. They also will rip or cut off appendages and not even slow down. 

When you don't respect a tool, it can make you complacent, and complacency loses you a finger, an eye, a leg, a life. 

TLDR don't make tools more dangerous than they already are."

I listened to Dune through Chapterhouse sequentially back to back. Because I can abuse the audible return system, I wanted to see what Frank's plans were.
