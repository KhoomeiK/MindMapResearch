The fight for shared parental leave is done chiefly to benefit women in their careers. Feminists have not historically fought for men to be fathers in their own right without the mother wanting it and have opposed measures that equalize parenting. They don't support parental leave to ""Help men"", but rather to help women. You can tell this is the case from their routine opposition to fathers rights where the mother doesn't stand to benefit.

On Rape;
Fixing their own fuck up is not good enough. Mary Koss (Feminist) Testified to the government to get males excluded from the definition in the first place, then feminists spent decades demonizing men based on those statistics, and many feminists still do and still peddle those lopsided stats from a biased definition.

In Prisons:
Furthering the anti-male narrative feminists pushed on rape while gaslighting everyone and pretending to care about men too and not be seen as raging sexists requires they act like they take male on male rape seriously. This also allowed them to shut down discussion on male rape victims for around two decades by claiming they were handling it, despite ignoring the overwhelming majority of victims and suppressing statistics of them existing and to frame the conversation around male rape as being sourced in male perpetrators. That's not ""Helping men"", that's demonizing them and controlling the narrative to prevent criticism of women or acknowledgement of them perpetrating rapes.

Draft:
It was a Mens Rights group that got the court ruling to equalize the draft. Feminists threw a fit over it when it happened and whined they were making things worse for women out of spite.

There's other stuff too, such as the Duluth model of domestic violence and its European equivalent the Istanbul convention, which uses the state to back up women abusers to the detriment of their male victims.

Like, i'm sure as a party activist you can see the problem. If the only way you can get voters to say they like your guy is by frontloading the polling question, that's a big problem compared to not doing that and them pushing single figure support. Consider as well that straight polling on ""Do you support gender equality"" pushes 80% support, which means that even when prompted with ""Feminism means gender equality"", the vast majority of people still refuse to identify as one and at best you're tricking one or two in ten people to change their minds for the sake of a poll question.""

It's akin to polling people on say, Jeremy Corbyn, by saying; ""Do you support policy X? Policy Y? Policy Z? Are you worried about media bias undermining change? Are you concerned about the danger of war with Iran? Do you support Jeremy Corbyn?"". The old ""Yes minister"" tactic. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0ZZJXw4MTA

In the case of polls on feminism, often they'll be pushed with questions on womens issues, asked If they support equality, then told feminism means gender equality, and asked if they are a feminist. It's not something people tend to identify as without those tactics, and their identification ends the moment the poll does.

EDIT; Having read the ""original"" for the source you supplied, even the conducters of the poll say the results contrasts with previous independent research showing support in the 7% to 20% range from multiple independent sources. It's an extreme outlier poll and you should be cautious accepting its results. Notably, they aren't publishing the data table or methodology, you have to request it and they'll send it by email. That's pretty shifty mate, unless the conductors have decided it is such an outlier poll that they are not comfortable publishing the results, which they might sometimes do even though it's bad for the field of study. (It prevents others learning what they did wrong, which if it's embarrassing enough might be worth the cost of being seen to hinder progress by preventing others seeing the mistake and going 'We'll account for that next time'.). That's the benign explanation, the best case scenario. (I study polling.).

They oppose it because of slavery.

Similarly some feminist drinking a male tears mug might irritate people, but the reason people dislike feminists is policy like the duluth model, or NOW (The largest feminist organization in the world) opposing joint-custody, and so on.

I don't much agree feminism was valid in the first wave either. The second one is where a load of the abuses against men on a legal level started. The first wave was a conspiracy theory that the reason women couldn't vote was some plot to oppress them, but the historical consensus is that the interest simply wasn't there among women to vote, so they never demanded it in large numbers. When they did, they got the vote. What got women interested wasn't feminism, but socialism and working class politics, and this also reflects the historical reality.

Upper class women were divided between; ""No, no votes for the poor. Targret the women."" and feminist conspiracy theories. Other women were part of the mass suffrage movement demanding votes for everyone on the basis of humanist principles and socialism. Offering the vote to men first was an attempt by the upper class to split the movement, which didn't work. In countries where men got the vote before women due to mass suffrage movements, the average is 5 years before women got it. (I.E, the men then elected a government who promised to give it to women.). After this, upper class feminists celebrated their ""Victory"" and claimed credit, and used their influence to force that meme into the public consciousness, despite history not aligning with it. Which obviously was obliged, because letting the poors know that they just demonstrated how to defeat the rich through mass protest, riots, assassinations and strike action is bad.

The cases where this isn't true are France and the USA, where a republic was achieved through armed rebellion rather than erosion of aristocracy, and the vote was given to combatants. In those countries, voting was tied to conscription, but this was ignored by feminist campaigners and the resulting inequalities still exist in the US, though in France were resolved.

They're called ""Suffragettes"" for a reason. Most didn't believe in feminism. It's always been a fringe position in society, over-represented in culture because it is popular among upper class women and represents their particular pathological response to their privilege and trying to justify it, in their case by ignoring it and believing in conspiracy theories and becoming borderline hallucinatory, much like upper class men have their own neurotic coping mechanisms, in their case by largely deciding to become sociopaths who think predatory behavior is normal."

From the text:
""When it comes to therapy, existing evidence suggests that some approaches work much better than others for men. For example, the charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has over the past two decades been offering telephone and online support, along with community support programmes, targeted particularly at younger men who are vulnerable to suicide. CALM still remains one of the few help organisations that has deliberately set out to create a gender-specific and male-friendly ethos (Holloway et al. 2018).""

+

""There is additional evidence, however, that even our supposedly gender-neutral counselling and therapy services are inherently ‘feminised’ in that they offer a ‘talk-based’ approach based on direct face-to-face emotional exploration which is more congruent with evolved female patterns of communication than it is with male styles of emotional processing and functioning (Morison et al. 2014). The findings of Holloway et al. (2018) support this view: interviews with 20 experienced clinical psychologists, psychotherapists and counsellors found that, on average, male clients want a practical “fix” for their problems, whereas women want to explore their feelings.""

+

""It should therefore be acknowledged that the surface problem of men not talking or seeking help can also be seen as rooted in a deeper problem of therapy services, and society as a whole, not being receptive or empathic to the male gender. It’s perhaps not so much that men won’t talk, but that society isn’t listening. In this regard, Seager et al. (2014b) refer to the concept of ‘male gender blindness’ when describing how men’s needs are often implicitly overlooked, which also helps to explain why the question of whether men have specific needs from therapy is one that is seldom even asked (Golden 2013; Kingerlee et al. 2014).""

+

""in terms of gender, there is evidence that the professional help typically on offer is routinely blind to the needs and preferences of men,""

+

""However, our response to male distress reverts back to urging men to use the services that they are already avoiding rather than thinking of ways to design approaches that will connect better with men.""

+

""The resulting situation is a ‘stand-off’ whereby men’s distress is plain enough through their actions, but the response is to repeat the same verbal and emotional messages to them.

I.E, the approach feminists urged you to take on this issue? Is the problem in the first place, and the evidence shows it. This is often how feminism operates, by misframing issues in such a way that mens issues perpetuated and remain unfixed, while pretending it cares about resolving those issues. This is sometimes deliberate malice from the feminist, sometimes they don't know any better and have bought in to the lie that it's an equality movement, and sometimes it's because they apply an ideology constructed to exclude mens experiences and issues while framing everything around women and this is the natural result. This whole thing is one example of how your ""There is no sexism against men"" view blinded you to the institutional bias against men here leading to these suicides. In your case, your belief in feminist ideology led you to espouse a view (""Open up more"") that causes this issue to go unresolved, and which people who study it without ideological preconceptions have concluded is part of the problem in the first place. This happened because you don't believe in sexism against men, so you didn't look for it and you didn't find it. So you could never fix it."

She developed a fear of ""Going to work"" because she knew she'd just be being bullied all day and after staying home instead of going she concludes we have the most awful yet effective queue-enforcement mechanism in the entire world, and that queueing is so ingrained into us that we do it alone sometimes, and often without the need for a physical queue, so it really is a british trait.

For another, the UK system was founded by a series of shenanigans and corruption scandals that left most of parliament controlled by a single MP, variously through them owing him their positions or them being scared of him releasing what he knew, who became the first prime minister, Robert Walpole.

&#x200B;

That wasn't \*meant\* to happen. But after that, our system was pretty much built around the notion that there's a guy, and he can tell you how you must vote, and he's in charge of the cabinet, and so on. It became normalized, probably because he's the longest serving prime minister too at 21 years.

Without the south sea bubble incident and the subsequent ""Woopsie daisy, looks like I have a file on over half of parliament being crooks, and those who refuse to play ball fwill ind themselves named and replaced."", our system would resemble the US a lot more. We'd probably have internal party selections for the various ministries, and no particular head of government.

The US is in many ways a response to the ""dysfunction"" of the UK system. They explicitly separated the executive and his appointees from the congress and senate, and the result of there being no party leader may well be the intended outcome."

The CDC study is notable because it thought to measure the amount of men forced to penetrate, but didn't count them as rape.
