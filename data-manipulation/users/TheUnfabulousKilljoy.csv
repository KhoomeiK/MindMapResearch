politics,ff6s00g,t1_ff6hw9x,1579633660.0,I hate to say it but I've recently taken up encouraging my mom not to vote just because she exclusively votes R and ignores any discussion about it.
videos,ff6jyfj,t1_ff63fen,1579628807.0,"Yeah this one is actually a bit underrated or unheard of. Just in case you didn't know, I think it was based off an Australian version of the same concept and there are some videos of that on Youtube."
nextfuckinglevel,ff6fjhq,t1_ff6aqcw,1579626096.0,That's incredibly pedantic. Clearly the implication is that it's not a justified excuse.
nextfuckinglevel,ff6f852,t1_ff6aynj,1579625898.0,Sadly it seems like mass shootings are still the mass shootings going into this new decade. Not that I would want killdozers to replace them.
nextfuckinglevel,ff6emh7,t1_ff66qxu,1579625526.0,Based on the start of your username I'd be willing to guess your approximate location.

worldnews,fefwjq8,t1_fefmi0v,1579067530.0,"Hey good for you for sharing this potentially embarrassing experience if it helps others to improve their lives or experiences, I think the world would be exponentially better if we were all less ashamed of our bodies. Just for the record though I am uncircumcised and would never circumcise any sons for non-medical reasons. If we're being candid then ironically I did experience some mild phimosis however that subsided eventually."

worldnews,feepxzz,t1_feepquz,1579038745.0,"I largely agree, but I guess it's just a bit too much of a nuanced subject for me to give any confident opinion on. Just for the record Id never agree to so much as piercing the ears of any infant child I had or care for."
worldnews,feep8ny,t1_feeokpn,1579038342.0,"I agree. If it's because of Jewish or Islamic beliefs then it makes some sense in some ways, but otherwise I would say cosmetic alteration of the body without consent is really a bit barbaric."

StarWars,feci8zs,t1_feaddiv,1578974557.0,This has all made me want to rewatch the prequels but I'm worried that it won't live up to the memories I have of it before I was 10.

Here's a link to a Vox article that mentions that he and three co-founders sold Collegehumor and Vimeo among other assets to IAC in 2006 and that, ironically, his new job at Facebook may well have been what ended up destroying CH. The article doesn't mention that in case it was unclear, that was me speculating. It really is kind of a rabbithole without a ton of clear information."
