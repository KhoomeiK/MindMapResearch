panicatthedisco,ffaqu9p,t3_esiv9f,1579742346.0,Dying in la is really beautiful but honestly I literally never put it on. The one I listen to most is defiantly end of all things which was number 5 on my top 10 most played songs on Spotify in 2019. So that one lol
sleep,ffa0t2n,t1_ff90j6a,1579725589.0,"Hey I was up for another like 2 hours, my mum brought a tv into my room and put Blue Planet on so I could just relax and when I freaked out and was like “I can’t go to sleep” she was like “no just to relax you’re not going to sleep yet” and my exhausted brain actually believed her so I chilled out then fell asleep and it was fine and I had a good sleep, thank you <3"
SuicideWatch,ff8dqnz,t1_ff8cvr4,1579674235.0,Oh fuck. I haven’t been in school all year (since start of September) because of my mental health so if I died they might say I went to a different college if they were asked.. but they wouldn’t even be asked. I’m sure my family would press for them to acknowledge it though
SuicideWatch,ff8cekk,t1_ff8bfd7,1579672803.0,Why would they lie if a student asked what happened to their classmate. That is so fucked up

selfharm,ff5hfl1,t3_eroht5,1579593014.0,I can’t relate to this. It’s like people don’t believe you have an eating disorder unless you’re really thin. I don’t think kids at school (who completely don’t understand depression) will take me seriously unless I have cuts

I first got one that had an outside ‘cover’ that was soft but I had to send it back because the cover was a lot bigger than the blanket so there was like a ruler wide perimeter of no weight around the edge. My new one is perfect though and I really like it :)

SuicideWatch,feazm0l,t1_fe81vpb,1578953908.0,It makes me sort of annoyed that teenagers and people as young as 12 have managed to commit with pills while they probably didn’t know enough about how to do it will pills. I guess it’s luck
SuicideWatch,feaypfu,t3_eo9o49,1578953619.0,"Please.. *please* don’t. Because I would be very sad if you did that. And so would everyone you mentioned. Let’s talk, let’s open a dm where we can begin by saying hi. Life is totally worth it; worth the struggle, worth the pain. It’s a fleeting, trust me. The pain won’t last forever. It may creep back once in a while, but there are so many more good times, and so many reasons to not think so.. inwardly. Also, think about how that’s gonna affect everyone else, people who you might not think care about you, who absolutely do. They might not show it in the ways that they need to, but trust me.

There are a million reasons to stay alive. I know you probably feel exhausted right now but please please let me help you. I just want to help you xx I’m 17 and at your age I felt very similar. I don’t know the first thing about why you feel this way but I may be able to relate with some of the emotions and I can try and support you, because I really want to help you. Could you please dm me? 

Your cat will never understand what happened to you and cats can be extremely distressed when their owners disappear and can even pass away from the distress. There are far too many reasons to keep loving. Your life is just starting and nothing is decided yet in your life. 

Please dm me. I care about you and you can feel better. This pain will not last forever, things will improve."
