HofellerDocuments,ffealol,t1_ffdwzy4,1579841364.0,"Mod here! I’ve got the database ready anytime people want to go through documents more thoroughly. Maybe we can set a date/time and have a megathread where people can post questions or searches, I’ll reply with the results, then people can discuss within each comment thread. I’m more than happy to devote some hours to this, just let me know!"

maybemaybemaybe,ffb8ric,t1_ffb8ati,1579755323.0,"I took a flight from NYC to LAX once and sat with a broadway performer who had just run to the airport from their matinee show. We got to be fast friends and decided to start our movies at the same time so we didn’t spoil it for each other. 

We did the “3, 2, 1, start!” method and it worked perfectly. We’d nudge each other at funny scenes, and pause at the same time when one of us needed to go to the bathroom. I love limited-time airplane friendships!"
maybemaybemaybe,ffb852b,t1_ffb7n9w,1579754616.0,"On these flights, everyone gets to choose their own movie (unlimited movies are usually included in the ticket price) and pick when to start/pause their movie. 

It gets awkward when multiple people are watching the same movie in an enclosed area because your eye keeps getting drawn to the screens around you. Seeing the scene you just watched out of the corner of your eye is like lag IRL. Syncing up stops the distraction."

todayilearned,fe6a7gu,t3_envw3m,1578885267.0,"I live in L.A. and one of my coworkers was in this train accident. He was actually one of the people interviewed by the news and was shown repeatedly on tv. He wasn’t physically hurt too bad, but it REALLY messed him up emotionally. He’s talked about it everyday since the accident, sometimes starting conversations with new people by bringing it up. I feel terrible for the guy. He’s definitely got PTSD and can’t take public transportation at all anymore."

politics,fdwzubw,t1_fdwxupx,1578763867.0,"I agree with you. Although I think his supporters truly don’t think for themselves. Perhaps what we are seeing is a shift in how Fox News and other right wing media covered this situation. If they had enough prime time talking heads disagreeing with Trump’s decision to poke the bear with Iran, it could have made an impact."
politics,fdwsgnd,t1_fdvw0fy,1578761944.0,"It’s weird. I overheard a Trump supporter the other day in regards to the situation in Iran saying: “now I can kind of see why the left gets upset with Trump” 

I was confused why this situation would get their attention but not the HUNDREDS of other shitty things he’s done. Maybe because it involved him putting troops in imminent danger? Maybe because they get pissed when he does anything outside of America, counter to his campaign slogan?

I hope some political strategist out there is dissecting exactly why their emotions for Trump shifted here re: Iran, and can put out an ad to wake up some of his followers before November."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fdj3cyd,t1_fdj2d6h,1578457358.0,"Americans under the age of 25 don’t remember what 9/11 was like. The rest of us were terrified when it happened. It was a totally surreal experience to see an attack an American soil. I’m hoping this doesn’t continue to escalate.

Edit: age 25 *today* meaning they were 6 years old on 9/11"
politics,fdiw9x2,t1_fdidanz,1578452475.0,"So many MAGA cult members would be glued to the tv if they saw their dear leader speaking on a Super Bowl commercial. It would be the most effective just played as-is, without any snarky voiceovers or democratic names tied to it."
HofellerDocuments,fdgi6dx,t3_el93mu,1578397831.0,"Emails are posted! These are structured for an offline review, so people don't need to click through links on Google Drive. All emails deduplicated, processed into MHT files with native attachments, is reduced to only 218MB so it'll be easy for anyone to download. To review, please:

1. Download the  zip from this path: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMWb5K-wYIFZIxZCas0G4\_mOCd-Y\_IZ1/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMWb5K-wYIFZIxZCas0G4_mOCd-Y_IZ1/view?usp=sharing)
2. Uncompress it on your computer, in the same structure as in the zip
3. Open the spreadsheet to see the metadata associated with all emails and attachments. You can use this spreadsheet to filter and run searches across the metadata columns. The links in the spreadsheet will launch the emails (as MHT files, which can be opened with any web browser) and attachments as natives. Note: 28 of the email attachments were huge DBF files, so they have ""See Google Drive"" as their link descriptions instead of weighing down the whole zip.
4. If you don't want to use the spreadsheet, or if you don't have Excel, you can open the ""files"" folder and click through the documents. I named the files as follows:

Emails: <year month day\_doc ID>  
Attachments: <year month day\_family ID-doc ID>

The attachments are all native files, and have an extra long file name with the family ID in addition to the doc ID, so you'll be able to easily see them during review.

A helpful tip is to open the ""Preview"" pane in the file folder and click through the documents. You won't need to open each document, you can just click down through them in chronological order with email families kept together.

I'm working on a web-version of this for tomorrow, but wanted to get something posted ASAP for people to start digging through. The web version will have cross-references to the searches that people are asking for. 

Thanks for your patience - we'll get this right soon!"

I’m making a report now, wondering what the best way to send one-off updates will be. I’ve made a google account for this project, so I can use the suite of Sheets, Drive, etc. Any ideas are appreciated!"
