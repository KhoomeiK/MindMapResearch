pokemon,ffyjlpy,t1_ffxbujp,1580347981.0,"Nintendo as been waiting until closer to release since they started the directs, so they already have that history.  The problem is that they want players to decide between the three tiers of premium or the basic service without telling us if this is going to be all of the features like with Bank or if they will be planning on adding more stuff, kinda like Sword and Shield.  This lack of communication has harmed the community as you noted regarding Sword and Shield.

I will say that my understanding of The Pokémon Company is different from yours.  TPC and TPCi market the franchise under the orders of Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.  Given Creatures work, it is likely that true control is between Nintendo and Game Freak."

First, [Pikiell's image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Steve_Pikiell.jpg) is so blurry because the image has been extracted from [an image of C. J. Jackson](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:C._J._Jackson.jpg) for use on their Wikipedia page.  If you look through the Wikimedia Common info on Jackson's image, you will find that there is a second photo extracted from it, [this time for former Ohio State Coach, Thad Matta](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Thad_Matta_in_2017.jpg).  Indeed, this image is used on Matta's article, though buried in the Ohio State section.

At this point, you will note that Thad Matta cannot be seen in the Jackson image.  That is because that ***itself*** was extracted from [this Flickr image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alexanderjonesi/33063055930) taken by one [Alexander Jonesi](https://twitter.com/ajonesi?lang=en).  You will note on Flickr that the comments within the last week are one person asking if it could be used for Wikipedia and Jonesi allowing it by modifying the rights to the image.
