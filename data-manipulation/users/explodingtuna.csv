Kinda makes you wonder what ""canon"" really means, because if the original bible was divinely inspired, I imagine you wouldn't have the right to pick and choose what you want to believe.  So it essentially means that, as time went on, people called bullshit on more and more of the bible while others held on.

But sadly, it was probably more due to political reasons than any epistemological study determining that the omitted books weren't truly divinely inspired.  Even in the modern Protestant bibles, we know of some books added much later than Jesus' time, and for personal or political reasons. Yet we don't see a new subset of Protestantism that weeds those out."
