I know why her price is high but I'm not sure I want to spend that when someone who is the average price range (which is almost half her price) might be able to help me just the same.

All you can do is tell him how this makes you feel, ask him why he does(n't) do x,y,z and try and make him feel like he can communicate about this with you. If after your attempt(s) to communicate this issue he still doesn't communicate you have to decide whether not only not having sex (other than what you said) is a deal breaker or not AND whether his lack of communication is a deal breaker too, are you going to be okay when future, potentially worse scenarios arise and he won't communicate with you on those either?

What you (and your partner, and your grandma, and his teacher, and anyone else you haven't mentioned that is regular in his life) to explain to him about boundaries and why he shouldn't be breaking them, you may need to explain this a few times (making a social story for it will really help) and then when he starts to approach anyone, remind him of boundaries and personal space as he is approaching them, rather than once he has already broken the boundaries. (Ofcourse also remind him of the boundaries while he is breaking them) his behaviour should improve with time as long as everyone is cooperating with doing this and hopefully one day he will understand and stop breaking people's boundaries."

If you really want a man to open up to you and you're not gonna go running to the hills afterwards, you gotta show him that it's ok to struggle and be an actual human around you. My boyfriend had a huge brick wall when I first met him, and eventually he let himself take those bricks down for me, and when he cried in my arms, I didn't think he was weak, I think he is strong because it takes a strong person to let themselves be truly seen, it takes a strong man to take the risk and seek the comfort he needs. He might still have some of his wall but I know, he knows that if I ask him, and if he is struggling, I am there for him and we will get through it together."

The first part of this post is normal stuff after a break up, what confuses me though is 

>he was really shocked and shaken upon seeing me.

Shocked to see someone you weren't expecting to fair enough, but shaken? That suggests to me you were being what your post history suggest, and did something unforgivable. Either that or you're supposed to be dead and he 'saw a ghost' but I am gonna assume this isn't an irl *you* scenario 

Due to your post history I can only assume your intentions of pretending not to know who he was, was done to try and hurt him. Therefore I am going with YTA. Even if that isn't your intentions, I still keep by what I said. You could have politely told him you weren't interesting in talking to him, instead of acting like a petty child."
