politics,ffigdzb,t1_ffi4qs9,1579973238.0,I recommend listening to some of the latest episodes of The Daily podcast that are about the 2020 race. Bernie has some major obstacles that don't get a ton of media time. Unfortunately there are states that are more important because they can swing red or blue. Their issues may seem relatively small but they can be make or break. So if Bernie is promising to abolish fracking he immediately upsets union working democrats who are in western Pennsylvania. Biden is much more middle ground of a candidate. By being adamant in his views Bernie alienates a bunch of single issue voters that don't agree with him.

politics,ffglxd3,t1_ffgla6k,1579909290.0,"I honestly just don't feel like digging. But there was an interview with Schiff sometime around the end of the impeachment inquiry where he laid out in simple terms why he felt the senate was a better bet for getting key witnesses that refused to show up in the house. I feel like it was CNN and Jake Tapper, but it's Friday afternoon and I just don't care to find it. I'm on beer number 2 and about to cook dinner. But I swear I'm not just making shit up. I've been finely tuned to this as well and it's so easy to miss information. He definitely made his strategy well known in advance."

politics,ffctrr2,t3_estvix,1579807096.0,I hate the republicans as much as the next guy but damn this is such a dumb headline. They literally had schumer on moments later and asked him if these reports were true. Same with Elizabeth Warren who they had on after that. They both said that the republicans were watching and paying attention even if they weren't there. Maybe some were out of their seats but and were tweeting. But this is just a story that's been blown up to be a headline people can be outraged over.
politics,ff9i8lm,t1_ff9heze,1579713579.0,You been paying attention? The republicans don't even want to commit to the articles of impeachment to be entered as evidence.
politics,ff9g6jr,t1_ff9fdku,1579712321.0,Because the republicans have been asking for first hand witnesses to convince them of anything. It also highlights that they are making bad faith arguments when they stonewall evidence and witnesses coming forward. They are now all on record that they don't want additional information to come out.
politics,ff906sr,t1_ff8ycae,1579701476.0,Are you aware that the house is still pursuing those witnesses and that their investigation is not over? They are tied up in the courts as they said they would be. They had enough evidence to prove guilt so they didn't need to wait for further testimony.

Pretending to quit acting and making a whole fuss about it. All for some terrible fake documentary. It just came across as a cry to look at him.
movies,ff28oyq,t1_ff26swv,1579497063.0,"Dude is also one of rudest actors in Hollywood over the past 30 years. You don't treat people the way he does no matter how talented you are. I can occasionally separate the person from the performance but it's been really hard. His ego has turned me off from watching some great films.

Edit: For those that haven't seen it this is just the latest but not the only example of his rude behavior.

https://youtu.be/tbFoOwy_yPA

And this is his ""character"" that's just pulling a prank. It feels more self centered than artistic to me. He put the spotlight on himself by saying he was through with Hollywood and was gonna go on some half assed music career. I love myself some good cringe comedy but this is not enjoyable to me. I can respect the level of method acting he's going through.  I just don't have a taste for his brand of ego.

politics,fery0yd,t1_ferjtfj,1579359481.0,">How exactly does fomenting distrust in democracy and the media benefit all Americans?  I can certainly see how *Bernie* benefits personally from these campaign tactics.  

He is speaking the truth of a broken system. He is openly calling for a political revolution. Before a revolution happens in the streets it must first happen in the mind. He is opening the closed eyes to a failed government. Millions of us have felt this long before either of his presidential campaigns. 

>I’m not really sure what his campaign is doing for America or Americans.

Trying to gain free health care as a human right. Take charge on the global stage with climate change. Make sure teachers are given a livable wage right out of school. Ensuring Americans don't assume tens of thousands of dollars in debt for wanting to pursue a higher education. These are just a few of the main ones."

Pundits have been saying for weeks that this is probably a tactic to get the democratic candidate to cave into their demands for the debates. If they start off from a position where they claim not to be going then how do you think the dems would persuade him to join in? By giving him what he really wants. Fox News to host at least one of them.
