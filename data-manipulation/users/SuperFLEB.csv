Where's the money in it? Nowadays, the data's all encrypted, the phone is a brick without a passcode, and carrier blocks on stolen phones make it useless if you get past that. If anything, the SIM is probably worth more, because you can swap it into a new phone and start selling international calls until the owner shuts it off. 

About the only value I could see is parts or selling it to some other chump and running off with the money before they ever turn it on. What am I missing?

The TC team was rather secretive, though and (again, last I checked) no one had offered an explanation for the abrupt and curt retirement. 

VeraCrypt is a fork of TrueCrypt that, AFAIK, is considered the successor. If you've used VeraCrypt, you've basically used what TrueCrypt would have been. Due to some additional security measures VeraCrypt takes, I found it to be a bit slower opening volumes (from files) than TrueCrypt was. Since my uses of TrueCrypt weren't exceptionally sensitive (I used it as much for the VHD-style ""mountable file"" aspect as the intense security), I just stuck with TC, which I do personally, but wouldn't recommend."

Doubly so if you're looking for something obscure but important to you, like, say, a car stereo user-interface that doesn't suck.

(So I suppose I'll do my part and say: The car stereo user interface on the Honda Odyssey is a fucking nightmare. It's a car accident waiting to happen-- all touchscreen, and requires you to browse through music like you're casually tapping on a tablet without a care in the world, when you're careening down the road at 80 miles an hour. They try to fill the gap with ""Just use Voice Activation!"", but that's inevitably just the car shrieking at you that it couldn't make heads or tails of what you were saying, then reading off every damned album on the system, line by line, going ""Is that it?"" In fact, the user-interface overall is kind of a shit-show. In trying to be too clever, it's frustrating, unresponsive, and full of usability holes. Will it unlock? Will the dome light stay on? Will the stereo shut off in the middle of copying files? It's got an algorithm, but I'll be damned if I know what it is.

The car stereo user interface on the Scion xD was a bit better, though its stereo has other notable problems, like the fact that it can't take over 99 folders on a flash drive, and it sorts files by when you put them on.

And whatever self-important fuckwit decided you could only tap three times in Android Auto also needs to be caught crossing the road while I'm fumbling with it. The solution to a poor system is not to just throw up your hands and disable it.)"
