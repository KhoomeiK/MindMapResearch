facepalm,fetxg7l,t1_fetu8w7,1579381041.0,"Because like everything it evolved. They heard something that made more sense to them so started following that, which scared the leaders because if people start believing that instead they have no power. Back then you kill the people that speak out against you for fear of losing your power. Have you never heard the expression ""a double edged sword""? Religion is a powerful tool but it can be your downfall if the people start not believing you were chosen by the God they now believe in. Which again, is why you kill people teaching something different to you. Control information and you control the people."
facepalm,fetsc6k,t1_fetqpyh,1579379466.0,"I didn't say religion is controlling. I said religion is used to control the mass. And again, the disciples weren't part of the ruling class, they were the mass (I dont know what part of that you aren't getting). They were just following an offshoot that their community leaders didn't want them to, which is why they were killed."
facepalm,feto2me,t1_fetk1k1,1579377455.0,"Well thats if you understood what I meant. The martyrs are members the mass, not the ruling class. Christianity began as an offshoot of Judaism which was the lead religion at the time in that region. The Roman overlords let them continue their worship while they also had their own gods. So the Romans just ""gave in"" to the Jewish leaders ""demands"" to kill these upstarts. The Jewish leaders saw them as a threat to their control, and the Romans who controlled these leaders in turn also controlled the mass."
facepalm,feti9rc,t1_fetbglo,1579375703.0,"The fact they died for a religious belief shows that they were deceived seeing as religion is mainly a way of controlling a population. That's why you have those ""believe in me or burn in hell"" verses. Why would a God be so vain to the point that it requires everyone to believe in it to the point it cracks a hissy fit and throws them in jail for all eternity? Unless of course it isn't vain and that's just a way of getting everyone under the same thumb."

facepalm,fem2eyt,t1_felzzz8,1579237524.0,"Yeah. And there are alot of people who are deathly allergic to it. It can also be transferred via milk if say the cow was given it. This is why there are those no milking periods which is costly, and vat tests which can make is so gosh darn inconvenient and expensive. 2 things a business would happily be rid of if there wasn't a government looking out for the best interests of its people by regulating the industry. 

Libertarianism is a fairy tail. You don't trust a government intervention because people can't be trusted, so what makes this system any different. You can't trust people to be in your best interest unless there is some sort of regulation holding them to that. That is the reason for regulation. 

People can't really choose where they live because of a thing called affordability. If one area is the winner of this liveability war then it becomes more expensive to live there just because of supply and demand (more people want to live there), kicking the poorer people out for the wealthier. The poor can then only afford the rough spots which 1, are already poorly maintained and 2, can't improve beyond that because they don't have the funds because of poor clients. This is essentially the same system but with tax the poor areas would have a larger budget to play with. 

Say you are in Area A. Area B has a bridge that needs repairing but doesn't have the funds. A needs that bridge for logistical reasons. So I'm guessing they will help by forking over the money to repair the bridge. This is the same as what tax is except the funds are pooled into one and then distributed based on budgetary requirements to individual councils. They know that A is nowhere near B but residents of A would still required things in B to be maintained, as well as Area C, D, E, and F."
facepalm,felzt3c,t1_felyvl0,1579235261.0,"Must be why all those small breweries are going out of business and why only only see the main brands on the shelf. Lol there are hundreds of small producers making money. That argument is moronic. 

What bureaucracy? The ones that make sure the consumer isn't having milk with penicillin still in its system causing deadly allurgic reactions so that a company can save a buck on not disposing of a bad batch?

Also small farmers generally have contracts with the big corporations. Big corporations are notorious for not spending money where they don't see a benefit. A rough road for example is not on their radar.

That system of yours is no less voluntary than taxation. The only difference is that it's local so money doesn't go to other areas that need everyone to pitch in. We all use things that don't come from the town we live in."
facepalm,fely090,t1_felx24b,1579233805.0,"I dont see the difference? You still pay someone to take responsibility for sorting out infrastructure. And they are still obliged to spend that money in a way to try benefits everyone. What happens if a person doesn't pay their way in those small hubs? Are they forced out? Is it really voluntary in that case. Also what about areas of low population, like farming areas. How do they maintain their very important infrastructure without everyone forking over a bit to help. Meat and veg doesn't come from the store down the street."
