magicTCG,ffhafhb,t1_ffh0sd2,1579927857.0,He had two food tokens that he could have turned to elks. So how do you know this is cheating (i.e. intentional) and not just a brain fart after having played two days of intensive Magic at the professional level?
magicTCG,ffha77u,t1_ffh84pt,1579927649.0,"How is it WotC's fault? Players always have the right to shuffle, but in this case the opponent didn't even perform a cut. Not only that, but in Competitive and higher REL, shuffling is required, but many players simply do a cut. If there is one criticism you could levy at Wizards, it's that the shuffling rule is not enforced."
magicTCG,ffha3s5,t1_ffg78wv,1579927561.0,Card Kingdom has done exactly that: https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/etecty/reminder_always_shufflecut_your_opponents_library/ffghevz/
magicTCG,ffha27s,t1_ffgcfpm,1579927522.0,"How are the rules lax for cheating? It's an immediate DQ, followed by a report to the investigating committee, which usually results in a suspension."
magicTCG,ffh9z25,t1_ffghevz,1579927441.0,Thank you for the update. This is a great.

DesignPorn,fffs9ow,t1_fffr3nt,1579890692.0,I'm not here to judge anyone individually. I just noticed there was a pattern of this type of comment.
