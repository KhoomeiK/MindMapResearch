chess,fen7elz,t1_fen2s3p,1579278605.0,"Started in a chess club when I was 12. I was more interested in computer games, so I stayed at the lowest rating for a year. I learned the classical knowledge about center control, develop pieces, pawn structure.

Then I learned there were other kids who played chess(!), especially this annoying idiot 3 years younger who played bad moves fast and won. I set myself a goal: To beat this kid. It was before high school, so my day pretty much looked like 8 hours sleep, 8 hours school, 8 hours chess. Not surprisingly, that gave results. All of a sudden, I got 1900 elo.

As for tips, my first one is to like the game, and find a few friends who also plays chess around the same level as you. Then you will all improve together, and compete against each other. Second tip is to play more tournaments. At least 1 tournament per month, but I have a friend who plays like 35 tournaments a year. That is crazy, but he became very good by simply playing against (strong) players all the time.

And my last tip is study. Read books, solve exercises, ask questions. There are infinite amount of good books out there, but most people ask for good books, and rarely reads them. The yusupov series from Quality Chess is very good, Jeremy Silman is basic, but a good introduction to systematic thinking. To become good at chess you need to know an insane amount of knowledge, and the only way to get there is start somewhere. I really don't believe that any specific book can have a special status, but a sure way not to learn is to not read anything. I recently lost a lot of rating points, and when I began asking why, I found out it was around ½ year after starting studying on university, so I think real progress (and the opposite) happens after around ½ year of training (and not training).

And the best training for a specific tournament is just do tactics every day up to the tournament for 30 minutes. Be in shape!

chess,fed0xy6,t3_eoircz,1578993167.0,"Yes. It is slightly easier to set, the DGT 3000-clock is more complex in that sense. That is obviously mostly a problem in the start, it is not a big problem.

The DGT 3000 shows the seconds ticking all the time, while the 2010-clocks only shows seconds when you have less than 20 minutes. I thought that was really annoying in the start, but that was only because I was used to the old clocks. After a tournament with DGT 3000, I felt it was annoying not knowing how many seconds I had left of the minute, even though it was not at all important information when you have 1 hour and 25 minutes AND 36 seconds.

The ""big"" advantage with DGT 3000 is that you can have 4 custom time controls. So if you like playing 5+3, 1+1 and 2+3 weird time controls, you can have them preset in that clock. In DGT 2010, you can have one custom time control in every ""settign"", for example you can have 1 custom in Fischer (extra time each move), bronstein (delay) and normal (no time added). 

All in all pretty equal, but I value it very high that it takes 0.5 seconds to set the DGT 2010."

3... Nf6 is a good move, though. If white goes 4. Ng5, it is probably better to play the d5-lines or the Traxler. In those positions, it is black who sacrifices material to get some counterplay.

chess,fds2er3,t1_fdr4d2h,1578693267.0,"That is fine, but my point is that not studying openings can have a negative impact on your game. Untill recently I had never studied 1. d4 for white in my life, since I played e4 in the beginning, and my coach was also an e4-player. This meant that even though I am a decent player, I have very little experience with for example passed d-pawns in the Grunfeld, closed KID-positions and standard minority attacks. Those who only play very narrow openings with very few structures have even bigger problems, and I doubt I would have ever passed 2000 in rating had I not forced myself to play sharp openings, because I am a ""positional"" player, meaning my main weakness is dynamics."
chess,fdr3g0p,t3_emrfo3,1578678955.0,"I want to improve and I hate opening study

When I was smaller, around 1100-2100, I really liked openings. I made a great repertoire, quite deep for my level, but it pushed me. Even though I was a positional player, I forced myself to play the open sicilian, because I wanted to know what happens. More often than I would like I would end in the local chess news for best game - on the wrong side. Castling queenside and playing positional was a bad combo, so I was essential forced to do more study and become better at the initiative.

Opening study is an important part of improvement, since when you learn a new opening, you are forced to learn to play new types of positions. If you play the london system for many years, you get a lot of similiar positions, which means that you don't need to improve your general understanding, which means that you don't improve as quickly or at all.

Yes opening study requires time, and should not stand alone. But to improve, you need to spend time and energy to learn new things. That is what improvement is. Now I really hate opening study, so most of my time is going into learning new positional concepts, structures and calculation. Which I guess is fine, but I can feel I'm a bit annoyed when 2000-players prepare something specific, and I'm not too dynamical in my opening choices. Then I need to outplay them from an equal position, instead of crushing them. Or I need to hold a worse position against a strong player.

As for what opening is easiest, they are essential the same. I feel 1. e4 is much easier to play than 1. d4, probably because I have played 1. e4 for most of my ""career"". You can easily make an e4-repertoire with just a few structures to learn, but what is the point? Don't you want to improve?"

chess,fdmprx2,t1_fdiexnk,1578559784.0,"Nice metaphor. And system openings are for people who insist fighting from the forest, even though their opponent might choose the mountains equipped with fire arrows, out of range from the forest, but burning it all down.

Well, understanding of the moves you play is more important than the specific moves is always true. You see it happen when Carlsen beats a 2600 in a quiet opening, where it looks like the 2600 GM has no idea what he is doing. However, the better you get the more important move orders and specific counterplans, which is called ""memorising openings"".

This is because on lower levels, it is important that you let your whole army fight together. If the fight is inside the forest, no reason to put half of it on sea. The better you get, the more important it is to realise: ""We fight from a forest, maybe fire arrows is a bad idea"", ""we are in a mountain, if the opponent takes the obvious route we can just throw stones at him.""

I am terrible at go, but I would expect there are a million of different setups in each different area, and the subtle points are how each setup interact with the whole board (I set these stones in section 1 so I lose by a little, but I do not spend so many stones.

chess,fdjo0e0,t3_eljef2,1578480223.0,"As a chess coach in a club, I play a lot of kids, usually with time odds, and I can basically win on demand no matter the time. But I try to make sure to lose if the kid needs confidence (for example if they get a bye in the last round after having lost all rounds) or if they play unusually well I sometimes lose by playing suboptimal moves untill it is unsaveable. This way, they feel extremely happy when they win, and usually run around and tell everyone who wants to listen, because it happens so rarely. It will happen for each kid every 2-3 months, depending on how much they want to play against me.

For a 6-year old, the most important thing is that they have fun. If that means beating daddy, I would suggest playing so that the game is interesting (so the kid is always sligthly ahead, or makes a comeback because you hung a rook), and make sure they win at least half of the games. Still losing some, so they learn to tackle that. I don't have kids though, so I have no practical experience in that."
chess,fda5u6n,t3_ekf06m,1578242109.0,"Manage time: Against a tough opponent (equal or better), it is very common to have spend half of your time by move 20. That seems to be the meta at least at my level, if you have a position where thinking on more or less every move is required. Also, you can compare your time with your opponents. I usually think it is important to stay within half an hour of my opponents time, especially when you are the one who is low on time. Playing fast to win on time is, of course, usually a bad idea. Spend your time blunder-checking.

I take plenty of breaks, but I noticed I do much better if I just stay at the board. But keeping concentration is important, so take a break if you feel tired and not concentrating. Bring water, I usually bring ½ liter. In the beginning, I drank 2 liters of water during a game, and went to the toilet all the time. Now I drink 1/4 liter, and feel hydrated. Don't bring carrots, it is not necessary to bring snacks, but I have seen plenty grandmasters bringing a banana. I don't do it, because I just forget to eat. 

Have fun and set some goals. I was very proud the first time I spent more than an hour, and the first time I went into ""time trouble"". It shows time management skills. If you play too fast, it is usually something you can change during the tournament. If you play too slow, it is more tough."
