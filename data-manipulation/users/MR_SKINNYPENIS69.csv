No sane person will have an issue with that unless they're trying to cheat. If they want to leave, better off without them. I know that's unrealistic when it's hard to find players and so I understand the reluctance to confront the issue, but that's just how I feel about it. I can't stand cheaters. It's not that they're cheating, it's that they're devaluing everyone else's time by playing with an advantage while honest players suffer all just because they're too childish and selfish to play fair. I played poker once a week at this bar, but I fazed out after a while. I found out recently that one of the players had been caught with a 2nd deck they'd been using to give themself better hands. It's not the fact they were cheating us out of our money (which wasn't even a large amount, the buy in was basically the price of a beer), it's the gall and principle of the thing that really got to me.
