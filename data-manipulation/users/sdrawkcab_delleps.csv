worldnews,ffleq1z,t1_ffkpzsj,1580038758.0,"This happened to a girl from my City. She went to a techno nightclub with some friends and somehow felt a weird itching feeling on her arm. 
Long story short
Some motherfucker stuck a needle in her arm which had ""Now you have it too"" in German written on it. She immediately got herself checked and turned out to be HIV positive...
The guy who did it had to pay 10k € personal injury compensation and that's it. Sounds like something straight outta Hollywood.
People like that should end up in a fucking asylum imo.
Sorry for possible grammar mistakes"

Judging by the people I've come across, 90% of the children born after 2002 are fucking morons, because technology took control over them way to early."

gtaonline,ff2dn9g,t1_ff1x22t,1579501881.0,"When there's only one guy closing the application, he's running a high risk of failing the challenge. 
As far as I know, everybody has to close their application, because if only the guy who died did it, he'd be on a different level of progress. 
You could still finish the challenge, but only 3 out of 4 people would get the money.
I kinda had a hard time explaining this cause I couldn't find the right words, I hope you understand what I'm trying to say"

We were aware that this method could harm our consoles, but it didn't and we completed the challenge, even though we've died about 4 times in the process.

Sounds like some actual good advice, especially if you're about as tall as me. 
Most of my friends who work out, are in the  5'5"" - 6"" range, so for them gaining muscle and weight in general, is a whole different story. As you already said.
Your comment is exactly what I was looking for when I made this post."
