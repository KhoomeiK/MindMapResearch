What you're seeing today is the result of decades long struggles by women, minorities, and their allies. No switch was flipped in society. It was a gradual change.

Look at the typical woman's life in the 1920s vs the 2020s. They are vastly different, and that's because of an incredible amount of groundwork by rights groups, women protestors, etc.

If you folks want that same consideration, that's fine, but you don't get it by going ""waaaaa womens day wwaaaaa"". You folks need to put in the legwork to get society to accept those problems and treat them at the same level it does others.

Crying about other folks having their problems addressed does not help your cause at all. Get out there. Form protest groups. Stage talks. Get the message out. Rally others. Get society to see the problems you see.

Bitching that women's day gets some nod from Amazon while men's day doesn't serves absolutely no purpose other than to go ""waaaaa women get something waaaa"". It also gets you and your cause mocked as a bunch of crybabies."

I never understood this argument. It's not like all of the women's shit just came into existence one night. People fought for it. They protested for recognition constantly. People got public recognition for it. This prompted the cultural change. You're seeing the result of decades long struggles with actual work being put in.

If you folks want the men days to be the same, you have to put in the legwork. Going ""waaaaaa women get more recognition on a specific day than men do"" isn't going to cut it."
