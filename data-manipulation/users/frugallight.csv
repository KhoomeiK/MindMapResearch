I tried to enable apps or put my phone in my bag and out of reach, same with sweets. But I always find a way around and still grab my phone or the sweets."
getdisciplined,fenh9zg,t1_fenarqe,1579284659.0,"This doesn't seem to work for me. I still procrastinate and then still go, because ofc I don't want them to wait. Sometimes I am even looking forward meeting with a 3rd party or another ""date"" that would give me an excuse to further postpone / quit what I should be doing. :("
getdisciplined,fenh30y,t1_fen9jmr,1579284542.0,"You're welcome! 

Though I have to admit, I wrote this post while avoiding work. lol"
getdisciplined,fengo78,t1_fen6quj,1579284289.0,"That is so very true! For example, checking my mobile happens very automatic. I think my brain gets bored or faces some kind of obstacle, and then it goes ""let's check that mobile game, that is so much fun and entertaining."" ... But after a whole day, I feel very bad and like I failed.

The short-term ""fun"" seems to be rewarding, but it isn't in the long run. The snacking all the time doesn't really fullfill me. Just for one moment. and then I need more. And after the working day is done, I feel fat and still hungry.

Do you have any tips, links or whatever on how to train your brain from short-term impulses to longer-term rewards?

Edit: I know you wrote, that by paying attention on what I am doing, that it is rewarding for the brain. But oftentimes it is not or I don't even get to this point (not sure which is true). The brain goes immediately into  something short-term stimulating like ""let's check the phone"" or ""let's quickly beat another level in Candy Crush""..."
getdisciplined,feng5e4,t1_fen1j2i,1579283967.0,"I think that is a good strategy to become more aware of the avoidance. And to know that I will feel better after tackling it. I will give it a try. 

And it really does make me uncomfortable and unhappy. I feel crappy when I go home after a day of mostly avoiding work. Whereas on productive days, I feel much better."
getdisciplined,fenftsi,t1_fend581,1579283775.0,"Thanks, I will look that up!"
getdisciplined,fenft5b,t1_fen1cg8,1579283763.0,"Since some weeks I meditate every morning for about 10 minutes. I think it helps a bit, but more in terms of not letting things get to me. So far I don't notice a big difference for focusing or getting things started."
getdisciplined,fenfn02,t1_fen0qp5,1579283657.0,"Sitting in a mostly empty office, I feel you! 

Avoiding the actual work makes me feel very unsatisfied, but it's sooo incredible difficult for me to get started... 

I will def try the pomodoro technique. Thanks! 

Sometimes I start scribbling on a piece of paper. But to write down the scattered thoughts is even better. I will try that too. Maybe this brings some clarity or inspiration."
Advice,fek55h1,t1_fek4waj,1579192823.0,I am although thinking about getting an apartment and renting a room out. But then again I have a roommate. Not much difference to now? But maybe it's easier with only one?
relationship_advice,fdqpq8o,t1_fdqnel5,1578672222.0,"Thing is, if I bring it up openly, the will be a lot of conflict and he will be in a bad mood for weeks. It's like this any time, I bring something up that he thinks is a critique.

I thought that maybe somebody on Reddit has a clever idea to stop the freeloading and him inviting himself into invitations to my friends without causing conflict. I just dont have the energy for it"
relationship_advice,fdqowqd,t1_fdqnsz1,1578671708.0,"Wow, your roommates... I think I would cry or scream after putting so much effort in preparing everything in advance.

He rarely eats or drinks my stuff, when I am not around. At least not that I noticed. But he expects that I share when I have a drink or when I have friends over. But he rarely returns that as he had never friends over. Dude, just go buy yourself your own wine for once!  

I would mind less if he was considerate with cleanliness and shopping shared stuff. But he isn't and I feel like being taking advantage of."
relationship_advice,fdqoiyb,t1_fdqo1il,1578671468.0,"It's just very difficult to have a normal, adult conversation. He flips and feels attacked and is in a bad mood for two weeks, even when I bring ut up in a friendly way. That's why I don't want to discuss with him at all. Since some weeks I just have stuff in my room instead of letting it sit in the kitchen. I sm even considering bringing new pans into my room, bc he is scratching and ruining them. It feels stupid and petty, but I dont know how to help myself as he isn't going to change. 
So maybe this is also a half solution for it. I pour myself a glass when he isnt around or in my room?!"
relationship_advice,fdqnxro,t1_fdqnn1e,1578671099.0,In order to be a decent human being and tp give back?!
relationship_advice,fdqntgo,t1_fdqncs7,1578671023.0,"I stash it away, so he doesn't help himself to it. 

But I can't avoid it in some situations like having friends over. Or when I pour myself a Whiskey after work or a red wine... I was looking for ideas on how to deal with these situations. 

And yeah, I am already looking for other flats."
relationship_advice,fdqmte1,t1_fdqmjuy,1578670387.0,"Yeah... thought it makes me a bit petty. 

I wish I could invite friends and he doesn't invite himself. ;) 

Guess I wouldn't mind so much, if he would return the favor. He drinks my drinks, even if he has alcohol himself. Wouldn't it be normal that he offers his stuff too or at least drinks his own stuff?"
Anticonsumption,f9jfw0z,t3_e54nxe,1575372419.0,Love it! Such a great idea!!
