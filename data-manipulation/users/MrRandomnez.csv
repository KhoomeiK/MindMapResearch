With a large enough territory, they will eventually populate the land available to them and begin to encroach on populated areas."
Naturewasmetal,feihzm9,t1_fei1r23,1579138972.0,"As well as Botswana, there is currently a huge elephant overpopulation in the Kruger National Park in South Africa. They are no lo ger allowed to cull small herds so the elephants are starting to decimate ecosystems within the confines of the park. I imagine introducing them to a small niche in another country would eventually result in similar predicaments without extensive control."

When she was an EMT she saw a man die after he fell forwards onto an ice cream stick that penetrated his brain. Your fear of falling onto a toothbrush and choking is just as irrational. Just reminding the poor kid of the story every time he performs the action cements the idea in his brain that not only is accidental death likely, it will probably happen to him. The woman who did this to her son was literally a surgeon, so don't just blindly trust doctors."
