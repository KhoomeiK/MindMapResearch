There’s no reason a person couldn’t drive themselves while microdosing or take it at home and go about their day as normal. In super small doses, there is no impairment as far as the hallucination side of the drugs. No worse than the common side effects of pharmaceutical SSRI’s that are currently pushed in to everyone. 

You should check out r/microdosing for more insight on how it works!"

antiwork,ffid6uh,t1_ffibe9c,1579971068.0,"I agree with you, here. I haven’t bought anything from amazon myself since 2013. I know it makes little to no impact since there are so many more than lil ol’ me who continue to shop through amazon. 

One thing I will counter on is consumers being cheapskates- I feel consumers are trapped into buying cheap products that break easily for the least amount we can get by with because of the nature of capitalism. If we weren’t slaves to money and capitalism, and if we had more social supports in place, we could spend more wisely on things that last and could give more value to well-crafted items. If people weren’t so worried about how they’re going to pay for their health and basic needs, I feel they would be more thoughtful about their purchases overall, basically."

MurderedByWords,fff152e,t1_ffezusq,1579872814.0,Seems like r/aboringdystopia you’re living in there. Have fun not living life while you still have time.
MurderedByWords,ffdyytr,t1_ffdt3cm,1579832426.0,"I’m not the person you’re asking, but my cats are rescued strays. Sometimes we don’t seek out pets, they choose us.  

It’s like asking “Why have friends if you cannot afford the financial burden they can bring?”/“Why have children if you cannot afford the financial burden they are?” 

Because love and compassion and the desire for companionship is human nature + the random throes of life, that’s why."

What makes you the most proud to work at this company?

In what ways does the company reward and recognize success of “teammates”? (Feel free time insert the appropriate lingo for wage slave here according to the company’s preferred lingo.)

How does the company support professional growth in its employees?

What was the company’s biggest challenge last year and what did you learn from it?

How do you address failures here?

Does the company promote work-life balance here? In what ways?"

Better yet, make it in a meme format. Unfortunately this world has been trained to direct their eyes toward sensationalism, quick and easy to read pictures and adverts. 

I think a post that is like a cliff notes version of any one book would also be worth a try. 

Thank you for sharing, I’ll be looking into this list!"

I work in a medical office and I have paid on more than one patient account from my own pocket because of their individual situation pulling on my heart strings (one was a veteran and the other was dealing with death of a loved one and both were in financial troubles).
