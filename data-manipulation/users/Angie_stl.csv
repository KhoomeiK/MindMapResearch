dogs,fevzbh7,t3_eqohkm,1579403371.0,"I had a beagle, Dandelion, that ate her weight in shoes. At least. This was late 90’s and I had several pairs of $50 shoes, I just wanted to cry when I found my green suede Puma indoor soccer shoes had become backless. But she really only ate shoes and probably lead paint chips. 

My dachshund-papillon mix, Nova, has much more varied tastes. She started with the normal stuff, shoelaces and flip flops (ugh! Why always with my favorite shoes??), but she VERY quickly picked up new tastes. If it’s made from any type plant, she seemed to want to chew on it. Socks, paper towels, tissues, TP, regular paper. Sigh. She’s decided recently that underwear seems yummy. Then there’s salad, like regular people salad, and grass from all over the yard. She even goes after mulch, big chunks that she only halfway chews up, she has to hurry and swallow it before someone takes it away!! (This is her theory for most things.) Once my dad and I were pretty convinced she grabbed a 2 inch screw that he dropped but we just didn’t get to fast enough. There was never any issues, so either she passed it and I didn’t find it or it fell deeper in the grass than we thought. But her way to the win: she tore up the vinyl flooring from my kitchen and ate as much as she could get down before I could grab it from her. I don’t have like a square footage on how much she ate, but it was quite a bit. She has had some bloody poop before, but strangely at different times than when she’d eaten something crazy, at least as far as I know. Oh and of course, she can’t handle if an uninvited animal poops in her yard, so she eats it so that it won’t be someone else’s poop anymore. Then she tries to lick me. I keep telling her until she starts using listerine, she’s not supposed to lick, but it’s like all the things she eats, she just won’t listen when I tell her what’s best for her!! Sheesh!!

If she has to have pills, she does get at least half a slice then, I’ve tried every other way to get them down her and she eats around the pill and spits it out. With the cheese, she goes so fast, she doesn’t notice that it has a pill in it. 

I will look at the Royal Canin (yes?) because the bag of food I have now is so old that I can’t imagine her wanting to eat it.

It looks like it really is walking across OP’s face, which is amazing and terrifying all at once. I must say, I feel terrible for OP’s girlfriend, since he stated she hates spiders. Maybe she can stay on his left side for the rest of their relationship, at least when the spider isn’t covered in hair!"

AmItheAsshole,fctojjg,t1_fctjyyj,1577951596.0,"My sister in law is a self professed mama bear, and while she does exhibit the behavior you described, she takes it to the next step by treating her kids like crap unless someone is treating her kids either much better or much worse than she does. Normally she mostly ignores them, and has for most their lives as far as I’ve heard. But if one is sick and she doesn’t feel the doctor is doing a perfect job, she’s gonna go all mama bear! And one daughter got engaged, but because she wasn’t invited to when he asked, she ran after him when they left a restaurant and told him “I pray to God every day that you never marry my daughter!!” Even though he’s the best thing that’s ever happened to her daughter. (He and I have a contest to see who can spend the LEAST amount of time with mama bear this year!) These crazies come in every flavor and every background. And they’d be the first to point out another parent’s shortcomings! (Personally I have no kids.)

But OP is NTA. If her dog would have hurt the child, then it could have been all kinds of legal troubles for her. Better to be cursed out by some random hag than have a child with no manners hurt."

He was 18 or 19 when I lost him. And I absolutely can NOT get this dog to learn to purr!! I’ve tried! Snores are the best I get!"

I have spent way too much time on the various time sucking social media platforms and I commend you for staying away!! Even my 70+ year old parents are addicted to Facebook. I only get on it to connect directly with people now, for the most part, but I do still get sucked it. 

OP tell this friend to time herself for a week on her social media and then imagine what else she could have been doing!!"

She STARES at the neighbors from the time she sees their vehicles until they get out, at which time she starts barking!! Even the one that’s too far away to hear her bark, she barks at. We live in the country, so it’s the three houses on our property and three houses across the road. Happy barks on this side, not so happy on the other side. And heaven forbid someone, human or dog, walk past our house!! Goodness!! She’s 22 pounds of terror at that point!"

I hope you were able to get some rest, though I wouldn’t have been able to. You’re being much more mature about the issue than I would be, and I’m practically triple your age! So way to go on that! Since you already have a therapist, if it’s something that is very bothersome to you, you may ask the therapist about bringing your parents in for a session or two, or parts of a couple, to properly express how this is getting to you. I wish you luck for the rest of your trip!

I have seen those, and you are right, they would do if you run out of disposables or if you are environmentally conscious and have some patience. They do look a million times easier than the kind my parents used when I was a baby in the 70’s!"
AmItheAsshole,fc9vovm,t1_fc9ne1c,1577558896.0,"With the kids having Switches, they totally should be able to play without screaming too much. Plus OP said that they were asked to stay downstairs, but were upstairs making noise, which is when they got in trouble. I do agree 100% that the parents should be shouldering a good part of the responsibility, both for the behavior and the punishment. Just backing OP’s punishment up shouldn’t be enough, they should be telling the kids off themselves (OP was thanked for telling the kids to quiet down?? Seriously, get your kids under control!)!! Lastly, where are grandma and grandpa in all this? Because didn’t OP say they were staying at the in-laws? They have no opinion? That would be a first in my experience, every grandparent I’ve ever met has had MANY ideas about how the grandkids should be raised, to the very last detail.

Especially if she’s throwing her own shower. I’ve had many mothers tell me that no matter what, you can never have enough diapers!! So if I can’t find anything else, or anything I can afford, on their registry, I’ll buy a couple boxes of diapers. Maybe one in newborn and the second in size two, or whatever. I don’t have kids but I’ve babysat some rotten ones that try to see how many diapers they can get me to change in a certain amount of time!! They always win that challenge."

It’s not like OP is selling the bracelet to buy a new clock. THAT would be too much. What if the younger sister wanted to show off her clock to her friends when school started back up? If she can’t show off her clock because of big sis, big sis shouldn’t be able to show off her bracelet."
