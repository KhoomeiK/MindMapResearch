AskReddit,fdxqiac,t1_fdrxu0w,1578771835.0,"When I was a toddler my mom dated a guy for a few years she broke up with him because he was not taking care of his mental illnesses and they were making hers worse. He told her he understood and they could still be friends. So when she had to have a massive surgery in the state he lived in ( that is where the surgeon worked) he offered to let her stay with him and help her with meds and stuff. The day after her surgery while she was in pain and drugged up, he kicked her out because he got mad they were not dating anymore, she had to drive 3 hours home while drugged in a snow storm...

5 years later she ran into him again and for the love of life Idk why they started dating again. He assured her he work on mental health and what not. After dating a while he made a lovely proposal, and a little latter they had a small weddin ( literally the captain, stad, mom, and I)  and thus started her marriage. It took 9 years of marriage with him still having the same issues and causing the same problems for her to leave him. The final straw was when she was hospitalized for mental break and suicidal ideation and when she got out the Dr told him to be with her 24/7. I wanted to stay with her but both he and she assured me it would be fine and I already planned on visiting a family memeber with cancer in another state. He left her after 2 days to play a music gig near his place and did not come back. I came home to her having been abandoned for 2days and one night. She still took a year after that to divorce him and is currently in the process. For which I am so grateful to get him out of our lives."
