She gets a folded blanket on the floor that can be washed easily and replaced, we've taken out all rugs and carpeting in the house and absolutely not allowed on the furniture.

I'm in Canada and when I give birth to the baby I'm carrying I can demand that it's mine and take it home, legally nobody can stop me despite the DNA of the baby being my sister and her husband's, not mine at all. We've signed a 47 page agreement beforehand saying I wouldn't do that but it's actually not even enforceable. The best they can do is take me to court and show a judge that I had said I wouldn't do that, and hope he agrees with them. (I wouldn't do any of that, I'm a happy aunt.)

AskReddit,ffe0mpg,t1_ffckkcm,1579833629.0,"Sooo this is happening to me currently. I'm my sister's surrogate and they put one frozen-thawed day 5 embryo in on Dec 10. I had my 8 week ultrasound last Friday, the tech didn't show me the screen until the end and I saw a blob with a heartbeat, great. My doctor called me on Tuesday to say there was actually a second sac that measured smaller but they couldn't see anything in it. Apparently the one embryo split into twins but one probably didn't survive, I go for another ultrasound on Tuesday to confirm it. The surviving fetus is supposed to just absorb it. However it is possible that they just couldn't see it correctly and it won't actually vanish. I've had two pregnancies of my own kids that were very simple. I hate the not knowing... on one hand I don't think any of us are prepared for twins. On the other, it's hard not to cheer for the survival of a possible baby."

Her triggers could be the smallest insignificant thing, and the ADHD and anxiety medicine helps but isn't foolproof. We've had to take her to the ER, we're on waiting lists for a clinician... when I called the mental health help line because I'm trying my damned best for my kid do you know what the lady said to me?  ""Well you most have done something, kids don't just turn like that.""  We have two kids raised exactly the same in a home with two loving parents who spend all sorts of time with them, a mix of reasonable responsibilities and fun... but one kid just was unlucky to get the mental health issues that run in her dad's side of the family. It makes me really sad when people speculate on what the parents MUST have done wrong, sometimes you can do everything possible and it just doesn't work out."

LifeProTips,fdci3io,t1_fdcemje,1578275453.0,"Us too. My sister was getting married in Hawaii and we flew from Canada to Maui with a stopover in Chicago. Except my then 4 year old daughter's luggage took an unexpected detour to New Jersey. Luckily we had the bridal party outfits in a different one, and the carry-on had a bathing suit and clothes for 1 day. We had to grab her a few outfits from Target until the luggage got there a few days later.

The next time we went away we cross-packed, but it's stressful to have everything seem so disorganized when you get there and have to sort out which clothes belong to who."

The adoption fee covers spaying/neutering and vaccines at half the price the vet charges, if you can't afford it then you can't afford a 'free' kitten."

Board games with my husband and two kids?  Awful. In most cases siblings do not get along well in any sort of competition involved with each other, plus one of ours has ADHD + ODD and it's a recipe for torture. Yes we play them anyway, but you're worn out as hell after."

All of my daycare kids threw up the week before Christmas because one parent sent their sick kid.

A woman messaged me in the fall and said her daughter is home for the week after exams and was super stressed, so could she come over for an hour and hang out in the kitten room?

aww,fc0larw,t1_fbyrbue,1577293620.0,"I run adoptions for a rescue. The idea that animals should never be gifts and that adoptions should be blocked for the month of December has stopped a lot of cats and dogs who need homes from getting one. A responsible rescue asks the right questions before adopting to make sure that the entire household is on board and prepared to take care of the animal for its entire life. We had several kittens go home as ""Christmas presents"" who are with families who have thought this through, and are overjoyed with their new family members. And as we do any time of the year, if an adoption doesn't work out for any reason the rescue takes the kitten back to find the right home, no (external) judgement. 

It's the people who posted this month on Facebook asking for ""free kittens"" for their kids that I have issue with. There's no such thing as a free kitten."
