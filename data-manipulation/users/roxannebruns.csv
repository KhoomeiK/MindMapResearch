timberwolves,ffn6ztq,t3_eu8ul8,1580062625.0,"Yup, the start this year was foretelling.  The wolves prepared a bit in the offseason but then other teams quickly leapfrogged. Unfortunately this season punctuates poor leadership from KAT on up in a small/medium market, simply an extension of an abysmal 30-year .397 franchise.  Unfortunately I don’t see any substantial potential to improve unless major structural changes are made, Wiggins, KAT, Saunders included."

I posted my experience (and the email) on this sub but the mods deleted it.  Called Microsoft and despite email in hand - they would only reimburse 1 of 2 months. Boooo.
