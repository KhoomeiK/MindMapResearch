You can’t ignore his last wishes, as you said it is sneaky and dishonest and what YOU want. Plus that’s a perfect recipe for ghosts! Try to talk about it again in a month, ask him to be open to what YOU think and how YOU feel about this and come to a compromise that works. 

My moms wants to have us all cremated and kept together until the last of us dies (there’s 4 of us) and then our ashes spread. I don’t want to be kept after I die cause fuck this. I compromised with her that I will only allow a small amount of my ashes kept until then. The rest are to be spread right after I die. We all win."

Even if you were ok with it at the beginning, you still asked him to STOP and he didn’t. He assaulted you and raped you and is placing the blame on you. Do not let him harm you more than he already has. Find help from a group or shelter first. Get your thoughts together and seek legal advice before filing a report, but you should get a rape kit done just in case. 
Leave him. I wish you the best."

relationship_advice,fdmi9mi,t3_em08o5,1578550871.0,"You should also seek professional help from a therapist or a group that has dealt with things like these. We here on the internet can only do so much to give you encouraging words and try to point you in the right direction. 

Your feelings are valid because you are also going through it right now. You don’t need to have it all together or figured out, or feel like you HAVE to be strong for both of them. Acknowledge you’re not ok, but you are trying and this is a start. Take it one day at a time. Whatever will come in the future, will come but try to be present now. 

You need emotional support too and you can’t do it alone. Asking for help from local groups and therapists is a start. 

Best of luck <3"
