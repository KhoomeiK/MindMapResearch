Picard,ffg8eiv,t1_fffo8y9,1579900684.0,"I'm just reading it now and, barring the realities of the show (for instance, drip wasn't nearly as wide spread when they filmed in the 80's/90's as it is today. In fact, I'd say it was almost non-existent in CA at that time) I've got a couple things that stick out to me:

1) On the drip portion, there is actually a lot of growers that prefer NOT to drip in order to refill the aquifer beneath them for their wells. In my area we are drainage impacted, so drip has made a world of difference for us. Perhaps something changed when Jean-Luc went home and he decided to convert.

2) Grapes do prefer drier regions, but they are definitely grown in areas with denser fog and other related issues. There's a reason the Central Valley of California dramatically out yields Napa Valley, but Napa wine prices per ton are often 10x the price of the Central Valley.

3) I do personally wonder how economics, specifically in this instance property rights, works in Star Trek. In First Contact Picard states that humans have move past the desire for money with a goal of bettering themselves. But clearly, private property rights are still a thing hence why his family still owns that estate. Private property rights are, it would seem, a fundamental necessity for operating any kind of an economy, even hundreds of year in the future. Or atleast, that's what seems to be implied."

Picard,fffldce,t1_fff3r10,1579886462.0,"> That being said, we don't really know that they were spraying insecticide (it's just the most reasonable assumption based on current agricultural practices). It could just as easily be some sort of repellent (as opposed to something that actually kills insects/pests), or simply something which makes the plants unappetizing/unappealing to any insects and animals that may otherwise damage the crops.

You know, there is a practice of spraying hormones that drive the bugs way or have some other kind of effect on them. I have limited knowledge of it. But, if that is what they are spraying and it has no toxic exposure to humans, it would explain them both being in the field at the same time. And you could continually spray given the automation apparent in the spray rigs. (I've heard that hormone spraying doesn't have a great residual to keep the pests out.)"

I'm shocked people don't have more of an issue with the ""never go full retard"" bit. I mean, at first it seemed like RDJ's character was making Stiller's character out to be an idiot for thinking he could do simple Jack and get an Oscar.
