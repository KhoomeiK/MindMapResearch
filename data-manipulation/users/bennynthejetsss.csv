Buuuuut it’s unlikely that this person would actually have reliable data on their average temperature over 4 years, and I would be suspicious of labeling that increase in temp as a fever per se.  Now if they went from 97.2 to 99.2, especially in a short amount of time and while using the same equipment, I’d be paying more attention.
Presence of a fever changes the protocol in most ERs. So if the patient has a fever, they may need special labs done, urine culture, etc. to rule out infection. This causes extra pain for the patient, plus time and money. In an ER I can see why that would be frustrating."

Even a child psychologist (which I’m 99% sure OP is not) doesn’t know everything about when gender identities form. OP just sounds transphobic based on their history."

In my opinion, that’s more than enough reason to feel drunk after that little. I find the difference is astounding if I have less in my stomach... On a full stomach, I could knock back 3 or 4 shots and just feel tipsy. On an empty stomach, I’m feeling it a few sips in.

Plus, light beers don’t necessarily have less alcohol, they just have less carbs/calories. (Some actually do have less alcohol but it depends on the beer... sorry if I’m telling you something you already know.)

relationship_advice,fem4rwr,t3_epvjt8,1579239741.0,"She may legitimately not be able to sleep at night. It sounds like that has been her sleep pattern for a long time, so it could be natural for her. For instance, I like to sleep 4 hours, be up for a couple hours, then go back to bed for another four hours.

That said... YOU absolutely deserve YOUR sleep too, so if she wants to put the baby to bed that late, she’s the one who needs to take care of your child at that time. It might be helpful to set a boundary for yourself, such as “I need to have the lights out by 9pm.” Hopefully your counselor can help you establish that boundary and stick to it, while addressing your concern that the needs of your child are being met.

What does your pediatrician say about the late bedtime? As long as baby is getting enough sleep, and mom and dad are getting enough sleep, I don’t see a problem. But maybe hearing it from the pediatrician would help your wife realize the importance of bedtime for all family members."

confession,fel4qra,t3_eppwxs,1579214025.0,"Yep, next time ask her if she’s okay, then once it’s clear she’s having a seizure lay her on her side. Most seizures aren’t medical emergencies if the person is known to have a condition that causes seizures... sometimes they just happen. If it’s the first seizure they’ve had, or you don’t know, definitely call for backup.

However, it’s always a good idea to put the person on their side, clear the area so they don’t get injured from movement, and make sure they’re still breathing. It’s helpful to time the seizure too— it should go away in a couple minutes. Anything longer than 5 minutes is a definite medical emergency."
