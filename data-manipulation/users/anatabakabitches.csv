cats,ffaxpv6,t3_esi1r6,1579746921.0,Your cats are so cute! This is what I hoped for when I got a second cat. Unfortunately the first cat saw the second as a replacement for him and for years bullied the other cat. It's getting better but my goodness I had no idea my cat didn't want a companion even though he cried out from being lonely all the time.
thebachelor,fepp37o,t1_fenpjih,1579326625.0,This is the perfect description! haha
thebachelor,fepoomc,t1_f505b8q,1579326272.0,"Kelsey is a bit of a mess and very immature for her age. I'm all for someone not in their early 20s as the next bachelorette, but I'd like better representation other than Kelsey."
TheBachelorette,fepmpse,t1_feo338u,1579324613.0,"I have a theory about this from personal experience (so don't get all pissy in replies anyone). Men who come from rich helicopter parents usually have some weird complex and yes all of them I know lived with their parents getting financial help until late 20s to mid 30s. Their parents are attached to the hip, like no boundaries at all. I think they feel indebted to their parents so out of guilt they don't create health boundaries. I know a few guys from rich pilot families who are pilots themselves and they are similar to Peter."
thebachelor,fepk2lk,t1_fenfpbi,1579322537.0,As a bisexual Jewish woman I know how it feels to be left out of the wasp groups. Kinda need to watch that season now.
thebachelor,fepjr7j,t3_eq29id,1579322297.0,Dylan is the male version of Regina George.

TooAfraidToAsk,feigrlr,t1_fei2vuj,1579138165.0,Wow you sure have the entire world figured out there for yourself buddy.
AmItheAsshole,fe08csr,t3_enj5hi,1578805827.0,NAH - BUT you shouldn’t expect things from people. People are not entitled to gift giving.
servant,fe07nmu,t1_fd32o6v,1578805238.0,That’s my guess too. Especially since in episode 9 they show the placenta still in the fridge with the tag Jericho.
servant,fe07i7z,t1_fd034qv,1578805114.0,It’s the placenta served unknowingly. My guess.
thebachelor,fdzzjpe,t1_fdwseip,1578799537.0,"I love how angry the girls are about Hannah coming around! They’re threatened for a reason. Totally rooting for both of them to get the life they deserve with each other. 

Everyone makes mistakes, I appreciate her owning up to it. Not an easy thing to do while being filmed. All of America is judging her vulnerability, you need skin of steel for that."
cats,fdzxak1,t3_enhv3r,1578798049.0,Spooky and cute.
AncestryDNA,fdwu43g,t3_en0kac,1578762337.0,"Very unique genetics! DNA has this amazing way of making us learn more about ourselves. Ancestry wasn't accurate for my DNA, it showed only 1% mediterranean which is not my case. I feel like it's better to look for family members. Using the admixture feature on gedmatch it was much more accurate for telling me my genetics. I think Ancestry mixed up a lot of my genetics and lumped it all in European Jewish and showed all of Europe. I'd be interested in seeing what results you get using another algorithm for your genetics."
Blep,fdwru07,t3_en562w,1578761755.0,"A majestic wizard blep! ""You're a wizard Gemma!"""
EMDR,fdwrn2f,t3_emwuvz,1578761692.0,I'm so happy for you! Glad to hear all the hard work you put into healing has paid off and there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
thebachelor,fdwr4c2,t1_fdwb1rz,1578761514.0,That was my first thought. Especially after seeing the first episode. All these new babies are immature and clueless to Peter and you can see him having fun with them as the new bachelor. Then Hannah comes in breaking down his walls he's worked building up. His interview at the end of the episode shook me.
thebachelor,fdtgnb3,t3_emw6j1,1578716486.0,Holy shit... she can’t even make a new line up about herself? I can’t.
