Etomidate can definitely be used for procedural sedation in lower doses. I don't personally use it often for that indication, but you definitely could. I usually just do a few cc's of propofol at a time (and alfentanil if it's available) until the patient is only responsive to sternal rub, since the stimulus of cardioversion is so brief that something like etomidate will outlast the need for sedation for quite a while.

IntensiveCare,fef54wn,t3_eotmfl,1579048408.0,"Anesthesia/critical care MD here. Here's some info on the drugs you requested. In general, need for intubation should be determined by (1) clinical status/treatment goals and (2) depth of sedation. Paralyzed patients should always be intubated and ALSO sedated so they don't end up intubated, paralyzed, and completely aware (nightmare stuff). You can achieve any depth of sedation with almost any single drug or combination of these drugs, but some are better than others for certain indications. That said, all hospitals will have rules about who can give which meds in which ways (MD or RN) and which meds can be administered to patients without a protected airway. Also, if the patient has a source of pain (I work in SICU so everyone has some sort of incisional pain), you will want some dedicated analgesics to treat pain in addition to the sedative meds.

&#x200B;

Sedatives:

\-propofol: sedative/hypnotic. Can be used in infusion or bolus form. Most ICUs require all patients on propofol infusions to be intubated unless it's being used for procedural sedation for something like an EGD, in which case there usually needs to be either an anesthesia provider or ICU doc administering and managing the sedation. Does provide sedation and amnesia, will not provide any analgesia. Common side effects are respiratory depression and peripheral vasodilation and myocardial depression --> hypotension.

\-dexmedetomidine: can be used as a mild sedative or an anxiolytic, is usually not enough to provide deeper levels of sedation unless used in conjunction with other agents. Does not cause respiratory depression, so can be used for patients who are not intubated or as a bridge to and through extubation in patients who might have anxiety/delirium/PTSD. Does have analgesic properties. Common side effects are bradycardia > hypotension.

\-ketamine: analgesic with dissociative properties. Most commonly used as a pain adjunct, either with intermittent or infusion dosing. Also can be used as an induction agent for intubation. Does not require intubation because it does not suppress airway reflexes. Common side effects are tachycardia, dissociation/dysphoria, increases in intracranial (traditionally taught although recent studies do not support this) and intraocular pressure, and possible laryngospasm.

\-etomidate: sedative/hypnotic. Usually used as a bolus for induction for intubation. May have less hypotension than propofol, but critically ill patients will drop their pressure nonetheless once you take away the sympathetic drive keeping their blood pressure up while they are in extremis. Generally will require bag mask ventilation and usually intubation.

&#x200B;

Neuromuscular blockers (NOT SEDATIVES):

\-succinylcholine: depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug. Causes all muscle fibers to contract (you may see widespread twitching aka fasciculation) after which there is a several minute period of paralysis before the sux gets metabolized and the muscles regain function. Most serious potential complications are life-threatening acute hyperkalemia in patients who are either already hyperkalemic or in those who have lots of de-recruited muscles, such as patients with longstanding paralysis or crush injuries, and malignant hyperthermia in patients with a history or family history of hyperthermia. Absolutely requires airway support and is NOT a sedative; has no sedative, analgesic, or amnestic properties; used in the ICU only as an induction agent for intubation.

\-rocuronium: nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug. Binds and antagonizes the acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction, preventing acetylcholine binding until it's metabolized away (45 minutes or so in patients with normal hepatic and renal function). Can be reversed emergently with high doses of sugammadex. Pretty safe although there is a non-zero risk of anaphylaxis. Does not have the hyperkalemia or MH risks of sux. Like sux, this is NOT a sedative. It has no sedative, analgesic, or amnestic properties. Patients MUST be intubated; it is usually used in the ICU as an induction agent for intubation.

\-cisatracurium: a different kind of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug. Can also be used for intubation and tends to be the agent of choice for infusion in patients who require prolonged paralysis because its metabolism is independent of organ function (metabolized by plasma esterases in about 30-45 minutes) and because it has been associated with lower risks for critical illness polymyopathy/polyneuropathy. Again, has no sedative/analgesic/amnestic properties and can only be given to intubated patients.
