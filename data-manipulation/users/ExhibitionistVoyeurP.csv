New testament has slightly updated morals but plenty of weird stuff too.

Jesus cursed a tree to die because it was out of season and he really wanted a fig.

Jesus called non-jews dogs who deserve scraps.

Jesus took a whip to people doing business in the church (the last church I was in had a coffee shop and gift shop inside)

jesus said he didn't come to bring peace but a sword

God  killed 2 early christian church members because they lied about not  giving up all their possessions to the church (the early church was  communist [http://www.godhatesrichpeople.com/](http://www.godhatesrichpeople.com/) )

The  bible says women cannot speak in church, cannot be leaders, and cannot  hold office over a man.  It says this in multiple different places in  multiple different ways.  Even today women cannot be priests.

The early christians had flames over their heads and could speak any language. (Where Pentecostal denominations come from)

etc."
trippinthroughtime,fen4iov,t1_femzj56,1579276794.0,"As a former christian minister who became an atheist after too much bible study there are so many terrible stories to pick:

 

One story has daughters getting their father drunk so they can rape him and get pregnant.

Another  has a guy give his sex slave to a gang to be raped to death  outside  his tent, then he cuts her in to twelve pieces when he retrieves  her  dead body the next day.

Another  has the famous king david collecting hundreds of foreskins in  a bag to  impress a guy so he can marry his daughter.  The implication  being  non-israelites had foreskins so that means he had killed all these  guys  from other tribes and cut off their penis.

Later  King David has his commander and friend killed so that he can take his  wife because David saw her bath and thought she was hot. (yes David had  multiple wives and sex slaves because that is what traditional marriage  is)

Several times when Israel  conquers another local tribe god commands  them to kill all the women,  children, and even their animals so there is  nothing left of them.   Sometimes god tells them it is ok to keep the  children as sex slaves.   (concubines as the book likes to call them.   Those were real popular in  the old testament)

Oh yeah in  another place god gives instructions on how it is OK to  take slaves  from other tribes.  You just can't take slaves from israel.   Unless  they own you money, then they can be your slave for 7 years.

Another talks about a woman lusting after penises that were the size of donkey penises and had emissions of a horse.

God has a bear maul 40 children to death because they made fun of a guy for being bald.

God commands to murder gay people.

The  bible lists a test for a woman that is faithful.  The priest gives the  woman a potion of dirt from his floor and makes her drink it.  If the  woman has been unfaithful she will get sick and abort her baby.  If she  is faithful nothing with happen.  The only place the bible mentions  abortion is a recipe to kill children.

The  bible explains that if you want striped animals you can get them by  tying two ribbons of different colors together, and then having the  animals mate while looking at the two ribbons.

Humans  decided to build a tower (in Babel) so high that it would reach in to  heaven.  God became afraid that they would find him so he made each of  them speak a different language so they would be confused and stop their  project.  This is how multiple languages came about according to the  bible.

There are two sets of 10  commandments in the bible.  The only set that actually has the phrase  ""10 commandments"" in it is the set that includes laws like do not mix  milk and cheese.  Somehow Christians never want to put this set up in  court houses.

talking donkeys is just the beginning.  The book is brutal, filled with genocide, violence, and rape."

ABoringDystopia,fdrnnw2,t1_fdrlhdx,1578687090.0,">human societies must survive and to do that requires resources and management of time and effort.

That doesn't take working non-stop though.  Even our hunter-gatherer ancestors worked fewer hours than we do.  Our ""work ethic"" is absolutely a cultural ideal.  Not all societies see non-stop toiling as a good thing.

I spent some time in Africa and the culture sock was pretty strong for me.  I was in the IT industry and used to working long hours.  In Africa people value relaxing time were there is nothing planned but enjoying life.  You don't meet at exactly 6pm, have dinner and rush out.  People spend literal hours at restaurants just relaxing.  It was tough for a goal oriented person like myself because sometimes you would just sit for 30 minutes before getting menus, then 30 more minutes waiting for food, then 30 more minutes waiting for the check.  But it only bothered me because that is was part of the experience, just to sit, talk, relax, and have no goal or need to rush out to the next activity.  It wasn't about how quickly we could finish.  It was about enjoying the present.  People were so much less stressed even when they were poor.  It was astounding.  I came back to the US and noticed how stressed and unhappy everyone seemed all the time."
