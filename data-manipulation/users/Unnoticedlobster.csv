Bedbugs,ffdk8qd,t3_et1gog,1579822646.0,"Treat cracks and crevices and areas where they could hide.  What I have learned to use this stuff the best way was to use 1/6th of the container into a spray bottle with water.   If you use it as a dust, make sure to use a respirator or a dust mask and let it settle before anyone goes in that room.  There's been a few times now I was applying it with out a mask and it really messed with my lungs.   Any more questions just let me know."

Bedbugs,fey8d6h,t3_eqtqkr,1579442005.0,"Really looks like bedbugs are a foot.  Start prepping now and I would start getting quotes from different post control companies and see if they can find them for you. Before going any further.  I usually told my customers ( switched to route tech from start tech meaning I'm not dealing with bedbugs any more) to gather up all your clothes and wash them and make sure you put them in the dryer on high heat for 45 mins.  Then put them in large trash bags and are sealed away from the room.  When you wake up in the morning, before you do anything, make sure to take off what you wore to bed and immediately put it in a trash bag to do laundry or put them in the dryer asap to help stop them from spreading to another room and keep that up until you know it's safe.  

If possible,  get a steamer and hit all the cracks and crevices in the bedroom, bed frame, windowsill  etc.  

Have any more questions just let me know."

gaming,fellh88,t1_felfi2l,1579225016.0,Was a nurse assistant for 8 long years before getting into pest control and I recall maybe Bout 30 residents or so had actual laptops that they were allowed to bring in.  At least 300 or so with iPads and most of them with iPhones or a cell phone that can browse the web and Facebook.  Every rehab I worked at had wifi.
AutoChess,feb7gwx,t1_feagow9,1578956135.0,Would be nice to have on the switch as well honestly.  Haven't checked out the update yet but either way will be playing.   Lately it's been auto chess or vainglory for me.
Bedbugs,fe2ak6l,t3_enjwxw,1578836320.0,"Little tip for it.   If you don't want it as. Powdered form when applying it, mix it with water in a spray bottle when using it on bed rails and baseboards.   

That and wear a mask if your doing powdered.  That stuff really messes up my lungs for a while."
pestcontrol,fdzv9ln,t3_enhaxw,1578796618.0,"Millipedes my friend.   I find them alot of the times outside by an area that's damp.  Like around actually drip lines or by plants that collect water.   Treatment wise, a good repellent should work and also dust like cymexa.   Treat cracks and crevices."

Bedbugs,fcp5cxt,t3_eidib5,1577850982.0,Definitely bedbugs:(
funny,fcmtxgh,t1_fcmto5u,1577792094.0,6th here. Have it for the music and I watch mainly YouTube vids on a daily basis.  Had it over a year now and I ain't going back!
AutoChess,fcij06c,t3_efp34m,1577663346.0,Went from a galaxy s7 and stopped for a while till I just recently got a galaxy A20. Phone itself is an upgrade to what I was used to and now i can actually run the game smoothly and able to move my units with out lag and on a small phone.  (Also i have tiny hands xD)
AutoChess,fciic98,t3_eh5ik2,1577663030.0,Been running warrior with two range if possible. Knight 4 after like 6 wins in a row.  Loving the game so far.
pestcontrol,fcgjt4l,t3_eh79p2,1577640951.0,Definitely bagworms as someone posted.  A good repellent and a way to dehumidifier your room would do the trick.  Damp feeling areas attract them.

aww,fcb1sj1,t1_fcb1kdy,1577581054.0,Ugmmmm depends on the beadie honestly.  We have one female that loves me and only snuggles me and not my wife but we have a Male that loves her and just puts up with me.  I do believe they can be affectionate but just depends on them.
aww,fcayhj8,t1_fcawj2d,1577579121.0,"Not OP but they are right about the poop trick.  My wife and I do this for all five of our beadies when we let the go about ( not all out at the same time)  warm water kinda helps them go.  For the glass surfing, it's mainly because they see their own reflection inside their tanks and they are territorial as hell.  Some dragons won't poop in their tank unless they really have to and they will sit in front of their tanks sometimes to let their humans know they want out to either potty or just hang out."
gaming,fcankz3,t1_fc9z2fe,1577572816.0,I was gifted one a few years ago and haven't used it until xbox xcloud came out and used it to play smash on my switch while I'm in bed.  Thought it was dumb as hell until I got board while the wife was watching 90 day fiancee.
Bedbugs,fc7h85h,t3_eglsj6,1577507359.0,That's definitely a tick.
Bedbugs,fc7ge6g,t3_egj9nn,1577506641.0,"So from reading and seeing your replies and seeing your picture you posted. From my experience the stains are not bedbug fecies. Bedbugs have small dots that are black.  Now bedbugs can live up to 4 to 8 months dormant stage without feeding. 

My biggest recommend choice for you is to call a few companies to do an inspection.  Now if you do that, ask for an actual technician to come out, most of the time places like terminix and orkin would send out sales people and they are just there to make money.  Have them send a tech to look.  It's free to do an inspection.   After they are finished, have them explain to you what they think is going on in detail.  

I'm a tech who  primarily deals with bedbugs for a large company in southwest Florida and deals with them on a daily basis. Besides the bed and bed frame, check your drawers, windowsills, corners of your room both uo and down and so forth.   If you check my profile or on this subreddit,  I have posted recently a prime example where to find them and I do have photos of objects I have found them on and in."
pestcontrol,fc7flpf,t3_eglkmu,1577505955.0,"Phantom works great and same with alpine and temprid.  If you can, could you tell us what kind of gel baits are you using and how you are using it as well?  And instead of borax , I would recommend cymexa as a dust for the wall voids."
Bedbugs,fc079yl,t3_efcmv6,1577281589.0,Pest tech here who deals with bedbugs on a daily basis.   Not a bedbug. Abdominal area to long and thing is moving to fast.  Seems to be a moth of some type but not sure.
