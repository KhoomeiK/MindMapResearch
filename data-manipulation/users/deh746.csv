personalfinance,fehodut,t1_fehh3nw,1579120634.0,This answer concerns me: you’ll be a better partner and father once you get your financial house in order. Prioritize *that*. The “good school” and a girlfriend should wait. And considering getting engaged? Terribly unwise at this time.
todayilearned,fehkboc,t1_fegx1tt,1579118293.0,Why is it a bad thing if I want to work my ass off and pass the results of my labors to my kids? Why should it default to the state upon my death?
news,feek5zo,t3_eols1w,1579035396.0,I’m less worried about hackers than I am government staff with “carefully monitored access” abusing it daily. And you know this is EXACTLY what would happen because we already know it is. Police use their access to data to lookup info on people of personal interest all the time!

amex,fe6h72a,t3_enwzyr,1578890792.0,If you want to keep your “reputation strong” don’t take a sign-up bonus and then cancel to avoid the second annual fee. Seems simple enough.

Your family seems to be under the impression that you owe them something. You don’t; your time belongs to you alone."

ABoringDystopia,fbgwwz4,t3_ed64u8,1576860458.0,This will get downvoted but: maybe read the policy? I know it’s long but it’s not insurmountable and literally tells you what you’re paying for and thus getting.
