Always check the reviews on the clinics and hospitals. You can even just talk to the front people on the phone or in person. I wish you luck! I believe in you."

But, like, guys, aren't we all being vulnerable right now?

This entire sub is about vulnerability. Sure, I can't see your face, and I don't know who you all are. But admitting that you're hurting, talking about for feelings and experiences in this sub, and openly supporting one another is *vulnerable*. 

This is a safe place to vent. You'll find lotsa others on the internet to vent to as well... and someday, hopefully, we can all find someone offline to trust enough to vent to."

I am definitely not a therapist or anything close to a mental health expert, but I think these feelings are normal for people with anxiety and depression. Another thing it could be is called depersonalization. 

You can always type in symptoms into Google and talk to therapists about them. Don't diagnose yourself, but just be curious about your illness. Be proactive and talk about those feelings."

AskWomen,fejma01,t3_epabx4,1579179675.0,"They have a healthy amount of self worth. I also find that most healthy people are really balanced and can admit they're wrong. They allow themselves to be vulnerable without oversharing. They can understand both sides of the issue and can actually listen. 

Also they don't throw fits like toddlers. 

And they don't disrespect people working at low level jobs. They don't spit at restaurant staff."
AskWomen,fejlox5,t3_epbo4h,1579179122.0,"My bestie. I love him like a freaking brother. 

He was adopted from Russia, already big oof.
He's now in a therapy program far away right now, but it doesn't seem to change much. He's mother is super abusive mentally, psychologically, and verbally. Real bible thumper, narcissistic, and rich, she has complete control over him, and she hates me because she can't control me. He's an adult, but completely reliant on her money.

He OD'ed recently and was brought to the hospital. He tried to commit suicide last month. 

He's turned into a drunk to try to numb the pain that depression, anxiety, and social awkwardness gives him which is why the med changes aren't doing anything. 

The worst part is that I can't do anything to help him. He saved my life in highschool, and all I can do is tell him I'm there. I can't save my bro. I don't know if his luck is going to change."

Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap is one of my all time favorite Zeldas. I also enjoy Kingdom Hearts: Chain of memories, which I believe, is the game that saved the Kingdom Hearts series. Both of these are on the GBA."
