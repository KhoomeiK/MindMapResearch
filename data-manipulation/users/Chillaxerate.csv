AskReddit,fflwrrh,t1_fflhbfo,1580045069.0,"Recognizing it is key, and if you can work on it without being unkind, then it doesn’t have to ruin your relationship.  Just remember that feeling like someone you love and would never ever leave or cheat on doesn’t believe in your devotion is painful,"

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffc2txz,t1_ffc0441,1579790145.0,"I don’t get why people don’t understand this.  Don’t compare anything to slavery, use the word when you are talking only about the literal act.  Don’t use the word rape to describe something that’s not related to the forcible sexual act.  Don’t call something “like the Holocaust” unless you mean it 100% literally.  Don’t compare something to Jim Crow laws unless they are really closely factually related.  There is no reason to demean or mischaracterize things that have happened to real people and have a very specific legacy and *it never makes your point stronger*.   

The point that students shouldn’t have to scrape by stands on its own."
relationships,ffc1era,t3_essm1j,1579789088.0,"The way you explain it, the primary issue is inequality.  That is a family dynamic that’s real, whether it’s as property or who hosts a holiday dinner.  So that alone merits discussion.  It sounds like your mom May be thinking of how to split “her” assets equally and not considering the overall difference between you and your sister, so the intention isn’t necessarily bad.  

Are there other issues with your sister that make this more sensitive?  And how is your financial situation apart from the property? 

If this doesn’t turn out the way you feel is fair, I understand you will be hurt.  But you don’t yet know this for a fact. So it’s worth it to discuss it calmly with your
Mom, and if it is related to larger family dynamics, make sure you have thought about what they are so the conversation doesn’t turn into something like “she always gets” etc.  (which may be true but decreases the likelihood of a calm and productive conversation)."
AmItheAsshole,ff7h1dr,t3_es1t6f,1579649363.0,"YTA - it’s a cliche for a reason, you criticize the kid’s behavior if you need to, don’t say blanket things like “you’re dumb” because it sounds like: l know you’re dumb, you will always be dumb, and I am not going to let you forget it.  Which is pretty much the opposite of parenting.  You don’t need to say “great idea son, I’m proud” but since he is so obviously embarrassed, you closed off an opportunity to ask more questions and maybe get to the bottom of the story.  What if he’s being bullied and someone did that to him? What if he’s committing self-harm in other ways?  What if it’s a hickey from his older lover?  What if he is secretly practicing non-permanent tattooing....

Lots of mysteries, and I worry you will only find the answers out if something bad happens because you have dismissed him.  Kids can do dumb things, but their moms shouldn’t call them dumb."
todayilearned,fezrqq7,t3_eqzhms,1579460804.0,"Some of the posts in this thread are concerning.  A few points:

1) Just because some charities are flawed does not mean it’s not worth it to give to charities.  

2) There are many tools to investigate/audit charities, seeing how much money goes to overhead, making sure it’s complying with relevant laws, etc.  see, e.g. charitynavigator.org.

3)  It should not be shocking that sometimes when you are trying to work in countries in the middle of turmoil, messing up rule of law and infrastructure, all services are vulnerable including aid.  But usually people are working hard to get the money to the right places.

4.  Puerto Rico is part of the US, and therefore not a recipient of foreign aid. (!)

5.  Some people are cynical, some people are jaded, some people are anxious but some people seem to be looking for excuses not to help.  (Not saying donation is the only way - time, education, etc. are all important, just a weird tone in *some* of these posts).  It’s true that if you are not part of the solution you are part of the problem.

6.  If you care about injustice, whatever your cause may be - cats, kids, climate, mass incarceration, barriers to practicing religion, freedom from unwanted religion,  hunger, whatever - some people out there are working to make a difference on your behalf, and that’s awesome.

Edit: not that it matters but I can’t fix the numbering, when I write the comment it’s right, when I post it it’s wrong.  Oh well."

AskReddit,feyfvqz,t1_fey8jop,1579444953.0,"Have you talked to a doctor?  Sometimes it is a physical (or medication) thing.  (A friend didn’t have her first until her late 20s, it was both psychological and she to some medication she has to take, once she knew she could work around it).  Also, not to presume gender, but often women have to do a lot of experimenting until we learn ourselves (and that’s important before you can help someone else do it for you, if that’s the goal).  And whatever works to get you in the mood is awesome, but most porn is not a great instruction guide for what you think your body should be doing/how it should be reacting, or even what an orgasm looks like.  Everyone is different.  But don’t give up, you deserve orgasms.

relationship_advice,fe842tc,t3_eo3hoq,1578922299.0,"This isn’t really about porn, it’s about controlling you and being consistently dishonest.  I generally don’t think anyone has an obligation to discuss or disclose their sexual phantasies or porn use at all but here the issue is hypocrisy in what he expects from you.  It’s up to you to figure out what is a healthy sex life for you but it sounds like you’re concerned for some substantive reasons.  I would definitely talk to him about it, being honest (looking at his search history is bad, but you can own that without “losing” the right to discuss a significant problem).  It sounds like with the move and some other things it might be good to see a counselor together."
bestof,fdm0iyk,t3_em2001,1578536920.0,"I appreciate the point and it sucks that people lost their jobs  point but it’s pretty  convenient/dramatic to blame FB for “destroying sites” and “leaving them in ashes” when FB created a product people liked, and creators wanted to take advantage of the platform - making what is conceded to be a lot of money - but creators knew they did not control the platform.  Just because it’s big doesn’t mean you should gamble on continuing to make a huge amount of cash forever, and rely on the predictability of a company whose primary concern is the success of their own platform, not your content.  Television exists.  Other platforms exist.  The whole rest of the internet exists.  FB can’t and hasn’t taken that away.

People’s tastes and expectations for entertainment have been dramatically changing with the increased role the internet plays - and that ‘s hard for people who are investing in business models that don’t reflect those changes.  (see, eg, the recording industry).  If creators who don’t like it leave the platform and then users leave - or just spend less time on FB because they want better entertainment content -FB has to suffer the consequences and no one should shed any tears for them.

FB has a lot of problems that can have a more insidious impact on their users (divisive political/conspiracy campaigns, bullying, a weird stance on free speech that lets garbage people do garbage things).  But it’s irresponsible to place blame on FB for creators
gambling that a free service would continue to make you money rather than changing.  

Framing social media as the cause all problems obscures both real problems and all the other social factors that are all not caused by one or a few companies.  And people aren’t sheep who are obligated to eat what is on the algorithm menu.  many people leave FB because they don’t like the service.  But when users flock to these companies, it’s evident that the tech companies are giving people what they want.  And if people want low quality content, or accept it in the place of higher quality content like yours, that shows that FB users might have bad taste and that’s just a fact of life. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk. (Next talk: We also can’t  blame video game for wasting people’s time when people like me spend  too much time writing too long posts on reddit.)"
AmItheAsshole,fdlx9f7,t1_fdlsswu,1578534691.0,"YTA but not for not showing up.  Echoing this.  Brain injuries can alter personalities (hopefully temporarily) if this is an atypically extreme reaction I would chalk it up to that.  If she needs some extra attention, there’s no harm in giving it to her, without needing to say you should have gone to the hospital.  It’s petty to bring it up unless it still bothers you, in which case you should discuss it after she is in a better place physically.

Edit: fwiw, I have done a lot of work on traumatic brain injuries.  The impact is real.  I don’t get the downvotes, but to each their own."
relationship_advice,fdlwv39,t3_em205j,1578534422.0,"I think the main problem is him saying “you have to admit the little extra made a big difference.”   That was clearly inappropriate.  Maybe you should have stayed your objections to his behavior more clearly, but his comment was telling you to admit there is a “big difference” between your meal and how he would have fixed your meal.

Making adjustments may be second nature to him but then he shouldn’t ask you to cook for him unless he can be hands off or make it an inclusive process, especially if you’re intimidated.

And being a chef does not mean he is always right, people have different preferences and different cuisines have different needs.  He can’t help caring about food and improvements are great, but he needs to be open-minded about your approach.  

But most importantly, he needs to not put down your cooking if he wants you to cook again."

AmItheAsshole,fcnh0rq,t1_fcnbcz5,1577811528.0,"This is my take exactly.  Since we live in an imperfect world, you know some people have (dumb) feelings about boys and makeup, and although your relatives are cool with you, you knew it might be an issue with them and their son.  

It is fantastic to support him and let him know you think his interests are normal and cool.  And it sounds like he might need that even more as time goes by.

But if you think a gift might not go over well, it’s a gamble with everyone’s feelings to hope any opposition by the parents will be smoothed over when they see how happy he is.  Because that may just make it more painful for him when they aren’t cool with it, highlighting a family tension on Christmas.
