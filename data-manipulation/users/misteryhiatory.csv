Also I once decided to not go on a red even if I could because the dodo bird behind me blew the horn the moment I stopped to look. The more he blew his horn, the louder Boston’s “Peace of Mind” would get. So, I was pretty petty at one point in my life."

I’m copying the typical Rep. comeback to anything a Dem says, and turning it back on you: “Orange man bad.”

Yes you do use words like that. One, you probably often say something as stupid as: “I can’t be racist, I have a Black/Hispanic/Asian friend.” Which is pretty dumb, you have to group your “friends” like that? I work with a deaf person, so you think when someone says I’m being insensitive towards another person with disabilities that I come back with the fact that I work with a deaf person? No, because it’s stupid and I’m probably being insensitive because it’s easier to say stupid things especially when someone is different from you.

Two, because there are many others in the Dems that say the same thing but y’all just target ones that are “easy” targets which more or less just you’re afraid of them being on equal footing as you.

Three. Thunberg is dumb and AoC is a moron? Okay typical of people who are afraid of children or women. They’re dumb when they say something you don’t agree with. “Can’t possibly be capable of thinking on their own, they have to have handlers.”

So Thunberg is a victim of her parents? You mean an actual education that taught her to think for herself and not to test; in a system geared toward learning, not an athletic farming system?

How does her Autism make her dumb too dumb? Because the form she has is Asperger’s syndrome, characterized by just socialization issues typically.

Her parents beliefs? Haha don’t make me laugh so hard I shoot tea out of my nose. You only have a problem with her “repeating her parents’” only because they don’t align with yours. If she and her parents were high on the corporate that stand to loose shit tons of money over the reality of climate change, you’d have her poster on your wall and attend as many rallies as you can. This is is just simply tribalism at its highest which you seem to be high on yourself.

And that video? Why is that even a thing for you? She has the same ideas as other? Omg the world must be ending if two or more people agree on an actual issue that is a problem in America."
