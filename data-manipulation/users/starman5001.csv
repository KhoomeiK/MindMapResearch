Mikhail Gorbachev - The Soviet union was bad and all but he did not deserve a prize for collapsing his country.  

Al Gore - Climate change is bad and all but Al Gore has done nothing to truly fix the problem.

Barack Obama - I actually like president Obama but he did not deserve the prize.

The European union - This is not even a person, and its debatable if the EU is actually preventing war.  

Mother Teresa - A truly revolting and corrupt person who abused her patients, coddled up with dictators, and got sainthood out of it.

Danzo killed or attempted to kill many leaf shinobi for there Sharingan, including an attempt on Kakashi, all for a technique that keeps only himself safe. 

Danzo also encouraged and advocated for keeping the Uchiha clan isolated and separated form the rest of the village. Danzo is the prime reason the tension between the Uchiha and the leaf got so tense. 

Danzo attacked and stole Shisui Uchiha's eye. The one thing that may have prevented a coup from breaking out. Then did not use it in any way to prevent a coup.

Then for his grand finale he manipulated Itachi and used him to wipe out the clan to the last child. Danzo then attempted to assassinate Itachi after he left the village. 

If anything all signs point to Danzo wanting the coup to take place. Ridding the village of the Uchiha clan and leaving him as the only one with both wood style and the Sharingan. 

If his attempt on Kakashi's life had succeeded, Tenzo not betrayed him, and Itachi not spared his brother. Danzo would have succeeded. Giving him the power to become the next Hokage."

The federation engages in prolonged solitary confinement. Something that is considered a war crime in many modern nations due the philological trauma. Michael Eddington and Tom Paris where both subject to prolonged periods of isolation.

In the 23rd century the federation had penal colonies. Of the two shown in TOS Tantalus was the site of unethical brainwashing experiments. While the Elba II asylum also used brainwashing as a ""treatment method."" 

It is also mentioned that major reforms had taken place before TOS and the conditions used to be even more barbaric. So these two penal colonies where the ""good ones"".

3) By the early 22nd century the Borg have build up enough in the Sol system and begin expanding outwards. Vulcan, Andor, and the other core worlds of what could have been the federation are assimilated with little resistance.

4) After the Borgs initial blitzkrieg the remaining powers go into full panic mode. The Romulans and Klingons form an alliance to counter the Borg. The two powers are able to slow the Borg but not stop them.

5) By the 23rd century most of the major worlds in known space have fallen to the Borg. However some small remote outposts still exist. However most survivors are fleeing known space and fleeing to the unknown reaches of the beta and deep alpha quadrant.
