AskReddit,ffasv4q,t3_esd42q,1579743703.0,"1. Hydrate. 
2. Give the benefit of the doubt, just because someone is acting like a jerk doesn’t mean they are a jerk.  
3. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  Do everything you can to take care of your body, teeth, car, home. That stuff adds up if left neglected.   
4. Be kind to animals. They have but a short time on this earth.   
5. LISTEN to those with much more life experience. And repay the favor by letting them talk things out.   
6. Wash. Your. Hands."
