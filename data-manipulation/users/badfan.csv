I hunt because if I have the choice of encouraging a factory farming system that treats all animals like property (and usually, not at all well) or allowing an animal to live a natural life in the wild and to only be taken from that environment once there is need; I would definitely choose the latter.

Some may think it's a bit hokey, but where I was raised, after taking an animals life you thank the animal for providing life and sustenance. It's not a ceremony or anything complex, just a moment of slience and reflection, with a quiet and earnest ""thank you."" I'm not trying to be ""badfan, master of the forest"" or anything like that. The point of all of this is to keep me aware of my interaction with the world around me and my impact on all of it. Thank you for asking, neighbor."

For me, I hope (I would pray if I did that sort of thing) that I never, ever, EVER, use a gun anywhere other than hunting or on the range. I consider every person on the planet a neighbor, and I never want to hurt anyone, even if it's to protect myself. Because I know that if I did, it would change me at a fundamental level, I don't know what into, but I love myself enough for who I am right now that I know I'd like to stay that way.
