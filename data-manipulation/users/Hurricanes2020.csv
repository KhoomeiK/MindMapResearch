askdentists,ffah47f,t1_ff9i78h,1579735607.0,Yeah I have receding gums and sensitive lower molars. I do use an electric toothbrush a few times out of the week- it has a sensitive function. These super soft bristle brushes I found them at target but amazon has them too. Have you tried sensodyne rapid relief? It is awesome!

AskVet,fey6qlq,t3_eqtz0q,1579441457.0,Most definitely you should take you cat to the vet. Even just inhaling the pollen can cause kidney failure down the line.
