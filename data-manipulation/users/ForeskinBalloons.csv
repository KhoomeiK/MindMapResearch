AskMen,fgivdb5,t1_fgio2bv,1580831729.0,"Okay then here’s what you do specifically:

Don’t feel smart: read more books

Feeling skinny/fat: eat healthier and workout more

Have a shitty job: go to community college, trade school, or university 

Don’t feel handsome: learn how dress and groom yourself better

Feel that other men are better and are hitting on your gf: grow a pair and tell them to fuck off

That’s how any insecurity is going to get fixed, doing the things until you feel secure in that area."
AskMen,fgiv0xw,t1_fgihqle,1580831520.0,Okay then don’t knock it off and go around sulking to your girlfriend about how she deserves better until she does just that.
AskMen,fgiutfj,t1_fgif91u,1580831388.0,It really is that simple. Read all the self help books and tips you want but eventually it all comes down to acting like a man with confidence. And if you truly cannot get over your insecurities then seek a therapist.
AskMen,fgiugxt,t1_fghbtqt,1580831174.0,Yup I had a girlfriend like this and it absolutely tanked my interest in her and the relationship.
AskMen,fgitu5f,t3_eyhjbn,1580830775.0,"By knowing that she chose me for more than just looks. Also knowing that I was good looking enough to grab her attention in the first place. 

Also if you have this kind of mindset then your insecurities will become reality and it’ll happen very fast."

Only problem is that this is both our last semesters in school and I'm not sure where we'll be living/working once I graduate. It feels like an all or nothing situation for me because I haven't had much dating success in my time here in college and it feels like graduation is the deadline with her. I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself now so idk what to do about it."

AskMen,ffti177,t3_ev2v2k,1580221087.0,"You have to put the legwork in yourself if you want to feel wanted. Meetup.com, dating apps, talking to random people in the line at Starbucks or wherever, volunteering, group classes at the gym or crossfit. It’s also a mindset, if you feel like someone doesn’t want to hang with you, chances are your emitting that when you’re around them.

But also to occupy your mind on bad days I recommend working out and reading books for enjoyment. Personally if I can escape into another world via reading it’s quite comforting."
