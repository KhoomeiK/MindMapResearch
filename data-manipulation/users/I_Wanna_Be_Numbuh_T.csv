ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,ffaiq2r,t1_ffaezpb,1579736697.0,"Okay. Follow up questions. 

1. Do you understand the distinction between private property and personal property? i.e. the difference between an individual owning land/buildings for personal use and an individual/company holding land as capital?

2. Is not being beyond the use of violence a legitimate criticism, especially considering that -
 
 a. The fight between people struggling to survive and people who just want to earn more billions is most certainly not an even fight.

 b. There is no political ideology in existence that isn't okay with violence against SOME group for some reason.

 c. The perpetuation of state violence and overseas endless wars in the interest of preserving capital for the rich, and the deaths caused by them, are much more vast and much less morally justified?

I suggest you go out of your way understand the history of antifascism vs fascism, and the nuances of each ideology, before criticising them.

>""When the white Americans tell the negro to lift himself by his own bootstraps, they don't look over the legacy of slavery and segregation. I believe we ought to do all we can and seek to lift ourselves up by our own bootstraps, but it's a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself up by his own bootstraps. And many negroes, by the thousands and millions, have been left bootless as a result of all these years of oppression, and as a result of a society that deliberately made his color a stigma and something worthless and degrading.""

todayilearned,feuf96m,t1_fetblkq,1579385971.0,"Really popular metal bands, new and old, that do clean vocals almost exclusively:

Pretty much anything power metal: (DragonForce, Powerwolf, Manowar, Hammerfall)

Black Sabbath. Both Ozzy and Dio eras are good.

Rainbow

Dio

Judas Priest

Katatonia. Beautiful and melancholy. The word ""lovely"" comes to mind a lot when I talk about them. Jonas Renkse has a super handsome and soothing voice. Personal top 3 albums are Night Is the New Day, The Great Cold Distance, and Dead End Kings. They've been a personal favorite of mine in recent years.

Candlemass. Can't go wrong with some old school doom.

Nightwish. Check out their live set at Wacken Open Air in 2014. Especially Ghost Love Score. Floor has a fantastic set of chops and is easily my favorite vocalist of theirs.

Killswitch Engage does have some screaming, but the instrumentals and clean vocals are too good to ignore. Both Howard Jones and Jesse Leach have awesome singing voices. Their cover of Dio's Holy Diver is great, but their original work stands much better on its own.

Iron Maiden. 'Nuff said.

Instrumental progressive is a good way to go if you like polyrhythms and weird time/key changes. Plini has a beautiful track called Electric Sunrise that has the intro/refrain in 13/8 time, yet grooves super well. Rick Beato's video on it is a testament to its quality. Intervals and Pomegranate Tiger are good as well. Good Tiger is worth looking into if you prefer something with vocals, as is Intervals' second album, in which the bass player lends his singing chops."

Their music can get quite a bit heavier sometimes, too. As evidenced in the breakdown in [this song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfqddR_FZpY) And also [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSeLfsyCnC0)

BreadTube,fdmzlsl,t1_fdmc6pm,1578572557.0,"> TBH he puts a lot of emphasis on membership and paying dues, but the most important thing is organizing your workplace

That's because the membership dues thing is one of the biggest reasons a lot of people in the US don't join a union. The primary narrative for decades has been about how unions are scam artists who take money out of each paycheck for little to no benefit to the worker. Now, of course this is false, but it's the same logic that gets the kind of people who were so excited about getting an extra $20 in their paycheck every two weeks after those tax cuts that Trump passed (only to find out that they got screwed on their tax returns... oops).

The truth is that many people in this country are too busy and don't have the time to consider the big picture of long-term economic benefits. If you're living paycheck to paycheck and the only thing between you and being homeless is the loss of one or two weeks' pay, you're pretty much programmed to take any crumb that you can get right now because the immediate danger of not being able to pay rent is WAY more tangible than the benefits of organizing and leveraging your power as a worker against whatever company you're working for.

I certainly felt this when I first joined my current retail job. When I saw that you had to pay money to be in a union, I was immediately skeptical. I was a right-leaning liberal back than. I didn't know then what I know now. And a lot of people who are much older than I am, who have been working for far longer than I have been, still don't know. And being in the middle of nowhere in the AZ desert doesn't help. It wasn't until I saw the union negotiate with the local division for a wage increase that I saw the benefit for being in one, however ineffectual it may be on the whole (especially compared to the unions of the early 20th century).

So trust me, the truth about membership dues ***absolutely needs*** to be emphasized to such a degree. Because right at the start of the video *he debunked the main reason most people don't want to join a union*. And that is ***very*** important."
