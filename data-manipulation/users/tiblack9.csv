You'll be trying to figure out the gaps and information that your professor leads you off with to complete things like assignments. Things like AP Lit, however, imo are a lot harder in hs than english in college lol."

ITCareerQuestions,ffbb705,t3_esnwsf,1579758228.0,"try seeing if your current internship can turn into a full time job; if it can then i'd just stick to it, as that is your ultimate goal. Internships are about building experience and $7 is a pretty big difference here. I'd take the new role tbh, the work that you do as an intern gets repetitive to a certain extent so staying there has no benefit here unless you absolutely know you can get hired full time."

PsychologicalTricks,ff7uop6,t3_es1j43,1579658794.0,"1. use smaller plates
2. use red colored plates/bowls as I believe that studies show you become more alert as to what/how much you're eating
3. eat fiber/a handful of any type of nuts before eating anything else; the fiber helps fill your stomach so you'll feel more full before starting your actual meal
4. chew slower"
cscareerquestions,ff58p2n,t1_ff4z45j,1579583554.0,"To add onto this, my statistics professor said that's why data scientist roles pays so much; multi-million/billion dollar companies would gladly be willing to pay out 200k-300k towards a data scientist's salary if that person is able to compute data and find efficient methods that save the company millions of dollars. It's really all about making the workflow more efficient/saving money."

cybersecurity,ff2aczp,t3_er8kyf,1579498577.0,"no; there's very few security internships to begin with, but companies are starting to dish out more internships in infosec understanding how important it is becoming. The main reason as to why I believe these internships aren't are virtual is due to the physical security and access of what you would be doing; I'd assume you'd have to be connected to a company's network before accessing any of their security tools, and doing so remotely seems pretty informal without ever physically meeting the company/employers (if you're a FT employee, you most likely just VPN in); you're essentially a stranger to them wanting to do work in such a high-profiled environment, so it makes sense as to why it's hard to trust an intern remotely in security; I've applied to 100+ cybersecurity internships and have yet to come across any virtual ones :/. Good luck!"

cybersecurity,ff1jbao,t3_er22an,1579480110.0,"a lot of companies just need someone who is capable of doing the job to fill the role; if they need to go out-of-state to find someone competent enough for the role then so be it; however, security is a profession where you really have to know what you're doing, hence the shortage of supply; therefore if you're open to relocation you need to provide some leverage as to why they would hire you over someone local per say."
computerscience,ff1ii51,t3_er1iua,1579479753.0,"your issue seems to be unclear; is the issue not knowing how to code in Java, or coding in general? If your issue is coding in java, then I wouldn't stress it. Languages really only differ through syntax, so you just need to practice using java. If you don't know how to code, however, that's where the problem lies. I'd stick with the course and see how it plays out. DS&A is a very important concept in coding, and if it's something you cannot perform decently/have a functioning resulting product in a language that you're familiar with then maybe coding isn't for you."

cscareerquestions,feid742,t1_fei20bl,1579135762.0,"yes, but then again, passing the interviews and knowing how to code is something you have to prove on both on paper to pass the resume screening and then the hacker ranks during interviewing."
ITCareerQuestions,fef0p34,t3_eoswm2,1579045436.0,"This really depends on 1. what do you already possess and 2. what are your career goals? If you did an undergrad degree in CS, a masters really won't do much unless it's specialized in something like ML/AI or Security. I'd only do the MS in Security if you're fairly confident that's your career choice. Security means you'd be working more in Information Technology, and other parts would be stuff like Data Analysis, ML/AI, Algorithms, and stuff a lot different from IT."
cscareerquestions,fef0e8k,t3_eoti8r,1579045239.0,"Tbh it probably does set you back, but this really depends on your region, competition, and the supply and demand of SWEs in your area; it's not that big of a deal, but to make up for it you have to showcase your ability to code whether it be through side projects, volunteering, extra curriculars, hackathons, etc."

But internships that expect you know how to code assume you know how to code without any resources. This is the purpose of hackerrranks: to test your knowledge of applying your knowledge rather than straight rote memorization or copying. You need to get out of your comfort zone and learn how to code things through googling/research and not be fed instructions step by step; it's a hard truth, but through my experience I've noticed this is what distinguishes employers from competent and incompetent programmers."
