interestingasfuck,ffrv9fk,t3_eus798,1580166623.0,"I had a nurse use that on me. Just a basic background. After my 3rd spine surgery, I was in the hospital room. Unfortunately I was given too much propofol and was having a huge reaction to it. If you ever felt sick with nausea, times that by 10. Everything was causing  me to vomit. Light, any slight movement or just taking a deep breath. On top of that, I get easily nauseous from pain medication.  So here I am, being nauseous from propofol and on top of that narcotic being pumped into me. Eventually I became extremely dehydrated and my original IV popped out during my vomiting session. Due to dehydration the nurses had real heart time finding a good vein. I was pricked approximately 20 times. Again me vomiting did not help the situation. Eventually the brought out the vein finder machine. One shot and they found a good vein. I recieved the much needed zofran for the nausea and IV for dehydration."

facepalm,ffqcjf5,t1_ffq8n2s,1580130339.0,"My cam is hardwired to be on 24/7. When the car is off you have couple of options to record. 
Bump mode will start recording as soon as the cam detects physical motion of the car. 
Optical motion if someone or something moves in front of the camera.
Low voltage recording. As long as the battery has enough juice it will record. Once the battery level drops to leta say 12.1 volts the cam stop recording until you start the car. By lowering the frame rate you can prolong the recording. I have it set at 5fps when the car is off. It records for 2-3 days while off. Mind you, my system has two cameras, it records through the rear windshield too."

Like for example, the McCormick is kosher certified and the other is not. Now to my understanding it's not cheap to get it certified.  Also any additional additives that's been added to keep the spices fresh. I once bought expensive and cheap bags of sugar. The cheap sugar hardened like a rock in few weeks, but the expensive one was still granular."
