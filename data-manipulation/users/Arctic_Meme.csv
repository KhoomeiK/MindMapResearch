teenagers,fcx3bfr,t3_ejcjqq,1578049378.0,"So, we have almost had nuclear war several times in the past 60 years. This time does not have me concerned on that front. Also, I doubt risks the continued existence of their nation to support Iran directly. They'll support them through means other than joining the war as a co-belligerent. Most of this is just fear mongering."

todayilearned,fcnu70i,t1_fcnsnqj,1577818494.0,"Ok if you sincerely think that people lived with everything effectively covered on shit and dirt, media has distorted your image of the pre modern life. First of all, average life expectancy if you lived past child berth was in the 60's, infant mortality plays a big role in pre modern life expectancy.
