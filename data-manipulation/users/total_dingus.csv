AmItheAsshole,ff8d12n,t3_es3p8q,1579673456.0,"Purely anecdotal, but I knew the truth about my dad when I was very very young, and I turned out fine. Just be there - that's usually enough. I'm grateful I had my whole life to understand my situation, and to make the careful choices to never succumb to addiction like he did. There's no perfect time. You did right."

kingcobrajfs,feojjgt,t1_feohq34,1579300969.0,"As someone who's seen him work and destroy/misuse everything he touches, that is a huge underestimate. There's absolutley no way to run out of paint at the rate he does when he only does one green wand every 2 months or whatever. That can should last him years. And he uses a dozen colors. He still gets a nice markup on just the raw materials, if you don't count the many hours spent on each one."
kingcobrajfs,feogl1h,t1_fenua91,1579299888.0,"How do you figure that markup? He spends copious amounts on paint that he oversprays with so he only gets like 2 wands per can, goes through 3 sanding discs per wand when he can just use regular sandpaper, loses money on shipping, buy bother baubles for the things...  Just wondering about that math."

kingcobrajfs,fe5oq8k,t3_ennpxq,1578872329.0,"Keeping the money he gained under false pretenses is legitimately illegal. It's fraud, and even if it isn't a huge amount, it's against the law, especially when a charity, real or otherwise, is involved. This wasn't just a lie among friends; this was a broadcast to 13,000 people. That has consequences. Arrest saga, Yootoobs?"

A month of periodic chatting doesn't entitle you to anything. You didn't pass the audition. Your resume wasn't a good fit. Don't place your self-worth in the hands of strangers and you will not have any of this total insanity you're spewing."
