facepalm,fcfl6kk,t1_fcehof2,1577631206.0,The mcchicken case is a good one. McDonald’s thought they could claim anything with the ‘mc’ prefix. The eu court limited protection to specific brands such as mcnuggets. A key reason is that in parts of the EU ‘Mc’ is a common start of a surname which is often used in trade.

Also, supermacs launched the opposition that led to this decision. This doesn’t necessarily mean they were the aggressor, but in court McDonald’s was defending."
facepalm,fcdu4hn,t1_fcc9hrf,1577613865.0,"Yes, apparently McDonalds lawyers somehow did not convincingly prove that McDonalds had used the Big Mac mark to market their products. If a mark is not used, there can be no customer confusion and the mark gets revoked due to non use. 

We all know that McDonald’s has used Big Mac to market their signature burger, so it all feels like a bit of a technicality!

However, it can be very difficult to submit new evidence to the court of appeal. The appeal should be based on facts and evidence from the lower court, to prevent uncertainty and escalating costs.

Therefore McDonald’s isn’t guaranteed to win on appeal."
