thisismylifenow,fe7c8p0,t1_fe7az0w,1578912683.0,"Oh yeah absolutely, it's all dependent on the situation and the people involved. I'm a cop, and I (likely!) wouldn't charge anybody in a situation like this, but that's assuming there's sufficient proof of a lack of intent. At least for my department, if there's no clear probable cause for a crime, we'll generally refer it to the DA's Office and let them make the final determination. Worst case in those scenarios is the suspect goes on their way that night and gets a warrant for their arrest. Better than forcing an arrest when one wouldn't be appropriate."
thisismylifenow,fe7agmh,t1_fe6smng,1578912056.0,"Ehhh, most criminal statutes for destruction of property/criminal mischief require that there be a criminal intent. I don't think being locked in a business would qualify, but it's obviously very situationally dependent. Like if you went on a rampage after 5 minutes breaking every window that's very different then breaking one small window to get out after being in there for several hours after trying to call the police/go through the correct channels."
AskReddit,fdu5xps,t1_fdtxw3b,1578728134.0,"Reddit tends to not be very cop friendly, and most (not all!) cops tend to be right leaning, so probably just not a conducive environment to it.  It's funny when people have posts asking questions for cops, you can pretty quickly tell that most of the top comments are not actually cops."
AskReddit,fdu5cj1,t1_fdu3vd8,1578727829.0,"Honestly evidence collection just generally suuucks, and tends to be boring and occasionally monotonous. It almost never is cool or exciting stuff. It's usually pretty typical crime related crap, guns, knives, drugs, or pretty mundane shit like rings that a burg suspect had on them that may have been stolen or stuff in that vein."
instantkarma,fdmu4aa,t1_fdmmrx3,1578565875.0,"Until you're running code at an astonishing 60 MPH and parts start rattling off and the car starts overheating. *Dear sarge, nobody was more surprised than I...*"
ProtectAndServe,fdbrq52,t1_fc6v5x6,1578261006.0,"I know this is super old, but I'm just now seeing it. 

We use the terms ""wrecker"" and ""hook"" interchangeably for tows. I was out of PTO for like a week and keyed up to ask for the ""next hooker on rotation, no preference"". Somehow literally nobody gave me any shit for it, but I still have to rehearse every time I ask for a hook."
IdiotsInCars,fcvu382,t1_fcvm6wq,1578010129.0,"Heyyyy welcome to literally every single call that we respond to lol. It doesn't matter if it's a homicide or a civil stand by, it's always emotionally charged and filled with people convinced they're right even when there is dick tons of physical evidence to the contrary. I mean, most people rarely call the police so I understand why it's like that, but it can get really old *really* fast."
HumansBeingBros,fcvtqv5,t1_fcvqlz7,1578009906.0,"Orrrrr he could just do what works for him? I mean 225 at that age especially is still pretty impressive, even if it's not full ROM. I know for me the stretch/rebound at the bottom if I'm doing TNG bench is easier then doing like spoto/board bench.

I've gotten to the point now where I still like to squat/bench/press, but I might not go ass to grass or full ROM every workout because of joint pain. Still gets me stronger, I'm just not as concerned with the technical side of the lift."
IdiotsInCars,fc6q5rt,t1_fc6phd0,1577486676.0,The vast majority of states have laws that give exceptions for using your cell phone to call 911 while driving.
ProtectAndServe,fblss7a,t1_fbag8nf,1576969338.0,"For what it's worth, most departments and BIs recognize that people aren't perfect and that everybody's made mistakes. As long as you can show that you recognized your error and have grown/worked to fix it, minor mistakes (like this one) will usually be pretty easily forgiven, just be prepared to explain what happened and why. Of course every department is different and your mileage may vary."
