Boxer,ffb8kh9,t1_ffb6jsx,1579755084.0,Wonderful of you to give him the best care that you can! Happy almost bday to the dude!
Pets,ffb7tbj,t3_esnay0,1579754294.0,"Regardless of the views on pet stores, you clearly do everything you can to get to know the needs and wants of each individual creature in your care, and it is awesome to hear! Keep up the wonderful work you are doing!"
rescuedogs,ff96y1l,t3_es9z05,1579706286.0,"This is so adorable! Teddy reminds me of my fav dog from the shelter I work at. Was with us for a year, finally adopted before holidays by a perfect lady and her perfect son! Anyway, sandbox and kiddie pools were his favorite!

Thanks for sharing your awesome boy! Wishing you love and fun for many years to come!"
Pets,ff7mjji,t1_ff7izsh,1579653120.0,"This was a great reply. Even without knowing more details of the situation, everything you said seems to fit well with what's going on. I feel it was a very logical perspective, and I appreciated it."
happy,ff7e7zl,t1_ff7aj0j,1579647509.0,"First of all, I am actually not sweaty right now. I do run hot so most times I glisten a bit, but it's cold out and I'ce had the door open. Did you mean sweety? Because that would have been so ""sweet"" of you. (Get the joke, neither of us meant the other was sweet?)

I was letting you know how you came across to me specifically, and I was wondering if that was how your comment, which has since been removed, was meant to be.

I still don't get what you mean by ""girl's gotta care themselves arite"". Are you saying all girls should primp the shit out of themselves? Not be okay with natural beauty? My point is...I DO NOT GET WHAT YOU ARE SAYING and it came across as a very negative comment to OP."
DetroitRedWings,ff7de86,t1_ff79lri,1579646964.0,"The stupid argument isn't necessarily the argument itself (I only watched the clip a couple times and quality wasn't great), the stupid part is that you are arguing this here. Guy hurts another guy. Hockey is a fast paced, physical game, shit happens. But you are posting this to a wings sub. What do you expect, people to be happy Mantha is hurt and not see Muzzin having any fault in it?

You are absolutely free to share your opinion on the matter, as am I. So I did. Just seems like the more the argument went on, the more pointless it got.

Why did I read it? Why am I commenting and responding? Because I am procrastinating real life right now. So thank you for the distraction!"
happy,ff79g6a,t1_ff76ro6,1579643832.0,"Was that supposed to come off as cynical and asshole-ish? Because it definitely came across that way to me. If that is the case, why even post? Are you trying to bring OP down? I don't get it.

What exactly are trying to say if you are not just posting this to be an ass?"
DetroitRedWings,ff78yan,t1_ff7715d,1579643468.0,"No. Just no. These are all opinions. And here, yours is in the minority. Go on leafs thread if you wanna throw a ""hooray for muzzin's hit that injured someone"" party.

Unless you are just here to argue. Then by all means, argue away. Have fun with it, I guess? I usually like arguing over hockey stuff, all in fun for the most part, but this is just a stupid fucking argument to ride on. At least pick something more debatable."
DetroitRedWings,ff78f5v,t1_ff77lqs,1579643162.0,"I feel AA has been overrated since his beginnings with the wings. I really just don't see him thriving with us. It's gotta be hard for the guys right now, but that's the game of hockey in NHL sometimes. I don't know exactly why I feel this way at this point, but I think it would better for him and better for the wings if they cut him loose and focused on others to help develop talent."
AmItheAsshole,ff6xt19,t1_ff6vfzk,1579637095.0,Oooooh this was a great reply. Well said.
AmItheAsshole,ff6xokj,t3_ervvgd,1579637022.0,"Don't know if it's been said in any comments already. But when people (like a family member of mine with several children varying widely in age) use the excuse that public schools expose children to drugs and pregnancy it is very laughable to me.

Side note: Private schools have just as much drug use and sex going on as public schools. 

As for homeschooled kids, i knew several homeschoolers growing up that made friends with the dropout druggies up the street, because they had free time during the day while the rest of us were in school and the younger sibs were doing school stuff with mom. But the druggies were there to hang with.

My cousin doesn't have that problem since they live in the middle of nowhere. But it is hard to see my cousin's kids growing up to be so naive about things and to be so far behind in terms of social maturity compared to other kids that are similar ages. What happens when these kids get out in the real world and are exposed to how the world really works?

I feel there are ways homeschooling can be done in a proper and beneficial manner, but I do not think that is the case the majority of the time. Plus, I was a very good student and had a good group of friends, but HATED school, especially high school. Despite the hard times, the lessons I learned helped me immensely, especially dealing with social situations, pressure, and the dynamics of living in the world."

OldSchoolCool,fd3eotq,t1_fd2gymy,1578157623.0,Yes! Would love to see it!
AmItheAsshole,fcz87cl,t1_fcz0nq1,1578095637.0,Had some drinks so I am bringing semantics into this. Don't females get SPAYED and males get neutered? Don't know why but it bothers my brain when they are swapped. Guess it could maybe be a regional thing? Idk.
nhl,fcyvcvz,t1_fcyqf7o,1578087890.0,"Well yeah...but we have 10 wins, so you know AHL vs NHL, we are doing pretty good..right? No? Lol

Still love em and always will, and at least bertuzzi is fun to watch! Plus, holland is out and Stevie Y is in...save us Stevie! I am willing to be patient and not riot because of this."
Pets,fcp9ug7,t1_fcp5z4h,1577855500.0,"Both are just super outdated ways of attempting to ""train"".

Puppy poops in house? THEIR fault! It is a BABY, they need to be taking it out regularly (every couple hours). they need to be supervising the puppy to try to catch it in the act, immediately take it outside, if dog finishes goong potty outside, praise and small treat or reward. Yelling, swatting, etc when catching pup going in the house is only going to make pup afraid to go in front of them. Rubbing the pup's face in it after the fact? Pointless! The poor dog has no fucking clue what they mean by that.

If I sound upset, well I am. You really dont seem to actually take it seriously that this is not helping the poor BABY animal and instead causing pain/fear/confusion. 
Tell them to try a basic google search for ""positive reinforcement training for puppies"". Please."

DetroitRedWings,fck4xal,t1_fck2tkz,1577716701.0,"I appreciated your post! Thanks for the positivity. I think it's cool you were interested to see what the general feeling was for us wings fans, and also your take on that feeling.

Hockey is a great game, and I love that MOST fans of other teams I meet are nice and easily engage in playful banter.

Thank you for sharing (and your name makes me want pringles really bad right now)!"
pitbulls,fck3wzu,t3_ehia4f,1577715849.0,What is this beautiful boy's name?
entitledparents,fck25cu,t1_fcjxhd3,1577714300.0,"The dad could have explained to his child that she is not the only one with that name, including animals. Not OPs fault either way. Also, if they were bothered by the name being called out, couldnt they move somewhere else in the park? I guess that would depend on size of the park. But still, guess it's a good time for dad to teach the kid it's gonna happen and she is going to have to learn to live with it."

dogs,fcirjp5,t3_ehdfiw,1577668123.0,"Does the dog have adequate shelter outside, is the dog fed regularly and have access to water? In the eyes of the law, that's good enough (assuming no abuse). I think it's shit. I agree with you. Why even have a dog?"
dogs,fcir5g5,t1_fcikswt,1577667847.0,"Omg i hate your cousin. Leaving a dog in crate, even one that's big enough, for that long because she ""forgets""? That is neglect.

They may not be able to do much, but they will have a record of having to check your cousin's situation out, or at least getting the complaint."
