Androidx86,feok6kz,t3_eo2ytz,1579301335.0,"This is one of many reasons why people stay away from Android x86 and Linux in general.

What I've learned is that you gotta create two partitions on a drive MANUALLY, 100MB of fat32 for grub, and rest as ext4.


Grub gets installed on fat32 100MB, Android on Ext4.

Why a user needs to do this manually is beyond comprehension, especially in a post-Windows 7 world.

MS took care of that, you select the ""drive"" to install Windows onto, and it creates all the little partitions that are needed for Windows.

We can sit here all day about how Android and Linux is for power users, but if the installation procedures are hostile and pure shit, you will only get the most hardcore tinkerers that will adopt and use it.

I'm not an amateur by any means, been using Linux for deving since 2000, but this was something that I saw throughout the entire Linux community.

Oh you got UEFI?  You gotta do x, y, and z to get it to work

Oh you need to format your drive?  Choose from Fat32, NTFS, or Ext4, where Android will only work on one of them, so choose wisely!

Shit like that, why are wrong choices that can make an install unsuccessful even presented as an option for the user?  Makes no fucking sense.

Let's add buttons and functions on a washing machine where if the user selects it, the wash will fail.  But we, as users, got more choices right?  More choices = More Freedom is one of the most naive notions of Freedom.
