If you want a giant iPad on your fridge door or in your kitchen, buy a giant iPad, figure out a mounting and charging solution, and put it in there. Then put less than $1000 in the fridge. The expensive ones use the same technology to keep food cold, and break down more frequently. The cheaper ones can last longer, and are cheaper to repair/replace.  

The coolest solution I've seen is a family bought a full size refrigerator and an matching full size freezer as two separate units, placed them next to each other with mirrored door hinges. Now if one fails, you can move things over ass temporary solution, or at least you only lose half the food. Oddly the particular models aren't as deep as other more basic older fridges, so there still isn't more room. I would have figured fridge manufacturers would at least made them deep enough to fit a full length casserole dish length wise into the depth."

American farmers are the biggest group of hypocrites in America, and I grew up on a farm. American farmers caused the dust bowl, it was government intervention, and academia and outreach programs that developed and taught the techniques to increase crop yields without killing the soil. Among the biggest forms of welfare are subsidizing different agriculture industries that form the voter base for some retarded Republican. Then those subsidies mostly go into the pocket of factory farms that output shitty, but reliable quality products, undercutting  and or outselling the products of small farmers at much larger scales. Incorrectly regulated markets force small family farms out of business. Or rich people by them as a tax right off. The best way to become a millionaire as a farmer is to start out as a billionaire.  Living out in the middle of no where, they're not exposed to very many different cultures, so they become insulated and isolated from new ideas.

What needs to happen is the FCC needs to expand requirements for fast reliable wired connections to rural communities and states and the fed invest in other infrastructural improvements to underpin incentives for new businesses in backwater places.

worldnews,fdqgxgy,t1_fdqe3c3,1578666391.0,"I think the point the guy is replying to is drones strikes as a capability were developed under Bush, and continued under Obama. A Republican successor to Bush would probably have undertaken about as many as Obama did, or would have sent American pilots into harm's way to achieve similar results. American foreign policy is largely fairly similar regardless of party in office. The precedent has been to continue international agreements even if not ratified as a treaty by Congress. It's why Obama campaigned on closing Gitmo, and it still operates today. 

As progressive as people think Obama was, I'm sure history will look back as see him to be fairly conservative side of moderate. His keystone Healthcare reform was a conservative version of a Republican implemented plan, he largely continued the foreign policies of his predecessor, and the laws and abilities to detain children and separate them arose during his tenure, even if he directed them to be otherwise. Meanwhile the economy ""recovery"" he spearheaded resulted in even greater concentration of wealth, and white nationalism saw rapid expansion in America, though that was more in response to him being black.

I say all this, and never voted Obama, but never voted Trump. Clinton would have been as bad or worse than Obama, but still better than Trump. Trump belongs to rot in jail for the rest of his life, and his and his entire family's and assosciates' assets seized as profits from criminal enterprise, so that any of his children, who dont go to jail with him, will have to start over from scratch, and really 'bootstrap' themselves.

More likely though part of it is the tax system. Every city with DART pays 1¢ out of the 2¢/ dollar sales tax the state allows them to raise. The cities that don't commit that portion of their tax, don't see Dart expansion, plus even if they did, they may not see expansion for years after they started paying.  Arlington itself underwrote the stadiums it hosts, but has yet to see a return on those investments, and never will. The DART cities already have underserved sections and areas, so increasing expenditure to benefit an area that hasn't committed to paying it off is kinda the problem. 

Now the recent Texas election ended the State Constitution to ban the raising of a state income tax, and there's already state laws limiting sales tax.

funny,fdla24v,t1_fdkoznn,1578519638.0,"I'm a big fan of 8, or better known as 7.5, but the problems with it are in context with its relationship within the trilogy. It's the only main Star wars movie to immediately follow the events of the previous. Because it starts with all the characters in the wrong place, they don't make sense. This is caused because EP 7 sets up a search for Luke as the next movie, then immediately resolves it by showing the meeting of Luke. If you wanted to include Luke in ep 7, just show him meditating on his island, or through flashbacks. Instead it sets up a meeting, that the next movie has to resolve. Leading to the flippant lightsaber, and the next scene with Luke showing him changing out of a white robe. Why was he wearing a white robe? Luke's response is fitting with his character and the universe. Yoda behaves similarly strange and funny when Luke meets him unknowingly in the swamp. His character is fed up with training kids who become monsters; >!they could even setup his paranoia of Kylo to be due to influence by Sidious, if only they had thought of that ahead of time!<

However, there's a failure between 7&8 being sequential in time and that is that events need to be setup between both movies to work. Consider Back to the Future. Events take place over a period of about 3-4 weeks for Marty. But each movie starts within a minute of the last ending. 2&3 work well together because they were filmed near each other, despite not needing to reuse locations, but 1&2 have some issues and storytelling. 1 sets up 2 to carry Marty's girlfriend into the future, and 2 immediately takes her out of the story because they can't think of what to do. Likewise, they couldn't get the actor back to play Marty's dad, and got sued for his likeness from cut scenes from 1. 1&2 could have worked better with recursive time loops. Just imagine seeing a second Marty in the background of 1. John Wick 1 similarly has issues with 2, but 3 is a little better. However, the character has also had a significant number of wounds after about a 3 weeks if these movies, and needs to reset before the next one. The best sequential sequel is probably Infinity War and End Game. It works because of the 5 year gap introduced 20 minutes in. It lets characters reset, breath, handwave growth between the timelines (professor hulk for example). They still manage to pull off a short respite between movies at the beginning, but they don't force characters to work from a defeated state.

With all the retcons of 9, 8 really just doesn't stand on its own anymore. Any major changes from 8 are retconned, so now it's a road trip to a desert with people dying. Abrams should have been in charge, or the studio should have had a better plan for the characters to ensure plot points were hit in each. 

>!With Episode 9, the entire trilogy of trilogies is setup around the central figure of Palpatine/Sidious instead of Vader/Skywalkers. I'm somewhat ok with this, but episodes 4&7 don't have him at all, and the entire thing really needs to be written to show hints of this across the movies. 1-3, 6,9 are the best examples of his arc, but more developement of his psyche  and motivations are needed in 1-3 for better payoff later !<"
funny,fdl6bq7,t1_fdl1ckw,1578517789.0,"No coincidence. Abrams is a bad writer. People need to stop expecting him to be good at writing. He's okay with a premise, and setting up shots (but enough with the lense flair) but he needs other writers to fix the plot and develop scenes. Lucas was the same way. Just look at the Credits Scroll in the Sequels: baaaad writing. RoS uses ""diabolical"" iirc. 

Abrams is also bad about transisitions in time. Hyperspace can still take days or weeks to get across Republic space. Ep 1,2,4,5,6 use travel to let characters and tension reset or build tensions as needed. Abrams makes it seem Luke is hiding on a moon orbiting in the same system of the rebellion. 

To be fair, I'm not a director or a writer, but if I had to to make millions of dollars, I'd go with something derivative to set up cool things, but forget to finish them on the back end. I can't claim to be better the Abrams. 

Its why I like ep 8: it pointed to something new, but also something familiar from the former EU, particularly KOTOR 2; though there are many problems with it. The director has since made ""Knives Out"" which has been well received, and a fun take on the mystery genre. Compare that to Abrams other works: Lost, 8mm and Star Trek reboot 1&2. The Star Treks in particular are fine spectacles, but terrible as Star Trek- very earth centric with little introspection. 8mm was an homage to classic Speilberg, but just wasn't as charming as anything Spielberg."

Similarly have two such election weekends per year, every six months. Make it illegal for any incumbent serving in office to campaign or raise funds for reelection, until 6 months before the next election they run, especially for federally elected persons like Congress, Senate, and President.

We may be able to chemically process trace amounts of some even. However nuclear processing and fuel creates non natural elements and nuclides for which we've never been exposed. Most notable is plutonium, a teaspoon of which is enough to chemically poison everyone in the US. It's decays and energy of particles is different than for other elements, for which there has been limited exposure in the natural world. Radiation damage in general really depends on the target location of the body, which dictate the likely interactions and relative elements. Method of exposure matters whether is external, internal- inhaled or digested. Internal sources are worse than external. Skin is fairly robust and regenerative given its typical exposure to UV radiation. In fact the topmost layers are dead skin which is a great defense of low external dosages. All that said radiation comes in 5 general flavours: alpha, beta, gamma, neutron and protons and larger charged nucli. Of these, neutron and gamma are neutral and interact through nuclear interactions and quantum mechanics, and interactions for causing harm is very dependent on relative energy levels between the target and the particle. It means they can pass through some material with relative easy, like an x-ray (a lower energy photon than a gamma typically) Charged particles by contrast can interact with the electron shells of colliding with atoms, and are more readily stopped. Your skin can shield from normal alpha emittors, your clothes can provide decent interaction for betas. Protons and heavier nuclie are rarer. The most dangerous are from particle accelerators and stellar events. You should know of you're in front of a proton beam (like in ghost busters) and it will kill you, and the magnetosphere protects from stellar events. 

Alpha particles will slow down and capture electrons from the environment to create helium, hence helium reserves are the result of alpha decays through history. Betas will slow down into positrons and electrons, positrons will annihilate with an environmental election to produce a pair of gammas, and the electron will be capture. Protons will slow down, capture an electron and form hydrogen, the most common element in the universe. Neutrons will beta decay to protons if they do not interact otherwise. Gammas are photons and will go until they run into something, they don't always have to run into something on earth. They can interact to excite electrons in atoms and molecules changing some chemistry. Also note anything with electrons can affect the chemistry of a environment."

As they slow down and interact and activate other particles who fall apart and change releasing energy, the energy causes everything to heat up tremendously causing a intense heat and pressure wave that carries radioactive particles. As the heated pressure wave expands, it causes destruction and can cause fires. The pressure wave will cool, as it expands, but it is an exanding wave that is still destructive. Finally with everything cooling, as responding flux of air will rush in to normal the pressure. The time scales involved are a matter of microseconds for the initial parts to seconds for the pressure wave. 

Now if you cut through say an onion, directly through the center, you'd get more of the inner onion layers and less of the pressure wave ratio wise. This is a ground burst. If you cut through the side of the onion, you don't really get the center as much, but you get ratio wise much more pressure wave. This is a low air burst like the US used for on Japan.  The atmosphere is relatively low density, so most of the nuclear active parts of the explosion will have less matter and less radioactive debris. At a high altitude bomb, you mostly get an ionic burst off the upper atmospher and maximize the EMP potential with limited fallout. A relaitive simple method for defending against a singular nuclear missile is launching other nukes to airburst near the path of the missile in the hope of damaging it or triggering an early detonation. High altitude over an ocean is relatively harmless. However such a strike will obscure any tracking of secondary launches."

It was a French Colony, and Hi Chi Minh was a freedom fighter trying to overthrow a colonial power. He thought the US would be in favor of that, but when they weren't receptive, because France is the oldest US Ally, he shifted to more communist support. Now he definitely did some shit things, everyone was doing them then and now. The problem with the French is they think French is the Pinnacle. The have a council of old dude who get to decide changes to the language. They expect any immigrant to accept the way of being French, and looked down on their colonies as inferior cultures. The French don't like American imperialism because it's just not French imperialism."
gadgets,fcc7rq2,t1_fcaujdj,1577595346.0,"Hello I agree with you. Some markets are great for capitalism. Think something like a farmer's market is a perfect example of capitalism that work. Other markets are terrible for capitalism, healthcare. For a farmer's market, if you don't want to pay the price for a carrot, you negotiate, or you find another vendor, or you go home with other vegetables, likewise the vendor can find other customers for their wares. Neither's life is in the balance when negotiating for a single transaction. Going to the ER, receiving cancer treatment, or getting help with a cold, the customer's life is at risk, they can't negotiate, they can't drive to the next vendor. Capitalism doesn't work. Something like delivering water to your house, rebuilding the infrastructure to each house is prohibitively expensive, so there is not potential for competitive vendors per household, this is not a market. Same forost infrastructure. Some infrastructure you can separate service costs from the actual physical infrastructure, like electricity, and internet. You pay a small fee for physical maintenance to the hub, but your ultimate resource provision and supply can be provided on a competitive market. It can work well, so long as there is competition, and not coordination. 

For those markets that are actually competive, I like the metaphor of a garden. In a garden the plants are competing for resources or are synergizing for resources however, if the rose bushes start overtaking the petunias, or the watermelons start crowding out the carrots and weeds are everywhere producing nothing, but taking up resources, it's not a good garden. Growing petunias in the winter I would think is useless, but there are plants that work better further into the autumn. Sometimes you have a spring harvest, and a different crop for er and autumn, so you remove the plants of one to make room for the other.Even a healthy market will see changes, and incumbent vendors may need to be ended to make room for New seasons of technology, culture, demands and whatnot. Some of this is driven by market demand, some of it though must be driven by a gardener defending the commons, ie government. Things like renewables over coal is a good example of preempting the marketplace to make sure there's enough growth for when it comes to harvest."
Jokes,fc7kson,t1_fc7iu31,1577510638.0,"Which studio released it? By releasing it this year, they can claim loses for this year, and use the losses to cancel profits for up to the next 5-10 years depending on tax codes. If they studio green lit and expected to make some big movies the next few years it could work out. Plus if they can get an award winning director for half price on his next movies, not to mention the stars involved in this it can save them money. Think about if Idris Elba is set to play some blockbuster and they can use this to reduce his residuals on a future negotiation, same for Dame Judi Dench or Sir Ian McKellen etc. Maybe the movie original pitched was something different but used similar technique or technology and someone shifted it to Cats to get more marketing power, and the end result was the dramatic remake of Samurai Pizza Cats is forever left in the dust, where in alternate dimensions it will become bigger than the avengers, all because Joe forgot to stock the bagels at the coffee shop and some executive didn't get his full carb for breakfast and was to involved at the meeting. Damn you Joe and your attempts to thwart Samurai Pizza Cats. You may have won in this dimension, but I'll beat you yet!"

Both fall under cognitive biases. Your brain, my brain, everyone's brain is lazy. It doesn't like to think. It creates shortcuts to remember things, similar to scripts instead of manually manipulating date repetively. Some of these are good: be more careful around high places, be apprehensive of venomous animals like snakes and spiders. Some of them were once useful, now theyre not. In-group and outgroup biases, or and similarly tribalism are one of these. For Hunter gatherers, people who don't belong to your tribe may seek your harm for their benefit. People who appear very different may have greater harm. People within your group have nuanced personalities, have situational responses, while people outside your group conform to a single personality that reflects their unalterable attributes. This difference means people outside the group are not the same level of human as inside the group. This is harmful today as the culture at large at least pays lip service to the idea of equality for all humans. It fails spectacularly when describing the opposing political views, or maybe some underclass like criminals, or Floridaman. Now I certainly agree Trump I bad for America, the world, and should be removed from office and criminally prosecuted, with any remaining wealth confiscated from himself and heirs and associates as profits from criminal enterprise, his current wife and her family should be deported for criminal participation, and his remaining minor child should go into foster care, while his adult children should face prosecution for at least criminal conspiracy, and all their wealth also seized. I think any property bearing the name of Trump should be seized in interest of the the public trust and either converted to public use or sold at the highest price with the proceeds to go to the local government, wherever said property in the world exists. But he's a con artist and there's millions of victims in the world right now who have borne the brunt of his cons and who are still the mark falling for the con. Both groups are still victims though, how you handle each is different."

The response has been for Billy Graham's son to claim his father voted for Trump, and many people have come out against the paper. To some of these people Trump is appointed by God, the irony is that he's a punishment for their greed, their sins, their idolatry, and they are too foolish to see."
