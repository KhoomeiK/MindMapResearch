dogs,fepa3jc,t1_fep367z,1579315543.0,Absolutely! My ex was key in their development. And now I dont have him as a resource. I have been researching possible grants but haven't had any solid leads as of yet. Thanks for the curiosity.
dogs,fep2nvl,t1_fencmqj,1579310774.0,"My ex-husband & I trained my SDs. I would never be able to afford one otherwise. A professionally trained SD can cost upwards of $15,000. I am going to need a new one very soon & am in a bit of a pickle as my co-trainer is now my ex! But each dog was in training for a good 3 years before I felt confident in them having all the tools needed. Not any dog can be a SD. Most flunk out of training. If done correctly it is a very extensive process."
dogs,fep1nry,t3_eq28nv,1579310139.0,"Being a person with a service dog, I cannot fathom entering public with the animal in the video at all! I have always had multiple dogs, pets & my SD. When he is needed or his vest goes on he is all business. But I deal with so much crap from the public who bark, whistle or attempt to distract him from his duties. I even had one crazy lady in a grocery store scream at me how dogs are dirty & dragging them into public is cruel & goes against God. Yeah really. My Hunter is a pro tho. He just ignores them. He is better at it than me. I wish more programs educated people on how to deal with a SD in public. My life would be so much easier!"
Ghosts,fdfwfbb,t3_ekzzso,1578372044.0,Wow. 100% I couldn't have that dress form in the corner. I would piss myself every damn time I walked into that room
horror,fbvzsg9,t3_eei7nz,1577138460.0,Umm... MEEE!
