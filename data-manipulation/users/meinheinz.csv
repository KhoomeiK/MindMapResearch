gaybros,fftkl2b,t3_ev1lmz,1580222970.0,"I'm happy you got married but why is this your favourite photo? It looks kinda bad.

Edit: Sorry I didn't mean to be horrible but I just meant you don't look close together and you can't see much of both of you. Beautiful scenery though."
science,fftkfur,t1_fftiz5b,1580222866.0,I highly recommend you get off your high horse and actually provide facts for what you're saying on a fucking science sub!
worldnews,fftfgd1,t1_ffsuk4i,1580219018.0,">If you self-quarantine,

What if you only have temporary accommodation and can't afford a long hotel stay? Do you quarantine yourself on the street?"
science,fftb6dk,t1_ffsdnsh,1580215126.0,Can you provide a source for this. This seems farfetched.
science,fftaz8q,t1_ffs5vwe,1580214929.0,That's the thing. You don't know your partner is always monogamous. You can't trust people with your health(well I guess your trusting the doctor) so it's good to always look after yourself.
askgaybros,fft3mpj,t3_ev0llh,1580205318.0,I've never understood how siblings can get on so well. Me and my sister hardly say a kind word about each other..I actually can't remember if either of us ever has.
askgaybros,ffsb6bd,t3_euwcow,1580177553.0,"Yes, my dad taught me to do it so it keeps your penis cleaner."
askgaybros,ffsaz75,t3_euwjz7,1580177422.0,"People lusting after your body is a better accomplishment than lusting after your face. A handsome face requires nothing but good genetics. A good body shows a knowledge of fitness, nutrition and restraint/discipline in a world filled with yummy junk food. 

Also once your personality starts to shine through, you will find people will look past the features people may find not typically beautiful (decent non-shallow gays)."
IncelTears,ffsa9vh,t1_ffr15ha,1580176949.0,Why is everyone assuming the guy in the meme made the incel comment below? Or am I getting the wrong end of the stick.
IncelTears,ffsa6dh,t3_eurllm,1580176885.0,The guy on the right is only 20. He's from a reality show called Love Island. He also looks much older than 20 to be honest.
unitedkingdom,ffrzz17,t1_ffnp0ou,1580169794.0,"The problem is when you target one race you can end up harassing decent members of the community too. Knowing I could get stop and searched every time I walk out the house because of the colour of my skin, would turn anyone's attitude to the police a bit sour. You could say its for the greater good but feeling like every police officer views you as a criminal is a shit thing to feel!"
unitedkingdom,ffry2k4,t1_ffq0hw6,1580168510.0,That makes zero sense to me. Can you explain further?
unitedkingdom,ffrwhhp,t1_ffrt589,1580167440.0,It's both. If you enacted this proposal it would happen regardless unless you want more heavy handing policing of immigrants.
unitedkingdom,ffrw081,t1_ffqg7mh,1580167118.0,How do people not love IKEA.
CasualUK,ffqw72x,t3_eum7xx,1580145028.0,Never seen this in London although we're apparently riddled with crime. Never seen someone try and attack the staff on a night out..they just try and attack each other.
gaybros,ffqut51,t1_ffqs0pf,1580144132.0,I'd rather be a free man but that's just me.
unitedkingdom,ffqtzdn,t1_ffqbl4f,1580143596.0,Some 1984 bullshit.
television,ffqsn9k,t1_ffqqz22,1580142721.0,"Ok I made a mistake, no need to get so angry."
television,ffqhnn5,t1_ffqgu9g,1580134866.0,Just strange how Reddit is outraged by this but not all the other garbage pseudoscience that is promoted by Netlix.
askgaybros,ffqcx62,t1_ffqc9js,1580130716.0,It was unecesssary and you know it. Unless he was sticking unused needles in people others should take responsibility for having sex with strangers without a condom.
CasualUK,ffqctb8,t1_ffqc3hc,1580130612.0,"True, some people live off a high sugar diet at an acceptable weight. They are much less likely to get diabetes than an obese person."

CasualUK,ffqbsnv,t1_ffq4x6x,1580129597.0,Just a reminder. Being overweight is a bigger risk factor for diabetes than sugar intake!
