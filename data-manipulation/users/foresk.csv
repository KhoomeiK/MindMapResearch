offmychest,ffjmkym,t3_etpfhc,1580001720.0,"I know it isn't an AMA but I had some questions, feel free to answer if you'd like:

At your height of your active nymphomania, did you still have standards for partners/certain types of guys, or could it have been literally any human with a functioning dick? 

Approximately how long did it take for you to go from alone to in bed with a total stranger, when you were really in the mood?

How do you feel about men who deem themselves niceguys/MGTOW/incels?"
offmychest,ffejwep,t3_esvocw,1579851068.0,"I can’t relate to you on the abusive relationship per say, but I can relate to feeling shitty about how far backwards I’ve slid because Of not letting go destructive things (drugs) and I needed to hear that someone else is going through this rebuild. Thank you"
offmychest,ff3qusc,t3_ercz19,1579546885.0,"you are definitely on the spectrum, nothing wrong with that man I wish i was bi so I could get more causal sex. I tried to get a guy to blow me when I was really drunk and I just couldnt finish because it was too weird for me. I am too straight :( lol I could have never complained about this 20+ years ago"
LadiesAndSmallCocks,few7608,t3_eqo1kc,1579406293.0,your cock looks exactly like the first 4.5 inches of mine. Tbh I wish mine was like yours so girls could take all of me for blowjobs and I dont have to worry about hurting them in sex. Since your cock looks like mine I know you have good girth
EngineeringStudents,fem0uay,t3_epq3dk,1579236130.0,"quite the opposite actually, i am really only doing this field because I like the people involved. Very intelligent, chill, interesting and engaging people. So much better than the idiots I was working with at my dead-end minimum wage jobs who were basically on a pre-recorded loop that played every 4 hours due to the same exact conversations and drama, and the worst part was the blank stare they would give you if you brought up any kind of subject matter that wasn't already programmed into their lines of code. It was so dull that I would have to get really high to deal with the shift and thats exactly what I can't be doing anymore. 

(Most) engineers actually have personality, from what it sounds like you are assuming that they will always be the 19 yr old honors college dorm pizza party kind of people but that is because yes, they are 19 and immature. Give it some time."
paag,fecfa64,t3_eo79qy,1578972529.0,well i guess RIP curseoflillith :(
SmallCockWorship,fecexnn,t3_eodz3i,1578972296.0,damn your wife is hot. how many inches of fun can you give her?
pencildick,febccqd,t3_eob2z2,1578957426.0,no that looks rather large honestly. you look like you could really fuck a girl hard with that tool. theres no way its only 4 inches girth that looks like at least 4.75
gothsluts,fe6fkrn,t3_e7nvli,1578889402.0,i think you are much cuter without the eye makeup stuff tbh. It makes you look kinda like a drag queen or something much older than you actually are and you are beautiful all on your own
audioengineering,fdpm6w4,t1_fdntfv3,1578632559.0,"In my opinion Moving Pictures was best mixed and highest fidelity album, ever, when it came out (1980). The mix sounds SO CLEAR AND SO GOOD. It is still one of the best sounding albums today. I don't understand how such an amazing recording studio with incredible talented engineers can go away :("
