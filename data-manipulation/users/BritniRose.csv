velvethippos,ffey03o,t1_ffdyfoq,1579869946.0,"Probably the worst 4 days of my 28 years on this planet. Emergency vet on a Sunday, transfer to his vet on Monday, Tuesday they were 50/50 odds of survival, the lil shit rallied and was home on Wednesday. Chocolate labs are something remarkable, I swear. The vet said he survived through sheer stubbornness and bravery, basically. He came out to the waiting room and said “you don’t like him very much, do you?” ...I may or may not have called every hour on the hour to check on him. When he got home, I had to feed and medicate him every two hours, and his survival was dependent on me. Absolutely terrified me yet made us even closer, somehow.

He is my absolute everything. Now he’s fine, snoring on my leg and I can’t feel my leg anymore but no way in hell am I going to bother him."

He’s soooo stubborn, the only way it worked was because he was too weak to fight me!"
