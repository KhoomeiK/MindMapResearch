Respect and appreciate what they are offering. Try to fit into their operation. Treat them like you are a human being, and they are human beings, and this is a thing you guys are doing to make money... don't be insane or weird... don't ask generic fucking questions? that's a great way to not get hired. Ask about things that make sense... Another thought. listen to what *they* say. Demonstrate listening skills... These are the things you ought to be doing at this stage... You don't like how the job is? ... Apply to *another* job. Ok i'm out to play a game with my last day of freedom."

Bitcoin,ffr3x3a,t1_ffqm6rm,1580149913.0,"funnily enough i feel this explanation leaves out the actual ""money"" in the conversation. Money is an illusion... it literally would be worthless if everybody in the world decided their stuff was suddenly more valuable and didn't want to trade it for an exchangeable.. nothing has any value except the value we put on it, the value of how difficult/rare, an object (or service, or our time).. is.  and in truth even that has only an abstract value(as it stands clear that over time our values have changed.. and so proving that our previous values were inadequate/inaccurate to our actual(potential) needs)

.. and so in truth this whole conversation isn't about ""money"" or ""value"" it is about our strategies for distributing and accounting for said value.

i would propose that the vast majority of wealth is currently held.. earned... in previous era's. technology previously invented, implemented, and almost always made entirely to benefit *the majority*. and yet we live in a world where that value is not only hoarded and often regarded as owned by a select few.. but in fact when you think about the creation of nearly *anything* the value was often made entirely by the effort, creativity, and persistence of just ordinary workers. working for a menial wage. your great grandfather working for the pipeline that allowed the ships to sail from the great columbia for the past 100 years... the same ships that distributed the goods that spurred on the great american economy and allowed the massive industry that popped up in china in the past few years... that fleet has moved incredible wealth and numerous fortunes.. but in truth that value... where did it come from? who owes their success to whom?

the truth is bitcoin is just another tool to allow the exchange of value and it is no better than we make it.  the true value of a currency is not how efficient it is, but how clearly it reflects the value that exists; how functional it is in moving it."
