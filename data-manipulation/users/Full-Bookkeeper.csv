That’s why I keep deleting Reddit accounts and making new ones in case someone I know sees this and recognizes me, which is crazy I know. I also feel like when I’m sitting in the car on my phone, people can see what I’m doing so I can’t even use it."

I tried really really hard to make friends in the beginning and I did, but my anxiety told me they all hate me secretly so I pushed them away. Understandably, they don’t make an effort to talk to me much anymore and I feel like all my hard work has gone down the drain. I’m just at an all time low and have no one to talk to :,("
