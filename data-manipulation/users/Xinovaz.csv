Astroneer,fdcovbo,t1_fdcgd3d,1578280307.0,"i’m not so sure the planets are procedurally generated. someone correct me if i’m wrong, but i think they’re all the same in each save. as for modding, i’d say there’s a chance somewhere a bit below 50-50. the dedicated server update is coming out really soon, probably this month! with that, maybe (hopefully) plugins will be available, and maybe mods to boot! i, personally, like the game the way it is. it’s nearly everything i want in a space game. the only things mods would add is some base-building items. in my opinion, i think a space station, whether it be modular or just an item, would be really cool."
Astroneer,fdbcx3l,t3_ekcw20,1578256149.0,"Another solar system? No. A bigger ship, however, may be in the dev roadmap. They’ve got a lot of kinks to smooth out, so to answer your question of how long they’ll be developing, another few months at the least. Hope that helps."
