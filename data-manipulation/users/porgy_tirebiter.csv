The overall population is declining as people aren’t having kids. I’d suggest a few things: the average age is much higher, meaning a huge percentage of the population is now retired and no longer suffering from the insane pressure of work. In addition, the kids have significantly reduced competition to enter a good high school or university, and graduates have reduced competition for positions at big companies. These life gateways create huge social pressure in Japan, and an easing in that pressure could be reducing suicides.

As a teacher at a prestigious private school, my own anecdotal experience is that the kids I teach have been steadily declining in academic ability coming in, which suggests to me the school can’t be as picky as they were in the past.
