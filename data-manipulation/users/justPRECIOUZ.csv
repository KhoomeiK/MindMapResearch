InPursuitOfClarity,fee3bb0,t3_eo2vgy,1579025521.0,"I guess you should categorize those three topics in these kind of form :
 A. Gratitude - what you're grateful for in your well being, your parenthood , and marriage, maybe you're grateful for your birthday, you just clocked a new year. 
B. Plans - Your future plans for these three topics. Maybe saving up college funds for the kids
C - your present happy& Sad Experience on these three topics; maybe your wife promotion/ a little dispute with your kids. Stuffs like that. Having those three Categories will help you love and crave journaling even more. And try to keep it as low as a page a day. So that it'll not Become a chore, but rather an Hobby that you'll crave each day. Feel free to give us feedbacks if you do try this out.

selfhelp,fee1gbo,t3_eoih6h,1579024409.0,"Wow wow wow. This is really insightful. Thanks a lot. I just finished reading "" The 5am Club"" and the book was situated on a billionaire that gave out his time to mentor two strangers that he met in a seminar. He gave them world class experience in travel, finance, food, knowledge. And he only demanded that they also spread the message he just taught them to someone else. Own your time, then give it out to help others. Just as this person just did. A great lesson to take today. Thank you Zhichong. #JustPreciouzCares"

So you watching it even though you know him before just makes you remember why you always come back to watch his Videos weekly. I put time and effort into making this videos too... And I'm not just spamming links and bringing irrelevant videos to the community. At least a few people got to talk about what they like and don't like about him due to this post. Thank you."

selfimprovement,fdn8vrc,t3_elzuo1,1578580398.0,"A lot of great advice has been given here... But the one I resonate with the most and you should too is there's time for improvement, don't rush yourself, learn that it's all a journey, and there's highs and lows ,but you're making progress and growing. Don't give up on your company , keep building, keep going, it'll all be worth it at the end.  You just might be the next Mark Zuck/ Bill Gates, so why stop now)"

selfimprovement,fdn7acs,t3_em7hvr,1578579232.0,"I really wish I could send a Voice memo.. But I'll type:
Start with small wins... don't force yourself to finish a book, when you know you're not yet at that level or capacity, start with finishing a few YouTube Video on self Improvement (Great channels: Nathaniel Drew,Matt d avella , Thomas Frank, Better Ideas). Then take little steps . maybe make yourself Journal for Two days , after you're done count that as a win in your Book of wins, then move to the next, Maybe Run for 10 minutes for two  days also. This small wins help build you for bigger wins, and then in the long run you'll be able to stick to a bigger goal and conquer that. So don't get mad at yourself for not being able to stick to something for long! Start small, there's time. 
And make sure you watch self improvement contents, they really do help. I hope this was helpful.
