FloridaMan,ffj8uns,t1_ffj6y6r,1579993192.0,Maybe don't look at a home as an investment but a home. You don't buy a car thinking of resale value.
PrequelMemes,ffeor0x,t1_ffensbj,1579857805.0,"Sound's like a self-made problem then. Marvel is more inspired by the comics then based on them, I'm sure Star Wars could do the same."
PrequelMemes,ffelpa4,t1_ffeenma,1579853396.0,Do you really think he read everything he signed off on? I don't know a single Star Wars fan that's read all of it there is just to much and even someone with no life couldn't do it.
PrequelMemes,ffelmw6,t1_ffehl32,1579853306.0,"I'd say more of the problem is Kathleen Kennedy saying that there is no source material to pull from to make more Star Wars films like they did with marvel, while ignoring the mountain range of EU they burned."

AskReddit,ffbgk4c,t1_ffafivm,1579764329.0,That sounds like  pretty sweet deal. I'd use that nowadays with how restricted streaming has become.

youtubehaiku,ffa5p6t,t1_ff94tjj,1579728390.0,"Actually pornhub is owned by the largest adult streaming conglomerate. Mindgeek, they own pornhub, Youporn, Redtube, Xhamster, Xvids, babes.com, Reality Kings, mofos, men.com, Extremetube, spankwire, brazzars, digital playground, twistts and a ton of other studios. In fact many people say they have a monopoly on the online adult film business."
youtubehaiku,ff8rs5v,t1_ff8pwde,1579693522.0,Pornhub really should swoop in and make a sfw videostreaming site. All of Google is a freaking mess nowadays.
