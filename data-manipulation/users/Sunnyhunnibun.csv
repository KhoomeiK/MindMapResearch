dragonage,ffcsmwg,t1_ffcsb4u,1579806434.0,"Ha! Isn't that true? The person in question in DA:O would hold their head, FLASH, then a demon. It was all...quite mysterious despite us having to then go into the Fade to deal with everything. And fair fair, there is a lot of mystery surround...hell all magic mages use but it was done so in a purposeful manner. Like too much detail may take away from the story. And...I believe he was the son...of someone important. I know exactly who you're talking about tho!"
dragonage,ffcrd7n,t1_ffcq65x,1579805675.0,"Yes but Anders does show what happens if possession, even a willing consensual one, can do to a mage if their emotions take over. Thats why I lump them together as showing that example. A part of me wonders though if mages are actually much more common than people think but they 'hide' their power. Much like Bethany did and Malcolm was thought to. We find out that's one big lie but if mages know they'll get sent to circles, do you think there's patches of them hiding within Thedas. And the Inquisition and whole 'hole torn in the sky with only one savior' kinds of lends to the fact that, yeah, we don't have time to hurt people when fade cracks open up and drop villains in.

Agreed, I think the DLCs did help to fill out a lot of questions and there may have been a requirement to get it out. It's why I like that the teams talk to people a lot on Twitter. To help answer questions and fill in blanks. But yeeeeah, the whole Divine ending...I wish there was just a small Mass Effect blip where you can read exactly what went down."
dragonage,ffcp7jp,t1_ffcngj8,1579804264.0,"I agree...Anders whole situation breaks my heart and true, he isn't just Anders but that possession is in part due to the fact he is a mage...and to the fact the Chantry hurt that man something awful. 

I just think that the series presented us with two companions that are 'exceptions' but they fall directly into this mages may not be safe with their own power rhetoric. It does a great job of trying to speak about this insanely powerful, yet still oppressed minority. I just think with the companions they have given us, hell we can kind of toss Morrigan in there for her forbidden Fade magic child (the kid gives me the biggest creeps) and performing pretty abominable acts...Dorian too for his lackadaisical response to blood magic use. 

I kind of wish in the DLCs they actually explored this with the different Divine's. There's a brief statement on it...and then they're done. Like I feel like the game missed a chance there to pull something where your conversations with Vivienne did sway her to make xyz changes to the Chantry or Cassandra or Leliana. It leaves us a lot of 'well...what happened?' when they explicitly show they're in power and you still live in the land. 

And I'm perfectly okay with that...I just don't know if Leliana or Cassandra honestly would be the Divine to do that...Cassandra less so tho"
dragonage,ffcm0ev,t1_ffckvtf,1579802302.0,"Yeeeah, that DLC stabs ya straight i nthe heart. It's really good though, a great ending to the story, a lot better than the actual end imo. Blackwall is trying to atone but trying to atone while still lying...is still lying. It was for his personal benefit because he never wanted anyone to find out he had committed a crime and to stay out of jail...but he lies and that is super complex about the storyline. Like I appreciate it, but still he lies. 

See, I like the College of Mages idea, I really do. But with the infighting amongst the mages as well as their lack of a solid leader....it makes the idea seem lofty. It'd be better if that middle ground was a College of Mages with a elected leader that is overseen by chosen assets by the Divine. Because what happens when there are fractures in the College? Rebellious groups rise up, hellbent on revenge? Well...the mages will handle it unless they can't and then there's a mage army ready to wreck havoc. 

And I'm sorry, I cracked up because I just thought of the Mulaney bit, 'She is a bitch and I like her so much!'"
dragonage,ffcl32i,t1_ffciu24,1579801747.0,"\[So sidebar, even though we have opposing views, this is the best convo I've had about DA lore in a long while and appreciate your participation!\]

So I disagree that the rite is completely abhorrent because there were those that volunteered for the right as well and...there are dangers, primarily like Anders, who honestly speaking...need to either be killed or made Tranquil. While we understand the motives of his actions...he did kind of murder an entire Chantry which is way more than just the people that hurt him. 

My apologies for the misunderstanding about the power comment. And honestly, in 90% of my playthroughs, I side with the mages as well. I take a pro-mage stance but want one that is...a mix of Leliana and Vivienne. You are right, Vivienne definitely had a sheltered life, to begin with, but once she was allowed to travel to Orlais and became a player in the games, all sheltering was out the window. I think you're right on needing to see other chantry's but I believe as Divine, she would actually be able to do this. I agree a top down change needs to fundamentally be made for the Chantry although personally if it were disbanded, that wouldn't be horrible either. 

The lore itself directly states that mages are more susceptible to demonic possession and corruption as well as becoming abominations, even after death. It's not just a belief in the Circles, it's one held by the Dalish and the Qunari, both who have methods for 'kind of curing' it. If you look at mages like Merrill you can see how disgusted they were by her use of not only blood magic but working with a demon and potentially exposing herself to possession. Like, she had no reason to *have* to learn this and go against her Keeper. Yes they're their own beast but they acknowledge the dangers of possession and blood magic and the dangers of the Fade as well.

Well I do agree complete freedom or complete ownership is not an option that would work either way. A balance needs to be struck but there are people who hold vast more power than non-magical beings. While a lack of morality is a huge piece, we can't ignore that untrained, unlimited power in the hands of anyone can be dangerous. Even if it isn't malicious"
dragonage,ffcidlh,t1_ffcgi11,1579800109.0,"Oh no I totally get that and I do appreciate you knowing she is a well-rounded character. But Iron Bull's opinions towards mages and Tal-Vashoth are strikingly similar to Vivienne's. If you kill the Chargers and get to the DLC, you end up learning the entirety of his presence was a giant con game. He betrays you and ultimately screws you over but thanks you for helping the Qunari in the long run. If anything, that's much worse than Vivienne's meddling. Sera literally flips shit any time you do anything ever so slightly preferential to mages and Blackwall literally sits on a throne of lies and while he's not as silver tongued in getting you to do things, he is still ultimately having you do tasks for him under a false pretense. 

And you are correct about her stance being close-minded and biased but honestly, the viewpoints of just shut down all Circles is just as close-minded too. There needs to be a middle ground but honestly the game doesn't allow for great explorations of middle for a lot of issues. I think I get hung up on the word bitch cuz usually it's used in a way where the person is either irredeemable in their viewpoints or completely illogical in them and she's just making things difficult. Which Vivienne doesn't do in my opinion. She's extremely headstrong, she's very opinionated, she has no issue stating it. But bitch just doesn't seem fair when held against others, they're quite similar just more tight lipped."
dragonage,ffcgojo,t1_ffcflgf,1579799068.0,"Vivienne doesn't just want more power for herself in a vacuum though. She grew up in the Circle and was luckily raised in one of the good ones. She wants reform to the Circles, she doesn't want to see them being abused and made Tranquil and stated in game that that kind of behavior was abhorrent. Her grasp for power isn't just a grab at it, she wants to better the life of Circle mages while requiring that Circles still be a thing. Which honestly, isn't a bad idea especially after you see how susceptible they are to possession and corruption. The main issue is the complete lack of morals and sympathy by the Chantry as a whole...which Vivienne looks to fix by becoming the Divine. 

And technically speaking we have multiple examples of free mages if you use the elves as an example. Dalish elven mages are only so good at what they do because...just like in the Circle, they are trained by the head of their village and a close eye is kept over them. If there are too many mages in a clan, they again will spread you out amongst others. Technically tho, since they aren't in a Circle, they are free. But like the most ancient race of magic users, sans Dwarves...poor Dwarves, literally practices these safety precautions too."
dragonage,ffcf9y0,t1_ffcepew,1579798206.0,"I don't think she's anymore a bitch that Leliana or Morrigan, two people who are just as conniving, both try to trick the player character into doing things they want and one is just a cold and if not moreso rude than Vivienne ever is. I don't think it's right to call her a bitch because, unless you build up a negative relationship, she is never doing these things in any more a malicious manner than anyone else that is trying to deceive you into doing their bidding. Literally, save for like Varric and Sera...everyone in the game is trying to get something for you. Vivienne is just way more blunt than most. If she's a conniving bitch then so are half the companions throughout the series."
dragonage,ffcdtzc,t1_ffcdhek,1579797317.0,"Agreed, like Vivienne would be a perfect person to lead Circle reform. We don't need to abolish Circles, we need to make them decent livable places so mages aren't even more susceptible to falling to temptation. Like, DA:O showed us time and time and time again how easy it was for a mage to fall to corruption if they were in an emotionally charged/distraught state. She wants to correct and fix that without literally sending all these people with varying levels of power out into the world. Like she is known for traveling AND for being respected. She could easily pass these values on but...people would rather be mad at her for not subscribing to 'free all mages' when she knows how that won't work"
dragonage,ffc75jd,t1_ffc5u59,1579793095.0,"Exactly! It makes me so sad when people dislike her for reasons of 'well she's rude and cold and doesn't understand the mage struggle'. And it's like PLEASE BRING HER ALONG IN YOUR PARTY. I promise, she will have so much commentary to share and will show you that she isn't any of those notions. Like, she is a character raised in the Circles and then thrust into 'the game' in Orlais. She has had to endure so much and as such sculpted each of her actions and reactions to never mess up the game. She's so well-written and when you see little cracks in the serious facade they're so worth it"

dragonage,ffc0v4i,t3_esqdp1,1579788673.0,"My unpopular opinion is that Vivienne was a well-written, likable character and a lot of people that didn't like her usually refused to look into the character's background. Like I play a Dwarven Inquisitor, her opinions on how mages should be treated or handled is more informed than hers could ever be and it gives a nuanced approach. Plus, when you have her in your party, she's sharp and witty but has no issue making jokes too. Dorian and her in a party...hilarity pure hilarity. Plus, she is deeply caring about all of your companions...even if she shows it in an odd sort of way. She recommends etiquette and manners but only because she knows what kind of status they're bringing, actually jokes with Sera and Bull and...she's just so nice in her own Vivi way.

Alaska's law is interesting too. Colorado says no one is as fault if it was accidental. But yeah, it varies a lot"

In middle school, I represented the Army chapter of the 4-H. My mom informed the school and all my teachers that I would be going away to a 4-H conference for a week and I was given a waiver for my school work for my time away. I had a great time, met a lot of people from all over the country, spoke to Congress and all in all loved the hell out of it. When I got back, every single one of my teachers was cool with it save for one. I called her Ms. Mustache...cuz well she had a mustache. 

Well, when I got back Ms. Mustache said I missed a pop quiz, homework, a lab and class participation and as such I would not be allowed to go on the class field trip and I was probably going to fail that quarter. I'm a goody two shoes, so I immediately begin to hyperventilate and cry and try and explain that my mom handled this and that I was supposed to be waived. She said she didn't care, I had better stop crying or I would get a referral. So...I start crying harder because I'm freaking the fuck out. She calls the admin on me, luckily it was my friend's mother and she helps me call my mom. My mom gave her hell, the work was waived and she didn't talk to me for the rest of the year.

&#x200B;

TLDR; I got in trouble because my asshole science teacher refused to waive work that the principal approved for me to be waived."

Since BK uses a conveyor belt broiler, there wouldn't be a way for them to implement the same practices as White Castle (the most popular example I've seen). The only way I could see this working is if they used the griddle tops they use to cook eggs, but that still leads to cross-contamination with a meat product...aka it doesn't seem plausible price wise for BK to pull off
