I didn't understand what was to be gained by tearing more lives apart at that point, since most people seemed to agree she's not a threat to society. It looked like vengeance, like two-wrongs-make-a-right. People have been hurt, so let's hurt some more people, that'll make things 'better'.

Our family was destroyed when we were small, so I thought we could be our own family, with me the dad and her the mom, since folk liked to point out how like our parents we were. Took most of my life to learn why that's wrong beyond 'she's not interested'. Still can't explain it very well, and facts don't much change what I feel.

It's not even just sexual. I wanted her Iong before I had any clue what sex actually was. If that's all it were, I could just date someone who looks like her, or find someone to fulfill some kinky roleplay. But sex isn't really high on my list of relationship priorities, or even life.  I'm a virgin who doesn't really 'get it'. I'd be more than happy with a non-sexual civil union, so long as there was togetherness, love, two parts of a whole and facing the world together, united. Whereas, as a sibling, I'm 'just' an accessory to her 'real life'.

Didn't know why she joined me on the trip, was brilliant being with her but  terrified she'd realize what I creep I was and leave me alone again. That's partly  why I didn't do ecstasy with her when she got some, I was afraid I'd confess since I wanted to but it's none of her business in that she doesn't want it doesn't want to know doesn't care but she left after a while anyways and I don't understand that either.

Don't understand much of anything, really. Know she's better off without me, clearly, so I permanently cut her out of my life a few years ago (partly by telling her so she'd have no incentive left to try, and further cementing myself as the villain I am), but by that point we'd grown so distant again it's hardly worth noting."

Why? Do people think she's likely to drive on the wrong side of the road again if she doesn't face consequences? Why? Do they think it was intentional murder, like, see a kid and swerve and hit the gas to run him down? Or if they acknowledge it's a mistake, do they think she'll make it again, even in her own country, even after the impact this mistake has had? Or is this a case of vengence, where they don't think it's likely to ever happen again, but despite the lack of risk to society she should still be imprisoned to her own detriment because... ? To ease the pain of those who've lost their son? Will it? Or to help maintain a monopoly on justice by not disappointing their constituents when they want something done? Or to help ease international relations by working the case more within the system?

I legitimately don't understand why if she's no threat, and her suffering won't ease that of others, just what purpose is being served. IMO criminal justice should be about rehabilitation, about teaching lessons and making people better for society, and protecting society from them until they're better, but if there's nothing to learn and no one to protect... I honestly don't get it. If someone hit me, or ran over someone in my family, but it was not their intent and not like to ever happen again, I can't see why I'd wish them to suffer the criminal justice system, because I can't see how that would make anything better.

The ""functional"" addict is a laughable trainwreck. We've already decided it's not okay to kill strangers in public with secondhand, so why it's okay to kill kids within their own home is beyond me. Voters priorities, and alternatives being worse than cardiac and respiratory ailments, I guess. Nevermind the heritability of habits, normalization of self-harm and slow suicide, costs to family and society, the fact that cigarettes are the true ""gateway"" drug, or even matters of taste and smell.

FYI, a cup of coffee over breakfast, a beer with dinner, or a cigar outside after desert, does not an addict make. The problem, in theory, is not the substance itself (beyond the liabilities of illegality and the likelihood and harm of addiction/recovery), but the behavior of an addict, and how it corrupts and consumes their priorities. If you wanted to catch me out, you should've asked about gambling, maybe, or whether sex addicts should keep their kids, since lots of folk describe sex as a ""need"", and abstinence unrealistic.

Better yet, an addiction to unhealthy foods. Because few see a problem with giving a child a cheeseburger. Or a thousand cheeseburgers. Take a few decades off their life expectancy, a few deviations from a normal quality of life, and no one cares.

The root of the problem is, if you're needlessly and habitually harming your child, or if you possess higher priorities than your child, you probably shouldn't have a child. Addiction is dangerous. So is state care. I know both firsthand. There will never be a perfectly logical  dividing line that isn't arbitrary, just as with the age of majority. There's no magic upon the divide. That doesn't mean there shouldn't be a line at all.

Something physical, environmental, like cold or a wound or something that just IS. It's not like, an issue, a big deal. It'll solve itself, there's food out there, starvation isn't likely but sobriety is, and scarier besides.

I know the food analogy is used a lot, but a lot of people have no trouble fasting, or missing a meal if the situation demands (running late, or whatever). It's something that can be done, with willpower, even if it's hard. But if you lined up a row of people, and went down the line putting a gun to their head telling them to stop breathing or you'll shoot them, well... there's a few people with the will to hold their breath to unconsciousness. Most couldn't do it to save their life. It's not about consequences, or willpower, or choice. It's a NEED. It must be done, and it will be done, conscious effort just doesn't enter into it.

And hell, I'm only addicted to pot, and I understand the dread fear of not having it such that, as I said, food isn't the top priority, because the pain of hunger is nothing compared to the pain of thoughts in my head I cannot stop.

I lean towards change too. It's just really difficult to see or even believe in it at times, and even more difficult to enact. At least, for some. And, not without cost. Of course it's not A or B, but both, but in what proportions and when... neutrality is a tacit endorsement of the status quo, but the level of sacrifice necessary to break it is also important. A good gay guy doesn't become a bad guy for not sticking his neck out of the closet, and I don't think it's his responsibility to pay the cost in advancing the status quo.

It'd be nice for change to take place without the need for children fighting the battles on the frontlines. I can't see how, but it sure would be nice. Division starts on the playground, and it'd be good to teach methods of defense and navigation, whatever the means, without making targets. I just fear for a little girl who wants to wear a hardhat at work because she sees nothing out of place with it, and comes home from school in tears when reality (or the bigots that inhabit it) smack her in the face with 'facts of life' for which she may've been inadequately prepared. If she thinks Pam the builder is just as common as Bob, a real construction site would be shocking, and the culture.

I know it's not like you're advocating for that to happen, nor OPs mom. The person I originally replied to said such teaching is the worst, and it's not. I just wanted to jump in before someone said it's nothing, because I felt in isolation it could be something, and that the way the world is should be taught along with the way it should be, not instead of or left out altogether.

Confusion. Expectations Subverted. I've just met them, and in doing so I've disappointed them. Failed to live up to expectations. Again. This is the first impression, the foot we get off on, and from the start I'm at a disadvantage. My mark for present not truly equal to the others, not really, only on paper.

The fact that they strongly exist, the life changing effects they have, and the high cost of breaking them shouldn't be downplayed either. OP turned out fine, great. But parents should keep in mind something might happen, that they might not have the tomorrow they planned to elaborate, might not be around for support later when times are tough, and whether the lessons and foundations taught would still be best if the kid then had to face life and the big scary world on their own.

offmychest,fetq22v,t1_fere9i8,1579378232.0,"Desegregation is good. What I gotta wonder about is the parents who wanted their kids to be first in a white school, knowing the torturous abuse they'd be subjected to. It shouldn't be the childs job to bear that burden. It's not the creation of mindless drones, it's preparation for reality, which they may then handle how they see fit with full knowledge of the situation. It's unfair to encourage girls to STEM without making clear the problems they'll be subjected to in the field as women, and why.

Problem perpetuation isn't problem creation, and it solves the immediate problem, which you have to survive to even get to the long term problem. If you fall outside the norm, it's going to be painful. People shouldn't be blamed for seeking the safest, least hurtful option.

Until they're stamped out, they exist, and folk should be taught how to navigate them instead of ignoring them and pretending everything will be alright. Bullies don't get punished, they're an unsolvable problem that always exists, only choice we get is how to deal. Keeping your head down is among the best methods. You shouldn't take weak people to task for being weak. It just makes things worse.

Lots of kids don't get support. If they don't have anyone, the least they should have is the knowledge to navigate on their own.

And now you're encouraging norms, instead of being supportive to those who want to change Fortune 500 Executive Culture. Why shouldn't they just take the job they want and be who they are at the same time? Because they're not allowed. Because norms and standards are still a thing. Breaking them isn't free. Not everyone can afford the cost, that takes a certain level of resources (internal and external), of privilege.

And it's not like they never help, either. Less than a day ago I read a post on 2X about a girl who's so glad to have a cis-girl to teach her how to be a girl and all the girl stuff to feel more like the girl they are. They want the norms. It helps define who they are. You wanna tell them they should throw it by the wayside?

Great for breaking them, but those who seek to conform or hide, or those who do the math and weigh profit for their family over personal comfort, or just plain want to wear pink/blue and feel like an X, or find faking it safest or most comfortable, shouldn't be forced or discouraged anymore than the klingons. The system must be taken into account. You wouldn't be telling Saudi children to 'be themselves', if doing so puts them at major risk of life and limb in their own home. America has better laws, but it doesn't have better people, and rules and laws need be enforced by people. People who've probably been trained. And telling a boy they're just as likely to succeed in a tutu as a suit just isn't true, and does matter to that boys future. Folk need to know the facts. Pretending they don't exist, or not teaching them, doesn't make the real world effects of the decisions disappear."
offmychest,feqt2sk,t1_feqnpcc,1579345679.0,"That's all fair. I just think children should be prepared for the world as it is, not as we wish it were, and the reason I think English first is because they're likely to encounter it first and most. And because modern klingon, in the analogy, is in large part a response to English. You teach the deconstruction after the thing being desconstructed. You read capitalist treatises after feudalism, and Marx builds on top of that. Einstein may be more accurate, but he stands on Newton's shoulders, and the foundation is important, even (perhaps especially) if it's wrong.

Norms are real, and powerful, and there's nothing wrong with swapping a story now and then, so long as you're not giving false impressions of what they're expected to find when they open the door. They're a thing, they exist. Acting like they're not hard truths when others will enforce those truths upon you isn't a solution either, whereas pretending at least changes the immediate situation. 

Nothing wrong with boys being vulnerable sometimes, in theory. Just don't downplay the predation they'll face for it. I don't quite think it's fair to just 'let them decide', unless they know the facts of the matter. If wearing the weird is worth the punches, they should at least beware what's coming. And if they're more comfortable not being themselves then being hurt, that's okay too. I hate myself for faking normal, but it's less painful than the hate I'd get from others.

Change should be made. But we should be acknowledging that it hasn't, much, yet. It may be dumb and arbitrary, but showing up in a suit is more likely to put food on the table than walking in in a tutu. As for me, I'm already permanently  alone, broke and on two repetitive meals a day forever, so it's kinda hard to see how teaching me would've made things worse. Cause I wasn't taught klingon either. I wasn't taught shit. People should know what to expect is all, and I think the reality is less malleable than you hope, but I hope I'm wrong."

That's why in Friends, I still think Chandler Bings dad is a bad person. They  undertook deliberate actions they knew would lead to their child being harassed. That's bad parenting, and Chandler would've had an easier time if his dad DIDN'T show up to his swim meets. Deal with your own life how you choose, but don't make choices for your kids that will make life painful for them.

It's not just butting up, it's bullying, it's persistent, and it never ends, even after school. That's seriously fucking harmful. It would be less debilitating if painting nails DID just make them sick. It's not 'they might get bullied', it's 'prepare for the non-stop pain train'. Not good. It's more adaptive to just like blue or fake it.

Even at preschool, my grandmother thought it was appropriate to paint my nails. I was a little boy. I didn't know any better. You think how I got treated because of that was okay just cause it wasn't my fault? Stuff like that is easily avoidable, but if you're teaching your kid klingon while everyone else is learning to communicate with English, they're going to be isolated, alienated, and penalized for that from the start.

Gender norms are a standard, compatible, normal and expected way to interact. You can reinvent the wheel if you want to, but it's not going to be easy, nor easily interchangeable with others without standardized parts and procedures. Saying 'if you ignore 9/10 people, 1/10 still exists' is a terrible strategy for finding people. You're right, it's what people want, so why go out of your way to deny them when it only makes things more difficult?

We're coming up with better ways to be. Hopefully. But that's not how things are, yet. And so we shouldn't teach it as if it were.

I wouldn't know- I've never had a long term girlfriend. I gave up later altogether when I was taught I'm a monster, no one wants a monster, and that's not something that can ever be changed. And nothing before or since has ever meant as much to me as that first girl I never kissed, nor could it. And it happened in part because I couldn't solve the code because no one taught me there even was one. If a girl wants me to speak in English, I want to have been taught how. The first kid who was taught modern Hebrew as a first language during the Zionist movement had a hell of a childhood because there was no one else to talk to. I don't want that."
offmychest,fepslnn,t1_fepr0g3,1579329862.0,"One of the reasons my first girlfriend dumped me was because she thought I wasn't interested. Because she (claimed, afterwards) was waiting for me to kiss her, and I never did. Funny thing that, I was in the same position.

Didn't know that, cause no one told me- I thought it'd make more sense the other way around. Who knew? Everyone who was taught gender normative experiences, that's who. Not me. My fault.

And this goes as far as even finding people. Pursued and pursuer is a Thing. Look at the questions asked- guys ask how to ask girls out, girls ask how to send hints. There's a ton of (not entirely illogical) reasons behind this. I'm a guy. If I spend my time giving hints instead of asking, most gals will think I'm not interested since I'm not picking up on their hints. And if I'm not giving hints, not inviting, as it were, then I'm unlikely to even be pursued by the minority of women who step outside traditional roles.

Even in sex, men initiate (and are Expected to initiate), in general. Women are waiting for you to 'make a move'. Unless no one told you, and you're waiting, wondering...

Why this is, whether it should be changed, whether it can be, marginal progress against ridiculous inertia barely measurable aside, it IS how it is.

I don't believe they should be shamed. I just don't believe it's healthy to encourage, that direction towards more acceptable options is preferable. Incestual sexuality isn't comparable to homosexuality. It's far similar to pedophilia. There's good reasons it's grouped with rape and abuse, not with LGBTQA, not least of which is the unlikelyhood of finding a consenting partner given the entangled nature of consent in such circumstances.

There are plenty of moral reasons, but none seem to be registering with you, and I guess I'm shitty at trying to explain. It's not icky or phobic.

If legality was the problem, all we'd have to do is change the law and it'd be all good.

It's sociological, the structures of intersecting relationships and the norms of how that plays out in practice. But I suck at communicating all the stuff that happens in context. Nevermind between these two characters and their preexisting deficits.

A person's relationship doesn't instantly become wrong if their parents get married. But the idea that if Vicky just changed her mind all would be well is also wrong. I hope someday someone can explain why better than I, sorry for wasting your time."

The point is, with incest, the home life IS part of the relationship. It's not like she's escaping a hazardous home for a few hours of healthy freedom. It's all part of the equation.

Thanks for ignoring the rape-me field, too, btw. Such capacity to ignore such things tends to be a requirement for fielding rose-tinted lenses. Same with the alien parasites altering their brains and encouraging such rapey behavior and the conflict it generates.

Blood and sexuality aren't the reasons it's not a good idea. Neithed Victoria nor Amelia WANT incestuous feelings, and there's a reason most fics that do feature end up mindraping them into it. This isn't a case of forbidden love, or an unrequited crush. The things keeping them apart aren't 'other people'.

Even if they both did want it, there would still be lists of reasons it's likely a bad idea which should not be encouraged. Continued references to biology or legality are really, really missing the point. The fact that some people somewhere may or may not be fine with it has little to do with this specific instance, and to get what's wanted the characters would need to be basically OCs, in which case why bother."

Arguments about biology or legalities kind of miss the point. It doesn't suddenly become okay to date your sister because of new legislation or because you used CRISPR and so aren't technically related anymore. It's not based on 'reproductive abnormalities', clearly, because we do not ban relationships for those issues. It's cultural norms, societal power imbalances, and with good reason considering the 'norms' of incestual relationships, even step, and incest isn't beside rape and abuse in RAINN for nothing.

Not really... sediment deposits haven't stopped, and still happen yearly, hourly, everywhere. What's in that sediment is highly dependent upon fine temperature and humidity thresholds. Atahualpa may not have had a thermometer, but bones and trees dating from that time and place can give surprisingly precise yearly readings, and lake and riverbed layers can even delve within individual year by triangulating from exact pollen and runoff ratios, a plant that thrives in drought, versus one that blooms more in colder conditions.

In some cases that may be true. You're right, we've basically done away with wilderness, what's left are more or less managed zoos/preserves of various sizes.

What I don't see is any attempt to change that, such that active intervention may become the exception instead of the norm. 'We issue these tags during these years in the service of a long-term sustainable ecosystem based off these plans and principals.' It's not about getting out of the business, but perpetuating it, so that their kids can go kill things and their grandkids too, while trying to make the best of it by not killing literally everything everywhere.

'The best we have' isn't 'a good system that we don't need to fix', it's merely the best we have, and that's not exactly a ringing endorsement. If people didn't feel entitled to go out and shoot all the prey animals, maybe the predators wouldn't be starving to death as often, and we wouldn't feel so entitled to shoot them too. The enlightened hunter sure beats the great white hunter, but it doesn't describe any I've ever met, like the types here in AK who want to shoot more bears because they're ""stealing our moose"". Ugh.

We broke it, we deserve to pay to fix it. Like with camels in Australia or pythons in Florida, appropriate culling can help prevent complete collapse of native ecosystems, but ""just going out and shooting everything that moves every few years"" is neither sustainable nor a solution- they're just tools to buy time to come up with something. But most see it as the ends itself, not a means.

Tags are, sometimes, in some places, a step in the right direction. They're a damned far ways away from the destination, though, and we shouldn't be stopping there."

Claims are made for safeties sake- IE stopping flights. There was no evidence 9/11 was terrorism immediately after the second plane hit, but at a certain point the odds of coincidence are too high to be the standard assumption and everything gets grounded. Two plane crashes in that time? No way. FAA said there was no evidence after the Ethiopia flight, but other nations grounded the MAX before waiting because they knew the odds, possibly saving lives.

The FAA just said don't fly there. There's known risk in conflict zones, as has been the case with previous downed airliners. China and others have followed suit. Chances of that aircraft failing is a known variable, and ridiculously unlikely. Chances of a mistake like this happening was also forecast ahead of time, so it's not remotely as out of the blue.

If it's technical, they need to review their fleets. If it's war, they need to avoid airspace. If it's pilot error, they need to get sleep instead of staying up all night watching the news (or whatever). Either way, there's actions to take, delay could be deadly, so even without confirmation, it makes sense to act on the most likely scenario."
