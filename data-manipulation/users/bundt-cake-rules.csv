I’d really want to know what prompted her to do this—has she been stealing for a while? Drug habit or other addiction (gambling maybe)? Onset of mental illness? This just seems like such a strange thing to happen out of the blue.

No reasonable person is going to read Facebook and think that your fiancee’s family are the ones in the right here. Unfriend and block them if you have to.

The bottom line here is that your fiancée is a grown woman, she was caught committing petty or grand larceny (depending on what the statute is in your state), she was arrested, and now you know that her family clearly lacks a normal sense of ethics. I suggest that it is time to cut ties with the lot of them. Thank goodness you are not legally entangled with this woman. And no, you don’t deserve to be treated like this by anyone. You deserve a partner who doesn’t steal from your family and expect you to cover it up for her."

I was traveling abroad, and accidentally lost my comb out of my purse while riding public transportation. My purse is small and only holds about 5 things to begin with, and since I was traveling, I only had essentials and had left everything else at my home. I had my wallet, my comb, my phone, and my bus and train pass. And the comb is one of those big detangling combs and took up the entire length of the purse. It's not like I could miss it.

Anyway, I got back to my hotel and saw that it was missing, and searched EVERYWHERE about half a dozen times (as one does) before accepting that it was gone. I went out and bought a new one.

I finished out my trip. Packed my suitcase. Made notes of everything for customs. Went through security (where I had to dump everything out into a bin). Went through security again when I got to O'Hare. Got home. Unpacked. Went about my business.

AskReddit,fd002qj,t1_fczx60c,1578111593.0,"You ever notice how all the “men’s” tasks are invariably the easiest ones, seasonal, or not frequent? You always see shit like “Well yeah, she does all the cooking and laundry, but I take the trash out and change all the light bulbs!”

I’d say that mowing a lawn or shoveling a driveway is about the same effort as vacuuming a 2-story house. So it’s an equivalent chore IF you really are mowing 52 weeks a year. If not, then it isn’t. 

Other things I would consider equivalent to mowing a lawn:

1. 5 full loads of laundry, including folding and putting away
2. Cleaning an entire bathroom, including scrubbing soap scum off the tub, cleaning the toilet, mopping the floor and disinfecting surfaces
3. Two hours of food prep and cooking (major meal, or weekly batch cooking)
4. A major “spring cleaning” project like cleaning all the baseboards and trim in the house

2. You CAN have fulfilling friendships as an adult, but it all boils down to one word: **initiate**. Even if you did it the last 5 times, even if you feel like you’re the only one who ever makes the overture. Initiate. People do get busy, but people also go through stuff and withdraw and get inside their own head—or that person could be you. Reach out and keep building your community. It is tiring but worthwhile.

3. At some point in your life (cough40cough), the thing you’ve done or eaten or drunk 10,000 times with no issues will suddenly hurt, cause an allergic reaction, or make you feel like shit. You’ll throw your back out trying to zip up your pants. One day you’ll wake up and you can’t eat bread anymore without getting a stomachache for the rest of the day. You’ll have one glass of wine and wake up the next day with a hangover. Nothing says “I’m old” like realizing that you now have to watch yourself while doing normal things.

4. Ideally in your 30s, you start to get over the fear of looking stupid in public, and start trying things just for the thrill of doing something new. Take a cooking class! Try tai chi! Do a C25K and enter a charity run, complete with ridiculous t-shirt! Go horseback riding for the first time! Do an open mike performance! Doesn’t matter what it is, if it sounds fun, do it. In my opinion, this is the best part of adulthood and the reason why we got educations and jobs. 

If you have kids, this is the stage where you start embarrassing the hell out of them. But you’ll also inspire your friends, and it creates a fun feedback loop. It’s personal growth! You’ll learn a lot about yourself.

And 5. A lot of people are commenting about the quick passage of time, and while it’s true to an extent, it is mainly an indicator that you need to unplug and be more present. It’s easy to get into a work/chores/eat/sleep rut. You need to break it up by putting more conscious effort into your relationships and personal interests. Don’t let a screen be 90% of your life."

You deliberately maneuvered yourself into a position where you wouldn’t have to be there for the birth, and where you were totally unavailable and couldn’t be contacted or pulled away. We live in a world where everyone has a cell phone on them 24/7, but you found a way to be gone and incommunicado when your wife was going through childbirth. That takes real effort.

Why did you do it? Nobody can say. Maybe it was a subconscious response to the trauma of the stillbirth. Maybe you’re just a classic inconsiderate dude who wants to *get* support but not give it. Dunno.

But you let your wife down in just the most heartless way. You’re a first responder. Would you ever respond to a call, see a person who needed help, and then turn around and go back to the station without helping because you figured it was someone else’s job? You had better things to do? Your friend had a sick grandparent, so the person pinned in the crashed car could just wait to see whether they lived or died?

It’s definitely scary (in a “canary in the coal mine” kind of way) that there’s already more than one major population center dealing with this."
AmItheAsshole,fcfjytx,t1_fcdchgx,1577630703.0,At this point it is time for all of us as human beings to admit that potable water is a shrinking resource. It’s not just about the money anymore.

AskReddit,fc8yzcb,t1_fc7mri7,1577544362.0,"Only through sheer luck, and having spent the previous 4 years cleaning up my financial mess from the *previous* recession. What a mess these last 20 years have been for wage-earners."
AskReddit,fc8xpwg,t1_fc7ozh4,1577543763.0,"Well, that’s true. It’s still weird to me to see people out with each other but nobody talking.

If I think back to all the things I got yelled at as a kid, they were: hiding in my room and not spending time with the family, being on the phone, which rudely tied up the line and meant I wasn’t talking to anyone in the house, playing video games, watching too much TV, keeping my nose in a book and not going outside, and being gone all day and only coming home to eat and sleep.

Now all of these complaints are conveniently executed by a single portable device that fits in my pocket, instead of having to be individually achieved over the course of a whole day."
AskReddit,fc7ld41,t1_fc77wzu,1577511185.0,"I have to quibble with the first one. I think people let kids be kids WAAAAAAYYY too long these days. Kids in their 20s and even hitting their *30s* who have never moved out of their parents’ house, have never had a job, their parents track their every movement and insist on knowing everywhere the kid goes, everything they buy, everything they do, who they’re hanging out with, etc. Parents who are all “Oh, I don’t know if my child is old enough or responsible enough to spend the evening alone by themselves, what if something happens?” and then you find out that the kid isn’t TEN, they’re 18!!! Parents calling their kid’s dean at college, complaining about a grade on a test or telling the RA to make sure someone does the kid’s laundry. What the fuck is wrong with these parents?

It is insane. Teach kids how to fucking grow up already. They should be doing their own laundry, cleaning and cooking some basic meals by the time they’re old enough to drive. They should know how to manage a budget and a bank account and to fill out an application by the time they graduate high school. They should not only be able to spend an evening alone without supervision, they should be able to handle the house in your absence without fucking it up. If your kid gets to college age without knowing these things then you’re a shitty parent. Raise your kid to be a functioning adult."
