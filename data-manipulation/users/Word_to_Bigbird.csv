Unfortunately, you can't really change their reactions. What you can do is set clear boundaries for what you are uncomfortable with them saying.  If they continue to do it after that, they don't respect you and you may need to reevaluate your friendship."

Yes, elderly people who lose weight do have higher mortality than people who aren't.  Is that shocking when a lot of terminal diseases cause weight loss?  Is the weight loss causing the increased mortality risk among elderly or are terminal diseases causing weight loss?  One of those seems more likely to me."

intermittentfasting,fcnaoxm,t1_fcn7trb,1577807528.0,"I can absolutely know that losing weight is due to a caloric deficit because anything else would violate the laws of physics.  Literally every study on weight loss shows that.  

Please show me studies that show that you're reaching high levels of autophagy in such a short amount of time fasting.  Increase in autophagy in mice, who have much faster metabolisms than humans, have taken up to 24 hours to really ramp up.  Can you find anything indicating that any substantial amount of autophagy is occurring in 12 hours?  CRP & ESR are not autophagy."

However, if you want the other benefits of IF that may increase longevity like autophagy - you are almost certainly not getting much, if any, benefit from those mechanisms by only fasting 12-13 hours."
bostonceltics,fcd2ocd,t1_fcao820,1577605606.0,"131 mins with a 3 man combination of Tatum, Brown, Kanter (+12.9).  Around 250 mins for the two-man combinations for both with Kanter.  So Brown & Kanter playing in a group without Tatum must be doing significantly better than they do with him in order to have their 2-man combination be +18.7.

Tatum's crushing just about everyone in +/- so it just sticks out.  I wonder if it's just noise (which +/- is prone to) or if Jaylen & Kanter's styles just work really well together."
bostonceltics,fcamp05,t1_fcaaron,1577572297.0,"Kanter & Brown actually have a significantly better +/- than Kanter & Tatum in similar minutes (+18.7 vs +10.0).  It's actually surprising because Tatum is all over the place at the top of the other two-man combinations.

To the other point, Kanter's box score numbers are a +3.1 this year per FiveThirtyEight, so it's not entirely on-off data contributing to his advanced stat numbers.  Overall, FiveThirtyEight weights those items higher than on-off because there is so much noise in on-off statistics."
Economics,fbuijsp,t1_fbtec8n,1577115006.0,"I work for an insurance broker.  A significant portion of our clients are already at the ACA max deductible amounts trying to keep their premium increases down so this method will fail eventually.  I think that's partially why premium increases have slowed - deductibles have been increasing.  As more and more companies reach that cap, premiums will increase much faster.

Until something is done about the actual driver of insurance premiums, medical costs, there is no way around it."
