legaladvice,fdgkbaq,t1_fdgevdb,1578400165.0,Thanks for the reply! So even though the other guy was supposed to quit but changed his mind? I would have thought that he should be the one out of a job rather than it becoming someone else’s problem
legaladvice,fdf3a3f,t1_fdf33ih,1578352321.0,"None and he’s only giving me a week of termination pay, I hadn’t worked there for a year yet though. He told me straight up that he wouldn’t have fired me otherwise and he was happy with the work I was doing. Never got written up or any verbal warnings about anything. I’m also pregnant and was planning out how to tell him this week so this really screwed things over for me"
PregnancyAfterLoss,fde89u0,t1_fde729t,1578333357.0,"I’m currently 17 weeks pregnant, and I had only tested in the first place because I had period cramps like I was about to start for over a week. I didn’t find out until I was 5 weeks and the cramps continued for a few weeks after. You should be okay :)"

dogs,fcvkxo3,t1_fcvialx,1578004309.0,"I’m so sorry you went through the same thing it’s so awful :( like there’s tons of people who have dogs in apartments who do just fine. It broke my heart getting that call! I ended up getting my dog off Kijiji because I waited 21 years to be able to have my own dog, just for them to say I couldn’t have her the day before I picked her up! I understand they want to find the right home who won’t abandon the dog, but seriously? Lighten up the restrictions or these dogs won’t have many options for homes, and then there will be more people shopping instead of adopting"
dogs,fcvhxpg,t1_fcvgt5y,1578002455.0,"Exactly what I said when I got turned down by a rescue. I was all set to come for a meeting and pick up my dog, but then suddenly they called and were like “you live in an apartment so you can’t have this dog”. Like okay then..."
