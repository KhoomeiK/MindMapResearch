bulletjournal,fedlnzf,t3_eoj8r3,1579014587.0,"I started out with a notebook, a pen, and six rainbow colored Office Depot highlighters. Since then, I’ve bought washi tape and beautiful markers and highlighters and all that did was overwhelm me with choice and I stopped using my journal. 

I don’t know if that’s going to work for you, but if you want to add color and be artistic but still want to be productive, simple is the best way to go. Get a pack of the most basic rainbow colors and make sure you don’t have repeats of colors (like three different shades of blue). You’ll still get to choose your color scheme, but won’t be overwhelmed by choice or be wasting money on supplies you don’t end up using. 

Just get a pen, as few colors (best is probably 7 or less) as you can stand, and a notebook. And if you still want to buy washi tape, limit yourself to one that you really really love. 

Happy journaling!"
BasicBulletJournals,febakjp,t1_feb0ohk,1578956944.0,"The underlining and indexing method you described would be a great way to make note of important topics that come up in your dailies!

Now that you explained a bit more, I believe that the difference between a topic and a collection is that a topic is an idea that is indexed for reference even though it is just an important idea within a daily log. A collection, on the other hand, is an entire page dedicated to an idea. A collection would be titled with the name of the idea (such as “Books to Read”) and a topic would still be under the title of the daily log’s date. A topic has more relevance to daily logging while a collection is something you may want to reference or update often so that’s why it would get its own page and title and the topic wouldn’t. 

I hope this helps! And happy bullet journaling!"

BasicBulletJournals,feassvl,t3_eoapsp,1578951897.0,"I haven’t read his book so I can’t comment specifically on this question, but in general, I think you’re overthinking it. Bullet journaling is not about the specifics of what a “Topic” is vs. a “Collection.” I hope someone else can clear that up for you if you’re really interested, but the distinction is really not all that important when you’re actually journaling. Bullet journaling is about finding a system that works for you and that’s usually the simplest system. So if you’re struggling as to whether something should be classified as a “Topic” or a “Collection,” the best thing to do is just put what the entry is about at the top of the page and move on."

musicals,fdja2so,t3_ell5ea,1578462886.0,"For me, the point of Dear Evan Hansen didn’t come from the intricacies of the plot or the music, because as you pointed out, it all could have been executed better to make an overall better story. The point of DEH was to tackle a difficult subject and make it accessible to a wide audience. The music isn’t overly complicated and the plot may not be the greatest, but it reached people.

I totally understand why you don’t like it. I have my issues with the show as well and I have gotten tired of it over the years for reasons similar to those you have named. There’s only so many times you can listen to simple and kind of generic music before it starts to lose its meaning. 

But, the reason why I will always have an appreciation for it is because it found me at exactly the right time. I connected with it when I felt like I was totally alone. And I suspect that’s the case for many people who love it so much. It may not be perfect, but it made a huge difference in people’s lives."

Journaling,fdam842,t3_ekg9h8,1578247617.0,"I’ve been tempted by it so much so that this is my fourth year trying to make it work. It worked in the beginning, but I eventually couldn’t keep up. But here I am, trying again this year. AsI started setting it up though, I regretted it. I’m going to keep trying to use it because I need some way to keep track of my life but there’s something about it that creates the brain fog that normal journaling gets rid of. 

When I look at other people’s spreads, I get so inspired to do the same, but then I end up hating everything I create and think that I’m never going to be able to keep up. Bullet journaling hurts my soul because I want for it to work for me so badly, but it just doesn’t. And I think that a lot of people have the same issue. The community has become so saturated by art and beautiful, but unattainable examples that the purpose has been lost."
Journaling,fd7mhbp,t3_ek9043,1578206741.0,"Ahhh yay a newbie! It makes me so happy when people start journaling!! As for advice for journaling, there is no right or wrong way to do it. It’s just whatever you want to write. The inner monologue is always good and it helps to get things out of your head. You could also write about your day so you have a record of your days, but that can get tedious. My favorite thing to use journaling for it sorting through my thoughts to make sense of what’s rolling around in my head. 

If you’re feeling stuck, journal prompts can help to kickstart a thought process that you want to explore in your journal. It definitely gets easier as you keep journaling, so don’t get discouraged. 

My biggest piece of advice is to take all the pressure off. Always remember that your journal is for you. Nobody else ever has to read it if you don’t want them to.  You don’t have to journal every day if it doesn’t work for you. It’s okay to write “I don’t know what to write” and go from there. 

Happy journaling and have fun!"
Journaling,fd7kfxj,t3_ek9201,1578205886.0,I’m not familiar with this at all but I’m so glad you posted this. This sounds so interesting and I never would have learned about it on my own so thank you. I’m definitely going to check it out :)
Journaling,fcwt8ds,t3_ejae8n,1578036656.0,"Definitely check out journaling prompts, but also I think you need to shift your mindset for journaling. It sounds like you’re trying to journal every day. That’s an admirable goal, but it’s really hard to do if you’re new to journaling. It’s a new habit, and if you jump in too quickly it’s not going to stick. 

Journaling is for you. You do not have to do it every day and if you don’t have anything to write, then don’t write that day. If you do still want to write, that’s where journal prompts come in, but I’d say don’t overdo it with those so that it doesn’t become a chore. It’s best to settle into journaling, just doing it when you feel so inclined, and after a while, it’ll become second nature and you’ll learn what you like to write about. 

I hope you keep trying and find things to write about! Journaling is so good once you finally find your groove!"

bulletjournal,fcmco32,t1_fcmc0l0,1577770624.0,thank you!!
bulletjournal,fcm9kk3,t3_ehvq7b,1577767935.0,"I’ve been using a lot of watercolor recently. I’m using a Lemome notebook, which has 120 gsm paper. My pages have dried wavy but I don’t really mind that. But, I have noticed that the paper does get sort of destroyed if I use too much water. My best advice for you is to paint on watercolor paper or thicker paper that can handle the paints and then tape that into your journal. If you have a journal with a high gsm you might be able to get away with painting directly on the pages, so long as you don’t use too much water. Regardless though, if you paint directly in your journal, your pages will be wavy. It’s just a question of whether that bothers you."
Journaling,fcfz246,t3_eh7d74,1577635053.0,"I journal whenever I have something to say. For a while that was everyday, but recently it’s been more sporadic. There’s really no rules to how often you should journal, it’s just whatever works for you."

But, if you’re willing to do a little extra work, I recommend painting on different paper and taping it in so that way you have all this beautiful art but your pages are not wrinkled. You could try getting a really thick gsm paper but they will probably still wrinkle."
relationship_advice,fc7gr6h,t1_fc7g9yx,1577506948.0,That hit me harder than I thought it would but thank you for saying that. I didn’t think about it at all that way but you are totally right. Thanks for the wake up call.
bulletjournal,fc3l8a9,t1_fc3i0oo,1577392335.0,"Watercolor is not going to work on the Leuchtturm pages. They’re too thin and while the color won’t bleed through, the pages dry wavy because of the water. If you’re going to do watercolor I recommend that you either do it on other paper and tape it in or get a notebook with much thicker paper."
