Keep in mind Warlocks can obtain a max 3% hit.  1 from T1 robe, 1 from neck and 1 from ban’thok belt.  Once you get some upgrades like belts from mc and Robes of VP you may only run 1% hit.  I am a good warlock in a raiding guild who clears mc in 1hr 7min, most raids 30-35% of my spells are resisted when I wear my Mana Ig Belt and Robes of VP and only have 1% hit.
