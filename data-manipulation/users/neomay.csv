SingleParents,ff2l5xn,t3_er8uf8,1579511283.0,"I was told by one or two professionals repeatedly that it only takes one good, safe parent for the child to be/turn out OK. And they gave out posters on how to help children be resilient and things to say to encourage your children. I've also seen the love of babies for their single fathers, and it is beautiful. All parents make mistakes and life happens to everyone. You love your child, protect him/her and put his/her needs above your own (to a point-you do need to eat and have a break sometimes), you have done all you can and given your little one the best start possible. And all the stuff re the mother-they don't need to hear it all. There are some things we can keep to ourselves. It's not easy but be encouraged. Just the fact you are worried about this suggests you are a good dad. And congratulations on your little one. They bring such joy and grow so quickly!"

SingleParents,ff2edkb,t3_er7lpz,1579502679.0,Congratulations on your little bump. Have been a single mum over 10 years. Lots of parents separate when the children are  very young for many reasons. We all do the best we can for our little ones. You have support from family and friends and it sounds like you are excited about your precious unborn bub. Don't let fear of your ex or his control effect your decision. Enjoy your baby. They grow up quick.

Christianity,ff2b6zw,t3_er87yn,1579499375.0,"A few ways. Try repeating the other person's words in your mind and adding to it or praying for God to give them his words. Using pen and paper helps too, both writing your prayers and jotting down notes of others prayer points to pray about later. Having praise/worship music on in background can help too.

nursing,fdd3bqt,t1_fdbzk7f,1578293067.0,"When I first started nursing, I had to do night shift rotations too. Its only years later that I've been able to find more accommodating shifts. It seems surprising to me that often nurses and other medical staff, have to work long hours, with back to back shifts, and little sleep. Surely there could be a better shift system that allows medical staff more rest and sleep to facilitate improved physical reserves for life and death decisions/interventions, and less physical/health impacts on staff. Some hospitals (in some countries) have better staffing and shift rotations than others too.  Despite every thing, I have found nursing to be very meaningful and rewarding. I hope you enjoy your nursing journey."

I let them know I would try not to wake them and they could go back to sleep straight after. Not the case for neuro obs but the issue there was usually that they could not be woken anyway, hence the neuro obs. Don't do nights now. Much easier to be awake during the day. I never envied night duty-hard, heavy work, often very busy and trying to make important decisions under brain fog."
