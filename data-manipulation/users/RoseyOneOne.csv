It's not making art or anything, but as a writer it was a way I could be content in that I'm doing what I like to do and using my talent. It was a grind to get here but it all worked out with some luck and hard work (and I'm a charismatic white dude so I know I had an advantage that way, too).

There was a book making the rounds when I was in my 20s. ""The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari"". All the corporate people I knew were reading it and I always thought, is step one to have enough capital to casually own a Ferrari? It was a glaring hole in the philosophy and right there in the title.

Props to anyone that can write and self publish a book, but the core of that seemed out of touch to me, immediately."

todayilearned,ff8g0nk,t3_es6der,1579676844.0,"I have a friend that's an archeologist in Canada and she did a lot of work on the prairies, usually they do some research and exploration ahead of corporate or government construction to make sure the site area doesn't need preservation. She said that the original people were so nomadic that she would be excited about finding a flint piece that indicated an arrowhead had once been made--not even part of the arrowhead, just a shaving.

Then she moved to the west coast, where weather and environment was much more conducive  to more permanent settlement. They would do digs there and find pottery and structures and all kind of stuff. Vastly different than the Plains.

We once went to the southern states and it still blows me away that you can be out on a hike in the desert and if you just look around, in some places, you'll find pieces of pottery, literally everywhere if you poke around."
