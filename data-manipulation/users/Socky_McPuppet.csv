I’m in a somewhat similar position to you, plus almost two decades. I’d suggest, if you haven’t already, taking a look at Jeff Galloway’s “Run/Walk/Run”. It talks a lot about avoiding injury by interval running and giving your body the chance to recover in between running segments. 

Many people actually find that by shifting from continuous running to a run/walk interval run, their overall pace actually - and counterintuitively - gets *faster*"

To date, I've had precisely one, hour-long, professionally-given therapeutic massage, I did not find the masseuse even remotely attractive, the entire session was utterly professional and non-sexual in any way but I'll be damned if I didn't find the experience to be oddly erotic nevertheless, and I was suddenly struck by a feeling of ... permissiveness. As if anything was allowed. I dismissed the thought, and that was that, but at the time, it was quite compelling.

I think it's just almost inevitable that the entire *milieu* feels somewhat permissive - there's (partial) nudity, there's physical touch, there's a degree of intimacy, there is a good likelihood the masseur/se will be of the gender that is attractive to you, and so on. I think it's just human nature.

AskReddit,ff7x7s9,t1_ff67e6s,1579660505.0,"> Sucks that massage is associated with the sensual/sexual 

To date, I've had precisely one, hour-long, professionally-given therapeutic massage, I did not find the masseuse even remotely attractive, the entire session was utterly professional and non-sexual in any way but I'll be damned if I didn't find the experience to be oddly erotic nevertheless, and I was suddenly struck by a feeling of ... permissiveness. As if anything was allowed. I dismissed the thought, and that was that, but at the time, it was quite compelling.

I think it's just almost inevitable that the entire *milieu* feels somewhat permissive - there's (partial) nudity, there's physical touch, there's a degree of intimacy, there is a good likelihood the masseur/se will be of the gender that is attractive to you, and so on. I think it's just human nature.

None of this is meant to excuse or otherwise exonerate the people who *do* creepy things while getting a massage, but I can at least understand the association. It's kind of inevitable, I think."
