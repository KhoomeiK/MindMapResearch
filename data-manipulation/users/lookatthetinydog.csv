AskReddit,ffh6qdm,t1_ffh50fl,1579924655.0,"I’ve worked with my SO in the past and we’ve got into arguments before about how coworkers/management treats us both differently and it’s exactly like this. For example, if I’m a waiter in a restaurant, I’m far less likely to get tipped and more likely to be shit on than she is.

Outside of work, I’ve often felt like I hold her back in times of struggle because the world and society we live in is much more forgiving for women and likely to help. This one factor alone has made me question whether I should be with her or any woman at all."

AskReddit,ffh5ecw,t1_ffh1aio,1579923590.0,"For me, it isn’t that it’s painful but just nails that nihilism coffin tighter shut. There are A LOT of utterly hopeless aspects of life already, then the whole “man up” thing is even more hopeless. I’m not even allowed to have fucking negative emotions. Man up. Just man up. I’ll backhand the next motherfucker to say that to me irl."
AskReddit,ffh4zud,t1_ffg89h5,1579923272.0,"Dude, you don’t even have to be gay. I’ve been struggling with homelessness and the problems it has caused me for the past 2-3 years now and it is EXACTLY how you described. I’ve never been in a shelter, but damnit, I have thought about trying the whole gay thing just so that I could maybe open myself up to other routes of escaping that sort of life. 

Fuck what people think about your disability. I’m proud of you for doing something and trying to get off the streets. I would advise you to just lie to anyone “important.” If they’re going to judge your struggle, then you shouldn’t feel any type of way about lying to them. Fuck this world and fuck capitalism most of all."
AskReddit,ffh44as,t3_etcyd6,1579922589.0,"Stop associating male value and success with money alone. If I’m an adult male and poor, I’m somehow the trashiest failure on earth, but if a woman is in the same predicament, she is undoubtedly treated better nine times out of ten. 

I have enough to live a life that makes me happy, but oh, I won’t even be approached by women if I’m not flashy and offering them a nice house or car to share with me, I’m talked down to by others, and just generally frowned upon. Not to sound like an incel, but if I were a woman, a moderately attractive woman at that, my social experiences would be much, much different. 

It’s sad that the circumstances of one’s birth, which we have NO control over, are used against so many people, both male and female. Fuck this system."

Even the stuff he does have a choice about, let’s put it this way: if he was busy working out and worrying about appearance, there might be fewer movies.
