Damnthatsinteresting,fe3wadr,t1_fe3fzsd,1578853462.0,"Sort of? Russian interests are furthered by a divided West. Sowing dissent -- propping up nationalist movements, anti-science movements, anti-immigrant movements, far right religious fundamentalism, etc -- helps keep Western countries apart. Putin helping to pave the way for Trump getting elected has done more for the Russian state than any Russian in the last 60 years. Russia still sees the former Soviet republics as their vassal states, but NATO and the EU have brought democratic governments away from Russia, but if the US starts to pull back from NATO, the UK leaves the EU, anti-immigrant parties win seats in Germany, etc, there's less political capital in those countries to warrant things like foreign aid."

People, data, models, observations, and every 10 year old who's ever looked through a telescope has...what, been lying? Doesn't have a brain as big as yours? Been mislead by aliens?

What possible motive could there be for anyone to lie about the planet's shape? How could that be monetized? Who benefits? As conspiracy theories go this one is just bizarre. It's the largest cover-up in human history and it's about something as asinine as the shape of the planet? C'mon man, that's nuts."

worldpolitics,fdcyd33,t1_fdc8ruo,1578287975.0,"Israel and KSA are against the deal because it legitimizes Iran, their biggest regional rival, not because it wasn't working. Again, Trump's own appointees are on record saying the deal was succeeding in stopping Iran from making weapons. Your claim that ""by all accounts it wasn't working"" is patently false. You're lying. It was working before it was ripped up because Trump was jealous."

worldpolitics,fdc84ht,t1_fdc4e8i,1578268957.0,"The deal also didn't talk about unicorns or fairy dust, it was about nuclear weapons. Iran is a sovereign nation, not a vassal state of the US, we created a deal for regional stability and to deter them from making nuclear weapons, and by all accounts it was working. Do you really think we're better off without it, now that the dangerous idiot in the White House, without a strategic bone in his bone spurs ridden excuse for a body, has escalated tensions in a naked attempt to change the conversation away from him committing bribery in Ukraine?

Nuclear power is fair game, its an efficient, cheap, and low-emission power source that frankly everyone should be using as a tool to slow climate change."

worldpolitics,fdbe9y9,t1_fdaxqa3,1578256570.0,"Even Trump's advisors said that the nuclear deal was working before he tore it up. He's a petty, small, ineffectual person who just didn't like that something Obama did was working, so he killed it out of spite.

If Trump takes us to war, it'll be his war, not the United States'. Iran was starting to liberalise, slowly of course, but you can't dismantle an oppressive regime in a day. In most cases. We, however, can dismantle this dangerous idiot in one day this November."
