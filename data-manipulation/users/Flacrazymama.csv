My son said he couldn't tell if the man was drunk, drugged up or just mentally unstable. My son is pretty good size 6'3"" and 180 pounds or so but he felt very unsafe.

I know Susan did a lot of wrongdoing in the situation but her and her unborn child didn't deserve to be killed and discarded like trash. Also, every time I see her name, it reminds me of  the Susan Smith who killed her two boys by letting her car roll into a lake with them inside.

At 10, younger brother was chasing me in the yard telling me he was going to pee on me, older brother had broke a Coke bottle in the yard night before and I ran over it. 20 stitches between my big toe and next toe, huge bubble thingy at bottom of big toe, looks like they just shoved my meat back in and sewed it up. At 19, almost sliced my thumb off with a new knife while slicing tomatoes at work. Anyways, have gotten scars/stitches from multiple surgeries- gallbladder, carpal tunnel both hands, neck fusion, and colectomy (colon removed) with IRA.

JustNoSO,fdmwgys,t3_em7a1p,1578568987.0,I had a very abusive ex and not letting me sleep was one of his tactics of abuse and torment. Easier to manipulate someone when they're in a fog. He would come in the room and wake me up in the middle of the night to ask who I was just talking to. Or he would keep coming in the room and turn on the light to look for something and wake me up to help look for it. Many other ways to make sure I was sleep deprived. He eventually made me sleep with the light on so he could see when he came into the room. It was a horrible time of my life.

It's not fun for them or their families. Their jobs are airborne linguists and one of their languages is Arabic.
