Only if it's one without a fan following.  Shinkai movies are great for this, but literally every time a character made their first appearance on screen in the My Hero Academia movie that came out a couple years ago, like half of the girls in the theater started screaming and it was super annoying.  Pro tip if you're one of those types: it ruins the movie when you scream every 30 seconds, that's why the signs say ""no talking."""
