I think more and more people are copying the American connotations of the word nationalist. Even 15 years ago if you didn't consider yourself an Irish nationalist people would think you're an oddball.
todayilearned,fgkeiw0,t1_fgk73gu,1580863696.0,"I'm Irish and used to live in Canada. In Vancouver they make a huge deal about recycling and being eco friendly, but to us the waste was shocking. Plastic straws, cutlery, bags being given out like they're going out of style etc. Ireland is not considered to be an eco friendly country by any stretch of the imagination yet we recycle a good bit more than Canada. Imho the reason for this is almost certainly the strict division of waste. You are allowed recycle more things in BC than Ireland, but there's like 3 recycling bins the COV provides, and you can be fined for using them wrong. Which incentives you to just throw everything into a tied black refuse bag and dump it in the trash. A lot of people are just too damn lazy to recycle, but after a while me and the people I lived with would often throw recyclables into the trash rather than ""risking it"""
todayilearned,fgke1o6,t1_fgkb5zm,1580863386.0,"Pretty much every single piece of plastic or paper or cardboard is ""recyclable"" but only under certain conditions, and even then it is often deemed too expensive. Most soft plastic like plastic wrap is not currently recycled anywhere in the world, and while it's possible for shopping bags to be recycled, it is rare, and other types of plastic wrapping are not economically or technically viable to recycle."

ireland,fggp11o,t1_fggh9fl,1580766447.0,"Alternative narrative: SF had to put the foot down after 100 years of Unionist appeasement because the DUP keep denying Irish people their rights and pissing away money on wood chips and orange lodges. In my opinion the strategy from our end (meaning the Republic, northern nationalists, and some of our more sympathetic pals in UK government) seems to have always been maybe if we give them a little bit more they won't have an absolute meltdown and riot like they did with the flegs. NI has to be one of the only if not the only country in the world where both sides are guaranteed a voice in government and yet it's consistently take take take by unionists without having given compromise in the past century. Every little crumb of their old protestant supremacy has had to be wrestled from them by force."

ireland,fgfb3xp,t1_fgf70ab,1580733011.0,"Dublin already subsidises the rest of the country heavily, I know the situation is shit and I would advocate for more investment in infrastructure in other parts of the country, it just frustrates me when rural people buy into the idea that Dubs are hoovering up money from all over the country to build Luasanna and the spire and white water rafting parks. 

Or when the farmers were on a mad one on the six one telling us ""Dublin people would do well to remember where their dinners come from"" (direct quote). As if we're all sitting up here munching through Aldi's stock unaware that farmers exist, but simultaneously conspiring to screw them over. I'm not saying anyone has it worse or better, but Dublin has many of its own problems it needs to fix and it's also being asked to pay to fix every other county's problems.

 I think if rural people remembered that, and Dublin people remembered how important policy in the rest of the country is not only on a national level, but even to Dublin re workforce, housing, tourism etc. we would all be able to chill out a bit and make Ireland work as a single entity. We're far too small a country to be having such regional divides."
