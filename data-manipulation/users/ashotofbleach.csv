drunk,fcwuhb8,t3_ejc3z8,1578038126.0,I haven't touched Jack in a long time. The first few times I went overboard and threw up in someone's shower or in my own mouth and almost died so I've been strictly on vodka and the occasional crown royal for the past year and a half
ForeverAlone,fcwucaa,t3_ejc42d,1578037960.0,"My personality is shit, I'm an asshole, I have a drinking problem, I'm 22 and don't have my license, I have nothing to offer anyone"
lonely,fcwua21,t3_ejc9j3,1578037885.0,"Yeah I feel you in that. When I do it it's just because I wanna feel something no matter how brief the feeling is, but afterwards when I think about why I did it I wanna drink myself to death"

lonely,fcmiufv,t3_ehyu0e,1577777037.0,Eight years? Holy shit. My longest solid relationship was five months. I can't imagine how hurt and empty you must feel.
SuicideWatch,fcmis7j,t3_ehyubq,1577776962.0,Why?
lonely,fcmiqvg,t1_fcmian4,1577776920.0,"At this point I know it won't happen. It's been years that I've heard the same thing, you'll find someone one day, but to me it just sounds empty. Some people aren't meant to be with someone else, and some people aren't meant to live past a certain age. That's just life."
lonely,fcmi4gy,t1_fcmhzjl,1577776181.0,"I haven't had someone touch me like they love me in so long I don't even remeber what it feels like, so that could be part of it"
drunk,fcmi2e6,t1_fcmhvnl,1577776112.0,That's a good way to look at it. When I feel like getting fucked up I'll take a drink every time I die and that usually gets me drunk pretty fast without pissing me off at the game
lonely,fcmhzfs,t3_ehyvf4,1577776017.0,"I'm a 21m and I was the same as you when I was 19. I was still a virgin, knew I would never have a girlfriend again so I went to a ""massage"" parlor and lost it there. But I totally understand where you're coming from, people have been telling me I'll find someone for years and I haven't and it's just bullshit they say to make you feel better about yourself but it doesn't work."

lonely,fc4engx,t3_eg4sfy,1577414461.0,"I used to think i was just unlucky but just like some people aren't meant to live past a certain age, some people aren't meant to be with someone. It sucks"
SuicideWatch,fc4ek79,t3_eg3icw,1577414389.0,"These are very legitimate problems but remeber whenever you talk about large groups of people there are minorities and exceptions, and these men who have been in your life are only the worst of them. There are plenty of good guys out there no matter how impossible that seems to you. Stay strong"
ForeverAlone,fc4edo9,t3_eg3lse,1577414240.0,"Sometimes I try to tell myself I'm just unlucky with girls but my personality is the main thing that repels them. That, my height and my looks. I feel like anyone who liked me would be settling or going with their last resort and I don't want anyone to make that mistake"
lonely,fc4e6u6,t3_eg4sfy,1577414082.0,I wish it was that simple. I have too many personality flaws to ever have something so normal
SuicideWatch,fc4e49z,t3_eg3mbh,1577414024.0,I've spent almost every moment of the last six years faking my happiness

lonely,fc4dgkl,t3_eg4sfy,1577413479.0,"I don't wish someone loved me because I'm not worth it and I would fuck things up instantly, but I get this strange feeling when I see or hear people with their boyfriends or girlfriends. Almost annoyed but just a pinch of jealousy."
