rant,fdlp7tl,t1_fdkqndw,1578529210.0,"Texas alone has a GDP of $1.8 trillion dollars. You're telling me that Australia, the Texas of the Southern Hemisphere, has a GDP that is barely 1/4 of that?


Also the American Catholic Church has an operating budget of $170 billion. That's not their revenue, and that doesn't mean all the American dioceses would hand their money over to the French. On top of that the French government owns Notre Dame, not the Catholic Church."

There's no reason not to trust your average agent."
Insurance,fdkqc0d,t1_fdkp4pn,1578508944.0,"Not usually. The agent would earn a commission from the company once the policy is sold. This is usually a percentage of the policy premium, but does not mean you're paying more for the policy. It's paid out by the company as a cost of doing business. 

Reputable agents will present the quotes they think offer the best value to you as far as amount of coverage for the price. They may show you a variety or they may just show you one. You need to be able to trust your agent to not to trick you into paying too much but also trust them to handle the large amount of your personal information they will need in order to get you those quotes. If you don't feel like you can trust them to do that, try a different one."
Nanny,fdkn96h,t1_fdiqtvo,1578507098.0,"Not being able to complete a sentence without saying please or thank you is overkill and is no longer polite. 

I was raised being told that there were different levels of politeness and the situation and relationship determined which level of politeness/ formality was acceptable.

ie. 

Formal (Strangers, ""superiors"", elderly family members/ acquaintances, etc.) - ""Could you please hand me that phone?"" ""Thank you""


Informal (Friends, family, coworkers, etc.) - ""Could you hand me that phone?"" ""Thanks!""



In this situation, I need more examples to determine if MB is actually being impolite or if OP is being overly sensitive. Some conversations are more trouble than they are worth, especially if it's a temporary situation."
