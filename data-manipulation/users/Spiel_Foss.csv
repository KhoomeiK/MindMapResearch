So you are saying Israel will start a nuclear war rather than act in a civilized manner?

That makes my point.

No one is saying ""destroy Israel"". That is a US fundamentalist Christian self-flagellation. On top of which, Israel is a tiny tiny little meaningless strip of land - nuclear weapons or not.

Israel isn't the center of the world. 

Other than that, it appears they are waking up to the reality of the world. They need to try Netanyahu for his crimes and place him in prison. Continue to make their Zion fundamentalists behave and join the real world where civilized nations act in a civilized manner.

This is why we need to once and for all say fuck religion if it has any effect on politics. Religion should be protected like any private behavior, but once it's in public it should be meaningless.
