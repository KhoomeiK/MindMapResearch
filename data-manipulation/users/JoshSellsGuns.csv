AskReddit,feqlzct,t1_fen6eua,1579343453.0,"two blocks? I visited, walked out of the alley I parked in and turned right. within 10 feet there was humans practically rotting in corners. coworker told me when I got back, if I turned left and crossed the street right there, I'd be at the theater."
AskReddit,femm9s6,t1_femlwjy,1579262339.0,"I mean, isn't that the point of the thread? aren't all the responses going to be about something shitty (note: the responses aren't shitty, they simply talk about something shitty)?"

todayilearned,femkjvj,t1_fem6l8e,1579260202.0,bruh what my local bus in my town wouldn't even apologize if late. during summer getting the bus was 50/50 in the afternoons and that was my fucking ride home from school lmao
AskReddit,femaz29,t3_epp36x,1579246596.0,"I could buy a new guitar or a new amp, but honestly it's be better if I plugged that $1k into Japanese tutoring. a new guitar won't make me better at playing (don't tell anyone I said that) but $1k for classes is probably a decent amount of classes, enough to help me get along with this language I'd hope."
AskReddit,femautw,t1_fejvjn4,1579246448.0,why the hell would you downvote anyway? you realize nothing happens to the Karens if you downvote the random guy who simply told the story? I'm trying to do the mental gymnastics here but I can't place it
malegrooming,fem90yf,t3_cgwqsv,1579244215.0,5 months late but you totally rock the bald look. I'd argue you may even look better bald than with hair.

teenagersnew,fdzc2ww,t1_fdq2vmv,1578788662.0,"French is cool, I should probably learn it since my mom speaks it but I'm so lazy lol. you should totally go for that job, though. you know I'm not great with social stuff but tbh once you get into the groove, u kinda just learn to get along with the job. I say probably the same 10 phrases everyday corresponding to whatever I'm trying to communicate to customers, no social skills required. plus, $$$."
gaming,fdzb2hy,t1_fdrqezi,1578788393.0,"It was pretty garbage at release. I don't blame people for not having faith really, I just find it funny that of all the times for me to hold faith, it was the one time it was actually true. so it's just funny in that sense."
gaming,fdzaxbu,t1_fdqxwiv,1578788342.0,"I understand why, but I find it incredibly funny looking back now since we now know they were trustworthy in the end."
gaming,fdq2syy,t1_fdpyxzm,1578652079.0,"I remember when it first dropped and everyone was livid about their silence. now I find it funny as fuck. I also remember getting downvoted back in the day for having faith. paid off this time, didn't it huh?"
