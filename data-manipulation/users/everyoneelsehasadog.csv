cookingforbeginners,fffplk7,t3_etdprh,1579889041.0,"First thing, well done on deciding to learn! That's a great thing so make sure you pat yourself on the back. To answer your questions

Heating fats. Different fats die at different temperatures. I say die, I mean smoke, or taste funny. For example, butter can burn, and extra virgin olive oil smokes at a lower temperature than vegetable oil. Definitely yes on preheating the pan (unless you're doing bacon or duck breast, that goes in cold). I recommend warming the pan on medium to make sure it's dry, then adding your fat of choice. The heat depends on what you're cooking. Sweating onions to start a sauce? Medium. Frying onions to go crispy, High as you can.

To know its hot enough, I put a grain or two of salt in and see if it does anything. Also when you swirl the pan, the fat should move faster than when it was cold. Hot oil moves like water, cold oils moves like... Well, oil.

Question 2,what first. Depends on what you're cooking. Sauces etc, onions first. A lot of recipes that want onions, you want your onions first. Find some basic recipes of stuff you like to cook and have a read of them and see what order it wants stuff in and try to think why. For example, curries: it goes onion, aromatics, spice, meat, veg. Stew might go meat, onion, veg. Have an explore

For how high stuff needs to be, it does depend. If it says high, shove it as high as it will go. Steaks want to go on high because you want the outside to go dark and the inside to stay pink. If you wanted to cook a chicken leg, I'd do it on medium because it's thicker than a steak, so you don't want the outside to burn before the heat travels to the inside. If you have a dial on your hob, use that as a gauge. 

Finally, good recipes. Any sort of pasta dish is a great idea. I like sausage chilli pasta as a good one to learn. Italian stuff is great as it's generally a little rustic and easy to tweak until you're happy. 

Try some Jamie Oliver recipes from YouTube (people in the UK love him for easy meals) or binging with babish has a basics range. Try also some beginners cookbooks, because they're less intimidating, the recipes are tested and you can go at your own pace. 

Good luck, and don't be disheartened! I've made some truly appalling meals in my time, but I'm now a pretty decent cook. Practice makes perfect, and if something doesn't work out, have a Google as to why. Someone out there has probably had the same problem!"

For me, about 3 - 4 mins for a 2 person curry, about 5-8 for a bigger one. 

My mum also taught me to add salt when you add the onions and tomatoes, as it makes the veg release some water too.

So my process is dry spices, the onion and salt til soft, then ginger garlic, then spices, cook down until shiny, then tomatoes until caramelised, then protein and veg. Add water where necessary to stop it burning, and always warm water (this may be her superstition but it was what I was taught!)"

In UK food hygiene courses, it's sometimes called the Danger Zone - the band of temperatures which is prime for bacteria to breed. So you want to cool it quickly to below the danger zone, and then fridge/freeze it. Our house is always freezing so stuff gets cool pretty quick and there's no need for me to worry about the checking temps. 

You also don't want hot stuff in your freezer cause it raises the temperature of it (but that's more a concern for commercial freezers).

On the portioning, cupcake tins are a great way to portion batch cooked sauces. I freeze a tomato-onion base I use for curry in a cupcake tray, and then pop them out and freeze in a bag. Then when I'm cooking, I only need to grab one or two cakes of the tomato base."

cookingforbeginners,feyi1rx,t3_eqwufn,1579445856.0,"Here are some rules I live by

If you're freezing raw meat, do it as soon as you can.

When defrosting raw meat, do it slowly and in the fridge. 

Once defrosted, you must cook it - you shouldn't freeze defrosted meat. And the same for all meals tbh, once defrosted, don't refreeze. 

But, if you've defrosted meat and cooked it, you can freeze the now cooked food.

If you're freezing something saucy, I freeze it flat in zip lock bags - they defrost faster, and take up less room than if bunched up in the freezer.

Reheat until piping hot - I like it to simmer for a good 5 mins once it's at the boil stage to make sure anything that might be lingering is killed off. 

Also, label everything. You think you'll know what it is, but when you're looking at frozen things in your freezer, it's just a pile of red/yellow/orange things and it's very difficult to know what's what!"

UKPersonalFinance,feejn72,t3_eopxdd,1579035095.0,"Make a very detailed inventory as soon as you get the keys. Take the inventory they gave you, print it out, and amend it as necessary, sending the amended version over. Make sure you do this politely, more along the lines of ""nothing needs to be changed in the flat, but here's the detailed inventory from move in day so we've both got accurate records"". Be ridiculously fastidious with this, and take pictures, video, everything. It can be a nightmare when you move out if they decide there's no allowance for fair wear and tear. Scratch on the door? Take a picture. Handle a little loose? Have a video. And then email it all to yourself. 

If something isn't clean, make a note of it and take a picture. Note the oven too - if it's been professionally cleaned, budget to have it done professionally when you move. 

For electricity I'm pretty sure you can now switch to not prepaid. Prepaid is a nightmare if you're forgetful. You may be able to set it up online now - I'm not sure - but it's generally more expensive. Make sure you know exactly which is your meter and which is the neighbours. Learn how to do the emergency fiver on it too. But ask the landlady if she has a card or if you need to get your own. Just explain you've never had prepaid gas and need a step by step. Make sure you set up an account in your name. 

As you don't have gas, check how your heating works. If they're storage, make sure it's set to store overnight. 

Make sure you know where the stopcock is so you can turn the water off, and how to test the smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. 

Common first mistakes - always pay rent. Even if the place is falling apart, pay your rent. 

Document conversations. So if you chat with landlady re: window ledges, follow up with an email saying ""just to confirm our phone conversation earlier today re window ledges, I said I'd do this, you said you'd do this. Let me know if there's anything else, cheers.""

I'd also say don't buy furniture to specifically fit a gap or space, as you'll move and have something that only fits one space (I have a massive teak dining table that was great 4 years ago, and then spent two years in the spare room of my next flat until I got my current place)

And I've got it set up so if I need to take money out, it has to come out the savings, into my first current account, then into my bills account, then to my Monzo. And I have to watch my savings dwindle. 

The mental hurdle has really helped me. And I have savings accounts in my Monzo to help me week to week (I give myself x amount of fun money a week from a Monzo pot, and have a separate pot for grocery spending). It's extreme, but it's helped me form a habit where I know the cash I have is for spending, and don't need to worry that I'm eating into savings, bills etc.

 Also, do your savings first, along with your bills. I sit down at the start of the month and look at my calendar. If I'm out lots that month I know I need to put some of my fun money aside because I've got birthdays or meals out planned in. And I know my savings goal is realistic so I shouldn't dip into it."

Is there anything in the contract about the state of the place? All mine have said the property should be returned clean, as per the inventory (minus fair wear and tear). If it doesn't have that and the property ticks all your boxes, and you want to stay, pay someone to clean, but do a thorough inventory before. Take photos and videos of EVERYTHING and then leave it however you fancy at the end.

Maybe that means having a homemade pizza, and possibly a chicken pasta dish to use all your chicken.

For cutting off - I had to do it with my mum for a few years. I'm bengali, she's Muslim, I'm not Muslim, and my husband is white and atheist (so I think you get the picture). She went off the rails and I was worried for my little brother but it had to be done. She was emotionally manipulative (she stopped hitting me when I moved out for university at 18 - but it was wooden spoon hitting, not the aggressive variety you've detailed above). It got difficult, I went to therapy (therapist and I diagnosed the feeling as ""brown guilt"") and 7 years later, my mother is resigned to the fact that she can't tell me what to do and seems like she's trying to be a better person.

My cousin's dad was physically abusive towards her. Her husband used to beat her and she'd run to her parents house. Her dad would then beat her for not obeying her husband. She also cut them off, and slowly is on speaking terms with her mother, but never her father, ever again. 

It's going to be hard. They're probably going to be manipulative, terrified of what the community will say, everything to make you come back home. This is your chance to start on your terms, and live your life. Even if they beg, promise, swear on their mothers grave they'll change, they might not. Stay strong, cut off contact for as long as you need, and only engage on your terms when you feel comfortable. And well done for taking control of your life.

Don't you know heaven is at my feet?! This will kill me, I would commit suicide but it's haram!"" etc etc).

But, if you're respectful and conduct yourself well, they don't really have a leg to stand on. If your mum responds to family friends, it can be helpful to eventually get one involved who respects your situation and can diffuse your mum.
