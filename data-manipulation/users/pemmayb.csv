dogswithjobs,fc6tvq4,t1_fc5qyeg,1577489370.0,Oh don’t worry he still gets plenty of time to play when he’s not working.
dogswithjobs,fc6tq1g,t1_fc5x9bh,1577489254.0,Yes I am!
dogswithjobs,fc6toc5,t1_fc61vl5,1577489219.0,That’s awesome! The man who has this dog now also has his first retired guide dog too. His partner sends us updates on the dogs though!
dogswithjobs,fc6tinw,t1_fc5ewxq,1577489101.0,Clark! GDB names each litter with the same letter and they go through the alphabet and don’t repeat names. Some of them can get pretty strange.
dogswithjobs,fc6tfyj,t1_fc5yzaf,1577489047.0,"Yep they have groups all over the US! I raise pups for a SoCal group. The groups have meetings twice a month where they check up on how the training for each dog is going. You need to go to a certain number of meetings before becoming a puppy sitter (if someone in the group goes out of town, someone else in the group needs to watch their dog) and then after puppy sitting a few times you can become a puppy raiser. 

It is pretty intense, this dog actually went to two other families after me before passing and becoming a working guide. He really enjoyed getting into our trash can so they moved him somewhere else to break that habit and luckily it worked. I had another dog who liked carrying socks around and she moved on to two other families too but no one could break her habit so they family that had her most recently got to keep her. It’s pretty tough when situations like that happen, but at least with this pup it’s exciting that he’s working and helping someone every day!"
