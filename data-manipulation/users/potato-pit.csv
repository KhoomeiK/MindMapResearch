toastme,ff95n6m,t3_es6gq4,1579705415.0,"The GED is great. You can still be an astrophysicist or anything else that you want to be. Start at community college and get As. Its easy enough to get your pre-reqs and then move on to a four year school. You can do it, you have time. 

You're a beautiful girl. Eat something. You are stressed and your body needs you to take care of it right now.

 My break up advice is carry yourself to cvs (or sephora if youve got it like that) get an at least 5 step skincare routine, and waste 40 minutes morning and night in the bathroom doing something nice for yourself. 

Go out into the sunshine, or if you live im the northeast like me, waste 15 bucks on tanning. A little vitamin D will help you feel better. Bring your headphones. Happy music. Life gets better."

fatlogic,fes9qil,t1_ferp067,1579362981.0,Im slighty under 5'3 but above 5'2 - i look like a chunky monkey over 135 and thats being generous. Weight makes a big difference on a small frame
whatsthisplant,fen3qbk,t1_fems1dy,1579276299.0,You dont have to find one. Go to your friends house again at the end of the season. Every place that previously had a flower will have a seed aftwr the buds drop. Fat happy black seeds in a little cup where the flower was.
whatsthisplant,fen3kfl,t1_femkeja,1579276198.0,They hybrid all over the place if you plant them close to each other. One of my favorites.

While she was so sick they were like, allergic to keeping their dogs in their own yard and the one bull terrier liked to come bother our cow. I spent a lot of time knocking on doors and returning dogs, my mom would have me take tbem stuff - BUT they may very well have not been JW- i was like 16, i could have that part wrong. My mom thought they were scientologists at one point, but im pretty sure Scientologists see drs?"

TooAfraidToAsk,fdo5woc,t3_emb4g5,1578599454.0,"Me neighbors were JW, I believe. They had this daughter who had a horrible life - she had to use a motorized chair she couldn't feed herself, she clearly wore diapers, etc, and this went on until she was 13 or so. (They wouldnt give her proper care but they did use health insurance money to have a pool installed so there was that at least /s.) I  Would say that CPS got involved because I saw her again a year or so later and I wouldn't have recognized her. But it WAS her, walking and talking and HAPPY. 

 It turns out the kid had a fucken brain tumor. They didnt want to have it removed until the state got involved. 

Like.....Son of a bitch."
