bonehurtingjuice,fc7wvev,t1_fc7wdql,1577520767.0,You think one country surrendering was all sides surrendering. People were still killed by other counties after that.  Invaded counties were still full of the invading forces at that time. The war is only over when peace put it at rest and balance is restored. Not when a major contender decided to pull out.
bonehurtingjuice,fc7wpwx,t1_fc7wb41,1577520644.0,"How is a quick Google Search in any way an accurate account?  The internet is a place with many different sources of information.  How am I racist?  In what way did I justify the Nazi's? You are the racist, you justified the destruction of 2 Japanese cities that had civilians because you were not Japanese."
bonehurtingjuice,fc7v4af,t1_fc7u8ye,1577519437.0,"The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were genocidal, by the allies. If Japan hadnt surrendered they would have been invaded, the same way the Germans were.  Both sides were doing the same things.  But you are too ignorant to see that because you accept the writings of the victors as fact."
bonehurtingjuice,fc7uunu,t1_fc7ujhe,1577519229.0,"The killing of the Japanese didn't end the war.  It just made Japan surrender.  The war still went on.  And if you'd done some research you could easily find the Nazi parties reasoning for killing 11 million people. 
What I'm saying is that all sides of war do *bad* things.  Thus they cannot be labelled as good or bad.  There is no lesser evil in war.  The atom bombs America sent are still killing people today so re-evaluate the 200k estimate and please provide your source."
bonehurtingjuice,fc7ueta,t1_fc6iha5,1577518904.0,"When did I say I supported Nazi's? At what point did I say what Hitler did was okay? 

By my own words I said that there were no good or bad sides in war.  The people who participated in a war that killed many on both sides are also the ones who committed war crimes and genocides. On both sides."
bonehurtingjuice,fc7u850,t1_fc6kvjo,1577518762.0,"Based on what.? You being a citizen of the allied countries within the times of the war? The Nazi's had their reasons for starting their war.  Every allied country had their own reason for joining a war against them.  The result was mass death, genocides,  and war crimes from all sides. No one is innocent and thus no one can be guilty either."
bonehurtingjuice,fc7u0cj,t1_fc6lz3e,1577518599.0,I'm not siding with any political view.  I'm just attempting to entice people to do their own research and realise that all sides of wars participate in and commit war crimes and genocidal activities.

bonehurtingjuice,fc7tfnq,t1_fc6t8f5,1577518174.0,The victors are the ones who *call themselves* the good guys. They still committed genocidal acts.  The atom bombs for one example.

bonehurtingjuice,fc7r348,t1_fc6uh72,1577516474.0,"Both sides committed genocide and war crimes. 
As everyone participated everyone became accountable. The comment of growing up was meant for the childish mentality that the world is black and white, Good Vs bad.  There is no such thing."
