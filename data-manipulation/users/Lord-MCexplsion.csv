Bye~"
yandere,ffbf4di,t1_ffaooaf,1579762574.0,"Good question sir. Let me answer it for you.

A person their moral compas can break through a variety of reasons. Some of them being sexual harassment from a parent, seeing someone close to you die as a child, physical an emotional abuse, toxic enviroments, etc...

See children, most of them, their brain is not yet fully developed. Their definition of right or wrong will change through the years. And if they get abused in their early years, murder and abuse will be perceived as normal for them. There's no mental barrier for these people to go through with abuse. 

Anyway have a good day sir.

Bye~"

From the things you say in this post. It seems you are determined and focused. 

To answer your question in your post. Thinking of murdering or tying up a person is already normal. We all think of killing someone because of various reasons. But that's why we have morals. Look you've stated about moral values in your post. Insane people don't have those, most of them, their moral compose broke in their childhood.

You've said your a nice guy. You've shown no signs of being insane up until now. So you might me a little dissapointed to have heard. So to cheer you up i'll tell you i'm not a big expert on the matter. This is just the viewpoint of a 16 year old. Have a great day though

P.S. just remembered something my psychiatrist told me. ""Mentally insane people don't know they're insane."" bye~"
