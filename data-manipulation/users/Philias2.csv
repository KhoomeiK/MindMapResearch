iamverysmart,fe0oyr0,t1_fe0kjiz,1578816931.0,"It's not a terribly interesting one. The memory in general is me as a kid being at an indoor water park, with slides and stuff. The clearest and most vivid part is of there being a sort of igloo shaped thing you could go into with water streaming down over the entrance. In the memory I was sort of dreading going in, because I didn't like getting my head wet (I still don't), but still wanting to go in because it was cool.

There is nothing even remotely like that in the country where I'm from, and at the time the memory would have taken place and for a span of several years I had never left the country. Who knows where it all came from."
iamverysmart,fe0czum,t1_fe0bjcd,1578810299.0,">which I'm positive are real

How would you know? Honestly think about it. How do you really know if any given memory is real?   
Vividness? How do you know false memories aren't just as vivid as real ones?   
Correlation with facts and stories from other people? How do you know the false memories weren't created because of your knowing those facts and hearing those stories, or that they haven't just shifted over time to conform to those things?

I know it feels ridiculous, because hey they're you're memories. Of course they're real, because they feel so real. But how can you really  *really* know?   
The science is very solid on this. Memory is extremely flawed. Memories shift and change the older they are and the more often you recall them, and creating new false ones is very easy too.

A little anecdotal evidence: You say you have memories you're positive are real. Well, I have one I am positive is false. The details aren't particularly important, but the memory simply can't be true. It contradicts known facts.  
So I have this memory that absolutely certainly is false, and it is a memory that is extremely vivid. It feels *so* real to me, even though I know it isn't. 
So, how do I know any other given memory of mine isn't as false as that one, only I'm not aware of any contradictions? Well, there isn't any way of knowing.
