Also there are lots of programs you can buy to calculate out uncertainties, usually who ever is accrediting you will have resources you can use so start there. Honestly, we don’t have enough info on how far along your lab is or even what kind of measurements your lab specializes in..."
Metrology,fgkaba9,t1_fgk6u5e,1580860935.0,"We send all our stuff to accredited labs so this was fairly simple, they did require us to do some proficiency testing of artifacts though. Also OP might not be in the US so will not be referencing NIST."
Metrology,fgk3nym,t3_eyxpsw,1580856808.0,"Where to even begin...

You’ll need to show how you calculated out your uncertainties, we made ‘budgets ‘ in excel.  Will need to clearly show R&Rs, environmental, etc are included.

They will look at your processes making sure you have written and clear procedures for calibrations, that your certificates of calibrations meet requirements, your laboratory is in spec and monitored. All equipment is calibrated. And of course will review those uncertainty analysis."
