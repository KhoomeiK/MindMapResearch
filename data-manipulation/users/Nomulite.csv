I guess this is where I differ from that type of person then. For me, a game is a disappointment if I stop playing after the first couple hours and nothing is making me want to come back to it. The new God of War, for example, felt like a disappointment to me because I had heard it was amazing yet it just didn't click with me. Not a bad game or anything, just had a weird combat system that I couldn't get into. But even though I bought it full price near launch, I haven't gone back to it since because nothing is drawing me back. So when I hear someone put a hundred hours into anything and then argue that their time wasn't well spent, I'm left thinking ""what kept drawing you back, then?"""

I've had people tell me they were disappointed with a game they put a hundred hours into (the story taking around 20 hours, for reference) and that they didn't like the experience overall. How can you be disappointed with a game that you not only played through to the end, but continued to play into its postgame content? 

I tried asking, but they diverted the question by complaining ""oh so if I haven't played the game I can't judge it and if I have played the game then I can't say I didn't like it"" so overall I think people in this situation just want to complain about something to make themselves feel enlightened."
