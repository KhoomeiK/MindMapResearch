Those that got college scholarships didn’t stay in. And those that got drafted developed drug problems/committed crimes. 

Sports do weird things to people when they become the centric of their lives."
SagaEdition,ff44f01,t3_erh54m,1579555299.0,"A lot of Saga is swinging and missing at your opponents, or cheesing damage in somehow. 

So the easy answer is “Grenades, explosives, and more enemies”. The problem with this is that your enemies are going to be throwing a comical amount of Grenades to cause any real damage. (And there’s an ability to deflect grenades) And if you want to wear down their deflect, you’re going to have to mass target them. Now this only makes sense if your enemies are intelligent enough to know to focus down the Jedi if they hope to make it. But this becomes harder and harder to believe as your encounters start taking more flak from other classes. 

You’ll start catching some angry glares at the table when your players realize 6/8 of those stormtroopers targeted them exclusively, if only to make them sweat. It’s just not fun for anybody (except maybe the Jedi). 

Eventually you’ll need a whole platoon of stormtroopers (or you enemy of choice) to take down your team of Jedi at higher levels. And that’s up to you as the GM to explain why that platoon was hanging around there. Otherwise, you’ll have to beef up your boss encounters considerably."

science,fekbjl2,t1_fekakg1,1579196607.0,"It’s not really about fooling anyone. You give you control group some psychedelics and now you’ve lost all generalizability in your study since everyone involved in some-way has been given psychedelics. So now there’s no way to prove that your data is significant as you don’t have a real baseline.

You always need a control group that is not affected by the same mechanism of your experimental group."

todayilearned,fczy3qb,t1_fczwq0e,1578110618.0,"Ancient Greek poetry was actually pretty amusing. 

We have Sappho, who was a priestess on the Isle of Lesbos who was *totally* hitting on all her students (whom all were female). And that’s where we get Lesbian from. 

There is another that comes to mind that regales the winner of a Agon, where the poet goes on to proclaim that the gods will become jealous and smite him down because he’s too good at wrestling. And how he causes “the maidens to moisten” every time he wins. And how any other man should kill himself rather than engage in a spar with him. He describes a total Chad. 

Some of them are totally boring though."
todayilearned,fczs2lj,t1_fczqkjb,1578107659.0,"More like a honor thing. 

Pythian wrote for Aristomenes of Aegian Wrestling, “I pray that the gods may regard your fortunes without envy, Xenarces. For if anyone has noble achievements without long toil, to many he seems to be a skillful man among the foolish, arming his life with the resources of right counsel. But these things do not depend on men. It is a god who grants them; raising up one man and throwing down another.” (Pythian, 446 B.C) 

The long toil he talks of is the years of training that went into these Agons (competitions, which literally mean to suffer). Geeks valued hard work, constant practice, and it’s why athletes spent most of their lives in gymnasiums training. But as Pythian says, they valued a winner. 

If you won, you were the best. (And made rich in oil) If you lost, you had spent almost your entire life for nothing. So it was seen more honorable to die in the games than to forfeit or return home empty handed."

They can range from poetry competitions, to chariot races, to the Pankrations. They were some awesome, brutal games! A wrestling match with no rules, excepting biting and gouging out your opponents eyes of course. But everything’s else was fair game! 

You didn’t come to these games to lose. And the prize was often just a few amphorae of olive oil (which were used moreso for bathing than eating). Most young men trained their whole lives for these matches and either came home a champion or utterly disgraced."

SagaEdition,fcl4fyk,t1_fcl0qcu,1577739589.0,"So 350 credits is insanely cheap for a droid. Camera probes and observation droids cost both 2000 and 3200 credits respectively and their only function is to be a sentient camera. If you really want to throw him a bone then have each suicide drone cost 1,000 credits each and the necessary skill check or they half their components. 

In terms of blowing through walls with them, he won’t unless he is really stacking on the credits for it. They’re glorified detonite charges. (Which he must add onto the droid by the way. Just overloading a small droids power core wouldn’t be much more destructive than a regular Frag grenade) Detonite costs 500ea and explosive charges cost 1500ea."
SagaEdition,fckkchb,t3_ehot9m,1577727213.0,"So, credits are his limiting factor here. How many can be build? How much are explosives? Can he really afford power cores for all of them every time he needs to make a new one? And he also needs the time (and skill) to make them. 

On top of all of that, these droids will be entities just like any other droid. Which means they can be targeted, they’ll have a reflex/fort defense and a speed. And I wouldn’t want to be standing around a guy with suicide drones that could potentially explode when shot. If he wants to pull “jihad” tactics you should certainly let him.
