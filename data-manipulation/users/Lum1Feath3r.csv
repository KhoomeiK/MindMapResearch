As someone who sees gender as a spectrum, someone can be a boy and still have a ""traditionally female/feminine"" body or vice versa, but it's nice to see someone with the opposite view who can state it respectfully!"
furry_irl,fd90b5s,t1_fd8sm14,1578226243.0,"No, if you remember correctly, gatekeeping would be telling you you aren't allowed to be a furry if you're into or not into certain things. No, I'm literally just saying it's pretty generally not cool and as far as I've seen, borderline pedophilia to sexualize children's things.
