MorbidReality,few9ibl,t1_fevdb97,1579407159.0,"It's rough early on! A big thing is changing your habits. One of the reasons why people in AA tell you to hit a meeting everyday starting out. Breaking your old routines are vital when getting over that first hump. 

AA is not for everyone. It isn't for me and I'm not going to tell you that you have to use it to get and stay sober.

But it is a VERY USEFUL tool. There are people in your local AA meetings that can help you. Going out of your way to attend them, meeting new people, helping set up gets you out of your own shit. Just going and listening can help. 

If you would like to try that and need help finding some to attend, send me a pm. I will help you find them.

If you are a heavy drinker, talk to a medical professional before you quit cold.

Getting there is hard and you will have to do all of the heavy lifting, but it's worth it. Good luck."
