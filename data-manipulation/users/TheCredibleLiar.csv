I think what they were getting at is since she only has one arm, her balance is likely easier to throw off, possibly causing one or more of the aforementioned results.

Her speech has been drastically affected, but with speech therapy she's regained quite a bit and is reasonably comprehensible even without any real use of her tongue. She was tube fed for several months, but has since moved on to a liquid diet. She's had quite a bit of weight loss, but has plateaued after finding what works for her nutritionally. Also theres the physical scarring from the operations, which are large and numerous. Life will never be the same, but we're making it work as best we can."
