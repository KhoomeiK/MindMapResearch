Hyperthyroidism,ff71gcv,t3_erzz2n,1579639230.0,"I had blood drawn every 4-6 weeks once I was stable. However, I always had phone consults with my nurse, so I didn’t actually see the doctor"
AskReddit,ff2j1q9,t3_er2z87,1579508342.0,"Not a driver. But as a passenger I was once on a train during a particularly bad storm. A fence close to the tracks had broken down in the wind so we couldn’t go anywhere as a flock of sheep (that was usually fenced in) wandered around and on the tracks around us. So while we were sitting there and everybody was occasionally checking the train company’s app for updates, someone suddenly said they had to cancel all trains on a certain route (another one than we were on) because a train had collided with a trampoline that had been blown out of a garden and landed on the tracks."
aww,fegd60g,t1_fegbge9,1579088430.0,"Sorry but this story is incorrect. This roo (Abi, if I am not mistaken) was saved many years ago by Brolga who owns a sanctuary and rescues roos (mostly orphaned babies). This lady is just a visitor to then sanctuary. Abi still lives in the sanctuary as an adult roo and is ‘queen’ of the sanctuary."
BasicBulletJournals,feg3msd,t3_eosr83,1579075444.0,I’d trying this for February! As once again my attempt for January didn’t work out well...

australia,fdkpvyc,t1_fdkpnq2,1578508678.0,"This is not keeping people aware. This is using someone else’s video, without giving them credit, spreading a lie."
australia,fdkphcv,t1_fdkp2py,1578508437.0,"The girl in this video even posted on her instagram: I did not “rescue” her. Followed by a plea to credit the sanctuary, don’t use for clickbait and please donate... drives me mad what people will do for some points on the internet"
australia,fdkozqh,t3_elw48y,1578508144.0,"Stop spreading this nonsense. 

This particular roo was saved many years ago and not  by this girl. Abi now lives in a kangaroo sanctuary, which has been safe from the fires so far."
aww,fdkoi4k,t1_fdkne6b,1578507850.0,This particular roo was no victim to the fires. Abi was saved many years ago and has been happily living in the sanctuary for many years. The sanctuary until now has been safe from the fires.
aww,fdkkujm,t1_fdkh0js,1578505663.0,Actually Abi is a fully grown female roo :)
aww,fdkjebr,t3_elv1cc,1578504948.0,This Roo was not saved from the fires and not by this person. Abi (this Roo’s name) was saved many years ago by Brolga at the Kangaroo Sanctuary where she now happily lives as queen of the herd.
sleep,fdkg5qu,t1_fdkfvx8,1578503170.0,In that case I am not sure. Sorry

Netherlands,fdkfntw,t1_fdkbyyr,1578502866.0,"Happy cake day to you too. 

I am not entirely sure about coverage of a Pap smear. Women over 30 (and younger than 60) in NL get ‘invited’ to do 1 every 5 years, which is covered by insurance. I don’t know if that is also the case if it is done at your own request, but your gp would probably be able to help you figure that out."
Netherlands,fdkb2yo,t3_elulfo,1578500108.0,"You’ll have to wait. Your health insurance runs until December 31st by default. With a limited number of insurance companies you can change your insurance during the year. But only once a year and only in very pressing situations. 

However, as far as I know hpv isn’t covered by insurance. Unless you are younger than 18 and female, in which case it is part of the rijksvaccinatieprogramma and covered by insurance. Not entirely sure about this though. 

You should be able to request the vaccination at your GP(huisarts). They’ll have to order it for you. So you can’t simply go in and get it immediately."
ADHD,fdjv29i,t3_elrh2m,1578488453.0,"2 pairs of pyjama’s, a sweater, a pair of jeans, the baggy of my neckwarmer (without content), watch charger, a mug, a towel, a tube of Pringles I am eating, a bottle of Irn bru i am about to drink, a box of happy hippos and myself"
