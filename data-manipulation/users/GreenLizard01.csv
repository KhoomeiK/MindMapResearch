YouShouldKnow,fcqldsj,t1_fcmwkq8,1577888062.0,"The way I learned this is that new centuries and millenniums start every 100 / 1000 years starting from year 1, meaning that 2001 was the new millennium and 2101 will be the next century. These are the more important time frames so we need to keep each the same length 100 / 1000 years respectively. A decade is simply a description of a time period (10 years) just like eg. a fortnight, and does not necessarily need to start from year one sepecifically and to make life easier we should use the cardinal method for those. That's the system we're taught in Poland at least."

interestingasfuck,fcnnaaj,t1_fcnh3af,1577814727.0,His profile says it all...
YouShouldKnow,fcli0p0,t1_fcl2in6,1577748259.0,I fully agree. I also have to admit that I just lost a little bit more hope for humanity by the realization that there is potentially thousands of not millions of people unaware of this who are using antibiotics.
YouShouldKnow,fclhqc2,t1_fclgidp,1577748067.0,"No! That's not how this works at all! If you pause an antibiotic treatment midway the bacteria will evolve and you will need a stronger antibiotic the next time. people who pause treatments are possibly endangering thousands of people as there is only so many antibiotics we can currently produce, this is a serious current problem too, bacteria are evolving and we are running out of ideas for new antibiotics. I'm sorry for the exclamation marks but I taught this was common knowledge and this really is a serious issue."
YouShouldKnow,fclgd38,t1_fcle2z8,1577747154.0,"It seems to be a very popular example. Where is this America? About 4 people commented this too, I however never heard of it, so I'm just guessing maybe it's more popular in America than here in Europe."
YouShouldKnow,fcld1p5,t1_fcl324c,1577744989.0,"Yes I do agree, just I didn't want to make this post too technical. I didn't want to mention anything about sample size, methods of data collection etc. since most people probably wouldn't understand that from just a reddit post. I was aiming to explain this issue as basically as possible, nevertheless thanks for the feedback!"
YouShouldKnow,fcjz0z1,t1_fcjynoz,1577711160.0,"Well I'm afraid I disagree. How can you say causation does not exist? So there is no causation in the example 'amount of cigarettes smoked' vs 'chance of getting lung cancer'? You don't need to draw your own line, there is ways of interpreting data correctly and there are things that do cause other things and their correlation is not just a coincidence."
YouShouldKnow,fcjuf8j,t1_fcjadu3,1577705254.0,"True, once we have correlation evidence we should look into the data and think about what could have caused it, carrying out further studies until we either find that it is causation or dismiss the case as just correlation."
YouShouldKnow,fcjuaqq,t1_fcjjp0u,1577705075.0,"I mean thanks? I'll admit I did make 2 of them up on the spot, but I was just aiming to get the point across. If you have better examples just let me know!"
YouShouldKnow,fcju8tq,t1_fcjk0sh,1577704998.0,"that's a possibility yes. that's why I use the phrase ""tends to"", in statistics you can never be certain, but with a large amount of people you would expect your scenario to be rare, or extreme and on a larger sample size it wouldn't happen a lot. also, maybe I didn't mention it explicitly, but I am taking that we are working on correctly collected, large samples of data"
YouShouldKnow,fcju3sk,t1_fcjkzp9,1577704796.0,"true, but the fact that it's old does not mean it's no longer an issue. Think about idk like 'suicides among young people', that's something as old as time, but it doesn't mean it's no longer a modern day issue."
YouShouldKnow,fcjtbny,t1_fciouwg,1577703656.0,I taught p.s. made it sound too much like a love letter haha
YouShouldKnow,fci6g8n,t1_fchsg2z,1577658303.0,"Was about to comment the same. I think interpreting data is in general a quite big problem in today's world, even among better educated people.

Actually, I'm gonna make a YSK about this issue where I'll add some more examples, if this topic is new to you you should really check it out."
