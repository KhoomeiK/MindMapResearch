HongKong,ffgrsvb,t1_ffgqhx5,1579913420.0,Meh I’m kind of on the fence with this one honestly. I knew that but I’m sure plenty dont. It’s definitely one of those Reddit facts people like to throw out a lot which is why I know it in the first place. Obviously people use it differently today but I’d rather people learn the real meaning and not obscure it into the past and then people refer to what they really mean with 1st vs 3rd world which is developed vs developing world.  Kind of dumb I guess but I don’t see why telling people that fact when it comes up is inherently egotistical or anything.

OpiatesRecovery,ffdl36e,t1_ffdl0vx,1579823164.0,Ah well then I don’t see why not. They remove the plasma from the blood and put it back in so doubt subs would have any affect on that process.

They do have undergraduate degrees for social work specifically too. My school started offering it when I was on my way out the door. Something to consider as well.

Analgesic opioids are used all over the world for thousands of years to help with many different treatments - in fact it has done wayyy more than marijuana ever will in terms of shifting how surgeries are done without the need for ether which would be horrendous as a patient. It is basically a game changer in medicine. I’ve even heard first hand accounts of cocaine being used in medicine for its numbing effect in nose surgeries. Also I’m not even sure you can describe marijuana as “curing” anything. It can definitely help for certain symptoms or different diseases but I’ve never heard that it has cured anything. We use drugs for many different things as they all have different properties that help us in many different ways, we will discover many more for marijuana as time goes on.

MrRobot,fdqpzx9,t1_fdqp8z3,1578672392.0,"I’m very familiar with crypto but my issue is that they never indicate the amount but this is conservatively in excess of 100 billion dollars. I haven’t used a tumbler but I imagine it requires outside input to mix coins together, therefore it would require a lot of outside coins to tumble 100 billion dollars. Additionally moving that much money is on a scale of emptying satoshis wallet which is large enough to really set off the market reaction. Now my response to my own criticism is that ecoin and crypto in general was probably huge in their world compared to now. I would also think that tumbling/trading that much coin would take more than the 24 hours that seems to pass in the show. Anyway, just a small criticism that I hadn’t seen anywhere. I think my own explanation of how large the crypto market became with the 5/9 crisis works to explain it enough. Just felt a bit out of character to be a little unlikely imo."

Eventually I ended up in rehab which helped a lot and I still go to out patient and I’m about to start the vivitrol shot. Start small and as things continue to not work, go further into what may help. It’s all you can do. You can probably hide out patient from your family but it will likely take a good chunk of your time each week. I was on the oxys for 6 years then moved to heroin.

Use the in app wallet enabled browser to go to oasis.app. Connect wallet when prompted and sign transaction to link wallet. Check out the borrow, trade and save options. Dai is all about borrowing if you’re locking up your collateral eth, it is then to borrow some dai against your collateral that’s locked in the contract. You can then use that dai to buy other coins, margin trade elsewhere, trade for cash, whatever you want. You have to pay it back in order to remove all your eth from the contract though. I think save is probably the best option for you. You could use the trade option to trade eth for dai, then add the dai to the liquidity pool in the save tab. You’re then rewarded with a 4% apr for your dai. I do a little bit of everything. I have eth locked so I borrowed dai against it to margin trade on ddex.io while also lending some dai on ddex as well. Ddex works just like maker in that you have to have a wallet browser but seems like almost no one uses it. I think it’s a really cool uniswap exchange though.

**Title: Cardano’s Staking Pools Struggling With Saturation**

**Author: Mike Dalton**

**Date: Yesterday**

Large pools are causing centralization.

Cardano’s largest pools are currently over-staked. Though the exact statistics change over time, the issue has been observed for several weeks. AdaPools.org indicates that 18 of Cardano’s 249 active staking pools are saturated as of Jan. 4. In terms of value, 33% of all staked ADA has been allocated to just 7% of active pools.

IOHK considers pools with more than 1% of all staked funds to be saturated. “Beyond this, rewards are shared with fewer people and the pool becomes less desirable,” IOHK has noted on Twitter. Users who fail to switch to less saturated pools earn lower rewards—an incentive that is designed to keep pools from becoming centralized.

Saturation Smaller Than It Seems

Though Cardano has several large pools, the majority of Cardano’s pools are not over-staked. AdaPools.org ranks each pool by the amount of ADA that it has staked, so by definition, it lists the most saturated pools first. It is not clear if users are flocking to certain pools deliberately, of if saturation is just an incidental outcome.

Surprisingly, pools that offer low fees and high rewards do not appear to be particularly saturated, despite the fact that they should be very attractive to staking participants. However, pools run by Cardano ambassadors and IOHK itself seem to be attracting a lot of staked value, perhaps because of their official nature.

Despite the fact that pools are saturated, Cardano has a large network that has the potential to be more decentralized. The project has attracted hundreds of active pools, and users have staked 9.5 billion ADA on the testnet. It is possible that the network will grow even larger when Cardano launches staking on its Shelley mainnet later this year.

Can The Problem Be Solved?

Changes to staking are clearly needed. Cardano may need to tweak incentives to encourage movement between pools. Pool listing sites may need to sort pools in a way that makes unsaturated pools more visible. Users have also requested saturation alerts and automatic pool switching, two features that could make staking easier.

Though Cardano staking is relatively simple, it seems that the process will not be as simple as “set it and forget it.” Over-staking has been a long-running issue on other blockchains that rely on similar delegation-based staking systems, such as Tezos. If the pattern exists, there may be no easy solution to saturation for some blockchains.

cardano,fddg3p4,t1_fddfh27,1578310732.0,"Yeah I don’t understand what that means honestly. That’s why I don’t see CF being able to do anything. They can’t influence an authors actions without any leverage and I don’t see how they would have any leverage in this situation.  If a negative article gets clicks, then they will continue to post negative articles regardless of what the CF has to say. Now I kind of regret even posting it here bc it’s bringing them readers."
cardano,fddfava,t1_fddf71z,1578309672.0,"I do not have a clue. I’m not sure that will do much but I guess it’s worth a try. I think an active CF putting out info on testnet to be reported on by other sources would go a long way. Seems like this article was just generating some click bait crap and the author is likely not concerned with accuracy or even knowing the basics of a testnet, blockchain and development in general."
cardano,fddf138,t1_fdc7hit,1578309296.0,Very good point. Try to attack the network in testnet bc that is what it is for after all.
cardano,fddeerd,t1_fdddc20,1578308434.0,Yeah my main worry is this is an article linked straight from Delta. I’m fairly positive most crypto holders use Delta. I rarely check the news on there but was pretty unhappy when that was the fourth article presented across all coins today.  Not good at all. Some good CF advertising will go a long way in the future. Especially with McCann leading the way.
cardano,fdd7r75,t3_ekr3s6,1578298603.0,"Crypto “news” is still such a joke. I can’t recall which sites CH has mentioned were specifically black listing covering Cardano, but I don’t think this was one of them. Thinking that was possibly the Calvin Ayre site he was referring to. Reason I say that is because the sites may begin intentionally skewing their articles on Cardano to be negative that are originally not covering it at all. That would be a pretty good sign of great momentum though If those sites that had black listed any Cardano coverage began having to post Cardano articles because it became lucrative to do so or be left behind as a subpar source of crypto news. Cardano has sustained itself on a relatively small, and very dedicated group of enthusiasts. I can’t wait to see what the future will bring with McCann doing advertising and CF making a real effort toward community outreach. 2020 is going to be great for this project.
