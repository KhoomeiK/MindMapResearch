I meant the peninsula and SC ( I consider santa cruz norcal and will emphatically roll my eyes at anyone that says otherwise). Granted, early in the season it was pretty crap but the last couple of weeks have been decent.

LM has had few decent days but when LM is bad, other breaks tend to be favored."
