AmItheAsshole,feni79v,t3_epyl1d,1579285232.0,"YTA, you sound controlling and not really worth this body shaming drama (if the girl is happy she is happy with or without you)"
AmItheAsshole,fejubwu,t1_fejmnx4,1579186031.0,Well op said they are the only one in their role so unless one of the other employees is a software engineer as well they get some job security from that.
AmItheAsshole,fejsk67,t3_epbbnn,1579184806.0,">""the birthday he deserves.""

The family member who stole your meds deserves a good birthday after never apologizing or making you whole? This is next level entitlement shit here. Your sister and parents are doing him no favors by allowing him to continue on this way. Eventually he will get in trouble they can't rugsweep and by then it's too late.

NTA OP, stand your ground and I would stop all gifts personally as it's not a good idea to enable bad behavior."
AmItheAsshole,fegv05b,t3_ep1ps3,1579103143.0,">The whole family are fed up with it.

So which is it OP? In either case YTA becuase nothing productive will come from you ""calling out"" your aunt."
relationship_advice,feglh40,t1_fegd1c4,1579096436.0,I means what's more likely to firebomb your relationship? Lies that build and build until you get caught or addressing issues with honest communication as they arise?
relationship_advice,fegj1f2,t1_fefnnde,1579094279.0,Why doesn't the gf drive to OP sometimes too? Seems a little one sided to me.
AmItheAsshole,feggwvc,t1_feflpe2,1579092379.0,">My side of the family believes the same things they do, but the topics don’t usually come up because they understand I don’t appreciate it. 

Did Op not enjoy Thanksgiving because his family joined in this time?"
AmItheAsshole,fegeh1u,t1_fegce2v,1579089931.0,I mean she can't continue if her phone and computer privileges are taken away. I would also make her volunteer with a anti-bullying organization if one exists in their area.
AmItheAsshole,feae6so,t3_eo58hd,1578947527.0,"NAH, you paid the price on the tag for the jacket. If the small business wanted that jacket at a different price they should of put the proper tag on it."
AmItheAsshole,fe854nc,t3_enzomg,1578922688.0,"NAH, I can see how it's a funny story and I'd  stress to your sister that you are the only one who made a mistake in the story so if anything the joke is at your expense. She reacted concerned as any good parent would when she couldn't get a hold of you but I feel like it should be laughed about now.

If you haven't done so already you should apologize about laughing the next day and acknowledge that her feelings in the situation were valid."
relationship_advice,fdwh8xm,t1_fdwc7nr,1578758667.0,After she lied and said she didn't know it wasn't a date. Now she is saying they banged once? Kind of sounds like some trickle truth to me.
relationship_advice,fds0vyr,t1_fdryjml,1578692534.0,What if the dad discovers later on both his kid and wife hid this from him? Yeah that's not going to hurt more for sure!

bestoflegaladvice,fdqmzqt,t1_fdqkoka,1578670501.0,I mean the same agent just revealed there was a line running off the well that OP wasn't told about for the first couple of years they owned it. My trust would of went out the window then and I would be digging it up personally to check.
bestoflegaladvice,fdqhp17,t1_fdqgnxa,1578666937.0,"Yeah I'm not sure why he left the line attached if he had no intent on using it. I know it was capped off on the other guy's  property but why not cap it off at the source?

It would save a hassle if that inactive line developed a break eventually."

pics,fdmx2lr,t1_fdmvpn4,1578569721.0,But what if Trump did not have enough evidence to get Epstein successfully prosecuted? The above commenter did point out he was forthcoming in the investigation when it was opened. That investigation which ended with a plea deal. So it's not as simple as laying it all out and then Epstein goes to jail.

TheDickShow,fdkoh5i,t1_fdk76j8,1578507833.0,I mean I laughed on her dad instantly hang up at confrontation. The segment was assuming isn't that enough?

bestoflegaladvice,fdjxwmn,t1_fd02cmu,1578490953.0,"I've had this situation come up with friends and family expanding their woodlots. Sometimes if someone holds a property adjacent to you they don't use often (either they inherited it or lost interest) and you offer to take it off their hands for X sum. Then you go through the proper paperwork (a land purchase agreement) if they accept the offer but we never had this proximity issue so if a landowner refused our offer we simply shrugged and said ah well.

As for payment that is between the buyer and the seller I have seen both an outright purchase and a loan agreement with a bank go through."

todayilearned,fdbfa5a,t1_fdbdusj,1578256810.0,"Very true, I simply used him as he is an ideal example of bowing to authority. I don't agree with his later work but I can't deny his earlier brilliance."
todayilearned,fdb74oc,t1_fdayutk,1578254500.0,"This is very true unfortunately 
and it is a good point. Linus Pualing also in later years reccomended large doses of vitamin C for the treatment of several diseases and the effectiveness has been disputed in several studies since then but his earlier work on the nature chemical bond is extremely important to today's understanding. I agree no matter the titan you once were/are you should be able to back up your statements with factual data."

todayilearned,fdasch0,t1_fdae72y,1578249476.0,"An interesting example of this in chemistry is Linus Pualing (A world expert in chemistry for some aspects) snubbing Dan Shecthman's work on quasicrystals. Culminating in his quote ""There is no such thing as quasicrstyals, only quasi-scientists"" and the head of his research group asking him to leave for bringing ""disgrace"" on his team. Eventually Dan won the 2011 nobel prize for his work eventually (orginally published in the 1980s). Appeal to authority is a son of a gun to overcome."
relationship_advice,fc7eub1,t1_fc6zn2r,1577505315.0,You can choose to think that but ignoring this won't make it go away.
AmItheAsshole,fc5uw38,t1_fc5tqat,1577466430.0,Yeah and I disagree with your assessment. The parents are the assholes as I see it but feel free to share why the neighbors are.
relationship_advice,fc5uqe3,t3_egb5c5,1577466328.0,"Cheated multiple times and her friends encourage this stuff. Best you make a clean break from this situation (eviction or sell the house) and then start working on bettering yourself. 

Also thank your lucky stars you dodged this massive bullet."
AmItheAsshole,fc5s4u5,t1_fc4tde2,1577464651.0,Are they though? In OPs edits they say it was 39 degrees out and in that temperature you can get heatstroke very fast.
AmItheAsshole,fc5rpuw,t3_eg7dk1,1577464417.0,"NTA, you were booted out without a choice in hot weather. Taking responsibility is part of being a parent, you can't just kick them out with some money becuase you don't want to deal with your kids for a bit."
relationships,fc1jyef,t1_fc1g1iv,1577321010.0,But that's not a reason for not living on your own. You may enjoy living with your parents but it seems your wife does not. Do you have plans to move out and is your wife aware of a timeline or an estimate?
