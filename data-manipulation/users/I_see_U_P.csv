movies,fcvqb68,t1_fcvlqfa,1578007692.0,"Being Male or female doesnt make you better or worse at directing. Same as acting or comedy. 

Having more diversity in media is important for different point of views, perspectives, and authentic representation. 

Opportunities need to be more available for balance...there are loads more bad male directors because there are, over all, more male directors. 

The default shouldn't be cis white hetro male. we shouldn't have to make a big deal when some one, other than that demographic, gets a big budget movie gig...but until there is a more fair playing field, it does matter. 

I think it's hard for people who get to see their perspective consistently show in media to understand how empowering it can be to see something you can finally relate to."

Bad people are just that people, not the sum representation of their creed, race or sex. 

It is okay to be angry about injustices, but there are healthier  ways to deal, express, articulate, and fight back."

I got really against pits at first...but Slowly I got better...it was actually Hudson, my dog, that helped me. He got over it so fast, and even recently tried to make friends with a neighbour's pitbull mix."

aww,fcaypqv,t3_egwg31,1577579252.0,"I mean this sincerely. I think it is important to get dog training for the whole family any time you rescue an animal...no matter the size or breed...I truly feel it should be mandatory for larger dogs. 

We have to be realistic, a larger dog can be dangerous if not properly controlled. A rescue can have behavioural issues...it might be worth it to invest in training classes. 

The stigma on pits, in my opinion, is because many aggressive asshats get them and put no effort into socializing, proper training and imprint their aggressiveness to the dog."

relationship_advice,fbahu55,t3_ec6hx8,1576678563.0,"Not the same situation, but my Grandmother was a drunk. I took care of her, did everything for her but was treated like a doormat. 

On the other hand, her own kids ignored her or were rude to her (years of resentment, I suppose)...anyways, she was always so nice and sweet to them. 

It hurt a lot...but now, looking back, I see she was fighting for their forgiveness or love or whatever. 

Perhaps your grandmother is doing the same thing. She is buying the love from those she doesnt feel the same connection with."
