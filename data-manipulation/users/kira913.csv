DnDBehindTheScreen,ffjlihp,t3_etuzm3,1580001000.0,"Interesting take! I dont think I'd use it myself, but I do like the concept seeing as stats being constant across the board regardless of age feels... weird.

Just a small nitpick, elves are fully mature at around 20 (PHB specifically states 'around the age of humans), the 100 year mark is more a social standard in elven communities. According to Mordenkainen's, this is because 100 is when they stop dreaming of past lives. Before that lore was added my understanding was that it's just kind of a gatekeepy social standard to participating in elven society, considering most other elves would have centuries more life experience"

Encryption is great and all but it's comparing apples to oranges: both fruit, sure, but hardly anything alike beyond that. Might be coming soon, but currently I can't lock my apartment or storage unit with encryption, so it's kind of useless to say it's better than a real physical lock"

TheAdventureZone,fdofsf5,t1_fdo2umb,1578604260.0,"Isn't that... kind of most live-action roleplay though? It depends on the kind of puzzles and characters, definitely a learning curve with each game as to what works best. Personally I didn't think it was bad at all. This is only the fifth episode, and things are still far smoother than the first chunks of Balance.

There is also a huge difference between playing the game and running it yourself, something I learned very much the hard way. So you can't expect Travis to have absorbed all of Griffin's storytelling experience"
