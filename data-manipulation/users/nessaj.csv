YouShouldKnow,ff9s0dw,t1_ff7zxnq,1579719916.0,"About two year ago my 120L apartment electric water heater from God knows what year(been living here for 5years) broke and I replaced it.

I’ve seen tutorials on regular cleaning & maintenance and it probably could of been saved by replacing the resistance and the anode tube, but considering it’s unknown age, I decided to just replace it whole.

Before disposing of it though, I’ve opened it to take a peek inside and see what to expect inside the new unit in the years to come. 

1. The resistance was fully encrusted in sediment buildup ([like this but way worse](https://angelwater.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/water-heater-element-calcium.jpg)).

2. What was left of the anode rod was also covered in calcium

3. At least 1/4 of the tank volume was filled with disgusting yellow sediment (I had noticed yellowish water before, but just reasoned it was from the city water supply)

I’d wager yours has the same issues after all that time. Consider buying these items beforehand:

* a new anode rod
* a new rubber gasket as the old one has most likely hardened (you can cut one yourself from a rubber sheet)
* a Teflon insulating band
* a fair amount of a descaling agent (best would be Hydrochloric acid or muriatic acid as it’s commercially called here, but industrial grade vinegar or anti calcar home-use products should work aswell)

Then you should flush > un mount > open > chip away the big parts of calcium deposits on the resistance and tank > rinse > soak in HCl (best do this outside or wear a mask, glasses and ventilate) > rinse/scrub/repeat if necessary for the resistance > replace the anode (use Teflon on the screw threads as metals shouldn’t be in contact) > put back together > mount > connect the inlet and outlet water lines (also use Teflon here especially if both the lines and the inlets are made of metal - new heaters use plastic inlets/outlets to avoid galvanic corrosion) > fill up & congratulations you are done and good for years."
