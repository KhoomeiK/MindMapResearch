sydney,ffgnc28,t3_ethy89,1579910247.0,Pick-up artists are absolutely gross. Their techniques are foul and none of their interactions are genuine. Glad someone stood up to them.
Unexpected,ffesjnw,t3_et8f15,1579863472.0,This is actually clever and hilarious. Love it!
me_irl,ffdhtaf,t1_ffc2xrl,1579821164.0,Honestly I just alternate randomly depending on the day.

nextfuckinglevel,ff8j3by,t3_es88rf,1579680817.0,"People need to stop doing this in natural areas. Makes a cool photo but actually disturbs the environment and makes it harder for lots of insects, rodents and reptiles/amphibians to live, eat, shelter etc..."
AskReddit,ff842la,t3_es6fzx,1579665438.0,"Had it once (ex-cop here). Was inside a house - guy had decayed quite a bit over a few weeks in summer. Not pretty. 

Doesn't really change how you deal with it at all tbh. A body is a body."

ChoosingBeggars,ff4nio4,t3_erllrx,1579567921.0,"Really sucks you went through this, but you handled it well. If it was me, I'd tell the mutual friend that he got nasty and racist."
IASIP,ff14qz7,t3_er3yrv,1579475159.0,This is an excellent crossover.

StarWars,feldqy2,t3_eps6j2,1579219786.0,I hate finding random lightsabers in my room. I think they get in when there is a strong draft.
Damnthatsinteresting,feiq473,t3_epda4a,1579144415.0,It doesn't say anything in the article about a new species. Seems like just a statistical anomaly with the family unit staying together longer than normal.
rarepuppers,fedbmf9,t3_eokxia,1579006770.0,OK Boomer.
explainlikeimfive,fe2553i,t3_enn7aa,1578834594.0,"A lot of it has to do with efficiency of processes.

If you and I were told to both make the same sandwich in the same kitchen, the process would vary a lot.

Code 1: gather all the ingredients first, then make the sandwich in the one spot.

Code 2: repeatedly walk back to the pantry every time you need something. 

That's how this issue was first explained to me. If you plan ahead before you code, things work out better."
AmItheAsshole,fe24gxs,t3_enn7h6,1578834382.0,"NAH - I don't think this is really an asshole situation. I think you're better off leaving your name on it, it will mean more to the child. 

Alternatively, you can put your name and your mum's name on it. Joint gift. Everyone wins.

I can't imagine your name being on the present is going to ruin the party at all."

PrequelMemes,fd94zoq,t1_fd93zuw,1578228512.0,When I made this comment I was prepared for the incel wrath. Like the studio and creators have repeatedly said she is a Jedi. Not sure why some random redditors think they know better.
PrequelMemes,fd90y10,t1_fd8o0eo,1578226554.0,"Doesn't the fact that the creators and studio call her a Jedi kind of overrule the general internet complaints? Its not your decision. 

And (be honest) the complaints are primarily because Rey is female."
PrequelMemes,fd8kcuj,t1_fd8h67z,1578219414.0,"So her getting trained by Luke & Leia, given Yoda's blessing, studying the ancient texts. None of that makes her a Jedi? 

What criteria to be a Jedi did she not meet?"
PrequelMemes,fd8f9um,t1_fd8f3fj,1578217691.0,Explain how she is not a Jedi. Please.
PrequelMemes,fd8ekke,t1_fd8e9jp,1578217550.0,Correct. Good reading.

natureismetal,fcx9e8e,t1_fcx5a2j,1578056318.0,"There are a number of theories. Most commonly is that they sit on the egg (snuck in their nest by the cuckoo) and so just assume its their baby and don't know any better. 

I also remember reading a piece of work years ago that the larger and quicker-to-develop cuckoo chick helps prevent predation of the other chicks by predatory insects like botfly (or similar). Nature is crazy."

HumansBeingBros,fcx3gjj,t3_ejdbcq,1578049558.0,"I mean it is a good deed, and its better than nothing, but the big 4 banks in Australia (including NAB) have spent the last 30 years conducting some of the most disgusting treachery, fraud and general scumbaggery on their customers. This doesn't set things right."
