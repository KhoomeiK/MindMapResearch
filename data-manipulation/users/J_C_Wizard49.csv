Richer people begin moving in, with fancier cars. Fearing they might ding their car doors on things driving on your well paved but narrow roads, they appeal to city hall to make them wider. This not only makes you’re space on the side of the road to run narrower; it also makes others who normally avoided that road now decide to change their daily commute to go on it, as it is much safer, smoother, and wider.
