its not a flex its just part of my lifestyle and job, i think it probably accounts for alot of people. Out there. Which is why 50w+ fast charging is thing and getting faster. 
> real power users a good phone will last the better part of 2 days.

nah, you use your phone as much as i do its not 2 days. I dont think its two days for any even close to being called power users. Unless they have a very large battery attached"

gadgets,ffj3thf,t1_ffj13t4,1579989680.0,"I typically have almost every imaginable cable near by me. But for different reasons, but I do have a charger at home near my bed. One at my work desk. And one in my backpack that I use for work. 

So no I don't carry it around to go to a bar with. I charge nightly, but if I'm using hotspot, play a game or two, download, skype/video conference, ect like I do typically as a probably top10% power user, wireless charging ain't cutting it for me 

But even as a slightly more typical user unless youve bought multiple wireless chargers or work from home... Seems to me like you'd have some cables. At either home/work/ or car. 

But I suppose if all you use your phone for is calls and text some Instagram and not over intensive apps/browsing and no gps... You might go over a day with out the need to charge"
gadgets,ffiwix2,t1_ffiulbn,1579984421.0,"Okay let's say you bought it for your car (as a package on purchase of the car, or a gadget off of amazon), instead of a cheaper, far faster charging, easier move to another car , cable. And you arent using android auto/ carplay. 

Sure. but to be clear. Im not saying its a nice thing,  Im just saying the clear better option at this point in technology is a wired connection, Unless you have a low need for charging. If we get to the point where we have compact High power beam forming far field type tech ; or at the very least wireless charging is legitimately everywhere and atleast 30 to 40 watt not at a premium price for no reason...  Ill be interested, but till then cable."
gadgets,ffir4rh,t1_ffiqaw5,1579980629.0,"if by use you mean its  streaming bluetooth whatever sure. If you mean use as you are picking up your phone to use, no its not charging without being in contact with the charger. Unless you have some prototype tech, or self engineered solution. Cause its technically doable, but likely not installed in your car."
gadgets,ffipeuk,t1_ffiojor,1579979425.0,"For the light usage people it's fine I guess. For high usage, travelers, games, low signal areas, ect it's not ideal.And definitely should not as the only charging method. Even just as general day to day for me it's not great. Over night what ever I can plug a cable, if I'm charging during the day, a wireless charger is probably not going to be around unless I carry it. Defeting the purpose. And in the car I'm using Android auto/Car play .

Which is what the 418 number is coming from. It lists all the events number of people injured and deaths. 
> Under U.S. federal law, the Attorney General – on a request from a state – may assist in investigating “mass killings,” rather than mass shootings. The term was originally defined as the murder of four or more people with no cooling-off period[6][5] but redefined by Congress in 2013 as being murder of three or more people.[  ""PUBLIC LAW 112–265"" ]  

and for mass murders:
> The United States' FBI defines a ""mass murder"" as ""four or more murdered during an event with no ""cooling-off period""

And even as a scientific study,  They should define the criteria to what defines it then. Which this article does not. What they meant most likely is ""Mass Murders"" involving guns ie '>=4' deaths related to gun violence. Not mass shootings.   
  
So you can fuck off with your lack of understanding of definitions  and airsoft example there. Those are the definitions of the words. It not artificial inflation, its just the number mass shootings as defined by the definition of the word."
