So naturally, I don´t exactly love this track either. There are some nice parts, especially during the middle. Also that faster part towards the end before the singing starts is pretty good. 

But even leaving the guitars aside, some of the transitions between the parts could be a bit more inspired. Also the singing is something I´m not really sure how to feel about. They have done vocal heavy tracks before that where really good. In this though, I just dont know.

LifeProTips,fegqulf,t3_ep1zjv,1579100389.0,"I'm a Product Trainer by profession. I host two day technical seminars every week. I give stragglers at least 5 if not 10 minutes before the action starts. Some of the reasons are as follows:

1. Attendees pay good money to see all of the content i provide so it is in the interest of customer satisfaction to assure that
2. Traffic, especially in an unknown city, is a bitch
3. People recognize the fact that sometimes you are just a bit late and accept having to wait a few minutes as a consequence of that. Cause it could happen to them just as easily
4. Based on number 3, I have never had an attendee who showed any hard feelings about waiting. I base that on their immediate reaction as well as on how they interact with a potential straggler during the course of the seminar
5. My seminars are highly technical and full of practical exercises. So having someone miss a part of that makes everything that comes after herder for that person, which means more effort for me during the rest of the exercises which in turn means even more waiting for all the others

The real LPT, at least for a seminar like scenario, but maybe even for longer meetings, would be to put something up front thats ok for someone to miss, like introductions, organisation or going over the agenda. That way there is no real feeling like waiting but any straggler would still get any important stuff."

If a company provides phone services to their customers, they literally already paid for it one way or another. With money, not with being polite. 

Same goes for waiters or store staff btw. If your employees can't stay polite even when facing an impolite customer, you picked the wrong guy.

Jokes,fcww0b0,t1_fcwn62q,1578039965.0,"Actually that was my first reaction as well. I'm not saying jokes like this should be banned or something. It's just that they reveal something about the person who makes them and in this case what the joke reveals could be racism.

BUT: The butt of that joke is in fact not that the man is an Arab. It is that he uses obsolete reasons for wearing his type of clothes. Others already pointed out that this could also apply to camo or other types of purpose built clothes when worn casually.

 So I would actually argue that the joke itself isn't racist. And the fact that it is about Arab clothing and not other examples like camo might be due to it being some kind of Birmingham inside joke where you just don't see many camo clad rednecks. 

So now the question is: Is the intent behind this joke racist? But without knowing OP , how should we even know?
