You need someone you can spend time with and enjoy getting to know without a lot of pressure to bring her into the fold.

This woman is already jockeying for position by trying to compare the importance of her dog to your kids.

She’s probably hurt and feels foolish.  She’s mad about visiting with the dog because she doesn’t want to say that what she really means is that she won’t MOVE there without her dog and this is sort of the reality check she can’t get around in her fantasy of you rescuing her."

If she’s breaking up with you, it’s likely more than just about bringing the dog with her.  You may never understand, but that’s life.  She doesn’t have to be “right” for it to be completely fine to break up with you over a perceived incompatibility.

If she just won’t come visit without the dog, and you otherwise want to keep seeing her, then go visit her or go on dates elsewhere.

If you insist on being close to someone who constantly criticizes you, you need to stop complaining about it.  

You can’t knowingly stick your hand in an alligator’s mouth and then complain when the alligator bites you.

Either “be close” to her and smile and nod through the criticisms or reduce the extent to which you have contact with her.

I can’t imagine that you haven’t ever asked her to back off on something before.  

If you really never have, go ahead and tell her to stop.  If she stops, you’re good.  

If she doesn’t, accept the truth that this is her personality.  Enjoy her good qualities and let the rest wash, or reduce contact.

It makes me think that maybe she knew already that you’d be anxious for her to keep wearing the engagement ring and didn’t want to deal with an argument about it.

When she didn’t care about whether the rings were stacked and said she’d wear it on her right hand, it sounds like she was just saying what she could possibly do with it if it didn’t work out to stack them.  It does not sound to me like she was promising to wear it constantly and it sounds like you didn’t ask her to be more clear about what she meant.

1) The executive functions of a child with ADHD are at a level that can be about two years behind his/her peers.  Try looking into strategies for neurotypical 6 year olds to see if maybe he might need more guidance with some tasks than he’s getting right now.

2) Keep things positive and upbeat.  Criticism and nagging will never, ever work as well as praise for the ADHD brain.  A simplistic way to look at it is that motivation may increase by a factor of one with a “you can do it” while it decreases by at least a factor of two with a “hurry up!” Or “don’t do that!”

3) get a time timer if you haven’t already - it makes time visual without all the extra math and counting and multiplication of an analog clock face - no decisions required, when the red wedge is gone, you’re done.  I seriously use this as an adult

4) look into the Brili app - I use this as an adult and it would have changed my world and let me be much more independent as a child - it basically makes every task a race against a clock with cheerful reminders and a reward for getting done early.  Time pressure is great for dopamine and the endorphins needed to get up the energy and motivation to do things.

If he’s jeopardizing your family’s financial security, and there’s no way for you to stop some extreme spending or whatnot, then you might need to divorce to protect things (though he’ll likely be entitled to some of your retirement anyway).  But divorce attorneys are not cheap and you could be out tens of thousands of dollars between legal fees, alimony, split assets, and lost interest gains.

It’s time to get practical and get a consultation with an attorney to break down the pros and cons as well as realistic costs.

It could be less expensive down the line when the kids are 18 and you’re not spending lawyer fees negotiating and renegotiating custody."

McDonaldsEmployees,ffccr4w,t3_esjzi6,1579796643.0,"Question from a customer -

Those gourmet burgers that can be either a burger or chicken - on your screen, do you select “beef” or “chicken”. Or do you select “burger” or chicken?”

I only ask because it happened two different times that I told the person I wanted the burger option, and then they asked me if I wanted chicken or beef.  I answered that I wanted the burger.  And they came back with “which one, the chicken or the beef?”

The first time, I admit I got a little stubborn and said the burger the second time.  The back and forth ended briefly with me saying “the burger, not the chicken.”

The vast majority of the time, emphasizing “burger” in my initial order led to getting a burger and not a chicken sandwich.  Sometimes, there’d be a quick verification that I definitely wanted a burger and not chicken.  

I only got asked about “beef” those two times.

Just wondering what the protocol is with those for you guys.

And also major empathy with the fact that the general public probably frequently orders the burger and then screams that they didn’t get the “chicken.”"

That song perfectly captures the acceptance that you sometimes have to just sit and wait yourself out.

We are very close in land mass size (3.8 million sq miles in Canada vs 3.7 million sq miles in the US). 

Over all the Canadian population density is about 4 people per sq km whereas in the US it is about 35.77.

This is significant because the Canadian population is heavily concentrated (90%) within only 100 miles from the US border.  

In the US, that much larger population is also spread much more heavily throughout all of the states.
