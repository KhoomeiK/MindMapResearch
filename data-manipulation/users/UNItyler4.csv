***K-9 Bello Retires***

Today we celebrate one of our longest serving K-9's, Bello.

Bello and Senior Police Officer Cordell Miller, a 17 yr veteran of the department, have been partners for 9 years.  Their contribution to the department has been immense; dozens of pounds of illegal narcotics seized from our streets, many dangerous offenders tracked and captured, the location of several lost children, elderly, and disabled persons, and scores of K-9 demonstrations at schools and community events.

With over 20 service awards, picking just one to share with our community today was a challenge. This arrest from 2018 is one of many that secure Bello's legacy.

On a rainy day in Sept 2018, SPO Miller and Bello responded to the south side of Des Moines to assist Patrol officers who were attempting to apprehend three armed suspects who had just committed a home invasion robbery.  

SPO Miller and Bello spot one of the suspects.  He refuses commands to surrender, and makes the regrettable decision to ignore the warning that Bello will be deployed if he doesn't surrender.

As the suspect ran, clutching his hands in front of him, Bello gave chase.  Bello caught the suspect as he went over a fence. With the suspect on one side, and Bello holding his arm on the other side, the two struggled. The suspect got loose and began to run. Bello hurdled this fence, and two others, before securing the bite that would bring the suspect into custody.   It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog...

A loaded handgun was found along the path where Bello engaged the suspect. A wanted felon captured.  A community made safer."
