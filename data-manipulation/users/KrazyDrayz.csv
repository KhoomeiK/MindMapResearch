facepalm,fejif3t,t1_feio8dc,1579175635.0,Ehh... Everything I stated is a fact. Polar Bear numbers are rising. I'm not denying any climate change. It is real. I think it's dangerous to go into doomsday hysteria and instead we need to keep the conversations factual. No need for ab hominem attacks.
facepalm,feikh25,t1_feik4c6,1579140627.0,I just stated that it's increasing. I'm not a climate change denier lmao

facepalm,fehm30i,t1_fehcorm,1579119309.0,Arctic ice has been increasing atleast until 2014 and even if it has decreased it's so minimal it hasn't had any impact on Polar Bears i.e their increase in numbers.
