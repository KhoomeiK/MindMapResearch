MonsterHunterWorld,ffe2sja,t1_ffdx5sx,1579835209.0,"I've gone and actually set my online joining settings to manual for Iceborne. In MR quests it wasn't such a big deal if someone inexperienced joined in, I could keep them alive with life powders if they found themselves in a sticky situation long enough so they could get out of range and heal. Iceborne demands a bit more self-sufficiency from every player, and because of this I only want to play with people that have any semblance of an idea how to stay alive. Yesterday someone had apologized to me during a duo-party Investigation because a hunt took us a long time, but I told them I was happy that both of us could avoid carting through the duration of the fight. I'd rather take my time and actually *survive* than have to redo a quest or have reduced rewards."

She was used to him ignoring knocks at the door and in any normal circumstance this would have not been alarming. However, when she was at the door, she could hear his cat meowing loudly, which was something that it had never done before and was what alerted her that something serious was wrong."

Hiphopcirclejerk,fewitfq,t3_eqlyl6,1579411405.0,"(pause jerk) I saw the parody announcement post for the new Em album on this sub before I saw the actual announcement post on HHH and thought it was a decent representation of what the comment section there usual surmounts to, just a little bit of an exaggeration. When I went and saw the post on HHH, it actually managed to be even WORSE and more cringey than the comments on this sub were *trying* to be. 90% of the comments were about jerking off to the album. Goddamn I miss the days of in depth discussions and community that HHH had back in the day.

MorbidReality,fenv09f,t1_fen4ac3,1579291244.0,"From the sound of the interview, it sounds more like that he chooses to be an active father because he feels like it is the right thing to do. A quote I found regarding the incident: 

> But the victim’s family says that there is a silver lining to Mowry’s criminal actions. “It has not ruined his life, but it’s changed his life,” the mother tells the newspaper. “But he has turned into one of the most amazing dads you’ll ever meet.”

It also seemed like it was only him and his mom, which would explain why they needed a live-in babysitter to begin with and why it would be difficult for him to offload some of the responsibility onto her. I bet he still goes and hangs out with his friends but only when his mom isn't working and is able to watch the child. I think it's pretty commendable that he'd undertake such a huge responsibility despite the circumstances of it all."

So I'm sure the loud cop was filled in over the radio prior to his arrival. He needed to work quickly and effectively in order to gain control over the crowd since drunk people can be unpredictable and violent. If they would have left when the first police who arrived told them to then that wouldn't have ever needed to happen, but when you're refusing to cooperate with police after being told to leave an establishment you're going to be forced to."

gamingsuggestions,feipoqx,t1_fegzn7c,1579144123.0,"Just to add onto what has already been said, Dark Souls isn't difficult just for the sake of being difficult like you see in other games that have gained notoriety for their difficulty like Super Meat Boy or Hotline Miami. Its difficulty is determined almost entirely by your own ability to learn and adapt. Not much information other than the controls is ever explicitly explained to you but is instead discovered through exploration and your interactions with other NPCs. The setting and style of Dark Souls is executed so perfectly, and I'd likely even say that it was the most immersive world in any game I have played in the last decade. Every gameplay mechanic has has reason, meaning and, lore behind it. Even things like respawning, your ability to level-up, or the messages you can see written by other players all serve a purpose in the game's world. As far as combat goes, enemy attacks are generally heavily telegraphed and their spawn locations are static which allows for you to plan your route and experiment with different strategies in order to get to the next checkpoint. There are certain encounters that are more difficult than others, but never at any point did I find the game to be unfair which makes each victory that much more satisfying.

I'd suggest at least giving it a try, it is one of the most standout game series of the last two console generations and I think everyone who enjoys action rpgs should experience it. It took me a couple tries to get myself to stick with it in the beginning, but as soon as I warmed up to the mechanics I was hooked and have around 600+ hrs in it.

Normally I would suggest the first Dark Souls as the entry point because the level and environment design is something to behold. However, for you I would probably start with 3 as it is a bit easier than the first and provides some nice QoL additions as well some additional guidance when you're just starting. Don't worry about playing 2 right away (or at all, honestly) because it is much more unforgiving and feels unfair at times."
MonsterHunter,fef8fre,t1_feb6chf,1579050644.0,"Lately, it seems like Capcom has been removing implemented anti-piracy software in PC games after 6 months or so after release. Although I don't know if that will still be the case with this game, beings that it has a large active playerbase across several platforms and I've only really noticed them doing it for single player games like Resident Evil. Hopefully they'll remove it if they see the problems it's causing across the board for players."

It wasn't so much that I was looking for attention, but that I was so self-absorbed that I did not consider whar order people thought. Even after I had grown up enough to understand things like that were just annoying, I was barely scraping by and that made it easy to dismiss others as either privileged or not working hard enough. Either way, I thought I was special and that I could do whatever I wanted without it really mattering. So from my own experience I would say it's the opposite, it's usually someone that already expects attention to be drawn upon them whenever they enter the room.
