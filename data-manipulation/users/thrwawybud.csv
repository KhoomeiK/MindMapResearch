It’s basically like Bumble or Tinder, except specifically for friends looking to make friends. I made a few really good friends on there and it helped me immensely with my loneliness and clinging to my partner."
AskReddit,ff4l6o6,t3_erhu3x,1579566290.0,"I’ve shared this before, but figured it worked here too. 


I once had a dream that my partner and I had a daughter. I had previously had dreams about her, but none this vivid and purely her.

She was gorgeous. When I have a moment of quiet I can still see her, and my heart soars. She was so happy, silly, curious, and loving. She and her father were so close. I felt the most love I’ve ever felt, and I can honestly say that I felt this feeling of completeness. Like, I could live just like that for forever and never want anything again.

I woke up, and had a few minutes of grogginess wondering where my baby was. For a moment my brain had assumed she and her dad were letting me sleep in. Then reality hit me, and I cried for about 20-30 minutes. I wanted nothing more than for it to be real. I’ve tried to manifest the dream again by thinking about it before I sleep, but it hasn’t happened again."

It just feels like people legitimately want to hear from me or about how I’m *actually* doing about 5% of the time. The other 95% of the time, I’m the one checking in or they’re wanting me to listen and/or care without reciprocating. I do have my partner and my mom, thankfully. They’re my rocks, but it doesn’t mean I’m not still lonely for other forms of companionship."

AmItheAsshole,feo1un8,t3_eq0u3t,1579294042.0,"NTA. This is so wholesome. Makes me sad that GF doesn’t appreciate the things that make you feel good and that have sentimental value for you. My mom got me a stuffed cow when I was little. My parents were separated, so the cow was my comforting reminder of my mom’s love when I was at Dad’s. I still have “Moob” safely tucked in the memory chest my grandmother passed down to me. My partner thinks it’s adorable, and we’d keep him out we weren’t worried about the pets getting to him."

You don’t have to cook. My partner and I do “DIY nights.” We’ll have sandwiches, cereal, soup, but we each make our own meal. What makes you TA is *choosing to cook for him* and then purposely cooking things he hates. Just don’t cook for him. If he’s hungry, he’ll figure it."
AmItheAsshole,fds69o2,t3_emv42p,1578695303.0,"NTA. I was the oldest, first to drive, etc. My parents got me my first car, a beater, and paid the insurance and gave me a weekly gas allowance as a way to “make up” for me carting around my 4 younger siblings. It was really annoying sometimes, but 10 years later and I’d do the same for my kids when it’s their turn. It was a great way to learn responsibility, take some of the work off of my parents shoulders, but without burdening me with worrying about all of the bills so I could focus on the most important thing - my studies. 

What your parents are trying to have you do is just do all of the work for them and save them some money so they can afford to pay off their new fancy car. Good on you for budgeting and standing up for yourself. Don’t be their nanny/chauffeur/AND pay for the insurance on it! Outrageous."

It not only ruined her entire day creating a weird, uncomfortable vibe for everyone... but she struggled with feeling good about herself and her identity for a while afterwards. NTA and your sister is TA. I would definitely bring this up in therapy to get guidance on processing this (if you haven’t already), and work yourself up to saying you’d rather participate in a different way rather than be a bridesmaid in a dress. You are stuck in a shitty situation, and it’s not fair of your sister regardless of if it’s her day.

If I may ask, what kinds of ideas are you sending her?"
