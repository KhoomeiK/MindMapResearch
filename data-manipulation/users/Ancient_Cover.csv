SuicideWatch,fg8dm6d,t3_exiiuu,1580616410.0,"What proof do they have that it was you on the phone ?? I don't think they can make such a drastic judgement without solid evidence. 

Those people online are real dickheads. Ignore them and hang in there my friend."
SuicideWatch,fg8cuyw,t1_fg7z7ef,1580615792.0,Reaction from whom? The people aren't worth even a small suffering. You are talking about a calamity.
SuicideWatch,fg6x1eg,t1_fg6qnpc,1580578857.0,You still don't know if its true at all.
SuicideWatch,fg6o5uv,t3_ex7cmj,1580572980.0,"Don't be so hasty. Maybe she's not alright mentally right now so her mom wants to keep you away from her,"
SuicideWatch,fg6nq0w,t3_ex7dzr,1580572673.0,Please you can't do that. Your sister will blame herself. Please you have to stay. I know it seems like everything's over but its not.
SuicideWatch,fg6nd2p,t3_ex7nvd,1580572422.0,Hey please wait for more people to see this. Please don't do it.
SuicideWatch,fg603xf,t3_ex36ok,1580546715.0,But you will end up making yourself suffer more in those 10 years than you would suffer in the course of your life.
SuicideWatch,fg5zwh0,t3_ex36tu,1580546420.0,"Yeah I agree with you. Even if they have suffered a lot its not right to label others who is fighting for life. 

But you know many of the people here who comment and try to stop you have faced a lot in life."
SuicideWatch,fg2rc6p,t3_ewjzmf,1580452795.0,Reading the last paragraph makes me so upset. You shouldn't die because it's not your fault.
SuicideWatch,fg2qto8,t1_fg2qjkp,1580452255.0,Sorry for that useless comment. I didn't mean to be a jerk.
SuicideWatch,fg2qiw5,t3_ewk3jk,1580451948.0,Sounds like a great plan. Stick to it my friend.
SuicideWatch,fg2qdyv,t3_ewk18b,1580451807.0,I'm sorry no one replied to your first post. This sub is not that much of a help but people on it have stopped others from taking the final steps.
SuicideWatch,fg2q7lt,t1_fg2ikon,1580451622.0,Its very hard to be here without falling into depression ourselves. If you are not feeling well then please don't put yourself through it.
SuicideWatch,fg2e0vo,t3_ewi2ae,1580443226.0,You can still delete the post and use a throwaway to repost it.
SuicideWatch,ffzh5rg,t3_ew32ns,1580378891.0,"I'm sorry I didn't see your last nights post. But I replied to your comment on another post. 

Please you don't have you do this my friend. You can recover from this condition just like others have. I know its easier said than but you gotta do it for yourself and everyone else."
SuicideWatch,ffz5xlf,t3_ew0t1u,1580365037.0,Your family loves you. It's just we get to careless these days and fail to show it most of the times.
SuicideWatch,ffwklwe,t1_ffwjf9a,1580303991.0,You don't have to kill yourself. Treatment can help fix this issue.

SuicideWatch,ffnl5ug,t3_euasdp,1580067464.0,"17th March is my birthday :( 

Please don't do this to yourself."
SuicideWatch,ffltezd,t3_eu64ni,1580043870.0,It could also be because people don't want everyone on Reddit to know they are suicudal. They want to hide it from their friends on other subs. So they don't use their main accounts to post here in suicide watch. Instead they use a throwaway account.
SuicideWatch,ffi9z6n,t1_ffi96or,1579968864.0,This is not how you want to go. You need to go home. At least enjoy the weekend then think about it.
SuicideWatch,ffi70bn,t3_ets3ol,1579966757.0,We didn't give you this life. So who are we to take it away from you ?
SuicideWatch,ffhlfti,t3_etnsxv,1579940832.0,It's not a global health crisis yet. If you are away from China then there is very little to worry about it.
SuicideWatch,ffhenlf,t3_etmznz,1579932112.0,Your other friend is trying to stop you both. So I suppose he/she doesn't wants to die.
SuicideWatch,fffb60w,t3_etbsx0,1579880091.0,"Still you can inform the cops that you were threatened and don't feel safe from this person. 

That should deter them from doing anything bad."
SuicideWatch,fff9gx8,t1_fff3pds,1579879001.0,"Nobody ever hired a hitman from the dark web. It's either some clowns pretending to be hitmen and robbing people of their money. Or worse it could be the police or FBI or their equivalent in your country. 

I remember somewhere in the US a guy was arrested by FBI agents who were pretending to hitmen for hire on dark web."
SuicideWatch,fff7q2h,t3_etb0s1,1579877814.0,Don't do it man. It won't stop the pain.

SuicideWatch,ffes3z9,t1_fferwew,1579862851.0,It's way too early to come at a conclusion. I know it seems hopeless right now but our perspective is very limited. we don't know all the possibilities out there for us. Maybe you will find a way even if you can't see it right now.
SuicideWatch,fferpmi,t1_ffere4r,1579862260.0,Why not use that time & resources to find meaning and extend your stay ?
SuicideWatch,ffer390,t1_ffeqyni,1579861331.0,It nearly impossible to pull it off intentionally as you planned it. Even if you did managed to hit a deer and then crash into a tree. Chances are pretty high you will survive the accident.
SuicideWatch,ffeqo8y,t3_et8dpq,1579860719.0,Why do you need to go so soon?
SuicideWatch,ffeqmu1,t3_et8dpq,1579860660.0,If there was such a way to go. I believe at least 30% people on this thread would've been long dead by now.

SuicideWatch,ffep855,t3_et80m0,1579858515.0,I don't know about drowning while being drunk. But drowning is extremely agonizing.
SuicideWatch,ffeomyc,t3_et7oi9,1579857632.0,Honestly I've asked that question to myself more times than I can remember. I don't know how some people endure hell on earth but still manage to reach till the end. While others end up offing themselves.
SuicideWatch,ffecqgo,t3_esywbh,1579843301.0,No its not. Please don't try it.
SuicideWatch,ffebq6l,t3_et2t9b,1579842368.0,You can't do something like that to yourself. If you are reading this then please respond back.

SuicideWatch,ff92886,t3_escd1e,1579703038.0,Even if it worked I don't think death will be instant. its gonna lead to a horrific painful death. I can't imagine why would anyone want that.

SuicideWatch,ff2dchk,t3_er8lv1,1579501564.0,Check out her other post. She (or he) gave her address and many people called the cops to stop her. The cops said its nothing but a troll. I don't know man you should check it out.
SuicideWatch,ff2d18h,t1_ff28xet,1579501237.0,"Nothing good can come out of it. 

And to answer your question directly. You will most probably survive it (not without hurting yourself badly)."

SuicideWatch,fezg8n7,t1_fezev6k,1579457011.0,Get your hand treated first. Deal with people later. Call an ambulance or your neighbor or cops or anyone. Do it now.

SuicideWatch,fewph1a,t3_eqt3rb,1579417538.0,Chances of messing up and surviving with irreversible damages is pretty high. Don't even think about it Alex.
SuicideWatch,fe7no1h,t3_eo33ci,1578917098.0,All can be forgiven and lookedover. Give yourself another chance.
SuicideWatch,fe7as8m,t3_eo1wrf,1578912190.0,Suicide is never easy for anyone. There is no easy way out. Sure a bullet to the head looks like a split second to us. But who knows what the victim goes through??? Because time is relative and it may be very long & painful for the dying person despite looking appearing to be half a second of pain to us.
SuicideWatch,fe6uxf8,t3_eo1dtw,1578905690.0,"Don't do it man. We all have messed up but we can't just go like this my friend. Besides this pills method has an extremely high chance of failure.
