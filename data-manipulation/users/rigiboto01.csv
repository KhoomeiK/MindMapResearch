ems,fge1wj1,t1_fgcrddv,1580689641.0,In his theory he’s calling 911 for an ambulance with no medical reason. Then telling people who show up. This was all in his hypothetical situation.
ems,fg78tjm,t3_exb2wp,1580586696.0,No it’s a crime and you have just admitted to it. Also an ambulance is not a taxi we don’t drive you where you want to go.
RealEstate,fg48y1c,t1_fg47crx,1580498667.0,Outright lying could open them up to legal difficulties if it can be proven. That’s why I said probably not a lie. I’m sure bad one would. However they are most likely just trying to get their client the best price and get an emotional response from you to put more down.
RealEstate,fg478qq,t1_fg43vgr,1580497620.0,So you can’t. The sellers agent has their best interest as the driving factor. Are they lying most likely not. Where the offers fall who knows they could be for $1. $10k under asking or even $10k over asking you have no way of knowing. If you are interested in the house make a offer that you are comfortable with.

nursing,ffx7by6,t3_evpv4k,1580319263.0,"So something a lot of people need to know working in the medical field. You are human. You are not magical, you are not omnipotent. It is your job to do the best you can for your pt with the information you have at the time. Don’t Monday morning quarterback yourself with new information. If you want to look at what you did look at it with what you knew at the time. Unfortunately people will have bad outcomes sometimes even with our best efforts. It sounds like you did the best with the information that you had at the time."

This example you gave way out there.  People who are worth 50 million don’t have it all tied up in one small piece of land. They may own real estate but it would be a lot, also they in most cases have a quite a bit of liquid wealth. I don’t know why you are afraid of this tax. My guess is a complete lack of understanding."
