childfree,ff9t1nc,t3_esgfyo,1579720632.0,"As another poster said, unfortunately women on dating apps tend to get inundated with messages, so a 'hi how are you' will easily get overlooked. I'd try opening with something related to what's on their profile, maybe or pun or something a bit funny, everyone likes humour right? At least that's how I got my soon to be wife to respond to me lol. 

Also have you tried plenty of fish? It's been a while since I was on there but I'm sure there's a section where you put if you have kids/want kids/don't want kids, so straight away you can see someone's intentions without an awkward convo too early on. 

Good luck in your search!"
