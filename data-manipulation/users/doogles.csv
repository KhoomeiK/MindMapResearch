liberalgunowners,ffxjtpu,t1_ffxi26e,1580326588.0,"I don't know if all these terms are or can be objectively defined, but... I see regular liberalism as a general feeling that government is in the business of protecting the people from ""the elements"", essentially. So, things like social safety nets, regulations, unions, etc. are considered as solutions to problems.

Conservatism is generally the opposite approach, in that, conservatives protect ideas. Conservatives believe in freedom and that governments are instituted to defend those freedoms that ordinary people cannot effectively protect. This is how we get the idea that regulations get in the way of an individual's method of running a business and that it is not the government's job to say what is good or bad, just what is within rights.

I believe it boils down to ends (liberalism) versus means (conservatism).

Now, as I am nowhere near an authority on academically accepted definitions, I'll blunder into what left/right libertarianism is. Libertarian is a subset of conservatism that is intensely rights focused to the point that individuals and groups don't matter. In that sense, we should even begin to suspect ANY government. R-Lib is the most extreme form that is almost anarchy minus the existence of local power structures that would be limited to neighborhoods. L-Lib is State-level gov't but with severe restrictions on power beyond existential threats like war.

> opposition to private ownership

I don't personally believe that L-Lib has this as a tenet because that would be a very authoritarian concept, which is anathema to Libertarianism.

I'll point out that neither of these are economic systems. They are hierarchical structures of government. They often have developed views on their responsibility to affect influence on markets, though."

liberalgunowners,ffxbf2b,t1_ffxaxfu,1580321699.0,"You certainly have a point there. Modern medicine is still in the dark about *how* a lot of drugs actually work, only that they seem to consistently do a *thing*. The side effects of drugs are balanced against the *thing*, and we make a choice whether or not to allow its use. The problem is that we don't have the time scale to do even that properly. Drugs taken in a developmental phase in children could have massive downstream effects, but we don't let human trials go on for thirty years.

Bottom line, general chaos in society and our methods for coping are not perfect. We can do some stuff to fix objectively bad things, though."

I think the problem is cultural. We don't have enough social ties to prevent someone from falling into the spiral that becomes violent. Sometimes, the drugs are more of an ex post facto argument.
