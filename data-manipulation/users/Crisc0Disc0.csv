The winter can be hard for people with depression or anxiety issues, I know it is for me.  It's good the see you are eating better. Are you working out? Running is where it's at for me. It's important to note that you may just have a rose-colored glasses point of view of your time high.  I don't know how long you were smoking, but after over a decade smoking I didn't get high anymore.  It wasn't pleasurable in any way, but my anxiety skyrocketed if I didn't have it.  I'm feeling a lot more even these days.  I'm glad you're keeping some self-awareness about not replacing weed with alcohol, because I think that is a common issue with people quitting.  Try to find a new hobby, whether it is working out or something artistic or something that gets you out of the house.  It takes time to replace weed with other things.  Good luck."

calculus,fehf00h,t3_ep5f5q,1579115178.0,"Hey, fellow testing anxiety sufferer here.  A few words of advice:

\- Practice for tests under timed conditions.  This will help to desensitize you to the panic.

\- See if you can seek accommodations through your school for testing anxiety.  I spent 2 years with time and a half on tests that really helped ease the panic. My last semester, I elected to forego those accommodations but due to multiple semesters of less-negative experiences and becoming better at managing my anxiety, it was OK.

\- Practice conscious relaxation techniques before and during tests.  If you start to panic try this:  Name in your head 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can touch.  This is a mindfulness technique that was super effective for me.  Also try alternate nostril breathing.

\- Be aware of the actual ramifications of ""failing"" a test.  I went to an extremely tough engineering program where the tests were literally impossible to finish in the given time. But they curved.  I spent an inordinate amount of time hyperventilating about my grade without actually being aware of the actual results of doing poorly.  If you do fail a course, you can retake it.  Try to put less weight on the outcome of your test and realize that failure, no matter how small or big, is how you grow."
