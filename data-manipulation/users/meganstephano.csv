wholesomememes,fg31q7d,t1_fg31b3x,1580466263.0,"are you good?opioids are in *painkillers* not psychotropic medication! i told you i knew about the epidemic, i never said opioids werent addictive? this wasn’t even your argument from the start. your beginning argument was that psychotropic medication was *more* addictive than opiates. find me some links for that, will you?

edit: when i said “scientific research told me they weren’t” i was referring to you asking who told me antidepressants werent addictive"
wholesomememes,fg30msl,t1_fg30j17,1580464709.0,"yes, the opioid epidemic is due to painkillers containing opioids. scientific research has told me they weren’t addictive? i’m beginning to think you’re a troll, this is getting kind of old. i trust people with doctorate degrees in this subject  more than i trust a stranger online. i’ll continue my meds, but thank you~"

wholesomememes,fg2yh4u,t1_fg2y3rg,1580461629.0,"i thought this might be an anti-pill thing.  i’m in no place to judge my mental disorders on my own, but i’ve been to multiple mental hospitals, and gone to multiple psychiatrists, they all say the same thing: major depression, bipolar depression, generalized anxiety disorder. i’m not sure where you’re hearing “more addictive than opioids” there are painkillers that contain opioids, maybe that’s what you mean. most psychotropic meds are not addictive, with the exception of anxiolytics, stimulants, and hypnotics, which are for extreme cases. but even  those are not as addictive as opiates."

wholesomememes,fg2xj7j,t1_fg0wgwz,1580460306.0,"i mentioned i had diagnosed mental disorders in my comment, which i do struggle with. they’re suggesting that mess will help with that disorder, in overcoming my symptoms. therapy builds coping skills and tools i can use to help myself detach from her issues. side note: i’m a girl."

wholesomememes,fg0o7jj,t1_fg0dbgs,1580411768.0,"this hits be for me. i just got my GED and license (i’m 17) and now looking forward to college and a job, but i can’t seem to get anywhere. i’ve gotten interviews only to bail, and i spend most of my time in bed. granted, i do have diagnosed mental disorders, but my mom is constantly manic (literally, BP I) and attacks me about my situation. she says shit like “i went to college i got a job, your friend is going to college, she got a job” it makes me sob tbh. i’m scared to go out into the living room, i stay up all night so i can feel comfortable when she sleeps and avoid her most of the day. of course if i criticize her in any way she’ll get extremely defensive. “YOU CAN BLAME ME ALL YOU WANT BUT SOME TIME OR ANOTHER YOU NEED TO ACCEPT THAT THIS IS YOU, NOT ME” 

i’m hoping to push myself to get a job, and save up some money so i can move in with some friends, craigslist people if i have to. i just want to leave, but i can’t seem to start taking the steps to independence. this made me feel a bit more validated about me being a piece of shit, haha, so thank you."
niceguys,fg0jyqc,t3_ew528c,1580409320.0,"i woulda said “i’m going to call the police to get you baker acted, obviously you’re extremely suicidal and need to be hospitalized.” i think that might’ve snapped him out of it. in all seriousness, this looks like BPD (borderline personality disorder) behavior, he probably needs some kind of therapy."
