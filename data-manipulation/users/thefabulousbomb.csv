offmychest,ffifzli,t1_ffietoe,1579972967.0,"She does have a brother called Demetry, unfortunately though he now lives with friends. Onion broke (and eventually lost) her leg a few months ago and can no longer go outside, so we ultimately decided that he would be better living with friends in a bigger place where he can outside and has another friend to play with. My SO and I would love a cat but Onion’s mama (also our housemate and landlord) isn’t even sure that Onion would be cope with another cat in the house. So right now DONKEH is a dream cat"
offmychest,ffiallz,t1_ffgyx9g,1579969297.0,"Ours (Onion) likes to sit near us when we’re busy and meow. Then as soon as we look at her she turns away, it’s like she’s giving us permission to pet her. ..."
offmychest,ffgvopm,t3_eti9mh,1579916246.0,"Do we have the same cat? She meows constantly, but doesn’t even want love and attention, she just wants to meow for it. I’ve started meowing back now."
aww,ffgvjkr,t1_fffnnfe,1579916142.0,My housemate had to literally grind up her cats antibiotics and mix them into her food to get her to take them because she did this. We couldn’t even wrap it in ham or anything because the cat is weird and doesn’t really like human food.
toastme,ffgodlu,t3_etcu91,1579910977.0,"Hey buddy, I was actually in hospital around this time last year for the same thing. I won’t say it gets better, I won’t say that there’s a giant light at the of tunnel. 

What I will say is this: Admitting that you’re not okay is the first step on a long road to healing. The hospital will try and get you help, don’t refuse it, they actually want to help you out, you can get help to ease the pain, to diagnose anything that might need diagnosing. There are people that want to help you het better, and there are people that will pick you up everytime you are down. You can get through this, sometimes it will feel like you’re trying to run through water, but any movement forward is still movement."

notliketheothergirls,ffe2tbz,t1_ffe21pv,1579835227.0,No problem
notliketheothergirls,ffe0km8,t1_ffe00eq,1579833587.0,"I imagine she probably doesn’t feel great, her new albums have mostly been about acceptance and love, she clearly still has some adjustments to make in regards to moving forward, but she actually seems like a better person now.

I’m in a better place, thank you, but moving on from that situation is hard, I had therapy for 6 months and I still struggle daily. Sometimes I wake my SO up because my nightmares get intense and I wake up shouting or lashing out, thankfully he’s a saint and is sticking by me."
notliketheothergirls,ffdzbz7,t1_ffdyu1b,1579832689.0,"I’m not saying it does, but speaking as someone who grew up in an abusive situation it is an easy route and thing to do. My siblings and I used to physically beat each other because that’s what our parents did, it was a way for us to regain control. Then as I got older I would do awful things to myself and people around me so that I would “deserve” the abuse I got."
notliketheothergirls,ffdyq20,t1_ffdpjvs,1579832250.0,"May or may not be true, but it all when she was under a crappy contract and being forced to do the same thing for someone else regularly. So if it was it was probably a way for her to take back the power of what was happening behind closed doors.

It’s a common thing for people to do in abusive situations, it makes them feel like they’re okay."
notliketheothergirls,ffdye6f,t1_ffdwqq7,1579832012.0,"Still is, her new stuff is amazing"
notliketheothergirls,ffdya3e,t1_ffdfcv5,1579831932.0,"I hate her old stuff but her new stuff has actually been really great (in my opinion), her first album after she got out of her contract with Sony was amazing. She fully addressed the entire situation and wrote an incredible song (Praying) about breaking free from the abuse. Her newest album is being released next week and everything so far has been a blend of the old party tunes and her new look on life, she’s shedding the image of everyone feeling bad for what she went through and she just wants some good old fashioned debauchery (her words)"
offmychest,ffd226v,t3_esvl1h,1579811877.0,"UK here and job hunting, honestly same. Especially since I mostly do my job hunting on my phone when I’m out and about, I don’t want to be redirected to a website to fill out the same information, especially since 99% of the time it doesn’t read my CV properly anyway so I have to change everything on the webpage so they have the right information."
Tinder,ffc041o,t3_esqk2b,1579788090.0,"What an asshole. Also why did he match with a black woman if he doesn’t want to be with a black woman?

AskReddit,ffah7np,t3_esc8vq,1579735668.0,"It’s my birthday today, I would make it special for them. It’s pretty much the age where I began hating it, so I would do her makeup for her, give her a dress to borrow, take her to the cinema, then buy her some dinner (or make a nice meal) and just make her feel special."
