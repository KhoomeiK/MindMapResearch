antidiet,ffprx9l,t1_ffpoaoh,1580103524.0,"Something interesting I read (of course can’t find it now) was that most if not ALL of the supposed “weight-linked” diseases are more accurately linked causally to weight *cycling* not actual weight; and also the experience of long-term stress associated with weight stigma. So all this shit we are blaming fat people for, is actually caused by the harmful cycle of dieting and exacerbated by the daily judgement and fat-shaming. Christy Harrison’s book “Anti-Diet” takes a deep dive into this, highly recommend!"

antidiet,ffpfiov,t3_eufv0d,1580093776.0,Yeah I was blown away at how my PMS eating vanished when I started this. It really makes a ton of sense that so-called “emotional eating” is really just a reaction to restriction.

antidiet,ffmwfw2,t1_ffk6bcd,1580059661.0,"Yeah this has been tricky for me, I used to obsessively meal plan so that I would have “no excuse” to eat junk. I used meal planning as a weapon to coerce myself into eating a “perfect” macro-balanced calorie-minimizing amount. I had to throw the meal planning out the window for a few months in order to re-establish a healthy relationship with it. Just recently, I’m able to see meal planning as a form of self-care - as a working mom, I need to plan ahead so that everyone is fed and happy and not scrambling at the last second to slap together a meal."
antidiet,ffmvopu,t3_eu1haq,1580059401.0,"Make sure you are FULLY feeding yourself - lean into it HARD. I know it seems nuts to even contemplate after years (or decades, in my case) of chronic restriction, but I really think this phase is completely crucial. When I first dove in I ate a STAGGERING quantity of food, mostly “junk” that I hadn’t allowed myself to have, for a full six weeks. If I was thinking about it, I ate it. It takes awhile to convince your body that this isn’t just some weekend binge that will be closely followed by yet another restrictive period. And then after about six weeks I started wanting vegetables. Open tubs of ice cream sat in my freezer for weeks. I still eat cookies, but I have one or two, not the whole box. I’m about three months in now and food is still important to me, but does not consume anywhere NEAR the quantity of bandwidth that it used to. And has NONE of the emotional baggage attached. It’s very neutral. I don’t praise myself for eating a salad nor do I punish myself for eating a doughnut. It’s just food. I feared that I would never stop eating, that I’d eat the whole world and explode and turn into a black hole, but this *is* the way out."
intuitiveeating,ffmtoef,t3_eu7oy9,1580058756.0,"Yes it can - but at the core is a need to tackle the root cause (your need to look fit). If you’re wondering if this is a good way to get shredded, you’re in the wrong place!"

intuitiveeating,ffj1jzm,t3_etvgt9,1579988065.0,"I’m right there with you. Having a tough day today. I’ve been IE for about three months now and the food part clicked pretty quickly. After 20 years of the restrict/binge cycle I was in a dark place back in October; trying to do low-FODMAP, Paleo, low carb, AND IF all at once - ugh. 
It was really a fork in the road - I was either going to go all-in on a full blown eating disorder or I was going to throw in the towel on all of it. So I threw in the towel. 
I feel way less anxious and generally more calm and present now. But I’m also struggling. Struggling with putting clothes on this new body; struggling seeing myself in the mirror. I’ve been working on neutral thoughts and also reminding myself that I wasn’t happy even when I was very thin. 
Today I panicked a bit - going out with friends I haven’t seen since gaining weight and really scared of what they will think of me. Also have nothing stylish to wear and only feel OK-ish in giant poncho like sweaters. 
I’ve been repeating to myself that dieting is just a bandaid; for real change, you have to get at the root of it. It’s fucking hard and it’s going to be awhile I think before I feel really good about it."
AskWomen,ffhd6e4,t3_etgo51,1579930535.0,"I’m 35 and wouldn’t go back to my 20’s for all the money in the world. Sure maybe my skin looked a little better but can’t think of one other benefit! I love my career, financial security, and having all my poop in a group, sure - but the best part is the confidence, consistency, and authenticity with which I show up, day after day. I used to be a hardcore people-pleaser, changing my facade depending on who I was talking with, in hopes they would like me. Now I DGAF and am much more likeable. Through meditation, therapy, and coaching I’ve more or less conquered my multi-DECADES long disordered eating and body image obsession. I feel..... CONTENT and it’s way better than always seeking the next “great” moment."

But I was doing it all in a punishing, obsessive, unkind way. I was forcing myself to go to classes despite feeling exhausted, pushing myself too hard, and doing it strictly for the calorie/body shaping benefits. 
I basically stopped exercising completely for two months. And then in December, I woke up DYING to swim. And went swimming because it feels amazing to move my body. And then i wanted yoga, and then running. I’m slowly getting back into it all but in a sustainable, healthy way. And only doing things I genuinely want to do.

Two steps forward, one step back. There are days you will feel awful in this journey. Stick it out - it is worth it. And something that really helped me out recently is that it’s not like I am throwing in the towel and “letting myself go”. I am just putting body goals on the back burner right now in order to find some balance and reclaim my mental health around food and body image. It doesn’t mean I will sit around eating chips and feeling sorry for myself forever and just buying bigger and bigger pants until I move into tent territory.

I also heard something today from my coach about how it doesn’t mean throwing away body goals forever. It means putting the weight loss on the back burner while you sort out the mental health aspects of your health and your relationship with food. Maybe I will start a fight here because some of the HAES stuff is really black and white on “intentional weight loss is always bad” etc but this was *exactly* what I needed to get thru my head today. I had been feeling like once I dive down this IE tunnel, there’s no turning back and I might gain weight forever (unlikely anyways!). So this I think freed up some of the anxiety there. I’m not “letting myself go” I’m just taking some time to deal with my extreme shit with food and body image.

antidiet,fekq9cm,t3_epkt0x,1579205368.0,"Ahhhh ok I watched it. And most of what she’s saying actually kinda makes sense:
- that dieticians should meet people where they’re at, instead of telling them they’re wrong for wanting to lose weight; that maybe HAES for one client and intentional, gentle weight loss for another might be the right choice. Because rejecting a client who wants to lose weight could drive them into the arms of sketchier diets etc which could be actually harmful 
- that there are people out there who restrict and diet without negative effects, everyone is different 
- that gentle nutrition can incorporate things like adding more veggies, etc, that “might” have the end result of weight loss but that we don’t actually have control of this anyways.

She’s definitely fence-sitting here but I think it’s an important conversation."
