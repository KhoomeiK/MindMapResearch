AskReddit,ffflcht,t1_ffevheb,1579886448.0,Is this just a story or is it a legend from another culture?
rocketbook,ff4rf66,t1_ff2oapb,1579570636.0,That would be good. I use paper or my laptop for taking notes in class. It seems like you have a good system
rocketbook,ff16zsm,t3_er41tt,1579475871.0,"I like using my rocketbook for most things. I use it for writing notes to myself and for brainstorming. I also use it to rewrite my lecture notes for studying and to get it on my google drive when I scan it. It would be good for math because it has graph paper. The only thing I wouldn't use it for is taking notes DURING class. The reason being, when taking notes I find myself writing extremely fast to keep up with the prof. When I write fast, I push down further on the paper. I'm afraid with the extra ""push"" I'll leave ghosting. That's just me though."
Coffee,ff0l1hx,t3_eqyn9x,1579469824.0,I used to add a bit of salt to my coffee to cut back on the bitterness. You would much less than sugar and it wasn't as bad for you. But eventually I became accustomed to black coffee. I just added less and less until I didn't need anymore.

Advice,fetv205,t1_fetumem,1579380325.0,That's best. Just be supportive. But don't interrupt her.
Advice,fettx1d,t3_eqlz28,1579380035.0,"I would just wait until she is done with her call and then go see if she's ok. Be supportive. But don't do it while she's still on the call or she might get mad at you as well. Are you a younger sister or older?

Edit: maybe bring her some tea or a hot drink she likes? It'll show you care and are there to listen even if you can't give advice.

DO NOT tell her to calm down. For all you know, she was cheated on or is being broken up with. She may also be having an anxiety attack because of it so don't tell her that. You need to be calm and she'll calm down."
whatsthatbook,fesr8h6,t3_eqgira,1579368164.0,That sounds really intense.
Coffee,feotvrd,t1_feojzya,1579305414.0,That's crazy. I also have 12hr shifts and I drink 10oz over maybe 2-3 hours. by hour 7\~ of my shift I feel I need a boost.

Coffee,feos6b8,t1_fenuv26,1579304666.0,Thanks! Can I ask what time you go to sleep for the night if you wake up at 4?
Coffee,feorhcd,t1_fenog0c,1579304425.0,That sounds like what I do.
Coffee,feonry4,t1_feo6mbw,1579302657.0,I had a teacher in high school who would use her keurig 1-2 times per 1 hour class and finally someone asked her how she drinks that much coffee and she said it's just hot water. It kept her hydrated and felt comforting.
Coffee,feond17,t1_feo4unw,1579302561.0,That's usually when I'll make a second cup of coffee or some tea for an afternoon boost.
Coffee,fenj7bj,t1_fenj1zv,1579285845.0,That makes sense.
Coffee,feni3cw,t1_fengjrx,1579285166.0,So you make your coffee at your workplace not at home?
Coffee,feni0ox,t1_fenggrg,1579285120.0,That's great you do things before your morning coffee
college,fenh7gz,t1_fengu7u,1579284617.0,I've never heard of that. But I notice they usually post my classes monday the week school starts. It used to stress me out. School starts next week for me and there's nothing posted.
college,fengi47,t1_fenfw1s,1579284185.0,ohh lol ok I though maybe it was a winter class but canvas wouldn't put spring. it's always really good about that.
college,fenfrc7,t3_eq3jkl,1579283733.0,wait that says spring 2020. did you finish the class already?
college,fem9ng1,t1_fe6aohf,1579244943.0,I used google sheets. I just did the days of the week across and the time by half hour down. Then used color coding to fill it in
keurig,fee65xn,t3_eog65d,1579027209.0,Just fill it when it looks low.
college,fe5tm4c,t3_enrdiv,1578874662.0,I'm legit the same way. I have a week left and I'm like trying to relax to a point where I'm stressed about not prepping and stressed about not relaxing.
college,fe5c3ms,t1_fe59qn3,1578867551.0,No it's not on the transcript. I'm not sure how it works exactly. I'm from Nevada so it could be different based on location
college,fe58vrr,t1_fe58bvd,1578866626.0,Most teachers make attendance around 4-5% of your grade. But I was referring to graduate schools. Almost all only accept people with 95% attendance. They get that from your current school.
college,fe56ud0,t1_fe55rrc,1578866143.0,Lmao really? No we pay for classes and textbooks. We have lab/tech fees worked into our class price but if you only take the class once then you only pay it once. I couldn't imagine paying extra fees on top of that just to go to classes. Especially that much! I'm in the USA. What country are you in?
college,fe56aao,t1_fe5617r,1578866028.0,Yes. Why would they graduate someone who doesn't go?
college,fe54dnx,t1_fe51bf9,1578865519.0,I wouldn't have less debt. I'm paying for my classes either way. It's not like I'm paying more if I spread out my classes across more time. I wouldn't have to pay for that class twice.
college,fe53sia,t1_fe504q9,1578865424.0,What graduate school would care about length of time you're in school. It's GPA and attendance that matters.
college,fe4yx7p,t1_fe4v9ja,1578864130.0,I'm only speaking about my specific school. We value GPA over graduation time.
college,fe4yq5e,t1_fe4r7pf,1578864075.0,"Statistically, most people with over 15 credits have lower grades. But my statement was only in regards to my particular nursing school. I would rather have a great GPA and spend an extra year in school than graduate on time with a lower GPA. It's only one year. It won't make a huge difference in the long run"
college,fe4yexh,t1_fe4wuch,1578863977.0,"I, as well as most people from my college, will disagree with your statement ""it will only benefit you to graduate in 4 years vs 5"" because its better to take 1 extra years and get a 4.0 than to get a 3.4ish within 4 years. It's only a one year difference and it'll help with time management and stress if you have less classes. One year won't matter in the big picture of your life."
Advice,fe4p2nn,t3_enjhwg,1578861553.0,I'm 20 and I cry when yelled at. I hate it because it sometimes happens at work or with a professor but I think it's just our response to that stress.
college,fe4ok7t,t1_fe4nehh,1578861398.0,That's smart
college,fe4og6o,t1_fe4j1ve,1578861362.0,I mostly do it so I have time placed for studying and only studying. That way I can get all my studying done without feeling like I'm sacrificing too much free time
college,fe4l4wv,t1_fe4hvkb,1578860483.0,Make one before the spring semester starts! It only takes me a few minutes.
college,fe4kwkj,t1_fe4aq0t,1578860409.0,A bachelor's degree takes most people 5 years. Of course everyone plans on 4 years but I've never met anyone who's every actually taken less than 5 years. But we all pass with As so it's worth it
college,fe4kpvd,t1_fe4ag33,1578860342.0,I get $2200 a year. For 2 semesters.
college,fe49t4d,t1_fe46jjz,1578857144.0,"A ""full schedule"" is classified at 15 credits (around 5 classes). But no one ever does that much anymore. It's best to be 10-12 credits for good grades. That's like 3-4 classes."
college,fe49j67,t3_enrprv,1578857047.0,Review what you learned that day in class at the end of every day ON TOP of studying. I usually do this by rewriting my notes. I take super messy notes in class and then that night rewrite them neatly. This has me reviewing what I learned and then I can also have something clean to study. I also don't have to worry about taking clean notes when I'm in class. I just focus on getting it all down. It also helps me get whatever questions I have from that lecture written down so I can ask next class instead of asking later on down the road. Plus they say it's beneficial to study new material within 24 hours of learning it so that covers that.
college,fe48kcl,t3_ennr3x,1578856812.0,"Grants and student loans. I get $2200 a year from just one grant purely because my dad makes less than $65,000 a year. And you can have more than one grant. It's really not hard. I dont understand why people make it out to be so difficult. That one grant pays my tuition for my nursing school and I have a $500 per semester scholarship to pay for textbooks. If I ever lose my grant I plan on getting a student loan. It sucks but I'll get good money as a nurse, I can pay it off relatively quickly."
booksuggestions,fe45tvl,t1_fdtkmc7,1578856102.0,yeah exactly. even Ron didn't believe him
women,fe3oo9u,t1_fdtgb41,1578851401.0,I wish I had that kind of confidence
RantsFromRetail,fdsuigg,t1_fdst1ov,1578708109.0,That's awesome. I wish I could do something like that without being fired.
RantsFromRetail,fdsq8pn,t1_fdsju47,1578706534.0,lmao yeah exactly. the only reasons a manager would know you is either you spend a lot of money or you're a huge pain in the ass. it's hardly ever people they know from outside the business
women,fdspz7o,t1_fdseqxs,1578706439.0,"I understand that. But I also understand that if a woman went out in a dress with hairy legs she'd get funny looks. That's what I meant by ""expected to shave"""

booksuggestions,fdsb3rl,t3_emqyx0,1578698531.0,"From Harry Potter the best relationship itsn't romantic. It's the friendship between Harry and Hermione. I love her romantic relationship with Ron and Ron and Harry's friendship, but Hermione's friendship with Harry is better than any other relationship. When he blocks himself from everyone, she's the only one who can talk to him and get him to listen. Plus she understands what it's like to not be born from a magical family."
RantsFromRetail,fdsaq4j,t1_fdsahx4,1578698274.0,"I work in a small business though so a LOT of people know their name. We just all lie and say they aren't the owner, just another employee. Then they feel dumb. Usually if they really are friends they'll say ""I'm friend's with (owner) from \_\_\_\_"" or they'll share how long they've known each other."

AskReddit,fdr3rjt,t1_fdqxzlt,1578679126.0,That's true. I'm trying to get more involved though.

AskReddit,fdr3k9z,t1_fdqy0e3,1578679019.0,True. I could spend forever just reading comments.
college,fd4jqyw,t3_ejrq13,1578168156.0,Retake it with the same prof. I had that happen to me. I hated him. He didn't teach at all. He wanted us to go and find the info for ourselves and then made us test on it. He was awful. BUT I retook it with the same person because now I had an advantage: I understood how he teaches. All profs teach differently and it takes 2-3 weeks to learn each profs teaching style. I could use that extra time to study.
