Coronavirus,ffi0yv4,t1_ffhzg1k,1579961773.0,"Best to go with official data, as rumors and opinions can spin things wildly out of control.

[Here is a Johns Hopkins](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) site that aggregates official data worldwide in a page-at-a-glance view, it's really helpful to keep things in both numerical and geographical perspective.

If the infected number was that high, these are vast numbers of asymptomatic cases. [From this Lancet paper that came out yesterday](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext), it took only 3 to 6 days from exposure to symptoms from this particular family (5 cases). Granted it could be longer with more data, however if there are 10's of thousands of infected individuals without symptoms then there really isn't a whole lot of use to worry. Also infected and asymptomatic individuals who never get sick means instead of a 3% fatality rate it would be a fraction of that.

Agree on the non-biological dimensions, how humans react to this public health emergency in Hebei as well as worldwide. Of particular note is the social media aspect of this: what bleeds leads, and we are naturally wired to attend to the horrific and the shocking. 35K deaths from automobiles in the US and no one really minds. 2 cases in the US (now quarantined, 60+ suspected cases here) all recent visitors to Wuhan and of 329M people in the US there are people who are buying face masks.

No predictions, we will see how well China is able to put a lid on the spread by limiting the travel of some 57M people. There are some very unhappy citizens in Hebei right now (rightly so) and Xi Jinping has a genuine crisis on his hands."
Coronavirus,ffht5ib,t1_ffhpede,1579952591.0,"Yes there were 80K deaths in the US in 2017 from a respiratory virus - influenza. We accept that, as the people who die from the flu are very old, or already very sick, or very young.

The reaction to posts and images (like this one) is that it grabs our attention, humans are wired that way, no matter the level of education and training. I am shocked by the number of well-meaning Chinese friends who wanted my spouse (a Chinese national) to not travel to China, even though there was no Wuhan travel in the itinerary. 

I tell my friends if my spouse gets 2019-nCoV I will buy a lottery ticket. Of course my spouse will take [adequate precautions per the CDC.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)

MERS had a 30-35% fatality rate, SARS had a 10% fatality rate, and it appears that 2019-nCoV has about a 3% fatality rate. The alarm and concern by people is due to how we are wired to react to unknown threats."
Coronavirus,ffhsu9v,t1_ffho2q7,1579952128.0,"Not OP, however after some digging at the [CDC.gov](https://CDC.gov) site [here is a list of protective measures against 2019-nCoV](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html).

List of 'everyday habits' to help prevent spread of respiratory viruses below. (Does not include the use of face masks by the way).

* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.  If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand  sanitizer.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
* Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
* Stay home when you are sick.
* Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

IMO the use of masks in Japan, Korea and China are more a social signal that they are taking precautions. Hopefully they are doing the above steps first!"

relationships,ffhruui,t3_etoz8u,1579950638.0,"If I may summarize in a few bullet points:

* Boyfriend 'gets you' and often mention fun with him
* He doesn't care to improve while you do
* Dead bedroom for 6 years
* Relationship at a standstill for 4 years, some talk of marriage and you are waiting
* A person from your past shows what you are missing

A marriage is not only about fun, it is about growth, it is about physical affection, it is about connection. You are getting only a small part of what it means to be married - and living together should be seen as a 'trial run' of what that kind of life would be like.

Your bad feelings are normal, and you sound like a generous and kind person not wanting to put your partner through the pain of breaking up. 

But.

This is YOUR LIFE and YOUR FUTURE and you DESERVE THE BEST. So don't settle for 'fun', even though this person understands you and entertains you. It is like you have one part of a successful marriage (you get along great, have a lot of fun together) but many other critical parts are absent or incomplete.

Beware of the 'sunk cost fallacy' as well. Seven years is a long time to spend with someone, with the hope / expectation of marriage and kids. If anyone woke up today in your shoes (regardless of the past length of time), what would they do? They would end it and move on, it doesn't matter if it was 7 months or 7 years.

All the best to you and your future. You deserve a great one.

conspiracy,ffbsj42,t1_ffbrjwz,1579781112.0,"Agreed on the threat level, have followed this reasonably close (relatives in China however not Wuhan) since last Sunday when the ICL's MRC published [this extrapolation](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/) when China's official number was only 42 cases. And I believe it was this analysis that caused the government to open up and change their tight-lipped stance (the first US case apparently returned to the Seattle area January 15, he got ill only last Monday).

Two things: one is that many people may be infected but do not show symptoms (not a lot of testing is going on with asymptomatic individuals at present due to expense of testing but real-time PCR tests are now available), two is that the fatality rate (depending on the divisor used) is a fraction of MERS (30-35%) and SARS (about 10%); 2019-nCoV (the current name of the virus) is about 2%.

I am not saying they should not be preventing scenarios like that, however to blanket the country with bans on movies seems a bit too much. In the Wuhan area and surrounding environs YES.

This is awesome how you feel this way - congratulations! Many who have done so don't feel as you do. I moved out at 19, and there were a few things I had to learn.

* Cooking.

You have rent to pay, you are working, you gotta eat. And you are **not** going to live the rest of your life eating out - that's for special occasions and to spend time with others, not a daily thing, even for lunch. So you gotta learn how to cook. 

One way is to use YouTube or /r/eatcheapandhealthy ; I would recommend a tried-and-true method, a book instead. I learned using Betty Crocker's binder [https://www.bettycrocker.com/cookbooks](https://www.bettycrocker.com/cookbooks) and two others I have are the Joy of Cooking and the New Best Recipe (from Cook's Illustrated) but these latter two are for all the background you will ever need. (There are cookbooks for those starting out, but alas I didn't have the internet back then.)

* Saving

As mentioned above if you don't cook for yourself you will spend a ton of money better spent on other things. Like your future self. There is something called living below your means, which will serve you well your entire life. As a broke student (I went back to school in my late 20's) I will never forget the feeling of sending off a $2,000 check into an IRA, when that money was so hard to save.

No matter how little you think you are earning remember there are many people who get along fine at a fraction of whatever you earn. And if you can just live on 5% less than what you take home, or 10%, you will be way ahead of others. So buy a used car instead of new, share an apartment with roommates or move to a cheaper part of town, ask for a raise at work or change jobs to get more income or work a side job, and put something away that you do not touch. Heck just automate that thing with automatic withdrawals.

One book I read early on was Clason's Richest Man in Babylon. Its a short read but some very powerful lessons there. Much later, reading Millionaire Next Door, is the result of the lessons of the Clason book. 

* Everything else

You will be amazed how quickly you can outfit what you need, and you don't need to buy it all new. Ask your family, friends, family friends, whoever if they have a spare X to give away as you are setting up a new household. You will be surprised how many people you know will have a new or barely used X, and Y and Z, and will give it to you especially as you tell them what a big step it is for you. Back in the day there were barn-raising and roof-raising parties for neighborhoods to celebrate new milestones. 

I still have pots and knives (and a few pieces of silverware) decades after moving away from home (thanks mom!) - so much of that stuff people have multiple numbers of (and many time hardly used too). Of course thrift stores can be a gold mine.

On that note, one thing you may consider is after a few weeks to plan a 'open house party'. Invite your family and friends with a 'Ninjarro is celebrating his recent move with a party!' - and heck have people sign up to bring drinks or appetizers or dishes and make it a potluck (gotta watch the budget). Nothing like celebrating a milestone with a party, and they will likely bring a house gift of something you could probably use.

Best of luck in the new adventure!"

AskMenOver30,ff4v23s,t3_equpf8,1579573129.0,"Hi OP, I see I'm late to this, and looking back I was like this for a lot of my 20's and 30's.

Those insecurities are hard to shake - feeling unworthy, feeling like people are so much better / smarter / richer / higher position than you are. And that can be a driver for the sucking-up behavior.

And the fear of rejection, the fear of conflict, the fear of ridicule is real.

Funny thing happened in my 40's though, especially as I became a 'veteran' with a lot of (well-paid) specialty experience in the professional life, and as I became well-established on the home front (marriage and kids will cause other areas of distinctive growth for sure).

I became much more sure of myself, much less afraid of any kind of rejection, still the kind and thoughtful person but one that did **not** care what others think of me.

(There was a thread a week ago on /r/Redditforgrownups about[what it is about getting older that rocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/eoe5mt/what_have_you_learned_about_getting_older_that/) \- and for me it was just not giving a damn about what people think.)

I do believe it is a function of maturity, and of perspective - and no, it isn't a lack of martial arts. FWIW I earned my brown belt in Judo at a young age, and was still about as insecure and afraid as before. 

If you haven't read The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck he talks about the need for personal growth, and the fact that changing the outdated maps takes a ton of work.

AskMenOver30,ff4thti,t3_erm9gg,1579572064.0,"The big question is what you want - yes you feel you need to 'start doing the stuff everyone else is doing' but is this what **you** want?

Yes you are enjoying your life now, and I can easily see how you are openly wondering not so much 'I should be doing what everyone else is doing' but more like 'what does the future look like - just me wandering around seeing the world and meeting lots of people'.

At the age of 33 I was single, and living abroad (originally from the US) for a few years. I knew that 1) I was going to repatriate back to the US and 2) I wanted a spouse and eventually children, as well as the conventional markers (career, house etc). 

While abroad a met a ton of people who lived a peripatetic life - that rolling stone that gathers no moss. One older guy I worked with abroad, he was in his 60's, was a caricature of a boor. Plenty of stories, plenty irresponsible, and made me wonder when I was his age if I'd want to be him. And the answer was 'hell no'.

You are free to live however you want, and do whatever you want. You do not need anyone's permission to live like that boor, or to live a 'conventional life' with a spouse, and a mortgage and a car payment, or to live something altogether different.

I can certainly relate to a ticking clock, in the US it seems as if (for a male) the social pressure ramps up from your mid-30's and upwards if you remain unmarried (either a committed bachelor-for-life or there's some reason people point to). 

I'd say to make a conscious choice to go after the things you positively want, and it sounds like while you say you are satisfied with your current lifestyle you are now wondering if the grass truly is greener. 

I can say I'm glad I'm not on the way to being that 60-something expat boor."

For a new virus to jump species, yes it involves mutation in the original species that enables cross-species transfer. Different flu viruses we humans get incubate in pigs and cross over to humans ('swine flu') although it is relatively rare it did happen in 2009. The term is 'zoonosis' - [here's the Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis#Lists_of_diseases) with a list of diseases, it's pretty long. HIV came from a variant of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, originally found in primates.

What is alarming (from the news you refer to) is the popping up of diseased individuals in Japan and Thailand (three in total) who have traveled to Wuhan but claim they did not visit the market in question.

And frankly China has not been the most open about this (this has been seen before), claiming 41 total cases; the analysis given some assumptions of person-to-person spread has been given as the aforementioned 1723 cases as an extrapolation by the Imperial College MRC center for infectious disease as a [preprint here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)."

Regarding re-adjustment, I am of the firm belief that it all depends on the parents' attitude, situation, and the child's personality (in that order).

One friend from college grew up in Brazil; turned out his dad was the head of a multinational auditing firm's division covering all of South America, and when he returned to the US as an adolescent teen (IIRC he was about 13 when he repatriated) he had several 'legs up' in both outlook and opportunity.

Another story, from a former director of mine in a F500 multinational; she was the daughter of a diplomat in Austria then Germany, raised in Europe and repatriated when she entered a private high school. Unique perspective and outstanding manager etc. 

All the best to you and the family."

When I moved to the area (I live in the 'Rockville/Bethesda Potomac', not the 'Posh Potomac', alas) with small children I was told about the 'Four W Schools' listed above (Whitman, Wootton, Winston Churchill and Walter Johnson) were the ones to buy into. Their respective feeder schools (middle and elementary) are top schools. These drive home prices, as other posters in this thread indicate.

One 'gotcha' in state school scores is the presence of Magnet Schools that will skew the averages and results; for example Richard Montgomery has a large International Baccalaureate program, Tacoma Park MS is a math/science magnet, etc."
books,fedzpga,t1_fedvv9p,1579023289.0,"I agree with this assessment; some of the words have fallen into disuse, just like in Shakespeare you need to have interpretation in the margin to assist with the understanding and comprehension; that being said alternative translations abound (e.g. New American Standard  or New International Version) where you can do a cross-reference if anything is confusing.

As literature, the King James Version does stand alone in terms of the beauty of the language, that the other newer translations try their best to capture. And some of the errors that have crept into the KJV have been clarified or ironed out in the newer translations.

Good for you to give it a go. I myself am trying to get my own children to take my admonishment of the importance of the Bible as literature, but (so far) am speaking to deaf ears.

OP, very few people have their lives figured out when they graduate from uni - don't be so hard on yourself.

Would recommend you do something with other people instead of laying in bed and distracting yourself by yourself. Coffee or tea with a friend? Attend a meeting around (insert interest here)? Hang out at a bar or nightclub? Start a new hobby by taking a night class?

> my point is. Don't let reddit and other social media make you feel guilty  

Indeed - what good advice. FOMO is a real feeling and social media amplifies it.

Perhaps its a function of my own getting older and perhaps a little wiser, I just care a **LOT LESS** about what other people think than just a few years ago. Security in my own ideas, opinions, and standing has lot to do with this. That and the fact that I've been a reader for most of my life has meant I've learned a TON more than my non-reading friends and acquaintances."
RedditForGrownups,fedt409,t1_fedpzj9,1579019319.0,"> I don't see it would help. 

This is part of the problem right there - you have access to a **FREE** resource and you give up before even trying.

Of course it's not like you'll be able to get your spouse to join you - I'm suggesting **you** talk to the counselor to 1) get all the stuff off your chest even if only to feel better and 2) talk to someone with experience and resources to help you handle this in other ways than you've been doing so far and 3) come up with stuff that you could do independent of the spouse that doesn't want to cooperate.

Heck many marriages end over this, if your spouse doesn't care about that well what can you do but end it.

As an aside I have talked with my spouse how expensive divorce is, in terms of the overall financial situation, and how it just destroys assets like nothing else. One high-powered couple we knew in California had three $400 to $500/hour lawyers on one side, against two $300 to $400/hour lawyers on the other, battling it out over custody, the house, the furniture, you name it. Crazy to think that every hour cost them about $2K, just like that, hour after hour throughout that messy process.

I am too cheap to get a divorce, FWIW."

There are several other moving parts that you do not mention, in addition to your parent's needs, and your own happiness: How does your spouse feel about the move in general, apart from these first two things? How do you view the benefit to your children, in terms of how they would make the adjustment? (I have to presume they've lived the past 7 years here and depending on age the US may be the only country they know.) How do you see the benefit to your career and future prospects, and would it be for a given timeframe or is it open-ended? And perhaps one more to top it off, do you see this as something permanent or temporary - do you see your entire future as an expatriate?

I subscribe to a newletter called the Daily Dad. A few days ago was this gem:

>The one job of parents is to give their children a childhood they dont have to spend years of therapy processing. 

I've given this some thought, and what a valuable piece of advice. And it works for your relationship with your own parents - if they've messed up with you, well what do you really owe them now? - as well as with your kids - you really want them to be well-adjusted people.

I found a [weblink to the article here.](https://dailydad.com/its-a-low-bar-but-you-better-clear-it/)

Best of luck in whatever you decide to do.
