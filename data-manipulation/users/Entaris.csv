sysadmin,ffppoj9,t3_eud759,1580101409.0,"So. Based on the other replies in this thread I feel as though I’m going to be thoroughly disagreed with...BUT. First things first don’t stress so much. 

Anything without ssl/tsk should have it. That is the top priority. But self signed certificates are FINE. they arent great, and they suck to manage but they are fine. SSL provides two services: encryption and identity. A self signed cert doesn’t provide identity but it still provides encryption just fine. If they are internal network traffic only apps then identity is less important. Fix these things, but don’t lose your mind. The biggest issue with a self signed cert is that they are a pain to manage, as long as they aren’t about to expire you have time to test out some options and find the right solution. 

Regarding the rest of your post many others have offered great suggestions I just wanted to remind you to take a breath and don’t let the people shouting “WHAT ARE YOU DOING EVERYTHING IS BAD!” Stress you out. The biggest sin in system administration is trying to fix something NOW with no care for how they fix affects the future. If you need to rely on self signed certain for a while while you plan out and implement a solution that is going to make your life better going forward then that is what you should do. It will be ok."
funny,ffnr26c,t1_fflv4ie,1580069609.0,For a short stint in life I worked at a feed store in Texas. While there I got to know an ex bull rider named Darrel. Now Darrel was the Kind of cowboy that liked to tell stories. That is to say: he was a cowboy. His best stories always started with “Now before I tell this story I must say: there was Jim beam involved”. Whenever he said those words you knew you were in for some laughs.

gaming,ffn943l,t1_ffmck1l,1580063278.0,"Yeah. When i was younger I worked in GeekSquad and I helped a guy put together an updated rig to plug his flight sim stuff into. During the course of that he mentioned that the Flight Sim stuff was a good way to ""scratch the itch"" when he couldn't get out inn a real plane. I offhandedly mentioned ""oh, I've always wanted to learn to fly a plane"" and his instant reaction was ""don't. It would be cheaper to just go out and get yourself addicted to heroin""

Apparently its expensive :P"

AdviceAnimals,ffj932i,t1_ffj7i2k,1579993337.0,"Yeah. Insanity wolf would be like “ girlfriend I confronted about her cheating laughed in my face, spent 6 years psychologically breaking her so she can never feel laughter again”"
