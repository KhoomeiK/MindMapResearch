thesims,fe7nus4,t3_ensmgn,1578917192.0,Sims 4 Pets are fun as hell. There is a stray tuxedo cat with a gentleman's hat running around named Mayor Whiskers (I hope he is named the same in english) and he won the Lottery in my game
cats,fdzqb4z,t1_fdx6f8q,1578793332.0,"I dont use the furminatore more than once every Two weeks since ist not ment to be the only brush. Especially with long coated cats it can be not so nice when they have knots (like with human hair)
Our cat is confused when we brush him and starts to clean himself with makes the whole process harder but he tolerates it. His sister dislikes brushes but goes crazy for brush gloves. Maybe try one of them since its basically cuddle time with grooming"
cats,fdzpp0u,t1_fdw8esw,1578792984.0,What? Really? I could build a new cat after brushing our Coonie mix
