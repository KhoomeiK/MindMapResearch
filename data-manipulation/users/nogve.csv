AskMen,ffhr0ra,t3_etcmuk,1579949333.0,"Black mirror. Some episodes were really good but most were awfully predictable . I was so disappointed because they have such a great platform to subvert expectations... Since the characters are not reoccurring literally anyone can die or be a bad guy, but they rarely used that to their advantage"

spicy,ffew47k,t3_et4qan,1579868003.0,"Curious as a person that never tried... How do you eat them and how much of it is edible? I’m guessing the shell gets peeled off like and orange , and the legs get ripped off... as well as the head and heart areas.. but that doesn’t leave much space right? Also do you dip it in something or did the flavor it’s Cooked in remain?"
explainlikeimfive,ffevvll,t1_ffce3lo,1579867738.0,This doesn’t explain the other components of the breathable air. Nor does it answer the initial question and show how close it is to matching all of the components or just the top X components

worldnews,ff90xj2,t3_es5ol6,1579702059.0,"Eh - don’t blame coke here, blame regulators. I’d coke used glass bottles usability will go down a bit and price would go up a bit . I feel that they should at least give options: 40% stock plastic, 40% stock glass, 20% some very eco friendly material . The prices would vary and I feel most of the market would stay with plastic, but at least they’d be trying"
madlads,ff90cjw,t1_ff8uwpf,1579701599.0,Yeah it’s a fat person thing for sure. Most people wear seatbelts and feel no discomfort but I’m betting since he looks overweight in his picture that it makes it less comfortable ... still a dumbass
lifehacks,ff2pa8d,t3_eqw0f9,1579517611.0,Most public libraries are closer to metro areas right ? So every time you stop then you’d have to go further away from the highway . Also most public libraries require a library card for parking or else you pay out the butt

savedyouaclick,fex7fdq,t3_eqs3px,1579425982.0,The real tip is color coding if you have a lot of emails coming in. I color code my emails to be light gray if I’m in the CC box - meaning I should read but have no actions. If I’m in the TO box and it comes from director level or above I make it RED. If  the body of the message starts with my name I make it orange. Then after that I tag by project- for categorical purposes. Automated emails to me like JIRA  remain black.
