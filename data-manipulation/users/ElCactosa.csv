I first went to my local hospital where they did some blood tests and a CT Scan before being informed I would need a (free??) ambulance transfer into a big Sapporo hospital. The ambulance came with the rolling stretcher, and literally as I laid down on the stretcher one of the counter staff runs over and asks for my credit card. It's such a bizarre feeling literally having to pay for my health and wellbeing up front in that manner. I don't know how people who don't have public healthcare deal with it so easily?

If I had the option again I would almost certainly have rebooked my 2 flights back to the UK for asap and flown home to have treatment there, even if that would risk sepsis or much worse pain. The hospital itself was great to be honest, but the strandedness I felt when I got discharged and was asked to pay 1.4m Yen upfront was almost physically sickening, especially because my insurance were being pretty non responsive too."

XG simply isn't, it's a mishmash of maybies and potentiallies. It's shows nothing of relevance because it can't even quantifiably define what it is - how can you rate what shot should be goal? Could be a goal? Would be a goal? XG is a statistic that people are clinging too as the hip new thing, but it just doesn't show anything reliably. 

I am more than aware of how XG is made and meant to be used, and I have still come to the conclusion it's pretty much bollocks. 

>very good indicator of a team’s overall performance

Championship,fc5dhmv,t1_fc5csis,1577454259.0,"It's not as though it's only got minor faults though, is it? 2/24 teams are in the correct positions. XG pretends to know what it's talking about, but if you look at it for longer than 5 minutes then you'll find it's pretty much a nothing stat. 

Football unfortunately just has waaay too many variables to make stats like this a viable indicator of pretty much anything. The stats simply don't correlate to the result."
