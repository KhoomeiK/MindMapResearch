insaneparents,ff209ay,t1_feyf1jb,1579490367.0,Hello (former) fellow metro Phoenix. My first brand new car got swiped by one of those famous homeless vans. My roomie and I lived in a gated area but there was no need to push the gate as a drunk smashed a huge hole in the block wall. Almost a year (and two vehicle break ins) later it was fixed so people would just prop the pedestrian gate open. Gave me a whole new disrespect for the safety of gated communities.

aww,fdrd9b9,t3_emmfak,1578682871.0,My kids go to the same school and whenever they're both lined up with their classes my youngest breaks off to go hug his brother then rejoins his class. The teachers are very cool to allow it.
trashy,fdr6bbk,t3_emkp3t,1578680124.0,Maybe handling business loudly and publicly would show that it isn't tolerated and discourage future incidents. If everyone knows it isn't tolerated fewer will be tempted to try. Handling business quietly behind closed doors gives the outward appearance of tolerance.

TwoXChromosomes,fchnlcg,t3_eh26i3,1577652091.0,I never married my children's father but five years and two kids in I find out about his hidden child that he and his family knew about all along. It's best to find out early and have a clean break. I'll live with his lies for years as he won't do any kind of child support for me or the other kid until courts are involved. My heart goes out to you. I hope time and distance help heal you and make you stronger than ever. You know your worth.
