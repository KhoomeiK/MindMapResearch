WTF,fel2hxm,t1_fekxzat,1579212641.0,"One of my kitties was picked up swimming in the floodwaters of Hurricane Harvey, down in Texas. Rescuers were out in boats looking for stranded people, and he just swam straight to one of the boats. Suffered a really rough bout of congestion, there's no telling how long he was in the water, but nothing a good dose of antibiotics didn't take care of. Nowadays, he doesn't really shy away from water in general (for instance, he might jump up on the counter while I'm doing dishes), but obviously we'll never test out if he actually enjoys swimming, after he had to deal with that situation."

Showerthoughts,fei1nmz,t1_fegjym0,1579128328.0,"Yep. I taught my dogs a few voiceless commands, kinda to test if this was true, and it totally is.

Edit: One bit of advice that we have learned with our own pirate - be very vocal with them. Faris has learned to be able to follow our voices when we're calling that it's feeding time, or if she gets disoriented (other eye isn't that great and she can't see well in the dark), but she will follow our voices, no problem."
