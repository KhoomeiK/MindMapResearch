depression,fedq4q4,t1_fedadpl,1579017465.0,"It really is a matter of how you feel about the terrible things that happen day to day that makes life seemingly bearable. It's not being ignorant to how shitty life is but knowing that life is shitty and accepting that, and not letting that decide how you feel. Don't get me wrong, I definitely want to die A LOT LMAO, but, I believe this is how the healthy people do it."

depression,fe33791,t3_enmoli,1578845495.0,"Wanting some sort of companionship is completely normal and understandable, but it's not a necessity. You can be okay with and prefer being alone, it's just a matter of how you feel about it. Maybe you're just more introverted and having plenty of alone time in school is what you'd rather have? Honestly I'm in the same position as you but I really like not having any super close friends at school, that way I can hide for days and no one really cares lmao. BUT. If you feel that you prefer having close friends and spending time with them maaaybe join a few clubs or ask people from class to study with you? That's honestly a pretty effective way to make friends cus you have a common interest to discuss together and it's a (sort of) effortless way to make friends. Idk to what extent you've gone to meet people or what exactly is causing you to feel lonely, but hopefully that answers something for you?"
