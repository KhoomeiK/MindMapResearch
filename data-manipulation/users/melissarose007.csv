bipolar,ffu0v1u,t1_ffsapdd,1580232070.0,It is!!! Lmao.
bipolar,ffs9zfn,t1_ffs95vi,1580176755.0,"Yessssss. It's like even though I know ( kinda) I'm not staring death in the face, that doesn't matter to the anxiety. I've been diagnosed with bi polar 2 since I was 15. I'm 31 now but I have never had anxiety before this.  After talking to my psychiatrist, I got meds to help, and am learning coping strategies.... Without that, I'd be in the emergency room every day."
bipolar,ffs01im,t3_euwj1p,1580169842.0,"I just got diagnosed with a blood clot... I'm on medication for it... But I had a super severe attack because my toe was cramping last night... I don't know what could have triggered yours to come back.... But I do know that sometimes nothing has to happen to trigger our episodes... It just happens. Maybe talk to a professional and try to get a handle on everything sooner rather than later.  I'm sorry you are experiencing this. But with the right help, I am sure you can find a way to manage it."
ChronicIllness,ffpe0ki,t3_euev4i,1580092695.0,OMG. The cane one. I'm 30... (But am told I look much younger) and use a cane for post thrombotic syndrome.  People get so freaked out... Lol
Anxiety,ffjncqi,t1_ffjn9ac,1580002242.0,Pm** no on. Auto correct.
Anxiety,ffjn9ac,t3_etzeyi,1580002176.0,Hey. I have anxiety that stems from a recent medical diagnosis.  Whenever I have an anxiety attack... My blood pressure and heart rate skyrocket. I get dissasociative and have chest pain and chills. I  talked to my mental health provider who prescribed me something for the anxiety. I have an appointment set up with a therapist to learn how to cope with the anxiety. My only advice is to get help from a mental health prof. Your symptoms are like mine in way of anxiety. And you have been checked out physically...  So with the right help from professionals I know you will find a way to manage your symptoms. It also helps to have someone to talk to when you are freaking out. I'd be dead if it weren't for my husband. If you need someone on me. I am not always online.. but I will do my best to respond. Just....... Don't give up. You will amaze yourself with what you can achieve once you learn how.  Anddddd... You'd be surprised how simply being alive can make such a positive impact on somes life. You can do this.
Anxiety,fffwq65,t1_fffq8tt,1579893473.0,No... It's not.  I made sure to ask. Lol.  It's the anxiety.  But it's very real. It helped me to see that some one else experiences it too.
Anxiety,fffodsk,t3_etdrof,1579888292.0,"Hey... yea. The same thing happens to me. I just got diagnosed with a blood clot... and although i have had bi polar disorder my whole life... i have never had anxiety until now. I get these chills and my heart races and races...  even if i feel like i have ""calmed down"" the chills and racing heart beats take a lot longer to go away.  
No advice here. I just wanted to let you know you are not alone. Its really scary. And im sorry you are experiencing this. Hopefully your drs will find something that helps you."
aww,ffcnw8a,t1_ffar1jq,1579803460.0,She is so cute. As is yours!
ClotSurvivors,ffbkjxg,t3_es6nwb,1579769733.0,"Omg. I have an ovt too. I also am very overwhelmed and in debilitating pain..

 They think mine was caused by birth control and developed in my ovary because it is suspected i have endometriosis as i am not postpartum or post op. I didn't get any pain meds and my primary care doctor said he had to google the condition.  So needless to say i am looking for another
 Im on xarelto now and see my hemo for the first time on the 28.  I can honestly say im super freaked out. I hope we both get the answers we are looking for soon. Best of luck. And im so sorry you are going thru this. It sucks!!"

AskReddit,ffaf7n9,t3_esc8vq,1579734320.0,Introduce her to her future husband and kids.
BipolarDisorderReddit,ffa42qp,t3_esgiix,1579727476.0,"I use marijuana in place of lithium. (I am also on celexa.) i can honestly say that I prefer it.  I do still experience my bi polar 2 symptoms... But with proper self care and self awareness, I'd say I'm doing very well. The best way I can say it is that although marijuana works... Its not as ""strong"" as lithium. ( Which is part of the reason I like it.) I do not depend on ANY MEDICINE to completely eliminate my mental illness.  I just try to do what works, recognize when it doesn't, and  be open to shifting into what will. If that makes any sense. 
It's been 5 years since I have been hospitalized.
Talk to your mental health professional and be honest.  Keep your head up, and you will find your routine. There is no cure and management is just that. No matter the meds there will be bad days. And there will also be good ones.  
I think you should be proud of your self awareness and your efforts. hold on to that. And keep trying. I have confidence you will find where you need to be."

funny,fevqeib,t1_fevq0ej,1579400247.0,"Im fine now..
 Definitely a bit crazy.. but fine..I just cant stand people making light of what rape actually is... awful. I will stand up againt rape being joked at in any form. Its never funny. Its not a subject one should be allowed to joke about. At least not without being harrassed by a crazy person afterwards ."
