guitarpedals,ffba6y2,t3_esomf8,1579757060.0,"Current board - really happy with everything now, actually don't see adding any new pedals (HA!) Only thing I want to change is to move to an actual metal board/iso power supply mounted on bottom etc. for now powering with 2 one-spot wall warts.

New pedals are the EHX Canyon and Oceans 11 with a Mosky Tap Switch. So, cheap-o pedal board no more, I've now doubled the cost of the board so far.

Guitar is '85 Carvin DC-150, amp is 1989 Mesa-Boogie .50 Caliber+

Chain:

1. **Morley Volume/Wah/Dist** - Had this thing forever, decent wah pedal but the vol/dist are useless.
2. **Donner DT-1 Tuner** - Nice little tuner. Easy to read, even sideways. Great for the price.
3. **Joyo Dyna Compressor** - Always-on. Have always used a comp, I play a lot of clean lead and love the punch it adds to the tone.
4. **Rowin Noise Gate** - Always-on. For the price, can't be beat. Works perfectly.
5. **Mosky Silver Horse** - Klon clone. Really, really happy with this pedal - and, after all the discussion on here about using klones for a low-gain in front of other pedals, I'm super surprised at how good this thing sounds on its own with the gain up a little more. Especially with the neck pickup on single coil.
6. **Mosky Obsessive** - OCD clone. Sounds great, and even better with the klone in front of it. Rich, creamy smooth overdrive.
7. **Donner Morpher** - Suhr Riot clone. It's a Marshall in a box. Great lead tone and 80s metal rhythm, again even better with the silver horse feeding into it.
8. **Joyo American** - Hand-painted by my daughter! Everybody knows how good these things are now. For me now it's an always-on pedal with the gain just at the break-up point so I can still use it for clean stuff. Seems silly to use an 'amp/cab simulator' into a Mesa-Boogie, right? Not silly, it just adds so much to my tone I can't go without it now. 
9. **TC Electronics Thunderstorm flanger** - it's a flanger. It does flanger-y things.
10. **Boss CE-5** - Just found out this must be the analog version, as I've had this since the 90s. It's a great chorus.
11. **Donner Yellow Fall delay** - Great little delay, I use this mainly for that colorful analog fullness to solos. 
12. **EHX Canyon** - Just got this puppy, and it's a little daunting to dial in, but I wanted a digital delay with tap for fun delay effects and it does all that and more. got a Mosky Tap Switch for 18 bucks to control.
13. **EHX Oceans 11** - Y'all know what this does. It's miles ahead of the Donner Verb Square I had here. Again, a lot to learn.
14. **TC Electronics Spark boost** - doesn't actually fit on the board anymore, but I'm ok with that as I needed it to be easier to stomp on for solos. 

off the board:
The afore-mentioned Verb Square, the only one of these cheap-o pedals I didn't like. Just didn't have a pleasant tone and every setting sounded almost the same.

Joyo Uzi - actually really like this pedal, but I'm not using it in the current band I'm in, it doesn't really stack well with any of the other pedals, and I needed the room. Still have it if I want to djent on my own."
