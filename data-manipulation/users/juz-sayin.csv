depression,fekfebx,t3_ephb69,1579198896.0,1. It’s not “lazy.” 2. Dep saps energy.

depression,fedejv4,t3_eofgj0,1579009342.0,Your life is not about other people. It’s about you. You’re not obligated to hand over your power to anybody else. Your life is your own.
depression,fede3xq,t3_eofgoa,1579008968.0,I relate. I understand this.

Menopause,fedda0w,t3_eo1o9o,1579008262.0,Thank you so much for your post here. I’m glad you are finding great ways to feel healthy. Spirituality is a huge part of it. I am into Eckhart Tolle. He sparks the spirituality for me. I will research yours you mention and again thanks.
depression,fedcy8f,t3_eo55m9,1579007973.0,Agreed. It irritates me when people call it cowardly. I believe it’s an eye-opener to all of us how deeply painful and heart-wrenching it actually is.
Menopause,fe9kre2,t3_enxb4c,1578938723.0,"If the patch doesn’t relieve your symptoms, maybe try the pill form. It has worked better for me. I take 0.5 dose estradiol daily (at night). Acupuncture and yoga are my favorite ways to cope. I hope you find healing soon."
marriageadvice,fe4u34h,t1_fe477yc,1578862774.0,Completely? No. I suggest seeking marriage counseling.
marriageadvice,fe46ry6,t3_eng7qa,1578856295.0,"Cutting to the chase, you’ve got two options: 1) stay and do some serious ass-kicking and 2) leave and do some serious ass-kicking."
lonely,fe45wyk,t3_engfp6,1578856124.0,Self-comforting in any form is healthy. Until you find that special person I see no problem in this at all
lonely,fe45p8d,t3_enjuvf,1578856064.0,"I got myself a stuffed animal. I’m fully adult, but I believe many of us have memories of this comfort from childhood."
depression,fe44zl4,t3_enfyh1,1578855830.0,I relate. The bitch of having dep and anxiety is low self-esteem. Sux. And that questioning yourself is a real pain. I try (doesnt always work when I’m in a very low mood) to cope by reminding myself that this is part of the deal and it’s that speaking. Many times I have to be reminded by a close friend or loved one to actually call me out on my thinking error and I’ve learned to defer to their logic since I know full well it’s the depression.
funny,fe43p3f,t3_enjryx,1578855508.0,Looks funny but I see a strangle toy. Would have to watch that carefully.
marriageadvice,fe43aw7,t3_enj1jp,1578855378.0,"You made a mistake. We all make mistakes. You owned up and that’s the right thing to do. The fallout is out of your control now. She’ll think, feel and do what her conscience dictates. Your job is to do the same now. Stay strong with who you are in learning a tough lesson and let that help you be a better man. What she does is up to her. Ball is in her court and if you stay you have to do all the repairs from the damage. If you end up splitting up, there’s life after divorce."
depression,fe41b21,t3_ennlc5,1578854824.0,"My thoughts on suicide notes: the dead don’t speak. The note is written in the moment. The moment passes whether you’re dead or not and who knows what the dead feel after the fact? Remorse? Relief? As for saving your family and loved ones, there’s no suicide note to fix the permanent hole that the suicidal person just shot through their life."
marriageadvice,fe3yxsd,t3_enl9u4,1578854139.0,"I react by thinking two things: 1) go ahead! As in I call his bluff. And 2) that’s grist for the mill. As in that’s an earmark there’s some stuff we need to work thru. So if your S.O. wants to stay and work it out, it’s time to head to the counselor’s office or if he/she is serious, it’s out of your control anyway."
marriageadvice,fe3y2qq,t3_enqtoz,1578853928.0,There’s research backing the idea that the honeymoon phase wanes about two years into the deal. You’re normal.
AskReddit,fe3w24k,t3_ennslu,1578853397.0,Real world is somewhere in-between your lowest and highest expectations.
AskReddit,fdli573,t3_elq6wb,1578524529.0,Yes and glad you’re addressing the commonality of it. We’re all bound to have those moments in life and as frustrating as they can be it’s at least great to share it here. Thanks for posting
ChronicPain,fdlhvas,t3_elz1qo,1578524357.0,"This line and the quandary of wondering how much to talk about it with my friends and loved ones keeps me guessing too. Even when I hear “I’m sorry” from others I think to myself how much more lonely it makes me feel, adding to the psychological pain on top of the physical pain. Ugh!"
marriageadvice,fdlh9z3,t3_elyit9,1578523992.0,"I’m not an expert and there are even times when I think I completely suck at being married but for what it’s worth I’ll add my own two cents. Unless you’re in an extremely abusive relationship (if you believe you are, get out now and don’t look back), first, is to believe that you could do a lot worse by calling it quits. You sound like you’re working on yourself thru counseling and you’ve both gone together too. That says a lot. And I say that’s worth the effort. Second, be transparent with your mate. No secrets. No passive-aggressive maneuvers. This is no guarantee on how your mate is or will be but it will alleviate conflict within yourself. Realize that in your marriage it’s not about your partner’s happiness, it’s about yours. That’s not meant in a narcissistic way, that’s meant in taking full responsibility for being the best you can be. That heals. That helps bring you past the tough times."
ChronicPain,fc6cba5,t3_egewj3,1577477236.0,"The body won’t lie. I can relate to your experience as I used to behave and think like this in my past around Christmas time. Not any more, thankfully, and I’ve actually been able to enjoy the holidays by being more careful. I hope you feel better soon."
depression,fc6bl6j,t1_fc57ow1,1577476763.0,That’s a lawsuit right there. Your healing could come in the form of prosecuting this therapist. Go for it!
ChronicPain,fc2132f,t3_efot13,1577336294.0,Merry Christmas!
