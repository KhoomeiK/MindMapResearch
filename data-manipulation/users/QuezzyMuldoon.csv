I mean there are so many being abused in nice homes all across the continent according to you, you shouldn’t have any time at all to be bored.

instant_regret,ff2hik1,t1_ff2f1n1,1579506374.0,What I did was save him from death...you seem like you’d be happier if he did get euthanized. You’re sick...you should probably stay away from animals if you’d prefer them dead over being rescued. Get help.
