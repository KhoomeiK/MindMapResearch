We’ve done Green Chef for a few years now, and while the quality has gone down a bit recently since their change in ownership, they still have some cool and creative flavor palettes. I also like those services for sending out the little dash of this or that spice/seasoning that you would never use in its entirety from the store, but they send you just the right amount to make a unique dish for one meal."

To him, it wasn’t about eliminating the dark side of the force. There wasn’t any balance to only having the light side of the force to Jolee, so he left the Jedi order. He was an interesting character for calling BS in the way he did when it came to what “balance” meant in the force."
