WritingPrompts,fdphomr,t3_elpzvm,1578628905.0,"According to steam I have clocked an astounding 1,050 hours in the life-draining MMO, Lift. I decide to log on, last night was pretty crazy after all, I think i handed out several millions in currency as part of my celebration. I completely and utterly beat the game, my dear Dixie, the most powerful tank in the game, none come close to her ability to withstand damage, she can even beat elite DPS characters just on stamina alone, regardless of her own subpar damage output. I pull up the game and skip past the usual splash screen and character select, however, something is immediately off. The savage glow of my max level equipment is absolutely engulfing my monitor.

The mouse wheel screams as I attempt to pull the camera back, I was in the arena, why would my camera be zoomed in to the point where I cannot see? The camera buffets with disapproval of my abuse of the scroll wheel. Strange.. I sit back in my chair and take in the scenery, or lack there of.

What should be a low-poly mesh filled in with different shades of green underneath Dixie's foot is instead, low-poly 2x4s, a wooden floor. Where the heck did I log out at last night? I can't immediately recollect any buildings you can enter, I mean, its a old game, the anime graphic barely conceals it's age among the clubbed hands and floating feet.

I'm really stumped, but nevertheless, I lean in, but before I can reach my keyboard and mouse the camera moves on it's own, not an idle animation I've ever seen. Even more perplexing is that Dixie also began moving. It becomes clear she is in a house, I've never seen one in the game before but i can't take my eyes off of my character as she moves to a slightly more open spot of the home. The camera frames her up, front and center.

""Thank you for all you've done"" she began to speak, ""Now that I've come this far, I think it is time that we part ways. This broken world, I intend to unite it"". 

""Broken?"" I squeak.

""The 7 continents used to be one at some point, you know? I believe that by reuniting the broken pieces and making the world whole again, something will-no, MUST happen. Something incredible."" she continues.

""I never read any of the lore, but that sounds pretty far-fetched"" I remarked.

""Doesn't matter what you think, I'm going to reunited the continents as one, and I'm going to kill a lot of people to do it. Their sacrifice is necessary. I believe it is the lives of the people themselves that prevent the continents from mending themselves. So many people with such great power. It interferes with the world's natural energy. This is where we part ways.""

The thought of losing Dixie after all the many hours i poured in overwhelmed me, before i could stop myself i interjected. 

""Now wait just a moment! If I'm going to responsible for creating a weapon of mass destruction, then i may as well see it to the end, besides, I've never been the villain before.""

Shen seems to ponder for a moment, before nodding her head in agreement

""true, you are undoubtedly responsible for what is about to happen, you better not try to quit half way, you no longer control me, I will accomplish my goal, with or without you.""

Very uncomfortable and cringy on many levels for sure.

She also intentionally farted directly in my face once and i still remember the feeling of the blood rushing rushing from my head. 0/10 would not fart again"

The Ugly. Was broken up with. She fell out of love, immediately was over it and already had another crush, left to move back home soon after, and is spending time with the other guy.
