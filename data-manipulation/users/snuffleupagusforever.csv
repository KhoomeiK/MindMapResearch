My husband found me crying in the floor with our baby trying to feed her one night. I don't know why I didn't sit on the couch I think my body just gave up!  I don't have a picture from it but just know that it's hard, and I felt exhausted, and my hair was always dirty, and I didn't have that cute fucking robe that matched the baby's in the hospital, and I have double chins in like 90% of the hospital pictures that most moms have that natural gorgeous glow.

And it's still all worth it. It also gets better! Now my kid crawls around trying to kill herself instead of waking me up all night. Keeps me on my toes and I get to sleep! ;)"

workingmoms,ffc9faf,t1_ffa7rv2,1579794551.0,I thought the same thing at first! I was like wow she gives no fucks... which would make sense given that returning to work is hard!
weddingshaming,ff9nkez,t3_es5lil,1579716734.0,"Definitely not. If the person isn't worth them spending the money to attend the wedding, they don't get a gift. The fact she's posted her registry on social media is cringy AF."

TexasTech,ff6z3vs,t3_eryuik,1579637857.0,"I lived in a 3BR townhome there, it's probably because they're a bit older (I graduated in 2008, they were new then)."
weddingshaming,fen2ke6,t3_epp1ti,1579275558.0,"Devils advocate! Yes weddings suck and being a bridesmaid is a PITA. But she probably bought the dress to lessen your stress/things to do. (Though knowing your size seems like common sense...) But look at the destination part like a vacation for you and fiance! Is it at least somewhere cool? Hopefully she won't micro manage every minute there and y'all can actually have some fun.

Does she expect you to go to the civil ceremony? I think there's nothing wrong with her planning it that way as it's her day, but she has to understand it's \*her\* most important day, not everyone's, and accept that people may not be able to attend. If it's anything like the JP wedding we did it's quick and easy, and certainly not worth anyone driving 5 hours. But, family is complicated so I get supporting your fiance. Sister in laws huh?? As if regular sisters don't make you crazy enough!"
workingmoms,fen1tdu,t3_epmjz2,1579275077.0,"Yes yes yes!!! Except this sentence:  ""I may not be the greatest mom in the world for being happy to work and leaving my child at daycare for 9 hours."" Taking care of you IS taking care of her so don't doubt yourself."
dogs,fen1mcu,t3_epza1e,1579274950.0,"I'm so so sorry. It doesn't get better, per se, but it gets easier to breathe. Dogs are just the best people. Take it one day, even a moment at a time."
workingmoms,feka7hd,t3_eplhrk,1579195822.0,"It's amazing isn't it? You'd think people would \*want\* to see this kind of thing, to know that the culture is changing! But I hear that kind of attitude all the time, especially from older women.

CONGRATS TO YOU!!! I'm excited for you!!"
beyondthebump,fdom9yf,t3_em93js,1578608027.0,God bless moms who jump in! Sorry your day was so shitty... pun intended. ;) Hope tomorrow is better!
workingmoms,fdom4dh,t3_eme9bg,1578607934.0,"Same thing happened to me. They hired a temp to do my job while I was out - kept her when I came back. I left them high and dry - they had no idea how much trouble they were in until I was already gone. Sorry! It's messed up they can do that by ""realigning responsibilities."""

antiMLM,fcyah1d,t1_fcy8ja9,1578077134.0,Came here to say this!
workingmoms,fcyaauy,t3_ejg7vm,1578077043.0,"Maybe an unpopular answer but - it's only been 6 weeks. Maybe he needs to adjust. My daughter started at about that age in an in home, after it had been myself and a nanny at home only, and the provider said she wanted to be held a lot. (Small adult to kid ratio made that possible.) She came home exhausted. Now she crawls all over, loves playing with the other kids, etc. Still tired but good tired. 

Or maybe I'm full of it. I'm certainly no pro! Either way I hope it improves! Prunes help us if it is constipation."
beyondthebump,fcy9l97,t1_fcxzdud,1578076706.0,How red? Like reddish purple or full on red?
dogs,fcxvnla,t3_ej93p4,1578071189.0,Oh my God I am so sorry. That's just awful. You did a wonderful thing letting her know what love was before she goes. Sending you big tight hugs.
weddingshaming,fcxvd66,t1_fcxuvqt,1578071015.0,"Completely agree! Why should guests cover because the bride decided she needed super expensive extras? I do think the plate thing is standard. But I'm not covering the cost of your 15 ice sculptures to brag on Instagram with, Karen!"

Totally joking! Good luck sir or ma'am! I hope the kids are doing well, and will continue to do so!"
weddingshaming,fcvcaj7,t1_fcv0tjz,1577999095.0,"It's clear you've done your research here and as you as you said, pros highly outweigh the cons! I'll need you to photograph and video this so that I can \*bear\* witness to it."
Mommit,fcvai9e,t1_fcuuqr4,1577998040.0,"Begging your partner for anything, especially something they should just be doing, should not be the norm and is actually pretty unhealthy. This is definitely not ""every guy/father"" because I know a ton of really great dads. That sounds like an excuse to me that it's ""just a guy thing,"" which is not a valid reason to refuse to help your partner. He may need adjustment but, she shouldn't have to beg."
Mommit,fcva9u0,t3_ej1ncm,1577997905.0,"1) sounds like he knows he's wrong because he got defensive and acted like an arse.

But 2) agree to trade off. If baby doesn't get up every night (hopefully the case!) just a quick ""hey I was up last night, you're up next!"" could help.

casa,fcoeuy5,t3_ei4nz6,1577830539.0,"Yayyy congrats on the first case! I usually speak to the placement provider first, just as a show of respect. Then I say ""I know you've met so many people; do you understand what my role is?"" Just so they're clear on who is who. I try to keep the first visit light - but that doesn't always happen. Some of these sweet kiddos are craving attention/conversation/etc. I do like to ask what I can do for them - ""put me to work, give me a top 3!"" Sometimes it's school supplies; sometimes it's visits with siblings; but I ask them to tell me what they need from me when they are older so that they feel like they have at least a little control over something in this crazy process. When is your first court date? That also makes a difference in my approach, as I need to get down to business if it's soon after first visit. Good luck! Edit: I also like to ask them to tell me about themselves. I don't assume I know just because I have a case file."
beyondthebump,fclaxm9,t3_ehpy74,1577743635.0,God that story is horrible. I can't even imagine. It's given me a lot of perspective today.

He will learn to nap at school. It will be okay! He won't hate you at all, he just needs to adjust a bit. I feel you though, working mom with a minimum 1 hour commute each way (usually 1.5)."
workingmoms,fckvonr,t3_ehplzr,1577734198.0,"I work remotely in IT. You absolutely cannot work without childcare. It just doesn't work! Kids have excellent timing. Nap for hours, the second you get on a call they'll scream. If you really plan on working normal 9-5 hours you will still need childcare. I would suggest finding a role with flexible hours so that you can work around your husband being home. It honestly bugs me a bit when people don't get childcare, because it gives those who WFH a bad name when they are unproductive."
