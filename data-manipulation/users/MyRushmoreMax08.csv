When “What’s My Age Again?” comes on the radio I always know that he is going to smack the tuning button the moment the lyrics “And she took off her pants” are sung and he always does this faster than the speed of light.

He gets angered by anything sexual and any sexual urges or feelings that he feels are seen as shameful and bad and he angrily despises them.

If nudity is in a movie or TV show he will skip past it or just stop watching. If there is a sexual/romance storyline within a TV show he will skip multiple episodes to avoid watching anything “indecent”.

Naturally, he is a lunatic and happens to be a narcissist but I digress."

Jimenez assisted twice against City when Wolves beat them away this season. He and Wolves tend to play well against the top six and better teams.

Grealish is likely the best player on the pitch against Norwich (maybe Pukki) and scored last week. Villa crushed Norwich away by four goals this season already.
