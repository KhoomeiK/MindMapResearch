depression,fegnezf,t3_eoxun3,1579097957.0,I completely get this. I would like to be better but also depression is so comforting and it’s all I’ve ever known. It would be easiest to stay this way.
depression,fdxcc5d,t1_fbamyhy,1578767376.0,"God I really felt this! I watch a lot of forensic files and true crime stuff and I just think about how these poor people had so much life ahead of them and it was cut short, but here I am literally praying to die. I wish I could trade places with people who actually deserve a life."
