Endless searching only to have your resume go into a cyber abyss. Online applications asking you to fill out questions where the answers are already stated on your resume. Being ghosted after a few interviews is a hard kick to the nuts. Online filtering algorithms are terrible. 

Tell your SO to treat a job search as a work day. Have hours and a routine. Keep track of outgoing resumes and jot down follow up dates and results of the follow up. This may seem pointless at times but it keeps SO communicating. Recruiters ask pretty much the same questions so use it as practice for a phone or in person interview. It's very easy to fall into a dark hole and go days without talking to anyone aside from you. Go out for walks in the evening and chat. Try to maintain adult conversations with other people.
