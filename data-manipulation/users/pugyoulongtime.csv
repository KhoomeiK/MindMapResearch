GERD,ffdbh30,t3_eswcc6,1579817300.0,"It didn't even occur to me that it was the Omeprazole that was making me so violently sick, just thought my symptoms had gotten worse. Decided to go off of it completely after learning how awful the long-term side effects are and have been feeling much better."

veganrecipes,ff1n2h9,t3_eqwnku,1579481907.0,"Why is there always 3 pages of useless filler before it gets to the actual recipe? This is the reason I always use allrecipes. All that aside, this recipe looks damn good."
lactoseintolerant,fezbj8d,t1_feyim52,1579455719.0,That’s pretty much me. It’s interesting how I went from being able to eat pretty much whatever I want to this. Thanks for the response.
vegetarian,fezaz4r,t1_fewzu6d,1579455521.0,"Thanks for both responses, glad there’s someone else out there in a similar situation. Will definitely look into some Indian dishes! I’ve never had any Indian food before so it’ll be fun to try out some new food. I’m wondering now if it’s soy that bugs me. There are a few foods I’ve had where I’ve noticed soy was in it (like the impossible burger) and I got extremely sick after. Thanks for pointing that one out."

legaladvice,fept627,t1_fepryvc,1579330409.0,"Thanks, really appreciate the advice. We have paperwork that does indeed say the batter is new but we’re not sure if there’s a warranty on it, we’re calling Monday to discuss. I believe at the time of purchasing it though they told us there was one on it. Hopefully we can work something out Monday."

Advice,feo73nm,t3_eq1won,1579295976.0,"For the sake of all the kids your friend may find himself around, I would definitely confirm this information with the police before letting everyone know. The fact he had over 2000 images, was engaging and wanting to meet up with children, and even had a photo of abusing a dog (I would keep him away from animals as well), tells me this guy has a serious addiction. I wouldn't put it past him that he's being super friendly and portraying such a nice image so you'll trust him with your children either now or one day. I've seen a few crime documentaries and this is common behavior from sociopathic convicted pedophiles. This guy gets off on dominance, clearly. I believe he's using you."
doordash,feo5143,t1_feo33eh,1579295206.0,"Oh don't worry I turn those $6 or less orders down real fast. In my market, a good order is $8+"
doordash,fenzoc9,t1_fenrtwe,1579293056.0,I genuinely believe this is why the average order I'm offered is $6. People can't be that awful.

doordash,fenhfnn,t1_feng9m4,1579284757.0,"Some people genuinely seem to believe that DD steals tips still and that it's better to not tip so DD makes up the difference. Found a post pertaining to someone ripping off DD on a money saving forum, then people proceeded to say they don't tip drivers for various reasons."

inuyasha,felak6i,t1_fekttxf,1579217675.0,"No it looks perfect, good job. I can usually tell with fan art that it's fan art but this looks awesome."
vegetarian,fekvs3f,t1_fekom4p,1579208619.0,"Exactly. Cutting out meat is *hard*, especially when you've been eating it your entire life and it's constantly shoved in your face by everyone around you. My husband who blatantly doesn't care about animal welfare (but cares for the environment) cut out beef, pork, and buys his eggs, chicken, and turkey from local farmers. That's a huge accomplishment, especially for the average consumer and I'm so proud of him. I would never cut him down like the people do at r/vegan, what would that even accomplish? He would just resent me."
vegetarian,fekjajo,t1_fek6jkp,1579201220.0,Why the racism and vulgarity? Calm down psychopath.
vegetarian,fekizws,t1_fekgp3v,1579201043.0,"Came here to say I completely agree with you milly. I don't even state that I'm vegetarian on r/vegan or I'm met with attacks. It's like if you're not vegan, you're dead to them even though everyone starts out as a meat eater or vegetarian, and we sometimes progressively go vegan. Shaming and being hostile towards us won't help your cause."
AskReddit,fekhqt0,t3_epj100,1579200293.0,"Soda dungeon. I didn’t think it was underrated until going to the subreddit for it and seeing that barely any people post about it. It’s such a great, addictive game. It’s basically a strategy 2D dungeon crawler but it’s so much more than that. I’m extremely picky about games yet I always find myself going back to that along with more popular games like the elder scrolls, starbound, stardew valley, resident evil 4, etc."
GERD,fekhdwt,t1_fekgenh,1579200081.0,Nothing’s painful to touch but lately the left top side of my stomach is sensitive. Antacids don’t really help. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone thinks this may be something more severe than GERD given the rib and chest pain.

vegan,fejywct,t1_feji8li,1579188987.0,"My doctors have never discussed my diet with me, it's actually surprising. Stomach problems run in my family and the most they have ever asked is how often I consume coffee/soda, alcohol, and drugs."
GERD,fejwukk,t1_fejj6z9,1579187681.0,"Unfortunately yes. The few times in the past month I went to bed not elevated high enough (but still had 2 pillows beneath me), I woke up in pain. I used to be able to sleep with 2 pillows but now I have to sleep with 3. I'm pretty much sleeping sitting up but then slide down further as the night progresses. I stopped eating after 9pm and that has helped some."
Freefood,fej8wz3,t1_ex2fh40,1579161995.0,"Dasher here. This actually isn’t true anymore and we 100% rely on tips. More than half of what I make per week is in tips. We also can’t see your notes before accepting an order, so all we see on our end is “$6 for 8 miles” or something like that. Most experienced dashers will reject that type of order."
TodayIWore,feiipav,t1_feic59k,1579139442.0,It paid off! Happy cake day.

doordash,fehigfr,t1_feal866,1579117202.0,"How much do you guys average? I'd imagine anyone living in a major city (like Toronto) would make bank, especially if you have a bike and everything is within a few miles."

doordash,fehi1xj,t1_feh8a33,1579116965.0,"Yeah the average order in my area (midwest US) is $6-8. I take anything $8+ within a reasonable distance. Not trying to make a lot of money with this; I do it passively during the week between school work to help my husband out. If I did need the money, I'd have to take low ball orders in between bigger orders to meet my goal. I would say I average $300 per week while only working 3 hours per day."

inuyasha,fegnlrh,t3_eozpoc,1579098096.0,No I totally agree with the Sesshomaru transformation; these episodes were my favorite too! The relationship between him and Rin especially was so interesting to watch develop.
PlantBasedDiet,feghjh2,t3_eowsmp,1579092960.0,"My dentist and doctor told me soda of any kind is fine once a week; my dentist recommended a straw so the carbonation does less damage to the enamel. I personally will drink cane sugar soda once per week and any other time I get a “soda” craving during the week, I’ll have grape zevia. Tastes great."
pigs,fegh3ux,t1_feg8y3t,1579092558.0,"There’s nothing cute about this industry, even if the boar isn’t getting killed right away. What do you think happens to animals in the meat and dairy industry that no longer serve their purpose? It’s kind of hypocritical too that you would be a fan of pigs and post something like this. Sorry to be “that person” but this video was actually pretty upsetting to me. Poor baby (the boar)."
toastme,fefx15a,t3_eokrx3,1579068006.0,"Wow that's amazing that you're going for your PhD, what an accomplishment! You're in a much better place than a lot of people. On top of that you're super handsome. I'm sure you'll have no problem finding a wife :)"

loseit,fef7br3,t1_fed73fb,1579049890.0,"Ah, I know that feeling... except I get that whenever I have something high in fat before bed (gerd issues). In that case, I would try getting cane sugar soda and reducing your intake little by little so you don't binge. Avoid high fructose corn syrup or sodas that are too high in sugar. If you're used to having 1 or a couple sodas per day, maybe try reducing it to 1 soda every other day if you can handle that, while replacing it in between days with gatorade, powerade, or whatever other ""juice"" you like drinking. I would make the goal 1 soda per week, which is something my doctors always recommend to me. Seems impossible at first but weening yourself off really helps."

loseit,fed0v36,t1_febkj5i,1578993054.0,"Try to set small goals and work towards them; make it a routine. I like to use this little app called bear focused timer, but any timer will do. I do 20 minutes of productive activity and take a 20 min break. It keeps you busy, makes you feel like you’re accomplishing things, and distracts you from eating. Make meal time fun! There are so many low fat meals out there that are just as good as high fat meals, and won’t make you feel like shit after. Be conscious of what you’re buying and aim for low fat, low sodium, and no added sugar. If you’re a soda and coffee drinker, opt for zevia carbonated drinks to replace coke and try pyure 0 calorie sugar to replace sugar for coffee. It tastes so yummy! Those are just a few things I do to maintain/lose weight. Best of luck, hang in there and know we’re all behind you. Stay strong."
oddlyspecific,fecry1s,t1_fdtj6qb,1578982327.0,"I noticed that. I'm a couple years out of high school (in college) and noticed a lot of the younger ones coming in introducing themselves, saying they're band members as if it's something cool or interesting. Funny how much things change."
grubhubdrivers,fea8paw,t3_eo3efd,1578945683.0,"That happened to me at MOD pizza constantly. The final time I went there I was waiting 5 minutes just for the ""to go"" person to acknowledge me, then he slowly looks at the ticket and says ""working on that soon"" or something like that, so I wait another 10 minutes as he's serving customers who just walked in, not doing to go, and gives another dasher their order right when they walk in. I finally went to the ""order"" counter in frustration and the 18 year old kid I approached gives me slight attitude while telling me to talk to the ""to go"" counter, that he can't help me. I cancelled the order shortly after that and left. Haven't taken a MOD pizza order since."
