...and when it's an issue, they give you a ""potty pad"" and instruct you to lay it over the bowl before you flush.  Apparently, (edit: some) chemotherapy drugs pass through your body without being metabolized, and they come out the same as they went in (for example, when you take an aspirin, your body breaks it down, uses it, and then you poop out something that is no longer aspirin.  On the other hand, when you take chemo drugs, it fucks you up on the way through, but it doesn't get broken down at all, and so when you poop it out, you just poop out the same chemo drugs.  I think it's the same deal with hospital food, but that's another post.)

todayilearned,ffgziz4,t1_ffgts5d,1579919097.0,">could it be feasible to begin just launching it into the sun?

Short answer: no.

Longer answer: it's actually really difficult to launch something into the sun.  It's not as simple as ""point it towards the middle and give it a push.""  Earth is orbiting the sun at approximately 30 km/second or 65,000 miles/hour.  In order to get something to free fall into the sun, we'd need to launch it with enough energy to accelerate 65,000 mph in the opposite direction (anything less, and it would just go into an extremely eccentric orbit, passing near the sun then going round behind it and shooting right back out the other side, ending up right back where it started, i.e. right in the path of Earth's orbit.)  For comparison, the fastest spacecraft ever launched was New Horizons which left the earth at about 36,000 mph, far short of the 65,000 necessary to hit the sun.

Counterintuitively, it's actually much easier to escape the sun's influence altogether than it is to crash into it.  We only need to launch a spacecraft at 11 km/s or less than 25,000 mph in the *same* direction as earth's orbit to escape the solar system."

TL;DR(ish): every once in a while, atoms can randomly pop in or out of existence, just like that.  Even once the universe has ticked down to nothingness, after the last atom has decayed into radiation, and the universe contains nothing but an endless sea of red-shifted photons, *once in a while*, something will appear, briefly, alone in the empty universe, before it too decays into nothing.  Even *more* once in a while, several of these atoms might come together at the same time to form a fully functioning brain, complete with memories of a full lifetime lived up until the current moment.  Given the vast timescales of, well, *forever*, it is mathematically [almost certain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely) that this will occur not just once, but an infinite number of times.  Some cosmologists have noted that if this is the case, human brains in the current universe appear to be vastly outnumbered by Boltzmann brains in the future universe who, by chance, experience exactly the same perceptions that we do; this leads to the conclusion that statistically we ourselves are likely to be Boltzmann brains."
