As a kid I never ever thought ""Oh wow that's really Mickey from the TV!"" It just especially doesn't make sense to when it's just a human character, can the kids not tell it's not the same person as the movie? What do they get out of it?

Plus especially in Star Wars, the cool thing about it is that it takes place somewhere else on cool planets, isn't it kind of lame that these characters are just hanging out on earth in a theme park? I understand imagination but I feel like this is teaching kids something in the wrong way. Someone please explain this for me..."

Normally filmmaking you can brush off certain details to make a better story, but that doesn't work with such a vast canon, most of which exists in the fans hearts/minds. When Mark is even saying he doesn't agree with the choices you have a big problem. They thought finishing off this saga would satiate everyone, but it just made us hungry for more things done better, now we're bitter so it'll be an even harder job for Disney to please us. Personally I hope to see the downfall of Disney, they've become the one thing they were meant to destroy."
