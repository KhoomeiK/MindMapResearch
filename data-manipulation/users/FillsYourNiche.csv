The intelligence in a species of short-lived non-social invertebrate is incredibly fascinating! There are more questions than answers about this in the literature. There actually is a social group of octopuses scientists are researching now that might shed some light on the intelligence questions. If you are interested, here is an article from last year about this *[Octopuses were thought to be solitary until a social species turned up](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24432610-400-octopuses-were-thought-to-be-solitary-until-a-social-species-turned-up/)*."

Another user asked a similar question. I'm going to put my answer to that here for you, I hope it is helpful:

Cephalopods actually cannot see in color, so they are not visually making the decision to match their surroundings. There was a really neat study from 2016 (which I should add to the bigger comment, thanks for reminding me!) that suggests they see with “chromatic blur"". Colors have different wavelengths and when the eye's lens focuses on one color it will blur in a particular way, letting the Ceph know which color they are looking at even if they can only see in black and white. It's very cool! [Here's a short blurb](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/how-colorblind-cuttlefish-may-see-living-color) on it from Science Magazine and a link to the journal article in case you have access *[Spectral discrimination in color blind animals via chromatic aberration and pupil shape](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/29/8206.abstract)*."

I actually work with insects, mosquitoes currently, but Cephalopods are something I'd love to do research on in the future.

NatureIsFuckingLit,ffwx32e,t1_ffwvdif,1580312976.0,"Thank you for taking the time to read it all! Excellent question. Cephalopods actually cannot see in color, so they are not visually making the decision to match their surroundings. There was a really neat study from 2016 (which I should add to the bigger comment, thanks for reminding me!) that suggests they see with “chromatic blur"". Colors have different wavelengths and when the eye's lens focuses on one color it will blur in a particular way, letting the Ceph know which color they are looking at even if they can only see in black and white. It's very cool! [Here's a short blurb](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/how-colorblind-cuttlefish-may-see-living-color) on it from Science Magazine and a link to the journal article in case you have access *[Spectral discrimination in color blind animals via chromatic aberration and pupil shape](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/29/8206.abstract)*."

NatureIsFuckingLit,ffws8fa,t1_ffw9qiz,1580309767.0,"Ecologist swimming in. :) Looks like this video is moving in reverse, but still very cool. If you love octopuses there was an amazing documentary on PBS called *Octopus: Making Contact*. [Here's the link to the PBS page](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/octopus-making-contact-y8dyan/20052/), in case you have access.

Cephalopods are full of interesting adaptations! My favorite being camouflage options.

Cephalopods can change the color *and* texture of their skin! It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://www.britannica.com/science/chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells found just below the skin that hold pigment and can reflect light. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://www.britannica.com/science/melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles (Chameleons), crustaceans and some insects (Dragonflies/damselflies) also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a sack of pigment (black, brown, orange, red, or yellow) which has the ability to expand. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear duller. [In this gif you can see them in action!](https://i.imgur.com/oAZQkLL.gif) Aside from chromatophores some cephalopods also have iridophores and [leucophores](http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2646). Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates which create iridescent colors (blues, golds, greens, and silvers) which you can see in [this photo](https://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/140/14/2997/F8.large.jpg) of zebra fish ([here is the journal article](https://dev.biologists.org/content/140/14/2997) for more info on that study). Leucophores mimic environmental colors, helping the squid/octopus/cuttlefish blend in with its surroundings.

What is extra awesome is chromatophores can be used to mesmerize or stun prey! [In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1T4ZgkCuiM), a cuttlefish is doing just that to keep a crab busy before grabbing it.

Aside from mesmerizing prey and camouflage cephalopod colors are also used to attract mates and warn potential predators or rivals that the organism should not be messed with. For example male Caribbean reef squid (*[Sepioteuthis sepioidea](https://www.sealifebase.ca/summary/Sepioteuthis-sepioidea.html)*) turn red to attract females and white to repel other males. Interestingly they can actually [split the coloration of their bodies down the middle to attract a female on one side and repel a male on the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YViRSgYys1o). Another example, Humboldt (*[Dosidicus gigas](http://oceanfutures.org/humboldt-squid)*) [squid will flash red and white to warn predators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NDwGAeHnyQ). If you're into Humboldt squid, Science Friday has a great article I recommend reading, [*John Steinbeck And The Mystery Of The Humboldt Squid*](https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/john-steinbeck-and-the-mystery-of-the-humboldt-squid/).

There was a [study in 2015](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/2/161.2) where scientists strapped cameras onto Humboldt squid to try to decode the communication. I didn't see anything super conclusive in the article, but I would assume they are working on it. It's a really great topic.

Some cephalopods can change the texture of their skin by manipulating [muscular hydrostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat). Hydrostats can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. [Our tongues have muscular hydrostats which allow us to stretch it out.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopus-arms-human-tongues-intertwine-for-science/) According to a [paper published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.20221/abstract):

>The octopuses [in the study] had three dedicated types of muscles that control their on-call skin protrusions, or papillae. One set are shaped in concentric circles to lift the skin vertically away from the body. Another set pulls this form together, to determine the shape—whether it will be around bump or tall spike. And a third group seems to pull the raised section back toward the surface, spreading out its base.

More on that in [this Scientific American article](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/how-the-octopus-creates-instant-3-d-camouflage-on-its-skin/).

If you really want to see something ridiculous and interesting, Science Friday had a guest on who played music through squid chromatophores! [Here is the article link](https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/playing-music-through-a-squid/). There is a video with the music in the article (the music is *Insane in the Membrane* by Cypress Hill, which really takes me back to high school).

If you are into this sort of thing you might like /r/awwducational or /r/sciencefacts or /r/fillsyourniche if you want to chat ecology with me, see my nature photography, science book recommendations, how to become an ecologist/biologist, etc. Users also occasionally ping me to interesting posts, I'm always happy to pop in."

wholesomememes,feh1s10,t1_fegll6f,1579107350.0,"Exactly. I teach college undergrads and I use memes and terrible jokes all the time. Even if they are bad my students laugh or cringe and they remember the material. At the very least it makes what can be a difficult subject for non-majors (Biology) a little more relaxed and relatable.

It also helps make me more approachable as the professor or TA (depending on where I am teaching). If they see I am relaxed and making jokes, they are more likely to come to me when they are frustrated with the material or need help. We shouldn't be wooden, monotone, educators."
