This person came up to the counter to make their purchase and I totally thought it was a like 14 year old boy.  They handed me a credit card on it and the name on the card was a woman's.

So I asked them whose card it was, because I could not accept a card that did not belong to them.  They get this irritated look on their face and say it was theirs.  I look at the card and back at the person and it hit me that this was a woman.

I totally lose my composure and say I'm really sorry, and something about her short hair made her look boyish, which was probably not the best thing to say.

After she made her purchase, she went and complained to my manager.  He comes and talks to me and says that when she was talking with him, it was all he could to do not to laugh.

When an offer is made, both parties still have to sign it.  Which means it can be rescinded.

>Nope, I think they pay players, not positions.

Then you have no idea how a team works it's cap.  Other wise you would support the idea that a team would be smart to sign all the top receivers and not have cap left over for RB's, Oline, TE's, etc..."
Patriots,fekj8yk,t1_fekgs75,1579201193.0,So you really think a team would work out a plan that involves having 10 WR's and a QB as their starting offense.  Totally makes sense.  lol

Patriots,fejtiaz,t1_fejpveb,1579185476.0,"> Right, so in 2015 why didn't they use that money to sign another tight end?

They did, Scott Chandler.  In '16 they got Martellus Bennett with Gronk on IR.  In '17 they got Dwayne Allen and drafted Jacob Hollister with Gronk on the roster."
Patriots,fejrmx4,t1_fejpyvf,1579184131.0,">Again you're basing this off the fantasy that the Patriots found out on the 26th that Gronk was retiring when Gronk posted it.

You don't seem to grasp that money is still tied up with a player no matter what he says.  Until the players status is officially changed, he salary is still allocated to him.  And there is still a cap in the off season that counts for the players with contracts that are in the top 51 of all players on the team.

>Just cause you're the top tight end doesn't mean you're going to be a top dog.

Do you think they treat WR's and TE's the same way?  He wanted to be top TE, not the top WR.  

The teams don't just have one giant pool of cash and just pick all the cool players.  They could sign the top 5 WR's in the league, but if that means they can't sign a competent Oline, it ain't going to matter much who is out there to catch the ball when the QB gets sacked every other play."
Patriots,fejpkn1,t1_fejomb4,1579182549.0,"> Can you explain how come they didn't use the TE money when Hernandez was off the books?

He did come off the books until '15.  He had 10m in dead cap between '13 and '14.

Not sure how this applies to '19."
Patriots,fejp4eu,t1_fejomb4,1579182180.0,"> You think Cook cares if he got his signing bonus money the 26th or the 27th?

A bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush.  And he would be a number 1 in NO, as apposed to a potential number 2 in NE.

>TIL there is a separate cap for WRs and TEs. Weird.

You think it's weird that a team would set limits on how much to allocate to each positional pool?  Yeah, let's pay our TE's 50m this year.  Which I guess leaves us with 10m to pay all our WR's...That's some fine planning there hoss.

And TE's play a different roll that WR's.  You can't roll them into one group."
Patriots,fejofgh,t1_fejnkrn,1579181599.0,And he was still under contract for NE.  He would have had to been listed as a June 1 cut to get his contract money freed up.
