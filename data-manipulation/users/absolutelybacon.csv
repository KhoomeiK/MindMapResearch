SuicideBereavement,fegwpqi,t3_eoqzgy,1579104230.0,"My mom killed herself 2 months ago on November 7th. She shot herself on her front porch. For the first 2 weeks after, I felt like I was just floating through life. Like I was on autopilot and just going through the motions of everyday life. I wasnt sure if what I was feeling (or not feeling, for that matter) was normal or appropriate. I've learned that nearly every reaction to something this traumatic is never going to feel like the right emotion at that moment. Confusion, anger, contempt, it all feels so awful and wrong on top of all the grief. Its definitely not the same for everyone and I think the most helpful thing someone has told me, is that there is no timeline for grief. And the grieving process doesnt make a lot of sense when you're feeling several different emotions all at once. Dont feel guilty for doing things that might give you a little reprieve from the hurt. You need to be gentle with yourself, and all the 'what if's' just make it so much more difficult. Sending love to Colorado from Oklahoma. If you ever need anyone to talk to that may know a bit about how you're feeling, you can always DM me. You're not alone, and I'm always willing to chat."
