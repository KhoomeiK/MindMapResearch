CasualConversation,ffefp2o,t1_ffeeemo,1579846235.0,"When I went to university,  I was the first girl in our family to go.  My mom was my biggest cheerleader.  Her and I toured universities by day and drank cheap wine by night. We made a 2 week road trip out of it.  The stories I could tell about that could fill a book! She said she was living vicariously through me lol. 

But honestly, those 2 weeks with her, how she lit up...she was so free and happy. That was the first time I saw her objectively as something more than just a mom or a wife.

We lied about being famous relatives of Ernest Hemingway to get a great deal on a room that he actually rented, in Tofino, BC.  We camped on pacific rim long beach park by bribing a park ranger.  We eventually got to my university, but that story isn't nearly as interesting as our road trip"

CasualConversation,ffebvyh,t1_ffebjkh,1579842514.0,"Right?! Its just not the same thing!  Last I left her, I had to get on a bus and leave and we were crying and hugging and bus driver finally had to threaten to leave without me.

But nights like these, I think about her and I just want to be hugged."
