When you're talking about something who's cost dwarfs the current entire GDP of the country, and that's JUST for the first DECADE of its existence? Yeah, good fucking luck with that. 

How do you want to pay for that? Tax the top 1% of country? How do you think you're going to generate 34 TRILLION over ten years to pay for it? You can't. MFA is a fucking pipe dream. You can't even do the economic gymnastics to get it off the ground. 

Those other ""first world countries"" you mention? What are their military budgets? Maybe 3-6 billion? The US military budget is north of 600 BILLION. Even if you take HALF of the military budget, you're still looking at funding a system that would break the entire country economically within a decade. And what other government programs are you going to beg and borrow from in the meantime to pay for MFA?

Apparently nobody told the healthy people to pay in. Most just said, ""Yeah, fuck it, I'll just pay the fine instead."" which means more unhealthy people needed coverage than healthy people who were paying in.

That's mainly because they hold themselves as a ""neutral"" country and so it would fall on the US to defend these countries who barely spend fuck all on their military. 

Maybe if we didn't have to defend these countries and carry a military defense budget north of 500 billion, we could use some of that for providing better health care. 

Just for reference:

US Military budget: $649 BILLION  
Swedish Military Budget: $6 BILLION  
Finland Military Budget: $3.1 BILLION  
Norway Military Budget: $7.1 BILLION  
Iceland Military Budget: $45 MILLION  
Denmark Military Budget: $4.6 BILLION  


So while this other countries are spending a fraction of their GDP on military, the US spends close to 15% of its GDP on its military. Why? Because when Syria gets invaded, or there's ethnic cleansing in Somalia or Serbia, they're not calling Finland, or Canada for France for help are they? No, they come to the US to help defend their countries against outside hostile forces, and we're more than happy to send our military over there to solve THEIR problems for THEM. 

Maybe if we didn't have to do all the heavy lifting to keep peace in this god forsaken hellhole we call a planet, then we could afford to siphon off some of that precious military budget for some decent universal health care."

I drove a POS car on purpose, always left the windows down or the doors to it unlocked. I always talked to the dealers and gang bangers near my house about hip-hop and old school rap like Cool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa. They always got a good laugh at the white kid in the rusted out 93' Honda Civic who was blasting ""Planet Rock"" or Eric B and Rakim ""Let the Rhythm Hit Em"" as I exited the neighborhood.

If you're just smart and lay low, stay out of there way and don't act like you want to know what they're doing, they generally leave you alone. Never be flashy with anything. Keep your own hours, and get the hell off the street after dark. If you just avoid bad situations, you should be fine.  Dress and act like you're poorer than they are. I used to have to wear a suit to work. I'd take the suit in a travel bag, toss it in the trunk, then wear a shitty three day old t-shirt, cut off jorts, and sandals (not birkenstock) when I was driving in and out of the neighborhoods. I'd get to work at least 30 min before I had to so I could change into my suit. Not the best scenario, but it kept me from getting robbed.

In general, if you have decent situational awareness, you'll be fine. I can't tell you how many times I could tell shit was about to go down and got out of there right before the gunfire started."

AdviceAnimals,fcxvzje,t1_fcxplti,1578071317.0,"A formal declaration of war allows the President full use of military power up to and including all military capabilities (read: nuclear armaments are then on the table) as well as full funding from congress. 

An AUMF gives congress the ability to regulate the purse strings so to speak. Right now there is a bill that would repeal the AUMF that was used in the first two Iraq and Afghanistan engagements and make the current administration go back to congress to get more funding for any further military action in those regions. 

The other thing an AUMF does is limits the president in the scope of military capabilities he can deploy as opposed to having the full scale of all arms of the military. Just like in Vietnam and Korea, we had a ""limited engagement"". We never had a fully scaled up military in either conflict. We only ever had a few hundred thousand in country at any time. At the peak, we had over 500K troops rotating in and out of theater. Vietnam was more of a ""containment"" conflict for us. A lot of experts say because of this ""containment"" approach and the approach of all out war by the Viet-Cong, we ended up losing this conflict. Even though by the numbers, the US lost a fraction of what the Viet-Cong gave up (close to 2 million civilians and over 1 million VC fighters).

It was the same with all the recent conflicts we've been involved in. Iraq 1 and 2, and Afghanistan were all about ""containment"" not a full scale war where the end result is usually fully conquering the enemy you're fighting into surrender. Conflicts are hard because they're easy to extend and can turn into proxy wars like you're seeing in Syria right now between the US and Russia.

Politically, an AUMF also gives the impression ""We're not really at war, we're just keeping these bad guys from multiplying is all."" so its easier to sell to the public than saying, ""Yeah, we're dropping a million troops into Iraq, we're going to turn the country into a parking lot and eliminate any and all terrorists.""
