iamatotalpieceofshit,ffrcdgf,t1_ffr5mr1,1580155137.0,"thats something i didnt know

thanks for the info

i just feel like the whole ''pro-trans'' culture end ups encouraging transitioning and massive body changes when something as incredibly personal and important as that should be a long thought and personal decision instead of a political card

in the same way that a what age and wich who you have sex should totally depend on your personal opinions and feelings"
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffrc8gr,t3_euozjs,1580155054.0,"With anything as life impacting as transitioning it’s important to take some time to really think things through. I also find it concerning how some seem to push the idea that if you’re at all gender non informing you should transition, even though not conforming to gender roles really have nothing to do with being trans. 

People who are able to rationally evaluate the consequences should be able to do what they please, but transition should be an exhausted all other options approach. It’s not right for everyone. Some people will never pass and aren’t thick skinned enough to put up with that life. The idea with allowing children to transition socially is so they can figure this all out before puberty has had a chance to start making transition less effective.  

The options are: screw over every real trans kid who managed to figure things out at a young age by forcing them to wait through puberty’s changes or let kids who claim to be trans with proper medical oversight go for it and risk some false positives.

It’s a weird situation. No option is perfect. Although I am skeptical of there being a significant number of confused children with parents willing to push them into transition for clout or whatever."

Vaults are underground and massive.The earth shifts a bit if you wait a couple hundred years and are looking at something as big as a vault. This puts stress on things and can create cracks and pores where water can seep in.

Pretty much any structure built below the water table (most vaults) is going to have pumps designated specifically from removing water from the surrounding ground so the water doesn't find it's way in. Think like a sump pump on steroids. If no one is maintaining it for 200 years, it absolutely makes sense it could fail or be unable to keep up with the increasing need to remove water."

Everyone has cards they’d like to see banned and cards they’d like to see unbanned. That’s almost never going to line up perfectly, not even within a playgroup. The point of a rule is to have an objective thing you can point to and say this is what’s allowed without having to make things personal or debating what’s fair. It puts everyone on the same page.

People just use Rule 0 as a way to wash their hands of having to address whether bans make sense or not. “IF yOu DoN’t LiKe It TaLk tEw YuOr PlAyGrOoOoP” is not a good argument.
