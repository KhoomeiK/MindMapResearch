> Section 377 of the penal code in 41 former British colonies criminalizes all “unnatural” sexual acts including anal sex between men and other homosexual acts. The provision was introduced by British colonial authorities in the British Raj as section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, and was used as the model for sodomy laws in many other British colonies, in many cases with the same section number.

> The prohibition of homosexual acts is provided for in section 377 of the penal codes of Malaysia, Singapore (see Section 377A of the Penal Code of Singapore), Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma, and Jamaica. It is the model for similar laws that remain in force in Bhutan, Brunei, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Tuvalu, Samoa, Malawi, Mauritius, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka (as Article 365 of the Sri Lankan Penal Code), Ghana, The Gambia, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. It was the model for since-repealed laws in Australia, Botswana, Fiji, Hong Kong, India, and New Zealand.

I'm still salty that my country inherited the homophobia from British colonisation and we're still trying to undo its effects today. Sigh.

When the language is literally part of the law, I think we kinda have no choice but to talk about it.

I was researching about the sodomy laws in the US and I found this as well.

> This, along with anti-discrimination laws, effectively invalidated any remaining sodomy laws, but it still remains technically illegal in 16 states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Kansas, Kentucky, Texas and South Carolina. In Kansas, Kentucky and Texas the laws solely target same-sex activity.

> While it might not seem like a problem if the laws are invalidated, this has not stopped people being arrested for the “crime” in cases which are alarmingly recent.

> In 2013, two men were targeted by undercover police in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and arrested for “crimes against nature”. In the same area in 2015, two men were again arrested for having consensual sex. 

> Although the crimes were thrown out by judges, these cases show that archaic sodomy laws and still having a detrimental effect on the LGBT+ community.

I did not mean to hurt you. 

You see, you cannot measure hurt by a boolean right or wrong. What I thought was the right thing to do or say ended up hurting and offending you. I am sorry not because I believe I was wrong for doing so, I am sorry because I hurt and offended you.

And this is how the hurt and offense principle works in practice. It's measured by the damage done to people, not by right or wrong. You can think that Kathleen Stock is right, and sure, that's your prerogative, but that's not the measure being used when talking about if people should be forced to give her a platform. Philosophers don't talk about what is right or wrong in by itself without a measure because the idea of right or wrong is always relative. The measure we're using here to determine if we should or shouldn't platform someone is the Hurt and Offense principle. Because the truth of the matter is a lot of the time, when it comes to human interactions its wrong because it hurts the other party, not just because it's right or wrong in by itself.

On a meta level, I suppose you are in fact exercising your right to not listen by leaving this conversation. And that's fine, I won't stop you.

I am deferring to people who know better than me exactly because I want to detach from letting myself get in the way of what the scientists, philosophers, and the people affected themselves are saying. I do not want to deny the living experiences of trans people by making assumptions of what they think or feel. I was low key hoping that you'd do the same to take a moment to emphatize. 

The meta conversation about the de-platforming was over because I made my case that it has to be evaluated according to the Hurt Principle and the Offense principle. 

In the marketplace of ideas and the public court of opinion you are part of the jury. Your evaluation of whether they are right or wrong is done asynchronously. The materials aka their writings are talking are already uploaded to the cloud, you can access and consume them anytime you want. They're static files and all the web pages that are available to you. 

Kathleen Stock had presented her case with her publications and writings. I have presented you arguments why her views hurt trans people on the basis of biology based on science, biology and anthropology, and u/Sarinon have argued why TERF views is wrong on a metaphysical sense, and Contrapoints have already made her case in an entire 40 minute lecture from a philosophical on why TERFs views hurt trans people. You had trans people telling you that themselves. 

All of their ideas are crystal clear. All these people are already done their talking in the marketplace of ideas. All these material are out there. You have seen the critiques. 

Have you considered that statements made by Kathleen Stock are, in fact, denying the living experiences of trans people because she's not listening to them when they are telling her that she's hurting them for all the reasons that are presented in this thread, scientific research, all published materials by trans and trans allies? I mean it's all on the internet. People have been telling her and she did not listen. It hurts because even the science said whatever she's saying is not true. That sucks, doesn't it? 

The ball is in your park now. Look at what you've written, my friend. You rightfully pointed out that there is a circular logic of you're saying she's not wrong because she's not wrong, hence she shouldn't de-platformed, despite all the people telling you all the reasons why her views harm trans people, in according to both the Hurt Principle and the Offense Principle. And the science is doesn't support Kathleen Stock too. 

We are stuck in a circular logic because you rejected the arguments presented, remember? You rejected sciencists, philosophers, trans people themselves telling you their pain and hurt from Kathleen Stock's arguments. Not on the basis that they're wrong. You just rejected them. 

Let me try to reframe this. Should you be forced to subscribe and listen to views that people have published in the marketplace of ideas when you know full well that they will hurt you? Compelled speech aka forcing people to listen is unconstitutional with a very small list of exceptions. It is violating people's freedom to their bodies, their freedom to listen, their property rights. 

Let me put it this way. In a hypothetical scenario, I publicly insulted you in all sorts of ways that hurt and offend you. Let's say I want to go to your house to say things that hurt and offend you. Should you be forced to allow me to go to your house to hurt and offend you further by anyone or any organisation? Or should that decision be left to you?

People are stopping her from speaking because she of her `beliefs` that trans women are men. Her gender is irrelevant. Her beliefs of `trans women are men` is pushing for the hurtful and harmful stereotype of trans women are just men who are ""mentally ill"". 

She doesn't go after cis men or cis women. Her views are not against men or women. Misogyny or misandry does not apply. TERF views are classic **transmisogyny** and if she goes after trans men, then that's **transmisandry** in action. That's **transphobia**. 

And yes, her views actually harm trans woman and trans men. Yes, that absolutely changes things. 

This is equivalent to saying gay people are ""actually straight"" . This echoes  back to sexual conversion therapy. You can't convert someone's gender identity just like you can't convert someone's sexual orientation. You said you stood up for gay people against homophobes. You knew how it is. You know how stereotypes work. 

Of the four sexual human attributes, `sex`, `gender identity`, `sexual orientation` are things that you are born with. `Gender expression` is the mutable attribute. People have been confusing `gender identity` and `gender expression` for decades. Mind you, the idea of a binary gender is a recent, Western and dare I say, Christian construct. Native Americans respected Two Spirit people. It's the 21st century, we know better today. 

Gender exists regardless of your personal beliefs of its existence, just like the idea of race still exists as a mode of classification that people will use regardless of our personal beliefs and regardless of scientific evidence. The fact that everyone else in the society will believe that it exists and everyone else in society will still impose their expectations of people of whatever gender on us, regardless of our own beliefs of it existence. Gender is as real of a social construct as race or money or countries or governments. Rejecting them doesn't make them go away. 

The fact that there are scientific evidence showing that gender identity can be genetic means it's more real than what we think of our skin color. Nobody is ever born thinking ""oh I'm Asian"", that was taught to us. But we eventually learn we are a man. That instinct is more primal than what we think of race. Yes, humans are complicated. Yes, we have to radically accept that complicated humans exists and we have to accept that that's okay. 

I'm a gay Chinese man from Malaysia. I know how it is living as a racial and sexual minority. I cannot deny the fact that regardless of what I feel about race, gender, sexual orientation, people will still impose their ideas of race, gender and sexual orientation on me, and I have no control over what other people think. I don't need people telling me that I am what I know I am not. 

I am sure you have heard of the word intersectionality. It's the word that means the unique combination of our attributes, be it race, gender, sexual orientation, age, location and all the attributes you'd prepare columns for in databases that makes us special. 

Trans people are gender minorities. I know you know how it is living as a minority. I think you may be hurt and you may be misattributing the hurt that you have experienced because of your specific intersectionality as being caused by feminists. Both you and I know through our rational brains that that is not true, that is not the root cause of your pain. Feminism exists as a framework to analyse intersectionality, it only points out problems in our society that we previously don't know how to make sense of, feminism did not cause them. People are desperate to put us in boxes, feminism only pointed out what those boxes are. 

I am not a therapist so I will not try to psychoanalyze you unless you want to open up to me and I am here to listen if you choose to do so, but I can tell you redirecting that hurt that you are experiencing towards trans people, towards another kind of minority, isn't gonna solve our problems."
programming,fgplieo,t1_fgp5kfe,1581007205.0,"
P/s: About the pseudo code, I think rather than a `isTransphobic()`, I think it would be better represented as a `calcHarm()`, that returns a float. Offense is just a very mild form of harm. The people in each institution can determine how they calculate harm. In public speaking cases perhaps they may be considering the collective harm, they may have a threshold of acceptable harm, or they may consider the types of harm. Of course, you can't please everyone and people will take offence, so the criteria should be determined by the Harm or Offense principle, relative to what the people in the institution considered acceptable. 

So in effect, it will be more like 

```
if (calcHarm(speech) > institution.HARM_THRESHOLD) {
    preventSpeech()
}
```

Also the `Speech` constructor should accept a `Map<attributeName:string, attributeScore:float>` where it's something like `{ love: 100, transphobia: 20.71, homophobia: 28.7 }` or whatever to be used to calculate the effects of the Speech lol. 

I'm iterating my ideas based on your feedback, my friend! It's a process!

> When female feminists start shutting up about men and saying, “we need to listen to men and stop invalidating their lived experience” 

My friend, welcome to r/menslib! Let's talk about the **Men's Liberation Movement**! 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_liberation_movement

> The men's liberation movement is a social movement **critical of the restraints which society imposes on men**. Men's liberation activists are generally sympathetic to feminist standpoints and have been greatly concerned with **deconstructing negative aspects of male identity and portions of masculinity which do not serve to promote the stories and lives of all men**.

> The men's liberation movement is not to be confused with different movements such as the men's rights movement in which some argue that modern feminism has gone too far and additional attention should be placed on men's rights. The men's liberation movement **stresses the costs of some negative portions of ""traditional"" masculinity, whereas the men's rights movement is largely about unequal or unfair treatment of men by modern institutions because of, or in spite of those traits ubiquitous to traditional masculinity.**

r/menslib are about feminist men and women supporting each other in deconstructing all these traditional ideas of masculinity that chains men like you and me with expectations that end up hurting men. 

Some of the biggest champions of Men's Liberation movement today are, surprise, Olly aka PhilosophyTube and Natalie aka Contrapoints!

> Whether sex is immutable is intrinsically transphobic

Firstly, in common parlance sex, gender identity, sexual orientation and gender expression all have different meanings. Sex usually refers to the genitals. Gender identity and sexual orientation are what people are born with. Gender expression is the style that people choose to present themselves. 

Contrary to popular belief, more and more research supports that gender identity, like sexual orientation, isn't really a choice. It's biological. 

> The American Psychological Association defines gender identity as, **“A person’s deeply-felt, inherent sense of being a boy, a man, or a male; a girl, a woman, or a female; or an alternative gender (e.g., genderqueer, gender nonconforming, gender neutral) that may or may not correspond to a person’s sex assigned at birth or to a person’s primary or secondary sex characteristics**” (American Psychological Association, Am Psychol 70(9):832–864, 2015). Here we review the evidence that gender identity and related socially defined gender constructs are influenced in part by innate factors including genes. Based on the data reviewed, we hypothesize that **gender identity is a multifactorial complex trait with a heritable polygenic component**. We argue that increasing the awareness of the biological diversity underlying gender identity development is relevant to all domains of social, medical, and neuroscience research and foundational for reducing health disparities and promoting human-rights protections for gender minorities.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323261652_The_Biological_Contributions_to_Gender_Identity_and_Gender_Diversity_Bringing_Data_to_the_Table

When you consider that gender identity is biological, like sexual orientation, I think you will understand why a lot of the assumptions and tropes that people talk about trans people are transphobic. Saying that trans women are actually men parallels saying gay people are actually straight. Saying that trans people are confused parallels saying gay people are confused. You will see a lot of parallels between sexual orientation and gender identity conversations. The same reasons why you can think something is homophobic, well the same thing you will find the answer to why it's transphobic. 

Secondly, if you think that sex as binary, let's talk about intersex people. 

> Being intersex is a naturally occurring variation in humans, and it isn’t a medical problem — therefore, medical interventions (like surgeries or hormone therapy) on children usually aren’t medically necessary. Being intersex is also more common than most people realize. It’s hard to know exactly how many people are intersex, but estimates suggest that about 1-2 in 100 people born in the U.S. are intersex

https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation-gender/gender-gender-identity/whats-intersex

Intersex people often have chromosomes that isn't XX or XY. So that's the most immutable thing, but you can't tell people's chromosomes by looking at them, can you? Many intersex people don't even know that they are intersex lol. And if we take into account intersex people, sex also exists in a spectrum. 

> Fausto-Sterling states that Western culture has only two sexes and that even their language restricts the presence of more than two sexes. She argues that instead of having a binomial nomenclature for organizing humans into two distinct sexes (male and female), there are at least **five sexes in the broad spectrum of gender**. These five sexes include male, female, hermaphrodite, female pseudohermaphrodites (individuals who have ovaries and some male genitalia but lack testes), and male pseudohermaphrodites (individuals who have testes and some female genitalia but lack ovaries). Fausto-Sterling additionally adds that in the category of hermaphrodites, there are additional degrees and levels in which the genitalia are developed; this means that there may be more intersexes that exist in this continuum of gender.

> If it's sad that I defer some parts of the decision of what you're allowed to say to other people. 

This is very simple, it's because I am not the one feeling hurt, I am not the stakeholder here. We can only control ourselves, we cannot control how others feel. And based on the rules of mutual respect and mutual support, because I am not the ones feeling hurt, so I should listen to people who are hurt, take their feedback, and adjust my own behavior based on the offense/harm calculation to the point I'm comfortable with without harming myself based on the feedback of people. If I want others to listen to me, then I should listen to others. 

If you roll out a feature to your users, 95% of your users are not affected and 5% of your users that are affected hate it, you might as well remove it because it's a net negative. Same thing with speech. 

There is always a time and place for something. I don't offend people for no reason, hence people don't have a reason to offend me. Do onto others what you want to be done to you, if people offend me for no reason, then I will have a reason to retaliate in kind.

> On what basis that people can de-platform people and claim it's just, and whether the universities that have set up or allowed an event to be hosted there and be allowed to cancel them, aka as you put it, de-platforming. 

We can measure just or unjust based on the Harm Principle or the Offense Principle. I think you understood the Harm Principle and Offense Principle perfectly. The only difference I have with you is that I do not differentiate between ""private"" or ""public"" universities. Institutions are not people, The Harm Principle and The Offense Principle applies to the people, not institutions. 

Freedom of speech also comes with the freedom to listen. People can say or not say whatever they want, people can also choose to listen or not listen. When any institution makes decisions it's the people behind them that makes those decisions, not the institution itself. The status of the institution is irrelevant. People choose to speak or listen regardless of what the institution is doing. 

Yeah but what happens when the majority of people are offended, such as when homophobia was prevalent? Then we measure it with the harm done to the minority to resolve the conflict. Minimising harm takes priority over minimising offense. 

When a public person is ""de-platformed"" they did not cease to have their rights to speak. It's just other people exercising their right to not listen. 

People are people regardless of the institutions they are in, and there is no reason for me to apply different standards based on the institution. I take a humanist approach and will always look at the effects that it will do to the human. 

We need to listen to all people, including men, women, enbys, cis people, trans people, and stop invalidating their lived experience. I'm just being the change that I want to see.

Back to the million-dollar question. Why do I support de-platforming Kathleen Stock? Because she invalidates the lived experience of trans people. I'm just giving her as much, or as little respect that she gives others. It's only appropriate."

programming,fgow4hz,t1_fgmw75c,1580989268.0,"Thank you for your response, I appreciate your thoughts and your willingness to engage in a conversation on this topic. I would like to do some housekeeping first before we go into your questions about transphobia and free speech. There are multiple topics and contexts going on here so I'd like to establish some context of which we are going to frame this discussion. There are two contexts we can frame this discussion about transphobia, TERFs and free speech -- one as what happened within this thread, and one as a broader discussion about speech in the discourse in our society today. But let's try to frame this discussion in a more organized manner. 

Let's get into the former, aka what happened within this thread. This conversation started, I assume, with you seeing that I attempted to ""shut down"" the comment that the person I replied to who ""asked"" if Olly apologized for his attempt to ""de-platform"" the feminist philosopher Kathleen Stock. 

I have two reasons to make the response I made. The first reason is that the person is bringing up something that is off-topic as an attempt at an ad-hominem attack to discredit the author of the content shared, in an attempt to shut down this thread. I am sure that we will both agree that being off-topic and making an ad-hominem to distract from the topic on r/programming does not contribute to the discussion, hence my repeated calls to ask the person to direct their woes to a more appropriate sub. 

Secondly, the person presented half-truths, in which they presented Olly was attempting to de-platform Kathleen Stock as a ""feminist philosopher"". The other half of the truth would be that Olly criticized Kathleen Stock not because she's merely a feminist philosopher, Olly criticised her because she advocated TERF views. I think we are both familiar with what TERF views are so I don't think I need to elaborate on that. 

I will answer your questions in the context of this thread. 

> * How do you determine who should be allowed to speak? 
> * Can you justify it in a simple way that people from all sides of the discussion taking place understand and agree with?
> * If not, how can you object when someone on an opposing side of another issue tries to prevent you from speaking on complex grounds that require 3 half-hour videos of explanation that nobody on your side of the discussion on that issue can understand or agree with?

The answer to these questions in the context of this thread is actually very simple: follow Redditquette, stick to the subject and the context of the sub. This is r/programming, not r/GenderCritical or r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns. Bringing up gender topics in r/programming not only does not contribute to the topic at hand, presenting half-truths as an ad-hominem in an attempt to shut this thread down is extremely bad form, don't you think? I suppose some other people who downvoted the comment may share the same view as me, aka why are we bringing this up in r/programming. 

--- 

Now, of course, that wouldn't be a satisfactory answer because your concern is actually much broader than the context of this thread or this sub. Because you actually want to go into what the person brought up, aka views concerning trans people and gender, in this thread. I suppose you are making these points because you may wonder what Olly thinks of gender and transphobia may or may not be relevant to what he thinks of the ethics of data collection and data analysis. 

I am assuming that you share similar views with the user and Kathleen Stock, aka in your own words, ""people born with penises, much as some may want to be women, are men"". I said that this view is textbook TERF and transphobia. And you would like to contest that because I would have appeared to have brought that up as part of my reasons of ""calling out"" the user I replied to, as you realise that is part of the reason why I reacted the way I did. 

So now we have two conversations happening simultaneously. We have a conversation of why ""people born with penises, much as some may want to be women, are men"" is transphobic, and we also have a meta-conversation -- a higher-order conversation (like a higher-order function, lol) -- of how I determine if the person should be allowed to speak, and how did I know what the other person are gonna say before I allow them to explain themselves. 

---

You know what, fuck it. We're both programmers, we can handle some pseudo-code. Please allow me to deconstruct the conversation that we're having currently. Our conversation is happening like

```
function isTransphobic(statement) { 
   // TODO: logic for asserting if statement is transphobic
}


class Speech {
 // whatever lol 
}

// Just a constructor
function createSpeech(statement) {
   return new Speech(isTransphobic(statement))
}

function handleSpeech(speech) { 
   // TODO: workflow on how to handle speech. 
}

const statement = ""people born with penises, much as some may want to be women, are men"";

this.conversaton = handleSpeech(createSpeech(statement));
``` 

---

Please excuse my programmer mind on trying to make sense of this lol. I think the discussion about transphobia is an assertion problem, you're asking how do we determine a statement is transphobic. I see that people smarter than me, aka u/Sarinon has responded with an excellent response of why the idea the statement is transphobic lol, aka filling in onto the `isTransphobic()` assertion function. And I think u/Sarinon has also explained why I prefer to defer (lol `defer`) the questions about how do I determine if a statement is transphobic to people who know better than me, it's because I don't live that life. Just as an aside, I'm a cis gay man, if it matters. 

The discussion about free speech is a workflow problem, aka you're asking how do we handle any speech given the nature of the speech. I have a lot to say about the `handleSpeech()` logic. I can give you an overview, of which I evaluate based on a sets of criterias. 

Firstly, we have the two concepts that make up  ""free speech"" today from ancient Greek philosophy, 

* *isegoria*: the equal right of citizens to participate in public debate in the democratic assembly
* *parrhesia*: the license to say what one pleased, how and when one pleased, and to whom

https://theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/two-concepts-of-freedom-of-speech/546791/

I will also want to discuss two principles that form the basis of evaluating if the speech should be allowed, aka  

* The Harm Principle: which states that ""the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others"". E.g. child porn causes harm, hence it is absolutely illegal and censored everywhere federally.
* The Offense Principle: which guides the standard of which every venue, space or organization can apply their own rules to moderate the space they have authority over. ""Many factors need to be taken into account when deciding whether speech can be limited by the offense principle. These include the extent, duration and social value of the speech, the ease with which it can be avoided, the motives of the speaker, the number of people offended, the intensity of the offense, and the general interest of the community."" E.g. we have PG or R rating, TV stations censor offensive words like ""fuck"", shopping malls do not allow people to be naked, subreddits having their own rules etc.

I would love to talk about these ideas and concepts in the context of the questions you have, but the conversation up until now are too tightly coupled with each other and it is very hard for me to formulate a proper response to the questions. And I don't want to give you the impression that I am avoiding talking about the things that you brought up lol. It's just that I think we should clarify the scope of this conversation that we are having haha. Too many plotlines happening together lol. I'm a single-threaded person, I'm not good at processing multi-threaded conversations, lol. 

Can you please confirm if I am representing your concerns accurately? I want to make sure we're on the same page before we proceed further. 

I would like to decouple these two conversations as two different things, and I will need your help to separate the concerns you have into two lists: one set concerning TERFs and transphobia, and one set concerning free speech. Would you mind breaking your questions down to these lists? Let's clarify the scope and I hope that by the end of this we can put them back together and you can have a proper answer."
programming,fgoqqwx,t1_fglpyoy,1580981962.0,"> Not necessarily. However, I think we need to allow 'public platforms' to operate[1]. The number one issue that I have with big internet companies is that they want to have their cake and eat it too. They claim to be a platform but act as a publisher. Anyway, when it comes to regulating internet content things are much more complicated because of privacy and the nature of the internet itself.

EXACTLY. I think this is the exact argument that AOC or one of the senators made as well, and that's a problem. The company basically argues that they are a platform or a publisher whenever it's convenient. There are many different forms of power, lobbying, negotiation, purchasing, lawyering etc are also forms of power. Jeff Bezos and Amazon lawyers are known to be ruthless. Lawyers are powered by money (lol), so the more money you have, the more lawyer time you can buy to argue your case. Smaller companies and the general public don't have that luxury. 

Facebook has 1.6 billion daily active users, they have 21% of the world population checking in on them. If all Facebook users move to a country they will have a bigger population than China. That's an insane amount of people that they have influence and power over. There are very few organizations that can act as check and balance over Facebook, EU and the American Government are one of those few. 

> To circle back to the original topic, commercials and ads aside, data gathering should be left to the user. Forcing companies to clearly state what data they gather (like in Europe with the GDPR) is a good idea IMO. But that's it. Beyond that point, it's between the user and the service provider.

Yeah, I totally agree. Of course I think there should be enforcable guidelines and standards that these companies should meet as well because as previously discussed, there are levels of which people can be informed, and there should be stanards of how the data are being handled, stored, encrypted, anonymised etc. There are a lot of ways the GDPR can be improved. 

As an aside, wow, we have reached a consensus without arguing our heads off! That's so rare on the Internet! Lol

> For sure, it's a whole different discussion. Very difficult to say if the 'marketplace of ideas' is a bad concept, but even if it is, it's difficult to say how we should deal with ideas. I mean, if ideas aren't to be expressed and criticized freely, are we to create regulatory bodies to police ideas? How else do you find out which ideas are good or bad? With scientists and experts, perhaps. True. But then again, the scientific community is struggling right now with bad paper reports and headline-chasing. And even if science was the best way to regulate ideas, would that be moral?

Yeah the marketplace of ideas thing is one thing that grinds my gears. I wouldn't say that it is a bad concept in by itself, it was first used as an analogy by a philosopher. But the problem is the American government literally regulate speech, including commercial speech, as if it is a literal economic marketplace. Here's the history of how that came to be: 

> The marketplace of ideas **metaphor** is founded in the philosophy of John Milton in his work Areopagitica in 1644 and also John Stuart Mill in his book On Liberty in 1859.[1] It was later used in opinions by the Supreme Court of the United States. The first reference to the ""free trade in ideas"" within ""the competition of the market"" appears in Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.'s dissent in Abrams v. United States.[2] 

> The phrase ""marketplace of ideas"" first appears in a concurring opinion by Justice William O. Douglas in the Supreme Court decision United States v. Rumely in 1953: ""Like the publishers of newspapers, magazines, or books, this publisher bids for the minds of men in the market place of ideas"".[3] The Supreme Court's 1969 decision in Brandenburg v. Ohio enshrined the marketplace of ideas as the dominant public policy in American free speech law (that is, against which narrow exceptions to freedom of speech must be justified by specific countervailing public policies). While the previous cases dealt with natural persons, the 1976 decision Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council **expanded it to corporations by creating a curtailed corporate commercial speech right, striking down a government regulation of advertising in the process**.[4] It has not been seriously questioned since in United States jurisprudence, but the legacy of those decisions have led to subsequent decisions like **Citizens United v. FEC that curtailed the government's ability to regulate corporate speech[4] and much more expansive advertising campaigns, commercial and political than Americans had experienced previously**.[5]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace_of_ideas

In my opinion, because the American Supreme Court holds the opinion of the marketplace of ideas as being a free market, to understand the problem with the ""free marketplace of ideas"" we have to talk about the problems with ""free markets"". The same weakness that applies to the libertarian or Republican utopia of laissez-faire free markets can also apply to the free marketplace of ideas. As you may have noticed I tend to take a more European stance on regulation, I also tend to hold similar stances of regulation on free markets and also the free marketplace of ideas. EU laws have stricter restrictions on free speech than America. 

I wrote some long-ass comments previously concerning the free markets and free marketplace of ideas in another thread and perhaps you can take a look, please, feel free to critique the points I made in these posts.

> The difficulty of logging into Shadow’s caucus app stemmed in part from the technological tools meant to safeguard the caucuses from foreign interference, Niemira said. Chairs needed to know a **specific precinct ID**, use a **two-factor authentication system** and then enter **a personal identification number**, he said.

All this information I assume are basically conveyed privately to each chair and I assume they are unique. 

The specific precinct ID is basically equivalent to a client key and the personal identification number is basically equivalent to a client secret. 

The hammer I know would be to sign and pass the request body as part of a JWT payload and verify them on the backend. They can add 2FA per submission if they want since it sounds like they're supposed to just submit the end results. That way they can put it up the app store and let anyone download it, it doesn't matter, the backend can verify and only recognize the submissions if the results are submitted with the 2FA passed and the credentials matches.

The question is whether or not this behavior is moral, not rational. 

> People should be allowed to be irrational as long as they do not violate the rights of others (we do so all the time). Regulation of the internet is highly dangerous and arbitrary at this point. Humans, however irrational, have been advancing for millennial.

>  I am very afraid of governmental intervention. We have already agreed on the fact that the people who compiled GDPR were not up to the task. I am more weary of governments than companies. I can simply stop using Twitter, but I can't stop being European or American. Laws are for everyone; Terms of Service are for users. So, when people call for massive regulation and conformation, I wonder who is going to regulate us, and to what end? How will the regulations affect pioneers?

I will go further and argue that it isn't even about if the action is moral or rational, it's about causing harm. We can have all the freedom we want, so long we do not infringe on the freedom of others -- aka right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. The reason why I brought up the irrationality of human beings isn't to point to the irrational actions in and onto by themselves are problematic -- people can do whatever they want to their own bodies, I don't care -- but rather the irrationality of human beings can cause people to take actions that can cause harm to people who are not participating in their irrational gesture.

Releasing state secrets, child pornography, or advertising content aka propaganda, libel/slander/defamation/false light and other kinds of speech that causes harm to children, people, country etc. Anti-vaccination advertisements persuade people to make irrational actions to harm their children and people around them. Facebook recently banned ads selling laxative pills disguised as diet pills on the basis of they are harming young people who take them thinking it will make them thin but end up harming their bodies. Koch Brother's anti-climate change advertisements are causing people to take actions that harm the planet and in turn, everything that lives on the planet. We also don't allow advertising for cocaine or meth for the same reasons. 

The dirty secret about ads is that if you show it it front of people enough times, people will get curious and click. That's the irrationality kicking in. Availability heuristics. 

In fact, America already has a bunch of exceptions to free speech, which includes child pornography, false statements of facts, fighting words, and **commercial speech**. 

> Commercial speech occupies a unique role as a free speech exception. While there is no complete exception, legal advocates recognize it as having ""diminished protection"".[44] For example, **false advertising can be punished and misleading advertising may be prohibited.**[45] Commercial advertising may be restricted in ways that other speech can't if a substantial governmental interest is advanced, and that restriction supports that interest as well as not being overly broad.[46] This doctrine of limited protection for advertisements is due to a balancing inherent in the policy explanations for the rule, namely that other types of speech (for example, political) are much more important.[47]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions

In this essay, the author talks about the Harm Principle and The Offense principle, in which I lean towards using the Harm Principle to determine what should or shouldn't be regulated. 

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/

The argument I am making is to enforce tighter regulation on commercial speech, specifically regulating ad-tech in such we regulate false or misleading advertising on the internet to be up to par to the regulation already placed on cable TV, newspapers or other forms of media. Here are some of the regulations being done by the FDA. 

https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/guidance-industry/advertising-and-promotion-guidances

https://www.fda.gov/drugs/office-prescription-drug-promotion/laws-regulations-guidances-and-enforcement-actions

I mean the government already do all these regulation on print and mass media, and not on the Internet. Do you have reasons to believe that the current regulations on print or TV, when extended to the Internet, will be harmful to the Internet and to the citizens? The rationale behind this call to action is that I believe situations such as anti-vaccination or homoeopathy snake-oil bullshit or dangerous drugs and other kinds of harmful advertising should not be allowed on ad-tech.

> That is the issue; GDPR is not fully enforced. It can't be. Article 17 (aka article 13) cannot be enforced because in practice it requires the usage of bots which will ensure no copyrighted material will be on a website. In other words, every website in the EU is liable for the content on their servers, and thus they have to read every message, every picture, every video, every thing, in order to maintain conformity with article 17 (which was approved by the EU btw).

I understand what you mean, but I am not arguing for the full enforcement of the GDPR neither, just that I am saying that it is heading towards the right direction. 

If we find a bug in the system we build or a feature that our users really don't like, we gather feedback, we iterate, we test and build better versions of the system.

It did the job it was supposed to do, which is help precinct chairs in the field do the math correctly. The problem was caused by a bug in the code that transmits results data into the state party’s data warehouse.” That transmission bug, he said, “had a catastrophic impact.”*

* *Complicating the effort to get people used to the app, reports found that caucus officials were asked to download an app called TestFlight that lets people use software that isn’t available publicly. That additional requirement seemed to add another barrier for volunteers.*

They rolled it out to end-users on [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/)?? TestFlight is basically Apple's app to allow people to install apps that are in beta...

Otherwise I believe I am owed an apology. I'd argue that it's important to have your facts straight when accusing others of not having their facts straight and only say things that you can back up, because otherwise you will just end up spouting nonsense."

I think I'll need some time to digest this and I'll get back to you. I like this discussion because I think you challenge my beliefs with a lot of depth, honesty and points I never thought of, and I really appreciate that. I think we can do this for days lol."
