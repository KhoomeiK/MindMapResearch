birthcontrol,feet9oy,t3_eoshe5,1579040732.0,It’s normal! You can have a different bleeding pattern even though you’ve taken plan B before because it depends on when in your cycle you take it.

Irregular bleeding is unfortunately the main side effect of the minipill. I spotted for many months on it; that is normal. It is not a sign that the minipill is less effective. Hope it resolves soon!"
birthcontrol,fec9ryk,t1_fec10vq,1578969197.0,"You'll want to take a pregnancy test 2-3 weeks after you had unprotected sex. Missing a pill decreases the pill's effectiveness, especially if it occurred during the first active week. 

For future reference, you need to use back up protection if you miss a pill during the first active week, even if you double up the next day. If you miss 2 or more pills during the second and third active weeks, you will also need back up, even if you take them the following days."

birthcontrol,febmwle,t3_eocvb9,1578960567.0,"To answer the first question, yes it would still be releasing hormones, but that’s not primarily how the hormonal IUD works. It is effective because it causes a local inflammatory reaction simply by being a foreign object in the uterus. The hormones itself are not high enough to prevent pregnancy.

I’m very sorry you had to go through that and I hope you continue to recover!"
birthcontrol,fe6geqh,t3_enyt0e,1578890112.0,"Spironolactone is an androgen receptor blocker used to treat hormonal acne.

Closing a card does not have as big of a consequence as people think, especially (as you noted) if the card was recently opened.

birthcontrol,fe5lj45,t1_fe5dpuc,1578870970.0,"I think you're ok too. I would have taken it if I were still taking the pill, mostly because I'm in a financial position to buy plan B ($50 ain't cheap for everyone). Ultimately, I ended up switching to an IUD so I wouldn't have to deal with the pill anymore haha."
acne,fe4imj0,t3_enr9n4,1578859717.0,Thayers alcohol-free witch hazel is an astringent toner that soothes inflamed skin. It also has some anti-acne and oil production qualities.
birthcontrol,fe4hddo,t3_enrsjg,1578859314.0,"It's important to take your combined pill on time during the first week because hormones are still building up to protective levels then. A late pill risks ovulation. For weeks 2 and 3, it's fine to take your pill within a 12 hour window. 

Plan B would be the most risk-averse way to go, but ultimately, it's up to your comfort level. Although you're less than 99% protected on the pill with the late pill, you combined it with the withdrawal method. Overall, the risk of pregnancy is still low."
