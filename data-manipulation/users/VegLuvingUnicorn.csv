socialanxiety,fcpfoa3,t1_fco36gn,1577861916.0,"it’s definitely easier said than done. i love myself more than anyone, which is why i enjoy my own company more than anyone else’s too lol. i think SA can partly be a result of abuse/trauma from a young age that just causes certain neurological pathways to develop and thus negative patterns of thought, etc. i think things like CBT would be really beneficial to help change your way of thinking."
socialanxiety,fcpfkn1,t3_ei81rz,1577861792.0,"i feel the EXACT same way...it sucks! when i’m at work i constantly am looking around and thinking that people are judging me, thinking negative things about me, talking about me behind my back..i mean it’s SO bad that literally when i hear people laughing i genuinely think they’re making fun of me. talk about crazy! part of me wonders if it’s partly paranoia/psychosis/schizo because severe mental illness runs in my family but idk...it’s scary. i’ve been going back and forth on the idea of seeing a therapist who specializes in CBT. SA is such a frustrating thing to live with because you know that it’s all just thoughts you’re making up in your own head...yet you can’t stop it. i want to feel normal so bad. wanted to say you’re not alone and this post makes me feel less alone."
socialanxiety,fcpekkm,t1_fcp5oqd,1577860608.0,this! i feel like it’s more of a positive than a negative for me to be spending this year’s nye alone.
socialanxiety,f8syruz,t3_e21es1,1574792061.0,"i feel this 100%. as soon as i walk out of the front door at work i feel like myself again and i take a huge exhale. it’s draining because i wish i could just be myself around people :( if you find a solution for it, let me know."
