AmItheAsshole,fgficwj,t3_ey20o7,1580739563.0,NTA - the deal was money if you go to college not money for a business venture. I’m a senior in college and taking a entrepreneurial course and wouldn’t put money in these PhD students ventures.
TrueOffMyChest,fg6n6ql,t3_ex4fqz,1580572298.0,Just as George Washington warned. Two parties will breed nothing but contempt for one another while providing no good.

AmItheAsshole,ffu1gih,t3_ev51gq,1580232441.0,NTA You will (hopefully) only be married once and that is an experience that is worth a million trips. My sister recently got married and I wouldn't have missed it if I had to cut my own foot off. They could have easily told the eldest child they're going to have to postpone (doesn't seem like cancelling a trip would be a burden to them).

AmItheAsshole,ffu0ifc,t3_ev4qcm,1580231844.0,"ESH but mostly your sister is the TA. She's an asshole for not being family enough to accept you no matter, but I don't see the need air out the family's dirty laundry on facebook. If you need to vent or talk to someone get a therapist."
AmItheAsshole,ffticqm,t3_ev4r6c,1580221334.0,Overall y’all seem like subpar parents. 3 year olds shouldn’t have phones and you pay someone when you ask them to watch your children. Also 2L day of soda and you’re allowing that???

creepy,ffp53sw,t3_eu6pq9,1580086420.0,She probably needs someone to take care of her.  Its extremely dangerous because armed individuals and cops will not be able to determine if she’s a threat or just has dementia.

AmItheAsshole,ff31wwy,t3_er769r,1579531519.0,NTA people seem to think that having kids of their own warrants special treatment by complete strangers. That’s not how it works. If your kids need a nap go give them a nap.

AmItheAsshole,ff3031x,t3_er3bxy,1579530035.0,"NTA this isn’t a very large change that would change who she is as a person. It’s a small change that would make life easier temperature-wise and financially. My girlfriend and I have a rule that the heat can’t change unless you’re wearing sweatpants, socks and a sweatshirt.
