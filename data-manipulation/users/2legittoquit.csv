There are so many different groups of Native Americans that it is irrelevant to compare people in modern day Central America to those in Modern Day New England.  Some people cleared land for agriculture some people didnt.  Some people were semi nomadic some built Pyramids and had giant cities and ritual sites.  The article is about a New England not the entire North american continent.
