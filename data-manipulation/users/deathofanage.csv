The history of the Pit Bull can be traced back to the early 1800’s in the United Kingdom. Pit Bulls were originally bred from Old English Bulldogs (these dogs are similar in appearance to today’s American Bulldog) who gained their popularity on the British Isles in a cruel blood sport known as “bull baiting”. One to two Bulldogs were set to harass a bull for hours until the animal collapsed from fatigue, injuries or both. These matches were held for the entertainment of the struggling classes; a source of relief from the tedium of hardship."

ABoringDystopia,fdj6pp2,t3_eln4r2,1578459987.0,"Camels are an invasive species in Australia also this is coming from the aboriginal community, ie. 
the people who have lived there since before colonization. They are stealing the water supply to these communities, that is not super available right now anyways because Australia is in a very arid climate already plus all the wildfires. This is necessary. Nature sucks but humans aren't at the top of the food chain for nothing.

If we let these camels just keep doing what they're doing they would eventually die of either starvation or dehydration ANYWAYS. This is the best way to do things unfortunately.

Also humans are kind of in the same position on this planet as these camels, but our compaction for one another requires us to help rather than kill each other. If camels thought the same way we'd have a war on our hands but fortunately it is not this way.

It truly is a boring dystopia"

Humans would have a more limited variety of food without milk that's for sure. And idc it comes from a cow. Ever had unpasteurized milk straight from a cow? Probably not, cause it's illegal to sell in some countries, but it's the best shit ever its milkier milk it's really the best way to drink it tbh, but in America it's hard to come buy unless you know a farmer that owns cows."
