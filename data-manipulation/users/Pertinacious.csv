It *looks* like Walmart is selling a set including two of the XShot Excel Xcess blaster for $7... but that blaster retails for $13 everywhere else. Further, it states 8 darts 10 discs. That's not enough darts, and the older Excel shot discs, not the Xcess.

Between the price, the images, and the description it's clear that mistakes were made. I figure I'll order some and see what I get.

> * To get the key from Silixiz, pickpocket him. If he doesn't have anything to pickpocket, kill him and wait for him to respawn, then do it again.
> 
> * First floor: Mutated Drones. Ambush will instakill them. If you're alone, ambush one, run, then come back and ambush the other.
> 
> * Second floor: Patrollers. Rupture works very well here and takes off an abnormal amount of life.
> 
> * Third floor (outside): Lookouts. Eviscerate (even a one-point eviscerate) will transform them into green slimes that are easier to kill.
> 
> * Fourth floor: Gallywix. Ambush him to lower his life to 50%, then the rest of the fight is as you would expect. If you're level 20, bring a friend -- he hits hard. After he's dead, take his head and lockpick the chest (need skill ~85 I think) and you're done.

classicwow,fg6mvrm,t1_fg6172j,1580572089.0,"1. Brokentooth: Cats in general are ideal pets because they have high damage and can learn both Claw and Bite. Brokentooth in particular has the fastest attack speed of any pet. This means more spell pushback in PvP and more Frenzy uptime if you're BM.

2. Wolf: Wolves are useful for Furious Howl, which buffs the next physical attack of everyone in your party. This is especially a boon in raid situations. Definitely something to consider when sending your pet in will simply get it killed.

3. Carrion Bird/Owl: Carrion birds are generally easier to find, but both of these pets can learn Screech, an ability similar to Demoralizing Shout. Handy for holding threat on multiple targets. Both families are good all-purpose pets with owls having slightly more damage and carrion birds having slightly more defense.

Honorable mentions.

 - Boar: Can learn Charge, which roots the target in place temporarily. This is basically a PvP pick.

 - Wind Serpent: Has Lightning Breath, making them the only pet with a ranged attack, also ignores armor. Handy for leveling, not considered ideal at 60.

 - Bat: Very similar to Owl, but with a very limited diet. Of note, when Zul'Gurub is released (phase 4), it will introduce bats with a 1.0 attack speed, the same as Brokentooth."

classicwow,fg4vfmz,t1_fg4nru8,1580511971.0,"The only practical way you would do this is to make a cast sequence macro. For the totems, it would look like this:

    #showtooltip
    /castsequence reset=15 Searing Totem, Strength of Earth Totem, Grace of Air Totem, Fire Resistance Totem

The reset=# is the number of seconds that will pass before the macro resets itself. So you have 15 seconds to go through the whole list, otherwise it will go back to Searing Totem. You can adjust the duration or remove it should you wish.

Personally, I'd recommend binding important totems to their own keybinds, it's a much more exact way of dropping the totem that you need.

Warlock macro would be similar:

    #showtooltip
    /petattack
    /castsequence reset=10 Immolate, Corruption, Curse of Agony

Get your hands on 50-60 linen cloth and craft bolts. Once you get to 30 skill you can learn brown linen robe. Craft 9 robes then disenchant them, this will bring your enchanting to 10 and let you learn lesser magic wand. Use the materials from the robes to create the wand and you're good to go.

After that I'd recommend dropping one of those professions for Herbalism, it's pretty easy to level as you go, and it's got gold-making potential at 60. Personally I'd drop tailoring, while Robe of the Void is very good, I don't think it's a viable reason to level Tailoring any longer. Enchanting on the other hand you can largely ignore, just use it to disenchant items whenever the materials will sell for more than the item.

At level 60 once you've got some gold drop Enchanting for Engineering, no other profession compares."

What we eventually ended up with is a PvE race where the two sides avoid one-another. I've got bias on why this came to be so I'll leave it at that.

It sounds like you're experiencing AV for the first time literally right after Blizzard made [significant changes](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/alterac-valley-adjustments-incoming/422125).

1. You may not be downranking appropriately, or choosing the correct spell for the situation. This one should be pretty easy to figure out simply by conferring with the other healers. Is this a problem all of you are having? If so....

2. Your guild may not be running enough healers. It's tough to say the right amount, it will vary with gear and with the raid's DPS. At least 10, more realistically 12. If you're in the 11-14 range then...

3. Someone's standing in fire. Pretty simple. I'd bet the raid's healers are covering for a lot of mistakes on the part of the DPS. Are there any particular bosses where you especially feel tapped?

In the meantime to save money you could farm Scholomance for Dark Runes. Either get guild groups going or arrange with PUGs to reserve all the runes, typically I'd offer to pass on all other loot."

Nerf,ffzz2j8,t3_ew2o7p,1580396505.0,"Looking for some blaster suggestions for a relative of mine. He's into the Mega line and has blasters like the Mega Twinshock, the Megalodon, and Thunderbow. He's also 6, so he can't really use any of these blasters effectively.

I'm looking to get him something small, like the Mega Talon or BigShock, as well as more of a mainstay for sustained nerf battles. For that I'm considering the CycloneShock, but I'm wondering if the pull on that is going to be too heavy. A year ago he had trouble with my Disruptor, which is now modified so I can't just have him test it out. A revolver isn't typically considered a 'main' blaster, so I'm fine going outside the Mega line, or outside Nerf into Adventure Force, Buzz Bee, Dart Zone. Springers only though.

The last thing to consider is that he plays a lot with his friends and young cousins. His aim isn't exactly great, so nothing in the Rival space, probably nothing in the actual Elite-performance space either. They're supposed to wear glasses but you know how it is. I could probably step down an Elite blaster if it really was the best option but I'd prefer to just gift it to him in-box.
