Secondly soft tissue injury may occur with cpr and other procedures during a resuscitation such as intubation, or external jugular IV access (starting an IV on the neck) that can result in a hemo or pneumothorax (blood or air in the chest cavity where they shouldn’t be) but these are much more survivable events than sudden cardiac arrest. I mean sudden cardiac arrest pretty much means death. Do not worry about these right now, do GOOD CPR, get the heart pumping NOW.
