wokekids,ffjsy7e,t1_ffjsnjn,1580006092.0,"I appreciate the apology, I got a little up in arms about your response to be fair. For me, my stamina for the argument on whether or not things are real (on this sub) has gotten too low at this point. It didn't help that what they said was totally irrelevant. It would be nice to enjoy the meme for what it is. The arguement is not really that important considering it's not spreading false information about something factual i.e health advice. It's cute and really a low priority issue.

Edit: typos"
wokekids,ffjsiwj,t1_ffjscdy,1580005768.0,"I did too, I think I'm going to remove myself from this sub though because the comment section is more negative than the politics subs- and that takes talent considering the topic is something as wholesome as children."

If the ambulence stops to pick up people who just want a free ride it's taking them away from people who truly need it. I've even met some shady people and I don't think this has ever even occured to them as something they could do. Still though, we can't take an essential service away from people who potentially need it just because a few individuals ruin it."

insanepeoplefacebook,ffjkw61,t1_ffjiiqi,1580000572.0,So much wrong with all of that. It's really unfortunate that some people need to resort to such tactics to afford to get from place to place. Do you guys not have an affordable bus pass for people below the poverty line? It would be really sad if the result of people being too poor for transportation is not to implement a better system but to cut people off from a necessary resource.

I mean i would be grumbly too and so would my boyfriend if we reversed the situation. I could see this happening to me, you guys are a team and it's not irrational to lean on your partner for support when you think there is an emergency. It definitely is concerning that he doesn't take it more seriously, it could've been a real emergency."

trashy,ff4ener,t3_ergsvd,1579561798.0,"Definitly trashy. The fur trade was bad there for awhile because people were killing animals exclusively for their furs. At this point it's gotten enough backlash that it's no longer the case. The only thing that I'd say is okay about it is when it's using more parts of an animal that already died for food. I personally still wouldn't wear furs since  public opinion is soo extremely bad that it would be embarassing to be seen in it, excluding the fact that I don't like how it looks."

hypotheticalsituation,ff49sbk,t1_ff2sx2o,1579558651.0,"I looked it up, i saw something interesting that said Leonardo Da Vinci practiced Polyphasic sleep training. It also said sleep training is not healthy. I wonder if Da Vinci hallucinated because of this, and if so did it effect his art work? Definitely something to look into further and fact check better. I also saw a documentary that claimed that while we sleep Cerbrospinal fluid drains from our brains. They essentially said it was like brain waste and getting enough sleep is important part of the process. The documentary also claimed that people who get better sleep throughout their lives, excluding hereditary genetic factors, are less likely to get Alzheimer's in their old age. Interesting stuff, but if all of this is true I would definitely stick to my 8 hours a night."
hypotheticalsituation,ff47u7e,t3_era9wy,1579557433.0,I have a lot of random skills that i would probably improve on and my sims would have a better house. My chores would get done sooner and i would be happier. I wouldn't be as annoyed about working the late shift. All of this said under the assumption that work wouldn't start opening later because everyone is awake longer and i would start having to work super late. With less needed rest hopefully they don't extend overtime to start later than 8 hours into a day.
Instagramreality,few2fkr,t3_eqly5i,1579404542.0,"So i know I'm going to get downvoted for this, and i agree she's super airbrushed and smoothed out-but the mirror is reflecting from underneath and it checks out. In the left picture the leg in front is the leg in front in the reflection, it's all flipped around in the collage and that's pretty wonky looking. If you're being mirror reflected from underneath you will look stubby. Try it at home, i guarantee it. I think in media we just see a doubled image as reflections a lot, but this looks like she actually stood on a mirror for the photo instead and it's not how we're used to seeing it.

Edit: i would like to add that in the reflection you can see the bottom of her shoes with a bit of toe peaking out, it's a weird perspective but exactly what i expect to see. Her shadow is weird though, I'm pretty sure the horizon lines don't quite match up so they must've moved where she was relative to the background while editing-Unless there's a third light on her and I'm just not imaginative enough to figure out where it would be to cast such a oddly placed shadow. Then again, I'm more of an illustrator than a photographer.."

AmItheAsshole,fdxjyq7,t3_en6jau,1578769509.0,"NTA but I suggest you bring her over to apologise as well to take responsibility for her own actions. Don't lift the grounding until she does and apologizes sincerly. It's always good when the consequences are directly related to the infraction. Drives home a cause and effect and maybe gets through, instead of her stewing in her room thinking you're TA and deciding how to be sneakier about it in the future.
