SmartCar,ffkmfun,t3_eu3ocq,1580025173.0,"I have a 2016 Fortwo. I use the gas app Fill-up and track my mileage. I get between 30- 36 mpg if the Premium gas is actually what is filling my tank that I'm paying for. Just a side note that I normally get 60 miles on the first jig on my gauge. I have found gas stations that are cheating customers by monitoring my usage. Saying that my gas cost per month is 35.00. 

They are great cars and I recommend getting the heated seats as well. I bought mine and my husband's on Carvana.

There is plenty of room and a comfortable ride. Some driver's on highways can be asses but since they are turbo, easy enough to deal with. Also note that these are Mercedes engines and parts and you need the European oil change, so you have to take them to a Authorized Mercedes dealership that works on Smart Cars."

We actually relied on the cat to catch him, as he doesn't know what to do. I heard the sound he makes which sounds like Mommm and sure enough he had him gently in his mouth. I told him to drop him, which he did, and I was able to scoop him up and put him back in his cage, none the worse for wear. I can hear him now running on his wheel. But that cat in the video, he's just toying with the mouse before he would kill it."
