TheHandmaidsTale,fgjrp60,t3_eyw3lf,1580850076.0,"I think it makes me see quite clearly why the Founders wanted religion and government to be apart from one another. I am no longer a practicing Catholic, but not being able to baptize my children would squick me out pretty quick, and the fact that the Commanders are held as the ones who decide God’s judgement on earth pisses me off. The fact that women cannot even speak in court would make me very stabby too."

TheHandmaidsTale,fg4yu8w,t1_ff8aip2,1580514198.0,"When Serena is trying to comfort Naomi when her Commander is on trial, Naomi says ‘we all know what happened *to your first Handmaid*. That says that June is only #2, or else that there was another between that one and June, at least to me...thoughts?"
TheHandmaidsTale,fg4yi5q,t1_fg4xdj2,1580513976.0,"‘Hung’ is used in all cases except when a person is subject to death. When you are speaking of people, we use ‘hanged’."

TheHandmaidsTale,ffog0vv,t1_ffo27bo,1580077289.0,Do you think they would make it a whole family affair? Celebrate God’s victory over a sinners world?
TheHandmaidsTale,ffnf255,t3_eu7vn6,1580065145.0,"I don't know, I think maybe it might be something they DO celebrate, seeing as how births are so important to this society. But they probably ruin it with some dumb religious bullshittery like they did to the baby shower..."
TheHandmaidsTale,ffjukzt,t3_etzejl,1580007364.0,Alma regularly refers to her as ‘Dummy’ and is usually exasperated with her. Janine knows she’s a bit much but has so much kindness and compassion in her heart that such a negative thing doesn’t come from her
