science,ff2xm22,t1_ff29w2d,1579527861.0,Is that why people tend to ignore drinking fountains?
science,ff21may,t1_ff1bt5k,1579491362.0,That's the power of economics in decision making! Most people don't drink enough water as it is and drinking soda instead is a huge contributer to our obesity epidemic.
science,ff15aio,t1_ff0buwd,1579475363.0,"While this is totally true, I do agree that we should use economics to help curb our obesity issues. Why is a bottle of water the same price or more than a soda? The soda contains the same water plus other ingredients. The answer is that soda is a diuretic. Because of this, people get thirsty much quicker and will come back to buy another soda. 

Large corporations capitalize on our biological shortfalls. While this is okay, I really think the better option should be considerably cheaper. It won't stop people from enjoying their soda, but it will slow down the consumption."

thinkpad,fevc1zq,t1_fev3oen,1579395624.0,"Any tips on working on/showing off tech writing skills? I know my stuff when it comes to the tech, I just don't know how to prove that. 

I'm not in the UK. US here."
thinkpad,feur1p6,t1_feugcdb,1579389135.0,"Do you have any tips for getting my foot in the door without going for the degree?

I currently work a ""jack of all trades"" type of job that requires a decent amount of network and server engineering work. I don't really have any formal training in any of it but I make it work. 

In the end, I dream of a job where a requirement is researching new tech. I do that for fun at home!"
thinkpad,feudn5x,t1_feucxsy,1579385578.0,"For which generation of ryzen laptops? 

Also, I want to do your job one day. How do I get there?"
thinkpad,feubtvt,t1_feu68qk,1579385066.0,"Also, if you are talking about the ryzen 2 models, I have an A475. My battery life is pretty good. I wouldn't expect an Intel chip to do much better."
thinkpad,feu86m3,t1_feu68qk,1579384087.0,It's brand new though. In time they will update the firmware and it will get better!
thinkpad,fetym5r,t1_fetwqcj,1579381361.0,Hold out until the new ryzen models come out. They are bad ass.
thinkpad,fetu4k2,t1_fetqc4d,1579380102.0,Haha I'm only at 1 so far. It's an addiction.
gifs,fetc8hh,t1_ferumgf,1579373820.0,"At CES this they showed a living organism built by a computer program. If you time traveler 50 years ahead, I am pretty sure you would think you are on a far away planet in a strange sci-fi special."
thinkpad,fetbe6g,t1_fes1a8d,1579373615.0,I use an old laptop for my home network server. It's a pretty awesome use for old hardware. Saves it from a landfill for sure!
educationalgifs,fetazt2,t1_fermgkn,1579373489.0,Yeah I was really concerned when I thought they were doing that with beef...
therewasanattempt,fetaj84,t1_ferrcd4,1579373349.0,"Everyone just wants their 5 seconds of fame for calling out racism. In a way, it's good. It creates a culture where racism is vilified. I just wish most social media sites would catch fire and disappear..."
gadgets,fet86vx,t1_fes7n7t,1579372653.0,It at least has to be different than the old model so you are forced to buy the new one.
netsec,fesxfyz,t1_fese3gi,1579369915.0,Makes sense. It's pretty built out for pseudo code so it through me.
netsec,ferrdmv,t3_eqdyvu,1579357481.0,Isn't that code missing a return?
gadgets,ferr3h1,t1_feni9pd,1579357386.0,"Not to mention the lightning connector is much weaker and prone to breakage. 

What redeeming factors does the lightning connector have?"
techsupportgore,fernqjk,t1_feqt93c,1579356220.0,Yes and no. For defending against a brute force guesser that long phrase would work well. If I throw a dictionary attack at it I would be in in a few hours.
science,feoyt2g,t1_fenkt4w,1579308340.0,"I do agree that the quantities of many things we Americans eat is alarming. 

That being said, not all food is made equally. Chronic obesity is a huge issue and any help we can get is extremely important."
therewasanattempt,fe02cqo,t1_fdzy0ee,1578801332.0,I think what you said is probably the best way to look at life. Everyone is dealing with something. Too often people judge everyone else as having it easy.
therewasanattempt,fe01zlf,t1_fdzy3q3,1578801079.0,Yep. Some hospitals are now advising their doctors to limit the use of anti bacterial soap. We are already seeing bacteria that has evolved a very high tolerance for antibiotics.
Coffee,fdzxil3,t3_enbn8u,1578798209.0,I have brewed ~20 minutes after roasting before. Flavor was roughly the same. Lots of extra foam. Day to day I brew 12 to 32 hours from roast. Pretty darn good coffee.
nextfuckinglevel,fdzw0m2,t1_fdywbwm,1578797137.0,Maybe it's in kilometers per hour?
explainlikeimfive,fdlmovk,t1_fdkqc4h,1578527502.0,It's both for hunting and to outrun predators. Our fat cells are crazy advanced and awesome for endurance running.
therewasanattempt,fdjotam,t1_fdjb0cg,1578481343.0,"That sounded like a lot of work. I broke down and did it. 

I understand now."

flashlight,fd659e3,t1_fd5b5ch,1578185712.0,So many conversions....
thelongdark,fd647vm,t1_fd56mop,1578185301.0,You could survive in this game for a very long time. At some point you need to move on.
thelongdark,fd63t7u,t1_fd5e1rp,1578185146.0,"I feel like, for some of us, we just need the closure. Without it starting a new playthrough seems like you are abandoning the poor guy or gal."

blackmagicfuckery,fd5o7qa,t1_fd3xqs8,1578179597.0,I am about 80% sure I know where the facility in this gif is. Maybe I have been where you work?
science,fd4g68x,t1_fd4eqc4,1578167202.0,100% yes. I'm working on getting some narcan for my first aid kit but it is so damned expensive.
science,fd4bou2,t1_fd4awo8,1578166158.0,Yeah but reaching that portion of society is a lot harder than fixing the prescription drug issues. We have a ton of work to do either way.
science,fd48cw7,t1_fd2ua9w,1578165322.0,It's sad too. I have seen many a documentary about normal people who fell into heroin addiction after an accident. These are just normal people who had basically no other option.

cableporn,fcp5j7q,t1_fcp5ccw,1577851147.0,"Pretty much man. Like ""better make sure you have an 18.624ohm resistor attached to that ground so you don't lose all of your current."""
cableporn,fcp4r5w,t1_fcmvzhy,1577850430.0,"As others have said, it's a transformer. Transformers are really cool! Current goes through the windings of one side of the transformer. This creates an magnetic current which is felt by the other side. Some fancy math is done and the other side has less windings, or more windings depending on what the desired output is. Through proper engineering, the output can have it's current or voltage stepped up or down."

networkingmemes,fcnw6k9,t1_fcnur2o,1577819656.0,It's pretty heavy on a network to be scanning a /8 with no port specification.

thelongdark,fcav4nh,t1_fcaimkq,1577577219.0,It's not the worst. You can hunt bear from the farmhouse porch. There isn't an easier bear to take.
thelongdark,fcagoln,t1_fc9p5yr,1577568918.0,They would want them to be used right?
Perfectfit,fc8zzxk,t1_fc7p2fw,1577544830.0,I too am a closet gamer. AKA I don't tell many people that I game.

thelongdark,fc8zrzc,t1_fc81x7y,1577544724.0,It's in PV above draft dodgers cabin IIRC.

thelongdark,fc7jleh,t1_fc5edig,1577509489.0,It's a big part of the game The Forest. I wish it could be incorporated in TLD the same way.

thelongdark,fc4giha,t1_fc3kt0a,1577415993.0,We need this. Scrap metal is basically the late game gold. Run out of scrap metal and it's cattail stocks for every meal.
thelongdark,fc4gewk,t1_fc3q5xj,1577415910.0,I really like the idea of being able to build a serious shelter. I'm not sure if it would be in the spirit of the game though.
thelongdark,fc4g8cy,t1_fc3nbuh,1577415757.0,Totally! This would make matches less of a commodity though. I'm not sure how you would balance that.
