FirstTimeHomeBuyer,fet3qka,t3_eqfrdy,1579371534.0,"We recently made an offer site unseen that was accepted in a bidding war (the photos of the home were impressive) and we pulled out after the inspection. Advice from my, non-professional, experience: have your realtor do an exterior walk around and make sure you/they are on the lookout for exterior issues. Most of the pictures you see online will be interior and won’t really alert you to things like drainage problems, roof damage, foundation damage, broken windows etc. And have the realtor look at the details of finish. Is the paint well done? Are the floors in good shape? Are the cabinet doors hung straight? I know this stuff is easily “fixed,” but we were shocked by the actual state of affairs when we did see the property in person. What looked great in photos turned out to be done very poorly.

Edit: Because inspections are expensive (we’ve now done two at $700+, thankfully the second one (the house above) we received a partial refund from the inspection company because half way through they essentially told us the house was not worth it)"

boulder,fdzzxq3,t3_enfppt,1578799762.0,"I joined Wells Fargo as a student! I’m not sure if they still do it, but when I joined I was able to get an account with no annual fees or minimum balance requirements. Their online options are great (I use the app almost daily) and they have branches all over the place so it’s convenient if you move."
houseplants,fdyrb07,t1_fdxwai8,1578782796.0,I was thinking the exact same thing!
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,fdyea6t,t1_fdx7nwp,1578778809.0,"Honestly, for us it was more about feel. We didn’t feel comfortable with the first realtor, she was awkward on our first showing and then very pushy after that. The second realtor (my dads rec) was a great lady, but she just didn’t have the spark we saw in the realtor that we decided to go with."
Watercolor,fdvwfdr,t3_en6wj5,1578752420.0,This is incredible!
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,fdvw02l,t3_en31u3,1578752242.0,"We went through the suggested realtors on Zillow. The first agent wasn’t a good fit. We went back to Zillow and noticed that an agent recommended on a different listing had way more positive reviews, so we reached out to her and saw some houses. We also connected with a realtor recommended by my dad. We decided to move forward with the better fit from Zillow.

Initially I felt guilty not using the original realtor, but this can be a long process and you definitely want to work with someone you click with. We’ve only been in the process for 3 months, and we’ve already seen 20ish properties, written 6 offers (which our amazing realtor has been up late into the night doing for us) and we’ve now been under contract 3 times. (Third times the charm!)"

offmychest,fdf8qnu,t1_fdey36q,1578355931.0,"Now is the time! More so than ever. Climate change is here (these wild fires and the other major events causing tragedy are a testament to that) and it is being demonstrated over and over again that our choice to eat meat in large sums is a driving factor. 

I will be the first person to say that change at the political level is absolutely necessary; our governments and leaders need to step the fuck up. But on a personal level we need to stand up to. I have made a resolution to not only talk about this stuff more, but to buck up in other areas of my life. I car pool to work, I am buying less fast fashion, I bring reusable bags to the grocery store, and there are so many more things that I can do. And I am donating to help fight these fires because hope and prayers aren’t enough."
