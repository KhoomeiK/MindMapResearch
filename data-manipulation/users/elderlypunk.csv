bipolar,ff7uq6g,t3_ervdes,1579658822.0,"I'm curious what the lifespan average is for treated bipolar.  I'm on a ton of meds, and while I'm religious about taking them I wonder about the long term side effects"
bostontrees,ff43yga,t1_ff3v47r,1579555016.0,Yeah from what I hear Gage is one of the best rec dispensaries around.  And the location keeps the lines down.
introvert,ff24yf1,t3_er1s6d,1579493937.0,"No not really.  I'm introverted, this sounds more like social anxiety."

bostontrees,ff1ghy3,t3_eqyfyx,1579478859.0,They told me it was to rebuild their stock.  I just go to compassionate Care in ayer.  Way less busy.  No restrictions afaik
nextfuckinglevel,ff1fle6,t1_fez9fou,1579478454.0,For real.  At that point he was the fastest and strongest pretty much ever.  Just a fucking machine.
StoppedWorking,ff0zdjb,t3_eqzkpr,1579473757.0,I'm thinking tail down would be better than snow on bum hole.

bostontrees,fdyzwhe,t3_emu5ws,1578785316.0,"I went there today with a medical card and it was great.  Decent prices. $60 for a half gram cart.  The parking does suck, but it's Brookline.  What do you expect?  I would suggest if mobility is an issue to get dropped off at the door.  That's what I'll do if I bring my mother."
bostontrees,fdyyyxm,t3_en7sb9,1578784978.0,I just got certified at The Holistic Center in Brighton.  Pretty cool they do appointments on Saturday.

bipolar,fczurd1,t1_fczsg13,1578108957.0,"Nah yr dead on.  This shit blows.  This shit aided me in destroying my educational prospects, career, and most relationships.  I'm a little over 40, and I've been stable for about five years now, but I still feel like I'm absolutely working my ass off just to patch things somewhat together and have a passably functional existence.  Anyone who romanticises this shit is naive at best.  It's a fucking obstacle to be overcome and that's it.  I relate to every word you said."
