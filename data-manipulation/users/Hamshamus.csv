Ireland suffered under British oppression for centuries. Became second-class citizens in their own country.

The anti-English sentiments were borne from this and the fact that Britain arguably caused, and largely allowed, the country to suffer horrendously from the ""famine"", regularly brutalised the people, and even persuaded other Irish to do the same under the RIC. Not to mention the shitshow happening up North.

This is a verrry abridged version of why. We don't ""hate"" the Brits. Sure, there are some outliers that do, from both countries, but that simply isn't true.

However, if You want to look at the conflict as ""they're all racist against each other"", then go on ahead."
