ArtHistory,fei7nut,t1_fehy11h,1579132108.0,"So this piece and a lot of Van Gogh's early work is inspired by Jean-François Millet who was a french realist painter and really the epitome of that movement. Realism was characterized a lot by painting ""the proletariat"" and ""genre scenes"" basically meaning they would paint poor people, typically farmers but sometimes in urban environments as well. Van Gogh never really took up the style of Realists (as you can see by this painting) but was still heavily influenced in his subject matter by them, and when he was just beginning as an artist he did a fair amount of his interpretation of their artworks (you could call them copies but I don't think that's fair). 


This particular painting is Van Gogh's version of ""The Reaper"" by Millet. This isn't one of Millet's more famous paintings so I'm not sure much about the history of that particular piece. 


It appears rudimentary but that's a lot of Van Gogh and the impressionist style. Van Gogh was considered a post-impressionist and though his iconography in this particular painting came from realists, his style still seems heavily influenced by impressionists. Impressionists try to do exactly what the title entails, give you and impression of what you're seeing. The iconography was contemporary life, and the paintings had a sort of hazy quality to them because of the quick, sloppy brush strokes. The goal was to capture the moment. My favorite example of an impressionist painting is Caillebotte's ""Paris Street; Rainy Day"". Van Gogh always painted in a similar way as impressionists though maybe not for the same purpose. You can always see his brush strokes which he often uses to create a sense of movement. So in a sense it is pretty rudimentary, it has sloppy brush strokes and it's not an original idea.


But none of this is to say you can't like it, it's still a great piece of art and I still really enjoy Van Gogh's style and love to see this variation on a very common theme in realism. Also, you can't take art the wrong way. The only way to take it the wrong way is to dismiss it before seeing its merit. Cheers!"

HelloInternet,fei0atp,t3_ep9ma3,1579127509.0,"Obviously the banana incident is quite funny and deserves a bit of a laugh, but art can come from not only the art but the context around it. This has been the case in modern art starting with Duchamp, Magritte, and even Andy Warhol and the pop art movement can abide by this principle. The soup can by itself wasn't art but Warhol was able to make it art by providing adequate context. As an art history buff it makes me a little sad when people just look at the surface level and see a banana duct taped to a wall and don't see the meta commentary behind it"

popheads,fcwezgj,t3_ej4n6y,1578023923.0,Kate Bollinger! Just released her first EP that has a synth-poppy feel. Not as big of a pophead as most but I've been loving her sound and have been actively seeking out more.
vinyl,fcj2tev,t1_fcj1788,1577675865.0,"Interesting question,


I'd imagine that it's intentional because in her previous album, Pianoscope, there were significantly more key changes between songs from what I remember. What I'd interpret it as would be her attempt to symbolize finding stability in an otherwise very tumultuous time in her life. 


I'm looking to catch a concert whenever she comes to the United States, I'll keep this in mind and ask if I get the chance."

vinyl,fciww5k,t3_ehfdw4,1577671760.0,"“To me,” says Stréliski, “Inscape was an existential crisis. A year where everything capsized and I had to go through various interior landscapes – hectic, beautiful and painful at the same time. I found myself in a space filled with grey areas that I didn’t know how to escape. It was a crucial turning point for me. A year of creative evolution during which I reconnected with my deep nature, my essence, my X.”




Inscape is the work of an artist unconcerned with conventions, whose approach of neoclassicism is resolutely current. In her attempt to fill a certain emotional emptiness, she follows a creative urge that commits to taking the listener back to a form of lost sincerity. “A piano, on its own, is a very vulnerable thing, and I want to share this moment with the listener.”




That is Strêliski's description of the album, and it's something I couldn't agree more with. I've always felt something powerful coming from a single piano that I could never quite figure out how to phrase, but I think it is the vulnerability. Listening to a pianist play their work to me feels more intimate than anything. As a holiday present to myself I picked up the clear limited edition LP of INSCAPE and I love everything about it. The animation in the inner label, and the clear pressing just feels right. 




This album has played a big role in my life throughout the last year, seeing me through stressful times, and always being there as an inspiration, I'm glad to finally have it on vinyl. It's the perfect background music to life if you're feeling overwhelmed, or emotional. The sound of a lone piano is so widely applicable, I frequently find INSCAPE and similar albums to be in the background of my everyday life. If you give it a listen and end up liking INSCAPE, her other project, Pianoscope, is less ambitious but is still introspective, and grounding.




Some other projects that I can recommend that give me similar feelings are ""Stories from Far Away on Piano"" by James Heather and ""Solipsism"" by Joep Beving."
