CPTSD,ffh1a9s,t1_ffh00ua,1579920431.0,"you have no idea i dont want to get into how angry i am lol. Ive been worrying for decades about climate change and i actually hold a lot of rage against america for not caring about it sooner. A lot of developed countries have. 

the thing that makes me so angry is that our inaction (im not just saying individuals, also government and corporations) is a crime against young people and future generations. Its a crime against humanity. Like climate change could feasably be the biggest catastrophe that has happened on this planet. And people always talk bullshit about ""oh if i had been german in the time of the nazis i wouldnt have been a nazi"" blah blah. climate change is way more destructive on a human level than the millions that were killed in ww2. I dont buy what people say now.. they would have been marching right along side them. Ive just lost a lot of faith in people over this. 

sorry, got really into my trigger and it's not pretty."
NoStupidQuestions,ffh07dv,t1_ffgxrvb,1579919607.0,"yeah but if you throw in guilt and shame and threat of eternal torture i bet the sexual instability gets ramped up a little. Especially if you were raised in that mindset. And especially because shame around sex can be a form of sexual abuse. Although I see your point. It's difficult to tell, honestly"

wholesomememes,ffggxki,t1_fffe4ii,1579905984.0,I agree. But I think the change needs to be more systemic.... there needs to be increased transparency forced on corporations. Unfortunately a lot of companies that market themselves as earth friendly will appear that way on the surface but be hiding bad practices. Or they will be owned by a large conglomerate that is committing a lot of environmental sins ( most companies in the states are owned by a few huge corporations). We deserve to know which companies are actually environmentally friendly so that we can choose to buy the ones who are good for the environment

RBNLifeSkills,ffekyyp,t3_esqqwa,1579852439.0,"I will tell you what I did that got rid of my bed bugs. Not sure if it will help. I got expensive heat treatment and I moved the hell out of there. I got the treatment the day that i moved so as not to risk being reinfected before i moved. 

I got rid of most stuff except things that were irreplaceable (documents, heirlooms, keepsakes, photos)  or really expensive (my bike and electronics). I could keep all cloth items because i took them to a laundromat during the move and dried everything on 2 cycles. 

I will never live in a multi unit building again... only free standing structures. If you are in a multi unit building... even if you get treatment.. chances are you will get them all over again, unless the entire building is treated. 

be very wary of your mental health because bed bugs can be taxing on your mental health, and its difficult on top of the fact that you already grew up with narcissists."

he would get rages where his eyes would roll back in his head, over small things it always scared me. Even though he never laid a hand on me, i knew from a very young age to stay clear of him that i felt like i didnt know what he would be capable of. even though i never saw evidence of it? its weird its just a deep intuitive feeling you know? 

he always tried to toughen me (female) up making me do  man type chores when i was like 12 year old girl. outdoor survival, using chain saws, roofing and making me feel like i was worthless if i couldnt do it

was always wrestling with me 

he seemed to hate everyone and everything around him
