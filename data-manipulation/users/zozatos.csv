I'd be more likely to class steganography with security through obscurity because generally speaking the 'secret' that hides the information is the same for all steganographic applications of the same technique, so once broken always broken. 

This is different from encryption where I can use the same technique but change the key and the work (cost) has to be repeated to break the encryption again.

I would consider hiding something underground to be more similar to encryption because if you break the 'key' (i.e. search the world for the hidden object) I can just hide the new object the same way and you would have to repeat your search again.

So after 100 years there will be 1/8th the amount of radioactive materials there was initially. Another 100 years and there will be 1/64th.
