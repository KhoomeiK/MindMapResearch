Could it be?' then when she got out of the elevator the guy said to me that that was Rita so I went and got her to sign my shirt and talk for just about 2 minutes. Damian was in the studio at 56 Hope road and I just got to see him working on tracks."

What are you wondering about regarding the family tree? Basically you have Bob's parents who were a white man and a Jamaican woman. And then he and Rita had Ziggy and a few others.  Him and Cindy Breakspeare had Damien. She is half black and so is Bob so damion's 50/50 as well. He was with Cindy breakspeare around the time that he was spending in London. There's no way around it, kind of was not being a great guy when he cheated on Rita... But we all have our flaws I guess. I am happy to field any other questions as I have studied a lot about reggae."

addiction,ff5kugu,t3_eriwxc,1579597736.0,"Addiction is a bitch. I can attest that. The thing is, in your brain there is a war going on a level that makes it so that you'll have very hard time winning without help. I hope you are able to at least get some support.

The war is being waged by your midbrain and your frontal lobe. Your frontal lobe is where your consciousness is. It's where you make your decisions and feel the weight of the options. This part of you wants to stop fucking up your life. 

That part is up against an extremely strong opponent though. It's called your midbrain. It's the controls basic functions and decides what you need based on how much dopamine it provides. Lots of dopamine usually means it's good for survival of your genes, liike eating good food or having sex.  If it elicits a lot of feel good chemicals and takes note of anything that does elicit those chemicals and marks it as good for survival.  Of course you know that it is not. So you battle and usually lose to your primitive inner brain. But now you know and you can be less harsh with yourself. I wish you the best and I hope you have good support. This shit is monumentally hard."

It might keep me a bit mellow and I'm good with that. As long as you don't snort it, shoot it, or sell it, you could actually be preventing yourself from further opiate addiction if they still have a lot of allure to you. Best of luck to you!"
opiates,ff57t6a,t1_ff54dpc,1579582754.0,I don't know. I was taking pretty large doses of tramadol. I was eating about 12 or 14 of the 50mg pills. The withdrawal from tramadol is actually much worse than people think. Because it has the serotonergic element to it it can be just as bad as other opiate withdrawals. I know because I've been through both.
opiates,ff57jmp,t1_ff561nf,1579582521.0,"I was on a vent in a medically-induced coma as well. They had propofol, fentanyl, precedex, midazolam, Ativan and dilaudid in the drip. I had gotten pneumonia and MRSA in my lungs so when I went to the hospital with a tight chest they ended up putting me on the vent for a couple weeks. 

It sucks that your mom told the doctor that. Once those often ignorant doctors hear about addiction they tend to be very stingy with the meds that you need. And I completely understand what you're saying about how you are going to enjoy the meds when you have them. Like you said, sure you eventually have to bee clean but in the meanwhile I can't blame you for wanting to feel that euphoria. It's at least a little bit of enjoyment in a situation that is painful and shity. Best of luck man!"
opiates,ff56qk1,t1_ff54qs5,1579581825.0,"I get it from an addictionologist. I see him once a month and he has been working in addiction medicine for like 30 years. 

Part of me would be happy to stay on buprenorphine until the day I die. I've been hearing about the new implants and shots that can be done for a whole month or something like that. I would be happy to be on that. I don't think it's bad to be on buprenorphine with the pain condition that I have. I guess that's just part of me that wonders what it would be like to be off of it. I'm working with a legit pain clinic right now that is doing like injections in my spine and nerve blocks that perhaps would give me enough pain relief that I could get off the buprenorphine. I am definitely scared as it's been 10 years but if I were to do it I would probably check myself into a detox program that I know of. Thank you for your recommendations. I know those various drugs you mention have been a lot of help to people. I hadn't thought of using kratom to get off of it but that's a good idea. Thanks!"

offmychest,felr92c,t3_epndfj,1579228986.0,"I've spent the last ten years of my life putting out fires. My decade started off strong in a great University pursuing psychology. But then I had several pain related ailments that introduced me to narcotics. I found out that I have the disease of addiction pretty quick. 

 I've been through so many detoxes hospitals and treatment centers. I've been clean for 6 months now though and I am enjoying it.. It's crazy how in life you just focus on the task at hand but when you pull back and look at everything it can be astounding what you have gone through or what you are facing. 

I will just say this about how one's attitude towards struggle can best be utilized: I saw a psychiatrist yesterday and I lamented how terrifying it is that most people have spent their 20s getting their careers and families in order, but I was just trying not to die. The psychiatrist told me that the experiences I've had will be of great use to me as a psychologist. The experiences I've had will allow me to be more compassionate and understanding in this field. I say all of this because you can have very different perspectives on of life's hardships"
AskReddit,felp68g,t1_felmde7,1579227552.0,"I understand where you're coming from. I've gone to so many festivals and people always talk about The Grateful Dead being like the pinnacle of live music. I saw them play as ""The Dead"". I think they dropped the grateful part because Jerry Garcia is dead. It was a mildly good show but nothing special. When you're at a festival and you are surrounded by people enjoying themselves and you're high as a kite of course you are going to think it's pretty good.

addiction,febkrpb,t1_fe98asg,1578959855.0,"That might be the case for other people, but looking at OP's story, it would seem that her struggle is quite different from that. So while I think you might have the right impulse to help someone, you do not unfortunately, seem to have gathered what she needs support on. Remember this isn't a one-size-fits-all type of struggle. Lots of people out there can relate to each other and that's wonderful but also we have to be considerate of the unique qualities of someone else's struggle."

benzodiazepines,feb1ipv,t1_feae5aj,1578954536.0,The FDA maintains that some drugs can potentially become toxic once past expiration dates.

It took me just 3 days to let it run its course. But usually you shouldn't have nearly as much trouble as I had.

So that is it.
opiates,fdms3rg,t1_fdluy0t,1578563024.0,I will add that now that we understand your thought process and now that you have been explained the facts about this is a disease I think we can go back to upvoting your comment. Basically you are having the right impulse but your thinking about yourself in negative fashion is wrong.
opiates,fdmryzn,t1_fdluy0t,1578562840.0,I totally understand what you're saying. But as I now explained in my other comment you have to stop thinking this way because there's a chemical process in your brain overriding the part of your brain where your actual thinking and morality is done. You cannot control that process and that is why it feels like two parts of you are fighting.
opiates,fdmrtgw,t1_fdmjx8z,1578562630.0,I beg you to stop thinking that way. Stop shiting on yourself for having a disease that is caused by a chemical problem in the brain. You did not decide to have your midbrain overpower your frontal lobe by using too much endorphins and dopamine that your frontal lobe can't recognize that it's not good for you in actuality. That chemical process happens without your agreement. The frontal lobe is where all of your actual thinking is done. It's where your morality is so while you're trying so hard to not screw things up your midbrain which controls basic functions like heart rate and survival mechanisms that you have no control over is basically overriding your ability to stop using. I hope that makes sense. Basically the primitive part of your brain is running the show. That's why it feels like two parts of you are fighting and it's not your fault. Maintenance therapy is making life better. it helps control the urges and stops you from using other stuff. So now that you know just stop shiting on yourself from now on.
opiates,fdmrdo1,t1_fdmnbp4,1578562012.0,That's right. Don't take take more than you need or try and shoot it etc and then you are doing what it's for then people can go fuck themselves.

opiates,fdmr4mi,t1_fdm8bsv,1578561662.0,I totally agree. That judgmental stuff about looking down on people stuff for pills versus alcohol is so misguided. Ethanol is just that drug that is taken by drinking it. The actual addictions might look a little different but the help from the fellowship should look the same. It's really judgmental and stupid as hell to look down on people for it. In the brain it's all the same.
theyoungturks,fdm8xbr,t3_em1nhs,1578542739.0,I can't make it any more clear; it's fully acknowledged as a genocide by them. You're unhappy with it taking too long I guess but he grew as a person and bettered himself.
theyoungturks,fdm7phe,t1_fdm7c2y,1578541848.0,Dude he says it's the textbook definition of a genocide and then asks how can I get any clearer than that? So what's your final point here? That it took them too long to acknowledge that? But he did acknowledge it. I think we're done here.

opiates,fdm2agu,t1_fdm1a0q,1578538109.0,"I agree. People telling you that you're not doing recovery right is bullshit. I think some people think that it's all fun if you're taking buprenorphine or something, but that's stupid. Maybe there's a little bit of euphoria at first but it pretty-much wears off. The most I get from taking buprenorphine these days will be a very mild mood lift, it's not like we're out here nodding off and feeling all of that opiate Bliss. People are stupid and I think sometimes they're jealous because they think you're having a really good time taking it. I had a guy at a sober living home in LA who would every time I had to go get my dose from them I would say things like ""have fun"" in a super condescending way. and I also had people just telling me that you're not in recovery unless you get off of that. Those people can take a flying fuck because this has helped me get better. I have a bunch of hardware in my spine and my legs from a car accident so I need something and while I would like to be off of it at some point, this is the best for me at this time.

opiates,fdlvdwq,t1_fdluy0t,1578533390.0,You have to stop thinking like that. Obviously I don't know the ins and outs of your whole story but I'm begging you to not think that you are a failure for using maintenance therapy. It is what you need in this time in your life. It's a way to help you get better. It doesn't mean you're weak or anything like that. This disease is a chemical disorder in our brains that you cannot control. Take care my friend.
theyoungturks,fdlv1s1,t3_em1nhs,1578533164.0,"I appreciate the fact that you stated as a question instead of an accusation. TYT obviously holds two meanings, one is referring to the historic movement of new reformers in the government who were also responsible for the genocide. The other meaning of Young Turk is : an insurgent or a member of an insurgent group especially in a political party : radical broadly : one advocating changes within a usually established group. TYT gets its name from the latter.

More than two decades ago Cenk wrote a piece denying The Armenian genocide. But he acknowledged that it was truly a genocide in following years. I'm not sure how to pinpoint when he acknowledged it but. Both he and Ana Kasparian acknowledge the genocide and are on the same page with the rest of us who know the whole history. I'm glad you asked."

opiates,fdlpt3d,t1_fdlnyxe,1578529606.0,Exactly. Thank you. It's all about the harm that actually is done and trying to lessen that harm. People who create their own purity tests for what recovery is are just being ignorant and sanctimonious I think.

mildlyinteresting,fdjeicd,t1_fdj6527,1578467452.0,I'm glad you liked it. I thought this little bear/dog or whatever it is might want to meet some people.
mildlyinteresting,fdjedrw,t1_fdj7bu2,1578467309.0,Lol maybe that's how he feels I'm not sure. Opinions vary.
mildlyinteresting,fdje965,t1_fdjcawq,1578467165.0,I'm glad you liked it. I actually posted once before and got no traction. Just a few people said I was crazy but for some reason you guys get it! I appreciate it. I look at that dog/wolf/bear everyday when I come home.
mildlyinteresting,fdja63p,t1_fdj7d15,1578462970.0,I think you might be right. There is some resemblance to a wolf maybe as well. I'm not sure which animal spirit is coming through the wall. Jk.
mildlyinteresting,fdj654w,t1_fdj5u49,1578459522.0,I know right? This sub is perfect for little things you might see and usually keep to yourself.
whitepeoplegifs,fd4b71x,t1_fd49p0r,1578166006.0,It refers to BOTH historic phenomenon but to say that there aren't rudeboys into ska or that reggae came first is just factually incorrect. I think we're done here.
whitepeoplegifs,fd49706,t1_fd47lo4,1578165502.0,Yes that's where it was coined. It can refer to either. If you knew anything you would have known that 1st wave ska came before reggae and that many rudeboys are into ska. Look I prefer reggae to any wave ska but these facts arent really up for debate. Literally just Google rudeboy.
whitepeoplegifs,fd46h1w,t1_fd440lc,1578164858.0,No 1st wave ska came before reggae. Also the term rudeboy or rudebwoy came from the Jamaican term for gangster and can be used to refer to both subcultures. Most often in contemporary usage it's used to refer to the 2 tone ska related revival in England. I have played in both ska and reggae bands and studied ethnomusicology including in Jamaica.
whitepeoplegifs,fd42wic,t1_fc42bu0,1578163872.0,Yes they are. The rude boy culture was obviously influenced by Jamaican street culture and it's frequently associated with 2 tone ska revival in England.
AskReddit,fd3tgiy,t3_ejubhh,1578161487.0,"One thing Ive learned about fetishising different places is that moving places isn't a great solution to most of life's problems. Often things that make life hard are our own personal issues, insecurities, dilemmas and habits. Changing the scenery often feels like just what the doctor ordered because its relatively easy and offers new possibilities, but no matter where you go, there you are."
theyoungturks,fd25jws,t1_fd1x9z9,1578142020.0,I can't find anything about them kicking him off the plane. I don't remember anything like that happening either.
confession,fd1t2ze,t3_ejsx2u,1578136380.0," I hate to say this but after spending the last decade of my life trying to fight my own addiction and also studying psych and Neuroscience in college, I can tell you that this disease doesn't usually just go away. It's so insidious that you can't usually recognize that it's beginning to take hold again. Usually we can control things for a while but I've heard probably hundreds of people attest to the fact that it crept back up on them. Then they landed wherever it was that I met them, in a treatment center or sober living situation.

Basically I'm just saying be cautious my friend. I certainly hope that you are one of the rare individuals who goes back to moderated drinking. I just don't like the odds and I hope the best for you."

One has power over others as it's driving principle and is therefore more susceptible to abuse of power, whereas the other's work is based entirely around caring for people in emergencies."
