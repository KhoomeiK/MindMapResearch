AskReddit,ff8gx1z,t3_ery2k3,1579677973.0,"I moved a lot but my grandparents had a bathroom with a cabinet to catch dirty laundry. So it had like a hinged slot and two cabinet doors below to put in a laundry basket. It was their guest bathroom so it was almost never used. 

I remember we were all told to hide because my dad got off work Christmas Eve and drove several hours to my grandparents house. So I ran to hide in my cabinet. Then I realized everyone was hiding the the back of the house so I ran down the hallway just as my dad was opening the front door. We jumped out and yelled merry Christmas. 

In my parent's current house we moved there right as I turned 20 and I was going to the local community college. Outside my bedroom in the hallway is a coat closet with a ladder leading up to a very small room and another door leading to the unfinished attic space. I smoked weed up there."

Documentaries,ff1xzl2,t1_ff0byel,1579488752.0,"Oof I got pregnant after I got married and gave birth when I was 28. I had a decent full time job in sales and my husband made decent money bartending while going to college. I went part time because the two people who agreed to watch my kid backed out or got into drugs so obviously I'm going to choose to keep my child safe, right? Then before putting her in daycare I discovered my kid has autism! Even if I was full time and I still had my old health insurance it wouldn't have covered ABA therapy. Nearly every state covers ABA other than mine because the state refused federal dollars for a Medicaid expansion back in 2015, not that it has a problem taking federal dollars. My state takes more than it gives. It didn't want the Medicaid expansion because it was from Obama. 

Would you like an update? All of the money I had saved since I was 18 that I was going to use to pay off my husband's student loans, that was spent on deductibles and out of pocket costs before his new insurance kicked in. He graduates in May with a degree in economics. But we realized we won't be able to afford to move out of this shithole state with his degree and my degree. So he's already been approved to go back in the fall for a master's in Supply Chain Management. He will have his masters by December 2022. 

So yeah, I'm a bit pissed off that the society I live in can afford to take the president fucking golfing every week but they can't invest in kids like my 2 year old who with therapy can live perfectly normal lives. She will have friends, she will have a job, she can go to college if she wants to, she's worked very hard going to therapy since she was 1.5 years old. I'm very proud of her. And I feel for the families who didn't have a year's worth of rent saved up, who realize their child has a communication disability, and have no chance in helping their child. I feel for those kids and those families because early intervention therapy starting before the age of three can make severe kids moderate, moderate kids high functioning, improve their lives drastically and turn them into independent adults."

That and you are essentially Reddit. I've been on here a little over 10 years and it's this constant thing where people don't slow down, absorb what's being read, think about it critically, and then respond.

It really isn't my problem that you misinterpreted the words I plainly wrote. Especially since I never wrote them for you. You aren't a part of the discussion I was having.
