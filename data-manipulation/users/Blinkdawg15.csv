It's arguably how asymmetric Siege is, though."
truegaming,fdhgwbi,t1_fdfqmj0,1578422391.0,"Siege is a 5v5 competitive shooter, and it's objective based. That's about where the Counter Strike comparisons end.

I'd say it *definitely* has some level of asymmetry. Probably more soft than hard but toeing the line a bit.

Siege has two sides- Attackers, and Defenders. Each side has their own cast of playable characters (called 'operators'), all with their own 'gadget' which is essentially a special ability, and guns. Some characters do share guns, but usually only on their side. So two defenders from the same country might have the same guns, but the attackers from that country have different ones.

Defenders get a variety of abilities to help them, well, defend. They get to reinforce two walls each, which basically makes a wall metal and bulletproof. Then they can use their gadget. There's 21 defenders, all with a unique ability. They also have a secondary gadget- more minor things a lot of characters get. Stuff like a small shield they can place, impact grenades to blow open walls, barbed wire to slow people down. Defenders get 45 seconds (called the 'prep phase') at the start of a round to place their reinforcements, gadgets, and get into position.

Attackers also all have a unique gadget each. They get two drones, which are basically little cameras on wheels, one of which is deployed during the prep phase so they aren't just waiting for 45 seconds. Then their secondary gadgets are stuff like flashbangs, frag grenades, smoke grenades, breach charges to blow open unreinforced walls, and claymores.

Then there's gun differences- Defenders get almost exclusively SMGs, and shotguns. There's literally two assault rifles on defense, and they're not particularly good ones. There's also one LMG. Attackers get assault rifles, DMRs, LMGs, and one character has a bolt action sniper rifle. Every attacker gun can use the ACOG sight, which has more zoom than the rest. Only certain specific defenders can, so generally attackers have an advantage in longer ranged engagements.

The issue is that the engagement range where the AR is better than the DMR is pretty short. People are usually going to see you on motion sensor first.
