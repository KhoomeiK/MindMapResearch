AskReddit,ff8jv3v,t3_es7tg2,1579681901.0,"So. I was probably about 7 years old, and sleeping over at my dad's, a 5 hour drive from my home with mom.  
He always moves around, trying to rent the cheapest place -- or he's running from something.  
Hah.  


I'm was the type to always jump into bed, and sleep with the lights on -- but I shared a bunk bed with my brother.  


My dad was an extremely light sleeper, and literally came to our room to tell us to go to sleep if we tried to read comics after bedtime -- the sound from merely turning pages, from across the hall and through two doors, woke him up from his sleep.  
So I had to just lay there, thinking, in the dark.  


It was a summer night, never got completely dark, and I couldn't sleep, still.  
Something about all the stuff, and porcelain dolls he got stacked in his guest room -- random stuff he inherited from his late grandma that he couldn't part with, but, being a single man, didn't want laying around.  
I heard a strange sound under my bed.  
My blood froze in my veins, and I almost hyperventilated as the sound moved towards the floor.  
Like a thousand small legs, tapping outwards.  
I lay still, looking out of the corner of my eye, waiting.  


...  
A round shape appeared, skin like a plucked chicken.  
I literally died from anxiety.  
Sue Merriam Webster for redefining the word. I don't like it either.  
It stopped moving.  
I remained motionless, barely breathing.  
It remained motionless.  


I switched on the lamp on the table, and couldn't avoid immediately identifying the thing that rolled out from under my bed as an orangey children's size basketball.  
But it was just barely not completely visible. A small part of it was still under the bed.  
I pushed it back under.  


And went back to sleep, with the lights on.  
And the story ends there.  
In a better world.  
I mean. This is the real world we're talking about here -- a real memory.  
Like, seriously -- ""serious replies only""-serious.  


Because I woke up to the sound of the ball rolling out again, and the lights were off.  
And it was darker. The lights were off.  
But it was probably my dad, honestly. Absolutely certainly, because he woke up several times a night, and checked up on us.  
My blood froze again, because at that age, and at that time, I wasn't certain.  
I switched on the light.  
Nothing happened.  
My dad must have pulled the plug while I was asleep.  
He. Did that. A lot.  
I mean, I was like 7 or 8, and afraid of the dark, and not as brave as my dad wanted me to be.  


I rolled the ball back under the bed, harder.  
I heard it roll onto a different material, not hitting anything, stop rolling, and immediately rolled back out.  
I rolled it back more gently, in a slightly different direction, towards the end of the bed.  
The foot end of the bed.  


The ball never even stopped, it just rolled under, and back out, down there, at the end of the bed -- closer to the freaking creepy dolls.  
Massively bad idea.  
I just wanted the ball gone.  
Out of sight.  
So I rolled it back under the bed.  


I swear to god, this is the source of genuine childhood trauma, because the ball shot out, hit the slightly open door that left a tiny strip of light from the hallway into our room, and had enough speed to bounce after impact, bouncing towards the bed, hitting the side of it, before bouncing back towards the door, which was ripped open by my mad as fuck dad, who hit the ball with the door, knocking over one of the dolls, before he angrily grabbed the ball, swore as he carried it out of our room, and drop-kicked it away from his appartment from just outside the door.  


We never spoke of that again.  
The next time we visited him, he had moved again.  


...  


I mean.  
The goblins didn't eat my feet, but goddamn they gave me trauma far into my adulthood."
