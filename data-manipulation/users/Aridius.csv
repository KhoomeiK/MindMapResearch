gaming,ffpcoio,t1_ffm9tvn,1580091741.0,"The tribunal had already started to lose their divine powers after the return of Dagoth Ur, as he kept them out of the heart chamber."
gaming,ffpch7r,t1_ffoty20,1580091600.0,"Edit: My original answer was a definitive yes you made this up as head canon, but that’s not true, as is most things in TES lore. After looking into things and refreshing my memory I’d like to give a more complete answer. 

Nerevar died, and the tribunal used the tools and were cursed by Azura. An entire era passed before Dagoth Ur returned and locked the tribunal out. These facts are not in dispute. 

A central concept in TES is the dragon break. Dragons stand for time, it’s basically multiple timelines collapsing down into one stable timeline. So the past can be self contradictory but also true simultaneously. 

One of the sources we have is from Vivec himself in the book The Battle of Red Mountain and the Rise and Fall of the Tribunal.  Full text is available here: https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Battle_of_Red_Mountain 

The book begins with this: 

The following is a transcript of the words of Lord Vivec, addressed to a Dissident Priest, Malur Omayn, who confronted Vivec with the Ashlander traditions surrounding the Battle of Red Mountain and with prophecies of the Nerevarine, and to unnamed magistrates of the Inquisition who joined Vivec in interrogating the Dissident Priest.

The Ashlander tradition is basically what you said, the tribunal murdered Nerevar. This text is also written long after the return of Dagoth Ur, actually after the player character enters the picture and is rumored to be Nerevar reborn. 

Something else to keep in mind is the mention of the Inquisiton and the priest being called dissident. The ashlander tradition is heresy, and the book ends with this from Vivec: “Act as a dutiful priest should, in accordance with your vows of obedience to the canons and archcanons, and all will be forgiven. Defy me, and you will know what it is to stand against a god.”

The book also begins with: “Who can recall the events of the distant past. [sic]” Immediately these events are brought into question. It’s also interesting that this is a definitive statement or at least lacking in a question mark. Given the game’s attention to detail and focus on the ambiguous nature of the past I don’t think this is a typo. Of course this is speculation on my part; sometimes a typo is just a typo. 

The text follows more or less the story I outlined in my original post, so I’d just like to point out a few interesting pieces to discuss. 

The tribunal is not in the heart chamber with Nerevar and Dagoth Ur when the tools are used on the heart. There is a direct quote from Dagoth Ur during this portion of the text, which at best is told to the tribunal by Nerevar when he seeks their council and is at worst a complete fabrication by Vivec. Quote is: ""That fool Kagrenac has destroyed his own people with these things. We should destroy them, right away, lest they fall into the wrong hands.""

It’s interesting to note that Nerevar also refers to the Tribunal at this point as the tribunal, which is obviously false. No one called them that yet. 

Now this is almost immediately contradicted in the text. Next paragraph: “What Nerevar had said was that the Dwemer had used special tools to turn their people into immortals and that the Heart of Lorkhan held wondrous powers. [Only later did we hear from others present that Dagoth Ur had thought the Dwemer destroyed, not made immortal. And no one knows for sure what really happened there.]”

Vivec then completely glosses over Nerevar’s death. The text continues with the tribunal and Nerevar returning to the heart chamber, Dagoth Ur refusing to give up the tools, and the tribunal gaining the tools and using them sometime later. 

More to your direct point from sermon 29 of the 36 sermons: “He was not born a god. His destiny did not lead him to this crime. He chose this path of his own free will. He stole the godhood and murdered the Hortator. Vivec wrote this.""

Again, were mired in unreliability because Vivec considers his divine self post heart of Lorkhan separate from his mortal self. Vivec claims the tribunal did not kill Nerevar which is true, mortal Vivec did in this case. 

Michael Kirkblade is the writer responsible for this story and he did release an art piece showing Vivec murder Nerevar: https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Foul_Murder

To conclude, I think the real question is whether or not a dragon break occurred around the time of the Battle of the Red Mountain. If so, both are true: mortal Vivec killed Nerevar AND he died from his wounds fighting Dagoth Ur. I’m inclined to believe so but each of us draws their own conclusions."
gaming,ffl8o0j,t1_ffl14i0,1580036373.0,"Before the events of Morrowind three Chimer (ancestors of the Dunmer) Vivec, Sotha Sil, and Almalexia were advisors to Nerevar, basically the king of all Chimer. 

The Chimer learned that the Dwemer (dwarves or deep elves) were planning on using tools they had made to steal divine power from the heart of Lorkhan. Lorkhan was a trickster deity who made the world the game takes place in (the world is actually his body) and his heart exists in world and in game. 

The Chimer went to war to stop the Dwemer but failed. Fortunately when the Dwemer used the tools on the heart of Lorkhan  all Dwemer disappeared from existence (well one didn’t but that’s not really important.)

The tools however remained behind. Nerevar made his advisors swear that none of them would use these tools to steal divine power from the heart. 

Nerevar left another of his people named Voryn Dagoth to guard the tools. Unfortunately he experimented with them and used them, gaining power and becoming insane in the process. Nerevar and his three advisors attacked, driving Dagoth off, but Nerevar died in the attack. 

Some time later Sotha Sil figures out how to use the tools without going insane. He convinces Vivec and Almalexia to do so. They go to the heart and use the tools, drawing divine power but are cursed by the daedric prince Azura (basically the god of the Chimer) for breaking their oath. This turns the gold skinned Chimer into the dark skinned Dunmer (Vivec himself appears half Chimer and half Dunmer, split down the middle.)

The three divided up the three tools amongst themselves and used their divine powers to protect the Dunmer for over an era. Every year they would return to the heart in order to renew their divine powers. The Tribunal or Almsivi became the dominant religion of the Dunmer. 

Roughly 400 years before the start of Morrowind the three gods went to the heart but were stopped. Dagoth wasn’t dead, and was in fact more powerful than those three. The tribunal erected a magic barrier called the ghost fence to seal Dagoth away, but their divine powers dwindle over time and the other two gods lose their tools to Dagoth. 

Vivec locks himself in his city and writes a book called the 36 sermons, maintaining the ghost fence and waiting for the rebirth of Nerevar to come and destroy Dagoth and the heart."

Capital gains taxes make sense. First, the individual already paid taxes on the money before they invested it. Second, they held the investment for a long term, which increases stability in markets. Short term gains are taxed as regular income. If we taxed long term gains the same way as short term gains investors would be hopping in and out of investments quicker, which would lead to wilder swings. This is literally a good thing. 

The top 1% of earners in America pay 37% of all federal income tax collected. They pay more than the bottom 90% of the country combined. They’re already paying more than their fair share.  The top earners in this country aren’t the reason for homelessness. 

I think entitlements do need to be cut. Social security was originally designed to support someone for the last 3-5 years of their life. Now people stay on social security for 20+ years. Food stamps etc should be cut as well. Entitlement spending (social security, Medicare & Medicaid, food stamps) was 60% of federal mandatory spending in 2011. By 2050 these three programs are expected to exceed federal tax revenue. 

How are we not supposed to cut/reform these programs and still function as a country? And no, taxing the rich more wont pay for it, the top 50% already pay 97% of taxes anyway.

OldSchoolCool,fcxvsv5,t1_fcxtghh,1578071258.0,"No, you obviously aren’t getting this. 

Telling someone to shut up on the clock isn’t suppressing their free speech, that’s called having a job. 

Rioting and destroying property on a campus funded by the federal government to stop someone from speaking is suppressing free speech. 

How do you feel about worldnews and politics being shit head liberal circle jerks? And no, neither that nor conservative (or liberal) subreddits banning or deleting comments is infringing on anyone’s free speech. It’s shitty that supposedly neutral subreddits are taken over by dumb, mostly young people who just parrot whatever they can for karma without thinking but that isn’t suppression.

OldSchoolCool,fcw37i8,t1_fcw2qvd,1578016096.0,"No, because one issue is someone being a twat while on the clock. The other issue is people literally shutting down free speech with violence. 

These aren’t equivalent."

Conservatives can’t even do talks on college campuses because left wing students riot. 

I’m not wrong about that at all. 

And I think Kaepernick should be able to spread whatever lies he wants, just on his own time. You know, like everyone else."
