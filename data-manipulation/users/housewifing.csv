SkincareAddiction,ffbfb2g,t3_esisse,1579762796.0,"The skin on my body can be extremely dry,  so I always apply a rich lotion on wet skin after the shower. I'm not loyal to any brand. I change up and have fun. Same with body wash. There are new types coming out all the time, and I try all of them!

I like exfoliating body scrubs occasionally, especially those with lots of oil in them. 

The skin on my body is a lot happier since I've had laser hair removal, and don't need to irritate it by shaving/waxing, etc. anymore. The removal process was hell, but worth it in the end.

It's also a lot happier since I started replacing my loofah every 2 weeks. 

I use sunscreen on exposed parts."

These are my new [weather-proof boots](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/34269647153179670). The sole is made of rubber, though I don't know the exact type. I actually owned an identical pair several years ago, loved it, and wore it until it disintegrated.

My question is, how do I keep the white stripe, white? I wear these boots when it rains, and over here, when it rains, it actually pours, and there are huge puddles on the streets. With the previous pair, the stripe turned grimy pretty quickly under these circumstances. Water, soap, magic eraser, and cleaning wipes didn't help. Any advice?"
femalefashionadvice,feg9kfs,t3_enr5k1,1579083625.0,"All of them, of course. 

In my 40's I feel old enough and qualified enough to break the news that no clothing item is really timeless. Even little black dresses get to look dated, even white buttoned down shirts, even black cigar pants. 

Not that you cannot include a dated item in an outfit. Chosen correctly, it can make you look more interesting. But really, specific items are not timeless. The concept of a LBD may be timeless, or the concept of a denim jacket, but not specific LBDs, not specific denim jackets. 

If I had to tell you which one of my items would look dated the quickest, I'd probably have to bet on my jeans. Denim trends change fast."
SkincareAddiction,fdmoe3j,t3_elshs7,1578557947.0,"Murad's eye creams and serums are magic and quite expensive. I am not sure if they're worth the money, though. I received some samples once, I'm always looking out for sales, and have only once allowed myself to buy them at full price."
SkincareAddiction,fdmmo46,t1_fdmloc9,1578555818.0,"It was a long time ago so I can't give a precise answer, but definitely took Accutane for more than a year.  I had to do extensive testing at some point for liver functions and ocular functions because I was on it for so long.

Interesting advancements, in my case, is for example being able to buy retionid acids OTC that give the exact same results as tretinoin without the harshness.  Or being able to buy a high percentage of Niacinamide instead of looking for it as an ingredient in expensive creams. All the acids. (Salicylic acid has been around forever as a treatment for acne, it should be admitted, so not really an advancement, but I swear, today's formulas are a lot more potent than what they used to sell in the 90's and 00's)."
SkincareAddiction,fdml3pg,t3_em3c8t,1578553987.0,"This was actually heart breaking for me to read. 

I've had acne since I was 14 years old. I am now 43. As a teenager, I didn't have a lot of options. My parents weren't helpful, I had no money, and OTC alternatives didn't really work. When I was 20 years old and started building an adult life for myself, I went to see a dermatologist. She prescribed me all of the things mentioned in this post. The antibiotics, the sulfa, the benzoyl peroxide, the differin, the accutane. Everything except the laser. It didn't exist yet. Lasers were only for hair removal back then. 

That was over 20 years ago. Has really nothing changed in dermatology since then? 

None of those things worked for me. Absolutely zero improvement. After about 2.5-3 years of trying everything the derm suggested, I gave up. I made peace with having to live with acne and scars all my life.

10 years later, at about age 30, I came up with half a solution to my acne by accident. I changed my eating habits and started running, and suddenly my skin improved. About a year ago, I discovered that the skin care industry made interesting advancements and now provides potent formulas OTC, so that was the other half of my solution. I now have clear skin. I have exactly 11 ice pick scars left on my cheeks, but they're fading with every single day. 

YMMV, but Garnier, TO, La Roche Posay and even Olay did a lot more for me than those outdated medical regimens.
