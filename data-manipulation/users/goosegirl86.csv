pokemongo,ff3tmey,t1_ff3pozy,1579548586.0,Me too! Just got this recently and I loved it.
books,ff3tkfl,t3_ercxjc,1579548551.0,Yeah my local Christian bookstore rented them out. I can still see the red plastic vhs covers they would all come in.
IAmA,ff3ti94,t1_ff3sr9e,1579548514.0,"Yeah I knew it wouldn’t be viable but I just couldn’t work out how it would even be possible. You’d have to have an egg without DNA, and then either 2 y spermies, or I guess a Dad with xyy."
IAmA,ff3rmch,t1_ff3q996,1579547356.0,"How would getting a yy even work if females only have x genes, and if xxy are male? I can’t think of my crossover where it’s possible to even create"

Edit: pupper* not puppet"
news,fetamfb,t1_ferrnz8,1579373378.0,TIL that nonce is slang for a Pedo. I was always under the impression it just meant someone was a bit of a posh twat.

I feel so sorry for them."
pokemongo,fet82bo,t1_fesj40m,1579372612.0,"I transfer as I catch if I’m aware of my current Pokémon. But If I’m waiting to catch enough to evolve one, I’ll usually mass transfer because then I can go through each one individually and only keep the top stats. I’ve definitely transferred out my ‘new’ best one by accident on catch and release."

pics,fet4x0j,t1_fesuazn,1579371815.0,"Yeah for me Fahrenheit isn’t intuitive because I grew up in NZ. If someone said to me ‘it’s 86 deg’ I would have no clue how hot that was. But I know that 0 is freezing and 100 is boiling water, so for me that’s far more intuitive. 20 is ok, 30 is nice hot, and 40 is ‘fuck off’ hot. 

It just all depends what you grew up using. I’m living in Canada now, so I’ve  had to adapt. 


I know my height in both, weight in KG although I’m learning it in lbs, super markets annoy me when the regular price is in kg but the advertised special is in lbs (like honestly do they expect me to be a maths genius). Baking I’ve learnt F cos that’s all my oven shows here but I know C better.  Driving speed and Distance, only in Kms, miles I have no idea."

Also super embarrassing."
