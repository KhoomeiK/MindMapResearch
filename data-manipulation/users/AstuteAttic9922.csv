An unconditioned response is sort of like a reflex.
If I were to try and hit you but held back at the last second, the act of you flinching would be an unconditioned response. Or when you lean back on a chair too much and flail around to save yourself from falling would also be an unconditioned response.
Back to the context of your example, if you were to salivate at the sight of food (or candy I suppose) then that too would be an unconditioned response. 
For it to be a conditioned response, you would need an external stimulus. So if I were to chime a bell everytime I gave you candy and you salivate, with enough time the sound of the chime alone (not the candy) would elicit salivation, thus forming a conditioned response."
IWantToLearn,fdd9mb6,t3_ekr9ve,1578301269.0,"No one can teach you how to motivate yourself into doing something. Those that claim they can are just selling you a lie. OP, mastery of a skill isn't something that comes overnight and it takes years of continuous practice to reach a certain level of expertise. If you only focus on how much ""better"" people are than you then you're doing yourself a disservice. The best advice I can give is to only focus on being better than yourself. Take the time to analyze your work to see what you did well and what could have been done better. Step by step, you will see how far you can go but above all else, consistancy and perseverance is key."

explainlikeimfive,fdca356,t3_ekliit,1578270100.0,"The information that's contained on discs is just one long series of hills and valleys created by a laser. When you pop one into you console, the console uses a laser to then interpret that long series of hills and valleys. So if there is a deep enough scratch on the disc, that's now information that will no longer be interpreted anymore. Or a significant smudge can also interfere with how your console interprets that information."
