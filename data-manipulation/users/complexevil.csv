After this event Ouros developed a split personality, while one half was his past self who wanted to help people with his abilities and feared harming the others like he did to his “father” the other was a new part of him who wanted to help only the ones he saw as worthy and didn’t care about harming others to achieve his goals of “improving” the world. After wandering around the world for 3 years Ouros entered Shade academy in Vacuo at the age of 18 so he could become a hunter and help others even more as well as progress in his research of “improving” the people.

**Semblance:**  *Gift and Ungiven -* when touching any sentient being with his left hand Ouros transfers its aura and energy to the target enhancing recovery, abilities and energy for some time depending on the amount of contact, however Ouros will become weaker and his recovery will be slowed down. When touching any sentient being with his right hand Ouros steals its aura and energy making the target slower, less energetic and with slower recover while Ouros abilities will be enhanced. In addition to that Ouros aura naturally restores much slower than normal. Also the semblance is always active and Ouros cannot chose to” turn it off”


**Weapon and fighting style:** Ouros has two short swords named *Cloto* and *Atropos* that can be combined in a two-headed lance called *Laquesis*. In combat Ouros uses his weapons to test his opponents range and attacks so he can create openings to use his semblance, he also use his semblance to heal his allies and provide support."

> If it makes no noise and can't speak how can it relay information?

It can relay info by taking on forms. Examples of this would be taking the appearance of an enemy and/or their weapons, becoming a 3d map of sorts for mission planning, and can even appear as pieces of paper or graffiti with messages on them. 

A more specific example being ""a wall with a graffiti blue skull means to lure the enemy here""

> And besided the mist this just sounds like a weaker version of Emerald's semblance. 

Besides being ""illusion"" based, I am not sure where you got this. If anything I would say this is a variation of Neo's semblance. 

> What sets it apart from that?

Everyone can see them, they have limited durability, and have an AoE after effect that blinds those around it, preventing casual attacks of the mist forms.

>What sets it apart from that? It would be interesting if the mist itself could change depending on dust, such as an electric cloud to keep enemies away, a wave of fire, etc.

Normally I would be in complete agreeance with you, but semblances are supposed to be a reflection of the character instead of just an optimised superpower. Asher (the user of this semblance) seeks the thrill of the tag, and not the ease of the win.

>The sword and sheath is fine but what else will you do with it? RWBY is about over the top weapons. Also I can't be sure but Im pretty sure the only reason people fought with sheaths was because its surprising and the best thing on hand to use as a weapon. I don't see why you would choose a sheath over something like, a mace, parrying dagger, or shield. 

Once again you are correct for most circumstances. Again, the main reason for not using a more optimized weapon is that it doesn't fit the character. He cares more about dragging out the fight until its no longer fun for him, rather than ending it quickly with the ultimate weapon combo.
