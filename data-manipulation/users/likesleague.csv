todayilearned,ffg8nwy,t1_ffg6q23,1579900842.0,"Right, Newton identified a single, isolated and universally applicable explanation (= cause) for a phenomenon that had previously been observed but was not explained. As a result of his definition of this concept of gravity, other scientists were better able to understand various systems in the universe and utilize its explanatory power to better understand more about the universe. That's precisely what it means to identify a cause for observed behavior that explains the behavior. You haven't really made a point."

You equating the two funnily enough demonstrates a small but important misunderstanding of the scientific method.

As for describing our universe, the *why* (= cause) is of the *utmost* importance, because asking *why* leads us to a better understanding. We can say ""observationally, planets move across the sky in some kind of patterns."" But asking *why* leads us to learn about solar systems, orbits, and the general movement of astronomical bodies. *Why* is almost always the first question in the advancement of science, because knowing *why* lets us completely and correctly explain the world (or more precisely, model it with increased accuracy), rather than just citing experience and assuming that things will stay the same. A standalone scientific statement may not require a cause to be described, but a theory is basically describing a causal agent that explains behaviors observed in the world, and scientific progress is more or less synonymous to understanding more about the causal agents of the universe."
todayilearned,fffwg2t,t1_ffff1o0,1579893297.0,"I think proper use of the scientific method includes attempts at isolating the causal relationship between singular factors. And if that's not possible, at least isolating what factors are correlated. This experiment on the other hand doesn't particularly isolate anything. Well-intentioned for sure, but it's kind of like what we would make fun of on a comedy show as a silly attempt at following the scientific method.

Edit: to the myriad people commenting that his approach was commendable for the time, I remind you that Greek mathematicians were, for instance, calculating the circumference of the earth one and a half millennia before the medieval ages even began. Logical reasoning and the scientific method aren't perfectly equatable, but the faculties of the human mind have not drastically changed over the past few thousand years. Society and education are factors, but anyone with a decent head on their shoulders can design a relatively logically sound experiment. Rhazes' experiment was an attempt at doing so within the belief framework and, while creative, was a far shot from being commendable in my opinion. Just because people believed there were humors in the air that affected health, it doesn't follow that you would also believe those humors would be consistently stronger or weaker in certain locations, or wouldn't move over time, or any of several other factors that could reasonably affect such humors other than location. Imagine you're a medieval doctor. If I said ""humors concentrate in areas that humans produce them, so anywhere you build a hospital that houses sick people, rot-inducing humors will concentrate."" That would effectively void Rhazes' entire experiment and isn't any more or less logical than other things believed for the time. Ergo the experiment was not a *particularly* logical one, even for the beliefs of the time."

DnD,ffakq57,t1_ffaglkr,1579738177.0,"I may just be too cynical, but I think its uses are quite limited as even if a healer wielded the weapon, 10 rounds is a lot of time (and spell slots) to do nothing but healing/passing, so it feels like something they just kinda like having until they take a shot at an enemy, then whatever they lose 5ft of speed, no big deal. On someone who intends to attack with the sword (since 2d6 is pretty darn good for a light weapon!) They'd obviously not have it at all.

I don't mean to backseat-design for you here, but what if it were something like ""if you haven't taken a hostile action in the last minute, you can use your bonus action to Disengage or Dodge""? That's somewhat stronger, but also helps a healer stay safe in a way that creates a bigger tradeoff for taking an offensive action, without buffing the weapon for people who use it offensively.

Perhaps we simply have different DMing styles, but I struggle to see a situation where a noncombat +5ft speed boost comes into effect, as outside of combat I rarely if ever precisely track how fast people are moving. Maybe for a healer whose healing spells are not ""hostile,"" but a healer probably wouldn't wield the sword regardless."

I think it's a tad heavy on the bookkeeping -- tracking charges isn't too bad, but remembering when to add a charge past 4 and what constitutes a hostile action is a bit more involved, and the +5 movement if you haven't taken a hostile action in the past ~~hour~~ minute seems like it's not particularly worth tracking or is easy to forget about.

DnD,ffa43k2,t1_ff9o6tq,1579727489.0,While this could be an effect of players who are not invested in their characters (or have boring backstories or dont pursue things related to their backstories) it generally speaks poorly of the DM to not do anything with character backstories.

DnD,ffa3iei,t1_ff9nhgs,1579727155.0,"Ngl I've found the opposite. You probably have an established relationship with your IRL friends such that they know the friendship wont end just because they can't always make sessions or they think things will be fine if they show up late because you guys are bros. Alternatively, they might just agree to play because they like hanging out with you, and don't actually care about dnd.

When you form an IRL group for the purpose of dnd, I find that people tend to understand that dnd is the major commitment that drives the group. Becoming friends as a result of hanging out is an obvious consequence, but if you all came together because of dnd, I think it's less likely that people will sideline dnd.
