Like with Final Fantasy XV there was an prologue anime, it always seems like I'm missing something like that.

Like in kof xiv kyo says ""is this what my dad warned us about"" but perhaps that will be answered later, but the earlier games have many things like this that are never answered, especially in between games.

One of K's endings in the nest saga he sees whip, next game whip is literally on his team with no mention of them meeting up or anything."
