WTF,ff8eegm,t1_ff8dshy,1579674964.0,"Adding on to this, the more you wash your hair, the greasier it will get. Since you’re stripping the natural oils off so often your scalp will overcompensate and produce even more oil. To fix this issue, wash every 2-3 days and use dry shampoo in between so it doesn’t look too greasy as your hair and scalp readjust to a “normal” washing schedule."
UnethicalLifeProTips,ff5lf2a,t1_ff5hlz4,1579598599.0,If your cat is pissing and shitting on your rug regularly then either a. they have a health issue and you need to take them to the vet asap or b. you need to clean their litter box way more often/try different litter that your cat might like better

SuicideWatch,fdefg22,t3_ekr9h1,1578337862.0,"Youâ€™re a good friend for caring. Please keep in mind that while being there for her can help, you are NOT responsible for the actions her illness might make her take. Depression is a chemical imbalance and can convince people that suicide is the only way to go, even if people are actively trying to prevent it. 

As others have said, she really needs professional help. I was able to get antidepressants from my primary care physician when I was in high school, but I was 18. Iâ€™m not sure if she would need her parentsâ€™ permission. Her familyâ€™s actions are erratic but it seems that they might be acting this way out of anxiety and concern, it might be worth speaking with her mother to see if she would allow your friend to start taking antidepressants or even check her into an inpatient facility that will keep her safe until sheâ€™s on the right medication."
AmItheAsshole,fczsl6z,t1_fcyzp59,1578107905.0,"OP didnâ€™t need the vet to do them â€œa favorâ€. Even minor medical procedures have risks. It wasnâ€™t up to the vet to decide what OP wouldâ€™ve wanted. Sure, we know now that they would have said yes to the procedure, but what if that wasnâ€™t that case? The vet should have phoned to confirm, especially because there were extra charges involved. This isnâ€™t the best analogy considering the separation of medical doctors and dentists, but suspend disbelief for a second. Imagine your kid goes in to get their tonsils removed. This is all you gave consent for. A dentist comes in during the surgery and also removes their wisdom teeth. You are only informed of the extra procedure afterwards, after theyâ€™ve slapped an extra charge on to your bill. Not ok."

DiWHY,fc3tor7,t3_eg0zh1,1577398360.0,"Usually crutches are loaned to you from the hospital and you have to return them once you no longer need them. If you bought your own for comfort/cost/whatever reason and donâ€™t need them anymore I donâ€™t see why you wouldnâ€™t repurpose them. Plus, the bookshelf actually looks nice. I donâ€™t really think this fits in this sub."
