It's useless to me without it filling in the space between those drawn cursor positions. I've done console game development before.. so this is a bit analogous to what is done in collision detection physics. To do it right where fast movement is involved, you need to construct volumes spanning the movement between frames (or else the object can't be hit between its update keyframe positions). In this case, it's just the visualization that's important rather than any physics.. but the idea is much the same."

There are several things to understand which make the situation more worrisome than people tend to understand. An understanding of the travel patterns of CNY (and in general - people fly back to China all the time.. I know several people currently visiting who will return soon) along with transmission before symptoms show.. has resulted in the entire Chinese community taking this extremely seriously worldwide. Also - at least where I am - most of the Chinese kids are enrolled in several different extra-cirricular activites. This is a recipe for spreading, and so most Chinese families (in Canada.. despite there only being one identified case) are taking initiative to preemptively cancel it all and are encouraging others to do the same.

When you move the mouse cursor fast, you still see a trail of separate mouse cursors. There are just a lot more of them and it feels less bad. I'm looking forward to 1500Hz (well.. at least display engineers have a long career ahead of them).

More seriously, I think that we're already at a point where response it pretty good.. and so it probably makes sense at this point for Windows to have an option to have a tiny bit of motion blur for the mouse cursor increasing with fast motion to remedy that situation - even if it sacrifices a frame or two of responsiveness (not a huge deal on the Desktop). Importantly, it would have to interpolate between the positions where the cursor is currently drawn, and draw stuff there (anything less would be pointless). Consider that movies are 24Hz, and then you know how much motion blur can help (any decent movie allows for some blur - and when things don't, you know something is off)."

buildapc,fffiqei,t1_fffcqqh,1579884832.0,"With the mouse cursor movement example (which lacks motion blur), I'm certain I would still see the separate cursors at 500Hz. I'd just see about 50 of those cursors spread across each swipe (still with gaps between them) instead of 14. It's a nitpick, but it informs the importance of optimal techniques to use under certain circumstances.. and that's relevant to me because I sometimes do graphics work."
buildapc,fffbqxj,t1_fffad9k,1579880462.0,"Oh yeah - 144Hz is miles better than 60Hz. I don't intend for anyone to think I'm saying that's not the case. I was just greatly surprised how much further there is to go. You're right too.. I don't expect 240Hz to be perfect either.. nor even 500Hz. That's an interesting thing to me.

Going way back, Grand Theft Auto 3 on PS2 was the first case where I really noticed motion blur and realized it actually made things a lot better than they'd have otherwise been. More recently, Ni No Kuni 2 (ridiculously beautiful game - at least the animated anime characters in HDR at 144Hz are absolute madness.. never seen anything like it, since the even the best anime is normally 12Hz (yes, 12) or 24Hz) has it, and I find it subtle at 144Hz. Spinning around isn't perfect, but it's good and the amount of motion blur is adjustable in options.

It's actually easier to be horrified by lack of motion blur than it is to appreciate it being there. Movies are generally 24Hz. With film, the frame capture technique traditionally resulted in smooth blur anyway.. but now you can sometimes see low quality 3D animation (e.g. sometimes for local markets that are less demanding than the US) that doesn't do necessary blur for continuity, and it is absolutely hideous and headache inducing. Similarly, there are graphical demonstrations for realtime 3D developers which demonstrate the difference with it on and off at frame rates .. and it's night and day (am developer, often focusing on graphics - so I'm supposed to notice.. and it impacts my enjoyment of some things). Motion blur at low frame rates is extremely important.. and a small amount is very beneficial at high frame rates, if they manage to avoid too much latency and not screw it up.

I bought at a few different price points.. including at 370 during the ""funding secured"" spike before it nosedived. I much preferred not to talk about that one until it recently surpassed that mark.. and in the greater scheme, I mostly haven't been investing money at all and I'd have been far, far better off if I had simply put everything in an index fund (as would the great majority of portfolio managers!)"
buildapc,fff5e7t,t1_fff0crk,1579876139.0,"Having recently picked up a 144Hz display, I'm actually really surprised and disappointed by how not-perfect 144Hz is. I'm sure it's set up correctly, since I have a 60Hz display beside it and the 144Hz has far smoother motion on the desktop than the 60Hz.

For some things, doing some calculations makes it obvious why it's not perfect. If you shake the mouse cursor on the desktop back and forth across the screen, you're only going to see the mouse cursor 144 times per second. So if you shake it across the screen 5 times in a second --- both ways, so let's so 10 times across the distance.. then only 14 mouse cursors are drawn as you move across the wide span, and you can see each of those independently with gaps between.

A takeaway from the above is that graphical effect implementations are extremely important. In cases where there's fast movement and high contrast, good motion blur can be a must for good visuals. Until every game (and even the desktop..) is written perfectly, there will be noticeable benefit going all the way up to around 1500Hz in my estimation (and iirc, John Carmack has said similar when working on VR).

If this is met, then Elon's options worth 1% of Tesla stock will meet the terms necessary for them to be vested. This is often reported as $1B.

Where the older devs would otherwise continue using Java, I now tend to suggest they use Kotlin and also move away from a POJO-for-everything mindset and more towards a data-driven way of doing things which tends to be more similar to the way looser weak-typed languages are being used by the younger devs. At the same time, I would greatly prefer that we have more competent Go and Python developers, and have an existing base of code to leverage there - and to use more of that.. but we don't, so that's why we use Node.js and we have to sneakily try to get people to do things in a more-data driven way so we're better-prepared for a few key devs to write a Go core for better performance and quicker iteration."

I'm personally seeing rapid cultural shift in regards to leaving the kids to fend for themselves financially though. It's a lot more common for the kids to continue to live at home for periods of time, and (perhaps not coincidentally) for the parents to help out with a down payment and such. Those who didn't get any help (Hi!) got life delayed a bunch, and have hundreds of thousands of dollars less in equity for the trouble. From what I see in cities, this may be partly driven by immigration -- since doing such things is normal in most cultures, and Western boomers were perhaps something of an anomaly in largely not doing so.

China has been making strategic investments in renewable energy a priority, and been building a lot of major infrastructure that can run on electricity (e.g. their very large high-speed rail system) rather than depending on fossil fuels. Like a lot of people, I've spent my whole life appalled with my own country's lack of strategy towards these things. The free market without objectives isn't working and it's looking like we're currently on a trajectory to all die in a real way (after waiting several more generations - far too close for comfort on an astronomical scale).. so every country has things to learn. Everyone all over needs to take the opportunities to learn that are available, and actually smarten up rather than trying to look clever and righteous for pointing fingers at each other.

P.S. Meanwhile, the US is stoking another war in the Middle East after tearing up an antiproliferation treaty for no good reason. FWIW, people in China are very aware that relative to the usual Western allies, they haven't been doing much of that sort of thing - and instead get access to resources through investments, projects, and such (which too, get heavily criticized). From certain perspectives, there are people around the world who might want Tesla to disassociate from the US. I'm not one of them.. but this is the world we live in, and it certainly ain't so black and white (at least when it comes to judging whole countries of multiple millions of people with a single broad brush). Most people are somewhat used to having to make calls on a case by case basis, but it's put aside more in the winner country since it isn't a necessity."

programming,fcv6frm,t1_fcv5ytx,1577995617.0,"No, slightly older than that - but not by much. I'd typed in BASIC programs from books and magazines since a young kid, and had been programming simple graphics experiments in Turbo Pascal and the Turing programming language (a language that was used in some schools) for a couple years. I soon became a lot better in a hurry once I got my hands on PCGPE (The PC Game Programmer's Encyclopedia) which introduced me to assembly language and a bunch of techniques and best practices.

Doom was hotly anticipated (although Doom and Quake are more famous now, Wolfenstein 3D was already a huge cultural phenomenon amongst geeks prior to that), and there was a leak of Level 2 (or maybe a teaser? I don't remember which it was) which got sent around a significant number of months before release (the Internet hadn't yet taken off, but I had a modem and BBS's helped things spread around). It was cool, but ran really slowly. There was a lot of talk and speculation about it and it was already known that it was going to be revolutionary. I followed discussion of a lot of graphical effects since I was into the demoscene - and that was a normal thing for people in that community to do. I don't know if you're curious, or are accusing me of embellishing the story. In any case, since my GP comment is at 0, I suspect that perhaps at least someone thinks so."
programming,fcurdh7,t1_fcupk1m,1577986945.0,"Yeah, I was following the stories about Doom's development during its development - and it was always clearly incrementally building upon the base of understanding that was required in order to implement Wolfenstein 3D. I have a good understanding of the engines since I created a Wolfenstein 3D raycasting clone, and later did 3D engine development professionally.. and also created some amateur Doom maps (so along with the BSP tree stuff, I have awareness of the sector design which was also a good pragmatic decision that most people would have ended up discovering if they set about creating it). It's fairly impressive that Carmack was able to create these things as quickly as he did. The 3D techniques are mostly really old, and lots of people have rediscovered the same things on their own in later years when attempting to get things running in realtime. I had to as well.

Duke Nukem 3D was somewhat later than Doom, but I played both during highschool. It had some additional capabilities however, that went beyond anything provide by the Doom engine at the time (including ramps, mirrors, some better animations.. just kind of different).

Edit: I'm comparing them at their time, rather than comparing Ken's Labyrinth directly to Wolfenstein 3D, and Duke Nukem 3D directly to Doom. Ken's stuff came a bit later, iirc.. but they ran really fast (Ken's labyrinth seemed blazing fast in comparison to Wolfenstein 3D, and didn't compromise - it even had the feeling of being a little more accurate / less janky.. despite its coder artwork) and had some impressive capabilities beyond what Carmack's engines offered."
programming,fcunqjg,t1_fcudjpi,1577984906.0,The engines in Ken's Labyrinth and Duke Nukem 3D were on a fairly similar level to Carmack's work at the corresponding times (and had their own pros and cons -- with enough pros that there were certain things that were clearly beyond the capabilities of Carmack's games).

mildlyinteresting,fcu1lhf,t1_fctyz0a,1577969509.0,"That's sort of true, and is true in some contexts.. and I think it's appropriate for a card, since the number and unit is generally a count of what is on the card. It is easy to get confused though, since it's not the only thing that could be going on.

On one hand, 0GB is the same as 0MB, is the same as 0 bytes. Unlike any other number, it wipes out the quanitifying prefix and makes it irrelevant.

However.. if I only have 2 bananas and an apple, then I have 0 grapes.. but I don't have 0 bananas (since I have 2). When there is a separate 0 card for each unit/suit and each of them is treated differently in the game, then we begin to infer that there is a reason for why they did that.. and so it begins to look like this situation.. and so it changes the interpretation of the meaning of each of the other cards as well and it's very uncomfortable.. in the same way that Highlander 2 managed to wreak havoc on Highlander despite it being a sequel.

If I take a wide context and quantify all I have as a total of 0, then that's saying a lot -- that I have 0 of anything you can think of. So this is back to considering what is represented on the card itself.. the context where all suits apply simultaneously (and where it also isn't necessary to specify). This is what seems most sensible for a card, so it should either be all suits or none.. and in short, I agree."

What matters though is where we can get to from here.. and that means the politically-achievable next step. My perspective on it is that renewables and nuclear are being played off of each other to the detriment of both, and it seems to me that renewables have an easier political battle at the moment than nuclear.. and so we should take what we can get, since at least renewables are a step towards electrical infrastructure (e.g. renewables+batteries are fine for electrical vehicles, but not for the internal combustion engine.. and more EV's will require more electric power, which can then be served by nuclear once that is seen) which will benefit the movement to nuclear as well. Movement away from fossil fuel dependence and toward electricity dependence is a step in a direction that equalizes viability of electric power generation technologies, and is ultimately positive for nuclear (at least.. if the argument that renewables+batteries isn't good enough is correct. Good news is, I don't even actually need to care about the answer, since the best step today in light of the political climate appears the same to me regardless)."
