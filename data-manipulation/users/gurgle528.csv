Go to the forums at  leoaffairs.com and you can see a lot of the accusations from inside the sheriff's offices towards the sheriff and their leadership. 

Orange County Sheriff's Office (and other agencies on scene) got away with beating a guy. They even had a helicopter recording and when they started beating him they started looking at trees.

With that said, they're definitely preferable to a centralized police force and it's good that they're elected."
