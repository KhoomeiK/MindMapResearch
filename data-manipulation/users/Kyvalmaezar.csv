homeassistant,ffgypyu,t3_etjjsy,1579918494.0,">Has home assistant recently been updated in a big way that makes tutorials and information about a year old and older not apply anymore?  
     
It depends on the tutorial. Somethings still work the same way, some do not. Authentication and the Lovelace UI are the 2 biggest overhauls that I remember recently so they may not work in older tutorials. Most of the other stuff should still work.  
     
>Was it in the past not built into the GUI of Hass and you had to code it but now you can just add cards through the GUI?   
     
Correct. It wasn't nearly as easy to get some of the slick-looking dashboards you see now. Using groups or custom webpage was the only way to not have your dashboard look like sensor & device throw up lol. Those methods still work but there's not much reason to use them. Lovelace makes things much easier and most things can be done without any coding. Some cards still do require some, like vertical stacks, but it's much easier and intuitive than the old way.   
    
>Why is there no more hassberry? hassbian?   
    
It's simply easier to install and use HASSIO. They are, at their core, the same thing. HASSIO just has the addon repository to make installing some commonly installed supplemental things *much, much* easier. When I migrated, I had my new HASSIO instance running with all the supplemental stuff - NodeRed, Lets Encrypt & DuckDNS, Samba share, Influxdb, and Mosquito - all set up in a few hours. It would have taken me a whole weekend to do it the old way.    
   
>Is the only thing supported now HASS.IO?   
    
Nope. I just switched over from an old HA installed in venv that predated HASSIO and it got released at the same time as HASSIO. It didn't have the addon repository though. I only switched over because I borked my upgrade of python so it was just easier to backup my config files and start from scratch.    
    
>I've been trying to mess around with themes and am unsure to point to the themes.yaml file or the themes directory when adding it in the configuration.yaml file.   
   
Depends on where you are storing your themes.yaml. If it's in your main config folder: /config/themes.yaml  
      
    themes: !include themes.yaml  
   
is fine.  
    
If you have it in a separate folder like:  /config/themes/themes.yaml
    
    themes: !include themes/themes.yaml
    
should do it."

>I have been thinking about z-wave, though I'm not entirely sure I want to make that investment. What is a z-wave stick, exactly? How well do the devices/frequencies work in your experience?  
    
Z-Wave sticks are basically like Wifi dongles but for Z-Wave. They let your computer communicate with your Z-wave devices without a Z-Wave enabled hub. [This is the one I currently use.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X0AWA6E/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) I only have a few Z-wave devices right now: my locks. They've been solid so far. I'm planning to add a z-wave valve shut off for my water and some leak sensors in the future.   

>I have a schedule that varies a LOT. I also sleep in two different places in my house, so I've been finding it difficult to do any sort of standard scheduling. I think sensors and detection are going to have to be key for me when determining automation stuff as a result... Some days I will wake up at 7am, others not til 1 or 2pm, or I'll sleep in a different room, or I'll move from one room to another to get more comfortable (insomnia is a bitch). Any suggestions on how to go about tackling this? Ecobee sensors are slow and not really designed for something of this nature, even if they work with the ecobee for general temperature and occupancy things...  
   
There's a few methods.   
The most effective would probably be [load sensors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/856yav/i_made_a_stupidly_accurate_bed_occupancy_sensor/) They're DIY but will give you the most flexibility. Eventually, this is the route that I'm going to take.       
   
You can also use door sensors if you close your door when you sleep. Using that to trigger awake climate settings or sleep climate settings.     
   
There are better motion sensors but I haven't used any yet so I can't make recommendations. I've been hesitating on this because I have pets.  
   
My sleep schedules vary by what shift I'm on. [Here is the flow I use in NodeRed.](https://imgur.com/a/nCGnM3V) In Home Assistant, I have a drop-down menu that I manually set to my current shift. Depending on what that is, it will turn on a certain setup of timed climate settings and turn off unused ones. I'm still working on automating days off. My days off much more flexible so I've been manually setting sleep and awake for now. Not sure how much it will help with your use case but you may be able to draw inspiration from it. [The Hookup has a great into series on NodeRed & HA.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuoSXVqjyfc)     
  
>I like the idea of door and window sensors a lot. Which ones do you use? Are those ESP8266 or is that something else?  
     
[These are the specific ones I use.](https://www.banggood.com/GS-WDS07-Wireless-Door-Magnetic-Strip-433MHz-for-Security-Alarm-Home-System-p-1174915.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN) This is the [tutorial I used to set it up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfSbIFIJPuc) More DIY stuff but the sensors are so cheap and I needed so many that the monetary savings was more than worth it. I think I needed 27 sensors in total so the cost adds up fast. IIRC, the hub that allows the sensors to connect to Home Assistant is ESP8266 based. They've been rock solid for the past 6 months. There are alternatives that use Z-Wave but they're more expensive. Wifi ones exist too but they're not as good on battery life as 433MHz or Zwave.  
   
>What automations do you disable when guests are over, out of curiosity?  
    
Any automation that triggers when I leave the house. Sometimes I go down the street to pick up pizza while my guests stay at my place. The pizza place is far enough away that it would trigger the away automation that turns the lights off.   
    
My timed ecobee comfort setting changes. Sometimes guests stay longer than anticipated so I wouldn't want to turn down the temp while they're still there. This is especially true on my days off since the ecobee schedule is a rough estimation for those days.   
   
My Alexa welcome home message. I'm still experimenting with this one. So far, when I open the back door, the door sensors trigger an automation that makes Alexa play a message from Home Assistant using [this custom component](https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player) (Google Home has this ability natively). Right now she just says: ""Welcome Home."" That can get really annoying when the door is opened and closed several times a day with you're having a cookout.       
   
>Any pointers on ecobee? I've noticed their app and communication can be ... Well, flaky at times. Particularly geofencing and the slow sensor updates.   
    
I set up all the comfort settings that I wanted on the ecobee then use Home Assistant/NodeRed to call them. I don't really use any of ecobee's smart features or scheduling. I use Life360 and my Phone connecting to the wifi to determine if I'm home or away instead of relying on ecobee's geofence. As you saw above, I use HA/NodeRed to automate my basic schedule. Life360 & wifi connection take care of any unscheduled aways like shopping. So far I haven't had any connection issues (that I noticed) between the thermostat and Home Assistant.   
    
I don't even bother using the sensors for occupancy because they're too slow. They work well enough as temperature though.  
      
I disabled the smart home/away feature. It would sometimes override my set schedules. The only time I use the app is when I have to manually set my comfort settings, which isn't very often.     
    
>Also, do you happen to know how to UNpair one from homekit? I paired mine with Home Assistant but had to wipe it and didn't unpair before I did so now the ecobee still thinks it's paired and HA can't find anything unpaired.

>bare metal hypervisor for VMs  
    
Use what you're familiar with. I personally use Proxmox because I was able to find tutorials for that the easiest at the time.

I don't know of many rackmount severs that will fit in that depth. A tower laid on it side might on a rackmount shelf might fit. Or custom PC in a small form factor case. I think r/HomeServer is the sub with a bunch of whitebox builds. Intel NUCs are also a popular choice for small servers where space is at a premium.

I don't use them a ton though.    
   
>remove the key timber or something for security reasons   
    
I'd keep the key. Having a manual backup method to get in your house if the power goes out or the batteries die is a good thing. You won't have to smash a window to get it. As far as batteries go, I have the Schledge Connect Camelot and batteries last 3-5 months depending on the weather. Battery life isn't as of an big issue as most people think. They last about 3 months in the winter due to the cold Midwestern winters. I keep 2 sets of rechargeable batteries for each lock so I can just swap them.    
     
>I'm not really sure what to do about the doorknob locks, but I suppose just a standard, non-lockable one should work?   
    
Unless you're replacing the knob for aesthetic reasons, just don't lock the knob. Lock only the smart deadbolt.        
    
>With regard to the power monitoring system   
    
Right now I only monitor power to specific devices: washer, dryer, and my PC. Automations trigger if they're on or off. That's determined by how much power is flowing though. <5w seemed like a good cutoff. My use case might be different as I don't care too much about logging or efficiency. I just care about things that are on or off. I monitor them using wemo insights.   
     
>I'd like everything I use to be as ecosystem agnostic or friendly as possible       
      
I generally stick to the main big brands or things with local control for this reason. One of the major reasons I run Home Assistant is that it's open source. If the devs in charge of it quit, someone else can pick it up and continue it. You also might want to look into Z-wave devices as they're platform agnostic as long as the platform can receive z-wave signals. I have a z-wave stick for Home Assistant to add this functionality.        
     
>Are there ""required"" smart home/home automation pieces I'm missing here?   
    
My advice is always to focus on tasks you specifically want to automate vs a general check list. For example, many people can just use scheduling on their smart thermostats because they work regular hours and have regular off days. For me, that's not the case. I had to also look into methods that determine if I'm home or away as well as a ton of Boolean logic to determine if I'm working days, nights, or if it's a day off. Everyone's needs will be different.   
     
You've already covered most of the more common ones. The only other thing I can recommend are door/window sensors for exterior windows and doors. I have mine set up to turn off my furnace when any of them are open. I use some generic 433MHz sensors because they're dirt cheap.  
    
>Special software that I may need other than Home Assistant? Things I should avoid due to incompatibility with other products listed?   
   
Node-Red. It helps make automations *so much* easier than coding them in Home Assistant.   
    
Tasmoda. If you're looking at ESP8266 based devices, like Sonoffs, most can be flashed to this open source firmware that makes them more versatile with system compatibility. I flashed a Sonoff RF Bridge for my 433MHz sensors. It's a bit DIY to flash them but it's fairly easy to do.     
    
Tasker. Automation software for Android devices. Right now I only use it to auto-mute and unmute my phone based on location & time and send my Wifi password to guests when they text me a specific phrase.   
   
>Snags or catches that you've run across in your own builds?  
     
I have an Input Boolean switch that I manually activate when I have guests over. It disables some of my automations that might they might find annoying.    
    
Instead of setting my Ecobee to a certain target temperature. I use temperature ranges. It helps keep furnace/AC usage to a minimum without having separate summer and winter settings in my automations or manually changing setting on the Ecobee. I set up ranges for Sleep, Home, Away, Guests, and Morning and call them when needed from Home Assistant & Node-Red. The top of the range is my normal target temp for summer. The bottom of the range is my normal target temp for winter."

3. Electric drain auger. I live on reclaimed wetlands so the soil is mostly fine silt that clogs my perimeter drains regularly. I run this thing at least once a month, some time more often in the spring. The drains should probably be replaced and redone but I don't have that kind of money right now.          
     
4. Wet vac. A ton of silt builds up in my sump pits so they also require regular cleaning. I have to clean them out about once every 3 months, less during the winter. Using a wet vac to just suck out the silt makes this so much easier. Before I got the drain auger, it was great to clean up any seepage that was caused by backed up drains.

For example, a committee created to redraw districts should be made up of all major parties in the area with equal representation. This would hopefully keep one side from overwhelming the other and keep things as fair as possible.    
    
Their drawings should fit a statistical model or multiple models that is developed by a trusted 3rd party or parties, like an outside university or higher government body. Throwing in models developed by each side probably wouldnt be a bad idea. It would give an idea of what each side believes is fair but partisan models shouldn't be the only ones. They should only be intermediate tests. These models should help evaluate how fair the new districts are. Any models that don't fit at least the 3rd party models should no make it past here.  
    
Any accepted models produced from this method should then be voted on by local, county, or state governments and/or the people directly.
