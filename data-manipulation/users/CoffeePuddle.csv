In general it's difficult to recover training fees. If you signed an agreement or it was part of your job offer, especially if it specified the actual cost of training, you're probably liable. Often employers will skip pricing things and accounting for training costs properly (since they figure they're not charging for it) and that can be a weak point - if there's no receipts or record of costs associated it's harder to argue the value, or that you agreed to the value."
