But banks still use carrier pigeons, when you 'wire money' they attache the money to one or more pigeons with a wire and then fly the money to the other bank.  this is why it takes 1-3 days for what most assume is an electronic transaction which should be near instantaneous.  Checks take longer to clear because they use older pigeons."

If you dont get the residency you want then you gotta do the one you get, and reapply the next year... and thats a difficult thing to do, because you might piss of the people in your current residency and get yourself into trouble, people in residency can ruin your career if they take a disliking to you.  I have seen it happen more than once.  And so the safest route is to do two residencies, minimum of 3 years each, or do a GP route like FM and find a place where you can do what you want.  Its rare but I know an older FM doc that is does laproscopic and open cholecystectomys, appys, hernia repairs, he does some of the less technical ORIFs as well as  delivers and does c-sections, and care for icu, hospital, and clinic patients.  He does almost evereything.
