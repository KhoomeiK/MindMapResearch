Customer didn't reply me back, so I had to cancel that order and issue a refund.  
my advice is do not translate it yourself, but ask a customer. also maybe check your local postal service demands for the address labels"

Etsy,ffbn68m,t3_esihck,1579773749.0,"this is kind of normal question, just from a insolent person. as mentioned above the best way is to reply that you aren't going to provide such a discount.  


I sell undergarment accessories and I sometimes get 'not normal' messages with sexual content, like what one would like to do with me (on the preview looks like one's asking about a certain listing, but when you click - 'id cum on you all over in this' YUCK). THESE are direct tickets to ban zone. wtf people, go to pornhub, why bother with Etsy..."
