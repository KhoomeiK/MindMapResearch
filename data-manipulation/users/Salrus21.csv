todayilearned,fdwvjnb,t1_fdvcoa1,1578762753.0,"Just so you know, pretty much everything has at some point been connected to Autism or Cancer. Apart from direct gene disorders from birth, we have yet to find the cause for Autism or many mental disorders so these connections are virtually irrelevant. I would keep them out of any discussions because there is about as much correlation as vaccines causing autism."
science,fdl8adw,t1_fdkdb5g,1578518738.0,"This is the problem with a two party system: you have to choose the policies you think are most important and rank them. I want expanded Medicare but I also disagree with the absolutely appalling spending and socialization that the Democratic Party wants to push. America is too big of a country to have fully socialized medicine: there is a reason “medical tourism” exists and the WORST POSSIBLE result would be people taking a trip half way across the world to get a crown from a qualified doctor, or patients having to wait and die waiting or get worse for care. 

This is why Democratic states that aren’t overly aggressive (unlike California) are currently finding a sweet spot: they aren’t truly following the left, they are meeting in the middle like true politicians. That being said, the American political system is currently foundationally flawed because of the two-party system and we need to find a way to eliminate it and encourage a multi-party system so the country can find the perfect middle ground that marks the sign of a good capitalist system and a well-run Republic. 

TLDR: fully socialized medicine in America would be awful, this is the good middle ground, two party system is destroying the country"

todayilearned,fcoc63o,t1_fcobs46,1577828653.0,Ok then name three people from the past you consider role models or idols. Over at least 100 years ago. They were just as flawed I guarantee it. You know Lincoln thought blacks didn’t deserve the same rights as whites right? The problem was society not the people. People haven’t changed in millennia.
todayilearned,fco9jn9,t1_fco7cn5,1577826841.0,"People need to re-read their history NOT written by bigots who don’t really understand the Civil War and it’s participants. Lee was the General of the Army NOT the leader of the Confederates. He was also a war hero for the UNITED STATES as well as Lincoln’s first choice to lead the Union. Lee couldn’t bring himself to lead an army to slaughter his friends, family and statesman, so he declined. He wrote constantly how he was torn over the issue of slavery and the war. When he surrendered, everyone in the North gave him the utmost respect as a gentleman, a good man, and a United States war hero. Yet we tarnish his name because we have to see the world through a modern lens. If you were born white in the south you would have been racist too (and possibly a slave owner). Don’t condemn the people condemn the culture and those who actively perpetuated it (such as KKK members and politicians). Lee was not any of these. Since then, we have had members of the US government torture minorities with zero backlash or repercussion but it’s ok because America is in power and writes the history book. 

Edit:
Since people are asking for material, calling me uneducated or crazy, or are just curious, I have provided some good reading below. Please feel free to add on in your comments as well. It is a vastly misunderstood and criminally undertaught period of history: civil rights and society before, during and post Civil War.

TLDR: put people in context of their situation. Judge them on how their right-minded peers treated them because that is how you will want to be remembered. Honor all good men, even if they are flawed (apart from possibly Mr. Rogers guy was a Saint)"
