I work in Canada, so our police are for the most part, more progressive minded. On average, we have a bit more training to deal with these matters than our American counterparts.

Also our prosecutors and judges aren't elected, they are career professionals, so there is a lower chance of public opinion interfering with a legitimate process.

The issue of consent is very difficult to determine sometimes. So investigators would believe the victim, prosecution would too, but with no hard evidence outside of a victim statement, it can be very difficult to secure a conviction. In Canada, we convict on ""beyond a reasonable doubt"", which means if defense offers even a shred of a doubt that it was consensual, the defendant could walk. 

I've seen convictions in these cases, and I've seen the judge throw it out. I try, whenever possible to do a complete investigation and provide all the facts to prosecution, who then makes a determination in whether it goes forward or not."

The worst pattern I've seen is someone is legitimately victimized, they report it to us, but because of anger / resentment / whatever, they decide to over exaggerate the crime that was committed against them. And then of course, we collect evidence and find that there was a crime committed but that our victim has lied to us to make it seem worse.

There is also the terrifying issue of false or malicious reports. One concerning trend amongst false reports is that the two will have consensual sex, then afterwards one party will break up or humiliate the other party (bragging) and then the insulted party seeks revenge. We have to make sure we get all the evidence before making an arrest, because a simple accusation could effectively ruin someone's reputation / life.

From personal experience, I can tell you sexual assault investigations are amongst the most challenging. Especially historical cases where there is no forensic evidence.

I'm curious to see the specific cases you've mentioned and why the arrests are as low as you've reported. I wonder how much of it is lack of evidence and how much is a lack of investigation. I have unfortunately seen both of these things. Sometimes the victim will disclose the occurrence to a friend or family member, who then makes the report, then when police arrive, the victim recants or refuses to provide a statement. It's about as difficult an investigation as one could get. Sexual assaults by strangers for comparison are very easy to investigate, but familial sexual assaults have many challenges for both victims and investigators.
