AmItheAsshole,ffdaeik,t1_ffcqgzl,1579816600.0,Am I losing my mind or was this EXACT situation posted on here a couple months ago? Entire story was the same with OP going back to an old hometown and running into her bully in a store. The only difference was that OP pretended not to recognise her bully when she tried to apologise.
politics,ffd9wto,t1_ffcmyg6,1579816306.0,"Seriously, the man behaves like he was dropped on his head regularly and he has the audacity to dismiss brain injuries."
funny,ffd9f2b,t1_ffchnl9,1579816013.0,I didn't realise the body was that of a dog until I saw his face sticking out.
cringe,ffd8odd,t1_ffcrbl1,1579815589.0,Is this guy on medication? He seems like he's on medication... or maybe he should be.
cringe,ffd8juk,t1_ffd4pyg,1579815515.0,"Average citizen?

Is the average citizen batcrap crazy?"
funny,ffd7pgg,t1_ffc6tlj,1579815036.0,Now compare this to that Border Collie that absolutely shreds the course.
freefolk,ffczm4m,t1_ffcmvgl,1579810518.0,"Is THAT what they're working on?? LOL, well dang. How the mighty have fallen."
politics,ffct7ps,t1_ffcrird,1579806772.0,"Exactly. The GOP has been playing chicken with the US public and is basically saying _""Oh, you're going to let us get away with that? ...well, how about this? Oh... you're going to let us get away with that too? ...well, then we're going to do this as well. Hell, while we're at it, we're going to do this, this and this. Not like you're going to do anything about it.""_"
worldnews,ffciwql,t1_ffcdmfm,1579800433.0,And all the farmland from the farmers they bankrupted with his 'trade war'.
worldnews,ffcfobq,t1_ffccwjp,1579798452.0,"Yes, it seems they're on a speed run of ""hold my beer"" decisions."
politics,ffcf1ub,t1_ffc82a8,1579798068.0,"Even if there was, their idiot viewers would say ""Oh look, they added a star to their name. Nice."""
politics,ffcdpn8,t1_ffc78zq,1579797239.0,"Showing the USA who is boss you mean. They are ignoring the will of the people, not just the Dems. And they're doing it so brazenly, they're content with doing it in front of cameras and the entire nation. 

If they're not going to be held accountable, why should they act in a manner that suggests they're concerned?"
politics,ff9ftg1,t1_ff9f7ci,1579712097.0,"And? They're doing it right in front of you. With cameras. They're perfectly happy with the audience, not like they're ashamed about it."
politics,ff7ag23,t1_ff7a020,1579644607.0,"Well, you're in luck! We're on the path to do just that."
politics,ff79zbg,t1_ff6si3c,1579644227.0,"Honestly, I still can't believe that the whole of the USA is just watching their country shatter on TV. This administration doesn't give a damn what any American has to say whether Republican or not. Flood the Senate phone lines and they'll turn off the phones. And still, they'll watch on TV."
politics,ff6ynmv,t1_ff6tz33,1579637592.0,"Agreed. It's the ones that don't fit into the 'traditional' DC crowd that DC needs more of. The AOC's, Bernies, Tilab's, etc."
politics,ff6x2td,t1_ff6wfjk,1579636665.0,"As a none American, this is a strange way for justice to be doled out by the very people that are causing the issues."
politics,ff6wz60,t1_ff6wf7g,1579636604.0,"Well, I mean he's gotta change his underoos he probably soiled."

AmItheAsshole,ff6bime,t1_ff667c6,1579623572.0,"That's not petty, that's diligence. I would have put a fence up the moment they got huffy about it as I'd just anticipate them being assholes and the kid 'accidentally' getting hurt in it. It is unbelievable how entitled people can be with other peoples property."
politics,ff45hku,t1_ff42zq5,1579555977.0,"LOL, I'm Canadian too. And I agree, I was surprised but more in a horrified ""Did they really just do that? Wow, I guess they did"" kind of way. And as the years of him in office progressed, it became more of a ""Yeah, I'm not as surprised anymore...""

Also, I didn't take your comment as an attack at all friend!"
politics,ff42fz7,t1_ff408t8,1579554082.0,I don't disagree at all. What a lot of Americans are unwilling to accept and realise is that the rest of the world wasn't as surprised as they were when they elected Donald Trump.

politics,ff3f6of,t1_ff2x3mh,1579539822.0,"This was the guy the GOP said was their best option for President of the United States. All the people in their party, their nation and they said this was the guy that represents them all the best. 

This guy."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ff2chpa,t1_ff26jvz,1579500673.0,"Yeah. The one that won't be Queen. 

This is why I don't get why this is a big deal. Like 6 people have to croak for Harry to ever be King. So who cares where they live and if they want to be involved? They just want to live, let them."

unpopularopinion,ff2b56y,t1_ff0sw0k,1579499326.0,I'm just happy to see an unpopular opinion for once.
WatchPeopleDieInside,ff2azyz,t1_ff1rueo,1579499188.0,Mom. I don't like it. Send it back. Now.
