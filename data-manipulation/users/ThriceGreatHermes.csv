The original series made an entire season by taking the Aezali arc and extending it out for that season, with other arcs from the light-novels spliced in to pad the time.

Judging by the six volume Orphen manga, which presumably is closer to the light novel. We only need four,maybe six, eight tops, episodes for the arc play out.

I think that the Aezali arc was the most popular at the time, so they made it the center of the show, instead of letting it being the opening then just getting on to other things.

The impression I get from the manga, is that the Orphen series is very episodic. 

It's about Orphen and company's adventures as they travel around the continent, at least for what I saw in the manga there is no one bad guy to defeat, object to get or destroy, or place to be.

A single goal may have been introduced in the later volumes, the series ran from 1994 to 2003.

[Spoiler source](/s "" At the manga's end with Aezali, female once more, returns."").

So perhaps that story arc lasted a couple of volumes.

The original series made an entire season by taking the Aezali arc and extending it out for that season, with other arcs from the light-novels spliced in to pad the time.

Judging by the six volume Orphen manga, which presumably is closer to the light novel. We only need four,maybe six, eight tops, episodes for the arc play out.

I think that the Aezali arc was the most popular at the time, so they made it the center of the show, instead of letting it being the opening then just getting on to other things.

The impression I get from the manga, is that the Orphen series is very episodic. 

It's about Orphen and company's adventures as they travel around the continent, at least for what I saw in the manga there is no one bad guy to defeat, object to get or destroy, or place to be.

A single goal may have been introduced in the later volumes, the series ran from 1994 to 2003.

[Spoiler source](/s "" At the manga's end with Aezali, female once more, returns."").

So perhaps that story arc lasted a couple of volumes.

anime,feka8jt,t1_fejkudr,1579195840.0,"> Again, 1. I don't think there are that many hardcores to justify a new project, 2. if all they want is the old show, they can watch the old show, and 3. I seriously doubt that there would even be that many fans of the old ones that would be upset with a new visual style for it. I think you're advocating for a very tiny fraction of a fraction of a fraction of this show's likely audience.


The author started writing new light novels a few years ago, the returning old fans combined with the new generated enough buzz to justify this anime series.

I'm willing to bet that the art style was retained.  

The [Original Orphan series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT0DKWaQW80) took the Aezali arc and extended that out to the entire season, when it could have been resolved in 4 episodes at the least and six tops; I'd guess that the Aezali arc is one of if not the most popular.


I doubt your very old or a Star Trek/Star Wars fan.

Trust me aesthetics do help sell series. 

It not looking right would loses people.

> As has Gundam, and yet they're constantly making completely new Gundams. Just because the franchise started a long time ago doesn't mean that they can't update it for new generations as well, while retaining enough of the original spirit to keep on board all but the most OCD fans of the original.

Most of the Gundams are either spinoffs which are each their own setting or sequels of the Universal Century that are years to decades removed from each other.

You have licence to advance things in sci-fi, what looked high tech forty years looks barely functional today.

Orphen isn't a sci-fi setting and the story that we see isn't one many years removed from the original.


> That's what I said, ""it looks dated.""

Orphen's style was a bit dated even when the original came out, he's dressed like an 80s metal band member.

Which is how the character should remain.

Orphan stood out even then because he didn't look like the typical shounen protagonist or fantasy wizard!

> This is my point. The show could benefit from a better aesthetic.


No your point is that you do not want Orphan, but something like it.


> Because it's really good. 

But I've already seen Bleach.

 
> . I mean, I'm not super hyped about Orphen this season

I feel that in some ways  it's a step down from the original.

> Like I said, I doubt that will cut it.

They should have just remade the original with better tech.

* Spell circles, softer character designs, and a lighter overall atmosphere. 

Modernity isn't always good.

> I think the series will likely be a pretty forgettable nostalgia bomb that nobody will be talking about by the end of the year

I do as well but because the old show is better, not because of catering to nostalgia.


>  rather than a rebuilt classic like Dororo was.

In Orphen's case that would be mutilation.

When the last two seasons  of Slayers were made, they just made the old show with better tech.

Which is what they should have done here.

Orphen  light-novels were originally published from 1994  to 2003, there is so much material.

Yet the doom of this series will be clinging to the Aezali arc, instead of getting that out of the way and on to the later ones.

We're slate for thirteen, if we're not done with Aezali by episode six this series will be dead...at least to me."
anime,fek6ghu,t1_fejo44r,1579193602.0,"> Because that's the entire point of a premise

No it is not!

The opening of a story doesn't give away what the rest of it is supposed to be about.

>  I'm not asking for intricate details about the past, I just wanna know who these characters are and why I should care.

You were told that from the start.

You care because the events matter to the protagonists.


> I didn't feel like the first episode did anything to show me that.

It did.



> Except we had a whole flashback section of the tower where we were shown multiple people and their names, yet we learned absolutely nothing about them. Neither did we learn anything about how these people relate to each other.

No exception.

We know that are all school friends.


> Every episode should have a pay off, even the episodes that are setting things up.

You got what you needed to get to the next episode.

You got what was needed to get you to the next episode.

> I'm not asking for the story, I'm asking for the premise that is supposed to make me care enough to actually watch this show.

You have that!

Why should the entire premise be given away at the start?

What happened to stories being able to explain things in do time?


> We didn't really get any information about the characters; they were showing them all off without any indication of who they were or what their personalities were.

The characters personalities are pretty clear from the start.

Orphen takes himself quite seriously,but is a bit of a dodgy person, and he is immensely loyal.

The Dwarves are trouble makers.

Cleo is bright eyed and inquisitive, and is kinda pesty.


Aezali is a self assured risk taker.


> The first episode obviously had enough potential to bring me back for episode 2, which did have a much better payoff.


Why would there be pay off while things are being set up?

anime,fejk1y1,t1_fehlr80,1579177472.0,"> If the new visuals were good then I think it would retain most of the older fans, and would stand out on the quality of the new visuals.


People come to a revival/reboot to get the same experience that they got before, but through better means.

To not give them that is to loses people.


 > Perhaps so, but I think it did pretty well, didn't it? I'd rather that new shows be considered classics of the modern era, than ""a passable homage to the original series.""


That's point Orphen isn't a new franchise, it's been around for almost twenty five years!


> Accepting your theory that it ""stands out,"" I don't think it does so for any laudable reasons. I mean if it just ""stands out"" by looking dated, that's hardly anything worth cheering about.

It doesn't look  dated, it looks like the source material.


> It's good for a series to ""stand out"" by looking better than the shows around it,


Do not underestimate the value of aesthetic.

I have already seen Bleach, so why would I watch that show?
