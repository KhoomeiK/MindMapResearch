I've seen files with different dates, and initially thought Wordfence hadn't detected an earlier attack, but I rather believe it's the virus changing the dates after corrupting the files, as Wordfence warned simultaneously for multiple changed files.

Wordfence doesn't do anything automatically tbhough. It doesn't name the virus either, so it seems like it can't detect what virus it is, just that files have been changed.

I did the following last time I encountered a similar attack on a customer's site:

* Removed all accounts except for those people I personally knew (it was under development, so that was fine)
* Removed admin rights except for me and another key person that I know
* Changed passwords to very long ones for all
* Installed Wordfence and configured high sensitivity and other settings that should make it trigger-happy, including of course the firewall
* Removed all plugins that I didn't know of / hadn't used myself earlier

Last time I manually removed all infections based on feedback from a Wordfence scan. That included both changes to existing scripts as well as completely new files.

Wordpress,ffetbyf,t3_et5giq,1579864564.0,"PHP can run completely independent batch jobs as well, similar to Perl etc. I use that to perform operations that must not time out (which is otherwise the case with Apache-launched scripts). In one case such a batch job runs forever (a queue handler) and if it ever crashes it's automatically restarted via systemd. So, at least in theory, viruses should also be able to make use of such scripts.

Now, I don't think the virus you mention does so, as there's a simpler way. Instead, when an infected script runs due to being accessed via HTTP (by a bot or browser) and in turn Apache, it re-infects index.php.

Maybe you found virus blobs at the beginning of seemingly randomly chosen scripts, as well as new scripts with names like ""wtreuyqw.php"". I am helping a customer with a site that gets re-occurring such virus ""blooms"" and each time I manually remove all infected files, in part helped by Wordfence telling which files are infected, but I still edit manually in most cases. I suspect either a plugin or the theme being an attack vector, and there's certainly suspicious traffic, from countries that should have no interest in the site's content.

I've also encountered the same thing: files I just cleaned get infected again, but eventually I get rid of everything.
