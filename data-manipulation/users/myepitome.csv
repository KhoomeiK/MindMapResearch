I've had a runny nose for 7 years. I do use a prescription spray called Ipatropium Bromide (Rinatec) that helps it to dry up a bit, it's not perfect but it's not more manageable"

Dentistry,ffhq9bx,t3_etk2kr,1579948149.0,"I'm biased because I'm obsessed with teeth and I'm not even a dentist Haha. (Maybe potential career?) ..but a persons smile is the first thing I notice. And although I wouldn't care if someone else's teeth are crooked etc as long as they look healthy and taken care off, but I find it awful on myself. They may not take away attractive points from someone but a good smile with great teeth can certainly add to it for me."

antidepressants,fen0pet,t1_femt3h2,1579274357.0,"Oh wow. Why do you think you gained weight with them? Did your appetite increase and you ate more? This is my scariest thought about anti depressants because I know if I put on weight I'm just going to obsess over it. I'm sorry to hear you had all this, how long were you on them?"
antidepressants,felf0a0,t3_epqrfm,1579220623.0,"Thing with this, is especially in the UK (I don't know if it's different where you are) is we can't choose what type we are given."

SkincareAddictionUK,fed6v7u,t1_fec70oa,1579001698.0,I haven't! Are they natural in lush? olive oil sounds like a good overnight thing to try!

Dentistry,fdr2rpe,t1_fdqj8ny,1578678763.0,Okay fair enough! In my head because of the gaps left I'm just worried it makes it less permanent. If the composite veneers break/fall of etc and I don't have the money right away to replace them am I going to be left with unsightly gaps rather than if it was all straight and then they're added on.
Dentistry,fdor6wl,t1_fdoldi8,1578611065.0,"Ofcourse, I understand that. I was mainly saying that the reason I've visited multiple is to get different quotes/advice on what can be done. I've been told by my general (non cosmetic) dentist to look around before making any decisions. I've found one I like, I'm just wondering if leaving gaps after invisalign is necessary as the other dentists I've visited haven't mentioned this whilst giving me the same treatment plan."
Dentistry,fdog8mi,t1_fdnz3s1,1578604522.0,Ahh was that with traditional braces?! And what's what your recovery like?!
Dentistry,fdo8gov,t1_fdo4im6,1578600703.0,"Im searching for the place that makes me feel more comfortable/better price as it's such a big investment and just want to make sure I'm certain of the place I'm going too. 

In terms of the veneers, that makes sense, just with the length and price of invisalign i was hoping for them to be completely straight after and then the touch ups, so as if they were to fall off or something in the future I wouldn't be left with gaps until they could be replaced. I dont know much about composite veneers really, I'm just a natural worrier Haha"
Dentistry,fdnurr8,t1_fdnsrx1,1578593256.0,"Hi there! Thanks for taking the time to reply. 

He did mention that I would benefit from botox injections to lower my lip too, but as it's not really a permanent solution I'm apprehensive to do this. 

As the gum contouring would hopefully make me happier with my smile anyway. 

I'm not being referred, it's in part of my treatment plan after veneers and invisalign, and it's a cosmetic dentist that will do it all for me."
depression,fcl51v2,t1_fckot1b,1577739968.0,"That's awesome! I can't bare a 40 hour workweek, tried a few times now and it severely impacts my depression, I feel like I lack time to do what I want/need, and get so exhausted that I wouldn't bother doing anything at all when home or on my days off apart from recharging. 

It really makes a difference when your coworkers and managers are nice! Nothing worse than a toxic workplace!"
depression,fcl4q5y,t1_fckjj0y,1577739768.0,"Wow awesome! that's a long time! longest for me is 2 years or so and then I feel like I always go off the rails, start getting bored/unmotivated."
depression,fcl4j2x,t1_fcksd7k,1577739645.0,"Sorry to hear that, I'm crossing my fingers that your luck will change soon. The first job is always the hardest because no one wants to employ someone without experience, but how can you get experience without given a chance to get it? This world confuses me haha"
depression,fcl4ban,t1_fckxwiw,1577739508.0,"I'd glad you're doing well in your career and are able to continue your hobbies etc. :) 

I can relate completely, that's the part we all forget to do, in a world where we are overworked we forget to take care of ourselves. 

Yes I have been on a waiting list for therapy for about 9 months, one month to go, and then i should be seeing a regular therapist, will be nice to unload finally, and start working on myself. Meds haven't worked for me so far but I'm going to try a new one next time I see my doctor and see how that goes."
depression,fcl3usx,t1_fcl2hek,1577739223.0,"Hi there! I am currently on month 9 of the waiting list for therapy which i will supposedly get after 10 months, it's been a long wait! ...I have tried meds, only one type recently but they gave me side effects, I will try another soon, I was just waiting for the peak time at my work to die down so i have less to worry about if they affect me negatively."
