Supplements,ff48o1k,t3_erf1m2,1579557952.0,"I use Swanson Vitamins a lot and Life Extensions which can be expensive for some things but not all things (not the things I normally buy).  I only use Amazon for name brands I already know and trust.  Not to long ago, I did buy this random new eye formula cause it was like way too good to be true, had everything I was looking for in one pill for a whopping $5.99 so I tried it and it was awesome, went to reorder, was $19.99...gotta watch out for that as well!!"
legaladvice,fezakja,t3_eqrx28,1579455379.0,"Most states consider everything a married couple has as ""joint property"". Get the bank records as they were b4 u went to rehab (your bank can give you these), take them to a lawyer, explain what happened. Get some kind of proof as to what kind of car you had & estimated value as well. Everything she took while you were in rehab is still half yours. File for divorce (or separation whatever you want to do here) and there will be an ""asset"" portion to be detailed by both of you.  It goes back several months usually 6 so don't delay, get started ASAP.  And technically, usually not even allowed to change locks without some kind of move out order (called diff things in diff states but a lot of states require).  So sorry for these hard times, stay strong! Not a lawyer but have been thru similar, less than 5 yrs ago."
science,fez6ebv,t3_eqtnrk,1579454265.0,yeah cuz ppl always go back to the abortion clinic for follow-ups and questionnaires...esp those who were traumatized by it (eye rolls).  and they're def honest about they're most personal feelings (more eye rolls).
fatlogic,fetwtp1,t3_eqgo9g,1579380853.0,"Well doesn't say how tall she is or how much she weighs, what her bf percentage is, etc. so it's hard to know if she's on point or not.  Not the comparison to what's avg or not but if she is a muscular size 16 she'd prob have a high bmi as well so she'd be right on that issue. It happens.  Also bmi is bad judge for asians because they have thinner bones so naturally weigh less, gives them an incorrect lower bmi. I think how fat someone is should be judged by how much fat they carry.  If they carry a healthy amount for their age/gender/size, good...if not, need to do something about it."
PEDs,fenl3x4,t3_eq2adk,1579287001.0,"For endurance, I would add 20mg of SR9009, fkn rocks (only last a couple hours tho so time it accordingly)."
fatlogic,fenjgmc,t3_eq0je2,1579286003.0,"The waist seems too big...mine is 34 "" (32 if I suck it in :) and I'm fat/not muscular @ 170lbs, 5'3"""
fatlogic,fdehmzz,t1_fde6llp,1578339217.0,"I was really sick once, I had some unknown illness caused internal bleeding and significant weight loss.   I went from 135 to 95lbs in 6wks (always been pudgy, never skinny in my life, am short 5'3"") and I got so many praises, all my girl friends were jealous :( and so much guy attention...even my dr hit on me which I felt was gross and inappropriate since I was basically fkn dying under his care :(  Kept losing despite eating like a pig and supplementing with multiple Ensure shakes a day...it was all I could do to maintain 85lbs in the end.   The only person who had the appropriate response was my bf at the time, having seen me up close and personal so to speak, he was very concerned about what was happening to me."
introvert,f9382ls,t1_eshw5cg,1575052261.0,"You only get that impression  bcuz you don't get the joke, you don't get the meme, you don't get introversion.  And lazy, anti-social, crippled with anxiety...can't you see how rude your judgement is?  Can't imagine why folks would opt to spend time by themselves rather than listen to people like you who would judge so harshly something they clearly don't understand?  If it's not for you it's not for you but its not hurting you so why waste your energy judging us?  We watch netflix at home bcuz we enjoy being alone and watching shows...how is that any better or worse than an extrovert who would go with a group of friends to a movie theater or a club or out to eat in a public restaurant, whatever.  Personal time is fkn personal time, if you ain't hurting anyone with it, it's no one's business to judge.   And we don't literally hate ppl (for the most part) and those of us who actually get these meme's know that...we hate the expectation a lot of ppl have for us to socialize and interact with them."
