nyctransit,ffdaouu,t1_ffdae42,1579816779.0,"Thank you! Though there will be no follow up, I was curious at to what is the proper route of action to take in this situation."
nyctransit,ffd8kti,t1_ffd3lv3,1579815531.0,Just because they feel like it?
nyctransit,ffd2noy,t1_ffcsyus,1579812215.0,"Yeah, but the turnstile was a considerable distance away from where the cops were standing."
Advice,fd7oatq,t1_fd7n869,1578207544.0,Do you see her in person often ?
Advice,fd7mvmo,t3_ek9fwe,1578206925.0,"You not alone man. I struggle with that too. Maybe start accepting the fact that you like this girl. Nothing to be ashamed of. Let the attraction you feel translate into your interactions with her. Show your interest without being overbearing. If she’s into you, she’ll definitely show it. If not, then at least it didn’t go any farther. Other than that, try getting your mind off things by playing a sport, hanging out with friends, or just doing nothing relaxing. It’s ok to do nothing sometimes !"
Advice,fd7ks5v,t3_ek8nbm,1578206032.0,"Good on you for wanting to help out. It sounds like they’re experimenting which is normal. However, if they are spiraling down the path of addiction, you being there to support them is the best way to help. 
In my experience, loneliness always led me to relapsing.
I wish you and your friend well"
Advice,fd6c2ks,t1_fd5j0t7,1578188685.0,Yea that definitely helps. I think I just need help getting closer to my friends in general. I don’t have problems when it comes to meeting people.
selfimprovement,fd6bp2k,t3_ejwdlc,1578188523.0,Love this post! I needed it.
Advice,fd5gkkm,t1_fd5gem9,1578177388.0,"Yea, I do jiu jitsu but it’s not in the neighborhood. I practice with adults, though."
Advice,fd5ggta,t1_fd5fj2e,1578177351.0,Nah I can leave the house anytime and public transportation is good
getdisciplined,fcisr3h,t3_ehdx8i,1577668926.0,This is great. Thank you!
Advice,fcfxbox,t1_fcduzb5,1577634601.0,Yea that definitely helps. I took up jiu jitsu and weight lift and run on my off days. It really helps me in feeling secure in my own body.
Advice,fcfw75d,t1_fcfth55,1577634293.0,I just tried this and it helped me. Thank you !
Advice,fccwfw8,t1_fcc6oq2,1577603469.0,"That sounds like a really good method. Do you find that your head is clear of those thoughts afterwards, or must you couple it with another activity to get your mind off it?"
Advice,fccw127,t1_fcbzzz7,1577603323.0,I’ll try this out. I’ve found writing my thoughts to be helpful in dealing with past experiences but haven’t tried it with regards to present thoughts.
Advice,fccvrzr,t1_fcbzgww,1577603237.0,Thanks for the response. I’ve tried meditation but with recurring thoughts I’ve found it very hard to resist the urge to just punch something to release the tension.
getdisciplined,fcb044z,t1_fcay4gs,1577580028.0,"Nothing specific but here are a few ideas I thought of just now. Maybe, include a general ranking system that spans across every habit, depending on how long you’ve maintained the habit. Example: beginner => advanced => etc. Rank gets affected by how consistent you are. Also, a currency system of some kind that allows you to buy different themes and whatnot for the app. Once you reach a certain number of days, you earn however many coins that can be saved up. I like the sound of this app; I’m excited to see how it turns out!"
getdisciplined,fcajjpi,t3_egryxe,1577570407.0,"I’d say support. The reason I believe this is that if you do happen to fall behind, support may be able to help you back to your feet. However, if a person is not competitive by nature, the achievements of others may work to demotivate that person rather than push them closer to their goals. Though, incorporating competitive aspects may work well with the support part of the app."
confessions,fc9xkw6,t1_fc9wdc1,1577559704.0,"Haha, I know what you mean. Too bad him and I cut contact as our interests were radically different after high school started. I’m all for embarrassing stories and laughter, so maybe one day. It feels good to finally get that out, thank you!"
confessions,fc9vwem,t1_fc9trrw,1577558978.0,"I appreciate the response. Yeah, it’s not as dramatic now as it was when I was younger. I was raised in a shame culture, so that explains the yelling. For a little while after, I couldn’t believe I did that. I started having self-conscious thoughts and thought there was something wrong with me. This is me untangling the webs."
confessions,fc9t4rv,t1_fc9pnt5,1577557826.0,"17, i just remembered it happened not too long ago."
story,eio0gyp,t1_eio033g,1552750425.0,yea I’m gonna go for it. thanks !
