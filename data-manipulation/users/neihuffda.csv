    F = m * a = (-m1 + m2) * 9.81m/s^2

m1 is equal to the mass of the craft, while m2 is essentially its lifting capacity. Imagine strapping your craft to a scale, and then zero'ing out the scale. On full throttle, you'd see the indicator showing a negative number, and this would approximately show you how much it can lift. That's m2 (ignore that it's negative. That's just due to how the scale works). Notice that in the equation, m1 is negative - that's because the mass of the craft is working downwards, while the thrust pushes the craft upwards.

*OR*, you could give the thrust as a mass only. That is, you only measure how many kilograms it lifts. One way of doing it, is strapping your quad to something really heavy, like a 20L water container. Put this ""assembly"" on a scale you could use to measure your own weight, and note the weight. Now throttle up, and note the reduced weight. The difference is sort of the thrust."
