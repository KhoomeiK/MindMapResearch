AskReddit,ffarw4a,t1_ffa148y,1579743051.0,"Disease isn’t a hypothetical threat, but I get what you’re saying. Even though climate change is a real threat, the fallout won’t be as devastating as a truly random and unpredictable event would be, which is why I rank them above climate change as a threat to humanity."
AskReddit,ffar3xk,t1_ffajygu,1579742527.0,"Dude I’m not trying to one up you here. I get that you’re saying not having a cure for a bacteria today isn’t different from not having a cure for bacteria before modern medicine. I still support that antibiotic resistant bacteria are more dangerous today than they were a few hundred years ago before antibiotics because of the /rate/ they can affect a population (which is why I used the Ebola example). The danger really lies in how bacteria will mutate.

Today, if an antibiotic resistant bacteria mutated to something more like meningitis, we would say it is more dangerous than if a non antibiotic resistant bacteria mutated to something more like meningitis. It’s fatality rate partially depends on the time it takes the medical community to responded to it. That distinction (antibiotic resistant vs not) would absolutely determine the survivability of a disease.

Whether this is more or equally dangerous to a few hundred years ago is a moot point when we have the technology to combat it. Especially considering we could currently deal with diseases like the Black Plague. I also don’t think it would necessarily wipe out a species (I’d put my money on a virus for that), but I do think they pose a greater threat to humanity."
AskReddit,ffaf9nn,t1_ff9yipi,1579734361.0,"You may want to read more about the spread of pathogens like the Black Plague in the late 1300s and compare it to the Ebola scare of the 21st century. People are more connected today than they were 700 years ago. Human to human infections could reach 6 continents within 24 hours (in the case of the coronavirus from Wuhan that’s been identified recently, this may have actually happened). Any significant population decrease can put a species back hundreds of years, so it’s a pretty bad scenario to begin with.

Further, an antibiotic-resistant bacteria is usually a persistent strain bacteria that has developed an immunity to antibiotics. So what makes them more dangerous is that they can travel further and more effectively the less they’re able to be treated."
AskReddit,ffa0a9h,t1_ff9u148,1579725283.0,"I agree it’s a threat, but what makes asteroids, supervolcanos, and disease an even greater threat isn’t the scale of change but the rate of change. We have a general timeline for climate change, during which we can mitigate its effects and/or prepare to adapt.

The other catastrophic scenarios would take place anywhere over a few days to a few months and and have the potential devastate humanity to extinction because they’re things we wouldn’t have time to react to."
AskReddit,ff9l0lt,t1_ff9cfnx,1579715228.0,"Because it’s not a contender for a species-ender scenario for us, though the threats that could wipe out humanity (primarily, disease) are exacerbated by it. In short, while climate change can, has, and will lower the biodiversity of the planet, humans are extremely resilient and adaptive.

However, it’s actually not cheaper to die. To put someone’s ashes in a plot can cost $10,000. To dig a hole. For ashes. Actually cremating someone can cost $1,000-3,000.

The real issue is actually the escalation on your part, as the best options for a positive outcome  for you are deescalation and negotiation. 

I noticed you said you use Tumblr to stim, and while I acknowledge that may be the case (I used to be the same with the same few YouTube videos), there’s also the consideration that Tumblr is a social media platform that is intentionally addictive (the notes/sharing system, unlimited scrolling, and I believe there used to be perks for more active users, although I don’t know if that system is still around). So this begs the question: is Tumblr still just a stimming activity for you, or has it crossed into a dependency/addiction? Is it a healthy stim or is it negatively impacting other areas of your life?

This is coming from someone who ran a very active and mildly notable blog on Tumblr for about 3 years. In the end I concluded that the platform wasn’t healthy for me and terminated my account."

Quite a few resettle and relocate, some return, but most of the population influx comes from foreigners who come to live in the country. There are a lot of migrants now from the Syrian war too, but the south in particular has always been a migrant hotspot as it’s along frequented sea routes from North Africa.

Today there are plenty of towns with an almost exclusively 55+ population, in my experience at least. The bigger cities like Milan have a younger population (as do many university towns), but not a sustainable number.

My personal policy is never to get offended. About anything. Because there are only ever two scenarios which can lead to someone feeling offended. 

1.) The person doing the offending is doing so intentionally, and the goal is to get a response out of you.

I have the Bose noise cancelling headphones for other reasons, but I can confirm the over-ear ones are some of the best noise cancelling headphones out there. They don’t block out all noise 100%, but it can be pretty dang close. Like if someone is standing in front of you and talking to you, it sounds like they’re behind very thick glass, or underwater. It can block out most jet engine noise on flights, so I’d imagine with your door closed and in your room, it’d be fairly effective.

natureismetal,fdxlxsb,t1_fdwh3os,1578770412.0,"Lizards and non-mammalian animals have a slightly different genome. Komodo dragons have ZW chromosomes (as opposed to XY in mammals, like ourselves). To develop past early development in an egg, the fetus needs a ZZ or ZW. In this case, ZZ leads to male offspring, while ZW leads to female offspring. When a female Komodo dragon (ZW) reproduces asexually, the eggs are only given one chromosome. The ones given Z duplicate to be come ZZ, male offspring, and the ones given W fail to develop. 

This ensures a breeding population, as now the female can potentially breed with her own offspring (all male). It does limit the gene pool and I’m not sure how this affects dominant or recessive traits in the population. I’d expect minimally, because asexual reproduction usually only happens in a population with no males, which I suspect isn’t common.
