I don't care if I'm being downvoted, I'm sorry if the truth doesn't align with your personal beliefs. I should also clarify that I am not claiming that Antifa is worse or just as bad as the KKK. I'm merely stating that Antifa has failed in its purpose from the beginning and has not had the reason to see why beating and silencing all that oppose you, as well as intentional fear mongering is considered fascism."

He always signs everything as that, and needs to bring in his birth certificate when ever he needs to prove his name isn't a troll or fake. His name won't fit on his learner's permit, and he was told he had to pick a name. Lead to both his parents going absolutely nuts over whether he loved either one of them. They can never accept both.
