sugarfree,ffjtddt,t3_etwsgh,1580006416.0,"I like the tip about eating something naturally sweet to keep cravings and overeating in check. It works for me, I just forget to do it! Thanks for the reminder!"
ABoringDystopia,ffjlyiq,t1_ffiqwz1,1580001300.0,"Right? I wasn’t even asking for something stronger, I was asking for extra strength Tylenol and toradol (sp?) which is just iv ibuprofen. My husband was so mad. 

I’ve had some nurses that were wonderful, but some that were not so much, and I don’t like that there’s such a high chance of getting a grumpy nurse."
ABoringDystopia,ffipgoa,t1_ffi52pa,1579979461.0,"I had a nurse give me a hard time after my c-section too. For some reason, opioids don’t do much for me for pain, so when I was in terrible pain, she didn’t really believe me. I couldn’t even get out of bed without 9/10 pain to get into the wheelchair, don’t act like I’m being a drama queen. I just had two tiny humans extracted from my belly 20 hours ago."
oddlysatisfying,ffih5o0,t1_ffhz87i,1579973763.0,"It is, imo, because I have two kids in the cart (twins) and I have to unbuckle them one by one, put them in the other cart and rebuckle them, which surely takes more time than just waiting until I unload everything (which I always do really fast anyway.) It’s one of the few things I don’t like about Aldi."

parentsofmultiples,ff92pa9,t3_es64re,1579703379.0,"Wow, I hate that you’re getting so many negative comments about how people would hate your life. I think your babies are adorable and I so wish I could have a second set of twins!"

casualknitting,ff4qlx5,t3_erjycd,1579570082.0,I love those colors
RedPillWomen,ff4qj25,t1_ff4ku7l,1579570028.0,"I use CeraVe too, and it’s one of the few things that my sensitive skin can handle. It’s very gentle and works great."
BarefootandPregnant,ff4m3ps,t1_ff4lbn3,1579566922.0,"That book (Smokehouse Ham) is the *perfect* resource for that. My dad has a copy, and I picked it up one day and liked it so much that I immediately went home and ordered my own copy. 

I just looked up Victuals and it looks like it’s right up my alley. It’s going in my wish list!"
BanPitBulls,ff4k0it,t1_ff3icoj,1579565470.0,There’s not a thing wrong with eating squirrels! Don’t you bring squirrels into this!
BarefootandPregnant,ff4i6b9,t3_eri6py,1579564200.0,"I have a ton of cookbooks. My favorites are probably “Smokehouse Ham, Spoon Bread and Scuppernong Wine,” then “Nourishing Traditions” and also “The Practical Produce Cookbook.”

Recipes that I’ve found online I like to print out and put in a three ring binder so I can have a physical copy.

ETA: The Smokehouse Ham cookbook reads almost like a history book of the southern Appalachians, with tons of recipes thrown in, so I do sit down from time to time and read it like a book."
Adulting,ff4esf8,t3_erflc5,1579561891.0,It dissipates quickly. :)
Permaculture,ff4dt8h,t3_erhvao,1579561241.0,So much green! Beautiful!
Dogfree,ff4auad,t1_fenuptm,1579559317.0,That is awful. I wish I knew how to change it. Humans are worth so much more than animals.
AbandonedPorn,ff32s3e,t1_ff008k0,1579532185.0,"I *think* Atlanta has done ok, the big stadium was turned into Turner Field where the Braves played up until a few years ago and now GSU uses it, and they used Lake Lanier for the rowing stuff which is of course a big local attraction, and the park where they did all the horse stuff is now a city park, my husband plays music at the cherry blossom festival there each spring. I could easily be missing some things though as I was just a kid when the Olympics came through.

Edit to add: not that all of this waste is by any means ok - if the cities aren’t going to keep using them, then stop having the Olympics there.

Edit to add 2: Apparently the ownership of the Olympic tennis courts were transferred to Gwinnett County and were in use until ~2007 but have now been slated for demolition."

TumblrInAction,fevxs4a,t3_eq4hle,1579402864.0,"My husband is in a Celtic band and wears a kilt. You would not believe the amount of women who think it’s ok to lift up his kilt. Like, hello! What would you do if some pervert lifted up your skirt??"
fatlogic,fevwhpr,t1_fetnptw,1579402318.0,The phrase “eye injections” alone is enough to make me never overeat again.

Anarcho_Capitalism,fevvmxl,t1_fev0hf6,1579401985.0,"Very ridiculous considering I’m a married mother of 5 and have never watched anime. Actually, I’m much more libertarian than my husband who occasionally watches anime, ha."
