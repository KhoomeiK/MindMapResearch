worldnews,fcbaoyn,t3_egvrh7,1577584553.0,"To anyone who read the article and isn't sure about Sydney Mayor Clover Moore, she's one of the best mayors Sydney's had in ages and I believe if the money were not already spent she would be willing to divert some of the firework fund to the RFS. 

In my personal opinion the Sydney fireworks are not for the locals, they're for tourists. I could probably count the amount of friends who have been to see the fireworks in the harbour in the last few years on one hand. Many Sydneysiders are starting being charged by their local councils to see their local fireworks due to the crowds. I'm not going to watch the Sydney fireworks for the first time in my life this year (mainly because I'm on holiday and away from a tele), but I don't feel the need to continue watching them as they're honestly kind of boring."
