woooosh,fe7verw,t3_enz0dv,1578919615.0,"The statement ""feminism is hateful"" is pretty one sided if you ask me. Sure, there are batshit crazy ""feminists"" who'll get a breakdown when a man is breathing. But those are only the ones you see on Twitter or whatever. The definition of feminism is in fact what that person said. The movement isn't changing either and I have no idea what that dude is talking about. ""Feminists"" who hate men should *not* be called feminist as they don't stay true to that definition—which *won't* change. If anything, they should be called something else."

awfuleverything,fcz7dy8,t1_fcx0ssh,1578095168.0,Yeah I've tried a few GAN softwares but never developed or modified anything. It's still machine learning. I was trying to use general terms but I guess I failed since neural network is sometimes referred to as AI as well. And I understand now that neural network is a type of machine learning and not vice versa. Thanks.
awfuleverything,fcz4xoz,t1_fcx3sw2,1578093748.0,Thank you. At least I was correct in that deep fake is a neural network which was the purpose of the reply. Though I couldn't call a virtual agent unpredictable.
awfuleverything,fcwwbra,t1_fcw22gi,1578040358.0,"It's a neural network, not an AI.

AI is made to interact with a given environment based on information given to it. Making it more predictable.
A neural network instead processes the information and formulates its own result. Always unpredictable. It can be combined with machine learning which they used to make the deep fake software. I'm not an expert. Just something I read once.

Edit: Again, I'm not an expert so feel free to correct me. I only wrote what I *think* I remember."
