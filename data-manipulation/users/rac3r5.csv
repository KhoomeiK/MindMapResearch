Yes, Surrey has a large South Asian population so the probability of South Asians voting and South Asian businesses supporting someone will be high.

Were they just collecting a paycheck and being clueless about what they were greenlighting.

Also, the FAA incompetence also extends to other regulatory bodies. I worked for a Major IT medical company that was FDA and ISO regulated and there were holes in the way they approved things. I worked in Implementations so I've done a few things like build and configure servers all the way to configuring and implementing the SW. A few things stood out to me.

1) No mechanism to ensure critical bugs were actually addressed. E.g. I reported the same bug for 2 different projects that our application server was dropping messages it received from other hospital systems when the load got too high. It got put on the backlog to be addressed at a future date.

2) Every order consisted of multipe types of servers. And each order would have a different standardized configuration depending on the customer needs. After building each server, we would be required to complete a regulatory body mandated and approved checklist to ensure the servers were built properly. We had a checklist for each type of server built, but not configuration specific. This ended up in us only checking boxes that applied to us, instead of the checklist making sure we completed things that needed to be completed. There was so much noise in that checklist, that if someone messes up, it would be a spiderweb to figure out what. The saving grace was that the folks that did their jobs were good at it so they knew what they were doing while building. 

3) I once got loaned to the testing department. The tester needed some help with testing. Some testing was sent to India. The testing was for an upgrade and I was a SME on the SW as I was then a senior system integrator. I configured and deployed these systems for customers. While testing, I noticed that some of the test cases didn't apply or even make sense, but the folks from India were just passing everything. I asked the test lead what was going on and he said he just took an old template and applied it to the update. *Sigh*

4) The last one I can remember is our server SW configurations. We had different types of servers in an order, serving different purposes. Each server had one or many configuration files stored in text files. A typical deployment has 8 servers. We had to juggle configuring all these servers by hand and understand what configurations would conflict with other settings. There was no configuration management system to tell you if you chose those setting on system x, it would conflict with a setting on system Y. You can see where this is going. For the most part, ppl knew their stuff, but we're human and ppl can mess up or the host names given during the build changed by the customer and it got missed while reviewing a sea if text in the text file."

chocolate,fdtzzue,t3_emzjz7,1578725066.0,"Hi there, I recently got my diploma in Chocolate making so I might be able to answer some of your questions. I'm Canadian so my temperatures are in Celcius.

Let's first talk about tempering. 
The chocolate melting machine we used at school, the chocolate was kept at 45 deg, as you don't want it too hot otherwise you will break down some components in the chocolate. Next you want to temper the chocolate by bringing it to 25 degrees. We do this to activate the beta 5 fats. There are different fats in chocolates, but the one you care about is beta 5. Beta 5 gives the chocolate its snap, sheen/gloss, releases aroma and helps it melt evenly in your mouth. 

After tempering, you bring the chocolate up to 32 deg for dark, 30 for milk and 28 for white chocolate. When the chocolate is at this temp, it is easy to work with and the beta 5 crystals are still activated and it cools down rather quickly after you put it in a mould.

Speaking of moulds, we warmed up our cocoa butter colours by putting the butter in a warm bath. If it got cold while working, we would put the blow torch against the coco butter very quickly, I.e. a fraction of a second to heat it up and then work with it. Sometimes we would also use a microwave to heat up the cocoa butter in the microwave. 

Spray guns: we would use metal spray guns and if the cocoa butter got cold, we would use a blow torch to heat it up. Remember you don't want to boil the cocoa butter. 

After putting the cocoa butter in the moulds, we would put them in the fridge. When you fill your moulds with chocolate, if the chocolate is the right temperature it will melt the cocoa butter enough to adhere to your chocolate. If it's too cold, or too warm  you'll encounter problems, like the cocoa butter not sticking to the chocolate properly. Having a machine that tempers chocolates makes life easier,  as you would just pour the chocolate into the moulds, but understanding the basics is important. We tempered by hand to better understand the chocolate. 

Let me know if you have any other questions. In the next 3 months, I'm hoping to get a YouTube channel up and running on the chemistry of things."

Additionally, there are some restrictions depending on how you connect your data to your data source which should be looked at. Look at the implications of Import vs Direct query connection methods. Not sure what the difference is with Tableau.  But with Import, your dataset cannot be more than 1GB but with Direct Query you don't have that but you are however limited by the number of features you can use.
