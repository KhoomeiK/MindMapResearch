GossipGirl,ffpt6wh,t3_epavtp,1580104797.0,IMO Serena's hair looks amazing that episode. That is all. Have a nice day.
GossipGirl,ffpsp0o,t1_fexr098,1580104287.0,"She didn't give up Yale for Blair. She says that she never wanted to go to Yale when Blair says something like""why did you do that? And don't say for me, because even I won't believe that"""
GossipGirl,ffpskfk,t3_eqsrq2,1580104158.0,"For everyone talking about the rape attempts, it was early in the show and the writers hadn't figured out yet that they didn't want him to be a villain"
GossipGirl,ffprz2i,t3_ery22r,1580103572.0,Rolling in the deep
GossipGirl,ffpry8a,t3_es5rfr,1580103550.0,"Beca? (Blair, Eric, Chuck, Allison) idk lol"
GossipGirl,ffprrhx,t1_ff9is3c,1580103369.0,I think it was just normal gossip posted on the website like the first post he talks about was Serena and some scandal that everyone knew about so
GossipGirl,ffprlr6,t1_ff8pki9,1580103214.0,Omg Blair and Jack was so terrible! IMO they could've done the how could you hotel breakup without that having already happened
GossipGirl,ffprie3,t3_es9u44,1580103121.0,I hate Bart not being dead and not getting redeemed in general. Every parent on the upper east side seemed to have been a terrible parent in the past but grown to be better except for him
GossipGirl,ffpqyi2,t1_ffhnj9r,1580102595.0,That has gotta be one of my favorite episodes! It shows so much emotional depth in Blair's character while also being funny and giving viewers ample Chair moments.
GossipGirl,ffpqmc2,t1_ffd5mbe,1580102278.0,That Bassterd!
GossipGirl,ffpq5t2,t1_fffin5a,1580101852.0,But he was supposed to read the emails and post the ones he thought was worthy
GossipGirl,ffpq2uy,t1_fff8y2c,1580101775.0,"Ya like Jenny posts after she didn't want attention anymore, the affair he had with his teacher posts, is Dan cheating posts, the secret child post, the pregnancy scare post, etc. I could go on. It is really not convincing in the early seasons. 

One of the most annoying things though was that Jenny was supposed to know the whole time and sometimes I wondered how she didn't just spit out at him about gossip girl everytime he judged her for wanting to climb the social ladder. 

And how the heck did Chuck get him to post that fake blast about Muffy when Blair was babysitting that virgin girl for Yale?"
GossipGirl,ffppjtd,t1_ffhmiy6,1580101290.0,That would be a great reveal actually...
GossipGirl,ffppgu8,t1_ffhjw5c,1580101216.0,"Ik!! And the worst part is he got off on acting like a good guy the entire time. You know he said ""I am the most understanding person in the world"" to Serena the first time they broke up? And she just accepted it? Like he is one of the most judgemental characters I have ever seen!"
GossipGirl,ffpp9h0,t3_etlsih,1580101030.0,"I think a lot was wrong about Serena and Dan but they could always be salvaged until the show did this. The reason they broke up in the first place is because Serena was dishonest and now she finds out that Dan had been lying to her for years about this and she just shrugs it off?

Also I hate how Blair was the only person to say how terrible it was and how everyone basically told Blair that she just wishes she was GG. Like no! This dude is a manipulative lying rat! And IDC if he stopped after the accident! The matter of the fact is that the accident happened and it wouldn't have if it wasn't for him."
GossipGirl,ffpowl0,t1_ffgx1dd,1580100719.0,Omg I just came from a 2x19 scene where she said that about Blair!
GossipGirl,ffpotaj,t3_etfxit,1580100639.0,I think the idea was that everyone was there out of respect for each other but didn't actually wanna be there because the actual event was boring and stuffy until Jenny's fashion show came in
Tangled,ffopr7o,t1_ffmisro,1580080276.0,Wait so they aren’t engaged? Dang it! I thought that they finally managed to get it done!
Tangled,ffonq8y,t1_ffo11uj,1580079654.0,This is the perfect response omg
