I will, by way of comforting you, say that when I was a kid I saw an animal in a roadside zoo that looked like a cross between a rabbit and a coyote, and the owner had a perfectly plausible story about a small litter of two like this and one just a coyote pup-- which he also still had--that had been brought to him by a Native. He said one of them died and the one he was keeping he didn't take to the university in Billings, Montana, USA, because he didn't want it to be messed with in a laboratory.  Anyhow, I know I saw it, but nobody ever believed me. I told it in school and got in trouble for ""lying.""  I stopped telling about it until I was in my 30s, got drunk with a zoologist and told her the story.  She said she believed me, saying that stuff like that happens out there in the wild.  Science either doesn't hear about it or can't replicate it so it just fades out of the picture. I believe you, Bro. Weird shit happens out there.

Edit: She told me that if weird shit like this didn't happen out there we wouldn't have so many species of creatures on Earth."
