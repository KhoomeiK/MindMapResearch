todayilearned,ffm275t,t3_eu4zeu,1580047285.0,That's all nice and lovely but then you have assholes like the Bush family.  Take Jeb.  During his primary he talked about how sacred the office was and how only someone with such holy blood like his should be president.  I'm pretty sure he would have Smithers shoot the fucker and roll him in the whitehouse carpet.  Clinton on the other hand would watch the show while getting his dick sucked.
JoeRogan,ffk2v8w,t3_etudne,1580014113.0,What do you expect from a scabby bitch that sat in a chair laughing with Hillary Clinton about how women have progressed because now they too can fight in wars on the front lines and get in credit card debt.  Two women who can no longer bare children talking and congratulating how great it is your uterus still works so that your child can die for corporate interests.  Lovely.
JoeRogan,ffix5l6,t1_ffiwael,1579984877.0,Good on ya.  20 odd years ago I trusted the Guardian but unfortunately their standards ( like their crap photos) dropped.  No one is mentioning that Hillary was late to endorse gay rights and marriage while Bernie did.  The people moaning are the same type that get upset when an underground artist becomes popular.

They would evacuate into a country that they have military bases in because they (military industrial complex government) don't give a shit about working class US soldiers or a ""shithole"" country.  I hope it's not you.  Edit 2: And the US mainstream media would never ever mention it.  Lol."

JoeRogan,ffi3v7f,t3_eto7ut,1579964319.0,"I saw an article on the BBC website about this.  I don't normally go to them but it came up as I was googling to get on Reddit.  In bold letters half way down the article was a bold sub title along the lines of ""why this endorsement is problematic"".  Maybe it's problematic for news/cable networks (and ridiculous institutions that require people to pay for their content by law) because Rogan has people that actually choose to watch him and his podcast has become mainstream in my eyes, I say that as someone who watched early on and got a shock when people in my family started saying they listened too."

Someone posted in /r/askreddit asking what got their goat the most and I had to do shit and couldn't contribute, so I'm gonna jump in the fire here and say fuck off acronym assholes.  My personal pet peeve on Reddit.  It's annoying (and frankly rude as fuck).  I find myself conflicted here coz of the bush fires.  I thought 'F' meant fires or firies.  I know Aussies like to abbreviate and just make up words like Shakespeare; but acronyms piss me off.  There I said it.  Bad timing wouldn't be my first."

Documentaries,fds82wm,t3_emiad2,1578696484.0,He was a very manipulative individual.  Very can't be stressed enough.  Now everyone is talking about how he died and not what he did.  Let's keep focusing on how this turd died.  Everyone including his handmaiden gets off Scott free.
cycling,fds7988,t1_fds6mjj,1578695942.0,Thank you for your response.  I think I really need to look into the matter further in terms of epilepsy since I am aware that in certain places people can be given licenses if they are X number of months/ years free of a fit.  You and u/Noxiousdogclould have raised the issue about battery longevity and you stressed safety as a factor.  It's all worth taking on board.

I would wonder how this kind of bike light could affect someone with this condition when the benefits to the biker are no different essentially to a regular front beam.

worldnews,fdldzoa,t3_elwase,1578521990.0,This seems counterproductive and just appeasing / fanning the flames.  There is no reason to press an issue at this moment unless you are going to have a plan to observe the truth.  Either that's military action or an acceptance of apology.  I suppose doing this now has the advantage of hiding behind the world not wanting to create a war and Iran not wanting to look weak.  I guess this statement was his own version of a diplomatic wave of dick.
