He gave over transcripts where hes asking a foreign country to investigate someone thats running for President against him. That alone is an impeachable offense and unconstitutional. Regardless of if he held out on aid or not. And thats already been established by the fucking text of the phone calls that Trump himself released.

MarvelStudiosSpoilers,ffvg51u,t1_ffup7sx,1580263331.0,"I think its just a matter of taste man. Because I really enjoyed Rogue One. Last Jedi not so much. It may just be a difference of philosophies. For me the story of Star Wars was about the Skywalkers. Period. Making the hero of the Star Wars trilogy not a Skywalker ruined the whole thing. Thats why Im not a fan of the new one either. 

But when I see something I like I want to see more of what I like. Different doesnt equal good. Thats why the MCU is my favorite thing in all of movies. They all tell stories, maybe its just not the story you want to hear. And thats fine, you can literally go see any other movie to see something different. If Im going to see a Star Wars movie. Thats what I want. A Star Wars movie. If its the main Star Wars movie I want it based around a Skywalker. I want the heroes to be heroes. I want sith, I want lightsabre battles. I want cool space fights. I dont want a 2 hour long slow speed car chase. I dont want to see an hour long heist side mission that means nothing. I dont want to see some dick measuring contest between an established hero of the previous film and some nobody that is somehow meant to be the embodiment of a strong woman. I dont want to see some random mechanic say they are going to beat the enemy with love. I dont give a fuck about love. I want the enemy beaten with lightsabres and space missiles. Love can fuck right off.

This is where you have to pick what you want. Because youre right. This is a reason Frank Rizzo was so loved in Philly. I know people think he was hated here, but for most of the residents, he wasnt. Because of this. He chose to have more armed officers with the authority to overlook civil liberties over crime. NY chose the other way. Thats why in the 70s and early 80s NY was a crime riddled warzone while Philly was pretty much the same as it had always been.

Dont get me wrong, I dont think Philly is anywhere near where NY was back then, but the truth is NY didnt clean up until Guiliani took a page from Rizzos book and gave the cops carte blanche to do whatever it took to clean up the city.

Look youre not gonna get any sympathy from me. Im a bartender and I can tell you right now theres nobody in the entire restaurant industry that pays taxes on 100% of their income."
technology,ffikh3u,t1_ffijhs4,1579976027.0,"Heres the best part, when I get change I just put it in a little tupperware container in my car. Now I always have change for a meter, money for tolls, or have an extra couple of dollars if I need it and I dont have to keep the change in my pocket! Pennies I throw on the street so kids have something to find.

I find it even funnier how its a ""chore"" to carry money around. LMFAO You carry a wallet with your credit cards, right? They have ones with a magnetic clip that you can slide those 6 or 7 pieces of paper in it as well. How is that a chore??? Shit Im 43 and whenever I see my father he asks me how much money I have on me. And if its not enough for his liking he makes me take some from him because he doesnt understand how anyone can be out of the house without at least $100 on them. Its hilarious."
technology,ffik1oq,t1_ffib0vm,1579975729.0,"> My main reason for justifying the banning of cash-only joints is simply the fact that doing so would cut down on illegal endeavours. The plain reason being that businesses choose to deal with cash tend to involve aspects avoid paying tax.. It would also cut down in the ability of money laundering and corruption.

Those arent good enough reasons."
technology,ffijyys,t1_ffi720q,1579975677.0,You work in the restaurant industry and are for cashless business? That takes away one of the biggest draws of working in the restaurant business.
technology,ffijvre,t1_ffi7kwe,1579975616.0,My landscaper gives me a $5 discount on every cut if I pay in cash because he doesnt have to charge me tax because hes not paying it. Same with my barber.
technology,ffijpr9,t1_ffi9jws,1579975501.0,"2 things.

1. They have to pay a fee on every CC transaction. Regardless of how many people leave if they dont take credit cards, if they are a busy business they lose more money with the fees.

2. They save 100 times what you would spend in there store on taxes because its way easier to underreport your income when all your sales are cash."
technology,ffijj62,t1_ffi7tx4,1579975376.0,Except cash.
technology,ffijh9x,t1_ffiefki,1579975341.0,Got that right. Bartender here. Cash is king at my bar.
technology,ffijejl,t1_ffi6b4b,1579975287.0,I dot understand anyone that doesnt carry both.
technology,ffijd2s,t1_ffi57d9,1579975260.0,"Yourte getting downvoted but I dont get it either. I would never leave my fucking house without cash. And if I was going anywhere other than to run an errand, Id have at least $100 on me. I honestly dont understand someone that doesnt carry cash. If theres some kind of massive power outage or just the credit card reader goes down they are fucked."
technology,ffij5o5,t1_ffhzjmt,1579975121.0,Problem is they actually have to pay a portion of their profit every time someone uses a credit card in their business. It doesnt cost them anything to take cash.
technology,ffiimo4,t1_ffi71bq,1579974761.0,No. It doesnt.
