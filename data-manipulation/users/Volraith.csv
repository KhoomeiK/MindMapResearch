So whatever they can possibly do to make more money, even if it's illegal, they do it.

Take Purdue pharmaceutical for instance. They make a drug called oxycontin.

Now I don't have the numbers in front of me (posting from mobile) but let's say they've made a billion dollars off of the sale of this drug, which is being misproscribed, misused, and it's killing people.

In most cases, after they've made that billion dollars, if they're found guilty of a crime that they've profited from, they'll be fined say $50,000,000 by the government.

A slap on the wrist, a drop in the bucket, and breaking the law still nets them a ***huge profit.*** 

So Purdue laughs at the fine because they probably get more than that in* tax breaks every year, and they continue to do whatever the fuck they want.

That's how America works. Big business kills people, the government takes a little more of their money, and the truck keeps rolling."

Recently beat **Super Mario World** which to me was always the best SNES game. I've always enjoyed 2D Mario platformers. I like exploring the levels and looking for different paths.

Working my way through **Super Punch-Out.** I find this game difficult but not to the point where I stop playing. Currently stuck on Mr. Sandman.

Picked up a few 360 games at one of my local retro game stores. Got all three for $10 total so, nothing wrong with that.

**Watch Dogs** boy do I kind of wish I had bought this one on PS4. The graphics on the 360 version are kind of rough. Enjoying the game despite the fact that Aiden seems to be omni capable.

**Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway:** Never played any in this series but I was in the mood for a WWII game. So far very unimpressed with this one. Graphics are bad, I swear I sat through 15-20 minutes of cutscene before the game started, and the mechanics are very clunky. Honestly probably not going to touch this one again.

Haven't actually started **Assassin's Creed IV** yet. Picked it up because I'm interested in some pirate action, and some redditors assured me it's more pirate than AC themed. I've never played any of the AC games, just not my thing. So I hope they're right."
