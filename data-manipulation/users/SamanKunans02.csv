Next, be able to pass a physical.

After that, go to boot camp.

Once in boot camp, your sense of self-worth is widdled down to nothing through slight relentless physical torture for about 4 weeks. 

After 4 weeks, instill a new sense of value, one which raises the individual above the self, forming each individual into part of a greater collective.

Then specialized training.

Then you ship them home (we are here), and the individual is stuck between being who they were and who they've become. This may look like self-confidence, but it's mostly the individual trying to make sense of who they were with what they've just done.

Then you ship the collective individual hero to New Jersey or some shit for a couple of years where they can find a spouse or enjoy a high APR on an automobile and start a gun collection.

Then a couple of months go by and the boot enters a game of office politics for the remainder of their career. The grand illusion of being an army of one wavers and reality sets in as you've got a wife, kid, car payments and no marketable skills.

You get out and join an iron workers union. You notice everyone around you is either really young or strung out. You go on your first job site and follow around a journeyman who is the same age is you. 

You don't tell him you are jealous, but you see this vision of a man you could have been. Single, property owning with disposable income.
