Using force, even when it isn't dramatic, can cause behavioural fallout."

dogs,ffhei0s,t1_ffhe65a,1579931941.0,"I don't full agree with the people vs organization issue. The management and ethics of the organization really matter, as does the training they provide for staff and volunteers. And retail rescues are morally bankrupt organizations.


I can't really answer all those questions, because I deal with behaviour, not the adoption process, and I'm there to solve a problem. 
Generally people want a good family pet or companion animal, and usually what people want is transparency from the rescue."

dogs,ffhcgli,t1_ffhaob6,1579929819.0,"often times, yes. The most common issue I see is people wanting a nice level headed family pet, but get taken in by emotional (and sometimes downright manipulative) language and the whole ""who rescued who"" stuff, ending up with a dog they're not prepared for.

There are a LOT of rescue organizations where I am, and some of them are really really awful. There are also lots of very responsible and ethical ones too though, and we tend to see their dogs in post-purchase training less often."
dogs,ffh56bs,t1_ffh0214,1579923413.0,"That's fair, but it's a descriptor that gives accurate information to potential adopters.

dogs,ffd1yl3,t1_ffd1gzg,1579811820.0,"See this is the end result of just assuming that all breeders treat dogs as commodities, which isn't true. There is so much information as to why it's best for the person with years of experience and who has been raising these dogs for 8 weeks, and knows their relatives extremely well, and gets to see them all day every day for 8 weeks out there.

All I can say is we had assessed my current dog as being very high energy and high drive, and that his personality would make him a challenging dog. A friend of mine, who has another puppy from this litter (that's how we met) thought he was the chillest because the 3 times they visited he was napping. Guess who was right?"

Preach!!!

There are people who have been in dogs for 30+ years who I would ***NEVER*** allow to handle my dogs, and I work with some truly amazing first time owners.


I actually did the easy mode dog first, and he *was* the right choice then, but he's honestly just kind of a couch ornament now. He does training and goes on adventures and all that, but you're right, there has been a lot of frustration there."
dogs,ffcn1th,t1_ffcmlp4,1579802935.0,Because I know how to structurally analyze an 8 week old puppy? Just because you don't know what you're talking about doesn't mean I'm wrong

dogs,ffcb4x2,t1_ffbnkas,1579795630.0,"Jeeze you guys are talking to some shit people. There are lots of truly wonderful people breeding dogs.

All those things they do are to protect their puppies and ensure they jave the best possible life.

I help evaluate some puppies. We had a big debate between two homes and two puppies recently. One wanted to do a high impact sport, but were primarily a pet home with active older kids. The other was a hunting home, which has less joint impact, but were an older couple. These two puppies, one was the perfect temperment for the older couple, but he had much stronger hocks than his sister, who had a temperment more suited to the sport home. It was a LONG debate and many other factors came into play.

Now the reason you can't pick your puppy os you 1. Have no access to all that information and 2. Aren't experienced enough to make the assessment. 

When another breeder with oodles of experience bought a puppy, she picked. Because she knows more than the rest of us combined."
dogs,ffcanp5,t1_ffbxjfc,1579795326.0,I mean you don't have to choose to buy that puppy and sign that contract. If you don't agree with the contract don't sign it.
dogs,ffcadp3,t1_ffbw98w,1579795155.0,"That's so sad that you feel this way. I have so many lifelong friends who I met because they bought a dog from my breeder. Two of them became the dog I'm raising's breeder, they're basically my adopted aunt and uncle. We have meetups and tea and go to events as a group. My dog's whole litter ended up being placed within driving distance, so they're still all the very best of friends.
His breeders are a wealth of knowledge, and myself and them offer huge amounts of support. I will move mountains for their puppy buyers.

People who both don't pick their breeder well and then just never contact them again are really missing out."

dogs,ffbaj6a,t1_ffb29cf,1579757499.0,Same. I've straight up had to twist a dog's collar and fully lify him off the ground before. It's not pretty but it works. Also a hand right behind the skull is not a hand getting bit.

puppy101,ff9cskp,t3_esdrcr,1579710108.0,"Not inherently, no. If the dog shows signs of worry we can address that. Dogs are way more flexible than people think.

My schedule is super inconsitant, my dogs deal. Honestly I like it because it means if something comes up they're not stressing out. Usually they get fed at 8 am. Sometimes 10. Sometimes they go for a walk at the crack of dawn, sometimes noon. Sometimes they visit their breeder. Sometimes someone else comes and gives them dinner or picks them up for an outing. They roll with the punches really well."

Dogtraining,ff9car4,t1_ff9a4f2,1579709731.0,"This. I actually start with an equal reward schedule for both dogs. So dog A sits and dog B is still on their place, both dogs get rewarded. Once they are happy to stay on their place, randomize it, and switch dogs at random, varying the amount of time they need to be on their place.

Training sessions should be short, ~5 minutes, so they don't need to be on their place for that long."
