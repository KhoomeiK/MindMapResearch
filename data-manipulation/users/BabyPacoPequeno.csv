depression,ffha76p,t3_etgu0i,1579927648.0,My cat recently died and now I just want join her.
StarWars,ffajnso,t1_ffahnxu,1579737395.0,Now that would be a really interesting way to incorporate the two. Like Vader has a mole in the Inquisitor program.
StarWars,ffahchg,t1_ffagqrf,1579735756.0,"The reason star killer would mean something to Vader is he wants to rid himself of palpatine. Again I'm not super familiar with the Inquisitors as I've only just started rebels and know them from fallen order, but aren't they loyal to the empire and Vader is kinda their manager with palpatine as the boss haha? Afaik their purpose is to hunt surviving Jedi. Star killer would be someone Vader expressly trained for helping him kill palpatine and then becoming his formal apprentice. Something I don't think he would trust any Inquisitor with. Again I'm not super familiar so correct me if I'm wrong."
StarWars,ffagj1g,t1_ffageem,1579735222.0,Is there any reason why he can't still be Vader's secret apprentice? It's not uncommon for sith to do this as sidious and tyranus did.
StarWars,ffae0jl,t1_ffadsae,1579733378.0,"Totally agree. I'm not sure if any of star killers story conflicts with the current canon, but if not, I don't see a reason why they can't canonize him in some way while also not making him as ludicrously strong as he was in the games."
FallenOrder,ffa5ue3,t1_ff9y8fk,1579728470.0,Duraplast. It's my favorite too.
