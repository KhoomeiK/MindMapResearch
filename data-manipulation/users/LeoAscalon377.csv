AskScienceFiction,ff6jhco,t3_ervanf,1579628519.0,"There's two kinds of AI, dumb and smart. Dumb AI appear to have limited self-awareness and tend to be specialized in one specific task, even if the definition of that task is rather broad. Their personalities are capable of being designed and optimised for their function as far a it can be shown, it's kinda hard to tell because they're never really seen that often.

Smart AI are a completely different entity entirety. For starters they are essentially digital humans and they are extremely hard to create relatively speaking because for starters; you need a donor brain from a human(usually deceased) to scan to form the basis of the smart AI personality matrix. Thanks to them being more or less a digital copy of a human brain allows the AI to be a fully cognizant and self-aware independent entity. They are often given specializations but at their core, they're just as capable of learning self-improvement of a human being. This is actually what kills them is that they keep absorbing information and thinking untill they eventually get obsessed on something and they dedicate more processing power to their inquiries than running their basic processes, or they go batshit insane. Either way this leads to smart AI having a average lifespan of seven-ish years. Don't feel to bad though, Smart AI experience and process information so quickly they tend to think of humans as glacially slow for the most part. Smart AI's tend to choose their names and their personal avatars as a reflection of their personalities which are a weird mix of phantom memories for lack of a better term, their experiences, and specializations. Hell the effect of the phantom memories can have a fairly strong influence on the type of person an AI prefers dealing with, for example Cortana and her interactions with the Spartans and Miranda Keyes. As for why there has been so many smart AI as of late, I'm assuming the covenant' s attempted genocide of humanity made for an abundant supply of viable donors from the raw casualties alone.

Edit: also I doubt even dumb AI are commodity items because whenever we do see even dumb AI, they tend to be used for rather serious tasks ranging as the embodiment of an automated city to being the avatar of a military communications network to a dedicated teacher. If dumb AI are commodity items, then they're very very expensive. And Smart AI are sole ly government and military assets."
MurderedByWords,ff5orgh,t1_ff5o7p6,1579603695.0,No. Im thinking of the results of taxing somebody on an income that is mostly theoretical vs actual income. It's one thing for a person's property to be supposedly valued for a certain amount and taxing said person for that amount.

Now back to China.
I didn't say that they would launch an attack on the continental U.S.
I only mentioned some hawkish elements of their government want to start said theoretical war;

I only pointed out that a war with China on their terms when they want it would be bad.
Or even if it's not ideal for them, it's still bad for everyone else because if they did attack a Nato power or a U.S. ally, mutual defense clauses would be in effect.
