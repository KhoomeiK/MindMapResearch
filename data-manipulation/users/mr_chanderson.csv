The road was very straight, and at the end of it is an intersection with a traffic light and a crosswalk. I slowed down for the red light, but my vehicle kept going kuh-kuh-kuh forward on the snow.

A girl started crossing, not looking (she does have the way, pedestrian cross sign was green) and I pushed harder on the brakes, all the way down and the vehicle still kept going kuh-kuh-kuh. In my mind I was going oh shit oh shit oh shit and I didn't think about using the horn, just like you I'm very conflict avoidant, I almost never use the horn.

WTF,fek2upa,t1_fejvdp2,1579191432.0,"It depends where you are in Reddit. With the way that it's designed, having different subreddits will no doubt attract like minded people who have the same interests into those subs, thus creating the echo chamber/hive mind mentality you speak of.

On the contrary, I find the opposite of your statement to be what's funny. People believing that Reddit is a single mind. Again, it is made up by millions of minds. Yes there are moments a majority of them pull together on certain topics and wholeheartedly agree on something, while the minority who don't agree gets downvoted. But that still doesn't make it a single mind, and to say Reddit is hypocritical is just... I don't know, odd.

It's not like everyone on Reddit comes from the same background (there's always the assumption that the person on the other side is a male Caucasian from the U.S.A.). Everyone is different, from different parts of the world, different class, different culture, different educational background. But with so many people, I reiterate: there's bound to have large clusters of users who agrees with each other, some who disagrees. Off the top of my head, I can already think of 3 hot topics that people are passionate about who gets really triggered/riled up about: pronunciation of the word ""gif"", circumcision, and gun rights.

> most moral decisions come down to a lesser-of-two evils in the non-ideal world we live in.

I agree with that. However, this is *different* (I couldn't tell if this was more complicated or just simpler but grander. Why not both?). For us, we see the lesser of evils is Zeke's path, to them it's not just *us or them* it's *all* of us, or *all* of them.

In history, there were individual people or a group of people who committed self sacrifice for the greater good, but I don't know if there is an example in history where, not just a group, but a *whole* race, nation, culture that decided to commit self genocide for the greater good of the world. There may have been a whole tribe or even a nation who went all in in a battle/war and have all their people wiped out, but they still went fighting. A leader may make a decision to sacrifice a group of their own people, but not all of themselves.

Perhaps a long drawn out war would be the lesser evil than Zeke and Eren's path. Millions will die, but there is a chance that no whole nation or culture would be wiped out. Remember that Zeke and Eren are both really messed up in their mind. Both of their upbringing was messed up. Both of them have powers that is God amongst men, and they both went to try and achieve powers that is literally God of titans and Eldians. They're messed up, they have powers, both of them are going the extreme ends of both spectrums (Zeke a little less extreme, rather than just immediately wipe out all Eldians, he's letting them live out the final moments of their whole race, their whole culture).

In this non-ideal world, most of us would hypothetically choose the lesser of evils even if it means there's a massive sacrifice, *if* that sacrifice doesn't involve *me* (me as in those people who would hypothetically choose that). I see this in discussions about population control. Whether it be about eliminating a large portion of the population or removing the ability to reproduce in a large population. The people in favor for it always favor it in a way that's not them, like ""let's eliminate all the stupid people hurr durr."" (just a stupid extreme example, I know). It's human nature to think ""It'll never be me. It'll never happen to me. I'm not not stupid. *They're* stupid."" But when it comes to it happening to someone they know, they care, then it's all like ""No! Let me be the one! I volunteer to be sacrifice in place of them!"". 

I think Eren is knowingly sacrificing himself right now. Sacrificing his own humanity for the people that he loves and care on the island. For his home. His people. *His world*. He has nothing else to lose. His family is all dead and gone except Mikasa. He only has a few years left. He has no connection to the world outside except those people that lived in the desert and provided him and his friends hospitality, but we all saw he was sad what's going to happen to them. He still made his decision to choose his people over them.

Zeke on the other hand, has no connection to the people on the island. All he saw was the constant struggle and unhappiness between the Eldians and Marleyans, both sides had good people and both sides had bad people (Eren only saw his people as being victims, being good. For the longest time he thought the whole world was inside the walls, and outside the walls were monsters wanting to kill them. Now he knows there's a whole world out there, aaand they want to kill them... In his view, they're the same thing. Monsters outside trying to kill them). Zeke has connection to both Eldians off the island and Marleyans, he empathize with the outside Eldians and the rest of the world. He sees the source of struggle is themselves, himself really. He's accepted he is part of the problem, he's given up, and is willing to sacrifice all his people.

Sorry for the long drawn out response, I really enjoyed discussing and thinking deeply about this. I was really struggling with Eren's decision and thought it was equally as messed up as Zeke's and not wanting to see him go down the path of a bad guy. This discussion lead me to empathize more and more with Eren and understanding the choice he's making, but still not agreeing with it. Someone else posted something in this thread that gave me further insight on how this might end :)

[Mikasa ends up being the one to kill Eren. The last thing Eren sees in the present is Mikasa cutting him down. Cue the first chapter scene where Mikasa is waking up a napping Eren under the tree, and him saying how her hair grew long. Then he says he had a very very long dream but don't remember anything of it, and we see he has tears running down his face and Mikasa asking why he's crying. I hope that Eren knew how he was going to die all along, and that in order to save everybody, he had to play the role of a villain that either unites everyone to fight him, or make the world recognize them and see them as valuable as all other race/nations. After all, he's supposed to have the power to see everything in his future, and it's not his first rodeo being a very convincing liar.](/spoiler)"

I'm very sure this type of shit has been done many times before with characters having ability to see future or some shit, but I can't remember any examples right now, but this one has me overflowing with excitement. Ah, but so sad about it too. If this doesn't happen, ...shit I don't know what I'll do, but I'll think of something and come back with an edit. In the meantime I need to step away a bit and process this shiiiit."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdfotr9,t1_fdfff71,1578366655.0,"I'm glad too. I was pretty confident he was still alive. If he had just died that way... it would seem insulting. Lesser characters got better/more recognized/ confirmation of death. I don't mind him dying though, I just want it to be confirmed and more recognized."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdfokop,t1_fdfhcea,1578366489.0,"Has she ever been this lost in not knowing what to do? So maybe she does have that Ackerman bond thing with Eren. Before, even in highly distressful situations, *especially* in those situations, she seemed very composed, mature, and certain in what to do, like an instinct type of thing. Now, she's like a lost little girl. Maybe that bond is broken."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdfo1dq,t1_fdffqj2,1578366135.0,"Isn't it ending in 2020? That could mean at end of the year haha. But yeah, even then it still doesn't feel like it'd be enough. I just really hope it doesn't get Bleach'ed (rushed at the end)."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdfn9l6,t1_fdfga7i,1578365628.0,"I wouldn't be surprised either way. I think he absolutely hates Zeke after that ambush that killed Erwin. To become the thing he hates to do whatever the hell is right (I don't what's right or wrong now), or to rather die than become the beast. It could go both ways.

Ninja edit: actually wtf happened to Zeke? I forgot and don't see anything after he had came into contact with Eren's head."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdfmvfr,t1_fdfgl0w,1578365369.0,"I didn't believe he was dead because there was confirmation. For someone with such a big role, it'd be pretty messed up for him to just die like nothing. Lesser characters got a better/more recognized death. That's just my opinion."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdfm7gs,t1_fdfixbh,1578364936.0,"I agree that it is less of both evils. However, I wouldn't call it a selfless decision. If anything it was selfish of him to make that decision for all of Eldians, so that *he* could feel comfort. For anyone who wants kids, to happily raise a family, to continue their bloodline, it's like robbing away my future, my dreams, a goal to be happy."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdflqta,t1_fdfklyv,1578364635.0,"But selfish for him to make that decision for all of Eldian race. Doesn't the rest of the Eldians have a right to live on, procreate, be happy raising a family if they want to, keep their bloodline, let their race of people kept alive, like all other race of people? Not saying that what Eren's doing is right. Neither Zeke nor Eren is right. They are only right to themselves and the people who follow them. This is the beauty of how this story has developed. There is no longer good guys or bad guys, everybody see themselves as the good guys (or victims) and they see anyone opposing them are the bad guys (oppressors). Just like the real world."
AskReddit,fdc498y,t1_fdaolee,1578266808.0,"Imagine Reddit has something else people can pay to tell them how shit their post or comment is. Like an ass penny award or something. And instead of the gold/platinum benefits they get something that would inconvenience their Reddit experience for a week per ass penny. Random comments/post would fail to be submitted. Smaller cap on max characters, each post/comment is a random small ass cap. Things like that. To prevent people from abusing it, let's say it would require an X amount of people to contribute to give someone an ass penny within a certain time limit. Example would be like 300 $1 contributions within 3 hours. If it fails to get 300 within that time, everybody's money gets refunded. The person who got the ass penny (or pennies) could pay 1XX% of the cost of the ass penny (pennies) to have them removed. 100% goes back to those who contributed, rest of the XX% goes to Reddit.

Am I insane? Not usually. But right now? Maybe."
