The scale at which the mainline movies are working with means that a lot of heroic/ suicide missions  could happen and be ultimately forgotten as just another part of the war. That’s true for any war really. Think about the second Death Star plans being stolen. The only line we get is from Mon Mothma that says a bunch of Bothans died to get them. That story is probably super important and had a bunch of people die for the rebel alliance, only for their work to be reduced to a single sentence.

I also don’t blame you for calling me out. The world is full of bizarre and strange things that are so crazy as to be unbelievable. If it’s any consolation, the man who first put forth the guillotine as a form of “painless” execution, Joseph Guillotin, massively regretting doing so later as he was a staunch anti death penalty advocate.

Historical records also show that there were several instances of heads emoting in every type of emotion after being decapitated. The most well known would be that of murderer Charlotte Corday, who upon having her face slapped by his face slapped by the executioner appeared to become quite angry before truly dying moments later.

You also probably still feel an incredible amount of pain, despite lacking a body. Phantom Pain syndrome is a very real and documented effect of amputees feeling their missing limbs sometimes years afterwards. Now imagine, your entire body below the neck has just been severed in a fairly violent process. You feel the body and feel an intense amount of pain, but are unable to do anything about it or even express yourself until your brain slowly shuts off from lack of oxygen. 

Other methods of death might be more painful, but being trapped inside your head, going mad as your brain starts to starve for oxygen is definitely up there as exceedingly cruel and unnecessary. I’d rather be shot by a firing squad than be just a head waiting to die."

MovieDetails,fej1fuf,t1_feiov45,1579153453.0,Neither of them stopped him only delayed him. Hell Captain Marvel barely even did that. She got like 30 seconds before Thanos haymakerd her into the DC universe.
videos,fej04lo,t1_feiy51y,1579152215.0,By Reddit pretty much. He had one YouTube video explode overnight because Reddit latched onto it and he started repping his twitch super hard at the same time.
videos,feizzm8,t1_feivo69,1579152088.0,"He was essentially the Wubby of 2 years ago. Made videos all about calling out other shitty YouTubers, made his career off of being edgy, and reddit loved him. He fell out of popularity because he really doesn’t make a lot of content and to stay popular with Reddit, you have to have a constant stream of content. I’m sure once Wubby burns himself out or Youtube collapses, Reddit will find another edgelord to watch."
MovieDetails,feihmix,t1_feiacui,1579138734.0,Would be kinda interesting for a evil Spider-Man to use that motif. Specializes in traps that can somehow ignore the spider sense so he can capture other Spider-people to do various evil things with.

TheOutsider,feena1b,t1_fedxjal,1579037203.0,Fuck you right
TheOutsider,fedkg7x,t1_fe911aq,1579013760.0,Kinda a mix of both. The quality varies wildly by episode.
TheOutsider,fedkclm,t1_feb2mox,1579013692.0,Isn’t that the same description you could use for It though?
TheOutsider,fedjwjk,t1_fec2vm8,1579013386.0,"Same with Life. They get Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllynhaal together and you think they’re gonna be the two action stars of the movie. Nope, Reynolds gets killed like 20 minutes in.

Edit: a name correction"
Cyberpunk,fecktyk,t1_feakd9d,1578976376.0,It’s prolly some lightweight but also somehow super strong alloy that every sci-fi setting seems to have so I wouldn’t worry about the weight.
movies,fecio4a,t1_feamy1u,1578974855.0,I’m pretty sure being broadcast on live news and having a small cult of people follow you cross country counts as being famous.
movies,febhvzb,t1_febdvax,1578958963.0,"She does not have to die actually. She can turn into Spider-Gwen, but that means peter has to die."
TwoXChromosomes,feacppe,t1_feac14h,1578947079.0,"That’s a pretty obvious twisting of stats and is also goes directly against your own argument. If a majority of gun deaths are from suicides (which isn’t a crime in the US btw), why are you so afraid of a criminal with a gun. Statistically, they are more likely to blow their own brains out than yours. 

The only person that an abortion can ever hurt is the person getting it. You can’t weaponize it. So no, guns and abortions are not the same."
TwoXChromosomes,feabz8a,t1_fea7akw,1578946811.0,"It’s almost as if there’s no true 100% guarantee that those methods are effective. The only truly 100% safe way is to have your tubes tied, but doctors refuse that by and large so what option does that leave women? None."
TwoXChromosomes,feabpr7,t1_feab787,1578946720.0,There’s a big difference there bud and you now it. A person getting an abortion only physically hurts themselves. A criminal with a gun will hurt a lot more than themselves.
funny,feabdm7,t1_fea8hnk,1578946598.0,"You have literal video evidence of him spitting in the mans face along with at least a couple people who witnessed it and would confirm it. That’s easily enough proof to convict someone. You don’t need fucking dna evidence if it’s beyond a reasonable doubt. It also wasn’t eleven hits while he was unconscious. It was 3-4 after he had gone noticeably limp. Him falling to the ground isn’t proof that he’s unconscious. 

Murdering requires intent and seeing as how the man stopped punching the unconscious man after realizing he was out, it’s pretty obvious he didn’t intend to kill the man. So no, it’s not attempted murder. It’s battery at worst."
movies,fe6guu5,t1_fe6gtgz,1578890495.0,Trolls gonna troll I guess. Don’t know why I even bothered here.
movies,fe6gmxs,t1_fe6fqto,1578890306.0,"Just writing something out doesn’t make it racist, you weirdo. That’s not how that works. In context it’s pretty clear that I am pointing out that Hollywood movies at and around the era Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom came out had depictions of asian people with buck teeth and greasy hair. Me saying that it was a racial stereotype isn’t racist. That’s some backwards ass logic if I’ve ever heard it."
movies,fe6floe,t1_fe6fgwx,1578889423.0,"Do you not know the meaning of the word context? From the looks of your formatting, I’m just gonna assume your angry drunk and looking for an outlet."

movies,fe6ezwz,t1_fe6e0i3,1578888926.0,I didn’t invent the stereotype dude. It’s been around for decades.
movies,fe6dolr,t1_fe6djbz,1578887869.0,Your arguments really don’t make sense. Pointing out racist stereotypes isn’t racist. The stereotype is racist.
sports,fe5yqbu,t1_fe5xg8o,1578877920.0,Pretty sure it would be a penalty and a fine as 1) the cans would be considered props and 2) the league loves handing out fines over shit like that
nottheonion,fe5ivl4,t1_fe5ho3k,1578870036.0,"He’s also far and away the most powerful character in the show. If he gets even any smarter, he could actually become a genuine threat to the remnant of the Empire instead of just a passive one."
