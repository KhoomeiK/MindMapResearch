Maybe it's just my experience, but there are usually 3-4 narrative threads going on at a time (and sometimes multiple conversations happening, too), and that means multiple aspects could be the one being x-carded.  Do you thereafter avoid anything and everything that was happening at the time, or are they expected to keep touching the card until you figure out what to avoid by process of elimination?

It's a weird linguistic quirk that—like the word 'cuck'—while not itself seemingly political, very reliably identifies people's political leanings.   It's really weird—it's not like the complaint is unique; lots of people on every part of the political spectrum will readily agree that all these 24-hour news channels are hot garbage, but the specific phrasing ""got caught"" seems to be drilled into one political camp as *the* phrase to use, and only against their apparent foes.

Showerthoughts,fdsaj59,t1_fds05o6,1578698141.0,"One would assume the rebellion is cognizant of the fact that stormtroopers wear that armor, and would choose to equip their fighters with weaponry that defeats it.  The fact that anti-imperial insurgents (and dangerous outlaws) pack weapons that can defeat the light body armor of imperial troops isn't a big surprise.

As the other poster mentioned, storytelling and world-building are sometimes at odds, especially in a format as rushed and cramped as a feature film.  While it's true we never see a storm-trooper shrug off shots, that's typical of the medium.  How many fantasy movie henchmen get lightly slashed at with a sword, despite wearing a breastplate that should completely protect them, yet tumble down ""defeated"" anyway? Especially in the seventies and eighties. But there's a difference between criticizing fight choreography, and concluding that plate armor is supposed to be useless.

The fact that they wear the armor should be sufficient to indicate that it *is* armor—as to why it doesn't help them in the fights in the film, there are as mentioned plenty of valid reasons.  Even today soldiers routinely wear armor that isn't rated against the service rifles of other armies. It still potentially protects them from other hazards, and importantly it forces the enemy to *use* those weapons in the first place. I assume something similar is the case in star wars.

Sure, the imperials wear body armor and people who routinely find themselves against the imperials carry weapons that can defeat it.  But that doesn't mean the armor is useless—indeed, given the empire's massive material advantage, anything that drives up the cost of engagement presumably works in their favor."
Pathfinder_RPG,fdr1c8h,t3_emro87,1578678167.0,"Evil *can* include all kinds of personal faults—but, importantly, it does not have to.

It's possible to write an Evil character who is cowardly, selfish, vindictive, and petty.  But it's also possible to write an Evil character who is brave and loyal, idealistic and self-sacrificing.  None of that is incompatible with Evil.  Indeed, such virtues may if anything be *more* suited to an evil character—whereas a Good character would need to weigh their personal convictions against the needs of others, an evil character can be loyal without compromise.

How often do we see the villain making some speech at the end, explaining how their actions are justified in service of something that matters to them?  All the killing and suffering will be worth it for a perfect world, or to bring back their daughter, or whatever their goal is.  The heroes naturally always reject this reasoning and stop him, but it's often there.

The key, then, to making an evil character work with the party, is to make the thing he wants—the ideal he'd be making that speech about—*the same thing the rest of the party wants.*

The easiest way, I think, is to make the Evil player's motivation... the rest of the party. After all, every megalomaniacal evil mastermind, there are a dozen evil henchmen and loyal lieutenants.  Model your evil character after these latter examples, and you'll find a lot less conflict with the rest of the group.

When the cards are down, and the world is on the line; when it's time to make a final choice between their friends and the world, good character may say a tearful farewell as they take the loss for the greater good, but an evil character... an evil character can say ""Fuck that!—I'm saving my friends even if the world has to burn to do it."" 

Anyway, I think that's the only way to play an evil character alongside good ones.  A character who is brave and loyal, who doesn't relish kicking puppies or anything like that, but has a set of people or causes they will stop at nothing to protect. A character who will stand with you, back-to-back against the world, who is noble and self-sacrificing... they just happen to be *other-people-*sacrificing too, when they must, and that's what makes them Evil."

todayilearned,fcwu69a,t1_fcwnpel,1578037762.0,"What people seem to forget is that ""PC"" is *always* an insult.

It's a reference to agents of the Soviet Politburo, who would throw you in the gulag for speaking any anti-authoritarian views. Such views were  ""Politically Incorrect"" even if they weren't factually incorrect.  It might, for example, be politically incorrect to describe a mass starvation as a ""famine"" as that would imply a failure of the government.  The ""politically correct"" reference would be one that glorified or at least did not criticize the soviet body politic—perhaps ""Grain Quota Adjustments"" or something.

At least, that's the reference.

So, when someone in the west calls something ""politically incorrect,"" they are saying that it's an unjustly suppressed truth, likening those who are upset to dogmatic Politburo agents policing free thought.

I find the opposite far more common, to be honest.  There are a few assholes, of course, as you correctly point out, but I think in general that most men freely admit they don't know about vaginal health, bra sizing,  or other things with which they lack experience.  If anything, many even go too far in that direction, and even appear to take a twisted sort of perverse *pride* in their ignorance, as if ability to pick up the right brand of tampons would somehow destroy their precious manly manhood.  

But there are many, many women who will insist that they not only know, but know better than experts and medical professionals, if those experts happen to be male, or just if they're talking to a male—even if their own most advanced education on the subject was seventh grade health class taught by an apathetic gym teacher.

You see it in particular around pregnancy—there is *so* much misinformation gleefully shared by ""helpful"" ladies who will insist they a.) have an inherent right to comment on another couple's reproductive situation and b.) automatically know better than any man about the medical science of reproductive health, by virtue of being women.
