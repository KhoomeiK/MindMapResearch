Imagine trampling over the express wishes of the person you have vowed to honour and care for AND THEN being angry at them for weeks on end for standing up for themselves!

Tell her what you are ready to talk about and ask that she respects that you're still working through what happened.

Talking to a professional probably wouldn't hurt either. You were hurt, betrayed, and manipulated by someone you should have been able to trust. The size of the attacker in this situation does not matter, your ex was supposed to love and care for you, not make your life a living and inescapable hell. There is no shame in that and you are neither stupid, nor weak. Talking about it with a professional and having the support of loved ones who know about your trauma will help you on your healing process. I wish you all the best moving forward!"

I think it could have been handled better and many people make great points about your BF being NTA for asking for a paternity test, BUT I see very few people who are keeping your history of sex being a massive taboo in mind. 

Your ex had every right to want to be certain the child is his, it just makes sense for him to want to be sure with the precautions you took as a couple. However, he knew that he was your first sexual partner, he knew what you were raised to believe about sex, and he STILL asked that immediately after finding out you were pregnant? That's incredibly insensitive and, again, knowing your history, he should have talked to you in a way that didn't sound like an accusation any woman would be upset about. 

Hell, my SO has already told me he would want a paternity test done and we use very little protection. Even knowing that he would want it in advance leaves me a little miffed, but I try to keep in mind that he was cheated on and that is going to effect his choices and reactions. It's one of the responsibilities of being in an adult relationship, you have to understand where these actions and reactions are coming from.

Perhaps it would help if you wrote him a letter explaining how his reaction made you feel and why you reacted the way you did. That could be very helpful for him moving forward and may help you too, OP."

My SO frequently pays a larger portions of the groceries because he eats far more than I do and eats more meat than I do. I appreciate it because he also takes our wage differences into account. 

I still tend to send him more than he asks for because my foods are more expensive since I have food intolerances and need to buy from the over priced section (enter eye roll here.)

Basically, you two need to sit down and discuss money, particularly where spliting the bills involved. My suggestion would be to approach it with more ""I feel ______"" instead of ""you always ___"""

relationship_advice,fcnsge6,t1_fcno57l,1577817548.0,"When I first started dating my SO, he was incredibly insecure about my sexual history vs his own. It lead to waaaayyy too many questions and comments about my history and preferences and eventually I snapped at him with an answer about my body count that was a fake and highly ludacris number. It was said with anger and a huge amount of sarcasm, but all he heard was the number and got very upset. It took the fight over that fake body count for him to take a step back and start to deal with some of his baggage and stop projecting onto me.

My point here is: if OP has a history of this kind of insecurity and questioning, the gf may have had enough and asked that question sarcastically in the hopes that OP would realize he's bringing unnecessary paranoia in to the situation. It's purely speculation, as I don't know OP and the gf, but it definitely reminded me of the early days with my SO."
