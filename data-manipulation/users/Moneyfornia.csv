If it's yours and yours to keep and everyone agrees on it, why is this an issue to try and share your 'happy moment' of winning? I am curious as to the reason? Or are there just individuals different than the giver himself that could turn this moment sour because of their own issues with how they think about money?"

pathofexile,ffesk4r,t3_et7ws8,1579863490.0,"Seems like gibberish. It's most likely a coincidence, but the text resembles ""Tausa Vishni"". Melek Taus is a god that is present in different cultures, it is a supreme god of the Yezidis and a emanation of Vishnu. The form of the god is a peacock formed from 7 rays of rainbow.

If I am not mistaken, the model of the Putrid Cloister boss is the same of the Phantasmagoria boss, a boss which has 3 overlapping curses of different colors, which(if the colors mixed) would form a 7-color venn diagram.

Maybe it is relevant, maybe not, who knows.

EDIT: Since you guys like this speculation, let me go full tinfoil mode by adding a few details that people may enjoy:

* Yezidis celebrate birth of Melek Taus with three days of fasting starting on the first Friday of December
* Melek Taus sat on a cosmic egg to hatch it, from which 7 colors of the rainbow emanated to create the physical universe. From each of the rays, 7 kumaras manifested, each being associated with a different color and being associated with a different day of creation. Melek Taus manifested from color blue and is associated with Friday.  
* Each day of the Three day feast, 14 Qawali (¿Saqawal?) dancers perform a dance in Lalish courtyard around a sacred torch led by a head of the Faqirs."

You cannot base your argument on such a improbable assumption. You have to provide a data set consistent with what you are proposing or a strong reason for believing what you believe.
