funny,ffjifid,t1_ffjb0nf,1579998924.0,"Hey, look, buddy. I'm an engineer. That means I solve problems. Not problems like ""what is beauty,"" because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy.

I solve practical problems. For instance, how am I gonna stop some big mean Mother Hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous new foundation?

The answer?

is a sump pump.

And if that don't work, use more sump pump."
gmu,ffjhvnr,t1_ffj22wy,1579998561.0,"Not sure why you're so down. We're like 20 minutes from D.C.! Take a short metro ride and you can see all the construction going on along the silver line, or perhaps gaze at the capitol building which is under construction, or perhaps walk through the scaffold-lined sidewalks downtown! There's just so much to see and not do!"

He's trying to fathom the fact that he's made it, and that he's trying to keep himself from chasing the next milestone, and that he's had a moment to figure out what his motivations are. He's doing this because it's fun for him, and the moment it stops being fun, he'll stop."

YouShouldKnow,ffhy4kh,t3_eteaso,1579958913.0,"Sounds like BS to me. When I breath out of the mask, the pressure forces the loose flaps of the mask away from my face. When I breath in, those flaps are pulled towards my face, creating a better seal."

functionalprint,ffh19as,t1_ffg0n2d,1579920410.0,"I'll bet it doesn't even need it. I made [this part](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2706198) that holds the canister onto the vacuum, and bears the shear weight of me lifting the whole vacuum up, while the OEM part failed miserably. I can even shake the vacuum around and it still doesn't break.

I can't believe that I made a cheap, crappily designed part out of 3D printed PETG that somehow is stronger than an injection molded, mass produced, properly engineered part."
