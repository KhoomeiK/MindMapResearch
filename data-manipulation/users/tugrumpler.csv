- Overpanel to get enough power in bad conditions that you can live with it. To each their own here.

- Set the installation angle to the winter value or steeper since that optimization is worth the effort.

- Point 1/3 of your panels to the south east, 1/3 due south and 1/3 to the south west to get good direct power throughout the day. (azimuth optimization)

- Use at least 3-times the minimum panels you can live with. Note that cloud conditions cause atmospheric scattering such that inclination and even azimuth are often rendered moot - all panels at all positions produce at similar levels.

The common wisdom though is to install at an angle equal to your latitude as that is roughly the average angle of the sun. Then add 15 degrees in winter and subtract 15 degrees in summer. I’m at 36 degrees so I set my panels at 50 though 60 would not have hurt and would have shed better."

*tank: 3-gallon portable beer cooler: contains circulation pump, has 3 air hose connectors for pump out, pump return, and shower out. Also has water tank temperature display. Loses 2-3 deg per hour depending on temps.

*shower: separate diaphragm demand pump draws from the tank and feeds a permanent shower head in a traditional arrangement, pump is triggered by a waterproof foot switch in the shower and no hot/cold mixing is needed. Shower temp is whatever tank temp is.

*sink shower: added a foot switch to parallel the toggle switch that activates the circulation pump. Added 4’ hose to a shower head over the sink to the pump out connector.

Alternatively there is the Burris fastfire dovetail mount plate for the px4. Amazon has them too but I haven’t tried one yet."

My weather station samples wind direction 20 times a second plus wind speed and plots them on Neopixel rings. It’s idle over 99% of the time."

They’re about 20milliamps at 5v, some usb power packs shut off thinking there’s nothing there.

I buy 5-packs for $16 but they have to be flashed and it’s a pita to do first time."
