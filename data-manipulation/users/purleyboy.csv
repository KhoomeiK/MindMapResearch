Here's another great link on [Should there be professional licensure for Software Engineers](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/invisiblethread/entry/should_there_be_professional_licensure_for_software_engineers?lang=en). The author details an example or where there exists a failure in accountability from his own personal experience:

"" The civil and mechanical engineers did the same for their relevant portions of the system. What always struck me as ironic is that the software portions of these systems were essentially ignored by the permitting authority (in this case, the city where I was working at the time) even though it had as much or more to do with affecting public safety than any other aspect of the system. ""

Obviously this is all opinion. I personally believe in the need for some form of regulated authority similar to real professions.

A good definition of [Profession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession) makes the following case for maturity:

Major milestones which may mark an occupation being identified as a profession include:[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession#cite_note-perks-p2-6)

1. an occupation becomes a full-time occupation
2. the establishment of a [training school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_institution)
3. the establishment of a [university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University) school
4. the establishment of a local [association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association)

Each team has a Quarterly goals and expectations are set with the team on what should be delivered on what schedule.

Then run a spreadsheet and show them, based upon estimated earnings, how long it will take them to pay it off. I want them to really understand what this means for them.

Then I plan on telling them that I will cover 100%, but that's it - undergrad only. If they screw it up, then it's on them. Now they understand the deal, it's on them to make good choices."

agile,fcxfyjr,t3_ej7ksl,1578061925.0,"This is a great article. However, your title made me squirm; my initial reaction was 'that's not going to work', but what you describe is great as you truly delegate and empower individual teams. However, each team still has a leader.

What you describe is approximately what I have seen work successfully, and allows for greater scaling in an Agile environment. In my world I try and scale by teams rather than individuals, and I'll try and keep a team a defined static size. This helps in planning, budgeting, and tracking where open seats are in a large dev shop. Each team is given or more project/product responsibilities and are then empowered to be successful in delivering value on that. Each team has a Quarterly goals and expectations are set with the team on what should be delivered on what schedule.

I've worked in places where there are multiple teams all working on any item, and the teams grow and shrink continuously. It's impossible to manage from above or within the team itself. The historic velocities are meaningless and having oversight on progress with specific products is impossible to fully understand."
agile,fcxf9uq,t1_fcw0zi5,1578061403.0,I particularly see problems if the PO reports into a different part of the organization from the rest of the team. It sets up for internal conflict as one part of the Org defines the 'What' and another is expected to deliver with the 'How'. But without there being a single head on the block higher up in the org there are constant battles around who is responsible if the teams are not delivering.

agile,fcpc82o,t1_fcmozar,1577857944.0,"If I'm paying for something I need to know how it is progressing, whether my customers will get the promised features on time, and (shock horror) how my employees are performing. 
This is normal in Sales, Marketing. Support, Operations, G&A, ... and R&D. It's how you run a company. 
I understand that people don't like to be measured.  But I am measured by my Board of Directors, and your philosophy definitely won't be acceptable to them."
agile,fcmkwpl,t1_fcmkjvy,1577779543.0,"Large scale management requires empirical data to allow for decision making that is acceptable to senior leadership. Self managing teams does not remove a need for external management.

Where are the bottlenecks?

Where does most of the time go?

Are there questionable activities (eg not enough qa)?

Based on historic performance will we meet projected delivery dates?
