My best friend's mom has cancer and apparently she had to be given RBCs during an operation so she didn't bleed out.  Needless to say after she told me that, I made extra sure to be even more prompt on scheduling my donations.

Good on ya for agreeing to donate, many people don't want to be bothered or take the extra time to get hooked up to the machine. (PSA: RBC donations only take a bit longer than whole blood if everything goes smoothly!)"
aww,fd3acc0,t1_fd37ovx,1578156323.0,"That's how I remember! And I say don't apologise for reminding people of things on the internet, since even if they don't need the reminder themselves, someone else who reads it might not know!

But that is actually how I started with her but she kept getting (understandably) frustrated remembering it all, so that's when I found an infographic online for her and printed it off.  I even got some of that paper sticker lamination for it, so it now it sits on her table to look at whenever she needs a reminder!


I keep telling her I didn't learn all this in a day. Also I was taught in 3rd grade, and as I'm 30 now I've clearly had plenty of time to figure things out."

I'm a full time caregiver for my 90 year old grandmother, and right now I'm teaching her chess.  Of course it isn't something she picking up on very quickly, (whoever decided the movement for the knight should be slapped) but that's not the point!  

People forget that the elderly still enjoy new things when taught, it's just that they tend to get frustrated because they don't ""catch on"" as fast as they used to. Or their ""teachers"" get impatient. But with some willingness and patience it is far from impossible to teach an old dog some new tricks.

Srsly people, spend some time with those in their twilight years. You'll both greatly benefit from it.

( Also if anyone is curious, I've found printed infographics work well, along with playing on a tablet.  Once they get over the usual unease of them using new tech, it works amazingly. Since it shows available moves they can make instead of relying on memory)"

ChoosingBeggars,fc2qjy2,t1_fc2jffe,1577371073.0,"Oh man, you aren't kidding about them running hot.  I bought a MacBook Pro for college (art school) back in 2007.  It was my first laptop so I used it like one, you sit it on your lap right?  It took YEARS for the red splotches on my thighs to go away.  I never ""burned"" myself in the traditional sense, as it didn't happen all at once painfully. Noooo it was insidious.... The heat slowly roasted my thighs a little at a time until the top of my thighs looked like I had perpetual sunburn.

Not to mention I had to get a replacement battery since the heat made it expand to the point that the laptop wasn't level anymore.  It worked for what I needed at the time but goddamn I'm STILL hella salty about all that AND the price. It was over 2k. TWO THOUSAND. I could've gotten a (used) car for less than that!  

 Uggh I forgot how much of a grudge I still hold against Apple. Screw those over priced, lowest-common-denominator-user,  uncustomizable pieces of HOT garbage."
LifeProTips,faxfuux,t3_earq2a,1576383294.0,"I like to explain to people when they get frustrated when they fail at something ""easy""....
It's not Easy, it's Simple. Many people conflate the two words, but they don't necessarily mean the same thing.  Something can be ""Easy"" while still being complicated.  Just like something ""Hard"" can be simple.  
Example:
Hitting a fast pitch baseball. The action you are taking isn't complicated, you swing the bat to hit the ball right? Now would you say this action as a whole is easy? No. Because you have to know how to properly stand and swing, while also being aware of the location and speed of the ball coming towards you.  

So Easy isn't always ""Easy"".....although it can become that with enough practice and patience if one is willing."
