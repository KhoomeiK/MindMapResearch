QLED is not an upgrade over OLED. Samsung doesn't make consumer OLED panels but to confuse poorly informed consumers they market their high end LED/LCD TVs as OLEDs. QLED is a Samsung marketing term to describe technology all manufacturer's have in their mid tier tvs. OLED is a type of TV production process that only LG makes currently. It gives deeper black levels than plasmas and recreates an incredibly realistic range of colors. A QLED will not be able to reach the black levels of your plasma but can get much brighter.

Almost no one will say Samsung's top tier is better than OLEDs or Sony's top tier.

 If the TV buying can wait until fall that would really be the best time to future proof.

A cult is founded by an individual a religion is a transition from more primitive beliefs. The stuff that makes Mormons not Christian aren't cultural beliefs and norms that were spread by isolation and different cultural systems, but one man's ideas.

He was likely an amalgamation of preachers who were popular in Jerusalem at that time because of Rome's occupation.

The difference is pretty obvious between a Mormon and a Protestant Christian. One person fabricated Mormonism to serve his own purposes the values and culture of Mormonism don't reflect the society and their holy text is not a traditional belief that became codified. Shunning and service to the church are an intrinsic part of the church.

 Protestant Christianity is slightly older but is an evolution of cultural norms that became codified and reinterpreted once translated. There is no historical person who founded the religion. You can leave and join a different church and your family will still talk to you.

I'm an atheist btw. I can still see how a religion and a cult are different. Not all of what people consider ""religions"" are.

Real religions are usually cultural norms that become doctrines and the doctrines aren't attributed or controlled by one person. Sometimes the doctrines are written down by a group of the followers but if they are written down by an individual it will usually be a short lived cult because the cult will struggle to outlive the individual.

Televisions,fdy5g3n,t3_enbwo4,1578776292.0,"I'm not in Europe so I am not familiar with this specific TV but this is a common question lots of places and the answer is that no tv transmits Bluetooth. Lots of TV's can receive a Bluetooth signal so you can play music on them but none I have seen transmit it. Bluetooth will also sometimes have a delay so voices wouldn't match up on the TV even if it transmitted Bluetooth, which is probably why TVs don't do that.

ChoosingBeggars,fdm6ayj,t1_fdkpfk9,1578540847.0,"If each of your dogs costs as much (8,000) x3 and you pay 200 a month you paid $24,000 over their lifetime to insurance and they will only cover $19,500 of it. In the mean time they had the capital which conservatively increased to $35,000 in a mutual fund. You are still customer A who is throwing ridiculous money at your pet you are just making bad personal finance decisions as well as spending crazy money on your pets.

Solution: create a mutual fund, put $200 in every month. Get a credit card designed for pet health financing, they usually offer so many months of no interest financing. Use that when your pet gets sick and then withdraw whatever you need from the mutual fund to pay it off once you can. You are now $12,000 ahead of where you were with pet insurance.

Televisions,fdm00on,t1_fdkt8ub,1578536570.0,Contact BBY corporate. File a complaint. Selling a TV half price instead of doing an exchange means that store is doing awful and is run by idiots. I previously worked there and refusing would be one thing but halving another TV? Sounds like the sales manager has no idea what that would actually cost since Vizio's are price locked. If it was a half off discount on any other TV call corporate and tell them. They might not fix it for you but they will definitely be telling at that manager.
