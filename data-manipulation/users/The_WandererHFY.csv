After being blessed by the Seraph for the speed and strength boost, Doomguy singlehandedly cut the demon population down by over 90%. He damn-near rendered them *extinct*. It says as much in the Testaments: the only demons left were the ones that deliberately *ran and hid in the dark*.

I fail to see how there *isn't* intent when it was explicitly stated that not doing A, B, C would kill the kid and she chose to refuse ABC and then stop doing D, which was the fever reducing drugs she had been giving, based on the whim of a Facebook Mommy Group.

Even more so when it's *their* child, the one who looked to them and nobody else for protection and love. Not only did you fuck over a child, but they *trusted you to help them*. That kid was *helpless* in their last days as their parent *watched them die.*

No. No, I will not feel any fucking compassion for a child-murderer. They killed an innocent kid with their fucking bullheaded ignorance and sheer inability to be wrong. They don't get to ""feel bad"" about a death they intentionally caused in the name of their batshit-crazy, pants-on-head retarded pseudoscience movement.

Fuck this person wholeheartedly, if they wanted mercy they should have let their child live. Put them in a fucking box and lock them away forever like the monster they are. Child-killers don't get compassion. When you kill something that hasn't even grown up yet, you rob it of almost infinite potential.

If the child is at risk, and this has been stated by a medical professional, under the condition that meds are recommended to save the kids life, the meds should not legally be *able* to be refused. 

TBH, I feel like if you aren't willing to care for the child / won't let the child be cared for, you should have the child temporarily or permanently taken from you, and the child taken care of in your stead, with your parental rights only reinstated once the affair is over. If you refuse vaccination, OK. You are no longer the kid's parent/guardian until the vaccinations are done, unless the kid *cannot get* the vaccine(s) for immune reasons. No more religious exemptions either, if your God demands you forgo medical technology, get the fuck out of our society and go live in the woods like the Luddite you are so you can't carry a disease we can catch.

For example:

Job was a devout follower beyond compare and what did it get him? He was tortured, ostracized, his family was killed and not even resurrected by God, just replaced. Job's kids were dead, his wife was dead, they all went to heaven but still they were killed. Job was also rejected by his friends and neighbors, branded a heretic, stricken with incurable, weeping sores, and his livestock all died.

Job was subjected to crippling pain, physical emotional/mental and social. He has the *audacity* to ask ""Why the fuck did you do this, what did I ever do?"" and God acts like a tempermental douche about it before undoing everything.

His family and friends were *permanently* taken away by God, and the family was replaced with a *new* one with twice as many kids... that weren't his, and a wife that wasn't his. Created by God, since he wasn't willing to give Job's real family back.

So now that it's over, Job is twice as wealthy, his friends don't hate him anymore, he's been healed. But he's alone, the family he loved is gone, the animals he bonded with are gone, and his friends literally turned their backs on him when he needed them most. Job has been fucked over 6 ways to Sunday.

So I don't talk to her about ""me"" anymore."
CasualConversation,fgg57q7,t3_ey21yx,1580754507.0,"Man, this kinda stuff always makes me happy in a vicarious sorta way, but also a little bit sad and envious. I'm glad your kid has a good parent like you. Just wish mine coulda been more like that.

Anecdote:

I had my first girlfriend, *my* mom laughed at me and mocked me relentlessly for weeks, and *her* parents told both of us to never speak to one another again, even going so far as to monitor her texts and emails and threaten me with a restraining order. I don't talk to my mom about relationship stuff anymore, after she laughed at me a good 4 more times.

You seem to be on a track to avoid things like that ever happening. And for that, your kiddo is lucky."

My guy, the shit-talking kids at that age that'd call you ugly, are parasitic pricks that just tear other people down for fun. They're assholes who are dealing with the same hormonal shit that you are, but it's made them asshats. And any adults that rip on you, they're just dicks. Feel free to disregard what they have to say.

As for you potentially tearing *yourself* down, if at all, that's unfortunately pretty normal. Being at that milestone in your life is the biggest piece of shit ever because your brain has that same massive hormone imbalance goin on. It'll get better in the years to come, you just have to survive til then. I know it's not an immediate solution, and sometimes it can get bad, but hang in there on those dark days. 

The only advice I can offer, is that understanding and accepting that what your brain might tell you may not always be the truth, helps things (or it did for me). If your brain starts telling you nasty shit about yourself or others, it can very well lie to you. It's a bitch and a half.

Also, for what it may be worth: I got the same treatment, zero self-esteem, rejection left and right, was treated like an ugly freak. I still feel that way sometimes, even now. But surrounding yourself with people that like *you* instead of *your face* makes all the difference. Sometimes, people just suck. But sometimes, people are also what makes it bearable. You're not alone and ya never will be.

And finally: The glasses suit you, those particular frames go well. You've got that kinda adorkable thing goin on. You'll be fine. If it's something you find yourself wanting, you'll have no issue finding a chick or dude that likes you for who you are and will just find what you look like to be a bonus. Hold out hope, OP. You got this."

A wild animal / game animal that got shot and bled out, or died a slow struggling death, will have had all sorts of stress hormones and shit like that. The meat will be tough and nasty. Not to mention that animal will have been running around doing animal things for its whole life, so the muscle would, I'd think, be denser and tougher by default. There's a reason ""game-y"" is a meat descriptor."

We took him swimming at a public pool once, and he almost drowned. He sunk like a rock straight to the bottom of the pool and couldn't get back to the surface because he just couldn't kick / move fast enough through the water. He was fortunate that he had stupid lung capacity and there was a ladder on the side of the pool.

He didn't go back in the pool after that."
