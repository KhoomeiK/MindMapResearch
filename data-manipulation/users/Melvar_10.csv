Animemes,ffiitan,t1_ffhynif,1579974889.0,"In those instances, everything is pretty much learned in late high school, college, or on the job. Never had to use office in a manner that Google suite couldn't handle when I was in elementary and middle school. Once I hit high school THEN I would maybe need a bit more power and then used the family comouter (we were not rich or well off, we were lower middle class) or I simply use the library/computer lab computers. 

Tech is still readily available for kids, the push for Chromebooks is much more beneficial. Because we have Chromebooks, my school site is getting rid of the Mac lab (which is only used to get to Starfall...) And replacing it with a makersoace/steam lab that includes Kano kits (which contains raspberry pis, so kids get hands on time with Linux), as well as arduino. I never had that opportunity as a kid and rarely touched a computer until high school (I'm only 27, so the computers were definitely there).

I get what you're trying to say, but specializing almost always requires you to go out of your way to either learn the stuff you need for a job, or get training. And since kids have their own devices that leaves schools with the opportunity to explore new avenues of tech. This includes makerspaces, steam labs, esports programs (kids at middle school are building and installing OS, setting up live streams, learning stats and numbers, etc, gaming is only left to a few kids and even they need to put work in elsewhere).

Your original comment was downvoted because IT people have already started seeing the benefits of using chromebooks (not just me, others, who have had more time with those programs than I have). I admit they can be a pain in the ass sometimes, but as I pointed out, the benefits outweigh the cons."

Animemes,ffdwoyx,t1_ffd5fft,1579830797.0,"Many school districts are deploying one to one devices, and Chromebooks for that just nicely. Admin them through Google admin, have Google set up the district with a domain for emails, teachers can push out assignments through Google classroom. If a Chromebook breaks, most are relatively easy and quick to fix. Google also gives school districts unlimited data. So hey, free backups!"

cars,ff8c3uf,t1_ff70tsp,1579672498.0,"Go visit a mazda subreddit. They regularly go over 200k. Their 3rd gen Mazda3 beats out the cars in its class in terms of styling imo... I was shopping between Civic, Corolla, Camry, and Matrix. Mazda wasn't even on my mind, then I saw the 3rd gen mazda3, did some research and decided it was what I wanted. Haven't had it for a year yet, but it's been a solid car. No regrets, and my commute to work can involve some back roads so it is fun to drive those roads.

I know some people who switched to Mazda and have become fans because although at heart (minus the newest gen) they are econoboxes, they still have *some* sportiness to them."

These things cost a fortune, so when I have enough to buy or make one for myself, I'll take it around to marathons to hype people up. Will I get paid? No. Will it bring me recognition? Maybe as the dude with a huge drum, but that's about it. You've made something of yourself! Be proud! I know I'll never get to a position like you have, but as long as your heart is in it, that's all that matters, right?"
