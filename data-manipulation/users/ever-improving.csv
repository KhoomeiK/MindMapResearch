orangetheory,fecm67x,t3_eocwgi,1578977345.0,"Strange because at my studio, it's not even 5 min! I was literally on time, but went to pick up my card 30 sec after people were entering since I didn't want to interrupt the coach's speech, but in front of me they gave spots to people on the waitlist while I was right there and they knew I was in the class!"

OMSCS,fcwt0pv,t3_ej79xs,1578036411.0,"What happens if the waitlists are full? It looks like several waitlists are filled up to capacity and there are no remaining slots on the waitlist. In that case, can we not stand in line for those particular courses?"
omad,fbht1z5,t3_edg2sg,1576881603.0,"I tried it one day, loved how it made me feel, then went into 16:8 and tried to reduce the eating window over a month to ease myself into a hopefully sustainable OMAD pattern. I'd say, try it out once and then ease yourself in if your body agrees. All the best!"
