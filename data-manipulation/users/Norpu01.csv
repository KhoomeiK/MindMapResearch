vaxxhappened,fff7ucy,t1_fff7scw,1579877896.0,Which is why this sub is called “vaxxhappened”
pokemon,fff48yc,t1_fff1m6x,1579875290.0,No because the rival is usually your childhood friend.

Eyebleach,ffcatkf,t3_esu673,1579795429.0,He’s adorable!! He has a moustache. So cute.
cats,ffcaqxn,t3_esu6h7,1579795383.0,"I’m so sorry to read all of that OP. Why can’t he go with you to the new apartment? Can you find a place where Zion is welcome? 

Maybe go to the new place and keep saving up and looking for an apartment where Zion is welcome too? 

I hope it all works out for you. Atleast your neighbour is willing to look after the kitty. Which is atleast something. I hope you can find a good solution soon."
PlanetZoo,ffca1y0,t3_esu85i,1579794950.0,I’m more annoyed with path placing than anything else.
cats,ffc9tge,t3_esu8qe,1579794802.0,"No! That is obviously a cat warmer! 

Gorgeous cat!"
Sims4,ffc9eoy,t3_esu93f,1579794541.0,"Sim supply!! James is just a great builder. I like his tiny homes and his latest micro home. 

Also deligracy. She had good use of colours."
memes,ffc9978,t1_ffc6itt,1579794446.0,Because he was outed for his grooming of underage girls by his last victim Sarah.
memes,ffc972y,t1_ffc6i2f,1579794409.0,You didn’t know? Story about his grooming and pedo behavior broke news and YouTube last month. And this month.

bestoflegaladvice,ff9cmra,t1_ff9a44u,1579709985.0,"I was wondering the same thing. It’s not like OP is keeping the opposum as a pet. He’s just feeding the cats, and the opposum eats the cat food they put out. 

The entire post and thread gave me a good giggle though"
memes,ff8xqi8,t3_esbsa3,1579699489.0,I’m no vegan but that looks very unappealing. It looks disgusting.
StoriesAboutKevin,fejw8sx,t3_egj43j,1579187290.0,Pretty sure India is on the Asian continent though. So she is not wrong.
memes,fejf3jq,t1_fej4gt8,1579171095.0,"Nah, the reason the joker has more nominations is because it is a better movie. Nothing to do with the release date. Marvel movies are entertaining but trash. The Joker was entertaining and a good movie."
curledfeetsies,fej5q95,t3_epfkig,1579157969.0,I want to pet Gus. He looks like such a cute snugglebug. 10/10 would pet
memes,fej5kah,t1_fej4ye5,1579157774.0,"Endgame is way more trash and everyone knows it. It’s just not cool to hate on Marvel because everybody thinks all their movies are the best ever. Even though they are all extremely mediocre. 

The Joker was an incredibly good movie. Even if it was about a comic book villain. The Joker could have been a movie about a person losing touch with reality. It is layered and well thought out. A lot better than the trash Marvel has ever made."
AmItheAsshole,fej5fi3,t3_epfkui,1579157620.0,ESH. You for continuously bringing up his dating life. He clearly has some hang ups and needs to work through them. And your brother is an asshole for calling you and your bf names. And for basically blaming his hang ups on woman.
AmItheAsshole,fej5beo,t1_fej4z5v,1579157489.0,"Welp, we’ve found the Incel."
teefies,fedqga5,t1_feda3zc,1579017666.0,Sounds like a cat thing to do.

Sims4,fecsza7,t1_fecpdy2,1578983431.0,Probably garbage/trash plants.
teefies,fecsha1,t3_eogltc,1578982900.0,I’d fold and give him the snacks. I’ma bad cat parent.
cats,fecs611,t3_eogmr7,1578982565.0,"“Not clear! Not clear! Repeat go back to hiding Toby. You are still at the vet!” 

That look though."
AmItheAsshole,fdndtcc,t3_em8o87,1578583669.0,"NTA like at all. They wished him dead. Just send them a message: “Wish granted, you are all dead to us, please never contact us ever again.” And then block them on everything and get new phonenumbers."
SelfAwarewolves,fdnd7i9,t1_fdnd26q,1578583290.0,The point is: women are constantly revered to as “First Lady” or the likes. They are nameless. They get no name. Which is exactly what happened to Harry in this article. And now this dude is outraged. Which is very ironic
pokemon,fdmq5di,t3_em58qv,1578560291.0,It’s about Pokemon home and Pokemon sleep.
pokemongo,fdjm8nt,t1_fdjkw23,1578477661.0, Not my friends account (I think)

IncelTears,fdgm7yt,t3_elaipk,1578402022.0,Just what kind of logic is this? There is a religion gene now?
CatsAreAssholes,fdgiak3,t3_elah82,1578397969.0,But what a beauty though!
MurderedByWords,fdghsun,t1_fdg710i,1578397384.0,I know. But most of them have a scientific background. Not all of them. But just reducing them to “weather girl” is really patronising. And I was just wondering because I know most of the “weather girls” in my country are scientists.
MurderedByWords,fdg2k4o,t3_el77gg,1578377656.0,Aren’t most weather girls educated? Because making a weather forecast actually requires skills.
PlanetZoo,fdg28m4,t3_el78si,1578377324.0,Can the keeper reach the habitat? Did you unpause the game? Is there a warning in the game of some sort?
pokemon,fde3vvg,t3_ekj02y,1578330604.0,The only thing that could come close to such a thing is a gameshark. A gameshark is a device used for cheating.
AmItheAsshole,fcz6omn,t1_fcyzlqy,1578094763.0,"Have to agree with everything you said. I don’t necessarily want kids either, but I don’t hate them.

TrueOffMyChest,fcz4qmm,t3_eiecrl,1578093632.0,"Well shit. I didn’t know I needed this today. But thanks fam. 

((I just woke up this morning really disappointed I was still alive. Depression  sucks))"
pokemongo,fcy1nys,t3_ejir9q,1578073497.0,Uninstall and reinstall will most likely fix this problem.
Sims4,fcxc7rz,t3_ejfc9r,1578058925.0,It was probably a ghost. Sometimes they haunt you by haunting an object in your household.
brushybrushy,fcxc1b8,t3_ejfcrc,1578058771.0,That is one good clean pupper! 10/10 would pet and give a biscuit

insanepeoplefacebook,fcwtd2u,t3_ejbijd,1578036808.0,"“The other side...” dude, there is no other side. Just the side that the entire reputable scientific community stands by: climate change is real and happening right now."
entitledparents,fcwr4xo,t3_ejbjgu,1578034321.0,Sounds like an extremely toxic person. Glad you came out of that relationship.
pokemon,fcwqm1t,t3_ejbkye,1578033772.0,The first Pokemon movie was centered around mewtwo.
