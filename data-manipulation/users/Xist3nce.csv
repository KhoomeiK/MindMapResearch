You propose a way out and the useless platitudes can matter. No matter what I tell the trees around me that the world owes me nothing, and that I'm not a victim or whatever bs is being pedaled. They won't respond. Money doesn't just appear when you say these things. If something isn't possible within the system as is, you can't make it possible by an attitude. No attitude is going to get me the money to move to a city. No attitude is going to make a vehicle appear in the yard fully paid off, and most of all no attitude changes my situation.

They were having relationship issues or something. So the plane gets some crazy turbulence and people get tossed around, some injured and such. One dude is a hypochondriac with a real heart condition, one was a lady who broke her arm or something, and one was a guy that bonded with main doctor lady a bit earlier. So guy's boyfriend gets doctors after the turbulence and says his head is busted, so he has a concussion and such. They have him rest, and hypochondriac man starts freaking out needing help for his anxiety and such, but gets hand waved off because there's people with head injuries and stuff while he's moaning about it being hard to breath or something. So then Handsome dentist guy helps main brain surgeon lady, and Aussie doctor guy treat people, and all the while they are working up a weird relationship dynamic and issue. Main brain surgeon lady starts getting hot for dentist man, and Aussie doc gets hot for mean stewardess with broken arm. But then concussion guy starts vomiting and is unable to speak and they can't land anytime soon, so they rule his brain's swelling and he has a brain bleed. So they say ok brain surgeon lady is gonna relieve pressure on his brain by drilling a hole in his head and sticking a needle in and sucking out the blood constantly until they land. While they are prepping this, hypochondriac man has basically a heart attack or lung problem I can't remember, long story short CPR had to be done, and brain surgeon lady had to stabilize the needle in the mans brain on a turbulence ridden plane, so one wrong move and he might lose some brainmatter. So she gets Dentist man to help her do this and dentist man and brain surgeon lady tag team this man's brain swelling reduction and steadying the needle. Turns out the needle isn't doing enough, it's too slow and dangerous to keep poking it in his head then taking it out to get rid of the blood, so they get a drink mixing straw and stabilize that in his brain to drain the blood as it pours in. Showwriters set up a fake in which both doctors had a side relationship to consider in the mean time and since they were arguing it was plausible. When they landed they did a shot of the dentist walking up to brain surgeon lady, then off to medical staff, and so brain surgeon lady and aussie doctor are still kinda together and they whethered the storm so to speak."

You're right, almost all of TGs servers aren't LRP, except you know, the one that was the most popular for quite a while. You're also right, I've only played a couple hundred hours as a doctor, and stopped when cobbychems released. I also jumped servers to play medical. Because I agree with the one's who's boots you lick, medbay is boring on TG, but I'd incrementally work to fix it instead of dropping a bomb trying to change the entire gameplay loop in one swing."

I learned the game through TG. I've had some of my favorite rounds during the event hall cacophony, and I've made friends that to this day are trying their best to stick with TG. We all have a stake in this, it's just not all of our pride's are entangled in it. Even if this doesn't destroy a chunk of the playerbase, it will disrupt much of what makes the game fun for many people."
SS13,fdn14gy,t1_fdmyjat,1578574059.0,"Bare? Oh no. People already end up leaving as is if they are in an inconvenient spot to be found, and this is with a cloner. Now someone can be shot dead in medbay and the odds are they won't be revived. This PR is basically saying any doctor that cant revive someone is effectively dead weight. 

Im guessing you've never played on an LRP server, most can't even defib, and are soon expected to bring back people from the brink from worse conditions, more time, more effort, and more rarely competency. Unless they start handing out nurse roles before doctor, this might get bad for the playerbase really fast"

SS13,fdm89a4,t1_fdlymni,1578542250.0,"If they destroy antags as we know them, then it may make the rounds longer. They also seem to want to shed the LRP playerbase, smaller server = longer rounds unless antags kill. So I understand their intentions but being the most popular server they should be a pinnacle of what their playerbase calls for.

Yes the cloner is powerful, but 40+ minute server kick outs just for being in the science department when toxins blows are just too much and players will leave. I think the only way to remove the cloner is to remove many of the most fun antags and that is a problem in and of itself yknow?"
SS13,fdlpl51,t3_elyr39,1578529459.0,"So this is being pushed as something to make the rounds last... longer? From my standpoint, it becomes much harder to get back into a round when you die, so people will eventually just leave when they die since they have even less chance to be revived. This creates a negative feedback loop of more players leaving because of dying, missing round restart timer, or just not wanting to wait 40 minutes and going to another server. This continues until playerbase gets smaller, in which antags can cripple the station faster, which leads to more people dying, leaving, and the shuttle being called because now an antag killing 30% of the station, 70% of which cannot be revived anymore by anyone other than god surgeon that's dead, or botany that's on fire. This can't extend rounds unless they make antags weak."

SS13,fdkjo2p,t1_fdkhzq0,1578505082.0,"Cloning should have been nerfed first, then med adjusted, but cobbychems makes it imperative to use the cloner as much as possible. As a game developer more than a player, I can see where their intent was, but it failed. Instead of reverting the failed changes, and retooling the balancing before giving it another shot, they got really defensive and let their pride be injured, so now it's not about players or balance, it's about ""standing their ground"". 

The optimal choice in this situation is to lean towards what makes it more fun for both sides. Doctors need people to heal, and it has to be important enough that they can't heal themselves via a first aid kit in any department after being almost killed. But also players need a way to survive in the field, but still have consequences to being broken in half. Other servers have figured this out to an extreme extent, but to pull that back to make it more accessible to TGs main audience? Not a hard shift. But humans and their pride got involved with progress."
SS13,fdkhd9k,t1_fdk9bz5,1578503908.0,"No one should have to take 2 or 3 different chems for light damage. TG isn't known for its HRP servers, in a game sense it makes getting healed a hassle for anyone not having a doctor complex. Doctors needed more work, yes, but damaging the entire feel of the game aspect of the game in the process wasn't worth it. Some servers also have lasting traumas, broken bones, and enhancement surgeries. These things give docs more stuff to do, but doesn't make it more viable just to off someone and clone them instead of trying to save them. Medical needs more depth, not more death."
SS13,fdk8cte,t1_fdjz2po,1578498392.0,"You started playing late, chemistry was a crux of the station and could prepare a bunch of healing items and give them to staff and no one would kill themselves with them.

I'm still shitting myself in the plant trying to find a way out of here with one guarding the door. They did their business for a while and I did not notice I had a disease. One sneeze and one of them says ""wait who's Tony bingle?"" 3 of them proceeded to ignore the sneezing plant, while one was trying to figure it out.
