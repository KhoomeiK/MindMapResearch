AskReddit,feg5al1,t3_eoz4zz,1579077583.0,"I do it for a living. Professional musician/entertainer here. I've been doing this stuff for forty+ years. I emcee events. I have officiated at innumerable weddings. I have eulogized and sang at more funerals than I prefer to recall, much less count. 

I love nothing more than having people from the crowd join me onstage to sing, tell a joke or whatever. They are usually amateurs. If they are good I'll give them some latitude and let them sing another song or tell another joke. If they suck I say ""Give it up for Mike!"" Or Sally or whatever, and tactfully move them off the stage to take their seat. Usually, these people have never been on a microphone before. The first thing I whisper in their ear when they get up on stage and I give them the mic is ""Don't be shy. Get on the mic and BROADCAST! Talk loud."" Inevitably, they hear their voice through the speaker and back away off the mic. I lean into their ear and reinforce ""get on the mic!"" 

Helpful hints for public speaking: BROADCAST! Take a deep breath and speak loudly. Even on a mic. At first your voice will sound really loud through the speaker system. It's not. Don't back off the mic. Get closer to the mic. It sounds normal out front for the audience. You ever notice how even with a mic a lot of time you can't hear the speaker? People say ""speak up! We can't hear you."" So, don't be pussy...GET ON THE MIC. Don't be shy. Get close to it. Put your lips right up to it and speak loudly. Own the mic. Don't let the mic own you. Inhabit the space.

THIS. IS. MOST. IMPORTANT. The audience is pulling for you. They are on your side. They automatically have respect for you for having the balls to get up in front of a crowd and do what you are doing, which they most likely don't have the balls to do. The crowd wants you to succeed. They're pulling for you. 

Be conversational. Try to talk to your audience like you would to your friends in your living room, except louder. Lol. And, did I say get on the mic?"
