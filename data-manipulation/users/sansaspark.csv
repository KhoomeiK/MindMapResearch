LosAngeles,ff90yv7,t1_ff8hqog,1579702089.0,"The reported depth was 4.3 miles, which is quite shallow and explains the violence. For the sake of comparison, the 1994 Northridge quake occurred at a depth of 11 miles."
LosAngeles,ff90oui,t1_ff8hu55,1579701871.0,"I’ve lived my whole life in the LA area and that was a nasty jolt, it’s not just you! My adrenaline is still pumping remembering it. Van Nuys-based over here."

LosAngeles,fez4mj9,t1_fewm2ks,1579453804.0,"It was in the high 60s down in the flats yesterday, topping out in the low 70s. Super nice."
ADHD,fesnpxu,t1_ferdy4k,1579367187.0,"That’s awful. No one should ever be put in the position of having to beg for medication from a health professional, much less from their own doctor. 

There is already such shame that comes with having mental illness, the last thing we need is further stigmatization. Shame on HIM."
ADHD,femx3fv,t1_femv0ll,1579271876.0,Sounds like you have a really solid perspective on things. I’m really happy for you that you’ve turned such a giant corner. Only good things await you. :)
ADHD,femujfw,t1_femlxnb,1579269977.0,"That was me. Growing up, I knew my home was weirdly disorganized, messy and unpredictable. But it wasn’t until I got diagnosed and medicated as an adult that I looked back and realized it was that way because my mom clearly had undiagnosed ADHD herself. Bad habits beget bad habits, and you can’t pull yourself out of that way of living when it’s a daily struggle just to function as a human being."
ADHD,femtvsb,t1_femrik5,1579269460.0,"Go on with your bad self! Also, please keep in mind that the amazing clarity, stamina and sense of purpose that the medication is giving you right now does fade over time. I got diagnosed at 33, and for 2 years after starting meds I was utterly unstoppable. Since then my tolerance has gotten much higher. If I could do it over, I’d have used that time to develop better organizational and time management habits while I was still Superwoman."

If you are going to criticize her for being bossy, move on to a different post. If you are going to lament her wardrobe for its lack of pink, you should find somewhere else to apply. We have an “All are Welcome Here” sign in our yard.”

blogsnark,fdkyfq6,t1_fdkqdzr,1578513737.0,True true.
blogsnark,fdjvgh0,t1_fdixk90,1578488823.0,"Regarding AB, this is PURELY speculation, but from all of the hinting in Dooce’s post, I got the impression that the “scamming” was for drugs. Dooce mentions she got AB a doctor and also that she “got her medication.” As a former pill popper I could be reading into that, but I also know a lot of middle-aged women who doctor shop and will hit up their friends’ legitimately prescribed medication supply."
blogsnark,fdjv0mp,t1_fdigpyj,1578488410.0,"Did she actually have sex with the first friend’s husband? Her storytelling makes it sound like she just got overly involved in their friendship following his separation, and blurred the lines or emotional intimacy. Where’s the implication that they slept together?"

Edit: nevermind. Culver City is east of Brentwood.  Not like I’ve lived here for 40 years or anything."
AnimalsBeingBros,fcymt1h,t1_fcyjkj4,1578082953.0,"Just adopted a German shepherd mix and she’s legitimately one of the best dogs I’ve ever met. Obedient, smart, cuddly, playful but incredibly gentle with my kids. The only naughty habit she has is stealing food wrappers out of wastebaskets and eating them in secret."
ADHD,fcnzyo6,t1_fcnx1of,1577821605.0,"They live in a task bar as part of my email program (Thunderbird), so I only see them if I go looking for them. I've just trained myself to check the task list 20 times a day."
ADHD,fcnrzkx,t1_fcnhb74,1577817307.0,"Seriously, thank god for therapists who understand and are sympathetic to how our brains function. Mine likes to remind me that our everyday systems are created by and for the neurotypical person, so just because I have a difficult time with something that everyone else seems to find easy, that doesn't automatically mean that everyone is better at that thing than I am. It's like being left-handed -- there may only be right-handed scissors available, but it doesn't mean that you inherently suck at cutting things."
ADHD,fcnr5ot,t1_fcngy12,1577816877.0,"Well stated. Along those lines, our shitty executive function skills make it almost impossible to perform a series of self-directed tasks (such as, say, researching and writing a paper), but if the steps are laid out clearly and simply ahead of time, it becomes much less of a problem. For instance, I can build the hell out of a piece of IKEA furniture, because I just do what the little guy in the instruction booklet does."
ADHD,fcnp5l1,t1_fcnohi8,1577815780.0,"I kick ass as an office manager, but only because I have computer alerts for every. single. task. From the once-a-year stuff to the mundane tasks I do every day. I literally have an alert that reminds me to change the date on my date stamper when I sit down in the mornings."
ADHD,fcnj0b2,t3_ei5atp,1577812631.0,"I used to work in television and feature film development and holy crap, it seems like EVERYONE in the entertainment industry has ADHD. I never realized it, though, because I hadn't been diagnosed yet, so I just thought they were acting normally. Turns out not so much."
ADHD,fcniifj,t1_fcndi3x,1577812384.0,"I went through something similar last year, got a call from my dad complaining that my mom, who had just started chemo, wasn't following the doctor's orders to get out of bed and go for short walks. I got there and the situation was...much worse than that. She could barely sit upright, her speech was slurred, her urine was bright orange. I went into crisis management mode, tracked down the phone number for her oncologist's practice, got in touch with the on-call doctor, then recruited my dad to help me carry my mom to my car so I could drive us all to the emergency room where they were waiting for us. 

My dad has told me a dozen times since then how grateful he was that I came over that day...meanwhile, I can't look at the pile of dirty dishes on my kitchen counter without hyperventilating."

ADHD,fcnfrro,t1_fcna4ya,1577810805.0,That is true grace under pressure. I hope your little one ended up being okay.
ADHD,fcnfmeo,t1_fcn93cf,1577810723.0,"Yes, this is what I was trying to express! I can only speak for myself, but my brain is so used to dealing with ""crisis mode"" multiple times a day that I've become desensitized to true crisis situations."
LosAngeles,fcbge6i,t1_fcatgqk,1577586538.0,"I stumbled onto this neighborhood earlier this year while seeking out a good toy store for my kids, since Toys R Us has now gone the way of Kaybee’s. Within a few minutes I was trying to figure out a way to move to Montrose — haven’t figured one out, though. 

Tom’s Toys is amazing, by the way."
