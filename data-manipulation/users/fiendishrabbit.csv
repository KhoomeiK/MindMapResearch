In fact, while fptp does leave a clear path to responsibility/accountability the effect of the (inevitably) entrenched political system tends to fuck over the effect entirely.
I'm not exactly sure which of Josep H. Colomers papers you're referring to, but Duvergers research was done in a political system where basicly no proportional system used open lists, and where alternatives to fptp were not very wide spread (like instant runoff voting or Alternative Vote).

Fptp is shit since it increases the barriers of entry to the point where people are constantly voting for ""the lesser evil"", not the people they actually want in charge. It has no advantages over Alternative Vote or IRV, systems that were specificly designed to eliminate the drawbacks of FPTP.

It's not a coincidence that FPTP systems are the ones that have been backsliding the most these last 20 years in terms of how much influence voters actually have over elections. Now there are plenty of other systems that reinforce this trend in the US (Gerrymandering and the increased monopolization of the media being key issues), but the roots lie in the fptp system and how it stifles political renewal."

If 1 in 10 students have a been temporarily suspended it sounds to me like the average ""problem management"" is ""ignore problems and suspend any student that doesn't fit into the mold"".

In my years teaching I've had lots of students. That 10-15% of children have problems adapting (everything from medical to behavioral issues), that's perfectly normal. However, in the last 5 years, out of at least 25 ""problem children"" and at least 300 students my teacher team has had 4 temporary suspensions in total. And 3 of those were from the same student (who in my opinion was a vicious, violent and manipulative sociopath of a grade I've only encountered once in my entire life).

That successrate doesn't come easy though. Sometimes it means you have to work hard as a teacher, lots of late nights, lots of emotionally gruelling work, lots and lots and lots of self-control. And it takes teachers that are educated, empathic and ready to adapt. My school does have a specialist team (supported by the school psychologist) which deals with everything from dyslexia to coming up with solutions to behavioral problems.

Generally problems kids are kids lashing out because of issues at home, or because they're simply not adapted to the ""standard way"" of doing things. It includes everything from being on the autism spectrum to having a really hard time controlling their temper (although I haven't had any with IED, like ""Isabel""), to not being able to handle normal lessonplans because they're too restless or easily distracted. And yes, sometimes problems at school are because their parents allow them to get away with anything.

Key factors in preventing problems include:

1. Being proactive. Noticing problems early before they escalate. A small early adjustment is often far more effective than extensive, but late, efforts. I don't know how many times I've stopped potential bullying situation by taking Bully no.1, the instigator, and subtly splitting him up from Bully no.2, the follower, by changing seatings and then assinging them to different groups, where Bully no.2, is in a group with Potential Victim. By weakening the bond between B1 and B2 , strengthening the bond between B2 and PV and changing the social dynamic in the class, preferably in such a subtle manner that neither B1 or B2 have any room for protests or that they even notice. The only thing B1 notices is that when he tries to bully PV he doesn't get the approval and positive feedback from B2 that he craves... problem solved (for now)\*.
2. Being consistent and working as a team. Teachers need to pool their talents. Sometimes you're the right guy for the problem. Sometimes you're not, then you just have to hope that someone else on the team is the problemsolver.
3. At some point, if subtle adjustments don't work, you need to include the disruptive student in the problemsolving. Generally they're aware of what the problem is, and that it's a problem. They just haven't figured out the solution and frequently not the root cause. 99% of kids want to be good kids, but they haven't figured out how to be. So they engage in behaviors that make them feel important, powerful and in control. Or just lash out. Even if it makes them feel worse afterwards. ""Isabel"" is probably a perfect example of this principle in action. Aware of her own problem and that it is a problem. Not malicious in any way. But without guidance she's not capable of handling it.
4. Being trained in De-escalation. Confronting a problem head on, countering hard with hard, is 75% of the time going to make the problem worse. Tackling kids head-on (""Obey me or else!"" ""Sit down!"" ""Stop this instant!"") means that they'll fight you just because they thing they'll lose prestige and social standing if they don't. And when they're angry that matters a lot more to them than it would 15 minutes later. Social judo, making sure that nobody loses face while de-stressing the situation, will solve so many problems. Sharp corrections only work when the student trusts and respects you. In fact, if you manage to make obeying you a sign of prestige you'll have that class every authoritarian dreams of. I'm not the teacher that can manage that feat even 25% of the time though. I've had collegues that manage that situation in almost every class they have, I wish I was that good.

Overall being a teacher is less about being good at being smart or being able to explain things well, and a lot more about creating the social situation where kids relish the challenge of learning, even when it's tough. And the fucking paperwork. Reason no.1 I quit being a teacher and became a youth recreational leader. So much less paperwork. And a 15% paycut, but so worth it.

They've upgraded guidance systems, range and lethality quite significantly and are about on par with China when it comes to anti-air missile technology (but somewhat behind when it comes to ballistic missiles in terms of capability and reliability).

Basicly this is due to a strategic choice by the iranian military leadership. Basicly they knew that they could never develop an airforce that could challenge whatever US-proxies they would face, but without the use of extensive air power no enemy could challenge Iranian ground forces (not in Iran with its mountainous terrain).
So they decided to focus on missile technology. Both as a way of projecting power (primarily with the Shabab system of ballistic missiles) and as a way of countering an enemy airforce, developing both high altitude, mid-altitude and low-altitide missiles capable of intercepting enemy cruise missiles and aircraft. During the last decade they've unveiled a 3rd generation of upgraded missiles in their Shahin and Sayyad-3 missiles, along with several improved launch systems.

The big question mark is how advanced their radar systems are (both in terms of technology but also in terms of tactics). Radar is generally very high-tech business, but during the last 10 years Iran have unveiled a number of different radar systems. Both redesigns of their old Hawk PAR&HPIR radars (Two different radars that are used for acquisition and illumination respectively) that have been updated with better ECCM capability (the PAR radar is moderatly up-hotted, the HPIR radar is a mix of some 90s technology and some state of the art anti-jamming/stealth features), a few integral radars for their various missile systems (one for their russian missiles, one for their crotale systems etc) and a couple of new radar systems that I don't know much about (Ghamar, Alim, Falaq, Mesbah AD and a few more) but which look like they're designed from the ground up.

It's telling though that they're basicly no longer using any foreign manufactured radars. They're all either radars developed by themselves or locally made upgrades.

Just looking at their technological capability they probably have the ability to detect&engage both stealthed targets (like the F-22) and cruise missiles as well as at least the technical capability of using modern countermeasures to anti-radar tactics&weapons (such as coordinated radar arrays, switched illumination tactics etc). Wether they'll do it in practice is...who knows. Depends on the competency of their training programs.

TL;DR: There are two nations in the middle-east that have the technical knowhow to produce advanced military technology. Israel and Iran."

* 200 launchers using hawk missiles
* 300+ launchers using Shanin missiles (Iranian upgrade of the hawk missile)
* Some 100 launchers using Rapiers and S-300 variants.
* Another 100-200 launchers using Taer (iranian upgrades of S-300 missiles).
* Some 600+ launchers using Sayyad missiles. They're based on the US RIM66 missile, but it has gone through 50 years of native iranian upgrades.
* 400+ launchers using Iranian versions of the Crotale missile.
* Another 400+ launchers that can launch either Sayyad or Taer missiles.
* Unknown number of Iranian upgrades of chinese Igla clones. These can be discounted though since the Ukrainian flight would have been too high up for these to be effective.

history,fdngiar,t3_em55al,1578585312.0,"There are several reasons, and lets take a deep dive into the hows and whys.

The first reason is that many fish species generally relied on for food have been overfished and drasticly reduced in numbers:

* Salmon has faced a double threat. Many of the richest salmon rivers have been dammed up for hydropower, and not enough attention paid to making sure that the salmon could swim up the river to spawn. Pacific salmon has been reduced by 90% over the last century, and european salmon faced a similar reduction.
* Cod, once a staple food for western europe, has had its supply halved since the 1960s.
* Herring, once so plentiful that the danish king was one of the wealthiest kings in Europe due to the herring tax, has only recently recovered to 1950s level...but at the same time human population has increased by 33% in Europe and almost trippled globally.
* Tuna fishing has reached maximum level of exploitation for all species, and the bluefin tuna is under threat of extinction.

In addition human income has increased while income from fishing barely has kept pace with the levels of investment needed to be a successful commercial fisher these days. At the same time fishing has decreased at about the same pace as agriculture as an occupation (from ""very percentages of the population"" to very small numbers. Still, 200 million people world wide make their living from fishing. To compensate (somewhat) fishfarming has become more and more common.

And now, lets talk about farming. Producing meat is usually mostly about Feed Conversion Ratio. The conversion ratio for Fish...is usually between 1.2-1.5. 1.2 kilos of feed becomes 1 kilo of fish. At the same time fish farming is problematic in that most fish used for food are predators. Their feed is more expensive, today consisting of a 30/70 meat/plant mix.

Chicken has a FCR of about 1.6 today, a mere 25% of what it was 100 years ago, partially due to more energy rich food but partially due to chickens being bred to put on weight more easily (it takes about a third of the time to grow a 5 pound broiled today than it used to in the mid 19th century). At the same time soybeans and other agricultural products used in chickenfeed has dropped quite drasticly in price.

So with chickens being well suited to cheap feed and with a FCR that's one of the best in the world (today). Of course it's the poor mans food of choice today!

Pigs have a worse FCR (around 3.8 at the time they reach slaughter weight), a FCR that has been improved over the years but not by much, but they have a very high ratio from carcass to dressed meat. And pigs have always been food for both the poor and the rich, although ""ye old pig"" probably tasted more like wild boar than the modern pig does due to its feeding habits (much higher in nuts from oak and beech, food scraps and slaughter-waste, much lower in soybeans and grain. This because pigs used to be herded into the forests to eat, not fed in their pig-pen).  


TL;DR: Overfishing reducing supply and fishing efficiency has not kept pace with the wage development means that fish is more expensive and less plentiful than it used to be. Faster growing chickens and cheaper pig/chicken feed means that pigs and chicken-farming have become exponentially more effective than they used to be. Ergo, fish is relatively more expensive. Chicken and pork is cheaper."

So while according to the Torah an orthodox woman has to have her husband present her a ""get"" for her to be able to remarry (considerably restricting her rights compared to an ordinary divorce), many jewish communities are not above ""encouraging"" (read: intimidating) a husband to give it to her.

AFAIK it's only done as a last resort (and after mediation has failed), because the alternative (a petty husband holding his wife hostage, with her only choices either living alone for the rest of her life or leaving the orthodox community) is worse.

Samtidigt så...nej. Det behövs bättre teknik för att lagra energi eller på annat sätt effektivt använda överskottsenergi för att sol och vind ska kunna vara något mer än en dellösning för Sveriges framtida energibehov.

Samtidigt så har vi, till skillnad från Italien, Turkiet eller Island, inte någon jättepotential för geotermisk energi. Till en viss del kan geotermisk energi användas för att generera värme, men att borra till de djupen som behövs för att generera el är (så vitt jag vet) inte funkis inom den förutsägbara framtiden.
