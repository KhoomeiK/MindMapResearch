depression,fed40ij,t3_eofgj0,1578997715.0,I know how you feel dude... like it's exhausting having to deal with it day in and out. But being at that point where one small action could end it... it isn't peaceful. I was terrified when I attempted. Of course it failed considering... well I'm leaving a comment but the way I see things... I've come this far? Might as well keep going. Just hang in there for now buddy.
depression,fec026o,t1_feby426,1578964786.0,Thank you dude :) ... I think that spared me some more time.
depression,fe9yb6c,t3_eo55m9,1578942557.0,"I mean I attempted it. Pretty scary once you get there knowing one slight action can end it. Not only that, if you do attempt you're likely to be monitored which sucks. And on top of that you will probably get told you're selfish or have that one annoying person constantly use it against you."

depression,fdggtli,t1_fdgg9g7,1578396164.0,I feel like a note is important... Although I regret it.... I may still leave something behind.
depression,fdgex7e,t1_fdgesrd,1578393599.0,Yeah aha weird right? I suppose I just got bored on the walk... at least now I put myself on 'Ghost mode' so no one will find me. Besides if I ever did get the opportunity again I would just leave it at home.
