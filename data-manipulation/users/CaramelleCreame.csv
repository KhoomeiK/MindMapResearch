politics,ff9qx9y,t1_ff9mdpf,1579719063.0,Personally I'm a Sanders supporter but I'd vote for any democrat that is somewhat pro-gun. Literally the only thing I need is for them to come out in favor of gun rights and ignore that issue altogether in favor of medicare for all. Sanders has said before that he considers gun buybacks unconstitutional ( [https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/nov/11/bernie-sanders-slams-mandatory-gun-buybacks-as-unc/](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/nov/11/bernie-sanders-slams-mandatory-gun-buybacks-as-unc/) ) which is what makes me think he is a viable choice.

I think it is more likely that they are just raising prices until it gets to a point where people refuse to pay them. They realize this is something where traditional supply/demand doesn't apply and they are taking advantage of that. This is us letting them fuck us, at the cost of American lives.
