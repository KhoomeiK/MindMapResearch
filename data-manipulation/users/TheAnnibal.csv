One is basically reduced to just domestic flights (Linate), and the big, international and trans-continental flights one (Malpensa) is actually in another province (Varese)... a whopping 40ish Km from the city center itself. It's in another province, and it's less than 30 mins away by train from two of the biggest cities, Milan and Turin.
