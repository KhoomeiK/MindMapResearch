relationship_advice,fdp7rdt,t1_fdp7fxi,1578621977.0,You’re right. I’m just so sick and used to people coming to this sub to shit on their so and seek validation that I’m always skeptical of posts like this. But yes if op is being entirely transparent then this guy is trash.
relationship_advice,fdp4h2j,t1_fdp3i13,1578619780.0,No need to be passive aggressive. Obviously I didn’t see that comment. I still say op is intentionally trying to make this guy look like a pos for validation. Par for the course here
relationship_advice,fdp22rj,t1_fdp1x3g,1578618153.0,It seems like op is intentionally trying to make this guy look like a piece of shit. But if this is true yea it’s a bit disturbing.
relationship_advice,fdp023b,t1_fdozz0m,1578616802.0,So he made a bad joke. You’ve never made a bad joke or said something inappropriate ever once in your life?
relationship_advice,fdozlqb,t1_fdozi5e,1578616500.0,He doesn’t like cats and he hunts. That doesn’t make him a psychopath. This sub is legit the worst place to come to for advice.
relationship_advice,fdoywza,t1_fdnwumb,1578616052.0,Holy shit you are overreacting. My god
relationship_advice,fdl772z,t1_fdl4of8,1578518207.0,Nothing you can do about that. Cut off all communication and tell yourself you have no choice but to move on.
relationship_advice,fdl2y97,t3_elyiov,1578516159.0,"Well, why’d you dump her?"
relationship_advice,fdl2btq,t1_fdl29db,1578515854.0,Then just keep trying. It’s just nervousness and eventually it will go away.
relationship_advice,fdl24k7,t3_elyf3t,1578515746.0,Afraid to tell your family? Can I assume this post is a joke...
relationship_advice,fdkzujo,t3_ely3wg,1578514539.0,"You cannot make this feeling go away. All you can do is change how you respond to it. Whenever I’m feeling insecure, I speak with my sister and she helps calm me down. This way I don’t upset my SO. Is there anyone you’re close with that you can vent to and get feedback from when you’re feeling like this?"
relationship_advice,fdkzdc1,t3_ely2dg,1578514288.0,I’ve always felt harshly about this but if you gain a lot of weight while you’re in a relationship you are being extremely extremely disrespectful to your partner.
relationship_advice,fdkya5u,t3_elxwk0,1578513646.0,No. Absolutely not.
explainlikeimfive,fd43ltq,t1_fd3lm69,1578164087.0,That almost impossible to execute jolt to wake yourself.
bipolar,fd3jvw0,t1_fd34g9d,1578159015.0,I hate when that happens. It’s horrible
bipolar,fczjlxz,t3_ejoijn,1578102667.0,Every time.
bipolar,fczct12,t3_ejodcs,1578098341.0,Bipolar + alcohol = bad news
bipolar,fczcmzn,t3_ejeesb,1578098243.0,I literally convinced myself I was a potential serial killer during my first episode so yes
relationship_advice,fcz8m25,t1_fcyroha,1578095874.0,You just got into a fight with my sister. Small world.
relationship_advice,fcvqx5l,t1_fcvqj9s,1578008083.0,Then I guess you need to attempt to look into the future. Do you think this will change? Do you think these issues will be resolved? Be honest with yourself. I doubt he’s not attracted to you but you can be attracted to your women and still have issues in bed.
relationship_advice,fcvq139,t1_fcvpll7,1578007511.0,"First of all he needs to stop masturbating. Permanently. If he cares about you and your relationship then he will do so. He’s not cumming from PIV because he’s masturbating too damn much. 

The other cause of not cumming from PIV is he’s simply not turned on enough. Do you guys have lots of foreplay? Do you tease him a bit? Have you guys tried role play if you’re into it?

Ultimately you need to decide how much not having sex bothers you. If he can’t give this to you, it might be time to move on."
relationship_advice,fcvp7mv,t1_fcvoies,1578006989.0,"To be honest I think he just using those an excuse to avoid sex because he’s embarrassed of the performance anxiety issues. Any ordinary guy will become heavily turned on when in an intimate situation with his women and will want sex badly. Do you guys try to be intimate?

This anxiety in bed will only go away if you guys keep trying. 

Masturbating together.. idk if that’s something you should continue. That might reinforce his anxiety to a point that it will become difficult to return from."
relationship_advice,fcvo446,t3_ej5pxg,1578006298.0,"Unfortunately it’s not your duty to stay in this relationship out of pity. He needs to be alone and figure some things out. If you’re about to cheat on him just break up with him first. 

As for the sex problems, that has to be tackled head on. You need to make it clear to him that it doesn’t bother you and you guys need to keep trying. The performance anxiety will disappear eventually (I’ve been there more than once)."
relationship_advice,fcv7uxj,t1_fcurvxw,1577996464.0,"I just want to tell you that you need to forgive yourself. People in this subreddit are always on their high horse judging the shit out of everyone else as if they’ve never made a mistake in their life. It’s pretty fucking annoying and a lot of their advice isn’t actual advice but rather judgement disguised as advice. 

All that matters is your husband’s reaction. Tell him what happened and see where it goes from there and stop reading the useless comments in this thread. Good luck."
