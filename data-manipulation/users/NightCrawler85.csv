Maybe you can teach the dog to stand on his back legs for a few seconds while you attatch it?

Also you can buy a lot of additional gear like cooling vests that works with the harnesses which is awesome!"
dogs,ffb2u37,t3_esmjxc,1579750375.0,"I spent about six months looking for the right shelter to adopt from.

Between how strict some of the rescues are (no yard? No one to be home all the time? Not owned a dog before? You have cats?) I got really tempted to just find a breeder.

By coincidence I learned about a shelter in Thailand, and I spent even more time checking them out, watching documentaries and videos where they had been mentioned, articles, blogs, adoption stories. I eventually looked at their dogs and one of them checked every box I wanted.

Male, about a year old, a bit on the larger side and was described as very affectionate and friendly.

With my husbands blessing I sent in an application, which got an answer the next day. The boy I had been looking at already had other people interested in him, but it started the process of Skype interview and the rescue carefully working with us to find the dog that would fit for our family.

After a week or two we had it down to two dogs, and knowing that one already had a wonderful couple in Canada wanting to adopt him if we said no probably played into our decision.

So we ended up adopting a sweet, medium sized bridle girl that wouldn't even be a year by the time she would arrive in California. Sadly the original flight volunteer had to cancel, so we had to wait a while longer before she arrived. May 9th, her 1 year birthday!

She is nothing like what I had expected, or dreamed of, or planned, but she is perfect."

TooAfraidToAsk,fezm1he,t3_eqztl3,1579458854.0,"Pay attention to her ques, facial expressions, sound, her adjusting.

Ask questions, preferably before. Such as what she likes, dislikes, sensitive areas to avoid, areas she likes.

Foreplay, mix it up. Play, have fun, explore together. And don't over think it!

Also remember that every person is different, male or female. What works well with one girl might be a complete turn off for another. There is no text book answer to your question and you just have to communicate and take your time. It can take weeks or months before people are fully comfortable telling the others about their kinks and fantasies so just be patient with each other, and no matter how weird you find a kink do not make fun of the person. If your up for it give it a try, if it's a big no just be honest and tell them that your not comfortable with it."

dogs,fcldckz,t3_eho07v,1577745183.0,"At one point in my life I was really struggling. Having just moved to a new country, no friends, no family no idea what I was supposed to do with my life... I did not do well.

By coincidence I walked into a petstore just to look around, and they happened to have cat adoptions going. Long story short, a couple of days later we brought home a cat and I can honestly say that cat probably helped save both my mental health and marriage. It's been nine years since I brought her home and out of all our pets I don't share the same bond with any of them.

Do I think a dog would have helped as much? No.
I love our dog, and I would not give her up for anything. She often makes me laugh when I'm feeling down and she has been great for my social life. But then there are days where I dread having to get up early to walk her before work, or I'm feeling sick and just don't have the energy. I think if I was in a weaker spot mentally and alone there are days where she would not get the amount of attention that she needs and deserves and I in turn would feel guilty and pressured and maybe even resentment. It would not have been good for me, and certainly not fair for her."

I would recommend a kitten just to make it easier, giving the cat a chance to grow up around the dog and be less likely to already act with hostility towards a dog."
