techsupportgore,ffkvfx0,t1_ffitjdz,1580029707.0,"Yeah, bit \#57 is a lazy af. 

But as others have said, aside from a physical problem, it could be due to the physical design overstepping its timing budget for that bit at that bus speed. Or in layman's terms the ""cable"" to that specific pin is so long that the signal arrives after the state of the input pin has been tranferred into the memory cell. Or in eli5 terms, ""Bit \#57 has arrived late to the party and missed the group photo, every friggin' time""

If lowering the bus speed or increasing the voltage within a safe limit doesn't fix it, the RAM is probably bad."

That's a stupid argument, you'd have to scan an actual print or have the right profile for your scanner-film combination or create one. Or you could adjust that in Lr or Ps. 

But not taking any of this into account and saying, ""That's what film looks like"", disregarding that the scanning altered the picture is just wrong.


I'm fine with you saying, ""That's how I like it"" or ""I want it to look like this"", in the end it's your picture. But the argument that a bad scan of film is how unedited film looks is just stupid."
