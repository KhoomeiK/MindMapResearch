Would you rather have mentally healthy fat people who are trying to lose weight? or mentally unhealthy fat people trying to lose weight? One of them can succeed in weight loss and keep it off. The other is much more likely to slip into their old ways and get even worse than before. Being told to ""eat a salad"" for the millionth time doesnt make me more likely to want to lose weight. The person would just come off as a dick.

cringepics,ffdbqfm,t1_ffd9myy,1579817472.0,"You are assuming fat people in this movement think they are perfect. That is not close to the average case. Fat people know they are fat and that people dont like it. Being told that they are obese and killing themselves over and over and over tends to make a person depressed. Depression also tends to hinder any efforts of weight loss as science shows.

I am glad you were able to motivate yourself to make those changes needed to lose weight. You are not the average case. Not even close. Losing weight is a long journey and keeping it off is a lifetime responsibility. What was your target weight and starting weight if you dont mind me asking. The first 10 pounds are easy for me personally. The rest was, and kinda still is, a lot of effort and restraint on my part. I also slip up and eat bad foods once in a while.

 If I were in my old mindset, I would have just given up because obviously I cant do it. I must suck at losing weight because I cant stop. Thats the mentality that gets promoted from fat shaming. It wasnt untill I started to forgive myself that I was able to say I can do better. I have lost 12 pounds so far again and am optimistic about keeping it off when I hit my goal weight this time. Last time I hit it, I was there for about 6 months before something shitty happened and I ended up depressed and started to overeat again.

I will love you no matter what you decide. I do believe making this decision to lose weight will be good for you though. And I will still love you if you decide not to""

physical beauty is one aspect of their own self esteem. Its not about making them beautiful. Its about making them see that they are worth the care that helps them. Thats the science of psychology saying that. That is why its more than just calories in and calories out. Its changing the brain of a person to be able to say no to mcdonalds more and more. Shaming shows to make that necessary change harder.

&#x200B;

 The average fat person isnt eating 5 big macs a day though. They just order  at mcdonalds more often than two to three times a week like a more average person would. They eat maybe a small bag of chips or two more than you on a daily average. That is why they are overwreight. The person you described is a fat straw man and not the average obese person. 

&#x200B;

 Its a long difficult battle because its exactly like trying to beat addiction to drugs, alcohol, nicotine, and others. It uses the same neural pathways of reward and pleasure as other addictions. That is why I akin it to drugs and alcohol. Shaming people for using drugs and alcohol also doesnt work as well as treating them with compassion and understanding. Its why people who go to jail for drugs relapse so often."
cringepics,ffd1rp8,t1_ffd049m,1579811714.0,"Maybe Im trying to compare apples to oranges then. Considering alcoholic symptoms are more subtle than obesity. I think I can accept that smokers and alcoholics are not accepted well. Or at least looked down upon. I thought you were dismissing the problems of obese people because drinkers and smokers dont get a pass. My mistake.

&#x200B;

Do you think the concept of shaming for any kind of addiction helps the user quit? Im personally of the belief that it hurts more than it helps as you can tell."
cringepics,ffd184m,t1_ffcz3du,1579811410.0,"one person does not a statistic make. Since you are not reading the link I gave, [here](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/magazine/magazine_article/the-scarlet-f/) is another one from Harvard saying it hurts more than it helps. Some people can be motivated by shame. They are the anomalies. The phrase ""big is beutiful"" is not ""big is healthy"". One is to reasure people that being fat does not mean they are less worthy of respect or love. Being supportive of someone makes it more likely they will be able to lose weight. Its more than just calories in and out. I know. Ive been on the scale for some time. Went from 300 to 200. Got bad depression and went back up to 260. Only in the past month have I been able to tell myself I am worth the effort of trying again to lose weight. People telling me to eat a salad or ask if I really need that hamburger just made me feel shitty and hate myself. Eating was a coping mechanism. I still struggle with overeating because food addiction is a real thing that needs to be treated as if it were an addiction and not something that can be turned on and off. Removing the stigma of being fat will help with that. If you want people to lose weight and keep it off, science says compassion and support are the best way. Not calling someone Tubby. 

You would choose that, sure. Most people wont because it doesnt work most of the time and makes it worse more times than not. Im betting that redditor would have lost weight a lot sooner and will keep it off longer if she were told that being fat doesnt make her unattractive."
cringepics,ffczsjg,t1_ffcyfvg,1579810617.0,"Eh, its still more accepting to be a heavy drinker than being fat. Alcoholics can go to bars/clubs and get shitfaced and no one is really aware they have a problem. So no one really shames them unless they are being obnoxious.

Have you been overweight? if so, how much? if you lost it, how long did it take? how hard was it? did you have to make it extreme or was it sustainable? Do you still struggle having to fight the urge to buy the large fries? Do you avoid foods at all cost because they cause you to crave them at the sight? Do you have family or friends who are fat? do you shame them? 

 Shaming has been proven to not only not help, but activley make it worse as  [this](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/fat-shaming-makes-things-worse#other-harmful-effects) article explains.

Meds might also not be the right answer for your sister. She might benefit from therapy instead. I tried that first and it helped me at least understand what causes my feelings better. 

My point is that people will decide to not try drugs because they think they will kill themselves. I think its a terrible side effect of trial and error.
