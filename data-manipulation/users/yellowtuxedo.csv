Bruins,feu2s1w,t1_fetzix8,1579382584.0,Petition to start a metal band that only sings songs about Tuukka Rask but we don’t post the lyrics anywhere so we’re the only ones who know.
Bruins,fetvq1z,t3_eqb2ml,1579380559.0,Thanks for posting. My girl and I were about 8 rows back in Loge 2 and I’ve been hoping a photo would show up where I can see where we were sitting and this is it. Cheers dude.
playstation,fen0zj4,t1_fen08nl,1579274541.0,"Personally, I’ve been playing since the start of the franchise and only got burned out around Revelations/Brotherhood. I skipped on AC:III and found my love for it again with the next gen release of Black Flag. Enjoyed the system upheaval with Origins and currently playing through Odyssey but finding it just slightly less engaging than Origins was. (Mostly find the city structure is often cluttered and a headache to traverse, esp on a horse) and all of the side missions are becoming mind-numbingly similar. “So you want me to kill _____. I’m on it.” Not sure I love the Mercenary system either as they often show up in troves and tag team you and I hate running from a fight. I much prefer the nemesis system in Shadow of Mordor/SoW and think something more like it would have lent some purpose to the whole notion. Overall, enjoying it but not in love yet. Kassandra is the shit though, I love her snarky godlessness."
