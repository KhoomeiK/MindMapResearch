TransportFever2,fevh0oj,t3_eqlyxn,1579397316.0,"Since the game came out I have logged 240 hours. I keep learning things, but what I have learned the most is *everything affects everything.*

If you boost transport inside your cities to your stations you better be ready to fix your rail problems. If you drop more people than your trams can handle in a city you will have to fix that. Trucks delivering to cities cause congestion...

There is a lot going on under the hood here.

And everything costs money.

One tip I can give you even though it is not a long term money maker; taking a raw resource like rocks to a brick factory can be very lucrative in the beginning, but if you don't have a shipping line to a city that wants bricks that will start to dry out as there is no demand.

I have started games in 1990 with tractor trailers and highways work well for them, but they soon get congested and I have to admit I got frustrated and went back to 1850, but if I had the money to relieve the highway congestion it may have worked out better.
