EDAnonymous,fffpyds,t3_et9osr,1579889263.0,"I think fasting doesn't count as an ed as long as the person doing it goes back to eating healthy after the fast, and doesn't fast until they're underweight. Things like that. Now me on the other hand, when I fast it's definitely part of my ed because of my mentality and the fact that after the fast I'll immediately go to extreme restriction or binging. So yeah, whether or not fasting is disordered behavior really depends on the person I suppose."
