And trust me I know that lol thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m researching and looking for opinions. Iâ€™ll wait if itâ€™s the best option, but I want to consider all of them."

Anxiety,fee7157,t3_eojtrm,1579027717.0,"I used to struggle with this in real life. Still do on occasion. I was afraid to do/say anything because I didnâ€™t want to be judged. What I didnâ€™t realize is that no one was paying attention to me.  Literally, nobody gave a single shit if I tripped over my own two feet. And even if they do notice, people never pay attention to anything very long. The worst thing that can happen is you missing out on life and others missing out on your amazing self."
Anxiety,fedc2zx,t1_febzyfg,1579007195.0,Yeah Iâ€™m hearing a lot of people with a similar experience and itâ€™s really encouraging. Definitely a fashion design major. Itâ€™s my passion.

Showerthoughts,fdqyqpx,t1_fdqxwc2,1578676935.0,"True, but originally I was referring to make believe monsters."
Showerthoughts,fdqxo40,t1_fdqv7e2,1578676283.0,Not necessarily. Kids check under their beds at night for fantasy creatures. When Iâ€™m on my night runs Iâ€™m always checking dark corners and avoiding low-lit streets.
