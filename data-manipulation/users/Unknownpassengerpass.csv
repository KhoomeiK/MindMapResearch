I can’t cope and I still don’t think ending it is doable...so I really don’t what to do"
depression,fdieqw5,t1_fdgnevy,1578441244.0,"I hold everyone to some standards but I hate only myself for not meeting them...for everyone else I’m fine with it.  

Don’t bother I can’t understand myself."
SuicideWatch,fd9lujb,t1_fd91zl5,1578235123.0,"I hope the opposite. 

 I do want that people understand suicide, but only after it happens. Before that everyone should do everything within range to stop it."
SuicideWatch,fd1pam1,t1_fcz0dgz,1578134692.0,"I understand. 
Sounds like a really complicated situation and chances of you guys meeting are a bit unclear. 
But luckily in just few years you won’t have to bring your brother with you."
SuicideWatch,fcttvhw,t1_fcn85b6,1577959260.0,Does she have to know about it though? Can’t you see him without her knowing?
depression,fcsrm25,t3_eikclj,1577923345.0,"I felt your words, on a really deep level. It made me feel bad for you and realize few things about myself too...sorry for your lost, and bless your heart."
SuicideWatch,fcmp2nr,t1_fcmncxv,1577785177.0,"I understand why you’re feeling like this, but, look, people don’t leave or cheat on each other for more better looking people everywhere, there are men and women who do but in general these men and women wouldn’t commit to an online relationship like yours did. 
Keep in mind that if he wanted his better looking friend, he would have been with her before the online relationship. 
Besides, there are good chances she’s not interested in him and has a boyfriend. 

Please go meet him and get yourself out of this stressful situation"
SuicideWatch,fckrgh2,t3_ehndfw,1577731592.0,"If X shoots someone, they would die if their brain isn’t receiving blood because of bleeding induced by the shot. X is a murderer.  
If X bullies someone, they would die if their brain isn’t receiving chemicals enough because of the bullying (it would decide to shut down itself even if there is enough blood). X is a murderer.

What I’m trying to say here is that suicide at some point isn’t a choice, and it really is the direct consequence of something environmental...Let’s look at extreme situations : imagine if Y discovers something to protect vital organs of fire (like a special tissu layer), and uses it on someone then sets him on fire,  now this someone is set on fire and would never die because of it but he feels the pain like a normal person would and for the rest of his life. 
Don’t you think it makes sense that : someone killed himself + Y is a murderer? 

However, we need to acknowledge that sometimes it’s the victims who had motivation less than average (in that same situation) to stay alive, and not the bully who caused their suicide. It still is his responsibility partially, but not totally.
Just like when X stabs a person with a pencil in their finger and they die...he intended to hurt only, not to murder, and he intentionally hurt enough to just hurt but not to take the risk of killing. in this case X isn’t a murderer. He might be something else but not a murderer. Same applies for bullying."
SuicideWatch,fcjrtfg,t1_fciwa37,1577701450.0,"Glad you’re feeling better. 
He got his likes because there is a lot of people who would be amused by his comments, not because they think the same. 

Did you meet your bf?"
SuicideWatch,fcgkzi9,t1_fcedwg0,1577641289.0,"Better than not alive though. 

What do you mean by disowned?"
SuicideWatch,fcdohx3,t1_fccacvk,1577611968.0,"Some random man asking to be contacted by the author of this comment and also the post, saying that all they need is him to make them happy. It was creepy and so inappropriate."
SuicideWatch,fcavinr,t1_fcakual,1577577436.0,God! what’s wrong with you?
SuicideWatch,fcav86w,t3_egq96h,1577577273.0,Updates please??? Are you okay?
depression,fc8czm0,t3_egf8pl,1577532133.0,"Video games are awesome, it’s only positive feelings with them (except when you’re getting ganked or your teammates let you down stuffs like this, but even these are still relatively positive feelings) 
When you play video games, the world feels so good, so safe, so pure."
depression,fc620nb,t1_fc61abs,1577470480.0,"no this is some modern society bullshit. 
It’s completely fine for everyone to live with their family if they aren’t a burden on them (and you aren’t since you’re taking care of them)"
depression,fc1hl35,t1_fc1bblb,1577319004.0,""" so I can plan a trip in see him."" I got little joyful goosebumps from reading this, I’m really glad you’ll see him 

Also glad you’re not in the correctional anymore...you’ll work in something enjoyable and peaceful which is nice 

Don’t worry. Thanks for trusting internet enough to open up a bit. Was nice talking to you ^^ 
(And sorry sometimes I talk about myself but it’s just to let you know you’re not alone, to ease the pain for you, I have no intention to make it about me)"
