You're welcome to link it again, but I don't see how you're going to counter what is verifiable fact. 

Nationally, in 1999, firearms made up 2/3 of the suicides in America and suffocation/hanging made up about 1/6. Now firearms are just below the 50% line and hanging is 1/4. Hanging is not terribly behind in numbers today what gunshots were in 1999. 

In Virginia, in 1999 there were 503 (7.2 per capita) reported suicides by gunfire and 102 (1.5) by suffocation. In 2017, there were 672 by gunfire (7.9) and 256 (3.0) by suffocation. 

Suicides by gun saw a moderate increase while suicides by suffocation doubled. I don't know what study you think makes that sound like getting rid of guns would get rid of suicide, but I see that the issue isn't the method, it's the fact that suicide has been on a steady rise and we're doing very little to stop it aside from playing whack-a-mole with the methods. 

> Suicide by firearm has quadrupled in frequency since the 20th century.

By what metric?

In the US, the CDC reported 16,599 suicides by gun in 1999. In 2017 it was 23,854. I'm no mathematician, but that's not even double. Per capita, it increased from 5.9 to 7.3.

First off, I'm not sure they'll save any. 

The CDC reports 11-15 people of any age a year dying by accidental firearm death in Virginia (EDIT: I should specify that I went with the last 10 years on record, 2005-2015; I saw no reported numbers for 2016 to current). I couldn't narrow that down to age. I have no idea what percentage of those will be stopped by the storage laws, but even if all of them are kids and stopped, it won't equate out to hundreds. 

There aren't 500 homicides in the Commonwealth a year, much less by gun. 

The Red Flag laws are debatable in value and most of the state has said they're not interested in enforcing them. Similar laws have resulted in either police or the intended party to end up dead when they come to confiscate people's weapons. And again, I've seen no indication the 1 handgun a month law will have any real impact on illegal firearms transactions. 

This is before we take into effect that there are tons of firearms already in circulation and most of these laws only expand penalties, not create new categories of crimes.

All of this has to be balanced against defensive gun use. I don't know what it is in the state, but nationally there are 100,000 defensive gun uses per year nationally according to gun control group the Violence Policy Center. 

So while you are quite certain these are a boon, I doubt we'll see any major changes against trends in the near or even distant future, especially as what the Democrats are doing is handing the Republicans a great wedge issue for the next few elections."

Again, you have no idea how they're defining ""assault rifle"" here or even if they are. You're making an assumption which may have nothing to do with the content of the articles. 

Let's assume for a moment that you're correct, though. Let's assume that ""assault rifle"" was a commonly accepted term for semi-auto rifles derived from fully automatic weapons. Aside from the fact that there are a lot of semi-auto rifles that would be caught in assault weapons bans today (like pistol caliber carbines) that bear only the faintest resemblance to those weapons, the fact that some guy in the 80's misused a term that has a proper definition does not in any way validate similar misuse down the road.

We obviously disagree. Proper terminology helps people make better statements as well as support better laws.

Weapon choice is one small consideration for someone who gets to pick the time, place, and conditions of their attack.
