entp,fel17sj,t3_epnnpj,1579211858.0,"Humans can generally be summarized using fundamental desires and behavioral modifiers. Fundamental desires include needs, wants, belief systems, available information, time, resources and conflicting objectives. Behavioral modifiers include preferences, personality, intelligence, capabilities, and limitations.

If the people on your world are anything like humans on Earth, some of them will have a drive to cheat the system and get around limitations on their consumption. These people will work hard to find ways around any system that tries to constrain their fundamental desires. The more popular a set of fundamental desires is within a group of people and the resources available to the people with those desires, the more likely that set of desires is to be fulfilled.

This fundamental-desire-fulfillment principle will tend to enforce itself no matter what economic system you try to set up; or how you try to arrange the rules. This has the consequence that in the end, it doesn't really matter what system you try to set up - there will always be pressure within and around that system to fulfill the fundamental desires of the participants in that system.

So, how would a world without money function? Well, if the people in your world have similar personality distributions as the people on Earth, you will still have greedy people that will find ways to accumulate wealth, because they are interested in that; there will still be people who really like to eat a lot, and they will find ways to get access to more food than the allowance; there will be fundamentalists and liberals and conservatives and religious leaders and religious followers and hard workers and sloths and scientists and gamblers and liars and cheaters. All of these people will find a way to do whatever they want to do - to avoid any limitations you try to place on them wanting to fulfill their fundamental desires. That's how every world will work.

If you change the distributions of personalities or fundamental desires, that will change what kinds of people you are likely to have in that system and the types of fundamental desires that will be fulfilled. The way money works in that world would add a constrain and a dynamic to how they fulfilled those objectives; but that fundamental rule still applies.

As an example; if murder was a very popular fundamental desire in your world, even if it was made illegal, it would still happen a lot."

You first need to write a procedure on how to test for consciousness. No amount of simulation will answer that question for you.

Also, if you simulate a virtual environment, the simulated agents would exist in that virtual universe - they wouldn't have a natural interface to interact with us.

>and some say we may get virtual conscious agents only if we build a quantum computer because it would be based on quantum mechanics and the brain is quantum computing.
