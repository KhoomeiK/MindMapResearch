Her 1 you see her summon the mote plant things from somewhere. She doesn't generate them, just gets them through a portal. Presumably there's a garden of motes somewhere out there.

Her 3 is her creating an unstable portal which releases an energy burst, and if it's used on a mote she goes through the portal to move to the mote.

Her 4 is, obviously, a portal to the sun.
