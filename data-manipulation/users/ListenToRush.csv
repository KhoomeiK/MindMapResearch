GenderCynicalCritical,ffdu0w4,t3_esyz3x,1579828906.0,Reading this makes it hard to believe they're not fetishizing womanhood.
Tennessee,ffdsqyg,t1_ffdsccd,1579827989.0,I understand and feel for you. Thank you for the civil response as well. We all lost a great pioneer in music - I'll join you in that moment of silence. Best wishes to you.
Tennessee,ffdrpy9,t1_ffc9jcn,1579827290.0,"I'm confused. I do not have a degree yet (I'm in university now at age 25) and my highest paying job so far has been in business administration. I was making $23.50 an hour. How have you not made it to that point yet with two degrees? I'm very surprised. I worked hard to make it to the point of earning just $23.50 an hour, but not nearly as hard as I've been working on my degree. You are doing something wrong or you live in an area not conducive to your abilities."

MedievalHistory,feu55k2,t1_feu133d,1579383217.0,Good luck
MedievalHistory,fetzmkj,t1_fetvifi,1579381626.0,"I agree with the other response. I've been learning classical Latin and have immersed myself in it through university courses and self-study.  I'm still nowhere near proficient enough to write something  as complex as the example prompt. You would be better off advising that the prompts be written in English, as it will reach more people and be more efficient. Have everything else be exactly the same, historically accurate, and well-written. You will not find many people outside of experts who are able to help write a script in Latin, Ancient Greek and other ancient languages."

MapPorn,fe9sg09,t1_fe9m0u0,1578941055.0,"None of this is racially motivated. Even the latter article states that Buttigieg shouldn't be so quick to assume racial mischief on the side of Kemp. The first two are completely irrelevant. You are claiming that blacks in the South are repeatedly condemned and held down when participating in politics, yet you have not given a single piece of evidence, even in the Stacy Abrams case as it appeared to affect Democrat voters, not specifically black voters. Blacks do not equal Democrat voters. You are boxing black voters into a ""Democrat Voter"" hole, and that assumption in itself is racist as it assumes that all black voters will be Democrats, removing their agency to choose (and once they vote differently they're called an Uncle Tom, which is a terrible thing). Do not assume all black voters think the same, and do not lump them all into a single box. That is a terribly racist and regressive assumption."
MapPorn,fe9i2j9,t1_fe8qbd0,1578937718.0,"IF this is true, did the Republican candidate go through and specifically target black voters, or rather Democrat voters? If it's the latter, then how is this suppressing black votes when whites vote Democrat as well? It wouldn't be a specific attack on blacks in politics. It would be a shameful act of disingenuity, but not an act of specifically black vote suppression. Blacks vote Republican as well - were those black votes suppressed? Sounds more like a political hit than a target on blacks, if it even happened. I cannot find definitive proof that this ever occurred."
MapPorn,fe82cnm,t1_fe81i7v,1578921668.0,"I'm curious about certain circumstances. I live in the South. I am surrounded by my politically active black friends in the South. I am immersed in this and simply do not see it. Are you from here or is this your area of study? Do you claim to know these things for a fact? If so, please provide an example because I want to fight it alongside you."
MapPorn,fe80x97,t1_fe6b6q8,1578921133.0,"To the contrary, I see that black politicians are lauded where I live (in the South). I would be very curious to see an example of a black person being prevented from/demonized for exercising their political beliefs here in the South."

Ensure that the government and corporations can see your every move and desire such that they know more about you than you may even know? Distract you from intellectual pursuits? Divert your mind from spirituality/philosophy/science to technology? And then you become a programmer, living your life indoors except for the occasional beer-riddled hike through an already carved path in a park where there are hundreds of others, saddened by a yearning for something that you can't put your finger on so you just go on reddit and laugh at memes to further distract your mind from the hole that modern tech has created"

You could write a book, be a professor, go to law school, work at McDonald's, be a construction worker, be a researcher, or just broaden your knowledge in an ancient art and discipline that reflects your way of life. You could also come across others who are similar. If all you need to do is get a degree because your family is pushing you to, then why not? Seriously, read Robinson Jeffers' poem ""The Answer."" You might find aspects of your mentality reflected in it."
