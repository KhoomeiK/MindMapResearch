1. I was playing games on my mom’s iPad one day. The next day, she asks me why she got an email saying that an Instagram account was created with her email address. I know I hadn’t done it, and she didn’t either.

2. Fast forward to sometime last year. The iPad from the last story is old, not very valuable anymore, my mom has a new iPad. So I’m watching a YouTube video on it, and toss it on the floor. The audio cuts out. I fully close the app and open it again, and the audio works. Somehow, the impact made the YouTube app audio cut out. This had not happened before, and has not happened since.
