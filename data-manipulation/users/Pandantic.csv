I suppose it also depends on many factors like if the factory is in an area with open land around it so they can extend the building to accommodate a new packaging machine, if there are skilled workers available in that area that can operate the machine, and where the items will ship to afterwards (as in your packing plant might be closer or centeralized to the many shipping locations). And after all of those factors are taken into consideration, then they compute the cost vs the option your factory offers both short and long term. It's a lot of options to consider."

It sounds similar but not exactly the same. We are pretty sure after seeing the vet that he had a stroke because he favors one side. He also lost vision in one eye completely and the other partially. He is bruxing a lot, which I though was pain but the vet said it could just as easily be from the neurological problems in his brain. He has some HLD too but not too bad, but he has very little balance, no sense of spacial reasoning, and he sometimes twists in a weird way. The vet said he's not mentally all there, and I see that too."

My best advice to you is to be honest but keep control of your emotions as best as you can. The kids are going to be all range of emotions and you want to let them know that it is okay to be sad, and you are sad too, but you are also a rock for them to latch onto in times like this. Shed some tears, but if you feel like breaking down, call someone in to relieve you. 

When it happened a my school, I and other teachers that were greatly affected by my student's death had a guarantee break person, and even people (they came from admin to help) to check up on us, see if we needed help, a break, etc. 

Also, I hope they bring in grief councilors for all the students, but they are there for the staff too. If you need to offload, that is their job - to listen and give support and encouragement. 

And the mental health facility my school uses guaranteed appointments to any staff affected by the tragedy so you may see if that's offered. If your school is any good, they will let you know what they have in place to support. 

Best of luck."

Adolescent boys DO flirt with/say creepy things to teachers sometimes. No one who thinks their student is doing this is ""assuming the worst"". It's not a ""bad"" behavior, it's just inappropriate due to the setting (professional) and the nature of the relationship (authority/subordinate). The teacher here uses ""creepy"" in place of inappropriate for ease of communication."
