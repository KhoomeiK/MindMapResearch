You'll worry you're unprepared.  And you'll be right.  All the parenting books and advice from people who babysat their sister's boyfriend's cousin's husband's ferret for a weekend once that you think sounds useful will not arm you for when you walk downstairs one day to find your daughter has used a treasure troll as a paintbrush to cover the living room in mustard, adding milk as necessary to keep the paint slick.  And you'll realize that nothing could have possibly prepared you for this, but even that will just be a hint at how unprepared you truly are.

But even in the midst of that, your first concern will be to get the mustard off her cheek before she gets it in her eye.  And when she apologizes you'll forgive her, unconditionally.

You will never want to strangle anyone as much as your own children, but would still give anything for them.  And you don't understand how true either of those are until they're there."

I'd wager the number of parents who wouldn't do this are proportionally little more than a rounding error.

 And no, the majority of the force comes the moving lever your swing creates. It's an axe moving about three feet down. Gravity isn't moving that with sufficient force to split wood.

You can watch him do this. See how his hands close together as he swings? That's how an axe works. 

Ave handles don't absorb the force. If they did they wouldn't split as well. So they bounce. Hard. And since you've closed your hands to complete the swing, you can't control it.

Upward mobility is limited by raw numbers. Management vastly outnumbers the floor. So it isn't something you should be looking at long term unless you can drive a lift truck, because it pays better. You can't expect promotions because the pool is huge

P&L assumes accurate ELS, so the real test isn't employee reporting (which will always be disproportionate negative), it's if it is revised within a year or two because of incongruence with actual earnings.

Warehouse work is over optimized and physically demanding everywhere. It's more a shitty industry at entry level than a shitty company. I work at a grocery warehouse that has nothing to do with Amazon. If you consistently missed quota you'd hear about it here too. That's just how logistics is.

It used to end with an elaborate theory about a non profit called Nimble America that wanted to put memes on billboards. A stupid idea, but not the (equally stupid) idea op thinks they have. But he blames someone new pretty regularly.

Now I firmly believe most posts that follow this structure are paid for. But it's possible their just crackpots. But what we don't need to doubt is that thousands of people just bought into a narrative that's based on nonsense.

I only buy from grey market sites because you can't compete on price. But the crackdown on them is coming and probably should. They're kind of a bad look on the whole thing--they don't generate tax revenue and sell to kids.

In their defence for the 2018 date, they overproduced because the grey market wasn't supposed to be there, so you end up with long lives on the shelf.

The reason nobody buys it legally in Canada is the consequences for selling it on the grey market are trivial and will always have lower prices. That will probably change. And realistically should. Grey market sites have less oversight than the typical eBay seller.

Dispensaries can't compete with mail order because they pay taxes and have the overhead of a storefront. The only way to stop it is with severe and certain consequences. This isn't something the system will correct on its own."

It is normal for *everyone* to engage in reassurance seeking. Children don't do it commensurate to the issue because they don't understand it's disproportionate.

*Any* research on reassurance seeking in young children will explain this. That you don't know means you have no idea what you're talking about. So why speculate?

When people say Freud is dead, what they're referring to is exactly this.  It's really easy to make up connections between things and attribute it to development.  Ridiculously easy.  It's also based on nothing more than intuitive guesswork.

A child worrying about lost love being a consequence *is* normal. It's normal for all of us.

Who hasn't heard or asked ""Still friends?"" after a spat with a friend?

Or wondered ""Are we gonna get through this?"" after a fight with a partner?

I'm not chasing this indefinitely, and you aren't going to fool me by spouting whatever Freudian pop-psych nonsense pops into your head.

All of them mention a source anxiety triggering it.  It is normal for everyone.  We *all* engage in reassurance seeking.  That love isn't returned is a bit of anxiety literally everyone who has ever loved has experienced.  You just get better brakes if you develop normally.  3 year olds don't understand ""unconditional"" and don't have good brakes at all.

No psychologist would even blink twice at this.  Feel free to go float it down any academic list or subreddit you like.  It's Freudian pop-pyschology nonsense.

Incidentally, the single strongest predictor of borderline personality disorder (all axis ii disorders, actually) is family history.  It's primarily genetic, or at least requires a genetic component.

Next on the list is abuse.  Not that it triggers it without a genetic component.

Virtually every toddler asks this when they're anxious. It's normal.

To a 3 year old big mistakes must have big consequences. This seems a big mistake to them, so they, entirely rationally from their view, worry about the very frightening and very realistic possibility that this will have the worst consequences.

There's no debate here. This is, 100 percent, perfectly normal. That you can imagine reasons it's not doesn't change that.
