musictheory,feaucld,t1_feaqe9p,1578952227.0,"Yeah, I did a bad job explaining my meaning, see my other reply.

As for the fundamental, no, there's only one. By depressing the valve, you interrupt the natural flow of air. A bugle or herald trumpet are great examples here, as they have no valves whatsoever. By adding piston valves to trumpets, we do lengthen the instrument to ""change"" the fundamental, but the overtones do change, which is why trumpet players need to kick out their first and third valves to keep notes in tune."
musictheory,feathzy,t1_feapx34,1578952082.0,"I think I did a bad job of explaining. The harmonic series is removed from context, the overtone series follows the pattern, but is grounded in the limitations of specific instruments.

The harmonic series applies to any fundamental, whereas the overtone series refers to a specific fundamental on a specific instrument. Does see that make more sense now?"
musictheory,feaj2oq,t1_fea0zy9,1578949504.0,"The lowest, loudest pitch, at least on a brass instrument, is ALWAYS found in a neutral (1st slide position) or open (no valves depressed) position. There is no ""other"" fundamental unless you're talking about the overtone series, which is related to but separate from the greater harmonic series. In the case of the overtone series, the pattern you described does indeed occur in every position, but there is only one fundamental per instrument. Bb Trumpet has a fundamental of Concert Bb. Horn in F has a fundental of Concert F. It's not a matter of being on the same page as one another: we're reading separate books altogether."

The same applies for trumpet. The Bb that comes out of the trumpet in the open position is called C in Trumpetland, so that matches your series only in name, not in true pitch or frequency."
