It's not even high tolerance, I get dizzy really fast (first 2 shots) but can't escalate from there."
trashy,ffday94,t1_ffd495b,1579816950.0,"Nope, never had an experience like this, even after 2 bottles of vodka, peak drunk for me is being dizzy and wanting to go sleep, I envy the people that can just lose themselves as I really don't enjoy alcohol."

ChoosingBeggars,feh2220,t1_fegysy8,1579107515.0,"Indeed, this trend started 10 years earlier on my area, the influx of new graphic designers willing to work for free destroyed the marked value of digital arts to the point where nowadays every single graphic artist position is occupied by mediocre people that barely now design whereas the talented designers struggle to make a living as graphic design, modeling and art in general are now regarded as ""for fun"" professions and no one is willing to pay a competitive professional price for anything as there's a lot of untalented/inexperienced new graduates that will even do it for free."
