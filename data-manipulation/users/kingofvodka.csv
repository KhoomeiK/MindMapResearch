This 'agreement' allows China to not do anything about the situation, and still save face. They take steps to stifle Taiwan's influence, but that's about it. They're the 'same country' after all.

If Taiwan changes its official position to 'independent Taiwan', then they no longer 'agree' on the situation. It becomes antagonistic and forces China to make a decision - do they completely back down and let Taiwan establish itself as a new democracy closely allied with the west, or do they assert their 'one China' claim?

1. I do like to mess about within the confines of a song - this one was followed a little more to the letter because it's right at the edge of my comfort zone, and the voice is a little tougher than normal to control, especially in the switch to the higher register. I should probably have tried to do it a little though to get a better example to critique, you're right.
2. Never even considered that opening/closing my mouth would have an effect on the sound, but that makes a lot of sense. Not sure what riffs/runs means, but you've given me an enormous amount to Google anyway so that'll go on my list.
3. I love that you said that because it's actually my own main criticism of my voice in general. By virtue of the fact that I mostly do it in my flat and get self-conscious of volume, I have comparatively much less practice projecting my singing voice than I do being more gentle with it.

No idea how to read music - I know roughly how the concept works from the 5 or so violin lessons I got as a child, but never saw it as particularly valuable in a non-professional setting. If you're telling me that it can help with ideas/visualization, then I'll definitely work on it. There have also been times in the past where someone playing  accompanying guitar asks what 'key' I sing a song in, and I have no idea, so it'll be nice to get over that.

And lastly, thank you so much for the list of concepts to Google. Having a list of actionable topics to go through will help immensely, though for sure I will be finding a teacher this year too."
