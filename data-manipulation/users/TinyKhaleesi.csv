aww,ffj2j2d,t1_ffiz4l5,1579988764.0,"When I went to visit the cat rescue nearby, the cat I ended up adopting walked up to me, climbed into my lap, and purred.  Some cats are just very affectionate! 

Grim had actually already been adopted but then was returned for being too cuddly."

muacirclejerk,ffizylh,t1_ffgz9hw,1579986907.0,I’ve wanted this one for ages but it’s a special edition for Spring from a couple years ago that sold out and now is VERY expensive online :(
GetMotivated,fevwlug,t1_feth2cm,1579402365.0,"I loved med school, it was an amazing 4 years. The worst parts were the cost and being so far away from my family. But school itself, especially the clinical years? Fantastic. I enjoyed what I was learning, I still had time for hobbies (less, compared to undergrad, but still time!) and made a lot of really lovely friends. 

I will say, however, that if you don’t enjoy the medicine itself, it isn’t worth it. It’s hard, lots of work, exams are very high stakes and stressful! But doing what you love easily makes up for that."
GetMotivated,fevuse8,t1_fesettg,1579401784.0,"One of my best friends in med was 29 when we started! There were also plenty of others in their 30s, even a few in their 40s/50s.  We graduated last month, just before her 33rd birthday :) 

Good luck and enjoy it!"
