fatlogic,fczuxb6,t3_ejncnr,1578109037.0,"It seems like I'm in the 5%, so I'm just going to disregard this"

fatlogic,fcz4z56,t3_ejkive,1578093771.0,"Calorie counting is probably not 100% accurate, but I've lost a lot of weight with it. You don't really need to be super exact if you aren't bumping up against the boundary. My 1700cal budget is the extreme upper limit, not a challenge..."
fatlogic,fcn4d3s,t1_fclpoq6,1577802925.0,"Congrats! I'm about 15lbs from a healthy weight, so here's to both of us getting there in 2020!"
fatlogic,fckypon,t3_ehoffh,1577736046.0,"""...same rights and deserts.""

fatlogic,fcj2as6,t1_fcgpt1c,1577675505.0,"I should have, but I didn't. I'm grateful that my dad has been super supportive of my weight loss."
fatlogic,fcgimax,t1_fcgcxsf,1577640430.0,"Typical thin privilege, don't you know that fit people have terrorized the obese for millennia? /s"
fatlogic,fcg17ew,t3_eh6ews,1577635534.0,"I just experienced this today. I was telling my dad about my run, and his friend immediately bashed me for being health focused."
fatlogic,fbhupf2,t3_edddlq,1576882812.0,"It's both. I will concede that people no longer give me shit for being fat, and that makes me feel good. But I also enjoy having more energy, less back pain, and a sense of accomplishment. I run a mile every day (which would be flat out gibberish to me a few years ago), and I love the high walking out of the gym."
