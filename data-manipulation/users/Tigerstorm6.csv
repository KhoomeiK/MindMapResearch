AskReddit,ff52k1b,t3_erhu3x,1579578490.0,"I’ve had several dreams I wanted context for, and some I wanted to finish. But the one for this post, would been last nights dream. Honestly, it wasn’t because the dream was interesting, but because I was fucking scared if it was real.

Some backstory, my brother and I used to go to the same elementary school when we were kids. It was a catholic private school, really good people there. So in my dream, my father needed us to run some packages to the school and my mom wanted me to take my brother and my dog along with me.

We finished our business in the school, my dog going up to teachers and basically getting attention. As we walk out to the car and get in, I notice my keys are missing. My mom calls me saying that she’ll deliver the keys, but it’ll take time so me and my brother start messing around in the car. Like messing with air vents, moving the seat back and forth, the usual things some dipshit brothers would do. 

Only, this is where it gets terrifying. I look up in the rear view mirror to see the stereotypical gangster, wife beater shit, jeans, tattoos, and a mustache that screamed drug dealer. He had a gun in his hands, and was walking toward us. I panicked, and tried to turn on my car, only to remember there were no keys.

And then, BOOM! I heard a gunshot and suddenly the back of my head felt really cold, like pinpoint cold near the spinal cord connecting to my skull. In my dream my body slumped forward, blood rushing out, and I could faintly hear my brother scream. Literally the second I died in the dream, I woke up and screamed bloody murder. After some face smacking to make sure I was alive and real, my dad checked on me at like 5 in the morning. Apparently as he was getting up he heard me yell. 

Very few dreams have had me do that, and this was the first. I was honestly scared to fall back asleep, terrified as to what my brain could conjure up. But at the same time, I want to go back and see what the fuck it was all about. A hit and run? Intentional murder? Robbery? Vendetta? And more importantly, I want to know if my brother and my dog got out alive. 

Thanks to my depression, I didn’t mind me getting the bullet (which is scary enough as it is). But if my brother and my dog got hurt, I would’ve been super pissed. But it still scares me, cause I felt my body go cold and limp in the dream, and I’m terrified to even go to sleep tonight."
