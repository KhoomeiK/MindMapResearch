BlackPeopleTwitter,ff6qnd9,t1_ff6leov,1579632853.0,"I’m getting too old to spend time beating my head on a wall with people who don’t have interest understanding this to begin with (not referring to you specifically).

But since you’re at least somewhat interested in where I could go with this, I’ll drop a shorter explanation and stick around for whatever points, or insults, you want to throw. I am at work though, so I’ll respond eventually. 

In regards to natural sciences in our current economy (be it zoology, marine bio, or even broad environmentalists), there is a severe lack of funding. Companies do not see these things as profitable, as they are not necessarily turning out goods to sell (some of these degrees can help on regulation boards, and the like, but ultimately the knowledge itself is not easily turned for profit). This leads to fresh grads in these degrees having to rely on either knowing someone who can get them into a position right after walking the stage, putting up with an unpaid internship, suffering under low wages, or being one of the few lucky enough to actually land a well paid position (this is rare though). 

Now, this *could* be addressed under capitalism, but with the current struggle against regulations, the fossil fuel industry wanting to remain profitable, etc, this is unlikely. This is where communism comes into play. One of the stated goals of communism is not only to bring the means of production under the control of the working class, but in total to reduce the total amount of time people need to work in general. This seems counterintuitive to my stated position of increasing labor, but hear me out. People that tend to pursue natural science degrees are not doing it because they think it is profitable. They do it because they genuinely care about the world around them. Those who take unpaid internships either have family that can support them until they are well established, or they decide that their work is more important than their own standard of living. This second group is the one I want to focus on the most.

Now, someone earlier stated that “communism wouldn’t make new jobs for zoologists, it would simply keep them from having to work as a barista”. This is partly correct, but stops short of the full potential of more “free time” (in this sense, I mean time spent working a minimum way job to pay rent and feed your self). With that burden lifted, those with degrees in zoology, or any natural science, now have the ability to pursue their line of work. This can pop up in a variety of ways. Some may go to the government to find field work with the department of agriculture/energy/etc. Some may go to NOAA, EPA, or state level agencies. Others may work to build more zoos, sanctuaries, preserves, and the parks in general. Even more can pursue local education.

These degrees can be used in a plethora of ways, but ultimately hinges on societies view of their importance. I personally believe that much of this “stigma”, there’s probably a better word, but I’m writing a reply, not a dissertation, is influenced by corporate goals. Whether we want to admit it or not, corporations play a huge role in our government, and lobbyists push hard to have funds/grants pushed towards major sectors like defense, energy, or agriculture (much of the ag funds tend to be crop subsidies though). I believe that by removing that corporate influence, and by removing the burden of the cost of living from your average new grad, we would see a blossoming of jobs within the natural sciences, especially as we reorient from a profit focus to a people focus. 

This is obviously up for debate, but to dismiss this premise off hand (or to say that capitalism plays no role in the current situation) is extremely short sighted. I prefer not to chalk up other peoples’ reaction to my viewpoint as pure spite, but instead believe that people often over look the impact socio-economic stress has on these kinds of things. 

Agree or disagree, but claiming someone is “retarded” for holding that view shows more about one’s own ignorance than mine."

With:

> I grew up in this house. The house is everything I have ever known. My mom is a wonderful landlady and takes her job as one seriously. To get torn away from it so unexpectedly has caused me a lot of emotional distress.

Like you want to appeal to emotion and gain sympathy, but then hold that view towards tenants who can’t afford rent. Seems a bit ironic to me honestly.

Communists tend to hold a very negative view of landlords for the exact reason you are expressing distress about losing the house: people depend on a stable living condition, and often hold a degree of sentiment towards the home they live in. The risk of losing that all due to a landlord wanting more rent, or simply disliking the tenant, is a massive source of stress. Hence why there is a belief that housing shouldn’t be commodified (edit: there’s a lot more to it than just that, but I’m not gonna write an entire dissertation for this post). 

I am sorry you and your mother are going through this, and I wish the best for you. But I’m not sure why you’re directing your anger at the people who want to abolish the system that just committed violence against you, and not the system itself."
