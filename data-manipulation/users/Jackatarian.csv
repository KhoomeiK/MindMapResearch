I ended up on a back pain management program last year with 5 other people. Some of whom were in pain longer, some shorter, all were considered disabled, all of whom were medicated to some extent.

Your need of ""proof"" of physical damage/anomalies for pain is insane. Pain is subjective, changes from person to person, the cause of the pain signals could be completely invisible. There are people with zero cartilage left in knees and elbows with zero pain and people with nothing visibly wrong in agony. 

The backpain program I was on essentially tried to teach us how to get closer to the pain free extreme than the painful one (this is a lot to ask of anyone, probably impossible for a lot of people, highly unlikely to work for most and life changing for a few and just another tool in the belt of life for some others) One of the largest things I brought home from that was how varying peoples pains can be.

AskUK,fflql1r,t3_eu5pbd,1580042828.0,"I might get flak for this but I would look into ""barefoot"" running, obviously you still wear shoes, but the shoes are designed with little to no height difference between the heel and the toe of the shoe, allowing for a natural running gait. 

For millennia humans have been running barefoot, on the balls of their feet. Only very recently did we invent the running shoe (1920's ish and even those didn't at first come with a thick heel, modern running shoes came about in the 1970's). So we begun running heel to toe, which is more impactful on joints and less efficient. 

When running naturally toe or toe-heel your body stores energy in your tendons like a rubber band, using some of that to propel you forward instead of it all coming from your muscles.

AskUK,ffixuh7,t3_etp835,1579985373.0,"For me it entirely depends on the hours of the job, the mode of transport and transport depending - the amount of transfers. 

Say it's your normal 9-5, your commute is 2 hours, requires you to walk 20 minutes to the station, get an hour train, transfer to the underground, transfer to a different line and walk 15-20 at the other end: This is too long for me, you can entertain yourself for half the commute the rest is active. You have to be up at 6-6:30 and you don't get home until 19:00+

Now take a more simple commute, it's still fairly long at 1 hour 30, but it's just the one train of an hour and a couple of small walks at either end: This is much more reasonable, 2/3 of your commute can be entertainment. You can get up at 7, home by 18:30.

Maybe I'll tell it backwards, why not. 

So here I sit now with 95% of my possessions in my one room, items outside of this room are two bicycles, shoes, coats and a desk fan for the summer and kitchen utensils/food. 

Over the past year I have acquired one piece of furniture (An open metal wardrobe, which I can dismantle when I move) and removed 13. (I have removed a bed side table, a MALM desk drawer, 2 KALLAX storage squares, a MALM 3 drawer chest of drawers, a foot stool and a dining set I was storing because I inherited it.) I have reduced my long term storage of certain things, clothes, replaced some things with longer lasting versions or multitaskers and focused on moving everything into the one room and still maintaining a tidy appearance. 

Before that I have moved around a lot, as an adult and a child. I always owned less than other people because of this, I never had a childhood home for most of my life so things that were not needed were discarded along the way. 

After my parents died I obviously inherited everything they owned, and it was a lot of stuff, I had to go through everything, a loft filled with boxes of once looked at magazines, a garage full of old car parts, tools I would never use. That probably sparked it even further. 

When I was 20 I decided to travel for a while and I needed to find a cheap solution to keep ""stuff"" so I made myself a goal of fitting everything in a 1.5m^3 storage locker. This unfortunately meant getting rid of 95% of my book collection, and that is the only regret that I have. Although I still am happy I did it. 

This last push came after finding this subreddit and realising I already was a minimalist, and I'll be moving again soon and I will likely only have the one room so necessity dictated it even more. I am now much more comfortable knowing that unless I truly move into the cupboard under the stairs: I will have a place for my things."

minimalism,ffd9zm4,t3_esv04q,1579816351.0,"I had this happen to me (but nothing really specific apart from a small box my mum had already put together for me but it was mostly stuff from MY childhood, attached to memories I had).

The largest item I kept was a dining set. Huge table with leaves to make it larger, 6 solid wood chairs. Weighed a ton. I chose it, I said to myself this is the thing, the one thing I'll keep. The dining set was there in the house I was born into, I had memories of hiding under it for hide and seek, a dozen pets played around under it and gnawed on it's lower parts. 

But I had nowhere to set it up, it was and will likely always be too large for the life I lead. It's been looked after by other family, it's been split up and put in lofts, garages, behind my bed, I've rotated using some of the chairs in my room and in friends rooms. I have paid to have it moved from place to place. 

And finally it came to a head, I realised I was already doing minimalist things and dove deeper into minimalism and it was time for it to go. 

I contacted auctioneers, antique dealers, furniture salesrooms and the information was clear: you are too late. Dark solid wood furniture of this style is no longer in fashion, you would be lucky to sell it at all. 

So I found someone to give it to, quite fitting, a mother with a son in her 30's just like when my mother bought the table in the first place.

When you eat collagen/gelatin etc our body breaks it down so it can be absorbed, then your body builds what it needs from that. 

If your diet lacks sufficient building blocks that is one thing, I would suggest changing your diet. But if you already have the building blocks, changing what you eat to get them won't change a thing."

ChronicPain,fejjxtb,t3_epcw90,1579177349.0,"GP appointments are seemingly more rushed than ever, so I would suggest ordering your needs/questions in order of importance. After a long time of not taking care of myself because I was so focused on one specific thing (backpain) I went in with a laundry list of things that I needed to discuss and I got about half way through before they kind of shut me down and asked me to make a second appointment/wait to talk to a specialist (What specialist doc. that's what I need from you). 

Good luck with everything."

I don't see how that is terribly relevant though. We lived there for 4-5 years at different rates, but as soon as the ""adults"" were dead then it's time to kick us out. 

Not by the next year, not by mid December: Christmas. We the catholic church are kicking you out on Christmas Day."

Me, my mother, my cousin and his dad (my uncle) moved into a house owned by a local church. My mother passed away, and a few years later so did my uncle.

The church then decided to kick us out, to raise funds for a new heating system for the church. They gave us 2 months notice, and without any kind of irony told us we had to be out by the 25th of December. 

We had to find a new place to live that would allow us to keep the two dogs we just inherited, I was not in work at the time and we were 18-20 years old, so that was a huge ask. We had to sell, donate, scrap a 4 bedroom house and move into a small 2 bed. Had to sell cars, kitchen appliances, deal with the funeral and debtors. 

This situation sucks.
