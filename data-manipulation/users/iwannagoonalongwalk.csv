offmychest,ffhk2cu,t3_eti9mh,1579938869.0,"So my boy tends to have a lot to say. He’ll go into the kitchen an whine. I thought he wanted food, was trying to tell me something, had anxiety or other issues. Finally figured out he likes ‘birthing kitty’. Lol! Finally sat him on my lap and made a circle with my thumb and fingers for him to squeeze his nose through as I pet him. Do this over and over and for some reason this is so relaxing for him and is the one thing that settles him down. He’s my weirdo. His sister is a little more easy going. (As long as your not her brother, he quite often pisses her off lol.)"

offmychest,ffcwc3l,t3_esr353,1579808628.0,"Please check out kittenxlady aka Hannah Shaw on Instagram. She is the Queen of rescue kitties and actually fostering a little boy named Jez who is going through what your baby is going through. 

Fuck that vet for wanting to euthanize your little baby when you’re willing to give her a chance. Kittenxlady founded the orhpankittenclub just for this reason, she believes all small ones deserve a fighting chance. 

You may want to get a second opinion. Only my two cents, because Jez’ leg heeled incorrectly on its own and now I believe they are waiting to have it amputated. That could be very costly. 

Best to you and your little one. You are so awesome for taking this sweet one in. She will love and take care of you forever."

When I was a junior in high school my dad let me go to the King County courthouse in Seattle with a friend to view trial proceedings, because I was fascinated with law and wanted to pursue it as a career. The girlfriend I went with and I ended up sitting in on a murder trial. Though there was not a personal connection, it was evident how heart wrenching it was for the family and the experience sticks with me to this day. Witnessing how they all sat through the proceedings even when gut wrenching evidence was being brought forward made me come to believe it was all part of the grieving process. Putting this person in front of them, to attest to how much they were in pain for losing their loved one, seemed very important.

I think it’s easy to underestimate the maturity of a young one in defense of protecting them, but if it were me I would be careful in taking these moments away from them... especially if they are adamant about going. From what you say they’ve been very involved up until this point so it wouldn’t be like there should be too much ‘shock’ value to the experience, other than what is to be expected. 

Though I would also make clear to them at any point in the trial if they are not comfortable seeing or hearing what is happening, they need to get up and walk out."
offmychest,ff6ty6z,t3_eru1na,1579634821.0,"Holy krap... this!! 

I am female, and on two separate occasions, during times I decided/had to become more assertive to suit my life at the time, two different loved ones went as far as to call me a bitch. 

Seriously made me question, was I that much of a pushover up until that point? Was I allowing myself to be taken advantage of by those around me because of my easy going personality? 

WTF to be called a bitch, by of all people, those that are closest to me? And in gut wrenching honesty, it twisted my cap back because I truly believed in my heart of hearts, I was doing my very best to communicate my assertiveness due to the stressful positions I was managing at the time."
offmychest,ff4q46s,t1_ff4ktal,1579569741.0,Thank you!
offmychest,ff4luzi,t1_ff3wfvx,1579566753.0,Yup this.. called having your cake and eating it too. And while they may make up excuses of why they couldn’t leave because they were afraid to hurt the one they’ve been with for so long... um Yeaahh?! because in the end it hurts a whole hell’uv a lot more. Proving the reason they stayed and cheated was completely based upon selfish reasoning.
relationship_advice,ff2bvb0,t1_ff22mjq,1579500048.0,"This!! Great advice. What is that saying about “failing to see the forest through the trees?” 

Your folks love for you is being obstructed by their love and caring for you. Your dad most likely just wanted to feel like he could make a contribution to the household. Accidentally he made a miscalculation and imagine now feels possible guilt and very likely hurt. Your mom, naturally being protective over you lashed out in her defense of your safety. Possibly as others have mentioned this could be about deeper issues she has or has not communicated about with him up until now. The unfortunate thing for you is that it sounds like they have lost sight of the negative and harmful aspects of the overall relationship with an innocent third party involved. 

Perhaps, as another poster alluded to, if you could somehow find a way to seriously ask your mom for a good dentist to fix your teeth (this will make a great story one day). A therapist to help you in dealing with ‘them’ until they can get their shit worked out, And please know, you’re not alone, there are so many dysfunctional families out there that go through times like these. Please be easy on yourself and try not to blame yourself for any of this. Try and look at this as one of those lessons in life where shit just happens and people will choose to take certain actions and/or have opinions and though you were there and present to the situation, you are in no way responsible or liable to absorb the negativity of the situation."
relationship_advice,ff1e3zv,t3_eqvtiq,1579478022.0,"I’m fearful of the abuse your poor kiddo has endured up to this point in your absence, that you are unaware of. Now that you are aware of what she is capable of of it is up to you to protect your child from this monster. 

Sadly it could be very likely this is the product of abuse inflicted upon her at one time, though it does not make it right. It is up to you to at the very least not allow her to use your son to continue the cycle."
relationship_advice,feq56cd,t1_fepaiep,1579337757.0,"I hate to break it to you, but you chose to have kids, it’s called reality. With that choice comes taking care of them. It’s time to get your ego in check and refocus your priorities on how you can best communicate with your husband regarding sharing the duties of taking care of your children."
offmychest,fept145,t3_eq7mmn,1579330273.0,Run. Fast. Just run away fast. Your feelings are not worth this lack of caring and disrespect and you will thank yourself for it down the road.
offmychest,feotcvs,t3_epxeri,1579305117.0,"You are so awesome for realizing that this was important to your dad now, and you have no idea how important, and what this will mean to you in a few, maybe ten years."
offmychest,feontj1,t1_femh3qe,1579302683.0,Thank you.
offmychest,fem5de8,t3_epue4f,1579240335.0,"You love your kitty, that is an awesome place to start.., I’m not sure what city you are in, but cat cafe’s are becoming quite popular. Look on social media and see if you can find one near you. Often they have events where you can get involved giving you a chance to meet others who share a same interest that you have. Often they need volunteers and it could be a great way to meet others and a fun way to spend your time."
offmychest,fem4pco,t1_fejhofu,1579239672.0,"This is so succinctly stated. My stepbrother took his life last summer and it’s going to be a long road for a lot of us. Especially my stepmom. As much as I miss my stepbrother, I now also ache for her. The pain is exponential."
offmychest,fehhg5r,t3_ep3hjy,1579116609.0,"I’m so sorry, this is so sad. Humans suck."
relationship_advice,fe6i9gq,t3_enr8t8,1578891744.0,"To each their own, but I will never understand this. Okay maybe I will, but will never allow it to be acceptable. Dude, life is too short for this bullshit."
RBI,fdzibt4,t3_ena6uy,1578790508.0,"How sad, this made me think of a Forensic Files I watched just the other evening. A teachers body was found in a burned out car. Turns out it was murder at the hands of a man (and his young daughter), that had hired to do yard work by the teacher earlier in the year. They came back to rob her. Heartbreaking, for a measly $400 or something like that. Luckily, for the investigation the suspect left behind a fingerprint on a bottle of her whiskey when he stopped for a swig after sexually assaulting her, and prior to killing her. 

I am so sorry for your loss, and as such in that situation, I hope whoever did this to her was unable to cover their tracks, and will have left behind evidence that will spell out to authorities what happened here. Time will tell."
RBI,fdf0s3p,t1_fddub34,1578350724.0,"This would be my concern that it was someone hired to do work at the house. They’re looking for something to make a quick buck off of, or to scare you for some twisted reason, and like you said had to leave quickly, got spooked (perhaps how the cut happened) and took off."
