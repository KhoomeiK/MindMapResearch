We kept his longer for like the first two years of his life, but When it’s longer it gets tangled easily and then we’re dealing with brushing it which he obviously hates. So it’s a lesser of two evils thing for me, a haircut every three months, or having to hog tie and brush huge tangles out of his hair every day. Plus, and maybe this is unpopular, but i want him to look properly groomed.
