It's hilarious that people think Beltran didn't bring the entire scheme to the Yankees when he was hired into the FO. The Yankees knew the Astros were cheating, Beltran was the ring leader, and the Yankees decided to hire Beltran into their own FO. Then they win 100+ games despite having a completely decimated roster. Hmm....

The fact is that if you're going to reject Manfred clearing the Astros of 2019, then you have to reject them saying the Yankees weren't involved. There's exactly as much evidence that the Yankees cheated in 2019 as there is evidence the Astros cheated in 2019.

They included 2019 in the scope of the investigation, if the Astros did in fact cheat, then it would benefit MLB to disclose it.
