Nothing wrong with the photos. They're beautiful. I just don't like mass producing prints of my face. Ha."
weddingplanning,ffrch1y,t3_eustcl,1580155199.0,Can't wait to see that review. Jeez! I'm so sorry you had a horrid experience with them.
raisedbynarcissists,ffrcb5z,t3_eun7up,1580155100.0,"Yes, but I don't think by now my mother will bring herself to acknowledge it and apologize to our face. She left me and my half-brothers vulnerable to physical, emotional, and (for me) sexual abuse. She is hard headed and constantly victimizes herself because ""she went through so much"". It's like she thinks she really did a good job of keeping her issues at bay when we were kids. No. We sat through every screaming match, ran away from every knife chase, and endured a screaming alcoholic pervert all because she was weak and couldn't leave to save her kids. All because what? She was afraid of being on her own.

We're raised under the culture of respecting older generations. Unfortunately for her, my little caveat is that respect is earned and a two-way street. She feels entitled to abuse us and belittle us but can't take it the other way around. And by now, at the ""ripe"" age of 32, I'm here wondering when she will finally respect me as an adult.

Just kidding. I've stopped wondering. Whether she decides to treat me as an adult or not, the second I began living my adult life I realized that I didn't need her approval to be the adult I know I am. So while my mom lives this sad life, constantly trying to avert the inevitable family gossip (that SHE, TOO, is apart of) and going by her predictions of that, I'm in a DGAF mood planning my wedding and interviewing for a couple of PhD programs. She knows little about the process for the first, and barely about the latter. When I try to explain, she interrupts me or she won't listen. It's become a conversation where I am dead silent and after she is done talking, I end the call politely. Should she notice this lack of engagement, I hope that it brings her to reflect upon her own actions. However, I won't be disappointed if she doesn't.

You're not alone. I think the biggest achievement I've made so far in my efforts of personal growth is to know that no matter what they think, say, and do, they will never, EVER be able to change what goes on in your mind. I don't take advice or feedback from people whose decisions I don't respect. Soooooo needless to say, they can keep talking. You don't owe them a listen."

The beading is what sold it for me. I originally wanted sparkle but was told by coworkers that they can see me in a more “classic” dress because I dress pretty basic at work. I thought I did, too, but I just couldn’t help and feel like a neutral bride in it even if it looked good on me. I think I confused liking the *silhouette* of these classic looks with liking the actual dress, because after trying this one, I lost all desire to take it off and to try more on."

Offer to show her some tips and tricks. “If you’re interested, I can show you some tips and tricks.” She decides to comment on how her boyfriend likes her without makeup? Say, “That’s so good. That’s why he’s your boyfriend!”

Start responding directly to her comments in this way so it is addressed by the both of you each time it happens. Otherwise she’ll make a habit of saying offhand comments under the assumption that you’ll just smile and nod."

AskWomen,fek2kue,t3_epgsr6,1579191266.0,"Yeah. We became long distance three years in and he was naive and inconsiderate. He assumed our relationship would work out because we were in a comfortable place and I would understand that I’ll have to be lower priority as he started his studies. (Lower as in barely speaking.) I’ll have to “wait until he’s done with the 5-6 years of grad school” before our relationship picked up where it left off.

Needless to say, those two years of distance were extremely difficult. I put my foot down hard. That isn’t how you treat those closest to you. You’re busy? It’s life. You have to find a balance or accept that you’re not cut out for a partner. And if you choose to have one, treat them like another human being. I’m not some game you can pause. I would say that in hindsight, I may have cracked down on it pretty aggressively but I was sick and tired of him assuming that I was being needy when he was the one being avoidant. Anywho, we’ve now closed the distance gap and have been together for seven years. He has seen a counselor and done DBT classes. We’ve been doing very well the past couple of years and will be getting married on our next anniversary this year."

Nbd that he’s reckless with his finances, and intentionally finds ways to work around it by buying things behind your back. Nbd right? It is.
