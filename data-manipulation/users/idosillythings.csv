JoeRogan,ffgfmvc,t1_ffgb0u7,1579905154.0,"There's that word again. No one, not a single person has retracted their accusations that O'Keefe has edited his videos. 

You didn't even link to a retraction. You still haven't. You linked to a libel suite being thrown out, which again, is not the same thing. Proving libel does not require the same proof that those videos are edited. 

He even got caught trying to scam the Washington Post into running a fake story , ie, lying.

JoeRogan,ffg6ge6,t1_ffg4z1l,1579899476.0,"I have, or did you miss that part? I have watched them. They're edited to take things out of context and completely move statements around."
JoeRogan,ffg4a47,t1_ffg3hn7,1579898144.0,"That's not a retraction. 

That's a libel suit getting thrown out and it's not the same thing. 

Proving libel is extremely difficult in the United States. You have to prove that the claim was knowingly false and done with the intent to cause monetary harm. 

[One of the very judges](https://apnews.com/d187a373b69943ccb902e7578208304e) that threw out a libel case has said that Veritas is only skating by on the fact that libel laws are outdated when it comes to digital media. 

> The judge said before issuing his decision that political discourse risked being hampered if citizens and the media were handcuffed by fear of legal liability, but the law also needs to impose some standard of responsibility. The line in this case was between what the law requires for proof and what jurors can decide is the truth, Reidinger said.

> “While the internet has broadened the number and the variety of available voices in the marketplace of ideas, it has also served to undermine the public’s confidence in the veracity of those sources,” Reidinger said, according to a transcript of Wednesday’s court session. “That fine line has to be walked. And I think that walking that fine line required this court to take a close look at what issues are really for this court and what issues are really for this jury.”

If the claims were actually ""retracted"" O'Keefe would be suing the shit out of Time Magazine and other video editors who have said that they have found he's edited his raw footage beyond comprehension."

The idea that there's nothing original there. Those are all your opinions and you're welcome to them. I just find it hilarious that you think that way because it boils things down so pointlessly. 

What your real opinion is is that Stormlight is a superhero story. Ok. 

You don't like superhero stories. Ok. 

Perfectly fine opinion.

The idea that in the American Civil War, Grant was just a drunken butcher, while Lee was a gentleman tactician who only lost by because of fewer numbers, sort of falls apart when you read Grants biography and see how Lee sent an entire company(?) to its death charging the stone wall at Gettysburg, despite many warnings against it. 

Lee wasn't always the best general. Grant wasn't always drunk. 

It's also fair to say that not all of the criticism leveled at Monty can be laid at the feet of American propoganda. 

For example, and as I said I'm no historian, but I find it hard to believe that I should look at the failure of something as large as Market Garden as something solely created by a paratrooper field commander for not hitting a bridge at the exact right moment."

asoiaf,fcr5j23,t1_fcqeyg4,1577897085.0,"Yeah, I don't understand the mindset of attacking or trying to tear down recommendations. 

Not everyone who reads a book or a series is in it for the same reason as you. We don't know what other people like. There's nothing wrong with suggesting different things cause you never know what people reading will latch onto. 

Lord of the Rings was my first fantasy series. 

And I basically didn't touch the genre again until I started reading ASOIAF. 

Since then I've found that I love pretty much anything by Sanderson. Wheel of Time, grimdark by Abercrombie and Lynch. I even like the (in comparison) mediocre Forgotten Realm stories, because I just love the escape of fantasy. 

I don't need every character to have 20 different motivations. I don't need surprise deaths. 

Maybe someone else does. Ok. That's fine. 

But that shouldn't stop me or someone else from recommending a broad swath of things."

Personally, I am of the opinion that it's all been done before. 

You want to say that Stormlight is nothing more than a superhero story. Ok. I disagree, but whatever. Even if it is, I don't feel it takes away from its originality as to how it builds its world, its magic system, its plot and characters. 

It's just like I don't think it takes away from the originality of ASOIAF even though I could have the opinion that Martin is ripping off stuff from Tad Williams, with his multiple points of view and dark introspective characters. 

But that would be idiotic because there is no such thing as a truly original genre anymore. What denotes originality is how the work is built around whatever story line is being presented. 

Watchmen isn't all that original if you look at it from your point of view."
asoiaf,fcpix85,t1_fcp9n4m,1577865437.0,"I think people need to get outside their bubble here. I love this series but there are writers out there who do grimdark and fantasy on an even better level than Martin, and not just Tolkien. 

Abercrombie writes better characters, in my opinion. (First Law Trilogy)

And Scott Lynch does low magic/random character deaths in a much more fun and mind challenging way with his Gentleman Bastard series. 

I don't know, people on here are talking like Martin is the greatest fantasy writer of all time. I don't know if I'd even out him in the top 5 working. But, that's my opinion."
asoiaf,fcpickh,t1_fcpfo8c,1577865103.0,"As a fan of both ASOIAF and Stormlight, I think you're vastly underrating Stormlight. 

Calling it unoriginal is just trite contrarionism. The world and magic system of Stormlight puts Martin to shame. And that's not an attack. Martin doesn't specialize in detailed and vast world building or creating interesting magic systems. He specializes in character driven political intrigue. 

Just the ecosystem of the Stormlight world alone requires credit, as Sanderson shows how a world constantly battered by massive storms would change the flaura and fauna. 

I have read a lot of fantasy, and watched and read a lot of super hero movies and comics and I can't think of anything that could be seen as being stolen by Sanderson to build that magic system. 

And, I'll give it to him, I think his plotlines are tighter than Martin's. In my opinion, he does a better job of keeping things moving and in line. 

There are literally pages of skipable food descriptions in ASOIAF. 

Again, this isn't an attack on Martin. But you're a fool if you can't recognize that Sanderson is arguably one of the best fantasy writers working. He may not be for you, but calling him unoriginal is ridiculous."
