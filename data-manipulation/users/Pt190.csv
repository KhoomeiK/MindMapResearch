A question here that I wonder about is: America sends \*billions\* of dollars to Africa, and it not only appears to be without result, inasmuch as war, poverty, and highly unjust governments still rule many places there, even to the extent that articles get written about how the aid is not only ineffective, but even harmful.  But yet the OP story describes how the contributions of \*one man\*, including introduction of lending services in an amount that isn't mentioned, but which surely must be far less than billions of dollars, can so deeply and fundamentally change an area for the better.  So the question is: why is the ROI of the capital placed at risk in this microlending scheme have so very, very much more ROI than all the aid has, and, what might it take to increase the capital by means of an outside philanthropist, in such a way that it also attains this greatly improved ROI?"

NatureIsFuckingLit,fe5u30v,t1_fe5pyjr,1578874959.0,"Wood has a ""breaking strength"" such that, if you bend a certain-sized piece of it with more force than the breaking strength, it breaks.  Air has a ""dielectric breakdown strength"", of about 3000 V/mm, although it depends on electrode shape and also on pressure, humidity, temperature, etc.  Which means that air can ""hold off"" electric fields less than that, but the air ""breaks down"", i.e. sparks, if the field is more than that.  By field, here, I mean voltage divided by distance.  

If you had a 3000 volt power supply (or, 1000 three volt batteries, all in series so their voltages add), if you brought the wires closer than about 1 mm to each other, it would form a spark.  When people walk across carpets with shoes, the people can easily charge to five or ten thousand volts.  That's not enough to break a foot, or even an inch, of air, but it will break a few or even 10 mm, which is the typical length of doorknob sparks.  (You have to really work to make a spark longer than 10 mm, but it can be done a good polyester sweater, a natural fabric sofa, and a whole lot of friction.  These sparks amount to about 30000 volts on the person, give or take.)  

At the molecular level, at the 3 kV/mm field strength, the electric forces arising from this field strength are enough to rip electrons free from the air molecules, and then accelerate those charges (in the ""opposites attract"" direction, negatively-charged electrons and ions going to the positive electrode, and positive ions going to the negative electrode), such that a current flows in what used to be electrically insulating air.  Sometimes the fields are enough to form avalanches, in which the electrons and ions are moving rapidly enough that when they smack into other neutral air molecules, they dislodge electrons from them, too, and those resulting charges also start accelerating in the electric field. 

The upshot of all of this is that the air suddenly becomes a conductive - and, glowing - plasma, i.e. with free charged molecules and electrons, flowing electrical current - and, dissipating electrical energy - and this plasma is the visible spark.  The spark, being conductive, discharges whatever had made the field in the first place.  In the case of static electricity, the discharge doesn't take long, whether it's a spark from your finger to the doorknob or a bolt of lightning, but if there's a constant power source, such as the 3000 V battery, or, also, a ""Jacob's ladder"", the discharge continues until the power is turned off or the electrodes burn away enough or melt such that they become too separated to continue to sustain the arc.  Note also that it's harder to start the spark than to keep it going.  However, it does still need power to keep it going, and once the current falls to a certain level, it's no longer enough to sustain and the plasma is quenched.  But, humans only take some microseconds to discharge in a spark, so, the current of a static spark doesn't last much longer than this.  In the case of lightning, there might be a cubic mile of air that all needs to be discharged, and reaching it all (with the little fractal lightning tendrils you may have seen slo mo videos of) can sustain the current for more than a microsecond.  

Sometimes, when a volume of air gets discharged, the neighboring air, which was also at a high voltage, but not high enough to form lightning, suddenly sees completely discharged air right next to it, and so discharges into it.  This is why lightning sorts of expands outwards, often in a series of multiple strikes (usually only separated by milliseconds, too fast for the eye to easily see).  But, sometimes, the fact that lightning is actually repeated strikes can be perceived by eye.  The main ""trunk"" of the lightning keeps being reused as the conductor, but, the little branches keep branching out, discharging more and more air.

NatureIsFuckingLit,fe2x8go,t1_fe2tzya,1578843875.0,"The reason there is lightning in a thunderstorm is that the friction of water droplets moving through air can acquire static electric charges, much as the friction of walking across a carpet or petting a cat can also generate static electricity.  When the overall static charging builds up enough to break the air down, a bolt of lightning is formed, in  much the same way that when you reach for a door knob after traversing the carpet, when your hand is close enough to form a spark, it sparks.  But, water droplets aren't the only things that can accumulate enough static charge.  Lightning is known to occur in snowstorms, called ""thunder snow"", and lightning also occurs during sand storms.  (Videos of each can be easily found in a search.)   Here, we have volcanic ash being thrust through the air, accompanied by lots of turbulence and hence friction, and the ash particles can charge up from this friction in the same way, ultimately charging enough to break the air down as lightning.  Because there's lots of violence (and hence friction) in the eruption, the lightning is particularly strong and frequent.

Another thought experiment is to consider ""the wave"" at a stadium.  Each seated person stands up, waves, and then sits back down again. Each is only standing up and sitting down at normal speed, but ""the wave"" moves sideways depending on the relative delay between neighboring people.  In principle, that wave could move faster than a sports car, faster than the speed of sound, or even faster than the speed of light, if you gave everyone perfectly timed instructions of when to stand, wave, and sit down."

Where the water is miles deep a tsunami may be only a few feet high, but as the water becomes shallower closer to shore, the wave slows in speed but becomes larger in amplitude.   We don't know the water depth where this was filmed.  But, actually, we might be able to estimate it based on what we see here in the video."
interestingasfuck,fcnj9xi,t1_fcnh0xh,1577812770.0,"tl;dr: because how sound propagates through gasses and condensed phases is different.

If you stick within the realm of gasses at the same temperature, lighter gasses move more rapidly because ""the same temperature"" means ""the same average kinetic energy"", and, to have the same kinetic energy with lighter mass means v has to be more.  Because they're moving faster, lighter gasses have higher sound speed, and it goes like the square root of molecular mass, because of the v squared term in kinetic energy.    
But, when you condense the matter into liquid or solid form, it's not just the speed of motion of the molecules that goes into sound speed but also the packing density (in a liquid) and the chemical bond strength between atoms (in a solid).  The atoms basically bump ""immediately"" into their neighbors in the condensed phases, and so sound speed has to do with how fast the bumps travel, rather than how fast the atoms themselves move.    
Some winners in the sound speed department are beryllium and diamond, which have light atoms but also strong bonds relatively tightly packed, and they have sound speeds of about 10 km/s, give or take.  Roughly speaking, the sound speed in air is about 300 m/s, but in water and also in gaseous helium is about 1 km/s, give or take."

DadReflexes,fcn9wy0,t3_ehpt44,1577806990.0,"P waves travel faster than S waves, and they are audible and feel like a vibration rather than as swaying. (I have been in a few small to moderate earthquakes.)  For distant earthquakes, there is a worthwhile delay between the first vibration and the strongest motion. In this film the father reacts quickly to the first motion before the camera shake - and house shake - is evident."
DadReflexes,fcn8uot,t1_fclu4sn,1577806253.0,"If the quake is strong enough to break windows, then there will be a zone of falling glass which you will be passing through as soon as you step outside.  This is particularly true around tall buildings, which both have a lot of glass and also at great heights.  Additionally, broken glass is slippery, so if you dash outside you can slip and fall on it and get cut from that.    If you are outside when a quake strikes, move away from windows and brick walls, again especially around tall buildings.  Go to a clearing if possible."
nextfuckinglevel,fcme8or,t1_fcm5ykf,1577772084.0,"Here's something to think about: mass shooters almost never begin their rampages with police in sight, ergo, police almost always arrive at a scene after the fact and have to figure it out for themselves, i.e. who are the good guys and who is or are the bad guys, differently from armed citizens who, when they intervene, are quite often there at the beginning and know exactly who the bad guy(s) is or are.  The case you mention is a rare exception, although, note that he didn't shoot.    


Returning to the OP, imagine if police had burst onto the scene in the OP after 1.9 seconds, after the first shot - can you be confident they'd go after the bad guy rather than the hero on the left, conspicuously aiming a handgun at another?  There have actually been multiple cases of cops shooting good guys in shootouts, including cops even shooting \*other undercover cops from their own departments\*.      


I think the upshot is that cops shoot innocent people mistakenly misidentified as criminal much more often than CCW holders do. A possible contributor to that is that police are rarely held criminally liable when they shoot or kill the wrong person (e.g. the driver of that UPS truck a few weeks ago), but armed citizens are.  So the latter have a huge incentive to take care in their shots."
