What helps me though is forcing myself to talk to at least one person that I know would care about me. I have always been amazed by how much those people energize you and bring you joy.
SuicideWatch,fe7jl6b,t3_eo2s5m,1578915469.0,"I 100% agree you have been so strong in living with it, I hope you use that strength to look for help wherever you are. I really want you to remember that your feelings are a part of your life but they are not your whole life and I hope that you use that incredible strength to get through the very temporary pain you are feeling right now."
SuicideWatch,fe7i8wp,t3_eo2l1f,1578914870.0,I can't imagine how much hurt you might be feeling right now but I want you to know how proud of you I am feeling for just being you. I think you have so much to give in terms of love and compassion through your incredibly unique experiences. I really hope you talk more about your beautiful Trans Journey and show the world more of that strength.
