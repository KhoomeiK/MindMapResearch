Interesting how this is your take away. You haven't provided anyone a reason to think it's true or likely which is why people are downvoting you. Playing devil's advocate isn't always the heroic thing you seem to think it is. Posing a possibility is useless. You can pose a thousand possibilites, but again, that doesn't make it a good argument worth posing. If your best argument for your position that this kid might have been slipped thc (which is a ridiculous argument on its own) is that people don't know what the definition of devil's advocate is, you're only further giving reason for people to think you don't have a good point to make."

People playing devil's advocate usually have a reason. If you want to go on a strict definition that a reason isn't required, then sure, good job. That doesn't suddenly make it a good argument.

Interesting how this is your take away. You haven't provided anyone a reason to think it's true or likely which is why people are downvoting you. Playing devil's advocate isn't always the heroic thing you seem to think it is. Posing a possibility is useless. You can pose a thousand possibilites, but again, that doesn't make it a good argument worth posing. If your best argument for your position that this kid might have been slipped thc (which is a ridiculous argument on its own) is that people don't know what the definition of devil's advocate is, you're only further giving reason for people to think you don't have a good point to make."

People playing devil's advocate usually have a reason. If you want to go on a strict definition that a reason isn't required, then sure, good job. That doesn't suddenly make it a good argument.
