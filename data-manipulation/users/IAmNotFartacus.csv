I fully agree with their last sentence, that poverty and hunger are threats to human dignity and demand attention. But I'd argue it's not the lack of food that's the problem for poverty-stricken areas, it's the denial of these people by outside forces to obtain food through their own labor.

Take your example, where I am the sole provider of a need to you. In order for your scenario to actually work, I would have to be able to deny you the ability to purchase that need from a competitor, as well as the ability to provide that need to yourself. *That* is where your rights are infringed upon. This is also why monopolies are (and should be) illegal.

Now, I think it's safe for us to agree that we have a right to the products of our own individual labor. Do I specifically have a right to the product of *your* labor? Do I have the right to anything you make or purchase for yourself? Even if it's a need?

This is separate from whether these things are needs and whether there is a moral obligation for individuals to help the needy. I truly believe that conflating needs and rights is what leads us to socialism, because now it's everyone's responsibility that everyone gets a house, everyone goes to school, gets food, gets healthcare, and all of it for free.

In the absence of a nuclear deterrent that doesn't involve MAD, I'd say it's a necessity for as long as other countries, particularly hostile actors, have nuclear weapons or are trying to obtain them.
