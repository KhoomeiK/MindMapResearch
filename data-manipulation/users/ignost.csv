exmormon,ffiqw3f,t1_ffibbzm,1579980463.0,"Yeah, I was also exposed to people of a different faith and realized, ""Wow, they have the same feelings about their religion as I do."" For a Mormon who relied heavily on the ""holy ghost"" this was concerning.  Lots of Mormons are ready to say others spiritual feelings are invalid if they disagree with Mormon feelings. On my mission it was hard to dismiss people who felt different from me because they were sincere people right in front of me.

The mission also made it harder to just think about it like a casual religious person. You really need it to be either true or false. After giving so much in money, sweat, and tears it's hard to put myself in the mind of a casual Mormon. You think there is a literal prophet of God, but you disagree what he said about gay people? I mean I'm glad you don't like bigotry, but thinking for myself was almost impossible as someone who totally bought in."

technology,ffio9ne,t1_ffidvuj,1579978637.0,"Just to add, this is intentional. Large banks lose money on poor people. In fact they lose money on most in person transactions, but it's still profitable to have a branch to service wealthy people.

Anyway, the banks know poor people aren't paying for any extra services. They won't get credit cards or loans. They're not doing wealth management, etc. So they intentionally price them out with fees and minimum balance requirements. 

If I as a wealthy person have fees, they will (and have) waive them. If a poor person has fees they will hold firm. Because they want to retain me as a profitable customer and ditch the unprofitable customer, the person who is least able to pay extra is asked to pay extra. Many industries from health care to education have similar policies to make life harder for the poor, but these are long explanations.

This is how things work with large corporations if no one tells them they can't. If they can't prey on the poor they enact policies to keep them out."

I think we could do this just fine by reducing income tax, raising sales tax, and expanding programs like SNAP to help those in need.

I lived in WA where there is no income tax and there are a lot more social supports. It seemed to work reasonably well. My concern with all income tax is that there are so many ways to cheat on income taxes. For example, the wealthy just expense all their earnings away with 'business' trips and find dining in warm exotic locations. And unlike the rare SNAP fraud, every business owner takes advantage of broadly defined business expenses.

I am 100% in agreement with  the argument that high prices on groceries and other sales goods disproportionately impacts the poor. I also know that an inefficient way to help the poor is to help everyone. You can subsidized gas, groceries, and basic necessities for everyone to help the poor, but why not just help the poor directly. Also introduce tiers of assistance to avoid disincentives to go above the poverty line.

Could we maybe focus on a compromise where every increase in sales tax is met with an increase in food assistance and similar programs? Insofar as the state fails to do this I'm against the tax change, but maybe there is some middle ground where we can guarantee future support for those who need it."

Fact is that the majority of the victims tend to be female and the vast majority of abusers male. Across cultures we can see that as male dominance and female subservience in a culture increases, women are treated worse, less likely to be believed, and less likely to have an recourse. Men meanwhile are less likely to face equal punishment for their crimes. I don't think we have enough (any?) modern female dominant cultures to study, but this is in contrast to more egalitarian cultures.

You can look at the very conservative male-dominated cultures in Asia, the Middle East, or Africa. You can see this trend in European and American history, even in the not-so distant history. You don't even need to limit it to sex. When your culture institutes tiers of varying human importance between groups you end up with tiers of rights and justice. In this case it's women who have a lower level of rights and a higher degree of injustice."

This sounds real close to blaming the abused wives of abusive husbands, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you're not talking about blame. You think the women who were raped, shamed, and taught not to question men are going to speak out against their abusive husbands? After a lifetime of living in fear, you probably continue to live in fear. It's called learned helplessness. From another of your comments on a related thread:

> Ok. Why the focus on the abusers not the victims?

If you'd ever counseled someone who had been slapped down every time they stood up for themselves you'd realize the focus is there because that's where the blame lies: at the feet of the people doing the abusing and the culture that protects them.

This is not mutually exclusive with having empathy for the victims. I do feel for the victims. I suspect the majority of victims were young girls, but there were also probably some young boys being abused who in turn abused girls.

I don't say that to be rude. I think this largely comes from your insecurity, and you long for external things to solve that for you. It likely won't happen.

I can argue with you all day, but this isn't coming from a rational place. **You've not asked men and women about the pros and cons, weighed the validity and severity, and come to a rational conclusion.** You just don't like how things are going, and have chosen to blame part of it on gender. You have focused exclusively on the negatives with no thought for the positives and very little insight into what women go through.

So I could tell you about how women in most societies and businesses are not seen as experts despite a similar level of expertise. I could tell you how much it would suck to know that basically any man could overpower you, and that at least one very well might in your life. I could try to explain my wife and sister's endless frustration of always being judged by your appearance and weight over anything else. We could talk about how men are paid more and never have to experience pregnancy or periods.  But my guess is you're not real interested in hearing it.

We've got some sicknesses in our society for both genders. You point some out, exaggerate others, and fail to look at the other side of it in almost everything. I happen to think it's easier to be a man.

You want to feel wanted, valued, important. There is nothing wrong with that. But blaming your gender is not the way to go. Step back from thinking things just happen to you, and remember you are in control of your actions and can change who you interact with and how. There are lots of men, myself included, who feel loved and valued.

So I can't go into how to help you feel better, but I believe your opinion is born of feeling insecure and unconfident about your own value. If I am wrong please let me know, but I hope I can change your mind that you're not really looking at this in a balanced way and some therapy could help."

AskReddit,fepev4f,t1_fena6bv,1579318760.0,"I agree for 90% of the things people are saying in this thread, but there are definitely some big external things that have a lot of power over what we call happiness. I say this as someone who is and has been very happy for years.

First, there are for sure external factors that can make you **miserable or not miserable**. Not having to worry about debt and finances is a relief, but it didn't make me happy. I think I was already happy, but dealing with some misery. 

Then there are things that strongly influence my happiness. Having good long-term friends really helps me. Having a family that's loving and always has my back is great. A loving wife who is 100% devoted to me and me to her is wonderful. I can't think of anything besides **relationships** that make me happy. Anyway, I can't look at someone with an abusive or dysfunctional family and pretend it's just as easy for them to be happy.

Third, I think it's pretty clear some people are just naturally more happy based on their genes. There are genes for depression and anxiety. I am familiar with an ongoing not-yet-published study that will almost definitely show higher rates of self-reported happiness from people with specific genes. There is another study showing people with more Neanderthal genes are more prone to depression. Let's just be real that it's harder for some people, and may require lots of brain training to focus on the positive.

Ultimately I agree that too many people think external things like having more money will make them happy. IMO that will make you less miserable, but not happier. I think we need to see being ""miserable"" and ""not miserable"" as a different thing than ""happy"" and ""not happy."" It's easier to feel happy when you're not miserable. It's harder to feel happy when you're miserable. But I have experienced both.

I think I am in the minority that has been close to ""100% happy"" for a while. I also have just about everything I mentioned above working in my favor. 

To everyone looking to feel better: it is largely internal, but don't blame yourself if you're unhappy. It is a process, and you may be starting way behind my starting line. It's not a race to be happier than others. It's about having a more enjoyable life for yourself."

Intellectually I can't find a good reason someone being trans should matter to someone who doesn't want kids. But it does, because I'm not an entirely rational being.

Also it's 100% mandatory to disclose, and ideally before a date. I know poly people who use similar arguments to delay telling the other person they're married. If you are not sharing information you know might make someone not want to date you, that's deceptive and manipulative.

Maybe, but when you murder someone you need to follow due process unless there was an imminent threat. This is what the US claims, but so far they've failed to provide any evidence of this imminent threat.

This is akin to the police getting a phone call that a known troublemaker has a gun and is planning something, showing up to his house, and shooting him dead while unarmed and without further investigation. Maybe he was planning something, but this is not how we do things. We have due process and evidence for a reason. We don't murder suspects based on suspicions, even if the suspicion turns out to be correct. That'd be a crime in the US and it's a crime internationally.

>  The Iranian Regime is a terroristic dictatorship, hated by its people. 

Oh lord, were you old enough to remember Iraq and Afghanistan? You sound exactly like those people. They said the Iraqi people hated Sadam and would welcome us with open arms. They played footage of Iraqis cheering in the street. And then reality set in.

The Iranian government is a lot of things with some definite ties to terror. I'm not ready to accuse the sanitation department head of being a terrorist. There are actually reformers in parliament, which leads to some on the guardian council. And also it's not hated by *all* of its people. Shit is complicated. What you're doing here is trying to make the enemy all evil and us all good, which is exactly how ""just wars"" get started. At best you end up with a narrow view of the world centered on your beliefs, unable to understand others.

> The trump administration is now choosing to handle it with deterrents (Killing terrorist officials)

You can't kill high-ranking state officials and expect peace. This is how you start wars, not deter them. If Trump doesn't get this he's not the genius he thinks he is.

> We aren’t going to war. No one wants a war, no matter how much the news is telling you that Trump wants a war. 

I don't think we are, because there's no win there for anyone and Trump has already said he doesn't want war. But it would be nice if there was a plan besides ""wait for the next hit and hit back 50x harder."" If you look a the causes of wars you see disputes with incrementally more serious retaliation is a pretty common way to start a war, not to prevent one. Iran realizes they can't win a war, but they can't be seen as weak domestically or internationally, so they retaliate. It's usually through proxies, but this time it might be direct. Trump of all people can't stand being seen as weak, so he'll do more. 

We're not there yet, and I think the WW3 stuff is way overblown. There is cause for concern, though, because no one in power seems to have a better idea than to keep punching each other.

>Think for yourself. Do some research outside of watching the news.

This comes across so condescending.I am being downvoted in this very thread for saying some of these things, but you still need to follow due process for killing someone.

I guess the right just wants to murder every Muslim they suspect of a crime, and the left wants to pretend there's no nuance to it if Trump did something bad.

Look, I think it's a terrible and stupid thing Trump has done, but let's not pretend Iran has never done anything wrong. This would not be even close to the first time they've coordinated attacks on the US via proxies after the US hit them in some way. They've done it many times in response to sanctions, US military action, and US diplomatic action regarding Israel. I don't support our blind Middle East policy, nor I am blind to Iran shipping weapons to Hezbollah or the Houthis.

I don't think it's necessary to show he was there on purely diplomatic mission to call this a war crime. The US has acted directly and indirectly against Iran as well. We'd treat it like a war crime if they assassinated someone visiting another country using diplomatic channels.

When you assassinate someone the burden of proof for them being an ""imminent threat"" is 100% on you. I think it's reasonable to believe he was there to coordinate attacks, but you need a smoking gun to murder someone over it. The US has so far failed to provide that evidence because I think intelligence officials lacked the smoking gun and were going off their intelligence.
