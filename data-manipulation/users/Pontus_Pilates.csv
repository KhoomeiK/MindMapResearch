I think a slow grind is fine if it isn't paired with ads for speeding up the grind. A slow grind can be a design decision to lenghten a game or make the progress feel more rewarding. Howerer, if the developer is at the same time telling you that the grind is kinda slow and you could pick up the pace, it's signalling that the grind is not slow because the developer thinks it's best for the game.

The other fundamental problem with 2K is that besides the progeress, everything is slow. If you want to do something in your career, you can't just choose it on a menu and you are there a second later. No, you need to walk around a gym, talk to people and stare at loading screens.
