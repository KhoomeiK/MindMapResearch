However within group MM I would love a system like this, You are already (theoretically) playing with people who arent as toxic or and/ able to actually take critisism well and defer their pride and allow someone else take the lead when the person doing poorly arent playing at their best. Balancing it or atleast the appareance of balancing it would be a massive headache though."
Competitiveoverwatch,fejy7yf,t3_epk1vk,1579188558.0,"Yea I think anyone in theory can climb to T500. I started OW off in Season 3 in mid plat and am now mid masters for DPS and just shy of masters in Tank/Support and im pretty confident that I could end up in GM with more time. The only things you really need to properly start climbing are good oppertunities, enough time and the correct mindset. 

You will never climb if you say you that you can't because you will start excusing your mistakes as proof that you cannot climb, and then never learn from said mistakes and keep making the same mistakes and keep losing games that would otherwise be winnable. Just because you had a bad game that doesnt mean you are a bad player, if you keep going you can and will get better.  But you also need to recognise when you are getting tilted and when to take a break.

You need time to develop the muscle memory and knowledge needed at higher ranks, either through bruteforce learning as you play (and gaining or losing SR from doing so) or by playing the mirriad of amazing custom game training maps that are now avaliable. 

And oppertunties. If you come across someone in MM you enjoy playing with or have a friend who plays OW at a similar level as you (or greater as a coach), playing/learning with them gives you a massive influence over the game and your winrate. You go from only knowing your own ability to knowing 1/3rd of your teams ability, If you play with 2 other people you now control half of your team, with people you already know will talk and respond. Just by playing with people you know you have already reduced/ removed the most random aspect of the game, the one that most people blame for their losses.

Ofc OW is win or lose, where you will lose more SR from a loss than you will gain from a win. and thus not everyone can be in GM at once but that wouldn't that matter in the slightest as there would still be a massive skill difference within the rank bracket everyone would theoretically be in."

StarWars,fef296l,t1_feei7k5,1579046469.0,"Having Balance in the force and being perfectly in the middle of the force are two different things to me. 

Being balanced in the force means that you can recognise your emotions but be able to control them without falling to the darkside. 

If however you are ""perfectly in the middle"" you cannot take an active role in the universe other than as a knowledge bank/ mentor character. [Like how the Bendu are shown in Rebels] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeXZPyAEQkA) 

To me the whole ""Grey Jedi"" thing to me is fundamentally against how the Force works, If a character has emotions, or wishes or anything that ties them personally to the galaxy which they then act upon, they cease to be that in the ""center of the force"" position and become a normal lightside/darkside force user. Having force beings that are in the centre of the force is always an incredibly interesting idea like above with The Bendu and to a lesser extent the Loth Wolves/Cats that are connected to the force itself, not the ""light or dark"" side."

You will always get fucked by some pencil pusher who sees nothing but sales figures and month expenditure charts. The only way to be in any way protected from them is to have enough of a voice that you can fight back, and if you get ignored you refuse to work and let them suffer for once."

Competitiveoverwatch,fdavu1f,t1_fdau9f6,1578250902.0,Big brain take right here. I don't like character X because I like my **team's** supports being personal slaves for myself and because X can be played on their own they should be nerfed into the ground.
Competitiveoverwatch,fdagusr,t3_ekam93,1578245967.0,2 teams standing in a narrow corridor firing blindly into each other with neither team taking the advantage? That route is a lemming trap which you basically cant progress through unless someone utterly fucks up in a majestically bad way like somehow throwing their shield down onto main or some equally stupid shit. Im not surprised that you are able to get your ult up that quickly in that scenario.

television,fd61uv2,t1_fd5gcyz,1578184382.0,"Season 1 is pretty meh with some good episodes (very kid friendly). 6 out of 10

S2 starts picking up the pace and adds Ashoka, Rex then later on Maul while having some really good deep dives on some of the characters. overall id say around a 7

S3 adds possibly one of the best characters in SW canon imo, Thrawn while going into a fair amount of detail for Mandalore, its people and its culture (something that could be useful considering S7 of TCW and understanding The Mandalorian) as well as adding the birth of the Rebellion. Easily 8-9

S4 is easily one of the best seasons of any Star Wars TV and you could argue that its better than some of the movies (obviously not a particularly high bar in some cases), Siege of Mandalore, jedi Night, Dume, The World between Worlds all top tier episodes. Easily a 9 maybe, I dont think there is ""filler"" or ""silly/ kid aimed"" episode in s4."
