offmychest,ffe5dft,t3_esvl1h,1579837132.0,"I’m currently using indeed to find my first job (teenager) and it’s so disappointing. Their way of organising jobs is annoying. I search specifically part time, in my area, and something I can do at my age, and I get stuff over an hour away. Not to mention, no matter what I do, I can’t seem to find a way to get rid of the “previous job experience”. They need an option for “none”. It’s frustrating to use Indeed sometimes."

AskReddit,fecc7tn,t3_eo6l00,1578970555.0,My middle school didn’t allow for brightly/abnormally dyed hair. So I dyed my hair bright purple. Then blue. Then silver. Then pink.
AskReddit,fe8o6er,t3_eo3q9l,1578928431.0,I’m at school so quite a bit
TrueOffMyChest,fdxh2g5,t3_en699t,1578768639.0,"As a violinist, I tend to need to have shorter nails, so whenever I can grow them out, or get acrylic nails, I’m happy. Yeah, sometimes they look very odd, but ugly is only when they are un taken care of, in my opinion. Yellowing nails, black underside. That’s nasty."

AskReddit,fdtbt35,t1_fdsbis6,1578714535.0,"A cop did this a year or two back in my town during training. Worst part was, it was near both a middle school (I was attending at the time) and high school (across the street). So we went on lockdown for two hours thinking it was a possible shooter."
AskReddit,fdtbgx9,t3_emyym5,1578714408.0,"Not serious injuries, but rather dumb. I broke my foot while tripping in a hole and hitting it on a brick. Proceeded to play on a trampoline afterwards. Broke my finger two days later catching a basketball wrong. Only a few months back, I broke my toe stubbing it on a ladder. I’ve broken my wrist too from falling while roller skating. I’m quite a clumsy person from time to time"
AskReddit,fdtabgc,t3_emvj3x,1578713979.0,"When people wake up from surgery or some traumatic event, landing them in a hospital, and are perfectly ok. I’ve been present for multiple surgery aftermaths and it’s usually full of cursing, lots of drugs for the pain, and no talking or any major movements. It’s annoying to see someone get up from having, say, a transplant for an organ (idk) and they wake up and are able to hold a proper convo and seem just peachy, eating a full meal and everything. Silly, yes, but frustrating, oh heck yeah"

lingling40hrs,fd7kt8v,t3_ek43wr,1578206045.0,oh..so it’s me
TrueOffMyChest,fct3p80,t3_eikqaa,1577932067.0,"I feel this. I was with a friend last night and her poor dog was terrified all night. And as I’m writing this, people are still lighting fireworks and I’m so worried my cat won’t be ok. She’s scared by loud noises."
TrueOffMyChest,fcon890,t3_ei7lbu,1577836470.0,Oh I saw your post too on AITA! Good for you! Have a great New Years!!
offmychest,fciyxxd,t1_fciypto,1577673179.0,I guess. Thank you for commenting though. I guess this is the best outlet to talk about stuff that weighs on me without anyone knowing it’s me. I’m gonna try talking to him soon about it. Have a nice night/day/afternoon
offmychest,fciy0z9,t1_fcixp5k,1577672541.0,"I definitely understand where you come from, and I have tried to put myself in his shoes to see where he’s coming from. But, I understand I don’t have much time left with him. Yet every moment, and it’s usually when I’m most happy, which is pretty uncommon nowadays, he has to bring it up. I know he doesn’t wanna leave me and my brothers and mom, but I just wish he wouldn’t bring it up on some of our best days. He even did it on Christmas..I can’t remember the last time my family was able to enjoy being all together and having a good time without him mentioning his inevitable doom. I’m sorry about going on a bit of a tangent. I hope you have a good new year"
lingling40hrs,fciujl0,t3_ehbkta,1577670146.0,"I only make small viola jokes from time to time, as a violinist, but my respect and love for the viola is no joke. It’s truly an amazing instrument and one of my friends plays it, and when he does, I’m in awe."
offmychest,fciu5zn,t1_fcitsl4,1577669887.0,"I have, multiple times. But thank you for the advice, I will try again soon. I know I’m not alone, but I know how painful it is, and I’m sorry that it’s happening to you too. Death is so unknown and even with how exposed I’ve been to it (I’ve lost a lot of people), it never gets easier. I’m scared to see him go. I hope you have a good new year, and your grandma as well"
offmychest,fcittt4,t1_fcitl5j,1577669659.0,"I’m so sorry for you loss, it’s understandable to feel happy that they are rid of their pain. Losing someone is extremely hard. I’ve already lost so many people, but never someone as close to me like that. I hope that you two had a wonderful life, and may the new year bring you joy"
AmItheAsshole,fcaavn8,t3_egrws9,1577565834.0,"My family does this too! With all of us being minors, my parents cash them but we know that fair is fair and don’t complain if someone gets more. My eldest brother got $100, I got $15. It’s fair because it’s his tickets vs mine. NTA"
AmItheAsshole,fal41mw,t3_e9gfnw,1576178037.0,"My best friend watched her mom die. It was hard on her, but she wanted to be with her when she took her last breath. She was 15. You are definitely NTA. They deserved to be there, and I bet your daughter was happy to know she was surrounded by loved ones."
