EOOD,ff6qtuv,t1_ff6dvgc,1579632959.0,"I started to feel a slight reduction after the first week. Nothing huge. But it just kept getting better and better from there, less and less problems with anxiety and depression... the key is consistency. 

I really love and enjoy weightlifting, and I look forward to my workouts and improving my lifts, so it’s easier for me to stay motivated doing something I am excited about. It also has improved my confidence; every time I finish a workout, I feel a sense of accomplishment. Give it a try!"
fatlogic,ff6lp9p,t1_ff6j2ow,1579629870.0,"In my experience, a breast exam is done by your doctor during an appointment, while a mammogram is a separate appointment and done by a radiology person.

That said, I’m not entirely sure how the tech would properly position you in the machine to get the pictures if you leave your shirt on. That thing gets really tight and close up to you... why risk missing something? And there is no way you’d be leaving clothing on if you have to get a biopsy done."
EOOD,ff6aanp,t3_erge7t,1579622791.0,"Lifting weights helped me a lot. I started doing StrongLifts 5x5 last summer, it’s a beginner routine. You do 3 exercises 3 times a week. Takes 30-45 minutes each time."
EOOD,ff6a2ky,t3_erskn6,1579622646.0,"You will lose weight even if you eat 50 calories less each day. It will take longer to lose weight, but it will happen. Maybe just try tracking your daily intake for a while without restricting your calories so you can get a better idea of how much you’re eating every day, and then set your goals from there. 

Choose something that you can maintain long term. If it’s 50 or 100 calories less than what you’re currently eating, that’s still progress. I think it’s better to set a smaller deficit that you can stick to, rather than trying a big one like 1000 calories right away. For some people, that can lead to binge eating and could sabotage your progress. So it’s okay to start small. You can always increase (or decrease) your deficit goal as you go along. The most important thing is consistency, so set a goal you can stick to. You can do this!"
1200isplenty,ff66hd6,t3_erqv1c,1579620294.0,"I have a Blaze and it works well for me. I track my calories in/out and it lines up almost exactly with what the scale tells me. 

If you have a Scheels near you, you can buy the Fitbit there and return it later, I believe. Scheels will accept returns at any time in the future if you bought the item from them (and have a receipt). Their return policy is awesome."
PSMF,ff638nv,t1_feimp9k,1579618024.0,"Thanks! I did call, and they said it was fine; they need the liquid to be ‘clear’ because anything colored or solid will obstruct the camera from getting good pictures. They said even some colored beverages are ok, as long as it isn’t red or purple. Apparently, these colors can look like blood once in your small intestine. 

However, if anyone else is having this procedure and is wondering about using the clear protein drinks, it’s always best to call the doctors office and make sure it is okay; otherwise you risk having to repeat this test which isn’t particularly fun to do."
PSMF,ff5zm5m,t1_ff4ua73,1579615259.0,Maybe a protein shake can help. Check the nutrition info and make sure it will fit your macros.
1200isplenty,ff3v33a,t3_erhitg,1579549495.0,"I’ve been lifting since last summer and I followed keto and made decent strength gains. My primary goal was strength rather than building visible muscle but i definitely look more toned now. I’m trying a recomp myself called PSMF, basically I’m eating 1.25g protein per lb of lean body mass, and it’s working okay so far. There’s a subreddit for it as well as a book called Rapid Fat Loss by Lyle McDonald if you’re interested. There are also other “cutting” diets you could try for recomp. I don’t think you’ll gain a lot of muscle, but you will lose fat and retain what muscle you do have, and it will make you look like your muscles are bigger just because of the fat loss."
1200isplenty,ff18sg5,t1_ff0ok6s,1579476390.0,"For that, I do try to weigh the cooked meat before I put it into Cronometer so I can get more accurate nutrition information. I believe the app also has categories where you can specify if the ingredient is raw or cooked, and whether there is visible fat eaten (like for a steak or something)."
fatlogic,feyvw07,t1_feybkov,1579451075.0,The cooking oil screwed me up when I first started tracking. I was weighing everything except for that and couldn’t figure out why I wasn’t losing. So I just started weighing the bottle of oil before and after cooking. Much easier this way for me!
1200isplenty,fevim9t,t3_eqh3yf,1579397837.0,"When I’m cooking, I weigh all the ingredients (don’t forget to check the olive oil etc) and put them into a recipe in Cronometer. Then I weigh the portion of that recipe that I’m eating and it calculates all the nutrition info for me."
1200isplenty,fet2ers,t1_feovcnr,1579371205.0,"Try glucose tablets. You can buy them at CVS or Walgreens. Each one is 4g of carbs, 15 calories, and you’ll burn that off during your workout. They help me a lot! I actually bought the travel size container and keep it in my gym bag so even if I decide to eat all of them, there are only 10 of them total. I keep a bigger container at home. They help a lot with energy!"
1200isplenty,fet1xbb,t1_feodatj,1579371045.0,What I do is use glucose tablets before and during my workouts. I keep them in my gym bag and I only allow myself to use them when I’m physically in the gym. They help me a lot with energy!
1200isplenty,fet0xjs,t1_feobks9,1579370836.0,"For me it was useful because it forced me to seek out new foods and try new recipes that I probably wouldn’t otherwise have tried. I started regularly eating spinach, salmon, asparagus, avocados, other stuff that I honestly didn’t eat before. But I basically ate like a garbage truck before doing low carb so YMMV"
fatlogic,feszxy7,t1_feok9nd,1579370521.0,"I’ve been there too. Hang in there, you’ll get through this!"
90dayfianceuncensored,feokg48,t1_feoiwx8,1579301452.0,I want to punch you!
fatlogic,feogxsb,t1_feo76kd,1579299975.0,"I recently read that it may be related to “cold muscles” — when you’re exercising at the gym or whatever, you probably take some time to warm up first. But most people will not warm up before going up the stairs, so your muscles are “cold” and it feels more difficult. Dunno how true that is, though!"
fatlogic,feoffmu,t1_fen36hl,1579299442.0,"I did this to kickstart my diet. But my intent was basically spending so much money on that crap would guilt me into not cheating on it, and I definitely did not! But yeah, it’s basically useless otherwise."
fatlogic,feo147t,t1_feniwb5,1579293621.0,"Do you exercise at all? I used to use food as a coping mechanism in the same way, but over the course of the past year, I’ve kinda retrained my brain and thought patterns by going to the gym regularly. It’s a lot of work but definitely worth it. Weightlifting has helped me a lot!"
