Maybe bubble in your own random string out of a list of smaller randomized strings utilized in such a way no two could duplicate, end result looking much like the new wifi passwords. Later search the list of strings. String not associated with vote content except on ballot, which is not associated with you. Yes it would be possible to connect the two, but you would require actual ballot and to know who searched for the string, which could be avoided with downloadable string list.

It was only 15 or so years ago I thought about it, but I definitely always thought it could be very useful. One of my ""if I ever had the ability to pursue I may look into it"" ideas.

New York City has a degraded water supply from the great lakes that needs serious repair. Then Elon Musk came out with his vacuum tunnel transport (which I'm not sure I like but could be shown wrong). I had a similar idea but only to keep superconductors cool for lossless power transmission nationwide from sunny desert solar areas, but I was going for small diameter directional drilling type thing. I live in an area where digging for commuter transport takes years for even a few miles. I think I did wonder about high pressure cutting jets but dismissed it for some reason. Ha, I remember wondering if glassification of soils/clay would be of any help for structure or something. But I probably had the idea to make them closer to the surface.

Sketchup - a free to use 3d modeling program was what I learned on. It is probably one of the easyst to learn but it's not talored for much animation. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/ZRoXQCY.jpg) is one of my first renders I made with it after maybe 20 hours. Only the thing on the back of the bike is mine, everything else I just downloaded, so you don't have to do everything to make it look ok. (it was for some green design competition in 2010ish).

I may whip up a version of mine on there tomorrow or next day to show you. It will be a simplistic model of a very basic idea and im not sure I wanna spend hours on it. But I really really really like to go for simple ""fewer moving parts"" kinda design so it should be easy. But IDK about tunnel structure, one idea might be easy to model."
Inventions,febw4rp,t3_eo9rgs,1578963450.0,"I replied to your other post but deleted it probably before you read it.

I also had the same idea that a core should be cut as opposed to the current method and using hole saws often was probably part of the inspiration. My idea/machine is very VERY simple and really the only similarly between ours it the core method.

I feel as though your machine is trying to be more than it needs to be and as a result, overly complicated. It's okay to think up a complicated machine, we use many complicated machines daily BUT if your trying to get people interested in this idea, complicated mechanical details and walls of descriptive ideas may not work as well for the general public as much as visualizations, animations or even a small prototype.

It is something I've thought about years ago so I don't remember all the details. I really don't think it's would be as easy as you're making it sound. You can't just throw one down and start digging. Geology would be a huge concern as it's not just a slab of solid stone down there. Water, gasses, oils, faults heat. If you don't immediately support the tunnel after cut you get cave-ins. (I think you may have had a thing for coating the walls but I don't think it was structural idk)

Solid stone would work great, it just isn't everywhere.

We both came to the same two conclusions that easy/quick tunnel excavation could be very helpful in ways and coring may be the key to achieving that. Since I have spent a lot of time in my life thinking up ideas i often run into someone with a similar idea and it's kinda nice. But if ya wanna get people interested in something like a big machine I'd probably suggest a video. Many people don't generally think in an engineering kinda way and being able to see it helps immensely.

Also, after reading this and looking at your post history I'm wondering if DMT doesn't have something to do with your ""inspiration"" universe story!

Anyway, I might seem like I'm being negative but even with my own ideas I might just stop and think of all the things that might go wrong, not to be negative but to redesign it into something that works better. Ohh, I could maybe doodle/describe my own machine if you have any interest in that."

atoptics,fe8var1,t1_fe6vu0f,1578931390.0,"The atmospheric conditions are rare, and I think there have been two or maybe three times these clouds have appeared in Norway this year, the event I'm talking about was over several days or a week. Almost all of the pics are from Jan 8th I think, posted the 9th. A few are several days earlier.

I think it's more rare in the northern hemisphere but primarily a winter thing in the north or south.

If you've never sat up in a nice tree on a summer day with the wind blowing around I might suggest it, but on the limbs."

Knowyourmeme.com could help with understanding if it applies.

I'm not sure your asking about memes or also the visual presentation of information. I personally like the way it's all laid out.
