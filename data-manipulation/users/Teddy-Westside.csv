AskReddit,fffhb5w,t1_ffegd97,1579883952.0,"Was the hostel the Wombat? I was there late last year and my Australian friend and I were in the bar downstairs and happened to meet these two girls. We find out they’re going on a walking tour the next day and they invite us to go with them. So after a long night out my buddy and I get up and are almost like screw it, let’s not go but finally decide to go. We’re on this walking tour and he happens to look over and see his old roommate from boarding school back in Australia. He hadn’t seen that guy in like 10 years and they spent the entirety of the walking tour catching up. It blew me away that the only reason we even were on that tour was because we happened to run into those girls from the night prior"

In this world the police won’t even speak to you if you don’t have a grain, so while it’s optional and not technically required, unless you have one you’re not really a member of society in some ways and are denied certain things like police service, maybe even travel since at the customs / airport checkpoint the main guy had to replay his last two weeks or so for the future-TSA agent.

AskReddit,fc2gmf5,t3_eft9mt,1577359120.0,"I had a 4+ year relationship end earlier this year due to her being attracted to her new coworker and leaving me to explore a relationship with him. I was pretty broken up about it, but eventually started to realize it wasn’t the end of the world. I was finally ready to dip my toe in the dating pool. I signed up for a couple apps and started swiping for the first time ever, which was pretty fun and exciting to try out. I got a match with a girl a few miles away, and sent her a message around 10 PM and went to sleep. The next morning I decided to check if she’d written back and when I loaded the app I could see the little chat icon, and waited for the spin icon to stop and everything to load. When it did, her chat bubble disappeared. My first match ever, and the first girl I’ve spoken to romantically since my ex and I split up had unmatched me. All I could do was laugh and delete the app."
