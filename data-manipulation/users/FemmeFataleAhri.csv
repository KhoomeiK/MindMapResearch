She's in her 30s and posted something along the lines of she's bipolar and I commented saying have been diagnosed? If you remotely think you may be go, find out. Otherwise you look like a attention seeking whore."

offmychest,fdppbyp,t1_fdpoeuu,1578635489.0,"This! But I will add that there are conditions that can prevent you from being able to have penetrable sex. Once you get comfortable with someone and trust them to try again, if it still is uncomfortable go to a doctor. Granted your first time will have times of uncomfort, but it shouldn't be anywhere near as bad once relaxed and you get used to it. Don't be afraid to talk to your doctors!"

buffy,fdnmw2w,t1_fdlwgs2,1578589110.0,"All slayers are activated forever. If a girl or woman could/couldve been a slayer, she will have the power to be a slayer. I think this might change at some point in the comics (something about the magic seed or world seed) but that is what happened in the comics and what happens to Buffy next. I've never read them, but I cheated and looked it up awhile back."
buffy,fdnluxb,t3_em42ta,1578588506.0,"Hush doesn't age well due to technology, but the premise is still the same. There would be mass hysteria to a certain degree."
buffy,fdnlkih,t1_fdnldpn,1578588338.0,"Ahh, sweet I couldn't remember! Still explains a few things. Time period being a MAJOR player and the fact that Buffy was very mature for her age (who woilsnt be after having the entire world's fate rest on your shoulders). Plus, most men don't really mature until well after 25 (I think closer to 30 or something?)."
buffy,fdnkrxj,t1_fdnf3af,1578587867.0,"Oh, wasn't he rather young when he was turned? I don't think he was over 21 at the time of his turning. Which can explain some things."
buffy,fdnkepb,t1_fdlwiym,1578587650.0,"She was rash, as most teens are. Granted everything was going to hell in a hand basket, but there could've been major repercussions (other than releasing Angelus, which is quite literally one of the worst). You gotta think of the double intention here. This show happened in the ninety/early 00s, when sex was very much taboo, and teens having sex was very very ignored. Buffy went through what most girls go through. She was in love, and Angel loved her, then lost his soul and became a giant tool (how some dudes literally just use a girl to get in her pants and then treat her like total garbage afterwards). They addressed this in a light  that shows that it wasn't her fault. Rash decision or other wise, she could not have predicted this outcome.

When Giles says rash I do believe he's meaning ""not thought out"" or ""heat of the moment"". What about protection? Did they use condoms? What if he had some mystical std (I mean aside from the whole soul thing)? How about some weird magical pregnancy? There were things that could've happened that could very well wrecked  Buffy's entire life, that all boiled down to the MAYBE  5 seconds she took to make a decision that could (and ultimately would) change her life forever. Instead of making her feel even worse about a split second decision, he reaffirmed her and made her feel loved and safe. Which speaks volumes, he addressed that yes, it was rash, but nothing is wrong with it doing it with someone you love and who you thought loved you."
buffy,fdnj2ms,t1_fdmnbpd,1578586857.0,Yes Angelus is released in season two after Buffy and him do the deed.
buffy,fdnj0a7,t1_fdly0b0,1578586817.0,"Ooh. Good episodes all of them, but if I remember correctly one of my fav is I only have eyes for you (it's been awhile and I'm going to revisit it soon, but is that the one where they get poessed by the two spirits of Sunnydale high?)."

When you care for someone, turning tail like a scared child helps no one. Illness because wellness when we replace I with we."
AskMen,fdjhsvq,t1_fdjhlzh,1578471430.0,"Sounds like she's currently IN the episode. Which unfortunately, you can't help until she wants the help, or she's just being stubborn.
