1. You were in an uncomfortable situation when all these guys started showing up in your room. You stayed in that room. What you should have done is immediately walked out, gone down to reception and explained the situation. Then you should have contacted your boss, saying that you knew you said you were okay with sharing a room, but this guy has crossed a line. By not doing this, you are partially responsible for that uncomfortable and potentially dangerous situation.
2. This guy is TA for having exactly ZERO respect for your personal space and boundaries, especially since he didn't know you. Who knows who these people were that he was bringing back, who knows what his plans were or weren't, and what a disgusting creeper he is. Also, you didn't make him lose his job, HE made himself lose his job.
3. Your boss put your company at risk by not further insisting that you change rooms immediately. He never should have accepted you saying you didn't mind. This was a serious liability concern and he should've handled it better. Also, him saying he can't do anything now because you didn't change rooms is a stupid thing on his part, because as a supervisor he still carries responsibility.
4. Your coworkers are also AH's for saying that nothing really happened. Just because you weren't assaulted violently, doesn't mean that nothing happened. A lot happened."

Yes, your mom needs to be your mom. And you guys are teenagers. But it is the job of all of you to take care of each other. You've done a good job helping your mom. 

I think you should work with your sister to get your mom out of bed, and the four of you should go out somewhere. Doesn't have to be fancy, could be for a walk around the block, to a park, or a friend's house. But the first step outside will be helpful for all of you to feel like a family again."

That being said, even though Lucy brought her kid against your wishes, you decided to be nice and let them stay. That did not in any way dissolve Lucy of her responsibility to watch HER CHILD.

mildlyinteresting,fec8a9a,t1_febzy0w,1578968387.0,Oh the owner is fully aware. They just don't care.
mildlyinteresting,febteiu,t1_febqy08,1578962494.0,"No one has a key. She's just stupid. I kid you not, her thought was that she wanted the laundry facilities all to herself, so she would lock us out to keep us from using them, although that means locking herself out too.

Good thing my mom knows how to pop a lock with a screwdriver! I dunno WHY my mom knows how to do that but, whatever!"
mildlyinteresting,febt76l,t1_febrzis,1578962402.0,"Oh yes. This is just the tip of the iceberg.

\*Used to leave her dog alone in apartment everyday for 18 hours, let the dog crap all over her apartment, created lovely smell.

\*Plugged up the overflow in her bath tub, left tub filled with water while she went away on holiday for Thanksgiving. Water leaked through our bathroom ceiling, made the ceiling cave in on Thanksgiving morning.

\*Lets her kid run back and forth through the apartment, creating fantastic noise.

\*Once left her 6 year old son with a 2 year old alone in the apartment for several hours. When we realized the kids were alone up there we called the police. They investigated, but this woman had come home by the time they got there. She was investigated by the state.

\*Domestic violence with her past partners. Does drugs.

So much fun."
mildlyinteresting,febs5g6,t1_febl8ps,1578962065.0,We truly keep to ourselves as much as we can possibly think of. This upstairs neighbor is a special kind of trouble and entitled and we're done. We've made numerous complaints to the landlord. And I mean NUMEROUS.
mildlyinteresting,febrkjz,t1_febmmqd,1578961899.0,"Maybe but, when I came home and saw this I couldn't stop laughing.

After having to pop the lock open with a screwdriver earlier today, I think my mom was so done with the behavior of the nimrod upstairs, so this was the first thing she thought of."
mildlyinteresting,febrakg,t1_febow4p,1578961824.0,"No, it's supposed to be unlocked at all times, so that we all can use the washer and dryer, as stipulated in our lease. This upstairs neighbor was locking the door because she wants the laundry setup all to herself, because she's entitled like that.

Trying to get keys for all four apartments from the landlord would be exhausting. But it's not necessary anyway since we all have individual storage units in the basement which we have our own locks for. The basement door is inside the building, anyway, so unless someone were to break in through the crazy heavy exterior backdoor, there's literally no reason for that door to be locked."

I think that is the right thing to do. The fact that you have to block him, means that if you unblock him, he would immediately try to contact you. Says everything about him and his behavior, ya know what I mean?

I dunno if OP is aware of what he's doing or not. But I also hope he stops bothering his daughter."
AmItheAsshole,fe6jsb8,t1_fe6j7uq,1578893192.0,"His post clearly says ""But she always says she doesn't want anything to do with me."" meaning that he has tried to contact her multiple times, and she has said in response to every time he's contacted her, that she wants nothing to do with him. *Reading comprehension*."
AmItheAsshole,fe6itl6,t1_fe6inui,1578892264.0,"I'm basing my judgment of you on my basic sense of empathy. You may want to employ it, next time you are considering harassing your daughter."
AmItheAsshole,fe6iqwm,t1_fe6igwt,1578892194.0,"It's selfish indeed. Also really creepy.

I'm so sorry your dad did that to you on your birthday. What a disturbingly invasive thing to do."
AmItheAsshole,fe6hpa4,t3_enz6yf,1578891236.0,"NTA. Coming from someone who cut a toxic, alcoholic, abusive and stupid dad out of my life, I promise you are doing the right thing for your life. Good luck to you, I hope everything works out ;)"
AmItheAsshole,fe6heh1,t3_enz8k6,1578890971.0,"YTA. You disrespected his intelligence, and you still want to fix things between you two? Honey, you can't fix this one. Let him go."
AmItheAsshole,fe6h2la,t1_fe6gmqy,1578890682.0,"Been there. It truly is anxiety-inducing. Thankfully my dad stopped years ago and gave up, but still, it wasn't exactly fun while it was still happening."
AmItheAsshole,fe6h0dt,t3_enz8k9,1578890629.0,"YTA. My dad put me through similar things. I have been in your daughter's shoes. My recommendation to you is that you stop bothering her before you do something that compromises her mental health more, or lands you in court. What you are doing is not healthy, and you need to stop hurting her. She has the right to live her life freely without you."
minecraftsuggestions,fe6fdtb,t1_fe6f8iz,1578889242.0,"I dunno, I think taking advantage of wandering traders in the early game, and stealing their leads every time they spawn in, is a lot of fun."
minecraftsuggestions,fe6f5gb,t1_fe5tpxh,1578889054.0,"You don't have to kill them for leads. Just put a boat next to the llamas. When the llama gets sucked into the boat, the lead disconnects from them. Yahoo, free lead, and no dead wandering traders!"
minecraftsuggestions,fe6ezdh,t1_fe4fxn1,1578888914.0,"It would be pretty easy to prove them wrong, because trolls would spam the chat. Anybody who defeats the wither, say, 10 times in one real-world day, is full of bologna.

The ender dragon and wither require resources to spawn them. That takes time. There are health bars, sounds and some chat messages too (if I'm not mistaken) that appear on servers when someone is fighting one of these bosses.

The fact that the members of this specific anarchy server, don't want to fight these bosses because they don't want to spam the chat with false credit, says that there likely aren't many, if any, trolls on this server."
