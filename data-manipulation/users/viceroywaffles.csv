We were gifted some silicone bags and kitchen towels. You're right. They're so helpful. Idk about the bidet purely because it's an old prewar apartment and I'm not 100%  sure if the toilet is compatible but you've tickled my brain. I'll look into it and see if I can finagle something. 

Thank you so much. n.n"

ZeroWaste,ff55nbe,t1_ff55g2b,1579580920.0,Blanket ban. Apparently someone tried and failed at composting a few years back and they had to get the place tented. It scarred the owner for life. Ever since then there's monthly bug inspections. But hey the rent's cheap!
AskReddit,felhuwg,t1_felfh1b,1579222536.0,This is an underrated comment. Qiviut was exactly what came to my mind too.

Marriage,fcte4fr,t3_eit5ym,1577940365.0,"Start small. 

Option 1: If it's a decent day declare that you feel cooped up inside and ask her to walk with you. Go around the block. Lavish her with attention and say how nice it was just getting out with her. Studies show when you're around greenery and outdoors and sun you tend to perk up. Discretely try to turn this into a once a week habit. Then increase in frequency. Increase in distance. 

Option 2: Tell her you feel stressed lately and want to do yoga but feel embarrassed/silly doing it alone. Do a small beginner 5 minute intro online. Increase in time and frequency. Partnered yoga is even more fun. 

Option 3: Who does the shopping? Organize the fridge and pantry such that healthy options are at your fingertips but junkier food takes much more effort.

Do these small things for a month. Then compliment her on her progress. You're quoting how you lost x pounds (good job!) But for me at least it was MUCH harder for me to lose weight than it ever was for my husband. Even when we had the exact same plan. What kept me going was how my clothes felt. So when I lost weight and went down a few dress sizes my husband was there to whistle and cover me in kisses. My favorite was when he announced we needed to go shopping because he wanted a new beautiful dress to show off his beautiful wife in when he took her on a date. 

If you start too much all at once it won't stick. But if you discretely frame the exercises as HER helping YOU then her motivation to exercise switches from one of self loathing to one of love and affection for you."
Marriage,fctclb9,t3_ei7aut,1577939048.0,"We get waaay into gardening in the spring. Oh boy do we suck at it but it's cathartic and the razzing is hysterical. Buy seeds from dollar store. 4 for $1. They're rolling out the pots and dirt and seeds soon. Name your plants. Measure them. Chart them. Have your kids take bets on who can grow the tallest plant. Eat them. Profit. But do it together. One of my happiest memories is listening to my husband prattle on for 15 minutes about the merits of rosemary over dill and then reneging that and going back and switching out the seeds. Dates are really just times you set aside to focus on each other. Plus everytime you see the flowers in the windowsill, you'll think of each other and smile. 

Other cheap date ideas, community college productions of plays and music recitals. Walking outside and picking up litter (with gloves!) Blowing bubbles. Coloring. Play jumprope. Be young."

AskReddit,fbv8g5x,t3_eekte9,1577127154.0,"Archery. I love archery. But since becoming visually impaired I can't drive to the range or see where the arrow lands. While blind archery IS a thing, money for spotters (the guy who basically tells me where my arrow went) and equipment and transportation just isn't there. I've learned to live with the other indignities of low vision but gosh do I miss archery."
