dogs,fe0kx41,t1_fdwk892,1578815249.0,"That’s pretty dangerous and irresponsible. Your dog should be leashed and under control when you’re in a public place. I would be so mad if an unleashed dog came up to me and my dog when we were on a walk, especially if that dog tried to aggressively “play” with my dog and would not back off. In most every city, it is also against the law to have a dog off-leash unless in a designated off-leash dog park, so there’s that too."

BanPitBulls,fdf6496,t1_fdesdbp,1578354173.0,"The puppy is only 3 months old, that would be really early to neuter it. Our vet is recommending neutering our puppy when she hits 6 months, and even that is a little early from what I’ve read. I think it has something to do with growth plates developing."
