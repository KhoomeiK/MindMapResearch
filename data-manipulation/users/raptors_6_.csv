Filmmakers,fepighu,t3_eqbpv5,1579321331.0,"**Hey Filmmakers community! This is a project my best friend and I are working on. We are looking to get better with each video. We would appreciate your feedback!  This is our process.  We come up with an idea together and go through the funniest ways to do it.  Then we improv it.  What I've learned so far, is that we need to do it more than once.  I'm an editor and my best friend is an actor, so we are both learning the technical aspects.  I think I also need to focus on giving him direction.  If you are able to give us any feedback, we will apply it to the next round.  We got some great tips last time.  Thanks!**"
improv,fepfqdj,t3_eq082v,1579319366.0,"Idea - write a bunch of random thoughts on a post it notes, and have two people in a relationship in a scene.  They need to pick up the post it notes and incorporate the dialouge into the scene."
lgbt,fep7xsa,t3_eq0uqi,1579314149.0,Looks so good!
improv,fem3sg6,t3_epu7a6,1579238798.0,Okay - I’m going to recommend my own improv I do with my best friend.  Let me know what you think! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a2EL6YksJvY

comedy,feftzoh,t3_eoobzn,1579065145.0,nope.
improv,feftvxo,t3_eow6sj,1579065055.0,Just a thought - but my friend improvs on camera and I film him and we make fun videos and post them on YouTube.  Maybe you could start by doing that and then inviting people to guest in them?

AmItheAsshole,fdrwzxj,t3_emx2ka,1578690960.0,"YTA -  ""women extend their hand, I go in for the hug"" . You are missing a huge social cue.  If anyone extends their hand, you shake their hand.  I'm spelling this out for you cause I think you might need it - You Do NOT go in for a hug."
AmItheAsshole,fdrw5vm,t3_emx6bs,1578690675.0,"NAH - Situations changes, and I definitely don't think your an asshole for asking every 6 months."
SuicideWatch,fdj8eqo,t3_elj38e,1578461405.0,"Hey, I was very overweight as a child.  People were so unkind to me, and I started listening to what they were saying.  I thought of myself as lower than everybody in the human race.  Here is a quote that helped me ‘The first thought we think is what we are conditioned to think, but the thoughts that come after are your true character’. I couldn’t replace the first thought, and sometimes 25+ years later I still can’t.  But all the other thoughts after are mine, and I work everyday on finding something good about myself.  I hope you can start, because honestly, I lost the weight and realized it didn’t make a difference.  Mean people are just mean.  If it weren’t for the weight, it would be because you don’t wear the right clothes, and on and on and on.  You do you!  Please do something nice for yourself, you deserve it.  Wishing you the very best."
