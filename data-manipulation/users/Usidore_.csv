They are a small business, OP is acting as a manager as well as an owner. And if you really think taking aside an under performing employee and seeing if there is a blocker for them performing well - before firing them, then I don't know what to tell you. You'd have a very high turnover of staff"
AmItheAsshole,ffc58mw,t1_ffc51q8,1579791824.0,">Ya know...except the fact he was getting fired.

Did you even read the sentence you quoted from me? Not all employees get fired because they aren't doing a good job.Sometimes you need to make cutbacks. In my own company, 4 people were fired and the CEO insisted that he would hire them back as soon as the means were there (which he then did) because they were so great. The resources just weren't there to justify their roles.

>Can't give a shit about your employees if you go under due to shit employees not doing their job.

If you threaten to go under, yes let them go, but it takes a shitty manager to not at least try and find out why there is an issue and see if there is a solution first. Having to recruit and screen applicants to hire a new employee is also a potential drain on a company"
AmItheAsshole,ffc4ra2,t1_ffc378d,1579791500.0,"> an employee that was determined not to be doing the job he is contractually obligated to do?

Nothing in the OP suggests that was the case. It could have been cutbacks for all we know. 

And I would argue that a manager is managing people, not just numbers. A good manager does give a shit about their employees, and that includes being empathetic to stresses you are causing them (whether they deserve it or not)."

I go through a very similar everyday experience as a dwarf. People gawk at me and film me. It's by far the most infuriating and humiliating thing that people do, and I have no reservations about telling such people to fuck off, flipping them off, or glaring into their camera in order to regain some kind of semblance of agency in what's happening. I understand what it's like, and because of that, I really don't think you could possibly believe you are the asshole in this scenario."
