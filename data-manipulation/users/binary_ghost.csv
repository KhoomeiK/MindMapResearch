therewasanattempt,fcwiy1n,t1_fcvkggk,1578026871.0,"That has nothing to do with the fact men can be drafted against their will to the military; which is some places is more likely than others. Women do not, and never have had this worry. That is why this is moot in the context of the dudes statement. Homeboy didnt say anything about who should or shouldnt serve, who is more capable, etc. Again, he is talking about the draft."
