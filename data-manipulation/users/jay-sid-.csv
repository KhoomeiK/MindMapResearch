depression,ffha087,t1_ffh7nt7,1579927471.0,Thanks :( . I know I’m not the only one but it’s hard to remember that
depression,ffgyxtl,t3_etknkp,1579918657.0,"I feel alone even when I’m with people . Even when someone can relate to me it doesn’t help . None of it matters , I’m alone in my own mind"
depression,femdg75,t3_epvtca,1579249841.0,Slave away until we are 65 and then we get to retire and enjoy our life when we can barely walk . Love it
nutrition,fe6nk4i,t1_fe6lenv,1578897123.0,"Thank you . I wasn’t even trying to be a dick or anything , I’m saying this from experience . Unbelievable"
carnivore,fe6ebmg,t3_envbjr,1578888379.0,I was so low for 2 years suffering from an auto immune disease that no I don’t get jealous when I see people eating that stuff . I much prefer eating this way and almost think they should be the jealous ones as I feel better than they probably do . Also I think after awhile you can afford to have a cheat day . I do strict carnivore keto but if I’m going out with friends once a week or every other week it’s okay to have some pizza .. yeah i guess It sucks when traveling or telling people why you’re eating this way but you should be more proud of it . It helped reversed some serious health problems for you
depression,fe5bzsz,t3_enqkiy,1578867499.0,No But i Can take a deep breath outside and depending on the weather different memories come flashing through my mind . Really weird feeling
nutrition,fe5bftd,t1_fe5ab70,1578867316.0,"Lol you’ve been lied too , anti nutrients are not healthy in any way and yes they’re very toxic . Look up sally k Norton’s work ."
nutrition,fe5886r,t1_fe4uo50,1578866501.0,There’s also a lot of oxalates . Which binds to iron in your body and pulls it out . Extremely toxic
