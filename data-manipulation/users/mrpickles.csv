The biggest carbon sink on the planet is the ocean.  The long term carbon cycle deposits carbon absorbed by the surface of the ocean into ocean sediment and rock at the bottom.  The more CO2 in the air, the more energy the earth absorbs from the sun, the warmer the oceans.  The warmer the oceans, the less CO2 they absorb.  Once the ice caps have finished melting, this counterweight will cease to function.  Continued warming will result in evaporation of the oceans, which will result in lower sea levels, which results in decreased surface area exposed to the atmosphere, which results in decreased CO2 absorption by the oceans.

I don't see anything that will stop these feedbacks once they get going.  I would like to know more about how PETM recovered.  I'm afraid this time is different.

> Wave particle duality and the double slit experiment are absolutely mindblowing and saying ""observation just changes the particle,"" doesn't do it justice. Not only does observation collapse the wave function, but a particle somehow knows when it will be observed in the future and acts accordingly. This was demonstrated with the delayed choice quantum eraser experiment, which is definitely worth checking out!

They think they can continue to curry favor and pull the strings, but they fail to realize their undermining of Congressional power to the Executive is cutting off their own legs.  The day the Senate finally tries to rebuff Trump may come too late, when they're own precedent has left Congress no mechanism to enforce it's powers.  Trump will simply cry executive privilege or emergency powers, DOJ will balk and then investigate congressmen, and SCOTUS will rubber stamp it all.  It's already happening.  GOP think they can control it.  But soon, perhaps already, they can't."
