He disgusts me. I hope she turned his nasty ass down hard, laughed her open mouthed guffaw at him and then made some hyper-intelligent burn that he knew was really bad, but he wasn't really sure how or why and that just made it worse because the only thing that he could semi-intelligently mutter was ""I know you are, but what am I?""
