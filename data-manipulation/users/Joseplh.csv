- different scanning tools could include, strong passive, directional, and rotating radar ""pings"".

- use of a compass or other navigational tools are very important.  Perhapse contextual tools would be best for when relevant.  A compass at or below the surface, GPS coordinates above in atmosphere.  Finally solar coordinates, when in space, based on the sun/center of mass in the system.

- For junk minerals, add a button where the ship sorts the materials at the cost of time/fuel.  This would balance time vs cost efficency.

- Considering that CIG wants to procedurally generate whole planets, I would like the density of minable materials to appear in pockets as opposed to wide spread over a desert.  Where and the density of the pockets can still be heavily factored in generation.

- Perhapse with the addition of Crusader and other gas giants, add a ""volitiales"" resource where it can be sold/refined, or used as emergency fuel at 10% the efficency."

UpliftingNews,ff34jsn,t1_ff2y4bn,1579533498.0,"From.my understanding there are two/3 big factors that need to be addressed that inflates the cost.  First is malpractice lawsuits, lawsuits cost millions per suit and there is insurance for doctors that costs a fortune to protect themselves.  Second/third is mandatory emergency room services and non-payment.  Debt unpaid is offset onto those who can with inflated costs."
UpliftingNews,ff33wlz,t1_ff2du1s,1579533032.0,"You can do exactly the same thing the church did.  I forget the technical term, but you could negotiate with the hospital to pay off someone else's debt for a fraction of what they owed.  I do think it is legally a charitable donation.  The only advantage a church has over you is money and manpower to negotiate even lower pennies on the dollar."
UpliftingNews,ff33ilq,t1_ff2o1u6,1579532744.0,"It is unlikely they did.  13mil is the debt forgiven, not the amount paid.  Churches that do this usually can get debt paid for pennies on the dollar.  They negotiate with the hospital and can convince them to drop late fees, interest, etc. In exchange for a large sum."
UpliftingNews,ff33a3x,t1_ff2omvc,1579532562.0,"Also do not be afraid to negotiate.  Most hospitals jack up the price to compensate for others who still owe them.  If you can pay only a portion, it is surprising the number of hospitals willing to take less than chase after for scraps.  The benifit to this is that it wipes the debt for less and you do not get hit on you credit score."
UpliftingNews,ff32ybs,t1_ff2u0w8,1579532315.0,"They do, but rarely is it this publicized.  It is also usually smaller contributions for congregation members and soup kitchens.  There are not many churches in the first place with millions to spend.

On a side note: although it is not mentioned in this article, rarely is the amount of debt forgiven the same as what is actually paid.  Churches act like unions and often can negotiate fees and penalties away when paying off debt through collective bargaining."
news,ff31vr3,t1_ff2ofmr,1579531494.0,"I did not look too deeply into the data, so you may be right.  

I would at the moment consider them accurate.  Different years should not make much of a difference, unless there was a massive crisis, like it is noted for Grenada.  Grenada was just hit prior to the record taken, which boosted the homeless population.  Beyond that, population should remain fairly static year after year.

Other factors, like you mentioned are the definition used.  Russia by example is noted to have a very low official number, but there is a note that some external reports state differently.  It gets trickier with other countries, because of edge cases, so unless provided an example of the difference in definition, I would consider them comparable between countries at the moment."
news,ff3105w,t1_ff2pqvt,1579530790.0,"Just want to make a note here.  I just used the percentage given, because I felt it was the most fair comparison.  California alone makes up over half the homeless population in the US, despite having only ~12% of the overall population.  I have spoken to many homeless people who have specifically moved to California, because the weather is nice year round in addition to generous social systems.  I  made the assumption that the same trend might be true in Europe."
news,ff2al5s,t1_ff28jas,1579498795.0,"Just going by the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_homeless_population) page.

* UK: 00.46%
* Germany: 00.37%
* France: 00.21%
* Greece: 00.18%
* United States: 00.17%
* Denmark: 00.11%
* Canada: 00.09%

Looking at the big/notable countries, Europe has a worse homeless percentage, on average, compared to the United States.  Of the countries with lower percentages in Europe, I noticed a trend in the statistics, either the country is far to the north(cold)(Finland: 0.099%) or relatively economically poor(Poland: 0.08%).  I suspect that many impoverished people in Europe tend to migrate to countries were there are more generous social systems along side better weather.  This would explain why countries like Germany has over double the homeless rate of the US or even compared to their neighbor Austria at 17%."

I do however understand the justification(albeit weak justification) in the details of the story as to why they fired her.  From here, ""The Supervisor who allowed her to leave work...\[also fired\]"", she got a call from a customer, she is representative of a bank as a call center worker, she then left, during work hours, to go help the person.  Had this been on their own time and not during work hours, this would have not made any red flags.  There are rules of behavior in employee contracts that state you should not go beyond your job description, because while on the clock they are representing that company.  While even though this case was for a good reason, they still violated that clause.  

I would bet that there is also more to the story, because this would not normally be a fire-able case.  Especially because the supervisor, who presumably gave permission was also fired..."

Likely one of the legitimate criticisms you alluded to is that the description of the article is filled with loaded words for clickbait.  For instance, ""...white Robots?..."" and ""...technological white may be racism."" uses specific racial colors.  

The true title of the article is far less incendiary, ""Robot racism? Yes, says a study that humans biases extend to robots.""  This does not call out a single color, gives a quick summary of the findings, and remains neutral."
news,fdobmse,t1_fdoa9ol,1578602247.0,"There was also no radio contact from the pilots, I suspect that the missile knocked out the radio and controls, most surface to air missiles are not designed to directly hit, but to explode in front of a plane and let the shrapnel do the damage as the plane flies through the cloud, this effectively turned the plane into an uncontrollable glider.  Like a paper air plane, it would curve towards the direction the plane was already turning, according to last radar contact.  If there was any control left, the first instinct for pilots are to find the safest place to land/crash, so the airport they just left is the most logical choice.  Either is possible"
