Seahawks,ffh21nl,t1_ffg956c,1579921000.0,"I think if we're talking purely about speed then yes you do see RBs starting to slow down in that 27-28 range.  They just tend to be much better at the game at that point than when they were 22-23 so they can remain very good backs.  


We can use Russ as an anecdotal example, since he's arguably the most successful long-term rushing QB.  His highest rushing yards ever was in 2014, when he was 26.  Even in 2017 when he led the team in rushing he didn't get close to the yards from his 2014 year."

The bank is in the wrong here.  Not the sheriff, who was likely choosing between doing something he didn’t want to do or putting his wife and kids on the street.

Hell you don’t even know the full context.  If I was a sheriff I’d *want* this to happen.  I’d set it up.  “Hey guys no way in hell am I evicting this woman but if I don’t try I’ll get fired and my family will end up on the street instead.  So I’m coming at X time.  I’ll be by myself.

nfl,fejqmjh,t1_feiynmc,1579183382.0,"Yes...I know not all teams perform in line with their DVOA predicted scores...my point is seattle DID.  Suggesting they performed as expected.

You literally say ""they were lucky to get to 11 wins"" while simultaneously admitting with a little extra luck they would've been at 13 wins.

As I've said twice already.  Here's my third time.  The best data we have says they performed as expected.  DVOA accounts for that luck, and says they ended up where they should have been.

Even when considering their record in close games (which I admit is largely luck based, there's no evidence that a team is actually clutch.  One-score games are generally won 50% of the time regardless) seattle is actually still below .500 overall.  Which suggests this year was simply an expected return to the mean.  Not an unusual bout of luck."
nfl,feiv296,t1_feitpjr,1579147991.0,"Yes.  Luck benefited them, resulting in more wins.  Thus they performed above expectation in the win category.

Look I’m really tired of explaining super basic things.  If you can’t grasp them that’s not on me.  Unless you’re trolling, in which case you’re just another asshole 49er fan.

DVOA says they performed as expected.  If luck made them win more then they performed above expectation.  But DVOA says they didn’t.  So if they were lucky, prove it.  With data comparable to DVOA.  Otherwise I’m done with this useless conversation."
nfl,feit4pn,t1_feirgxb,1579146525.0,"You’re still missing the point...I don’t have to prove he’s worth exactly 0.1 because my argument doesn’t rely on diggs.  I have the entire data set on my side.  DVOA says we should have won 10.9 games.  We won 11.  The combination of all data measured and evaluated across the entire season  says “Seattle performed as expected.”

Your argument is that they overperformed.  It’s your job to provide sufficient data to disprove the DVOA projection.  But you need evidence equal to what DVOA provides.  You can’t just yell “but those missed field goals!” And ignore everything else."
nfl,feircbo,t1_feiqodk,1579145261.0,"There’s no way to prove that.  Even in the four games he played in.  You could argue the first 49ers game, but without him we still came one inch from beating you in week 17...

Again, this is another case of you taking an extremely limited data set (*just* the diggs acquisition) and using it to try to prove a much larger data set (Seattle was lucky this season).

The reality is Seattle finished perfectly in line with their projected 10.9 wins.  That’s based on a combination of the best data we have available.  That evaluation might not be perfect, but it’s infinitely better than the few individual data points you’re trying to use to disprove it.

nfl,feiqkuq,t1_feios62,1579144728.0,"Ignoring the fact that this is a tangent largely irrelevant to the luck discussion, I alread agreed he was responsible for 0.1 wins.

Seahawks,feii7rr,t1_feihyw7,1579139121.0,No...my argument is you don’t dismiss a player for one bad year.  Especially their sophomore year.  It is extremely common for a player to dip in their second year.
nfl,feihz7i,t1_feihml3,1579138964.0,"Nothing you’ve said is a valid argument for ignoring luck as a factor in a football play.  But that’s kind of my point.

nfl,feihgek,t1_feihaj8,1579138623.0,Ah.  I see.  You just want to ignore luck-based elements in any play where it doesn’t benefit your POV so you can maintain your bias.  Got it.

nfl,feige1b,t1_feig4n8,1579137914.0,"You can repeat that all you want.  The best empirical data we have says you're wrong.  10.9 estimated wins...we got 11.

It is not uncommon for young players to take a step back before they take a step forward.  Flowers played well last year, especially for a converted safety.

Yes, Seattle had one of the best defenses in NFL history for those 3-4 years.  And who ran it?  Wagner.  He was the defenses QB.  

It is extremely likely you’re discounting Wagner simply because you haven’t watched him as much, just as a Seahawks fan would discount Willis for the same reason.  But Wagner is one of the best lbs to ever play the game.  Unquestionably.  Not mentioning him here when he played at the same time as Kuechly and Willis, and matches their skill, is definitely an oversight."

nfl,fe688ug,t1_fe682ev,1578883950.0,And if they’d reversed they call you’d be in here bullshitting about it instead of making stupid statements lol.
nfl,fe67wv9,t1_fe67tkh,1578883756.0,His knee is irrelevant.  His elbow hit.  An elbow marks you down just as easily as a knee.
nfl,fe67qst,t3_env82r,1578883659.0,"That last angle literally showed his head wasn’t even to the 1st down, let alone the ball.  What bullshit."
nfl,fe64mum,t1_fe64hv1,1578881684.0,Under 2 minutes left in a half is the only time a timeout is charged.
nfl,fe638ic,t1_fe6330p,1578880782.0,But Lamar Jackson is gonna win MVP lol.
nfl,fe5y6lo,t1_fe5xjmo,1578877570.0,"The runner tried to juke him when clowney thought he was going OOB.  Clowney was sliding, just trying to make the tackle.  Anyone thinking that was some intentional dirty play is an idiot."
nfl,fe5xlh6,t1_fe5xeg8,1578877198.0,The dude tried to juke when he should’ve gone out of bounds.  Don’t blame the defender for trying to make the tackle.  His own fault his helmet was ripped off.
nfl,fe5xig9,t1_fe5xerc,1578877145.0,Did they?  I watched that game and it seemed like Rodgers missed throws was the only reason the lions were in it at all.
Seahawks,fe4dfhb,t1_fe3uclb,1578858083.0,Honestly I think for better or worse every team in the NFC West has its QB for the next several years at least.
Seahawks,fe4cy3k,t1_fe3373a,1578857995.0,I noticed that with Lamar too.  I thought it was weird how he was always sitting down looking frustrated.  I’ve gotten too used to watching Wilson practically skipping along the sideline motivating people.
