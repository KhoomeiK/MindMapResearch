Second unit balled out but in the end showed why they aren’t starters. The Hawks had them so shook they couldn’t even get the ball out of our half 3 straight possessions."
torontoraptors,ff49ig1,t3_erflsk,1579558480.0,Hawks got my respect. We played like ass for huge parts of this game and they had our team shaking these last few minutes.

I’ll always remember his steals in 15’ ALCS Gm 6. If Revere or Donaldson get him in, our chances at winning the World Series GREATLY would’ve improved."
Torontobluejays,ff3imvl,t3_ergf77,1579541841.0,"Obviously we don’t know what other non baseball factors could’ve contributed to this, but seeing a guy who grew up in the GTA and getting a chance to play for his hometown MLB team never quite “make it” is pretty rough. 

It’s one of those careers that nothing seemed to go right after a certain point. It’s tough for the fans to see but way tougher for the players that it happens to. Reminds us that these guys are just as human as we are."
Torontobluejays,ff34cut,t1_fey356w,1579533359.0,"Business-wise, the 2015 and 16 seasons were a huge success for the Blue Jays and Rogers, with the amount of money they brought in. 

Not to mention those two seasons revived Canadian baseball in some sense and put the Blue Jays back on top of the Toronto/Canadian sports world, much like the Raptors did. We will probably see a lot of great Canadian talent in around a decade-ish in the Majors from the influx in baseball registration around the country. 

So yeah, no ring, which is the ultimate goal, but still great years for the Blue Jays."
Torontobluejays,fetqsbb,t3_eql51g,1579378518.0,Nice to hear. Good player/front office relations and trust in one another are super important.

baseball,fekrzru,t3_epj39w,1579206386.0,I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. I’ve never rooted harder for a team I’m not an actual fan of in my life than for the Nats during the 2019 World Series. That team was just so fun to watch and so likeable and full of awesome personalities.

If this is what you think will make you happy, or hell at least keep you alive, then absolutely do it. Above all just remember to be a kind and good person. 

If you don’t mind me asking, do you have any concrete plans set yet? Where are you thinking you’ll live, what job you’ll get, etc. Do you have parents or family that will support this? (Not that it fully matters but will help)"

SuicideWatch,fegelnk,t1_fege5lm,1579090075.0,"You’ve done all you can do and you’ve done it absolutely correctly. You can’t force someone to open up, the best thing you can do is let them know that you will support them however you can and when they feel ready, you will be all ears for them. I guarantee you that goes leaps and bounds for him, it definitely provides some comfort and safety knowing somebody has got his back, even if the rest of his life is hell. 

I’m so sorry again that you both have unsupportive and horrible parents. (I’m sorry if that offended you but I’m going with what I’ve read so far) That is probably one of THE toughest cards to be handed in early life, those type of parents. Yet your both still here."

Remember that your struggles and experiences are your own, and that you have no obligation to the world to be a certain amount of “successful” at a certain time. We’re all on our own paths to the person we want to become."
SuicideWatch,fegdlbl,t1_fegd0xg,1579088935.0,"Sorry to hear about your first counsellor, that was a shitty move by your parents. It’s good that you have a really nice counsellor that you like, even if you don’t trust them yet.

What about your boyfriend? Has he had an external help? Because if it’s anything like your deal i applaud you again for how much you’ve done for him."

SuicideWatch,fegcrfe,t3_ep12h7,1579087938.0,"You don’t sound like an idiot. You’re age doesn’t affect that your feelings ARE valid and what you’re going through is very real. 

From all accounts you are a far better person than I am, helping your boyfriend and friends when struggling massively with your own problems is a brave and amazing thing to do.

You talked about you and your boyfriend being each other’s therapists, in a way. I think it’s amazing that you look out for one another and are so open with your feelings together, which is hard to find these days, but I have to ask have you ever tried or used therapy from a professional? I know some people have preferences about therapists but sometimes they really do help people. 

The best person to talk to about all of this would be your school’s guidance counsellor, or at least that’s what I would do. They SHOULD be a caring, non-judgement adult figure that can tell you what your options are and give you some potential ways to get help."
