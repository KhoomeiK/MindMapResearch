I mean, yes, but actually no. The extreme was always there. They weren't merely individualists, they demand *absolute* freedom. In other words, they demand personal power. The power to absolutely control everything around them, in order to prevent anything else interfering with their desires. In essence, their freedom only comes at the cost of others.

You see it very clearly in the Bane books. He invents the Rule of Two because the Dark Side does not permit anyone to cease advancing their selfish desires and need to power, even in the most petty ways. And that was preventing any of them from getting the absolute power they all craved. 

They're all inherently evil. Some may do less damage than others. Vectivus and C'Baoth apparently preferred with extreme levels of power over a small environment, compared to the Emperor and others who wanted to rule the entire galaxy, but of course couldn't direct everything about the lives of all his subjects.

>Not to mention the fact they Empire was also made more grey. There was even an explanation there for its militarism and rigor that made it out to be for the actual good of the people - it was secretly preparing for Yuzzhan Vong invasion (it's actually an in-universe theory if I remember correctly).

Thrawn was certainly driven by that, and the Emperor had plans in case it happened. But it wasn't *why* the Emperor did anything, it was just a potential threat."

First, everyone's used to fighting one-weapon fighters, but aren't really trained against dual wielders. It's like fighting a left hander for the first time. The second reason is that lightsaber duels are high speed chess matches. You're not trying to hit the opponent with the first attack, because they've got precognition and can easily block. You need to manoeuvre them out of position so you can hit them in 20 or 30 attacks... but of course they're trying to do the same back.
