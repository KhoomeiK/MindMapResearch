Don't think he realizes that vaccines are constantly being reformed to be used with less dangerous additives. He is inadvertently giving credence to the crazies by saying that they put unnecessary stuff in vaccines. They put the additives in it to make them work and then work on finding better ones and reducing them. They just don't put something in a vaccine for no reason. Just like they stopped using mercury years ago. The vaccines our grandchildren get are going to be way safer than ours, whether we say stupid stuff on Reddit or not."

I said something about how people often don't care if their vote is counted because they are on the fence and have no solid vote. That's when I got him go going through my comments down voting and posting the nwordcountbot. All it did was say I never said the n-word. I don't think we will ever understand why. I think he was really hoping I was racist so he could put me down."
AmItheAsshole,ff7eu9a,t1_ff75kjh,1579647916.0,They updated it so you don't have to. This guy went on my account and did this to like ten of my unrelated posts in a row. It only shows the count the first time. All he proved is that I don't say the n word ever. Nothing we were even arguing about had to do with race. Actually now that I think about it I don't even think there was even an argument in the first place. Weird.

Have you taken Xanax before? Because for some people it makes them less anxious, but for others it makes you tired to the point where you can fall asleep at your desk and not even multiple slaps to the face will wake you up. If that happens I guarantee when you wake up, cops will be involved. So if you're going to do drugs, maybe stay home."

facepalm,ff0m9th,t1_feiv4ce,1579470223.0,I'm sorry but 2016 was more like voting between a turd on a plate vs the entire New York sewage system. They both sucked but don't act like they sucked equally.

Are you so full of shit that you would rather have Trump for 4 more years if Bernie does not win? Who are you protesting against, your self?

Edit: why did you delete your response before I could read it? You said you will only settle for the best but if Bernie doesn't win the person you will be settling for is Trump. Is Trump the best in your mind? Because if you don't vote because Bernie loses the primary, which is very likely as the Democratic establishment will do anything they can so he doesn't win, your inaction will lead to another 4 years of Trump."

facepalm,ff0b0pd,t1_fejp062,1579467043.0,I know a couple of people who voted Bernie in the primaries and then Trump in the election. Crazy right? They were both two of the biggest idiots I've ever met and obviously did not understand Bernie's platform if they decided to vote for the exact opposite when he lost. I'm really hoping this percentage of idiots do not do this again.

PoliticalHumor,ff08cog,t3_er1d01,1579466233.0,Yet they are the ones who constantly bring up 9/11. They also love to push being pro Vet but they vote against every measure to help them too. Pure pieces of shit. Why are their supporters so stupid?

My sister and I were going to run away with help of my dad and had a plan, somehow my mom decided to stop fighting the courts for my dad to get full custody and put all my shit on the neighbors lawn and it was 10 years before I spoke to her again. Going no contact was a mixed bag of emotions so I feel you there. You are definitely best to not have him in your life. He is mentally unstable, something that gets worse over time if left unchecked. 

My mom was normal when I was a kid and I was a mommys boy. I found out that certain mental illnesses can take form later on in life and with the help of my mom's new insane boyfriend she changed practically overnight. It's confusing because you miss your dad at his best, but that is not him anymore. Your dad has a mental illness. But that is no excuse to let yourself suffer. 

The positive thing I can tell you is that it does get better over time. It might help to write him a letter explaining why you are choosing to not let him into your life. Pull no punches. Even if you don't send it to him, this is for your healing, not his."
TooAfraidToAsk,fetle8n,t3_eql4cm,1579376558.0,"High school diplomas are valued more socially. People will look down on you for having a GED even though it makes no difference. The jobs that hire non college graduates are min wage, and they could care less about your diploma. If you go to college your employer will only care about your college degree, not highschool. I'm pretty sure job applications aren't allowed to differentiate between diploma or GED anyways. Applications that ask have the two combined so it says: ""do you have a highschool diploma/GED"".

Statistically people with GEDs make less. However that is because people with GEDs statistically choose to not go to college after. I have my GED. I also went to college. I am an Engineer. Anybody who would want to judge me for my GED can shove it."

AmItheAsshole,fetfwjw,t1_fetck0y,1579375077.0,"It's perfectly reasonable to leave someone because of their choice of friends. When you date someone you date everything about them too. If his friends affect the relationship negatively but there is no sign this will change, it's probably best to cut and run. You are young, the whole dating game is to see who fits with you and who doesn't until you find the right match."
raisedbynarcissists,feteuj8,t1_fetdye6,1579374712.0,"Usually when people change there has to be a factor that motivates them to change. They don't change on their own. As long as everything stays the same, she will have no reason to change. If you want her to change you are going to have to call her out on her behavior or something else that would disrupt  her environment.

Hell my mother changed, but I had to cut her out of my life for 10 years and it certainly took it's toll. I'm not saying that's what you should do, but just emphasizing if you want change, you have to initiate it."

Sad thing is, you will probably leave him, and he will end up spending more time with this group that will now feel empowered. They will probably say things like they were right about you all along. But honestly you're too young to be an asshole for leaving a relationship in general."
raisedbynarcissists,fetbys6,t3_eqkf68,1579373723.0,"This is difficult to read. It just gets worse and worse. I don't think you even realize how much of a monster your mother is. You really put up with her way longer than you should have. I think you should cut her out of your life completely.

And as a guy, I don't think you should worry about a guy leaving you for having a crazy mom. That thought in itself is crazy. A boyfriend will help you cope with it, not punish you for it."

Plus you are delusional if you think you can fake a pregnancy. This is wrong for the baby. Lying to a child about who is their mother is absolutely disgusting.

PoliticalHumor,felwhyi,t3_epussn,1579232683.0,"Be careful people, this is pro Trump propaganda at work here. Republicans will back Trump no matter what.

Part of the reason Grandparents and Grandchildren have such a great relationship is that Grandparents realize all the mistakes they made with their children by the time you are born and they often try to make up for those mistakes with their grandchildren. Your grandfather would be upset that he caused your mother to think this way. It's upsetting that this interaction happened but it's important to keep the interaction in mind so that you don't repeat the behavior to your kids one day. Focus on the silver lining on how it shaped your future behavior instead of dwelling on how it upset you and you can turn a negative thing into a positive one."

That's when I got him go going through my comments down voting and posting the nwordcountbot. All it did was say I never said the n-word. I don't think we will ever understand why.

Going no contact was a mixed bag of emotions so I feel you there. You are definitely best to not have him in your life. He is mentally unstable, something that gets worse over time if left unchecked. 

My mom was normal when I was a kid and I was a mommys boy. I found out that certain mental illnesses can take form later on in life and with the help of my mom's new insane boyfriend she changed practically overnight. It's confusing because you miss your dad at his best, but that is not him anymore. Your dad has a mental illness. But that is no excuse to let yourself suffer. 

The positive thing I can tell you is that it does get better over time. It might help to write him a letter explaining why you are choosing to not let him into your life. Pull no punches. Even if you don't send it to him, this is for your healing, not his."

I'm pretty sure job applications aren't allowed to differentiate between diploma or GED anyways. Applications that ask have the two combined so it says: ""do you have a highschool diploma/GED"".

Your grandfather would be upset that he caused your mother to think this way. It's upsetting that this interaction happened but it's important to keep the interaction in mind so that you don't repeat the behavior to your kids one day.
