I'm currently in college, and probably gonna stay, but I'd like to know of other options at least."

But if you want an example of a shitty organization that claims to represent disabled/neurodivergent people - Autism Speaks. For thr most part, autistic people *hate* them. They do us fare more harm than good, and they refuse to listen to us when we speak up about it. They tout themselves as the best one out there, but in reality, they're incredibly shitty."

ainbow,fefgxpy,t1_fefdkbu,1579056093.0,"....no.

I know of a high school like this who kicked a girl out for being what I heard as ""bi curious"" - dating another girl. I don't know if they were doing anything, but it's really like this at places like this. You don't talk about being gay openly in schools like that."
AskLGBT,feffn2e,t1_feez7ox,1579055318.0,"""Sexual repulsion should seak therapy."" 

I... am gonna be honest, I take issue with that. Unless a person feels that it's significantly impacting their life in a manner they don't like, people are *not* obligated to do stuff like that. I am sex repulsed as well as being ace, but quite frankly I don't see it as a problem and I'm not gonna seek ""treatment"" for it. I don't owe anyone sex. Not saying you're saying that, to be clear. 

Secondly. ""Asexuality is disliking and having disinterest in sex."" ... No? Not... really? Like, disliking sex is different from never finding anyone attractive and stuff. The concept of having sex for me is entirely disconnected from people and what they look like or whatever it is that sexual attraction is. I've literally never had any desire to do anything sexual by looking at them, or watching them, or anything. Like. That's... not a thing I've experienced. Ever. However, my desire or lack of or whatever to have sex with anyone is disconnected from that. Like. I can tell you that now, it is."
AskLGBT,feff35c,t3_eotgew,1579054975.0,"I mean, I was 15 when I first started going by ace, and it's been several years since. Ultimately, if you don't think you've ever been sexually attracted to anyone and you want to call yourself ace, go for it. And even if you're a ""late bloomer"", a label isn't neccesarily permanent. If its something you feel fits you then feel free. 

But yeah. That's my take."
AskReddit,fe6dqpz,t1_fe659rn,1578887916.0,"I got something simialar. ""Well, you do act weird, and your clingy, so....you kinda invite it.""
.... fuck that. Bullying is *never* justified. The victim isnt at fault. 

I'm sorry you had to go through that, and I hope things are a little better. Unfortunately sometimes the effects stay forever."
AskReddit,fe6dkqp,t1_fe5ulpp,1578887783.0,"Autistic adult here! I specify adult because I want to reassure you we do exist!

 A recommendation I have is to get connected with autistic people, and not just groups for parents. Groups for parents are good (but please, please avoid autism speaks, they're really shitty, theres a lot out there by autistic people on why) but autistic people might be able to answer questions parents can't.

But also - its not a death sentence, just to reassure you. It can be hard sometimes, most of my struggles personally have come as a result of other people not understanding or refusing to understand and/or accomodate at at all, but autistic adults exist and live good/happy lives. Its gonna be ok."
AskReddit,fe6d35f,t3_enut7n,1578887396.0,"""You're too hyper. You're too clingy. You overwhelm people."" - said to like a 13 year old who had no idea how to self regulate their adhd or autism. Gee, thanks mother. Great to know I'm always gonna be alone cause other people can't deal with me. 

For the record, I actually have some pretty good friends now who *can* 'deal' with me - and also, I'm not as hyper as she claimed or whatever. I was a lonely teenager. She also hated that I wasn't neruotypical. Never said it but the way she'd look at me or the way she'd tell me to stop stimming... yeah. Still fucks with me."
