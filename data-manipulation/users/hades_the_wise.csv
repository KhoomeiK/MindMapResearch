AskReddit,ff54ijt,t1_ff3s0qi,1579580008.0,"Their blonde roast is pretty great when you actually get it brewed at Starbucks, but a word to the wise:  absolutely stay away from the Starbucks Blonde Roast beans you can at the grocery store.  They're basically a dark roast in a package with bright colors.  Starbucks' coffees that you buy in the grocery store basically range from dark roast to overcooked dark roast.  I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that a dark roast won't stay fresh for as long, so it doesn't do well in a grocery store distribution chain (where a package of coffee can take months to get from roasting to being purchased - by which time a light roast would've gone stale).  It's why it's pretty much impossible to find light roasts in grocery stores, and when you do find one, it's usually a medium or dark roast in disguise.  Also, grocery stores' inability to keep fresh coffee stocked is why you'll never see a ""roasted on:"" date on a package of coffee at the grocery store like you'll see at a roastery or a local coffee shop.

Once you've had a fresh light roast, brewed within a month of being roasted, you'll never want to go back, though."
AskReddit,ff53yd3,t1_ff51iul,1579579568.0,"There's a Subway about half a mile from where I work (which makes it the closest restaurant, as I work out in the boonies) and I frequently go there for a quick lunch when I forget to bring anything.  In the year since I discovered their app and started ordering ahead, I've had this scenario happen:  I pull up to the gas station/subway, see one of my coworkers's vehicles pull up at about the same time.  I go in, and report to the cash register.  My coworker slips into line.  I get my sandwich, wave to said coworker, and leave.  I get back to work, get to the breakroom, and unwrap my sandwich.  Just as I'm finishing the first 6-inch, my coworker enters.  I wrap the other half of my sandwhich and put it in the fridge for the next day.  My coworker says something along the lines of ""Man, done already?  I need to check out that app"".  Then I go to my office and dick off for the next ~40 minutes of lunch break.


This would be pretty mundane if it just happened once per coworker, or hilarious if it happened two or three times.  No, it's happened every time I've ordered ahead.  All the same coworker.  I don't know if he forgets about the app 5 seconds after I walk out, or if he just forgets to download it later or he's downloaded it but hasn't actually remembered to use it.  Maybe he just forgets about lunch until right when it's time for lunch break, so he always forgets to actually use the app?  I don't know, but it's happened, with the exact exchange above, at least a dozen times in the past year."

I guess I get the challenging status quo thing - the draft exists for a reason (to give teams somewhat equitable access to recruits and level the playing field) and teams have a vested interest in making sure that new players enter the draft, so I guess turning down a Free Agent Burrow would be bad for a team in the short-term, but good in the long-term if that team ends up falling to a position where they depend on the draft - so most teams probably want new star recruits to continue going through the draft.  Even a perennial powerhouse like the Patriots is probably aware that they might end up being the worst in the league, with the #1 draft pick being their only hope, so even they would want to continue the status quo.

I guess I also forgot that even a #1 draft pick rookie might not end up playing in the first year.  Rookies are valuable as long-term investments, not as ""let's field this guy *this year*"" pick-ups, so maybe if free agents aren't as sure of a long-term guarantee as a draft pick, they're not as attractive as rookies (and I'm not sure how NFL contracts work so that might be the case too - are draft picks put on a longer contract than free agents?)"

Your wish is granted.  All footballs are replaced with javelins.  To compensate, players' padding now includes some armor on the chest.  Outstanding javelin throwers are immediately put into QB1 positions around the country.  Occasionally, QBs will intentionally throw at star defenders to eliminate them from the game.  However, wide receivers begin transitioning to defense positions, causing an increase in turnovers.

I made sure it was at the bottom of the jar every time I opened it to drop a bug in, and the only time it was ever a danger to anyone was when my arachnophobe sister found the jar and, using a hammer, smashed the jar (but not the spider), then ran out of my room screaming.

Exactly - if someone rejects you for something so superficial as ""too short"" or ""too tall"", then perhaps take it as a combination of red flag and dodged bullet - just run because that person isn't looking for a real relationship of any sort - they want arm candy, and usually disposable arm candy.

I remember when I was about 14, and only weighed about 90 pounds.

But once I was satisfied with my physique, I ended up turning to sodas to get my sugar fix.  That didn't catch up to me until my early 20s, and when it did, it *really* caught up - between 19 and 21, I gained about 30 pounds before I really noticed and decided I had to do something about it.

Cooking,fcl396k,t1_fck0vyc,1577738852.0,"That does sound like a horrible experience.  I should caveat that most church dinners I went to were for special occasions, like Homecoming, Revivals, Campmeetings, Easter, Christmas, etc.  I mostly went to Pentecostal churches as a kid, and all of them were rural/small town churches.  Sunday morning was a two-hour ordeal, at a minimum.  It would start with ""Sunday School"" at around 9AM at most churches, where people would gather in little classrooms, divided by age groups, and basically do a bible study with group discussions and activities (depending on the age of the group).  Then, after Sunday School, you'd have about 30 minutes before the actual service began, and people would just congregate and talk during that time.  Then, a minister (usually, a youth pastor or one of the deacons) would get up and open up service and lead worship - we'd sing hymns and then someone, usually one of the older ladies of the church, would get up and sing a solo.  Then it was time for the offering to be taken up, during which everyone sang one more hymn, and then the pastor would finally take the pulpit and give you 30 minutes to an hour of passionate sermon, and in Pentecostal churches, this was a largely ethos-based appeal trying to whip up emotions and get people into the altars.  And then it's the altar call, and after a minimum of 10 minutes of people praying in the altars (or 30 minutes to an hour, if things get frenzied), people go back to their pews and the pastor makes some closing remarks, and does the dismissal prayer.  And people will still hang around for 20-30 minutes after the service.  And then they'd usually split into little cliques, with large families going on to have Sunday dinner at Grandma's house and little cliques going out to dinner together (usually, there was a restaurant within a couple of miles of the church that was open only on Sundays, to give you an idea of the economic impact of these rural churches).  Sunday night and Wednesday night services were the same, except without Sunday School, and on Wednesday nights, the service usually opened with an open-mic ""testimonies"" session where pretty much anyone could stand up and say anything (but usually, used as an opportunity to ""testify"" about something positive that happened, and then misattribute it to God)

I think the main thing here is that most people in most of the churches I went to knew each other outside of church - the church my family went to for the longest was literally a family church, and everyone in the church was either related in some way or lived within a couple of miles of the church.  I've been to bigger Pentecostal churches in larger cities, and the sense of community is definitely not there - it's as you said, get in, listen to a sermon, do the altar-call thing, and get out quickly.  So I think the setting and the population of the church have more to do with it than the denomination. 

But yeah, all that is to say that rural southern churches are much more of a community/cultural institution with strong social bonds than other churches might be.  But still, for all the good community and food and stuff, take it from me and avoid Pentecostal churches like the plague because having grown up in those churches, I can tell you that they're nearly all batshit insane, bigoted, and manipulative.  They're not a cult, but they aren't that far off from it.  They're just a near-cult that happens to have really interesting (or scary, depending on your perspective and whether you'd seen a Pentecostal ""holy-ghost filled"" altar call before) services, and good potlucks.  Baptists might be better, but be careful with your selection as some Southern Baptist churches share a lot of doctrine (and bigotry) with the Pentecostal church."

Edit: By the way, the game in which they scored 93 points was a 93-0 shutout against Southwestern Louisiana (now known as the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns) in 1936, and it's also (obviously) their record for largest margin of victory.  They went on to clinch the SEC championship and play the #6 Santa Clara Broncos in the Sugar Bowl that year, which they lost.  This LSU team was notable for its defense, not its offense (despite the 93-point slaughtering of their in-state rival), as they only allowed a total of 33 points the entire season.

But streaming a live event, you can't just put a copy of the video on multiple servers distributed throughout the globe, because it's happening in one place, and you're getting the video live, as it happens, and distributing it from a single server.  That server and its connection to the outside world have to be absolute beasts.  In fact, I'd bet they at least have a few different ISPs with extremely fast fiber links directly to those ISPs' core nodes from the server that they're streaming ESPN and other TV providers' content from.

Cooking,fciyz1w,t1_fcho3bv,1577673201.0,"I don't know, but there's definitely no in-between.

The odd thing is that the latter tends to occur in churches that appear richer or have wealthier members - almost like nobody has time to cook and everyone phones it in or just doesn't contribute at all.

Oh and then there's black churches.  The two times I've been to a predominantly black church both featured an after-church dinner (and neither was a special occasion like homecoming or revival or anything - both apparently just have a church dinner every sunday) and both were absolutely outstanding - at one, I had the best damn turnip greens I've ever had in my life, and at the other, I had a Chicken Spaghetti that I actually enjoyed (which was a first - chicken spaghetti is one of those foods that I usually shy away from because it's usually so poorly executed).  And the experience itself was great - having dinner after church every sunday meant that the whole church was like a family, and it showed because they laughed, played some games, and were some of the most outgoing, friendly people I'd ever hung out with.
