I see what you're saying, but at the same time the United States government historically has the blood of many foreign nations on its hands, be that through its industry or through the efforts of its military and intelligence agencies in the supposed service of a higher good. The spectrum that elevates the US is a bit of a romance; the reality is freedoms for her (until more recently, only white and male) people and a great big fuck you to everyone else."
worldnews,ffxceah,t1_ffwsqhx,1580322274.0,"So, where I agree with you is that I think animal suffering is bad since both we and animals exist on different parts of a continuum of empathy and intelligence, and I look forward to the day where technology and perhaps culture allows us to circumvent that. I just disagree on how bad it is relative to human suffering, and I'll admit it's not fully thought out on my end; that I play ""favorites"" with more charismatic stuff that I haven't been conditioned to see as a commodity.

That being said, and this is not directed at you -- but as for me, I think I'd be a hypocrite if I cared more than I did about animal suffering yet continued to consume products that demonstrably *do* exploit *humans*, as I do -- I regularly eat berries that are no doubt farmed by likely underpaid, unbenefited migrant workers, and I type this to you on electronics that were probably made by overworked, exploited factory workers overseas, with conflict and slavery minerals, shipped by warehouse workers that are literally made to wear diapers and walk the floor for ten or more hours. All this, despite making a conscious effort to reduce the amount of meat I eat.

This is just one reason I could never find industrial animal agriculture to be the moral equivalent of slavery and the Holocaust. I believe, and again, this is not to judge you, that to draw an equivalence between the two is not only a disservice to the victims of those atrocities, but does not show the victims of today's human exploitation the urgency their problems should probably be drawing. I care insufficiently about the one, so how could I pretend to coherently care about the other?
