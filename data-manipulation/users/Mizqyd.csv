My dad played a few different Splinter Cells and R6s as I grew up, and they got me hooked on amateur gaming. He had Chaos Theory on his PC, and that was that first video game I ever felt confident playing co-op with him and my sister (taking turns). 

I will also forever hold to my position that Splinter Cell: Blacklist is one of the most well-done 3rd person shooters ever? due mostly to the level of creativity they let you exercise in choosing how to beat the levels.

However, inbetween those two (2005, 2013), there are some GARBAGE ones like Conviction. We found them at Gamestop and couldn't even get through the first couple of levels. 

So, like, the Tom Clancy brand is hit or miss, sure, but those hits were HITS by most standards."
