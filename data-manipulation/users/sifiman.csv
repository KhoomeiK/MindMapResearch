Also, Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro are known for their anti-SJW rhetoric and draw a crowd from the internet for that.

Over engineered and expensive but they're hands down the best at cars. No car is perfect but even a C-class stands out in terms of comfort compared to other brands.

Yeah theres short term and long term impacts but it's difficult to refuse to burn oil to heat your home in the winter because it harms the environment. And it starts there, then those companies get larger and would like to keep their dominance so they coerce those in power to keep things as they are. The ones in power know it's bad for the environment but its difficult to say no to improving your lifestyle. Justice and ""doing the right thing"" isnt a thing in nature. It isnt instinctual for us to think about our environment like it is to think about how comfortable we'll be by accepting the bribe. Not just comfortable but the social boost of being wealthy and powerful. That all stems from greed and dominance in nature because thats *exactly* the kind of species that survives natural selection. More territory, more food, more stuff means survival. That greed is etched into us and many species in the wild. Still our responsibility but it's difficult to avoid those instincts."

There isnt a ""normal"" as if it was all good before, as if species didn't kill off other species which caused both of their extinctions. We may never go extinct. I get what we've done is wrong, how harmful humans have been, but I've never believed we weren't a form of nature. Or some evil, outside force. We are natural, what we do traces back to how nature has shaped us. So I dont believe for a second that if humans disappeared, nature will be wholesome again.

Or the amount of people that starved to death because of Mao's great leap forward. Tens of millions of their own, dead. 

But if we wanna talk about post Soviet russia we can. Because its the same Russia murdering journalists under Putin's orders, who likely will never leave office at this point.

China imprisoning Chinese muslims, the Uighurs, in concentration camps is totally not like Nazi Germany, right? That can be overlooked. That's not as bad as America bombing militia men.
