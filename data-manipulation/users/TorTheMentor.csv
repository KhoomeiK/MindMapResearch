I'm editing here to make a few necessary corrections pointed out in a comment below including a salad I didn't quite describe correctly (check the response for changes).

The sourdough pancakes, injera, are made by letting a simple teff flour (teff is a grain similar in some ways to sorghum), water, yeast, and salt dough (sometimes with yogurt) ferment until it gets bubbly, then ladling it onto a hot griddle and cooking it just up to the point where it browns on the edge and gets bubbles that start to solidify. They hold sauces really well.

I see a few dishes I didn't quite recognize. A response below identified the yellow one on the right as at'kilt, potatoes, cabbage, and other veggies in niter kibbeh (spiced clarified butter).

It's true that too many are soy-based and wheat-based, and there should be more variety.

Some do have a lot of preservatives.

Some do encourage ""pizzatarianism.""

Then there are others that are very good and fairly clean. Morningstar has a chorizo crumble with a nice short ingredient list that's pretty transparent. Tofurky makes a really tasty beer brat that's simple enough you could almost make it in your own kitchen. Upton does some really nice jackfruit-based pulled pork. Some of the others like Field Roast are preservative-free enough that I had one grow mold in my fridge after about a week. They also tend to mix in more things like carrots, oats, and pea protein to make the sources a little less uniform.

Leverage is something I know you expect only a sophisticated inventor to use, but not everyone with ""trading experience"" is as sophisticated as they think. 

The best explanation for him might have been something like this: since margin lets you buy stocks, bonds, and other investments with us paying part of the price, that amount is how much cash you have to have on hand to keep doing that. Right now if you were to sell everything (not counting commissions and fees), it would be worth roughly $250,000. To keep buying on margin, you have to have 40% of that available in cash, or $100,000.

So with $102,000 in cash in your account, you don't have to add any money or sell anything. If you bought 30 more shares of XYZ at $100 a share, your market value would now be $253,000, but you'd only have $99,000 in cash, so we'd need you to deposit or sell something to provide the $1200 more to keep you at 40% of market value. 

That would probably work unless he thinks ""market value"" is too technical, or doesn't want to hear numbers. If either of those is the case, he probably shouldn't be using margin."

evilbuildings,fd17hmh,t1_fd00xvu,1578128329.0,This doesn't even qualify as Modern. Modern architecture (like Bauhaus and International Style) follows rules. This is someone who decided not even to make their own rules.
evilbuildings,fd16f71,t1_fd0npwb,1578127959.0,"As an art, architecture shares a number of important principles with both visual art and music. Here are some of the things that make a building good architecture:

Symmetry: exact or near visual mirroring along an axis.

Proportion: following natural and logical mathematical relationships between the size and prominence of different elements.

Shape: predictable geometric forms and lines.

Repetition and Harmony: allowing elements to follow a known and predictable pattern. This is also sometimes called rhythm in architecture.

Balance and Weight: appropriate relationships between heavy and light objects and materials.

Materials: clear and conscious decision-making around the makeup of structural and supportive surfaces. Consistent use of things like stone, wood siding, metal, glass, and brick.

Style: following a known genre. Just like music, architecture has both historical and contemporary styles that each follow the rules above differently. Some examples include Vernacular, Classical, Palladian, Georgian, Victorian, Italian, Arts and Crafts, Romanesque, Traditional, Prairie, Modern, Art Deco, Streamline Moderne, Googie, Midcentury Modern, Postmodern, and Neo-Eclectic.

Void and solid: a building can be defined as a combination of solid surfaces and things that cut into or interrupt the surfaces (windows and doors).

This building essentially violates a number of these all at once. Windows are all different sizes and styles, and don't follow predictable lines or rhythm. It's hard to tell what section of the surface is supposed to be ""dominant."" The design is top-heavy: we see large and prominent windows on top of smaller ones. Style is inconsistent: this is mostly a Traditional or Georgian-style house, but it has things that don't fit those styles (like the overhanging ""oriel"" or jutting window that only happens in one place, so it looks like a mistake rather than something intentional). In fact, none of it looks intentional.

You can break the rules in architecture, but you have to make a very strong case for doing it. This house doesn't. I'm not sure if it counts as Lawful Evil or Chaotic Evil."

ProgrammerHumor,fcjdj9f,t1_fcij07b,1577683876.0,"This board is probably from a time before DevOps, cross-functional teams, CI-CD, and crazy stuff like the Spotify model, and probably also predates Docker, Chef, Kubernetes, what have you, so yeah, not quite as clear a division anymore. My team is full of people trained as developers who do admin tasks.

Although I think plenty of us still think of project managers as some combo of Ben Wyatt and Chris Traeger. And designers still get cast as the Leslie Knopes of the world."

mildlyinteresting,fciz0hs,t1_fciwah0,1577673229.0,"As much flak as IKEA gets for ""cheaply made furniture"" and ""unclear instructions,"" I don't think I've owned anything of theirs I really ended up disappointed with. I got a table made of real wood that took all day to build, but is super-sturdy and even somewhat stain resistant (there appears to be a clear varnish on top). I have an Ekenaset couch (think 60s doctors' office) that hasn't bowed at all even with me being a pretty hefty guy who has sat on it daily and occasionally napped onto over the past five years. I have a platform bed which was easy to build as beds go, and the best part is that every single part is replaceable! All you have to do is grab the manual and tell them what you need."
OldSchoolCool,fciu6ij,t1_fcgwx1h,1577669896.0,"Yeah, only problem with those is that they are only flattering on  about 5% of guys if I recall, and TS was one of the lucky few to pull it off. Funny time fashion-wise, though, because somehow it managed to both challenge and reinforce gender-body type norms at the same time. Go figure (seriously no pun intended)."

OldSchoolCool,fcgwuxk,t1_fcfro2n,1577644853.0,"True, but by the same token, most of the people you met in the 80s weren't dressed like David Bowie or Billy Idol. From what I recall, what you'd typically see everyday people wearing would look more like the clothes worn in popular sitcoms of the time: maybe a little more like The Jeffersons for the mid 70s and Welcome Back Kotter for the late 70s."
OldSchoolCool,fcgw06r,t3_eh6g87,1577644500.0,"I never thought about it before, but 70s fashion seemed keen on showcasing men's legs and butts a lot more prominently (tight waists, bell bottoms, and platforms are hard to walk in without doing a strut). Side effect of the sexual revolution I guess? 

Also, it occurs to me that this persisted well into the 80s in what some of our favorite ""hair bands"" wore."
