Drugs,ff6zgu5,t3_ervp3q,1579638068.0,"I prefer smoking weed when I am partying. When I try smoking it at home or before going on a walk/watching a film I get anxious and jittery. I also completely lose my appetite for the next few hours, after which I get utterly ravenous. I also wake up with a weed hangover/ headache. I wish it agreed better with me. I‚Äôve tried different strains too. Sad face. Maybe my weed smoking days are coming to an end."
AskReddit,fem843f,t3_epp36x,1579243191.0,A couple of high quality chef knives and some top of the line pots and pans. A couple Le Creuset pieces would also be nice. My knives are shite and my pots and pans are all second hand. I love to cook! I watched a video recently of someone cutting slices off a grape with a fancy knife and I got very envious.

cringepics,fe66vyg,t3_enr32n,1578883131.0,"I was young and broke, and splurged to get my carpets cleaned. They came while I was at work and did a terrible job. I made them come back and do it properly, absolutely bossing the dude around for 45min telling him where to clean. 1/2 hr later he calls to ask me out. I guess he enjoyed the experience. I said no."
AskReddit,fdmom45,t3_em2vfz,1578558230.0,"My parents used to feed my brother and I early, at like 5pm, without sitting down with us. They fed us crap like hot dogs and fries, or hamburger helper, with hardly any variety. Then at 10pm they would eat their own special dinner, pork tenderloin, steak and other ‚Äúfancy‚Äùmeals. We only ate with them for holiday meals. We were also not allowed to drink the Pepsi. In private revenge I would go to the fridge in the middle of the night and chug Pepsi right out of the two litre bottle."

Drugs,fd5yj26,t3_ejuj4w,1578183115.0,"HOW TO HANDLE GARBAGE SAFELY

‚Ä¢          Physical handling of garbage should be kept to a minimum 
‚Ä¢          Use waterproof garbage bags
‚Ä¢          Be Alert to prevent sharps injuries! If possible look for sharps protruding from garbage bag, and listen for broken glass when moving the bag
‚Ä¢          Do not reach into garbage containers with your hands or feet
‚Ä¢          Do not use bare hands when handling garbage. Wear puncture resistant and liquid resistant gloves or use other tools designed for picking up garbage
‚Ä¢          Do not let garbage get too full. Leave enough free space at the top of the bag, so that when you grab it, you grab the top of the bag only
‚Ä¢          You may have to change bags more often to prevent them from getting too full. This will also make them lighter - and thus easier to hold away from your body
‚Ä¢          Hold the garbage bag by the top of the bag, away from your body
‚Ä¢          Do not place one hand under the bag to support it"
Drugs,fd5wvli,t3_ejuj4w,1578182512.0,"Omg! My nightmare! Recently I was changing the washroom garbages at a new job, emptying one bag into another when a syringe fell out onto the floor. Thankfully it had a cap on it, but my heart lurched and I burst into tears. I spoke to my manager about it, and their response was ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked here for 6years and have never seen a syringe.‚Äù This job was in Gastown in Vancouver, so it‚Äôs very common to see drug paraphernalia and people using drugs out in the open. The washrooms at this place are private,  ideal for drug using, so of COURSE people use there. Managements apathy about the situation wasn‚Äôt a good sign. I don‚Äôt work there anymore. I‚Äôm so sorry you have to go through this. You‚Äôll be ok!"

worldnews,fcbx7h3,t1_fcbjj84,1577591972.0,"Well that fireworks display was 20years ago during the Sydney Olympics, this is much different. The country is burning, people have lost their lives and homes, Plus an estimated 500million animals are dead. But sure, it‚Äôs perfectly logical to burn a ton of fireworks for the almighty tourist dollar."
worldnews,fcbedzf,t1_fcb6jds,1577585839.0,"I was there for 7months and worked at a cafe in downtown Sydney, so yeah some money was spent. But definitely not during the actual  fireworks as there was zillions of people in the harbour. We watched from the safety of a balcony."
worldnews,fcapz3x,t3_egvrh7,1577574268.0,"I was there in 2000 and saw the Olympic fireworks, million dollars a minute for 20min. They sure dig their fireworks. Just burning money."
