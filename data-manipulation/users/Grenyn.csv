That's where it's a horror story for me.

We see a lot of one-sided stories on this sub, where it's clear the OP is leaving out details to make themselves look better, but in this case the OP seemingly forgot to actually make the That Guy look bad. All he did was call him an edgelord because he wanted to play a necromancer (already not cool in my book, edgy characters are not inherently bad, and OP did not specify what the guy did to deserve being called an edgelord) and then blamed the party turning on him on the guy because of his choice of class, which the DM agreed to.

That's why it makes more sense to me to have the DM roll to see if the players notice anything they're not actively looking for. Passive Perception as it exists now just seems boring for players and annoying for DMs. It's not the idea that I dislike, because we do notice things by accident sometimes, but I dislike the execution."
DMAcademy,fegun1f,t1_fegsnj7,1579102910.0,"I agree with this method. It's too bad that people don't like it, but it's something they can get used to.

Passive Perception is just a garbage mechanic that Wizards should do away with already. It always only matters to the person whose Passive Perception is the highest, and for everyone else it's just a meaningless number."

Even then she probably won't change, because this is how she makes money. But a genuine apology is not in the cards."

So while we sensible people understand that you can ""tell it how it is"" without being a douchebag, less sensible people will think you're trying to confuse them into doing or thinking something they don't agree with."

Make her believe she's going to die unless she stops being such a shit person. It sounds awful, and she wouldn't mean it, but at least she'd stop being such a bitch.

Of course, what I want is illegal, and so she'll continue being who she is, and people will cheer for her."

But since you are not making any distinction, do you believe every single Nazi raped and claimed they were following orders, or do you want to reconsider if this hill is worth dying on?"
BeAmazed,fee5l4w,t1_fedw9qz,1579026864.0,"But just spine and competency don't make a good president. I don't understand this reasoning. Do you guys just vote on whoever looks the best? Clearly you don't, or this war between the left and the right wouldn't exist."
AskReddit,fee5795,t1_fee0jff,1579026633.0,"Isn't it an important distinction, though? Like the reason that trans women won't have self-lubricating vaginas, because the anatomy is just different?

I'm not trying to be an ass or anything, but I don't really see what's wrong with that comment in particular."

And the guy off-screen who just constantly exclaims woooow or aaaah or no/yes/what to whatever."
AskReddit,fedlpus,t1_fedkooi,1579014624.0,"I see. That sucks, but admittedly I've been in that mindset as well, and I still sometimes find myself thinking like that. Then again, I don't go on specific subreddits to talk about it, and keep myself out of most such conversations, and try to honor the regular pronouns."
