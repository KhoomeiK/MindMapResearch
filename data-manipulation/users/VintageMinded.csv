datingoverthirty,ffhybja,t3_etp1pw,1579959119.0,"It’s a common virus and needs to be destigmatized. There are medications that can help prevent outbreaks and to lessen them when they do happen. It’s really not that big of a deal. I get cold sores and just avoid intimate contact and sharing utensils and whatnot if I even suspect I’m getting one and start the antiviral Rx. I rarely have an outbreak now (maybe 1-2 a year), but it’s something I’m always aware of. Once you have a few outbreaks you learn what they feel like and can just take measures to lessen the chance of transmission. I don’t know why people overdramatize these things so much."
datingoverthirty,ffhwlww,t3_etpdie,1579957166.0,"The only real way to make dating less awkward, whether it be from online or “in the wild” is to just do it - annoying, I know. If it helps to think of it this way consider it practice and don’t feel bad about it because many people are practicing dating in this current culture because it’s changing rapidly. Most first and second dates aren’t going to go anywhere so just practice and enjoy getting to know another human being. Many of us are lonely and looking for even brief connections. Go on dates with people who may not be your concept of the “ideal” partner (as long as you don’t get a bad/dangerous vibe from them) because what we think of as our ideal usually isn’t realistic or what we actually need anyway. You may just find someone you like a lot this way. People are far too complex to parse whether they’d be a good match from a bio (and many are awful at writing good ones) or brief interactions.

Since your friends are giving that kind of advice they’re probably not giving you practical advice for how to meet people in the wild. A lot of women seem to expect the man to approach with zero signals from the woman, that’s just not realistic. Many men today will not approach you if you don’t give him very clear signals that you’re interested in him or want him to. Even the way you look away can make a difference (looking to the side is usually seen as disinterest/disengagement while looking down and then back up again is flirty). Find videos on Youtube on what those signals are and practice them. Don’t put the pressure on yourself that this practice will lead to a date, it’s just getting comfortable showing interest and being approached. 

Are you approachable in general or do you give off a “don’t talk to me vibe” to everyone? Do people just chit chat with you in public like at the grocery store? If not, watch videos on how to look approachable in general too. If talking to random men makes you nervous, start with senior women, they’re constantly talking to me in public and it’s good practice being open and inviting. And if a man sees you talking to other strangers while you’re out he’s also more likely going to approach you than if you don’t talk to anyone. It’s about strengthening a lot of little social skills and meshing them together. You don’t have to be the life of the party, but you do have to be open and approachable.

It can all be a bit daunting, but these are skills almost everyone has to learn, especially since technology (like texting) has been changing how we interact. People are losing their social skills.

Good luck! You can do it!"
datingoverthirty,ffgr54v,t3_etagfg,1579912946.0,"Have you heard of the new app called “Hiki?” It’s specifically for people on the spectrum to either find new friends or to date. Interacting with NTs is usually far more exhausting than fellow ASD folks so maybe that’s something you might want to consider. I can handle NTs from studying psychology for a long time, but for short periods of time before they burn me out. 

Research is showing that we have completely different cultures and ways of communicating which is where a lot of the exhaustion comes from in interacting with NTs; since we’re the minority we’re seen as being “wrong” or “needing fixing” and are expected to do all of the work of adjusting to their cultural norms while they often don’t do much, if anything, to adjust to any of our stuff. Give other autistic people a shot before deciding dating isn’t for you. And if it still isn’t, there’s nothing wrong with that either. Good luck!"
Exercise,ffglti7,t3_ete6p4,1579909217.0,"Have you tried belly dancing? It’s a lot of fun, an awesome workout, and creates a more traditionally feminine physique than other types of exercise, if that’s what you’re going for. It takes a lot of strength, but doesn’t really add bulk since there’s more varied movement than straight up weight lifting or body weight work."
