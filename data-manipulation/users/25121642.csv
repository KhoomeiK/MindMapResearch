To me it makes sense that it’s really cold when the temp goes negative. Winter temps are generally negative. Summer temps are positive. Spring and fall are closer to zero. 

The point is most of your criteria are simply based on your preference defined by what you’re used to."

ABoringDystopia,fdqqzwe,t1_fdqi3pq,1578673011.0,"This is a worse deal than just buying a home they can actually afford. There is a reason people shouldn't lease a vehicle if they want to buy it in the end. You pay substantially more money.

And what about transient renters. Students who may be around for a couple of years and plan to move elsewhere. I currently rent to students who are on a work term and transient workers who are only around occasionally. There current life is very transient and they don't want to commit to buying a house in a place they very likely will never live. You're pretending that everyone is in the same situation. Poor family just trying to find a place to live and I'm a money grubbing landlord fleecing them out of their paltry wages. The reality is that the model I offer fits well for a lot of people. 

Maybe you need to climb down off your high horse and take a look around you. Every situation isn't black and white. Yes, some landlords are assholes. But a lot are not.... just like everything else in the world. You have literally no idea who I am or who my renters are but you have assumed I am an evil landlord who contributes nothing to my community and fleeces the poor.

ABoringDystopia,fdq9g5n,t1_fdo9n1d,1578660173.0,"You assume a lot. 

You provide a ""solution"" so riddled with problems that it couldn't possibly get off the ground and you cover your eyes and plug your ears and repeat it to yourself over and over. Won't change the fact that it's useless.

No one will take on all risk of a purchase worth 100's of thousands of dollars with barely any profit where you're also forced to enter a legal agreement with 10s of people who may or may not live up to the responsibilities associated with it. It's a dead idea.
