StopGaming,fe9kpk0,t3_eo3gtp,1578938693.0,Try watching WHILE you do something productive! Some people can’t do it but perhaps make it a background noise for you rather than the thing you are focused at.

unpopularopinion,fcy2cp1,t3_ejcenk,1578073859.0,"I think the question is tho. What is considered beauty? Or intelligence? One of these questions cannot even be answered without philosophical consideration. And the other is only somewhat an answer societally. I think by saying this you are saying your view of what is smart or beautiful is the truth. Or that most people’s view is the truth. But then again why do we have authority to decide at all? If you claim “well some people are just attracted to what they are attracted to” then that would make this entire post null because some people ARE attracted to those most people would call “ugly” I agree with the fact that ya, it’s okay to not be considered beautiful or smart. But then who is making that judgement? And who has the right to? Even those you claim are hideous inside and out can be attractive to some people. Take serial killers and their love letters.  My problem, in summary, is you making a generalized claim for every human being alive who could be attracted to all the generalized people you claim are unattractive. You also make a big claim about what is intelligence. I also wonder. What is the purpose in this? You’re frustrated because Disney is encouraging people to love themselves? That upsets you? Yikes...."

AfterTheLoop,fcm6xbi,t1_f4k1v75,1577765815.0,No mid 20s are more like millennials from the people I associate with. We embody everything you’d think of a millennial as and often forget the people in their 30s are millennials. Lol
AfterTheLoop,fcm6ue4,t1_f4jgq7w,1577765753.0,"Those numbers are different based on which site you go to. In general, as someone born in 1998. I have more in common with millennials that post millennials. I’ve found people born the same year as me or who are even born in 1999 still grew up with some 90s culture. Still remember having the first types of technology, remember old shows, and music that played from the late 90s and early 20s. Because some of it was still airing/ playing in the 2000s. From hanging out with people at the end of that “generation”. We were in middle school, high school, and now college with people from “the previous generation” because they are one or two years older and often become blended. My bf is 25 and we still reminisce about the same things from back in the day. Just something I’d like to add. I don’t think these numbers although they try to make things distinct I don’t think they reflect exactly that way in reality."

offmychest,fcivcnp,t1_fcij5jt,1577670705.0,"You are correct but there also needs to be a clear understanding that sex workers are workers and it’s okay to enjoy porn. That comes from dismantling false ideas from bad education. That not all porn is sex trafficking. And what to look for in porn to know the difference or when to be suspicious. If countries like the US were more open about sex work it would be easier to also identify these differences through the country itself. Also, not to mention how good porn actually can be for people, or could be, if there was more education about how it is a productions and not reality. AND this could be a great economic opportunity for a country like the US."
offmychest,fciuv8n,t1_fciejf2,1577670367.0,"Firstly, I’m very very very very happy to have come across your comment. Growing up I’ve always felt strange for feeling sad and wanting the “monsters” of the world to get help. I’ve never been able to see people who commit crimes like that as inhuman. I’ve always thought I was weird for this, so thank you. 


Secondly, to add: I actually have done a lot of research and recently wrote a paper for my social work research class on pedophiles and treatment for them as a social work undergrad. People who are pedophiles, especially starting at young ages, are most often victims of sexual trauma. The ones that do the most variety of types of sexual offenses to others for a prolonged period of time where the children who experienced the most trauma (victimization) as I found in the articles I’m glad you mentioned this as a point to add. I’ve felt strongly about this in the last few years. Many people are also non-offending pedophiles  there are communities of them who work hard daily to not offend. One group is called Virtuous Pedophiles. They believe offending is wrong. But that being outcasts in society only makes things worse. That pedophiles are more likely to offend if they have no support therefore feeling they ache nothing to lose. 

We are all human. To protect people, children, we have to do more research and open our minds as a society. Pedophiles were victims and deserve proper preventative treatment. To do that we ave to find proper types of treatment. As of now, there is very little done for children who are experiencing sexual deviance like this and for adults it’s jail time which does not solve anything. I think similarly we (society)shouldn’t be quick to think GSA is gross or wrong. Humans are complex creatures. There are parts of our brain we still don’t understand. Also, if it is two consenting adults who are cautious and responsible about about possible risk  involving having children, then I think it isn’t for us to judge. 

We all have our demons. I’m sure we are all “gross” or “wrong” in some way to society. You’re absolutely right in what you’ve said. That there needs to be more scientific research. And I think a major shift in how these topics are presented. Because just education alone from early on can be the biggest difference. The ability to talk about sex openly to understand what isn’t appropriate for a child to be experiencing. And perhaps get help for it. And education about attraction so that people from all orientations and GSA is no longer a shock. This could change the quality of life for so many people."

offmychest,fc0tgkv,t3_efbuqt,1577299251.0,"Oh I totallllllllly picked up my bfs speech, mannerisms, and his sense of humor and I LOVE it. He’s such an intelligent comedian and intelligent person in general that I’m glad it’s something I’ve unconsciously picked up. We are kinda a gross couple too. Lol but I enjoy it. Life’s shitty. He and I struggle with some serious stuff. We have our personal strifes. Everyone does. We are human and deserve to be gross and coupley with people we care about. Definitely “lean into it” as my bf would say."
unpopularopinion,fc0sx31,t1_fc00dcb,1577298919.0,But you forget it’s not organic. If there is no one trying to make change there would be none because people are comfortable with what they know.
