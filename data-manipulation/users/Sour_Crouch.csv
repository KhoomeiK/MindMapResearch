insaneparents,fflp7ha,t1_ffjqdus,1580042297.0,The Air Force is called the ‘Chair Force’ for a reason! The videos on their boot camps are unreal to me.
insaneparents,ffk0k9s,t1_ffjikgd,1580012126.0,"Why don’t you join? The military is good for those in dire straights with ‘parents’. I joined the Marines at 18 and it saved my life. Got a decent paycheck every two weeks, housing and get to go to school paid via the government. It’ll be a hard 4-5 years but totally worth it in my mind. *side note: for you two to be able to be together you’d have to be married. Idk on your age or how long you’ve been together, it’s not a good idea to rush things but most ranks in most branches have to live in the barracks and civilians are not allowed to live there with you."

unpopularopinion,ff84e8d,t3_es4mix,1579665684.0,Steroids and testosterone don’t make your muscles bigger. They speed up body recovery so you get more work ins faster.
dogs,fde0ia8,t1_fddyxsm,1578328407.0,That’s absolutely not true. I bought a crate on sale for $180. Many vets also only have you pay for the vaccines instead of the vaccine+exam visit. I just got our third dog in august and I MAYBE spent $120 on all his vaccines. You can have enough money for day-to-day care but why should you have to have enough for emergencies before you get a pet? Do you have thousands of dollars squirreled away in case of a medical or vehicular emergency? I had a dog that was 100% healthy until she turned too fast and ripped her knee to shreds. I worked with our vet and she’s doing just fine know.
dogs,fddzlym,t3_ekvdn3,1578327804.0,"I have a lab mix that did the same thing. She basically had a total knee replacement. Go to the vet ASAP, it might be a small tear now and the longer left alone the more damage done to both the pup and your finances."
dogs,fddy6ce,t1_fddsig4,1578326833.0,Just because someone can’t afford expensive crates or gates doesn’t mean they can’t care for their pets. You don’t know the situation so maybe keep this rudeness to yourself.
unpopularopinion,fddxa9q,t3_ekrs2s,1578326225.0,"My husband payed just short of 2k for my wedding ring. I don’t have an engagement ring, we got tattoos instead. The only reason he payed that much is because it has both of our birthstones on it and I really love it. I bought his wedding ring and it’s made of tungsten, antler, and wood.

Also, many real jewelry stores give you an appraisal for your ring and you can get it insured. I had a ‘cheaper’ ring that was lost during a canoe trip and we got all the money back via insurance."
LifeProTips,fd3j38v,t1_fd379bd,1578158812.0,"They’re mold gnats, so typically they come from over watering indoor plants. We’re in the Midwest and all our usual outdoor plants are in for the winter so we’re suspecting that’s where they’re coming from. Just taking out all access to home life so they don’t migrate around the house."
LifeProTips,fd0zg28,t1_fd0yphk,1578125865.0,We used to have an ant problem and I thought I killed those suckers with prodigious glee but then these gnats came along and I now know that I took it easy on the ants.
LifeProTips,fd0yq95,t1_fd0pdq0,1578125583.0,I love you
LifeProTips,fd0k86q,t1_fd09wer,1578120003.0,I’ve been bleaching the sinks and drains every time they’re used at this point.
LifeProTips,fd0k375,t1_fd0dzoh,1578119951.0,"Yeah they’re aloe mostly, and since they’re outside normally I neglect watering them often. I’ve bleached out every sink and drain in the house so I’m thinking about using diluted peppermint oil and dumping it down the plants."
LifeProTips,fd031oa,t1_fczz0x3,1578112898.0,I have one so maybe I’ll try that with the candles and peppermint oil! Thanks!
LifeProTips,fd02sz7,t1_fd02p9a,1578112799.0,You don’t burn your party guests?! Whoops!
LifeProTips,fd02jqi,t1_fczysev,1578112694.0,You must be fun at parties
LifeProTips,fd02i21,t1_fd01qvy,1578112674.0,I think they came in with something because I cannot find the source. I have deep cleaned my entire house and they’re still all over. My husband is a germaphobe and obsessively clean so our house is already pretty clean. I thought it might have been some plants we brought in for the winter but I’ve removed them from the house and no luck.
dogs,fc6ctfn,t3_egbn40,1577477552.0,I have a dog that needed a 2k knee surgery. My husband and I had a long talk on if we’d remove the leg or replace the knee. It’s not that we couldn’t afford it but that it was a lot of money on something that may/may not work or last her lifetime (she was 2 1/2 at the time). We did end up doing the surgery due to the fact it could happen to her other knee. But that leg is going to be chopped instead of a new knee.
