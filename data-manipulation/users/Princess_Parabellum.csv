moving,ffiro9q,t3_etsfqr,1579981012.0,"Declutter now and throw as much money at moving prep as you're able to when the time comes. 

I have moved house across the country 3 times and am getting ready to do it again and in my experience, the first thing is to declutter all that stuff that you've been meaning to take to Goodwill. Be ruthless. The easiest way to move is to have fewer things to pack and move. Box up anything that is opposite-season or rarely used (summer gear, Xmas decorations) if it's not already. Start collecting boxes if you have the space for them. 

The other trick is to throw as much money as you can at the prep for moving. If it's within your budget, rather than collecting boxes you can buy a moving kit from Home Depot/Lowe's or online. It has regular and specialty boxes, rolls of tape, stickers for the boxes, bubble wrap, stretch wrap...whatever you need, and sometimes you can get a deal on a moving bundle. That's easier and takes less time than scrounging for boxes at the grocery or a liquor store. Hired help, even if only for half a day, falls in that category too. Go online, find a day labor provider that has good reviews and hire a couple of guys for a day. You stage everything and decide the load order, then tell them what to do.

I was there long enough for multiple fittings. Even so I ended up not paying for one of the suits because they did so many alterations on the jacket that it became unwearable.

The other thing, at least in Miami, is that most jobs are service jobs which don't pay well, and the people who work in them don't have a lot of education and are too busy trying to earn a living that they really don't care about culture because they're thinking about the bills that are due or putting food on the table.

Oh, no no no. 

A new house is a symbolic beginning, especially if it's your first house together. And everyone should deal with their own side of the family, which means he's the one to talk to his mom and say ""mom, I love you but cut it out."" He needs to stand up to her in a loving way, not push those discussions onto you so you look like the bad guy if mom takes offense. You're a couple, he's supposed to be on your side above all others. From your description it sounds like he may be a bit of a momma's boy (sorry).

If she wants to put up decorations, she can put them in her own house - I'm with you, anything with even a whiff of religion would be right out. If she said ""you can rearrange!"" then take her at her word. I recognize it's another time consuming chore but if you take the time to do it you may get some better optics on what the actual problem is when you're done. She may not care. If your boyfriend does care, for whatever reason, he's the one you have to have the discussion with."

While on the stand, you can ask for a question to be repeated if you didn't get it or rephrased if it doesn't make sense. If it still doesn't make sense, you can tell the judge you can't answer the question as it was asked.

Don't be afraid to tell them that something is beyond your area of expertise; there is no shame in saying ""I don't know.""
