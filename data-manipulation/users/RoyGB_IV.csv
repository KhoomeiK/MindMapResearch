Eminem,fehixgy,t1_feh6tut,1579117477.0,"I actually compare Revival and Encore era  a lot. In their times, they were looked at as subpar by a majority. They also both have Em's most political songs. Encore's Mosh and the bonus track We As Americans aim directly at Bush. Revival era is clearly aimed at Trump. 

And if you consider which album has more classics, I would say Encore has more. Not to say Revival doesn't have classics, I would even include the interlude. But the lower quality tracks on Revival cant complete with Encore's song multitude of songs that have become part of the nostalgia of Eminem.

There should be no question about what is right. Right is the absolute support, in every form, for the firefighters risking their lives in Australia. Right is making sure our oceans are not polluted or making sure coal ash isn't poisoning rural towns here in the US. Making sure the city of Flint, Michigan and more over everywhere else, that people on this planet are not drinking lead and other metals/poisons.

We need to stand up for right, and invoke a system were those persons out only for self gain are quickly stopped. We need a society ran by the common person, from teachers to doctors, scientists to engineers, grocery clerks to sous chefs, and everyone in between. The back bone labors who are behind the scenes, making life happen.

We need a global collective to plan ahead and prevent, with a 100% of our ability, the looming hardships that come from climate change. 

Nothing and no one is perfect. And on top of that, the universe is chaotic and messy. Why can't we have our cake and eat it too,... in knowing that we can, because we are prepared worse, not only for ourselves but for uncountable more generations to come."
