It’s more than understandable to get into a drug rut in a position like yours, there is a buttload if stress and trauma there,
I hope you take care of yourself and practice all the game reduction you can,
If and when you do find the strength to recover, come back to this sub and look for resources 

In the meantime, if you need someone to talk to hit me up, I’m in abou the same boat but I use booze like a basic lol. 
Not than any of this is lol worthy...
Anywho;
Sending you real love brother

I think if you put a shit ton of effort into being mindful when you drink, paying attention to all the sensations that occur, and not rushing to get as drunk as possible,

And also never ever attempting to drink a feeling away, or drinking ‘at’ someone,
It does get better.

But also a break never hurts"

addiction,fdbbn00,t3_ek7iz3,1578255805.0,"Hello I’m a recently turned 21 year old alcoholic just entering recovery 

If she co fixed to you that’s she’s terrified to turn 21 she trusts you with something, so that’s the good news.

That other dude down there is wrong.

There is more than nothing you can do,

You can’t control it or save her 

But you can be there for her, you can do a little bit of reading into addiction, trauma and counseling, and try to be counsel her a bit yourself 

You can point her to online resources such on reddit like r/stopdrinking if she’s a redditor,

You can be there for her, that really is the main thing,

If at all possible get her out of your parents house or at least beat some goddamn sense into them they sound absolutely awful. 

If things continue, if she becomes delirious, or honestly just the next time she’s blacked out, you can take her to the hospital or call the cops.

An MIP could force her into random UAs which makes it harder to drink frequently"

I’m here, I’d like to talk and get to know you better, I’m sorry you’re tired and in pain right now . 

You seem super smart, I’m sorry that your circumstances are making you feel all this guilt.

I certainly agree that meaning is relative.

It could totally make everything meaningless,  but maybe we can choose to make it the opposite, and things can be valuable? I don’t know either honestly, but I’d love to continue this theoretical chat.

Preparing for work in the future would make anyone anxious I think, and it sounds like you are dealing with a ton physically and emotionally. 
   
You are dealing with so much, and that take incredible strength.

Can I ask how you’re doing now?"
