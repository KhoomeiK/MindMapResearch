I don't think I have an innervoice/brain.

TBI,ffncz0o,t1_ffmohbn,1580064445.0,"I suggest keep practicing your skills even if you're not working. At least for me, it's been too easy to forget how to code. Once I start learning something new, I foget something old (but useful). It's a constant cycle of learning and relearning. 

As for syntax, it's easy to tell in interviewer I havn't used language X in awhile and I might have to look up syntax, and they're fine with that. What I've had difficult with (during interviews) is remembering concepts/patterns and how they apply to a question."
TBI,ffmdq6d,t3_eu7j3z,1580053056.0,"My TBI happened after graduation (not much long after) and it changed my after-college plans too. 

I became homeless (partially) to pay of my medical/school debt and took on the first job that offered that met my requirements:

- be close to public transportation: so i wouldn't need to drive/extra way to get to work if i lost my bike
- have no dress code: so i wouldn't need to worry about how I looked (to a degree)
- little interaction with people/preferably outside: same as above
- set work schedule: helped me plan for public transport/gym showers
- I forgot what else

Maybe you can make a similar list of what things you want to find in a job, head over to /r/jobs or /r/findapath , or even /r/askreddit, /r/nostupidquestions for ideas on jobs that meet your requirements or close to it. The idea's to pinpoint things you think you'd be ok with, instead of wasting time applying to any/all jobs that come across you."
AskReddit,ffm6nby,t1_ffjsb58,1580049380.0,"Telling S.T.A.R. stories in a funny format and getting people to laugh during an interview has been one of the greatest things I've learned to do and has landed me better job.

Sometimes in answering on question, I've also answered other questions theyhad, so we'd have more time to talk about random things (which helps to see if you'd fit their team). Making them laugh helps them remember you (so I'm told)."

Since I have a tendency to forget, you'll never see me without a notepad of some sort.

I will write down whatever information is needed to get the job done. If I need clarification, I get clarification.

Then I turn all that information into a neat package of data that my team can use. If i feel it's too much, I ask it to be sent to my email so I can put to my calendar and for accountability purposes (because it's easier to motivate when people know there's a deadline).

At my last position, my data gather tendencies made my team the top performer in the region, not once, not twice, but three quarters. We have been capable of doing the same work with fewer people, with a higher accuracy rate. From it, we received bonuses and I got a x pay raise. 

It may be consider a setback, which I don't deny, but with any difficult situation that comes my way, I found a way to work with it for the better outcome. 

Something along those lines. And guess what, I did it again at my new job (this time automating tasks, saving time, saving money). Manager told me I'm getting a raise at my review (though not certain)."

Also at the time was I had horrible social skills and was homeless with no friend (been working on them for a long time), was almost arrested because I couldn't talk to the officer.

> I've always had issues over eating food simply because its there.

I can relate.

I grew up poor.

Like, we got our meals at the park when churches handle out stale bread/doughnuts in bags,  kind of poor.

It wasn't uncommon to go to bed  hungry. Any time anybody offered food (or food's available), I ate it - even if I wasn't hungry. It's the fear of the possibility of being hungry.

It's difficult to NOT eat all the available food (fear of it spoiling). 

What has  helped me with eating is doing more trips to the store (which is convenient since my bus from work stops in front of the store) and only having enough for a few meals. I still panick sometimes and eat all my food, but I am working on fixing that."

I went something like, 

- first sleeping in a parking lot behind a storage container
- once I got a job, slept closer to work between some bushes and a wall
- started getting paychecks (and going to school, which meant a bus pass), started sleeping in company vehicles. Since I was away the first one at work (and opened), nobody caught on. Showered more frequent.Else, gave myself a quick rise down at work using a hose.
- Got a bicycle/storage unit. Moved stuff into unit which gave me a peace of mind.
- Saved enough for a junker. Still took the bus/bicycle everywhere. Used junker mostly for better sleep.
- Got better sleep.
- Took me a few years to pay off student loans.
- Student loans paid. Went to working part-time.
- Used extra time to work on social/interview/resume/new skills and to better sell my skills.
- Got better paying job.
- No longer homeless.
- Worked on getting better paying job.
- No longer homeless and can now start saving up for a future."

I feel I'm about 5-10 years behind my peers.

What they have accomplished years ago I am just getting around to. But at the same time, I also did not grow up with the same resources they did and was still able to do some things (e.g. go to college), so that feel like a triumph. 

My setbacks were mostly due to growing up in poverty. I didn't develop the social skills needed to develop relationships with people. Who would want to befriend the smelly kid that worse oversized handmedowns. Childhood was lonely. Actually, life was lonely until not long ago. I finally paid off my student loans. I was able to work fewer hours because I lived frugaly. I used that extra time to work on my social skills which lead me to interviewing better and getting a way better paying job.

What's your relationship like to your friends/family like?

I've heard of relationships getting sour because the debtor couldn't keep up with their payments to their creditors.

I say, keep them informed on your progress/setbacks.

I've been homeless for a long ass time and after that I helped people (when I could) improve their situations. One thing I noticed was between those that let others know of their plans/progress and those that didn't.

People like to see that you're at least trying.

Those that did seemed to have an easier time negotiating new terms with their creditors/friends/family vs those that didn't.  Things didn't come up as excuses, instead as situations that the person had a plan to deal with but may need to renegotiation how/when they'll pay a person back (e.g. like having issues with the car they're sleeping in)."
