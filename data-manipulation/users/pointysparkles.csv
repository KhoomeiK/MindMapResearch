Some follow-up questions:

- How does the nail-head-shaped piece get detached at the end? Or does it?
- How is this different from how a *corded* riveter gun works?"
educationalgifs,ffcuart,t3_eswvcn,1579807403.0,... how does it work?
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffau1hy,t1_ffacjcm,1579744482.0,"But consider, when it's *not* written, you have a whole other set of tools to convey your meaning: tone, body language, facial expressions, even what you're wearing. And you can usually adjust your arguments based on the reactions of the people you're talking to. Precision in language isn't as much of an issue if you can clarify as needed in real time."
oddlyspecific,ffar0l7,t3_esj5pr,1579742464.0,"I mean, if you give me one, I will eat it. But I don't think that description is *wrong*."
HPfanfiction,ffa28g2,t3_eshsf7,1579726422.0,"Uh, the way I imagine it, it works *exactly* like dodging bullets, meaning getting out of the way of where the wand/gun is pointed *before* it's ever fired, because like you said, once it goes off it's too late.

I feel like this is what people usually mean when describing people dodging spells/bullets? Not that ""bullet time"" junk. The Matrix has a lot to answer for."
FanFiction,ff9aqz3,t1_ff84wvt,1579708706.0,"I know, right? And the worst part is that sometimes I'm not even sure they used the wrong word until three paragraphs later, and it makes a pretty big difference in characterization."
FanFiction,ff72oru,t1_ff71g5a,1579639918.0,"I'm with you 100% on this. I still can't believe that ""pomegranate"" rhymes with ""granite."""
FanFiction,ff6xd4v,t3_erwzl8,1579636834.0,"Lately, what's been driving me crazy is ""in askance"" - that is *not* a valid grammatical construction, and it especially has nothing to do with the word ""ask.""

I can think of lots, though:

- Breath vs. Breathe  
- Sooth vs. Soothe  
- Use to vs. Used to  
- Suppose to vs. Supposed to  
- Than vs. Then  
- Conscious vs. Conscience vs. Consciousness  
- Imply vs. Infer  
- Principal vs. Principle  
- Wary vs. Weary  

None of those have ever stopped me from reading a fic, though, at least not by themselves. Not even ""in askance."""
FanFiction,ff6uk3y,t1_ff6fryy,1579635177.0,">I...don't quite understand the purpose of bitching about typos.

I can think of one right now, in this particular context. I am a writer, and I care about my writing, and about things like grammar and spelling, so if I'm consistently making an embarrassing spelling mistake because I genuinely think a word is spelled one way when it really isn't, then I would very much like to know that.

It happens to all of us sometimes, especially if we read a lot of fic where people make the same mistakes. You learn spelling primarily by reading, and fandom can get pretty insular sometimes."
FanFiction,ff6sn4j,t1_ff6ivcl,1579634046.0,"To be honest, the way native English speakers deal with this half the time is just reworking the sentence - ""I put the book on the bedside table, and reclined on the bed."" ;b

Seriously, though, I must have looked this up like eight times already, and I'll probably have to do it again the next time it becomes relevant, so it's not just you."
FanFiction,ff5te0e,t3_erovut,1579609533.0,"AO3 was established largely in response to other platforms arbitrarily removing slash and explicit fics, and unlike FFN, it has no content restrictions by design.

I also think the userbase for AO3 skews a little older than FFN, and possibly more female, but I don't have any hard statistics to back this up."
FanFiction,ff4ufb2,t3_ernojf,1579572697.0,"You'll want the [Porn without Plot/Plot? What Plot?](https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Plot%20What%20Plot*s*Porn%20Without%20Plot/works) tag - or alternatively, the [Porn *with* Plot](https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Porn%20With%20Plot/works) tag, depending on exactly how thin that plot is.

PWPs are actually very popular, even on FFN, where they're technically forbidden. Just expect a lot of *anonymous* kudos. ;b"
FanFiction,ff21tjn,t3_er21o2,1579491512.0,"It's a cycle. I write, and I think it's great, and then I get progressively more dissatisfied/insecure, which causes me to abandon the project for at least a couple of months. Then I forget enough about it that the insecurity dissipates, and so I look at it with fresh, more objective eyes, and I edit what needs editing until I think it's great again, and then I write some more - until my anxiety eats up my motivation again, and I stop for another couple of months.

That's how it works for me, at least, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anybody else."
FanFiction,feyvxox,t1_feyovz9,1579451096.0,"It's weird, because the dashes on AO3 look way longer on mobile than on my desktop browser. (Or maybe the other way around?) I have no idea why, because it's the same font, and en-dashes are supposed to be the width of an ""n,"" and em-dashes the width of an ""m,"" which is not at all what shows up in either case.

I tried the double-dash thing, too, but it would drive me crazy that it looked fine on one platform but ridiculous in the other. Finally I googled an em-dash, copied it, did a find-and-replace, and updated all my chapters. It's still not the same length, but there's less of a difference, and it's not ridiculously short, either."
FanFiction,fetfs84,t1_feszzu0,1579375038.0,"I'll take your word for it - I haven't played around with it that much. It seems weird that you can add private bookmarks to collections at all, since they effectively just don't show up."
FanFiction,fesutou,t1_fessimt,1579369210.0,"You can also have bookmarks in a collection, I think, and that wouldn't affect anything about the original work.

But I agree, bookmarker's tags work better for most purposes."
educationalgifs,fesjade,t1_fepxu8p,1579365751.0,"Yeah, but just think how many landslides must have happened over those millions of years, and then condense them all into 30 seconds."

FanFiction,fes5kzg,t1_fes1r8g,1579361647.0,">but unless you check the box to make them publicly viewable, all bookmarks are automatically private.

I don't think that's true. You might be able to change it in your account settings, but I'm pretty sure they're public by default. Unless they changed it since I got my account.

There's also a ""rec"" checkbox you can tick to let people know it's a recommendation and not just a regular bookmark. Those bookmarks get a little heart icon, and you can filter for them and/or bookmarks with notes when searching."
GifRecipes,fepc44e,t1_feox6fs,1579316895.0,"You don't have to serve the whole thing. When I make stuff like this, I cut it into medallions, and everyone gets two or three of those along with some potatoes and a vegetable side."
atheism,fep32ye,t3_eh8a0p,1579311037.0,"Even if something like a god does exist, I think the form of it would be divorced enough from our concept of divinity to make the distinction moot.

I have two cats. One of them is really good at communicating, and the other one prays. He's always disappointed when I don't turn the rain off outside for him - and he knows I can, he's seen me do it in the bathroom, which is way more evidence than most other religious people ever get."
FanFiction,feo87wy,t3_epumfz,1579296407.0,"I don't think I've ever noticed this problem in fic - which is interesting to me, because I'm pretty picky, and I don't doubt that it exists. 

But I've definitely come across it in comics. Webcomics, fancomics, fanslations, professionally published Marvel/DC comics... If you have more than one emphasized phrase per speech bubble, that's *too much*, and a lot of the time it seems like the creators thought they needed at least one, as a rule of thumb, but six would be better. Most of the time I don't even know how to read that."
