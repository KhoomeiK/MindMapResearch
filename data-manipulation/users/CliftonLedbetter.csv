That leaves Andrew Johnson— also acquitted.

So, what other presidents ??? There’s only been 4 impeachments in American history and I think we covered them.

The very word impeachable means that the person is no longer fit to hold an office (not just president, judges can be impeached, etc)

The whole process is about removal from office.

Just because Bill Clinton was acquitted does it mean he wasn’t impeached? No he was.

Even the republicans don’t dispute the evidence. Trump withheld aide to Ukraine in exchange for help winning the next election. It’s clear cut.

The republicans just don’t want their president removed. He is guilty as hell though of both abuse of power and obstruction of justice.

And you’re talking about Impeachment historically, this one has been fast, other impeachments have taken much longer. 

The house investigation is not the senate trial, which is in its 5th day.
