AskReddit,few6t64,t3_eqjrvi,1579406121.0,"I never get bored of replaying Monster Seed and Breath of Fire III. A couple of PS1 classics with many many many hours of gameplay and various puzzles built in to turn based combat systems and ""open-ish"" world exploration through non-linear gameplay but mostly linear story arc. 

Every time through I can play them out differently, which was pretty rare for adventure games from that era as I remember. 

Highly recommend either for anyone looking for some challenging classic fantasy adventure nostalgia with a a couple of weeks to kill. (My lowest total play time in game of a BoF III run is maybe 50ish hours, and that's having beaten the game many times already)"

summonerschool,fefejnf,t3_eoo2qm,1579054640.0,"I was going to say that understanding the AA/kit  downtimes of both yours and the enemy champ is probably the simplest way when compared with wave control and positioning. 

Just knowing AA rates can drastically improve both your CS and ability to deny the opponents. 

But I see you're in plat so that's probably not an issue for you. 
Still a good way more newcomers to become more dominant in lane phase, and maybe some will see this."

summonerschool,fbezqv5,t3_ecwnqz,1576797890.0,"Came back a few months ago, never had bots in my BP games until this past weekend. 

After two games with 4 bots between them, I started noting it.  I played 9 games in a row and across all the games there were a total of 15 bots.  Not a single game that night with a full 10 human players. 

The experience came out of no where, and last nights games I'd say only about 20% of the people I played with were bots, so its improving (maybe?) 

Interesting to read that its more common after 11pm NA because that's exactly the time frame I tend to play in."
