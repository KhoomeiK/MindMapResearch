TrueOffMyChest,ffbd8tw,t3_esj1x2,1579760438.0,"as a fat person (205, 5"" 10'), i have not always been the best weight since i could remember, and have been told by my dad on how i was not as good as everybody else, he was probably just trying to help me in the way he knows how to, and recently since the summer ended, i have been slowly losing weight from 224 in september, to 205 today, i was never really a big eater, no junk food or binge eating. I have also been active alot, going from boxing for two years, gym for 1, and wrestling for a couple months now, and i have not really lost any significant weight until now, yet i look exactly the same as before. I am baffled on how people around me eat junk food every time i see them, yet they are on the more skinnier side. I put alot of time into exercise and had to go on a low fat, low carb diet due to a health condition that was caused from me eating too much fat ( which i did not know how, and the doctors looked baffled when i told them i dont eat junk food) and even that extreme diet of grilled fish and lettuce 3 times a day for two months did nothing to help my weight. I would suggest too not promote obesity as normal, but not ridicule those who happen to be obese as well"

TrueOffMyChest,ff7gb5g,t3_es1xl9,1579648884.0,"*Let me preface this by saying I AM NOT RACIST nor do I condone racist activitities by said racists.  I loved Obama and I have many friends of the dark  variety.*

My story began   as I  was enjoying a delectable meal  at my  local Applebee’s  down the street ; when I happen to notice this little bitch ass toddler using the fucking water fountain.   

*for context sake, she was in fact of African American Descent*

last time I checked I wasn’t at a goddam zoo, so why the fuck is  this  primate not using the colored water fountain?? let me tell you, this street scum was getting on my nerves but I let it slide; as I wasn’t some sort of racist that discriminated on African Americans.

But I was watching her intensely now.  And Just when I’m about to lose interest, I kid you not the little brat pulled out  a jet black IPhone 7 plus that she owned.

Jet black...

Black... 

She owned a Black...

This bitch was a racist! I grabbed my whipping stick from underneath my white cloak and whipped this genetically inferior drug addicted monkey back into the Cotten fields where she belonged.  

I told her that me and my Klan members would mail her severed body in a crate to Africa, and this is where I called her the  [n word] 

She was being  a retarded  racist shit; which is a very common trait in the African American youths. Because of this  I believe  I was warranted in calling her the [n word]."
