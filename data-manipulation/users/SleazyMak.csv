As time passes more people that have gotten sick but didn’t die might. Causing a rise in mortality for the same number of infected.

You state that it’s more likely we find out the mortality rate has been overstated and is actually lower than reported, but I’m not sure I’m following your logic. I understand it’s harder to hide deaths I just don’t understand why that means it’s likely the number has been inflated in any way. That should just mean it’s closer to accurate. 

Also, there’s definitely panic that causes otherwise healthy people to go to hospitals but you literally have no way of knowing that the hospitals aren’t filled with actual infected people.
