depression,ff2qesm,t3_erbzm6,1579519292.0,Post something like this on this subreddit. There's gonna be someone who'll come across this. You wanna talk ?
depression,ff2q42a,t3_er3j14,1579518850.0,A hug for you
depression,femozo1,t1_femop5m,1579265229.0,"Yeah, exactly my point.  Feeling good is a feeling completely alien. It just feels like the can before the storm."
depression,femhrkn,t3_epyf3a,1579256209.0,Maybe it's because you don't know what'd you do if you were happy.
depression,fejt3t9,t1_fejsyyp,1579185192.0,"Shit, OP. I'm so sorry. I often go through those, although they're sporadic in nature. But I feel you. The lows are absolutely brutal. Hang in there. You wanna talk, I'll be there to listen."

depression,fegb3hs,t3_ep04ey,1579085774.0,It's alright to feel like that. Just let it out. What's bothering you ??

depression,fegasnl,t1_fegamdx,1579085355.0,"Also, talk to someone on this subreddit. Maybe me, maybe anyone else you find. Everyone's out here to help you"
depression,fegargp,t1_fegamdx,1579085309.0,"Exactly. No one has to. This is a silent battle. I'm not pointing fingers, nether do I want to. It takes balls to talk about mental health publicly, but at times, when I see people using it as nothing but filler material for their social media, it just pisses me off

So, if you're one of the lucky ones, maybe you'll find someone who can be with you through your lows, and rejoice in your highs. If not, there are people on this subreddit who'd love to see someone posting about the small challenge they overcame"

depression,fed1vry,t1_fed1fa5,1578994539.0,"Oh, damn. Sorry, OP. That must be really hard. Let this go. I know it must be hard. But it's in the past. Move on. 

Try to distance yourself from the toxicity. That's all I can say. Be it music, movies, reading,... anything to keep the negative thoughts from your head.

It won't be an easy battle, but it'll be one worth fighting"
depression,fed1lm3,t3_eoisjs,1578994120.0,"Hating yourself, well, is not a singular experience. A lot of people go through it, in varying degrees of intensity, stages, and conditions. You're not alone. 

You hate yourself, probably because you have a firm idea of who you are/ what you want to be/what you should be. You're trying to reach expectations that you feel you or society has thrust upon you. Maybe it's to be smart. Maybe it's to be successful/be in love with a beautiful girl/boy or be focused and dedicated to a singular goal. 

And so, you'll find yourself battling against the burden these expectations placed on you. Some days, they'll be far away. The others, you'll feel like the world is closing in on you, you can't breathe, and all you want to do is escape it all. 

But that's where your spirit to fight will be tested. So, don't give up. Know and believe there's a light at the end of the long and dark tunnel. You will come out stronger."

depression,fe8d27u,t3_enkbtf,1578924921.0,"You're depressed, man. Your brain chemistry's been shot to shit, to be frank. Talk to a psychiatrist. Tell them what's going on. They may give you meds, but it's the first step to recovery"
depression,fe0yodt,t3_enlaod,1578820408.0,"Hey, OP. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.  Hope that cheers you up, just a little."
depression,fe0yfln,t3_enlbnf,1578820284.0,You got sober. You're trying to get your life together. Keep doing that. It will be hard. Don't give in to the temptation. Be strong. You've got this.
depression,fe0gife,t3_enk8n5,1578813072.0,"That's good, OP. Go get it !"
depression,fe0gavr,t3_enk9ki,1578812961.0,"Talk to someone, OP. Even if it's your parents, for a start. Get the therapy you need. Try your best to put on the most generous and genuine smile you can. Good things will come to you. You will struggle, but they will come if you work towards them."
depression,fe0fisw,t3_enkbtf,1578812549.0,"Because you're scared they won't understand. That they'll just trivialise what you've been going through. That "" Just take a break"", "" Go do something fun "", "" Try something new "" etc,etc, will be the replies you get. That you'll be in the same place as you were before talking to them. 

You wanna talk, man ?"
depression,fe091gh,t3_engd6e,1578806439.0,"I get what you're going through. I remember just being glued to the screen. But the time after it, I just felt like a hollow shell. It scared me, because I just saw myself in it. It was a reflection, like looking into a mirror. And if you feel the same way, then talk to someone about it. Cause it's not healthy. 

The Joker's just a dark reflection of our inner and outer alienation from society. Don't give into it. Don't sympathise with Joker. You aren't meant to."
depression,fdkx7eg,t3_elxjm9,1578513015.0,"First of all, happy birthday OP.  Secondly, talk to people on this subreddit about what you feel. It'll help"

depression,fdcn71n,t1_fdclm5g,1578279085.0,"No, OP. You can't think like that. You deserve hello too. What you're going through, I also go through it. All the time. Trust me, it's better to get help."
depression,fdcl85h,t3_eknaqd,1578277676.0,"Your friends are right, OP. Go seek out a therapist. It'll help you a lot."
depression,fcq0x03,t3_eigt9y,1577876359.0,"The end goal is you being happy. That's what it always is. You enjoying life. It will be out of focus at times, but still. That's the end goal"
depression,fcpxq8n,t3_eigt9y,1577874412.0,"Yeah, cause giving up is easier to do than to persevere. Do that. Hang in there. Don't let go of that happiness you deserve."

depression,fce9sq8,t1_fce1w48,1577618389.0,"OP, I want you to think about two things : 

1. If everyone was the same, what would make us different and unique
2. If a man gained everything desirable in the world, but lost his soul, what would all the riches and desirable things in the world matter to him ?"
depression,fcdxrxe,t1_fcdwdyb,1577614881.0,"You ever think that your pain's a gift ? That all this suffering is only thrust upon those who have something great in their future ? Cause no matter how you look at it, suicide is never the way out. If you feel like that, then your close one have failed you. Your society has failed you. But you can't fail yourself. Talking the easy way out is the way of the coward.

 We have all this hurt thrust on is, because deep down, we have the strength to handle it. We just need to find it. The right experiences will lead you to it. You just need to be in the lookout for them."
