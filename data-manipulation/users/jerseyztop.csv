I have a list somewhere (if it's not missing haha) but offhand these are the objects that disappeared and then either reappeared in the original/obvious place or a random wtf place: remote control, cell phone, box of cigs, lighter, garage card key, watch, holiday decor, my favorite hat, knee-high stockings, and... the one that freaked us out the most - a jar of mayonnaise. We believe it was a ghost that liked to play tricks but some of these items were impossible to hide. Would love to get a behind-the-scenes. The activity has stopped so the mystery fella must have moved on."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fezi12a,t1_fevfruj,1579457578.0,"I believe you and can relate. At our house, we had that same activity. I did some research and Disappearing Object Phenomenon came up but fairies did as well.  I have a huge list somewhere of all the objects that went missing at our house and then appeared where they were supposed to be or in a completely strange place. The activity stopped and then random dimes started appearing in odd places (one was found in a box of coffee filters for example) and if you google ""dimes appearing"" you find that's a thing too. We haven't had any activity in our house in a very long time, so I wonder if whoever/whatever it was got bored with us so they moved on to another house or if it was a spirit and they crossed over. Life is a mystery!"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,feunj3t,t1_feu3ul3,1579388261.0,Then that truly is bizarre. A humorous nerdy ghost perhaps.

ParanormalEncounters,fbjgl66,t3_edlg26,1576933056.0,"I'm not a skeptic but the behaviors you describe are similar to those of my autistic niece. You mention that your sister may be on the spectrum so, if that's the case, it's very important that your parents get her diagnosed and if confirmed, get her in a program for developmental and behavioral treatment immediately."
