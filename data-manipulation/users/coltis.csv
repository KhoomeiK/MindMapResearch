oneplus,fee74lp,t1_fe8prl4,1579027775.0,I have the same problem but on 7Pro. Restoring or launching in safe mode makes no difference. The phone somehow overloads when making certain animations or UI movements.
oneplus,fee6tuf,t1_fee4xuh,1579027599.0,I upvoted and replied!
oneplus,fee4gd0,t1_fee3q5f,1579026193.0,"Really nice summary of the problem!

Do you also get lag when returning to the home screen? The animation is super choppy for me, though only occasionally. Using buttons instead of gestures helps slightly, but not fully. This is by far the laggiest phone I have ever owned, the ""buttery smooth"" slogan makes no sense."
