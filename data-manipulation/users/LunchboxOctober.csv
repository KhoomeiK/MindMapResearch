He was at a grocery store, near the deli counter, where a young guy - late teens / early twenties  (let's call him Mike) - and an older guy - in his 50s/60s, (let's call him Dave).  


So Dave is giving Mike shit for all the little things at the job, just like any ornery curmudgeon would. You know the type - they've been stuck in retail for decades and hate themselves and everyone. Well, Mike was being a good little gopher, fetching this thing or that thing for Dave, and he grabs a giant tub of Olives and puts it on the table next to Dave.  


Then, in a comedy of errors, the olives fall on the floor, open up spilling olives everywhere, the force of it splashes across the floor, soaking both of them. Dave is *livid.* He tears Mike a new one. Mike, a timid guy normally, is just fed up, goes into a long-winded 'fuck you, I quit' rant.

But to add insult to injury, he comes back with: ""this is why your fucking wife left you.""  


He then walks past my friend, gives him a crisp high-five, and moves onward to better things in life."

So, if you work  5 hours and one minute, and only got a ten minute, unpaid break, your employer has violated the the ESA (in Ontario it’s the ESA, other provinces have different legislation).

This is why many workplaces will force you to take a half hour break with a five hour shift since chances are you’ll work slightly more than that.

McDonalds, for example, provides paid 15s and unpaid 30s, and is *very* strict about when you go one break. In my youth I remember being made to take my half two hours into a 7-hour shift because thats when we had coverage."

**Every province mandates that every five hours of consecutive work must have a 30-minute break.** Nunavut, NWT and the Yukon are different and fall under the federal labor code, which does not mandate this. If you and your employer agree to divide the breaks up, you may take shorter breaks as long as you get still get a full thirty minutes.  


Before taking action through the Ministry, email your employer (so it's documented) that you have concerns regarding their break policy. If they do not change their policies to reflect labour laws, then you should go to the Ministry. Keep a log of any punitive actions they take against you during or after this period, as they cannot punish you for going to the Ministry."
