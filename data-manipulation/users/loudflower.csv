I used to listen to a podcast by a comic, but that got tiresome. I would have liked people to have shared their treatment strategies if they were comfortable.

A vlog format I like are ones that allow guests to skype in. That way folks don't have to schlep to a studio.

My two cents is to decrease the frequency of uploads. Once a month would be less pressure. As a youtube viewer, I couldn't commit to listening every day.

Is there a way to moderate comments or is it all or nothing? If so, turning the comments off would spare you and your real viewers from toxic comments (as OP pointed out)."
