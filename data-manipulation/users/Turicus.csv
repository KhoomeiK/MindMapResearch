personalfinance,ffpzha1,t3_euivlh,1580112316.0,"Don't take the travel costs as part of your salary package. First, it will affect taxes, and second, it incentivizes you to not take the trips, cause you keep the cash (not saying you'll do it, but the management will see the incentive structure). Separate the two things.

Just have them reimburse you, and make an estimate of what it will cost to go there, say, a week every three weeks.

You could also consider them paying your remote workplace (rent contribution, internet, phone etc.), even if you do it from home. It's a real cost, and a savings for them when you're not there.

Then offset that against your salary. You shouldn't be paying this, but if they already brought it up, and asked you to relocate, you could take a small cut in your base compensation, but not in your performance or equity compensation (if those exist). You could take a third (or half, or a quarter, up to you) of the commuting costs as a pay cut, but keep the miles.

I'd avoid travelling every week for 2-3 days, cause you'll hate it. Better to have whole weeks here and there.

If a hotel for 1 in 3 weeks is much cheaper than an apartment, you'll have to go with that. If it's about the same, definitely take the apartment. Much nicer to have ""your"" place to go to, even if it's small. You can leave stuff there rather than carrying it back and forth etc.

Choose a convenient carrier, credit card, hotel etc. and collect the points."

When in fact, most of his income is from YouTube. He probably made a scene in the video of cancelling the card.

I do agree people can be excessively restrictive with their spending. Sure, not spending money unnecessarily is very important for financial stability. But if you worry too much about inconsequential amounts, you won't be happy with your frugality either."

One of his old videos was about MSG. I tried to find it, but couldn't; he probably deleted it.

Basically, he was saying don't buy Muscle Milk whey because it's full of MSG. His argument was that its whey protein is full of glutamine, which is the same as MSG, which is bad for you.

This is factually wrong in so many places, that it's obvious he's a dumbass who doesn't know shit about nutrition, chemistry or science in general.

1. MSG is not bad for you. There's enough evidence out there. The scare was based on one spurious study decades ago.
2. Glutamine is not MSG, although the compounds have some chemical similarity.
3. Whey in Muscle Milk isn't different from whey in other protein powders.
4. All whey contains Glutamine. Proteins in general contain Glutamine. In fact, lots of food contains Glutamine, even foods we don't consider primary protein sources (like spinach, parsley or Papaya)."
