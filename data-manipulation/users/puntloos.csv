Good on you for actually doing it.."

vegan,ffsjb3y,t3_euut65,1580183089.0,"This 'exotic animal' stuff is a bit of a wildcard, yes you introduce more things into the arena, but there are also fewer chances to affect tons of animals at the same time. (e.g. 'monocultures')

For various reasons it's good to stop these practices but I suspect in the great scheme of things this stuff is vanishingly meaningless compared to the damage factory farming is doing"

vegan,ffs8fat,t1_ffs4v73,1580175685.0,"If the goal is animal welfare, you are no doubt right. Having Jared say loud and proud that he is 'basically vegan' is a BIG contributor to that cause. No, I don't approve of 'an occasional fish' but can't really quibble with the results.

But there is the social ingroup outgroup effects where people want to signal their own being part of the group and 'hate' on people who are not hitting some standards. Perfectly human too. Sadly it's not for the benefit of the animals to bicker in some 'no true scotsman' game"
vegan,ffs7f74,t1_ffs518n,1580174984.0,"This. The salmon statement is confusing, but at this point I guess I'm interpreting it as that some people have a 'fuck wildcard' where they can name one person (usually Brad Pitt or something..) that they're allowed to cheat with.

Anyway. assuming the best for a moment, humans are fallible, so striving for absolute perfection alienates literally everybody. What if you don't carry a broom to swipe bugs away from your feet and step on a couple? What about honey? Let's discuss products that contain some animal-based glue.. 

Sure, at some point you have to be out of the club, but you're a vegan to me if you typically don't eat any animal products and for whatever reason falter once per year."
AusFinance,ffs101l,t3_erc4o7,1580170506.0,"This article ignores one looming fact: we don't need more people. Anywhere. People hate to be limited, and I'd be fine discussing that it's all not fair (it probably isn't) but if 'fair' means that new humans should be able to build just as spaciously, live just as large as the previous generations, we're going to need a Planet B pretty soon.

Instead, if people aim to have only two kids, they can inherit the parents plot of land etc. Instead this article is just one more version of our 'growth oriented' economics that we need to get rid of sooner rather than later."

IAmA,ffj0ks9,t3_etr9mc,1579987357.0,"It's always been my impression that for various situations deemed 'conditions' - e.g. depression - that ""we all have these thoughts"". People who are depressed just have more acute strong feelings they are not able to deal with. Not diminishing their need for support at all, but it is not that they are 'alien' or experiencing life dramatically different.

Does this ring true? 

If this sort-of makes sense, how do you draw the line between 'normal, all of us feel this sometimes' and 'needs support', possibly having to accept the downsides of medicines too?"

offbeat,ff9ji83,t1_ff7vs2y,1579714336.0,"No idea why you were downvoted, but have one upvote. ;)

Getting pregnant due to costs is not a yes/no proposition, as with all 'costs' to things, it will never stop something completely- and we don't want people to never have kids - but reducing the amount of kids will certainly happen if externalized costs are billed to the parents. 

While i'm not a big fan of talking about 'rights', I think having kids is one of the core human needs that many people have, and I think having *one* kid is completely fine, and I think this ticks that 'human need' box.

The issue starts to mount when you start having more than that. 2 is arguably okay, but beyond that you are putting an undue burden on society which should not be free."
