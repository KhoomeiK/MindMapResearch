Another fact is our lack of places for the mentally ill to go. They have no where and don't even understand themselves well enough or what they have to do. Without recourse, they flounder even worse, and don't have anyone to stop them from going mad. ""Hey bud, this ain't healthy yo.""

InsurrectionEarth,ff07pm0,t1_fewzlz2,1579466103.0,"Ain't it beautiful. We have choice. Even better. There are ways to solve a problem not even god considered(well, he probably has, but I'm counting on this cosmic peek-a-boo we're in so please work with me here). Some of these solutions will may be really hard, obtuse, or even absurdly silly, but they are solutions all the same. Even if weaving a blanket, two patterns may well be markedly different. Its like New Vegas. What we cultivate helps determine our build and even what we can dip into and use.

We decide how we do things. 

It even means we have consequences and responsibility, in that the world responds to us and what we do. As the shards didn't just shatter after this world was born, never do we or what we do here. 

And even still if we fuck up. We still get the chance and choice to reflect on our failures and try something else. Diagnose the issue and find a solution. 

Best then its god knowing the hour and ultimate end. It understanding us and guiding us, giving our life its unique flavor.

I as it is am faced with choices. Even now realizing how many choices I have had and never even realized. Comments I shouldn't have made, things I'd written off that were actually really important, choices that I'm frankly lucky to have made, and turns in reality that are still giving me chills to this day. Even still, these are my choices and make my destiny my own. God isn't choosing for me here. And there are things sometimes the guide doesn't have a concrete answer on. Or even maybe the guide is wrong, and all I have left is myself, and trusting myself to make a good decision, and repenting and renewing in my own failure. Either sticking my doomed or blessed course, or charting a new way to my destination. As it is with you Nord and anyone else here. My choices are my own. However well informed they may be. Hence I am here, grateful I'm getting a new chance to find god again. And to make good of myself from these little paddles of mine. 

So I'd ask we head RD when it comes to these things. Tax reparations for the African Americans, underwater industry like mining, advanced communications using quantum physics and the plethora of interesting shit he's talked about over the years. He's said a lot. Maybe it ain't all agreeable(frankly it can be mean) but its at least worth a consideration and understanding. At least understanding the mechanics behind it, and why it all works, and why he thinks it work. We don't even have to do it(even if we should), just take on the principles of what he's said and put them into action, and save ourselves the trouble and heartache down the line. Understand what he means and why, and put it into actions. Even if its small shit as a phone call, at least its something! And not just sitting on one's thumbs. Something, if not even doing more. A letter, a call, a conversation, those things that tug at the weave and make things possible. Seek that shit out. That's what I'm trying. 

We are human here. And decide how we'll tackle the problems of the penultimate times. Grateful we can be then. To make our course and either prove it out, merge into another, or find a new and more interesting way."

InsurrectionEarth,feen8gz,t3_ef7fqm,1579037179.0,"Its concerning because China and other East Asian countries need such admonishments and voices against such body augmentations. Already the culture of plastic surgery and its modifications are a mainstay and cultural institution. Even worse when it involves following some celebrity, hoping to emulate their looks and appeal. To be desired like them. 

I remember I was in a classroom, and there was this girl who's desire was to change her nose.  She insisted t was ugly. 

Her nose was fine. Even as a gay man I saw this. She didn't need to change it. 

It was so odd to me seeing woman like her work so hard to change themselves to be beautiful and attract men. To be seen as beautiful, even if it means mutilating themselves. That the media there had such a stranglehold on people, ad that people where so willingly taking it because it was popular and because celebrity had it. No one caring if it was for health or function. 

I see the same sort of problem here. Where the bible is sanitized and controlled under governmental control. Where under a new cloak the same laws and bureaucracy of the Sanhedrin and the Roman will be used to control and carrel, when it was the redeemer who pushed against such evil to redirect us to the Kingdom of Heaven, not in Communism, nor the law, nor the land, but in us.
