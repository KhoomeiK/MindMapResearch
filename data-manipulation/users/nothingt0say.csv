BorderlinePDisorder,ffhbo0r,t1_ffh0pkh,1579929032.0,"No, I'm not offended. I didn't even know this was a thing until I found this subreddit. I am 42 yrs old. I have never been officially diagnosed w BPD, but I recognize alot of my behavior from my 20's in the list of symptoms. Most of those things, I have grown out of, forcing myself to change in order to survive. I have usually had a large group of acquaintance type friends, and then a handful of closer friends, plus 4 serious boyfriends, over the years. So I never directed my energy all on one person. I guess you could say I have many ""favorite people"" at any given time. But now, as an adult, I am aware of how I give back to my friends, so they do not feel the friendship is one sided. I work really hard at being a good listener, making people feel appreciated, and not being clingy or self absorbed."

schizophrenia,fff4xf6,t3_etaur3,1579875798.0,"It's an opiate type drug, acts on opiate receptors, so it is normal that it made you sleep. You probably took a bit too much. It's easy to do. When I share it with people who don't do opiates regularly I give them only a half teaspoon and wait about 45 mins. If they don't think it's enough I add another half tsp. 1 tsp is a nice pleasant buzz for a beginner. 

However, that stuff is addictive and like a real opiate, causes physical dependence and withdrawal once you get to the point where you are doing it every day. So' if you find yourself liking it, you gotta be real careful not to do it all the time!"
OpiatesRecovery,fff4n5e,t3_etapxl,1579875586.0,"It's so hard. You have to get yourself out of that life, cut all ties with product changing hands and whatnot. I'm struggling too.

Methadone,ffaed96,t1_ffa9zh0,1579733658.0,No they don't really care but they would probably still pull your take home for crack. Once a month is realistic as far as testing goes. If she's using she has gotten lucky and hasn't tested positive.

OpiatesRecovery,ff9cmd0,t3_es9o0l,1579709977.0,"You could go from a gram to a half a gram to a quarter to and eight and then done. The taper schedule isn't hard or complicated.

I agree wholeheartedly with the above comment. We don't understand our minds very well. Some of what you perceive as mind reading may be exactly that, some of it may be hallucination or delusions. Don't get too hung up on trying to figure out what's what, as tempting as it is. The best thing is to figure out how to make this stop happening, as it is very distracting at best and can be terrifying at worst."
