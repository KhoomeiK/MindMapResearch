Also, you really need to lower your expectations about spending time together. I get it, my husband and I do LDR a lot for his schooling and I definitely get resentful, but at the end of it it's not really about us - they would rather be with us but they made a commitment to school and if they can't succeed because of personal time management that is not good."

Chefit,ffsnw65,t1_ffrexfk,1580186611.0,"Maybe artichoke hearts? Like New Orleans artichoke hearts (although those are usually canned marinated in vinaigrette) - you pulse them and then mix in breadcrumbs, and parmesan like cheese, and form into balls with more breadcrumbs on the outside. Hard to plate though, with the vinaigrette taste. There is a olive mix here that some places put on salad that might mix well (I'm thinking grilled romaine, olive mix vinaigrette drizzle and artichoke balls garnished, needs something crunchy though)."
