Having 80-90% etc genetic similarity though is describing a shared base makeup, and thus a (very) distant shared ancestry as a result of being the same species however many eras back.

Shortened: one is describing the mixing of species, the other is describing the overall similarity between different species due to a common ancestor.

Hope that makes sense."
