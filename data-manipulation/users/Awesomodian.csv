hockey,fddtt6u,t1_fc6901v,1578323800.0,"I guess you haven't been paying any attention to hockey this past decade?.  Though using soccer as a comparison has some applicability ;  In both sports it turns out shots from the sides of the field/rink and or farther away from the net are significantly less likely to go in especially with players in the way. Teams know this and especially less skilled teams exploit it to great effect against superior teams, by essentially sitting back covering right around the net/middle of ice/18 yard box and this leads to boring games of perimeter shots and few high danger scoring chances. Think spain at the height of thier prowess only winning by 1 constantly against much lesser competition, chile playing for shootouts against Argentina 2x in row in the COPA or the 2014 Olympic hockey tournament ( which was basically the final thing that tipped the scales in favour of smaller ice)

For the last 15yrs speed and skill has been increasingly emphasized to the point where they are now the most important qualities for all players. Have you not seen this?
