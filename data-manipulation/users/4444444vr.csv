I always hated that kind of self righteous bs.

I just loved the simplicity of it. The MDX felt complicated and fragile compared to the 4Runner. I had over 150k on the 4Runner and the mechanic who looked it over before I sold it just was like, “Well...nothing is wrong with it. Should just keep going another 150k”

The way I treated it though I kind of thought something should have been wrong with it but...nope. The MDX on the other hand never left pavement and needed the AC and the transmission replaced before 75k.

I’m surprised you don’t care for the looks of the Telluride, it is so raved about lately that I guess I just expect everyone to be a fan. Of course, it and the Palisade are basically the same value proposition and if you have already ruled that out then no point in looking at its twin when you don’t care for the look. 

I am a fan of the X5 and the 4Runner and totally understand your thoughts on the latter. I had a 4Runner years ago and it was just so functional and reliable that I loved it like a pet dog and I still feel dumb for selling it. Also, the back window rolls down just like every SUV’s should. I am annoyed by Toyota on some things with it but the thing is awesome and I follow a number of ridiculous 4Runner accounts on Instagram just to imagine a daily driver that can also be overlanded at a moments notice. 

So...I guess I’m not offering any help here. I guess my parting thought is I’ve never talked to anyone in an RX or a 4Runner that has really had any regrets. I can’t say that about an X5, not that I’m saying don’t get the X5, but personally I don’t think it provides enough to justify the cost over your other top 3 at the moment.
