That was a stupid resolution, I would hope any reasonable fan wouldn't want the titles awarded to the Dodgers arbitrarily. I mean you have to strip the title if you want to show that you're not allowed to cheat though, on a basic level you can't tell everyone they can't cheat and then recognize a champion that cheated.

dataisbeautiful,ff7cj3g,t1_ff79uvs,1579646375.0,"This seems like a pretty easy one to explain right? If there’s roughly a 50% chance of going left or right at each peg, then there are lots of ways to get down to the middle (LRLRLR, LLLRRR, LLRRRL, etc) but there’s only one way to get to the right edge (RRRRRR) or the left edge (LLLLLL). Even though the paths or combinations taken by the beads should be roughly evenly distributed, the final locations should be normally distributed because more paths/combinations lead to the center.  
  
I do get that your comment is more about seeing the normal distribution everywhere, which is cool, I was just thinking this shouldn’t have been too hard for your teacher to explain."

nfl,ff23e1c,t1_ff22ldq,1579492710.0,"I think it was *mostly* other factors. The o-line was bad, our starting LT and center were injured, as well as both our starting fullback and 2nd string FB. I think those and other minor injuries (and the revolving door at receiver) made it harder for the offense to gel early in the year and it just never really came together.  
  
That said, there were times Brady looked like he was 42. He played very smart and would throw the ball away early a lot to avoid getting hit, but every once in a while he would miss a throw that I don’t think he would have missed before. He still moves super well in the pocket to avoid sacks and I would take him over any other reasonably available qb out there though, I still think playing to 45 at a high level is very realistic for him. If you ask another pats fan you might get a different answer though haha."
