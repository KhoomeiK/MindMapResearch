AskReddit,ffjdjes,t3_etsjhz,1579996009.0,The part of the brain that causes the abnormal motor movement in people with Parkinson’s and Huntington’s(globus pallidus internal) causes this when it is “activated”. So people without these diseases have this part of the brain permanently inhibited and therefore normal motor movement.  Scientists have no idea why this part of the brain even exists.

depression,feixmez,t3_ep842q,1579150040.0,"I feel this so hard.  I had a best friend for a little while, but now she’s gone and I don’t know what to do without someone who’s always gonna be there and who’s always gonna get it.  I’m lucky to have family that cares, but I’ve sort of spent most of my life feeling like to love me and to understand me are mutually exclusive things."
depression,fehz4p0,t1_fehyb22,1579126804.0,"Ugh I feel you.  I’m not afraid to go places alone with the intention of meeting people.  But genuine connections have always been hard for me to make, platonic or romantic."
depression,fehvq17,t3_eoygo4,1579124818.0,"I get those.  I think it’s from dehydration, so I try to keep a water bottle nearby at all times.  But yeah, splitting headaches after already feeling like garbage suck."

Drugs,f2yz3s6,t3_det7j7,1570501980.0,"Not exactly an expert, but from what I know about SSRIs, they take at least a month to kick in, you need to take a consistent amount at consistent intervals, and if/when you plan on no longer taking the drug, you should TAPER off of it, not stop taking it all at once.  So they’re not exactly usable as a “recreational” drug.  I’d recommend finding a psychiatrist and a therapist for your depression, psychopharmacology is tricky and should be handled by professionals."
