aww,fg0sr91,t1_fg0rx9l,1580414291.0,"There are multiple peer reviewed studies that have concluded that pitbulls are not innately more aggressive than any other breed. 

[""Breed differences in canine aggression"" by Deborah L.Duffy, YuyingHsu, and James A.Serpell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159108001147) is probably the most well known.

There are many more you can find with a 15 second google search *if* you were ever inclined to learn about this subject."
aww,fg0r3i4,t1_fg0q5ya,1580413368.0,People are emotional when they use statistics incorrectly in an attempt to prove a point the facts don't support.
aww,fg0priu,t1_fg0mgwb,1580412631.0,"Coloration does not equal causation. 

But you know that and are making a bad faith, emotional argument."

CAguns,ffxfsjv,t1_ffx1j4f,1580324269.0,"RINO has been an interesting one for me as it really represents what is wrong with identity politics consolidating to a choice between two parties. 

Over the last 20-25 years the Republican party has shifted their focus to reactionary policies on social issues and de-emphasized the importance of actual fiscal conservatism. 

Most of my favorite conservatives over the years , while trying to be sane moderates, have been dubbed RINOs  for failing to toe the party line on whatever the white-trash outrage de jour is (abortion, immigration, transgender rights, ect)."
libertarianmeme,ffv5ot0,t1_ffv4oq2,1580256281.0,"Locke's Natural Law is quite literally a response to Divine Law, which is what you're describing throughout this post and seem to be a fan of. 

Natural law has nothing to do with a ""Creator"" and Locke argued it's defining characteristic is that Natural Law can be discovered by reason alone."
libertarianmeme,ffv4heh,t1_ffv3qst,1580255465.0,"Natural rights, as defined by Locke, are inalienable rights that intrinsic to natural law. 

If you want to try to wedge Jebus in the to satisfy an emotional need you have you can, but religion is not pertinent to nor does it have any affect on Natural Rights."
libertarianmeme,ffv3521,t1_ffutx1l,1580254585.0,"[You backed up your reasoning in another thread by appealing to an imaginary authority.](https://old.reddit.com/r/libertarianmeme/comments/evac14/rights_you_keep_using_that_word_i_dont_think_it/ffuoe5m/) 

I'm no fan of the UN, but that's certainly a better example than the Flying-spaghetti-monster theory you provided. 

I'd suggest taking your theology out of this. There is a wealth of thought and literature on where Natural Rights come from."
