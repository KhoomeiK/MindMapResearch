This is all highly hypothetical, she'd need to have had worries about being treated so, or have had incidents in the past, and have some conversations recorded with the business confirming they knew of the situation. 

Even recorded conversations aside, if they set up a known attractive woman outside a club that hosts mainly single men, and something happened to her, they'd probably lose the lawsuit. 

It all depends if they knew or how dangerous the situation was. Was she alone outside? Did they check on her enough?, can you prove they were aware in any way shape or form? Did they make an off comment at the interview? ""Oh the customers are gonna LOOooooOOVE you"" ""If they get handzy, just give em a little shove"" Did something else happen that they complained about? 

But yes, the establishment is always liable for almost anything that happens on the property. If someone walked in the front door and shot people and you tripped trying to escape out the back and broke your leg, the establishment is liable.
