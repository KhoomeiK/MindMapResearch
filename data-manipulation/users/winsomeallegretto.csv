widowers,fgb6bqb,t3_exf44i,1580658894.0,"I didn't find out that my husband had been abusing alcohol and vaping for the past year until he was in the hospital dying from the consequences. We were always so happy together and I thought everything was so perfect, so I had to deal with the fact that he had been lying to me at the same time as being utterly devastated that he was gone. Im trying so hard not to let that taint the good memories."
bulletjournal,fg85nb2,t1_fg7wh2r,1580610170.0,Thanks!
bulletjournal,fg7f0j6,t1_fg7c8m5,1580590908.0,Thanks! Lol gotta have a little bit of hope springing up.
IASIP,fg4jwal,t1_fg4j1vm,1580504776.0,Haha it kinda does. I should have posted a screenshot of the title rather than a link. Oh well.
GriefSupport,ffylgmf,t3_evt68a,1580349247.0,"I feel for you. Your friend sounds a lot like my husband (around the same age too, I'm assuming). He was the sweetest and kindest person, but he had a lot of demons as well and tried to fight them with alcohol and other things. I really wish he would have let me know how much he was struggling; we were so open about everything else. I guess there is no point in regretting. I just don't understand why the good ones have to go so soon."
GriefSupport,ffvmyuk,t3_evebdt,1580267938.0,Sleep Forever by Portugal. The Man. It was my husband's favorite song. Also Love Like You by Rebecca Sugar. We both loved it and it meant a lot to us. I played both songs for him on his death bed and I really think they made him more peaceful.

musicmemes,ffihvnp,t3_etmheh,1579974248.0,God this hurts. My husband was like a genius musician and he died a couple months after he turned 27. He seemed to know it was going to happen all his life too.
cats,fff6h5i,t1_fff3284,1579876934.0,Uhhhh I think you're thinking of Leeta.
bulletjournal,femwwg6,t3_epzn2x,1579271734.0,"It's really pretty, but ... Not to be rude ... The dates are off. Just thought someone should point it out so you don't make the same mistake next week."
childfree,fed9g1g,t3_eocsx2,1579004627.0,"I never wanted to get married either. As a young adult my parents would say things like ""how are you preparing yourself to be a good wife."" Like uhhhhh I don't even know what that means. When I met my (late) husband I was shocked that a relationship could be a partnership between two people and that we didn't expect each other to change to confirm to gender roles. My mom once asked me ""does he feel threatened that you have a higher degree than him?"" He loved that about me."
classicalmusic,fe43nfo,t1_fe3zdtm,1578855494.0,Except well temperament isn't equal temperament.
stevenuniverse,fe0ajap,t1_fdwrp1p,1578807807.0,Duh...I was agreeing with you.
stevenuniverse,fdwptlb,t1_fdwlqj7,1578761221.0,"My understanding of this episode is that the entire plan to go to Empire City was to get Pearl to open up through a full blown musical number. Empire City=NYC=Broadway. Near the end Pearl says ""why did we even come? We could have done this at home."" But that's not exactly true. They needed the musical format to get Pearl to open up (through her revelatory 11-o'clock number) and to reconcile with Greg."
PrequelMemes,fdc4jn6,t3_ekgubn,1578266971.0,Upvoting because my husband would have loved this.
