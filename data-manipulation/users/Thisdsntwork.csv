Warthunder,ffpdhm1,t3_eugtjb,1580092316.0,I fucking hate how badly the Swifts and Hunters suffer from brakes made of cheese.
technology,ffp3mz6,t1_ffoiqj7,1580085626.0,Part of that is because you don't want the enemy to know exactly how your radios/other SI electronics work though.
mildlyinfuriating,ffnjpr8,t1_ffn7pvz,1580066858.0,Make it a timelapse.
mildlyinteresting,ffj9sgb,t1_ffizvdh,1579993778.0,Until the Marines show up. No more crayon coating.
worldnews,fffve2v,t1_ffftqmj,1579892629.0,"I hope you dont like Porsche, BMW, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi to name a few if that's the case."
modernwarfare,ffes25s,t1_ffersz8,1579862777.0,Except this isnt the first time there have been unannounced changes. It's happened every update.
modernwarfare,ffemdbh,t1_ffdpdnp,1579854302.0,So what you're saying is either the team that pushes out the patches or the team that writes the patch notes is incompetent? Got it.
modernwarfare,ffcnxg0,t3_esskdw,1579803480.0,"Small indie dev, stop giving them a hard time guys."
modernwarfare,ffbia21,t1_ffaz68h,1579766563.0,"Thermite doesnt care about the ""physics"" (lol) of the game. It does a set amount of damage per damage tick and that's it. It doesnt have to melt the fuselage of the aircraft and then break the flight controls causing it to spin out of control as it catches on fire from fuel contacting thermite. It just fucking runs out of hp and that's it."
modernwarfare,ff9tuw8,t1_ff9rwrq,1579721158.0,"At this point whenever I hear ""big update"" I cry for my computer's storage space, with very little to show for it in-game."
modernwarfare,ff7hfvy,t1_ff7gzv1,1579649631.0,It's a really big crossbow.
blackdesertonline,ff7h8j5,t1_ff6qtec,1579649497.0,Probably means that since mats will sell for more now his profit goes up.
instantkarma,ff5j7zn,t1_ff5j6co,1579595408.0,Damn I missed that chance.
instantkarma,ff5gwgt,t1_ff561io,1579592342.0,"Because it's extra cost, weight, mechanical components, and not everyone needs 4x4."
instantkarma,ff5eqdc,t1_ff532qr,1579589710.0,It's definitely near the peek of common mispellings.
Warthunder,ff4afns,t1_ff2cim1,1579559062.0,It's like a rocket Kitakami.
JustBootThings,fezd0za,t3_eqo7o8,1579456057.0,Oh hey an Uber flyer.
modernwarfare,feuoddm,t1_fes692y,1579388435.0,Works best with naval weaponry against turtle back armor.
modernwarfare,fem049e,t1_fel53fu,1579235521.0,"Ah yes, argue realism while ignoring a minigun with infinite ammo."
blackdesertonline,felexxl,t1_fekms70,1579220580.0,30 day restriction.
todayilearned,feiuna5,t1_feinno4,1579147671.0,"I think that's just meant to be sun glare off of the spinning blades, seeing as the C-130A was 4 blades per engine"
todayilearned,feijsbm,t1_feidv69,1579140160.0,"MiG-25s can actually reach that height, and technically similar speeds, but the engines destroy themselves when they get that fast. And to intercept you have to overcome the SR-71s headstart."
todayilearned,feii134,t1_feifzud,1579138999.0,"Well, they would know the area it would be coming down in, and the Air Force still uses C-130s today, albeit a newer model."
blackdesertonline,feiadm7,t1_fei4qbu,1579133874.0,Wao 2edgy5me.
2007scape,fefshpa,t1_fefeju2,1579063863.0,And then another one logs in.
2007scape,fed1sqm,t1_feczy2c,1578994413.0,"Relax, Kemp. You'll get that 19cb cape one day."
modernwarfare,fec6p0j,t1_feapp7p,1578967566.0,"They used to use EAC as well and it was the same story, rampant cheating everywhere in combat arms."
HistoryMemes,fe751vc,t1_fe6kvqk,1578910126.0,That and at high enough speeds the engines were likely to run out of control until they broke themselves.
modernwarfare,fdrscym,t1_fdrfd49,1578688943.0,Gotta get lucky with the shop rotations.
modernwarfare,fdrs0oy,t1_fdrfge0,1578688894.0,Now that's what I call triggered ^TM
modernwarfare,fdrek8q,t1_fdrd6lx,1578683438.0,"And they're nowhere near as bright IRL as they are in-game, hence, laser guns."
modernwarfare,fdrc98t,t1_fdr7blb,1578682470.0,Drunk and deployed? Something doesnt add up.
modernwarfare,fdrc5kn,t1_fdqzqvw,1578682433.0,Oden and Aug
modernwarfare,fdrc100,t1_fdqptwz,1578682364.0,So do you still play? Cause they added 2 packs that have laser gun blueprints so I think this isnt the game for you.

worldnews,fdogfzg,t1_fdo6n84,1578604641.0,"On the contrary, they can glide incredibly well. When you design something to fly at several hundred mph you make it aerodynamic since you have to spend fuel to get it to that speed and hold it. And the more lift you create the more weight you can carry."
modernwarfare,fdik9y7,t1_fdhzcdl,1578444790.0,But in ground war there's no chance they push too far and the spawns flip. It was like Piccadilly A side but worse.
modernwarfare,fdh8b9k,t1_fdh7ihp,1578417549.0,It's a 1shot in HC.
modernwarfare,fd9z2be,t1_fd9t6o2,1578239758.0,It runs just fine for me and I dont have hyperthreading. But yeah the PC version of the game needs some work.
blackdesertonline,fd6xa17,t3_ek79l0,1578196869.0,Do you have your quests filtered?
2007scape,fd4dh0t,t1_fcz6cea,1578166593.0,"""Forward thinking""

I'm theorizing a lvl 3 vorkath kill right now, gotta say, I'm a bit of a forward thinker."
blackdesertonline,fcz8s4a,t1_fcz1dlq,1578095970.0,As you reach higher levels the quests to kill mobs for them give you a higher grade reward.
JustBootThings,fcyhsvs,t1_fcx98xz,1578080405.0,Had a guy drink pine-sol to try and get them to process him out faster.
modernwarfare,fcy9z93,t1_fcxr1og,1578076876.0,That's exactly what he said...
AskReddit,fcy774u,t1_fcy0xg9,1578075807.0,He's just a man out to get his revenge.
AskReddit,fcy659d,t1_fcy3xs8,1578075293.0,"""Well I never even noticed that my nose was pointed east, and that Iranian fighter pilot was surprised to say the least."""
Warthunder,fcy4eml,t1_fcxc08l,1578074579.0,Because it's not German and only German SPAA is allowed to kill tanks at low tier.
2007scape,fcy37na,t1_fcxwjtr,1578074136.0,Yeah it's closer to Final Fantasy's ATB than a true turn-based.
modernwarfare,fcwt1td,t1_fcw02mx,1578036446.0,"But the trap in crash involves the interaction between doors and the riot shield, not between 2 players, so it doesn't even fix the issue."
modernwarfare,fcwsy48,t1_fcwrby2,1578036330.0,Should add fumbled reloads and specific magazine ammo counts to make this guy happy.
modernwarfare,fcsp52a,t1_fcso1hu,1577921573.0,"His comment is actually well thought out and makes a great point. It's not just ""whining""."
modernwarfare,fcqtw3y,t1_fcqjdai,1577892133.0,Proper anti-cheat and EAC. That's a good one.
modernwarfare,fcqtf3h,t1_fcqjrij,1577891923.0,"Great argument. You really convinced me. I'm not sure what you convinced me of, but you convinced me."
modernwarfare,fcmc6bu,t3_ehyhni,1577770180.0,And there's a VLK 3.0 optic thats 3x zoom so not sure where the typo is on this one.
modernwarfare,fcazms0,t3_egwhu4,1577579762.0,So that they don't have to run a ranked mode. Small indie dev team probably cant afford the extra servers.
