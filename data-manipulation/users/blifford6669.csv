humanresources,feji5ft,t3_ep9o2v,1579175307.0,"Congratulations! Just learn as much as you can, and remember you’re here to learn so it’s a space you can grow in- don’t feel threatened by “not knowing what you think you should know by now” because we all start somewhere. An internship is a great learning experience and a wonderful career opportunity. You seem like you’re taking it seriously and I hope your hard work is rewarding and fulfilling. You got this!!!"
DecidingToBeBetter,fejhziw,t3_eph1sb,1579175104.0,"Hey :) I just wanted to say, I’ve been there, and you’re welcome to DM me if you need any advice. I struggled with a similar experience, and my best advice I can give is making friends that will do productive things with you, or healthier things. I also suggest taking time for something you have an interest in that is constructive to society, like volunteering at a shelter or working a part time job. Cutting back on drinking seems hard, but once you put socialization in perspective and budget that time as you would anything else like an appointment, you can start to get control over it. It’s not easy but what I’m trying to say is seeking healthy control over your lifestyle is well worth it. I sought therapy for exactly this. It was really helpful to learn how to budget my time and spend time with my friends out on weekends and get my sh*t together during the week. Again, DM me if you need anything! Im always here to listen without judgement and offer any advice I can as a woman who just went thru the same thing"
unpopularopinion,fejhqpr,t3_eph6e5,1579174791.0,"I completely agree with this. Someone mentioned the punishment should fit the crime, and made the point that arguing that it should be lesser than when harming a human. I agree with you, but that comment made me think about how this idea would be enforced. It would be hard to distinguish between harming animals and what we consider farming, or using animals as a food source. 
I agree, but I wanted to bring this idea to the discussion as this would be a difficult boundary to establish."
aww,fejhjyw,t1_feir9q1,1579174551.0,And what an awesome idea you perpetuated!! Love it

NoStupidQuestions,fejdhep,t1_feitbog,1579168657.0,Can I ask if you know which nutrients we tend to lack in an average day-to-day diet that we should be supplementing?

AmItheAsshole,fe3tyhy,t3_eno5q8,1578852842.0,"NTA - you’re taking a prescribed medication. You’re taking it at the time directed by a doctor. What the medicine does is none of his business. Also, there are people take birth control for more than just preventing ovulation; rude of him to comment on it as he’s making an uninformed judgement about someone else’s prescription."
