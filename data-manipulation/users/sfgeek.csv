The best thing would be to get him in an fMRI and ask him a bunch of questions Psychologically experts and brain experts could study. The results on him would be so informative, because there are thousands of tweets that could be matched to control questions."

I do believe though, that code is a form of art. Without even looking at change logs from who wrote what on a team, I know who wrote it. I can see hubris, shyness and more. The impatience, arrogance or the consideration.
Code shows the personality of the author. Are you by the rules? Or impatient, arrogant or scared?
The best teams are a mix of bold thinkers who really push the envelope, and logical planners. I ran teams and always wanted a mix. My job? Manage those personalities with a clear goal and be the bridge to all the other teams. My job was keep internal politics off their radar so they could focus."

Open all the windows to the plane so they can split and track hostages vs. hijackers. If you are ever on a hijacked plane try to keep your window shield up as long as possible.

I would be shocked if US Airports didn’t have very long range lenses connected to the Internet to get images of the state of Pax’s state. Airports are, despite the TSA letting something like 95% of weapons through, a hard target. That stupid body scanner? Doesn’t work well. Dogs? They work very well. It’s about 15k to train a dog that can alert to explosives and other chemicals. That’s peanuts in the big picture.

Source: I worked in Computer and Physical Security. Our job was to get hired to find holes in these things. Sadly, sometimes that meant manipulation of honest Americans to find holes in their security. I always took them out for a meal after on me and tuned my report to always say “Extremely common mistake.” I stopped working in that industry. I didn’t like building trust to hack them (at the behest of their bosses, who actually weren’t bad people, they needed good guys to punch holes before the bad guys did. I was a “White Hat” hacker."

I have never been a “car on car”moving real accident until recently. I had been sedated for outpatient surgery and was told “don’t drive for 24 hours.” I didn’t for 25 hours. Scraped this girls bumper that was parked I’ve never done that. I realized my depth perception was still off from surgery, I thought my vision seemed fine. Nope.
27 years, and I hadn’t ever bumped a moving car. Ok, on race tracks yes, but never on public streets. You’re going to hit bumpers on a track. The whole point is everyone on the track knows what they signed up for.
