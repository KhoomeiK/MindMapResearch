trashy,ffbnnps,t1_ffas8r7,1579774492.0,"Sad to say this is quite similar to my reality at the moment.  Only in hospital for 24hrs.  Don’t remember trying to kill myself.  Didn’t succeed in case any of you were curious.  I don’t feel like myself if I don’t have a drink.  It’s to the point where I’m hiding it in my car and sneak outside when my girl is asleep to guzzle straight vodka.  Disgusting right?  I thought so too years ago but now it’s almost the best fucking relief I feel.  Not sure how to get out of this slump, not sure I can, quite frankly at this point it seems like I’d almost prefer to drink myself to death.  But hey, I’m just wallowing one self pity right, grow up right?  Shut the fuck up you’re fine right?  

I truly wish I could remember how to be me again.  Remember who the fuck I am.  

Kudos to all who have overcome this shit.

Sincerely, 

A 23(m) FUCK UP!"

cocaine,fdq7yx9,t1_fdq7bjy,1578658649.0,"Ha no kidding, my old man is very successful as well.  Hard shoes to fill that’s for sure.  Nothing wrong with grinding to make a name for yourself, I’ve been burned at the last 3 jobs trying to work my way to the top.  Yes I still drank and turned up but I ALWAYS made it to work on time and did my best to outwork coworkers.  Just comes down to politics at the end and that’s disheartening.  

In my opinion it’s better to crush some on the job working experience and then go to school for the education.  If you can back up experience with a degree or diploma in my opinion you’ve got er made."

cocaine,fdq73uv,t1_fdq6pk9,1578657691.0,"HA!!! That’s to a fucking tee what I did.... partied my ass off and dropped out after 2 years.  I still don’t know what I wanna do.  THE WORST PART is the god damn boomers don’t quite understand what the fuck our problem is.  Lol at least for my situation.  Times are friggen different and we have nowhere near the opportunity they had.  Either you invent something wicked, a YouTube sensation, IG famous, or a camgirl... if you’re not you’re pretty much fucked lol."

Either you’ll pull yourself out of it and make some serious changes in order to kick some ass or simply it’s just not the right time for that change.  If you’re not ready (for whatever reason) there is no shame in taking the time to tackle some demons and come out 10x stronger, if you’re not ready you’re not ready!"

cocaine,fdq5uvw,t1_fdq5buk,1578656203.0,"Dang dude, your attitude towards it all is friggen spot on.  I’m 23 and the shit I’ve been through is bloody awful BUT like you said it all matters because it makes us who we are.  It’s our fucking identity.  

Also congrats on the 2 weeks!  That can be a challenge depending on how far in a hole one is.  

We’ll catch a break one of these days lol.  Can’t ever lose that hope"
