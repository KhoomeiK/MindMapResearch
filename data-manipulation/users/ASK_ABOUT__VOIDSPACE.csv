mildlyinteresting,ffxsre6,t1_ffxqg6z,1580331689.0,"> What gameplay elements will be front and center?

Definitely the invention system and player interactions through trade, stores, just giving someone a lift from one place to another...etc. It's important to understand that we're not really trying to make a game but rather a human society simulator. Think Ready Player One, but not just a series of minigames - instead it's a living and breathing game world that resembles our own. Players build it from raw resources. 

> You describe it as survival, but will there be multiplayer battles?

Absolutely. Hopefully EVE-scale battles one day will be waged. That said there is quite a lot to lose so I do hope civility becomes the norm once player states have been established.

>  Open world combat? 

Yup. If you really want to get away you can just spawn in the ""middle of no where"" but there will always be a small chance of being found one day by an enterprising individual.

> Instanced battlegrounds?

Na, none of that. We're talking about a raw virtual universe what you see is what you get.


> Anywhere I can go to look up info on classes, ships, crafting, and combat mechanics?

This kind of stuff will be generally discovered and documented by players. Best place to start is to join the Discord and hook up with some people. They've started wikis and spreadsheets and things, but I'm generally hands-off of that stuff.

That said, there are no classes per-se. Your character can certainly specialize but a person's ""class"" is no more defined than it is in real life.

> 
> Also, serious question, what makes this game stand out? In your words, what makes it not just another WoW clone?

I hope we are introducing a sorely needed genre to the gaming world and I hope to one day play games like this made by other studios.

> 
> I’m definitely intrigued by what you’re doing and may give it a try.

Come one, come all! We need people to test things out and I hope you have fun while doing it. Make sure to join the Discord so we can work with you while we're in early access.
