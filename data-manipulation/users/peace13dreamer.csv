SuicideWatch,fdk9065,t1_fdk5a6q,1578498805.0,But it takes a lot more balls to suicide.
SuicideWatch,fdhg10r,t3_elewpp,1578421864.0,Not early but in my late teen (19) I came very close to death twice. I had passed most of the obstacles but in the finishing line I reversed because of pain and fear. This is why in my next attempt I’m going with a method I can’t reverse.
SuicideWatch,fdh4oe0,t3_eldu34,1578415307.0,Suicide is a personal decision so I can’t say do it or don’t. But I wish you the best in whatever decision you make.
SuicideWatch,fdguzaq,t3_elc8vs,1578408986.0,Last year I thought about killing 2 men who made us suffer then quickly kill myself. But I didn’t have gun (still don’t). The desire came when I heard someone who live not that far from my home killed someone and tried to kill himself. Currently I don’t have the desire.
