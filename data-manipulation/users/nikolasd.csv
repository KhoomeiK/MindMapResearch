Python,ffi6jo0,t1_ffhtssh,1579966416.0,"Allow me to put it this way. It is a container running on a virtual machine that can be programmed to behave as whatever you need. For instance, you need a LAMP stack environment, you load a LAMP stack docker machine and voila! There's your own LAMP stack server running on your machine without the need to setup everything on your own. I found a decent tutorial that will get you started here, https://docker-curriculum.com/ and a great article here https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-guide-to-docker-how-to-create-your-first-docker-application-cc03de9b639f/"

YouShouldKnow,fey9y34,t1_fexspz5,1579442748.0,"Of course you are comfortable, because ignorance and accepting that fragments of a work of art are equal to the whole work is what differences Anglo-Saxons by nations who have actually created civilization. After all you still believe that you are an Empire. As for the Turks (actually, then they were called Ottomans), I can still see much of the Parthenon and the Agia Sophia still standing, but for the Parthenon Aetomata, i see that, you should be trained again on how to handle them properly. Also, get to know, that the process of extraction by Elgin, caused more damages to the building than the Ottomans. You are not the Greatest Nation of the world, you are not even an empire,  stop acting like the whole world owes you, because frankly, you owe to more than 15 nations! Although English music is great, so as you are the birthplace of some of the greatest scientists of the world."
YouShouldKnow,fexlu4w,t1_fewzf9a,1579433112.0,"This is the reasoning you give to justify the fact that Elgin is just a noble thief? The Parthenon, the Taj Mahal and many other exceptional artifacts, buildings and work of arts - not created by your civilization - still stand greatly on their position. Actually, any work of civilization not ""rescued"" by any noble English guy, is in a better state than the ""rescued"" ones."
