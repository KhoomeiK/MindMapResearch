While their agenda might not be openly nazi, a lot of the members of the AFD are directly linked to neo-nazi ideology and groups. There have been countless inexusable statements by their members of state parliaments and they are openly opposed to the democratic process. They are actively working on making nazi vocabular useable in public. They are actively provoking devision within the state and pitting the poor against each other.

They don't actually provide feasable solutions.

Just my 2 cents."
