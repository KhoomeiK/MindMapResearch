worldnews,ffofaa6,t1_ffnquxz,1580077090.0,"FDA trials are overkill as they are. The EU and JP are just as safe with fewer restrictions. All other countries accept FDA trials but the FDA only accepts FDA trials. 

It's important to remember the FDA was created as a reactionary agency while the JP and were created much later and learned from the FDA. The FDA is very slow to change and requires a ridiculous amount of clinical participants compared to their peers. Let's put it this way in 2012 the FDA had yet to embrace molecular methods while the JP and EU had been using them for years. 

There are pediatric drugs and vaccines stuck in clinical death holds because in order to complete the trials they need tens of thousands of participants while the drugs and vaccines are available for adults for years. It's hard to find participants that both sign up and stay in the program for the required timeframes."
worldnews,ffmrnjy,t1_ffmg1jc,1580058228.0,"That's actually an argument for a vaccination where you can add adjuvant that enhances the immune response. Also original antigenic sin =/= no response just diminished immunogenicity and a immune preference to utilize a more passive approach. This is a known flaw of the innate immune system of almost all animals on earth. 

When you make vaccines you actually measure the immunogenicity of your vaccine candidates and if each stain in that vaccine. You take the anti-serum of animal and clinical samples and determine the titer of live virus they inactivated in cell culture assays. So you get a good idea of how effective the vaccine is against those targets. There is also a lot of data on death rates of vaccinated individuals and unvaccinated individuals. That data shows a clear preference for vaccination."
politics,ffmens1,t1_ffkxfs1,1580053465.0,"That's the problem when you have a run away branch of government like we have had with the executive for the past hundred + years. When you allow blanket disregard for the law where do you draw the line of it taken too far. We need Congress to take back the power it has allowed the executive to usurp. We need Congress to censure, legislate and impeach unlawful and unconstitutional presidents regardless of allegiances to red and blue. Without consequences each successive president will grab more and more power. 

This is why we are where we are. We elect Kings for 4 years and is only now occurring to people the seriousness after we elected our first mad king. There will be more if this just ends in impeachment but Congress doesn't reign in executive power."
worldnews,ffmd8hg,t1_ffl16t5,1580052749.0,"That's the way the immune system works. Even if the vaccine is off target your still better off because it has some knowledge of the virus in your active immune system. It means the lag time from infection to antibody production should still be faster than a completely new pathogen. This is why as you age the flu ravages you less and less but every so often a stain that hasn't circulated in decades might cause severe illness. This was the case of the swine flu of 2009. H1N1 hadn't been a global stain for 40+ years, so those with severe life threatening symptoms were the young. Normally the flu kills the old and the very young, but in 2009 the deaths were seen in the young and middle aged. Bird flu is another dangerous stain because the general population hasn't seen this stains yet. 

The more exposure your immune system has to viral species the quicker and more accurate the response will be. So even an off target vaccinated person is likely to have a quicker and stronger immune response than a immune naive individual."

That's the difference here, Reagan had plausible deniability, Clinton had popularity and legalese, Bush's misconduct was really only revealed at the very end of his presidency and his popularity succeeded drastically, Obama's was only called out by a select few because the people and parties were in agreement with his actions. 

Trump's on the other hand is indefensible. He is brazen about it and his supporters get distracted by ""but Hillary"" but if you remove the Trump name are very against it.

worldnews,ffhjfar,t3_etinqx,1579937991.0,"last time a pandemic, streamlined approval, monovalent vaccine was made in these conditions it took about 1 season to come into production. The swine flu started hitting hard and getting attention in Feb 2009, a vaccine candidate was in trials by April and the release testing was finished July. Limited early production went to health care workers, vaccine researchers/staff and their families in Late August. It was more publicly available in late October.

I know this because I was involved in the release testing. We actually had a large layoff on our pandemic team in January because we missed a milestone and the project was defunded. A month later we were scrambling for staff to deal with H1N1. I almost missed my own wedding when I was called in to do emergency release testing because the layoffs left a team without two members trained in a few assays required for safety testing that I had performed a few years prior.

worldnews,ffgcxod,t1_fffrw6u,1579903462.0,"Usually lethality and pathogenicity are inversely related. So the contagious a disease is the less lethal it is.

The exception is usually in diseases new to a species are unpredictable because the host immune response had no historical or genetic immune response advantage. Without a past history with similar pathogens the immune response can be delayed, or non existent. This is why the Spanish flu if 1918 was so devastating.

Its what needs to be changed to stop corporations from having speech, but how would you word that? Do you lose all rights to political free speech the moment you cannot afford to broadcast them from your income? Should political advertising be the sole domain of those who can personally afford it and candidates? Do you lose all rights the moment you have to pool money to take out an ad for and against a politician or position?

In order to change that agreement the company has to get consent from the user or risk huge liability suits. They are constrained by those agreements, if you don't like what they are doing you refuse to sign and export your data."
technology,fdsugxr,t1_fdsfty4,1578708094.0,"In the past these partnerships were testing samples from partnered companies for clinical trials, finding testing groups for diseases and giving them kits with the disclaimer that it will be used for drug development, and then their while survey research program was overly designed to find loci for specific conditions. 

There really is no downside here if they are able to build drugs to treat your genetic disorder. It's not evil for a company to find monetization streams that are not causing harm. The real danger in 23and me IMO us if it goes public and Wall Street runs its board. Running a company like that to maximize profits is going to be harmful. 

I well admit my wife and I own few hundred thousands dollars in 23andme shares and I am a biologist. It's an amazing concept to use genetic data with diagnosed conditions to build a database to mine for designer drugs to genetic defects. The danger is when you violate privacy or we start to get genetic discrimination of any kind."

science,fdnc5vo,t1_fdn6wu8,1578582621.0,"I worked in the vaccine industry making flu vaccines for several years. Each year about this time someone would present an exciting new flu vaccine candidate at x University. They never materialize and only a few have made it to human trials. We all how one works butt in reality it is not well suited for a universal vaccine like other viruses that infect humans. The flu virus is just too plastic and the conserved regions are just not very well suited for immune responses. The virus is also very mutagenic, and has so many hosts that even if you targeted a conserved region you would just be select for mutations in that region and have a new stain type the following year. 

I am sceptical because universal flu is likely a pipedream and something small and academic claim to get funding and investors. It works well for them but I doubt we will see a vaccine that is universal like polio, hepatitis etc. Even those vaccines are starting to select for resistant stains in human populations. 

The best way to see vaccines is like an arms race. As you build one weapon your enemy works on a counter. No matter what you throw at them unless you kill ever last population(in humans, swine, birds etc), they will come back with a better weapon to attack you with at the speed of RNA mutations. The difference between flu and most other vaccinated diseases is how infective flu is and how faulty it's RNA replication is. The virus spends the entire year mutating in human populations as birds migrate from the southern hemisphere to the northern and then back again."

AskReddit,fdk6ur2,t3_ell2h8,1578497420.0,"My wife's mother is one. It's funny our son saw her childhood dentist before he retired and said something along the lines of her being a basket case. In college my wife didn't respond to a text for a day and missed a phone call, she let her phone battery die for a day, and her mother called campus safety and or RA to find her. 


Now my wife barely involves her in her life. When she lived locally she tried to involve herself in everything, judging our every decision. She tried to get my wife to dump me because she didn't like me, tried to get her to divorce me, how to do her job etc. She stopped that somewhat after my wife pointed out that a good Christian shouldn't try and destroy marriages. She tried to interject herself on our shipping for a house. She criticized us trying to get our son help by seeing a play therapist, me being a stay at gone parent to caretaker for him, then getting evaluated and coded special education, CBT, moving to get out of the horrible school district. She tries to helicopter parent my son, harassing him once she had him alone for just a second or two.

Now my wife just involves her as little as possible in her life. We are building a house that will be delivered this summer. We are not going to tell them anything about it until they hear from elsewhere or directly ask. Not going to lie but they are out of the loop. They will probably find out when they visit in May. We see them for about 4 weeks a year now as she moved away from family last year and adopted her husband's brothers family as her own. She moved because her children criticise her too much.

Edit: Our son has autism, ADHD, anxiety, and a few other disorders. When we kindly let her live with us after she sold her home and was house shopping she finally understood our son was atypical. She then went about self diagnosing him, critiquing his official diagnoses, and also took two years to find a home. The last 6 months of that home shopping only her husband stayed at our home, she stayed in an airbnb because my wife lost her temper and yelled at her(when she, a secretary, told my wife, director of high performance computing, how to manage and do her job). That was a day or so before Christmas and she tried to leave that day to go back house shopping. That period was probably the worst year and a half of my adult life. She reorganized everything without asking, treated the house as hers and that she was doing us a favor. Tried to parent our children in direct contradiction to our parenting. She even sat my son down and told him how horrible of a father I was."
