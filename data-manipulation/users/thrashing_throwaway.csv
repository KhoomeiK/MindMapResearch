The hospice/heart attack event happened almost 3 years ago when I was 25. I was semi-housebound because I was chronically ill and disabled but also because I was obligatorily my grandmother’s 24/7 caregiver for almost 2 years. I did it because I loved her and she was my biggest supporter, but honestly I didn’t have a choice. Prior to that, I had suffered a mental breakdown and my mother let me back into the house because they needed a caregiver for my grandmother. Near the end of her organ failure and dementia from strokes and brain bleeds, I was falling apart and needed more time to see my psychologist and have personal time. My mother and I asked my uncle to pay for a caregiver once a week because he never financially or physically contributed to her care, and he told me, “Why? You don’t leave the house anyways.” For the last month of her life, we did have someone there once a week. 

When he gave her that heart attack, I wanted to report him but I’m pretty sure my mother made vague threats against me. But my grandmother was dying and it was devastating and all-consuming to make her comfortable, so I dropped it. 

Plus his partner is rich and has lawyers. I am sure they would make my life hell. 

The house sale was 7 years ago, so that’s over. I tried to confront him about it after the fact. I really don’t want to incur the wrath of his wealthy and well-connected partner by pursuing it legally. 

My grandmother’s local estate lawyer HATES my uncle. I am guessing because he all but gave away her house. 

He’s one of those narcissists where he makes “friends” wherever he goes, most of the community knows him, he’s flamboyant and fun, loves to be generous or the hero...but behind closed doors with family, he’s a gaslighter and can be vicious. We can’t even ask him a simple question and get a straight answer. He just talks in circles. “Haha. Let’s have fun and be silly. Don’t bring me down with your negativity.”

So, even if I tried to out him for who he is and what he did, nobody would believe me. I’d be the troubled niece who he generously tried to help. 

I think it best to continue with my exit strategy and go VLC."

The best you can probably do is limit interactions and “dependence.” Limit time spent with her. Don’t let her think you need her support. Be a [“grey rock”](https://www.e-counseling.com/mental-health/what-is-the-grey-rock-method/)—ie be boring because people like your mother love drama and codependence.

They meant that you’re not a candidate for adopting if you don’t want to adopt. 

“Child free” or “childfree” in this context doesn’t refer to being childless. It refers to a personal philosophy or lifestyle against having children in any capacity, oftentimes militantly. If they don’t like kids or aren’t equipped to raise them, then they shouldn’t be adopting them. 

There is oftentimes overlap between *childfree* and *antinatalism.* The primary difference is that *childfree* is not wanting/liking children for personal reasons. Antinatalism is a macro-level philosophy positing that children should not be conceived and born for moral reasons, which would not preclude us antinatalists from adopting, except that most of us antinatalists also tend to have a childfree mindset maybe because we had fucked up childhoods or life has traumatized us and we know we can’t support a child through the same shit.
