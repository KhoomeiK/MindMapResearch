And I yeah I know these are kinda broad questions and a lot comes into play regarding what the answer would be. Just any input and resources to help is what I'm after, like letting me know about the consultation. Thank you"
legaladvice,ffsgajq,t1_ffsfqx2,1580180996.0,"When I say it's a very large amount I owe, that refund I get from State does not even put a dent in it. For that reason I try to not have to much of state taxes withheld from my checks. I pay every month and have for years. I make my payments responsibly every month, and will for many years to come, it will not be paid off even remotely any time soon. These questions truly are just for the sake of my family and a significant other."

Epilepsy,ffjk0hi,t3_etvyyt,1579999971.0,"I can't upvote this enough because I literally just did the same thing!!!! I can never seem to pull myself  to just sit down, focus on one thing, and just read a book. I have noticed in the past when I do, the toughest is making myself sit and get through like the first 5 pages and I start to settle in and can focus with almost no problems. I just finished Birdbox a couple days ago and have already gotten another book from the library. I'm not a big news years resolution kinda guy but that was my ""goal"" for this year I suppose. Read more. Let my imagination grow more. Learn to focus more. For me each book will be an accomplishment!"

Epilepsy,ff4itu4,t1_ff49avs,1579564646.0,Can also attest to this. I went over 2 years with no seizures and I'm quite the microbrew enthusiast too. I didn't start having problems again until I moved and my neuro switched meds on me. I'm not disapproving anything in this post but it certainly is a case by case scenario. Just like flashing lights doesn't affect everyone with epilepsy.

His life plans/goals do not need to align with what you wanted him to do. As stated above, college isn't for everyone and that is becoming more and more apparent every year. To act like he has no future in music is just ignorant. This decision could lead him to very successful career that he also enjoys. Even if it's not in a band. There are so many careers in music."
