movies,fezjcw3,t1_feze7ph,1579457959.0,I wasn't aware of that market. Thinking about it though makes a lot of sense. Not only the rarity of  them but the fact that non-HD quality analog video just inherently looks scarier than crisp 4K lol. Thanks!

Cassette also sounds good if it is recorded/mastered/whatever correctly and also played on decent equipment. Plus it honestly looks kinda cool to carry a portable cassette player and headphones.

I'm not sure VHS can reasonably display good-looking video in the era of 4K and (by 2031) 8K video. I do not think it is remotely possible. The only way VHS gets a niche following is if people enjoy the absolute shite quality of VHS."

Edit: Actually a better way to explain this is no Chinese citizens can own land. They lease the land from the government for a fee for many years and can build and live in homes on said land. They have to renew the lease periodically. This is a prime communist principal."
