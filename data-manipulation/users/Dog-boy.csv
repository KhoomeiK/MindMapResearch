Monopoly (math and the evils of capitalism), Scattegories (language and organization), Blink (colours, numbers, shapes and quick processing). There are many more with lots of things to be learned. 

Card games are also good. They can teach numbers and math skills. They help with memory and social skills. You can google card games that teach addition, subtraction and multiplication. 

Knitting, crochet and embroidery are good for dexterity, sequencing and breaking gender norms. They can also help with anxiety. Teaching someone how to knit a basic square is great. It's easy and they can be seen together to make blankets for homeless people. A basic scarf is also great as they can be donated or given as gifts. Mittens are also good. Lots of schools appreciate the donation of mittens as kids are always losing their's.

He was drinking an enormous amount and drinking tons of coffee to keep himself awake. He ended up going about 3 days with no sleep. 

He told me on the phone that people were out to get him. He drove to his parents' (about a 10 hr drive) throwing all his wallet contents out if his truck on the way there. When he got there he asked his Mom to wash all his clothes because they were full of radiation. He called me to bring our daughter up to see him and I did because I wasn't aware of how sick he was. In the end I managed to get him to an ER where he was quickly admitted when he started telling them about his grandmother Eva Braun. He spent about a week in a psych hospital. By the time he was released he was much better though still somewhat out of it. Told our kids he thought they had a half brother who was coming to live with him. Within another week all the delusions stopped. 

However during that time I did find out he had had a previous psychotic break when he was  in the army in his early 20s. Same reason, alcohol, coffee, no sleep. Doctors told him after the second one that if he went back to drinking he was at high risk of another one which may lead to full blown schizophrenia. He gave up drinking and has never gone back. He has never had another psychotic break."

AskReddit,fe92z3k,t1_fe8xqys,1578933662.0,"First I dislike the question assuming all conservatives are climate change deniers. That said, I think denying it isnt just being a sceptic. At this point (and for more than 30 years) the science is clear. The planet is heating at a rate that is intolerable for civilizations as we now know them and it is being hugely impacted by people. So you are no longer sceptics you are deniers. As deniers who are actively working against steps to try and slow things down you are working to destroy things. 

An analogy would be, a flaming train is heading toward a town. At first some people say hey I think that train is on fire. We better stop it. Others say i don't see any fire and all our supplies are on it. We can't stop it. We need those supplies. As the train gets closer more people recognize it is burning and people start making plans to go throw the switch to send the train in another direction. The group who really wants the goods forms a barricade stopping the switch throwers. As it passes the place where the tracks split and it is closer some of the deniers realize their mistake and join those who are fighting to minimize the danger to the community. They come up with a variety of plans, throw stuff on the track and derail the train, have the fire department hose down the train as it passes, evacuate the homes closest to the tracks. At each step the deniers put up a fight and minimize the effectiveness of the plan. They keep yelling, ""We need those goods"". Eventually the burning train hits the town and many people die, houses are destroyed, the infrastructure is damaged and the goods on the train are largely lost to the fire. The sceptics weren't just sceptics. They could have allowed the train to be diverted. If it wasn't really on fire the goods could have been retrieved, though with some inconvenience and additional cost. They could have let any of the other steps be taken and it would have been the lesser harm of the two scenarios. The sceptics became murderers when they refused to accept that the other point might be true and steps should be taken to mitigate the potential damage."

I also think about if I need to reteach it and how.

In other subjects it is similar with more humour. Decide if I want to mark randomly or pick out the kids I think likeliest to have it correct and do them first. Never start with the struggling ones because it's too depressing. Still always thinking about how I can help a kid better understand whatever the material is.
