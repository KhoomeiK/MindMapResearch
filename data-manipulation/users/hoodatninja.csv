It also has to do with the fact that he was so exceptionally young, which is an achievement, but also means it all cane pretty quickly, You would be hard-pressed to describe his life as a “working class struggle.” 

Again, this does not mean he is lazy, didn’t work hard, is out of touch, etc. There’s a whole gradient between what you are describing and what I said in my first comment.

f/8 refers to the aperture or “stop.” You open and close this little circular blade in the lens called an aperture. It increases/decreases the light coming (I.e. brightness) and also impacts focus. 

mm is the lens millimeter. Called “focal length.” This is how wide or tight the lens is. A 40-50mm lens is somewhat “what our eyes see.” On your camera, a 35mm is closer. That’s a result of sensor crop but you’ll learn that later. 35mm and under is usually considered “wide” and over 50mm is considered “tight.”

A GoPro, for reference, is like...12mm. Very wide, very “fisheye” look.

You should bookmark [No Film School](https://nofilmschool.com/), [Film Riot](https://m.youtube.com/user/filmriot), and any sites/tutorials you like. There are SO many good resources out there for free. /r/videography and /r/filmmaking, as well as /r/bmpcc are good resources. Just read, read, read and watch, watch, watch. It won’t all click at first, but you’ll piece it together. 

Most importantly: Just shoot. Learn the camera by doing. Go film, see that the footage has “x” problem, and google “why does my footage have ‘x’ problem.” Rinse and repeat. You will shoot a lot of garbage and that’s ok. It’ll get better and you’ll also get some dope content to fuel you as you learn.

I also recommend getting external hard drives. Start with 2x western digital 2TB drives. Never ever store your videos on your computer. You’ll eat up all your space in a matter of weeks and it’s pointless wear and tear on your drive. Western digital easy store 8TB’s also go on sale a crap ton and are great bulk solutions. Those go for like $150-$160, $120-$140 on sale. Always keep at minimum 2 copies of all footage you actually want to keep.
