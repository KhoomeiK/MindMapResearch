You never heard a bad word about him in Columbus. Not from fans. Not from coaches. Especially not from teammates. Even when it looked like we might play him, it was not uncommon to hear “If we have to lose, at least I hope it’s to Joe.”

Just bad luck for him here. But Burreaux’s the kind of guy who’s always seemed to make his own luck. You guys were fortunate enough to be the benefactors.

Showerthoughts,fdf4zro,t1_fdelcw9,1578353438.0,Yep. I agree. I think we’re talking about very similar things. Being a part of something bigger than yourself is important. But it requires a delicate balance of not wholly losing yourself to it.
Showerthoughts,fdeglhs,t1_fddxa0i,1578338578.0,"I get what your saying. My point primarily is one of caution that if you spend too much focus pleasing others for sake of their approval, you can lose what is important to you. In certain circles racism is a norm. If it doesn’t seem right to you, then succumbing to that contradicts your internal compass and limits yourself to external pressures. 

I don’t think that people who “don’t seek the approval of others” are by definition subjects of social disorders. I think “not caring about the well being” of others does. A lack of empathy can lead to selfish, narcissist and destructive behavior. I’m not advocating that."
Showerthoughts,fdefvbn,t1_fdds2s1,1578338129.0,"Basically what other folks have responded with.  Beliefs are things you find to be true regardless of religion. It’s your view of the world. “This is how things are.”

Values are things you feel are important. One of my values is that beliefs should be tested because an untrue belief can cause people to act in unhealthy ways. “White people are bad!” Are there examples where that is not the case? Why / why not?"
Showerthoughts,fddmkh2,t1_fddef6o,1578317847.0,"I think of it as three different aspects. 

1) Who do I believe I am? 2) Who do I want to be? 3) How do I think others want me to be?

1) Am I acting in accordance with my beliefs? 2) Am I acting in accordance with my values? 3) Am I seeking the approval of others?

1) Being realistic and humble to your current actions and habits. 2) Being aspirational to improvement. 3) Limiting potential due to the views of others. 

1&2 are hard and a continuous process. 3 is just a self-imposes roadblock."

CFB,fcwxo7r,t1_fcwrd08,1578042045.0,"Totally agree. And if you look at a Clemson or OSU with Venables and Johnson - they are consistently their core strengths. We have a reputation for awesome D-Lines... especially ends. Clemson is known for their defense. By the way, Hartline is becoming that with WRs (please don’t leave). I think Day already has that reputation with QBs. 

Saban is able to pull recruits because of who he and the program are. I think Dabo has done the same but had to earn it the hard way. 

I think Day can get there with consistent results.  But the Clark Phillips’ and Cameron Martinezes are going to need Day to prove it. I think those two would already be signed under Urban. 

Getting Coombs would bring in Martinez I bet. And have Phillips kicking himself. 

Also - Urban always got a few surprise commits on signing day. Not sure Day has that much dog in him. I don’t think we’d be having the RB recruiting issues either under Meyer. The fact we’re behind in our recruiting there given our history is crazy to me.

CFB,fcw7qgd,t1_fcvc4wu,1578019071.0,"Here’s the potential chink I see in Day’s armor. Urban handled the inevitable coaching carousel very well. He had the experience, clout, connections and personality to keep the program together as high profile assistants came and went (I’m not going to go into the failings here: see Zach Smith). 

He got great coaches who were willing to work under a legend to learn and advance their careers. He got recruits to stay during transitions because he was the head guy and had the track record to keep recruits confident in the program’s direction. 

Day has done an exceptional job with Hafley, Mattison and Washington. But keeping the coaching pipeline going as well as the recruiting one could be tough. 

I’m hoping the Kerry Coombs rumors are true. But long-term he’s going to have to keep refilling the coaching cupboard and assure recruits it’s going to be okay as assistants who built relationships with them leave. 

I’m not saying Day can’t get there. I’m actually optimistic and hopeful that he will.  But it’s something that’s earned over a career. I think he needs to manage that short-term while he builds his reputation."
