piercing,ff9w7ng,t3_esbwqk,1579722856.0,How long did it take for the swelling in your rook to fully subside and for you ear to look normal again? I got my rook two weeks ago and although it’s no longer painful and the swelling has gone down substantially it’s still swollen and the bar is still not visible.
