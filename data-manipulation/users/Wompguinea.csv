NoStupidQuestions,fefnhpa,t1_fefmr97,1579060184.0,"I think we're coming at this from 2 different directions.

The fact that Greece and Rome were large single countries was kinda my point, as was the fact that they were largely detached from their neighbouring countries (as were all EU countries) for the majority of their existence.

My point was that, while they all play nice now that the EU exists, extensive cooperation was never part of their infrastructures and they managed quite nicely as self contained countries.

Whereas the US has only existed for a fraction of the time that Europe has, and has spent the bulk of that time as a highly integrated collection of states instead of self sufficient countries. They never had to be entirely self sufficient because cooperation was always part of the deal.

So what I was curious to know is whether or not the current states exist in a way where they could close borders and become self sufficient (as much as any country is these days, not like Feudal Japan).

The most important things to remember when it comes to Morrowind are: 

-You're not the Nerevarine until you 'earn' it so the game won't treat you special like you're some kinda Dragonborn or something.

-Choose at least one weapon skill as a major skill, then actually use that weapon. Combat is near impossible for new players if you're unskilled.

There are also small 7 towns (Riverwood probably being the biggest).

In the same map size, Morrowind has 4 major cities (Balmora, Ald'ruhn, Sadrith Mora and Vivec) Vivec is massive, it's actually made of 10 city sized towers, each about the playable space of Whiterun but crowded and busy... like a city should be. So it's closer to 14 city sized locations.

There are also 18 towns all between the size of Riverwood and Falkreath.

There's also 4 functional Imperial forts, with Services and Quests and 4 major Ashlander Camps. These 8 locations are probably about the size of Dragon Bridge in content.

Both games squeeze a ton of caves/ruins into their maps but I have no trouble believing that there are more in Morrowind.


Between Riverwood and Whiterun (following  the main road, with minor detours) you can pass by the Honningbrew Meadery and Pelagia Farm. If you go out of your way you can also hit up White River Watch or Bleak Falls Barrow (4 total).

Between Seyda Neen and Balmora (similar distance) you've got Addamasartus, Andrano Ancestral Tomb, Pelagiad, Ulummusa, Adanumuran, Moonmoth Legion Fort and Tharys Ancestral Tomb for a total of 7. Those are all visible from the road too, no detours needed (unlike half of the Skyrim locations above).

Morrowind is much, much, much denser in content than any of the open world RPGs that came after. It only feels small because the geography doesn't lend itself to sprawling views, so you can't see as much stuff at once."
