shiba,ffhwz59,t3_etl0tm,1579957595.0,"Well, maybe you could thing of something to get him to romp around in your yard. Does he chase balls? Could you teach him to fetch? 15 ti 20 mins of that a day would do it. Then on weekends wear him out with long walks. Sounds like he just has a lot of energy and no outlet for it."
aww,ffh7utw,t1_ffh638v,1579925594.0,You beat me to it!!! LOL.

shiba,ffh5cx5,t3_etl0tm,1579923559.0,"Okay...to all I would suggest exercise, exercise, exercise. Outdoor walks with a small backpack. He's young so don't put too much weight in it, but perhaps a pound of beans on each side. Just get 'em at the grocery store.
If you bike, they sell special attachments so he can trot next to you.
They can be energetic (very) when young...but mine have always calmed down around 18 months.if you wear him out with exercise each day, you all will be a lot happier."

shiba,ffe64v0,t3_et3el7,1579837713.0,"Try CBD treats and perhaps a grinder? I would try holding and cuddling him and just touching the toe with the clipper or grinder. Just keep touching them with it, and randomly give treats. When he gets used to it touching his feet, you can turn it on near the toes...go slow with this...lots of treats and praise. My 12 year old is still horrible. I have to muzzle him. Once the muzzle goes on...he quiets down."

shiba,ffcdenh,t1_ffcbtk2,1579797048.0,"Of course! You know, dogs just do disgusting things sometimes. Lol
The For-bid works and you'll only have to di it for a week or so. Then you can stop and only use it again if he starts to do it again."

shiba,feyga7n,t3_eqws2k,1579445115.0,"Part of being a pup! Give her plenty of chewable toys, crate her when you leave, and a firm ""no"" when she starts to chew something she shouldn't and quickly give her an approved chewie.
And did I mention patience? She won't get adult teeth until she's 6 mos old."

shiba,feyf2l7,t1_feydwhm,1579444634.0,"I believe what we used was Accent, which is not a seasoning and tenderizer, but just a tenderizer. Anyway, the other powder is also available online. It is called For-bid."

shiba,fey91ea,t3_eqshi7,1579442322.0,"You can purchase a product that is a powder that you sprinkle on their food that makes the poop very distasteful to them. I also believe you can sprinkle a bit of powdered meat tenderizer on their food, and it will do the same thing. You can check this online. Poor baby...go a bit easier on him. He's a baby....hug him for me."
