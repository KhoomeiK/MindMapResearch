But this argument doesn’t take into account Trump’s working with Russia for dirt on Hillary or the 43% of Americans who didn’t vote. Not to mention the dividing ads put up by Russian bots to encourage people to not vote.

agedlikemilk,fcr8roq,t1_fcpt0st,1577898426.0,"The first part is fair- but headsets aren’t a huge expense anymore. To buy a nice monitor, with a high refresh rate and low response time will cost you around $350. A rift s is $400 new, and there are WMR headsets for $150 new. If I can buy one, as a high schooler whose funds are from mowing lawns and birthday cash, then I feel like it’s not impossible for a good amount of people.

4 or 5 “good”  games is also fair, but only because there are a handful of well known games. Just like there are tons on indie pancake games, there are tons of great indie VR games. If HL:A is a success also, I’d bet we see an explosion of triple A games.
