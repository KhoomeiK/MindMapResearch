Fallout,ffovegv,t3_eu6qsa,1580082280.0,Better yet I had a few bugs where Ferals demanded a ransom. Like yeah these brainless monsters kidnapped settlers and  demanded a ransom. I know it was ferals cuz they sent me to rescue them in College Square and there wasnt a raider to be found.

fo76,ffotzhb,t1_ffmptya,1580081806.0,"In New Vegas they were really good. I used the Incinerator in my Pyromaniac playthroughs that you get from Primm, switched to the Heavy Incinerator and evemtuslly got the unique one (i wanna say it was Cleansing Flame) and also used Gehenna the legendary Shishkebab.

In 3, I used the Heavy Incinerator, Flamer and Shishkebab in my Pyro build. Pretty amazing weapons thats for sure. It wasnt until 4 that quality dropped. Why is the flamer and shishkebab so weak nowadays."

fo76,ffgah80,t1_ffgacos,1579901960.0,Its not? Isnt each shot counted as 5 shots vs just 1? So furious would make it op quicker yes?
fo76,ffgadti,t1_fffy8fw,1579901903.0,I usually jet pack the arms because why not lol. Surprised this bug hasnt been fixed yet. Makes me wonder if its intentional.

fo76,ffg971j,t1_ffg8yj5,1579901170.0,I would imagine a furious shotgun is good as each shot is pretty much 5 rounds so itll probably fill up faster per shot and take out most.
fo76,ffg8bwz,t1_ffg814m,1579900641.0,"Im assuning somewhere in the 200s and since its a Furious Shotgun i would assume 5 hits each add up quickly vs just 1 hit each and explosive to boot meaning with demo expert itll reach 300+ however much it hits. Shotguns use 5 bullets each, so each hit I would imagine counts towards the Furious Effect."

fo76,ffehjks,t3_eszu4h,1579848262.0,Why is Ammosmith in Agility? It feels like an intelligence perk since its about consolidating ammo using less resources. What does that have to do with being agile? Same with White Knight. Its the Weapon Artisan of armors yet its in Agility.
