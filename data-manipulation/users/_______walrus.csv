Weird names include: Lugnab (pronounced Luna. Spelling confirmed by parents). Serendipity. Stevie Rae (first name, girl) and her twin sister Billiae Rae. Love. Haynnayah (“Hannah “). Jayckoub (Jacob). Gay-daeyion (Gaedon, rhymes with Braydon). And Richayrd, a four year old girl.

A method I favored was putting a little but loud Bluetooth speaker next to our shared vent. When she wouldn’t shut the fuck up, I would blast music. Usually something chill on repeat for hours on end. My favorite and most popular pick was Margaritaville. 

If your windows are open, and good loud “SHHHHHHHH!!!!!!” sometimes does it. My neighbors did this when my flatmates abroad were super loud. We never knew where it came from since it echoed. 

Other recommendations include noise cancelling headphones, learning how to play a drum kit, ear plugs, a white noise machine/box fan/radio/etc to be background noise and drown them out, anonymously order pizza to their house for weeks, get a boom box, or...move when you can. 

Also, record them sometime to show your father how loud they are. Nobody thought my former neighbor actually shrieked like a fucking banshee until I got a video of it."
