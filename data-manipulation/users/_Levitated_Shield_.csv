But in all serious, they used Sweet Victory and Stephen Hillenburg as viewer bait at the halftime show when we all were expecting Sweet Victory to be played. Instead, we got three seconds. Three seconds."
ComedyCemetery,ffzdct8,t1_ffzczfp,1580373385.0,"No, because the date I was born is a specific moment. A 6969th day of a century can happen every day because we’re not referring to a specific century generally speaking. 100 years from my birthdate will be my 100th birthday, but 100 years after that day will not be my birthday if that makes sense. 100 years from yesterday was a century. 100 years from now is a century. 100 years from tomorrow will be a century.

Edit: Interesting. Why did you edit your comment from 'birthday' to 'New Years'? If you simply said New Years, I would've agreed with you to some degree, but what you've done to your comment comes off as trying to make yourself right and myself wrong in this scenario hence why you're being upvoted and I'm being downvoted."
