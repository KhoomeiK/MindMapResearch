philadelphia,fgky6ol,t1_fgkm6gn,1580876497.0,That's insane. It was very real. And the best Sizzli. The waffle one doesnt even come close. Like soggy cardboard.
philadelphia,fgjr8gq,t1_fgjhmxk,1580849815.0,"Seriously, they ruined Sizzlis about 10 years ago when they got rid of the Pancake sizzli and stopped using the foil wrappers. Can barely even get one down now. So disappointing"

GalaxyNote8,fg6nsok,t1_fg6nj63,1580572726.0,Nothing. This guy is blowing smoke. It will still be a perfectly fine phone for a normal user for a couple years.
hardware,fg51t7j,t1_fg374gh,1580516199.0,"My 2003 Sony HD Trinitron has not an HDMI port, but a DVI port with RCA audio! It makes hooking up anything modern a pain in the ass. You can use a DVI to HDMI cable but then you dont get audio unless the device has an analog output to tap into."
GalaxyS8,fg2kzdp,t1_fg27s21,1580447093.0,"I agree, in an ideal world they should get more updates but tough shit. Samsung is  in the business of making money, like all other companies. It must not be worth their investment to keep developing on (relatively) old platforms. I don't agree with it but it's just the way it is."
galaxys10,fg20ifl,t1_fg1twza,1580436014.0,I have the S10+ and the larger screen size makes it painfully obvious. It looks blurry and lifeless in 1080p.
IdiotsInCars,fg1i953,t1_fg1hfk9,1580427587.0,No way 40 vs 50 would have made any difference here.
GalaxyS8,fg1homz,t1_ffzmelg,1580427296.0,"Exactly. Android version numbers don't change the way it looks and feels, especially on Samsung. I guarantee you 99% of users would not be able to tell between Android 9 and 10."
galaxys10,fg1f710,t1_fg0tij6,1580426017.0,Yup. So they need to stop shipping these phones preset to 1080p. These screens are beautiful and limiting them by default is just a disgrace
