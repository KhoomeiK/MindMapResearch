childfree,feafi88,t1_feadlfx,1578948080.0,"For us, a lot of our work is as needed such as responding to questions via emails that come in. Some of it is just planning upcoming programs and events. I typically get my ""work"" done in 3-4 hours each day, unless I have a special program or meeting. So I spend a fair amount of time planning new stuff, waiting on questions, or just hanging out waiting on 5:00. In that sense I can say the same amount of work could easily be done from home as its not one of those ""how much can you get done today"" type of jobs. Also, what time we do our tasks for the day doesn't really matter, as long as we do them. 

We do spend about 75% of our days with programs or meetings that often run over the 8 hour workday. So the 25% of days we're not are very laid back and just making sure our tasks are completed. We're very fortunate in our flexibility with this job, but sometimes I feel the flexibility falls more on those with children and the rest of us have to keep the office open."

dogs,fe912ll,t3_eo5ud3,1578933041.0,"I have this problem as well, however I have a bit of a special scenario. 

We have a spot of land on a creek that's pretty secluded. I love to take my dogs there as they plenty of room to run and explore, with supervision, without worrying about other dogs being around. They also LOVE to swim, so its perfect on a summer day to relax with a picnic and fetching sticks out of the creek. Sometimes we'll have a get together and friends will bring their dogs to play as well. 

Well, one time a family friend brought a dog without warning. Ok, no big deal I thought to myself, as long as she's friendly. She was not. This little dog was not socialized, and upon their arrival the family opened the truck door and just let the dog out. No warning for my pups or myself. Had I known I would have gotten the leashes or at least put my dogs in a sit/stay to properly meet the new dog. Nope, this dog doesn't even have a collar, much less a leash or manners. A small fight breaks out as I'm trying to wrangle my two pups away from this crazed mutt. Luckily, no damage or broken skin for any dogs. 

Crazed mutt then attacks another dog who was just happily carrying a stick around. At this point I thought surely they would take the dog home or ask to borrow a leash or something. Nope, they said ""oh they're just dogs, they'll work it out and be fine in a little bit."" Needless to say words were exchanged and the crazy pup ended up being taken home."
Equestrian,fe8vp80,t1_fe8uexr,1578931542.0,"Its true. On this sub especially I feel like people love to point out rider's flaws and also any type of equipment/environmental problems. Everyone makes mistakes. Not everyone can afford to have super high quality paddocks or arenas or saddles or anything. Just because it isn't ""perfect"" doesn't mean its dangerous or should be criticized. While I'm not ignoring the fact sometimes it can be dangerous, its not always. 

I've seen people absolutely destroy a little girl who had her saddle pad on backwards. This little girl was not able to take formal lessons and her parents were mostly clueless. A helpful comment that its on backwards is sufficient. No need to bring her to tears. We should be welcoming new people into our love for horses, not making them feel stupid and unwanted."

My hair always has these frizzies. Always. I’ve tried bowl method, hot water, cold water, different shampoos, protein, different conditioners/leave ins.  It looks like this but with more curl after applying the leave in and curl activator"
