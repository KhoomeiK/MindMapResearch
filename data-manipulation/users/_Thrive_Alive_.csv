My fear is not of death or oblivion. My fear is not knowing if my consciousness will be present in the oblivion. I can’t imagine the level of torturous it would be to be a conscious mind in a world of total nothingness and being  literally incapable of doing anything besides listening to my own thoughts. 

If I knew oblivion meant total nothingness where I wouldn’t in any way have a temporal form I would be so down for death."
TrollCoping,ff4iwgo,t1_ff4hs03,1579564697.0,"Well thank you so much. 

I’ve had shitty mental health my whole life, and I figured my family dynamic was exacerbating it. So I bounced, got a job, and started college. 

Things were looking up, and then I got hit with a major depressive episode. I skipped my final exams, tried to kill myself, and now my GPA is 0.77. There’s a bad grade point average and then there’s not even having a single grade point. 

My job sucks but I need money to pay for the classes I failed and the new ones I’m about to barely pass. 

I can’t vent to anyone in my family because they’ll just say that I should quit school,come back to the community, and be a housewife.

Which I don’t want...but some part of me still does. At least before I destroyed everything I knew exactly what my hardships were going to be, now I barely sleep and cry a lot because I’m scared my family was right and the world is a terrible place."

There’s nothing wrong with wearing whatever you want, and if you are a man then your clothes are automatically men’s clothes regardless of whether they are a skirt,dress, or anything not traditionally masculine. 

There is nothing wrong with you, even if you feel unsafe wearing what you want around your family so you hide it. Don’t be ashamed because the problem is with judgmental people not with you."

AskReddit,fevhn5a,t3_eql1ss,1579397579.0,"Well seriously as someone whose parents escaped a cult they were born into;

The easiest way to start a cult is to use ideas from old world established religions. 

Establish yourself as a person of the people by combining charisma,practical benefits of becoming a member of your “totally open group”(community,assistance,experiences,and supportive family type relationships) and a promise of being able to provide people with spiritual knowledge they can’t attain from others....

Target people who are outliers from society: the disabled, mentally ill, rebellious teens, people who are newly moved out of their parents house and craving support, newly sober people, and the poor. Give them a life or purpose that they will perceive as being better than what they were doing before. Once they are effectively transformed, have them go out into the world and reach out to former friends and family with the story of their awesome transformation, and then convince regular people that your group can do the same for them. 

Once you have firmly indoctrinated a large amount of people, introduce the concept of community work for “collective enrichment”, normalize member donations to fund group interests. 

Encourage all the people in your group to buy property in the same area, room with people from the group, or become the majority of renters in an apartment complex(bonus conversion of neighbours who will want to conform to the newly introduced social norms). 

The normal members who don’t come from fucked up backgrounds( the second round of recruits) are ideal candidates for local positions of power/influence, ideally they should already have either an established career as a teacher,lawyer,police officer,politician,lobbyist, or be in training. 

They will already have a fair amount of influence, and with the money of the collective behind them they will be able to compound that influence into power. Which is by proxy your power. 

At this point you will want to start a slow and subtle push toward insularity, so pick a group or idea that you can transform into the big bad, and have the devotees of this group send out whispers of it into the rest of the group and(to a lesser degree)their workplaces(snag a few more powerful people before you set things in stone). 

Once the town where your group lives is thoroughly indoctrinated or at least comes to accept your groups presence and authority, slam down the metaphorical barriers and tell your group that while they are amazing and the truth is radically freeing, there is only so much of this awesomeness to go around, have them on guard against not only the “big bad” but also “outsiders who would steal their place” 

Lastly in order to maintain a cult for decades or more, your group needs to look innocuous to outsiders, so don’t be doing any stupid shit like hellfire preaching, or creating gendered uniform. If your going to create a dress code, make sure to update every so often in order to stay a least comparably similar to modern fashion. 

Restriction of freedoms should not be forced through physical actions, it should be implicit through the reinforcement of social codes and shaming. 

Basically if you use people’s inclination toward the hive mind against them, it’s a fairly streamlined process from “religious teacher/spiritual guide” to cult leader.

Although I really don’t recommend you actually do this because it’s not nice..."
AskReddit,fevc8fi,t3_eqj6hg,1579395701.0,"People who flaunt their supposed intellect with an attitude of superiority. 

I don’t really have a lot of friends so I’ve lately been trying to connect more with my peers, I try to give everyone a chance and hope that I’ll adjust to their personality in time.

However every single time I’ve said “oh well I’ll give them a chance” about someone who at first seemed arrogant about their intelligence, they’ve turned out to be super poorly adjusted people who have a bunch of other personality problems. 

They were all quite smart, and I don’t think it’s wrong to acknowledge your own abilities. I’ve just found that smart people who can say without an ego “I am pretty sure I know a lot of things, but I know that there is someone who knows more than me”, are much nicer people than the intelligence gatekeepers."
