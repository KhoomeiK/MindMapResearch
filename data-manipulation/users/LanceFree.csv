I’m actually surprised it came back for more seasons.  If I want to give it another shot- where to start? Season 2 intro? End of Season 1? Is there a certain episode that stands out?"

MadeMeSmile,ffxzusj,t1_ffxqvic,1580335721.0,"This reminds me of when I was in Texas and a group of us agreed to help a guy move from his apartment.  Being Texas and all, there were 5 pick-up trucks and a Suburban.  As we were almost done loading, my friend Jim shows up in his Nissan truck.  He goes in the house and comes back out with some jackets on hangers and a toilet plunger.  Someone comments how everyone else has their trucks loaded with furniture and big things and Jim’s little truck can only handle lightweight stuff.  It fell oddly quiet and then two guys went to their truck and pulled-out a filing cabinet which they loaded into Jim’s Nissan.  Someone yelled out “Yay!”, most of us started clapping or laughing.

I skipped the wine and pocketed a bottle of ginger ale. I remember looking around at all the people and thinking, “guess I will be standing.”  There was a nice cheese and cold cuts and appetizer table and it looked good.  The plates had a thumb hole- never saw anything like it before but I put my thumb through the hole and loaded-up my plate.  It was a bad design because my thumb didn’t look very appetizing sticking into my food. I decided this style of plate would never catch on.  I found my boss and small group of strangers standing near a fireplace and walked over.  One woman had a plate and dangling from her thumb hole was a wineglass.  Oh! Just as I realized my blunder, my boss points it out for everyone who all thought it was really funny.  I saw some of those people later and they’d wave or say hello and I wonder how many shared the story about the dumb guy at the cocktail party last night."
