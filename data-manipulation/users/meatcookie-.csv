SubredditDrama,ff3m0r7,t3_erctjg,1579543914.0,"I used to be a pretty decent streamer for that game. I played from beta to the beginning of D2 and the one thing I just couldn’t stick around for was the community. They have some of the  coolest people in the world, and some of the most down to earth people. But all they do is complain about Bungie. They spend so much time whining and crying about how “little” they care it became toxic and unplayable. I still don’t know how people play that game. The higher ups in the community (streamers, well rounded skilled players) are just super toxic and it rubs off on the rest of the community."

FortniteCompetitive,fdphpy9,t3_emfsyh,1578628934.0,"Any other pro gaming community is jealous about how much money epic gives to its competitors and its really sad to see how much the fortnite community complains. 

You’ll never have to travel to a LAN
Pay money to travel/house/compete 
You get to enter as many as you want 

I just think it’s really sad seeing the community complain. As much as I enjoy watching and playing (casually play I’m not good enough/don’t wanna pit the time into the game since I’m a new player) 

 But I’ve been following eSports for over a decade and the growth is NUTS. No one was this ungrateful back in the day. I know I sound like a fuckin boomer but let’s be real. If I told you you had to pay $500 to fly to an event,  $200 to stay at a hotel for 3 days with 3-4 other dudes,  pay $200+ for a team pass just to get your name out there ... no one would be interested anymore. Take what you can and try to build a brand for yourself. Gaming can be a career but you need to find a backup. I wish I did. :(
