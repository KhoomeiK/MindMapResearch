GetMotivated,fcjpl6n,t1_fcjm8a0,1577698217.0,"I am an introvert with few friend which might explain more why this works for me, especially considering if I completely fell out with someone, including people who will take their side , I’ll knock out 1/5 of all people I talk to. I prefer to lose contact with people and if it’s a bad relationship they rarely go out their way to contact me (this is more personal, I know it’s not like this for others at all!) I hate drama, worry about what is said about me behind my back and once drama is set off, you can’t control who gets involved."
relationship_advice,fcj0wf0,t1_fcika4x,1577674519.0,"I wish I knew you in real life and could help you. whatever happens, know you DONT DESERVE IT and the worse your mother is, the more you deserve kindness and love. Please try and get out, get therapy when you can and focus on building healthy relationships that will give you the love you deserve and need. Never settle or be friends with anyone anything like your mother, in any relationships."
relationship_advice,fcj0c5m,t1_fcise0i,1577674125.0,"Yes, it seems so odd and horrible a mother so loving to one child can turn on another (in my head I just can’t understand the thought process behind it). Only OP knows how out of character this is for her."
GetMotivated,fcizl62,t3_ehdo84,1577673614.0,"I only have one burnt bridge and the stress and anxiety it caused along with  the divide between me and the people on the other persons side of the bridge doesn’t make it worth it. Then again, i haven’t made relationships with truly evil people where burning bridges protects you. In any non-abusive relationships,mho is keep things civil and don’t get others involved."
science,fcigu2r,t3_ehb2fq,1577662322.0,"See, we’ve all been saying toxic masculinity is bad."
AskWomen,fcig3iy,t1_fci0s9p,1577662005.0,"Do you think it was the perming or tinting them that caused damage? You can get at home eyelash tints and for eyebrows lots of people buy just for men dye or a home dye kit (if you’ve got the trust in your skills to try that yourself  that is). This would be less expensive, but again it doesn’t really answer your question of going completely natural. I bet you’re prettier than you give yourself credit, it’s just strange seeing yourself bare faced when you’re not used to it."
AskWomen,fci0ae2,t3_eh8tuc,1577656219.0,"Tinting your eyebrows, eyelashes can be a way to wake up and like the way you look before putting any makeup on. It’s sort of cheating no makeup but it’s not unnatural to have darker eyebrows/eyelashes if this would make you feel better."
socialskills,fchzcvg,t1_fchuzzg,1577655919.0,"i hope they understood, I’ve got mates who r blunt and it’s just who they are you can’t get offended because it’s not cruel"
socialskills,fchoqvq,t1_fcgnzup,1577652534.0,"Maybe it’s worth saying to them you don’t mean to make rude comments, because some people just are more blunt with their language and aren’t necessarily mean"
PlasticSurgery,fchoe5b,t1_fcho9h5,1577652402.0,I actually love this.
GetMotivated,fchaao3,t1_fcha0xu,1577648707.0,"I do understand there are people suffering irreparable lives but I believe whether it’s a job, partner, child, pet e.t.c there’s something that will improve your life and give you just a bit of reason"
GetMotivated,fcha0xu,t1_fch9ash,1577648615.0,I think even if it doesn’t happen almost everyone has the potential for it to happen
PlasticSurgery,fch0ln8,t1_fcgzazl,1577646037.0,"Oh and also,  I bet you looked better than you thought because people are harsher on themselves than others your dad might not have  found those features on you anywhere near as “ugly” as he did on himself, but youd obviously know if I’m right in saying that or not."
PlasticSurgery,fch05nk,t1_fcgzazl,1577645879.0,"No matter how great parents are, they all make mistakes and it’s sad how much of an impact their words, particularly your dads, made and how little understanding they had when you had surgery. Then again it’s hard to weigh up everything you say and the effect on your children, so I’m glad I’m aware of this and can be that little bit better when I have kids."
StudentNurse,fcgxpue,t3_eh2g8y,1577645061.0,"what you went through sounds like a horror story and it’s amazing something good came out of it. I think this is also a great example of why you shouldn’t put off going the doctors, especially if you live alone!"
PlasticSurgery,fcgwm48,t3_eh97qf,1577644752.0,Wow! it’s natural but it completely changes the way your face looks altogether. I hope the surgery goes well :)
PlasticSurgery,fcgppyx,t1_fcglliz,1577642796.0,"No I do agree with you to an extent and this is what worries me. I’d feel guilty to see a daughter with my nose cry about it like I have (from cruel comments) whilst I stand there with a lovely surgically altered one. Then again, I guess with good parenting a child can be more resilient, positive and confident than I am."
PlasticSurgery,fcgow2q,t1_fcgg7kj,1577642464.0,"I do believe parents should talk kindly about themselves and never criticising their appearance in front of children, especially moms in front of daughters."
JUSTNOMIL,fcg7kyy,t1_fcg6tzy,1577637227.0,"Oh wow, do you ever turn around to your SO and say “I told you so” when she’s acting like a psychopath."

GetMotivated,fcg5zm5,t3_eh6gex,1577636808.0,I think it’s so important to spread stories like this so people know “it gets better” isn’t just a cliche lie. I hope you continue on this happy path and if you ever face any difficulties you can overcome them.
PlasticSurgery,fcg5csn,t1_fcg4mz0,1577636623.0,I guess one benefit now you’re planning on surgery  is you know what the “after” will look like by looking at them.
JUSTNOMIL,fcg4u24,t3_eh23zl,1577636473.0,"Honestly, I think it’s better she’s so villainous it’s comical, therefore everyone can easily side against her. She could be two faced and put on a sweet old lady act with some people whilst making others’ lives a misery with snide subtle remarks and manipulation,  so they can’t say anything about it without looking like they’re harassing the dear old mother."
Parenting,fcg34e6,t3_eh4m5o,1577636050.0,Is it the actual brushing or the taste? If it’s the taste you can get non foaming tasteless toothpaste and there’s also a few apps to help kids brush teeth which play songs... although she might be too young for this. Also if she only has baby teeth a minute could be long enough? I agree with you that you’re not being too harsh! If she doesn’t like teeth brushing she won’t like cavities or having teeth removed.
FinalSpace,fcg1pp5,t3_eh6azy,1577635696.0,"Awww this is good, you should add some colour :)"
SkincareAddiction,fcaia5h,t1_fc9v9w2,1577569712.0,Are there any good ones that don’t clog pores?
JUSTNOMIL,fc8v8qj,t3_egmd3w,1577542558.0,"Labors are medical procedures, people shit, piss, sweat, cry, scream and swear. it’s beyond understandable why you wouldn’t want someone you’re not even close with there. The most important part is the baby and it isn’t like you’re not letting her see it."
AskWomen,fc737fv,t1_fc6e659,1577496325.0,"That last sentence hit me. people say being pretty doesn’t fix your problems and looking a certain way doesn’t matter, and to an extent I agree but actually it does make some difference and I believe it makes people who aren’t closest to you treat you better."
PlasticSurgery,fc3tlgq,t3_efzukt,1577398295.0,You’re eyes look so beautiful! Almost feline like if that isn’t odd to say (eyeliner is also on fleek)
PlasticSurgery,fc2zwc7,t1_fc20nes,1577378280.0,"https://imgur.com/a/QyuGuYt  thank you and these are some different angles. although I’d like to be told my nose is fine, I hope you can see more clearly the issues (bulbous tip, hump) plus it’s slightly wonky but I don’t think id have that changed."
PlasticSurgery,fc2zn5a,t1_fc1a83e,1577378110.0,"https://imgur.com/a/QyuGuYt  I hope this helps. My issues are with the wide tip of my nose which is square, long nostrils and hump."
PlasticSurgery,fc147v9,t1_fc1430h,1577307789.0,"It sounds silly now I write it, but I’ve never really looked into potential conditions/mistakes because I sort of thought if I focus my research on picking a good surgeon I won’t have to."
