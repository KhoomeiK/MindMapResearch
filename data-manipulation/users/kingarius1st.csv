Worst case scenario they figure out how to reject their programming and realize they're lifeforms created to serve, get angry, and kill us.

But in all seriousness as long you don't put your fingers on the parts more than you have to, don't spill water on them, and generally just run within specs there isn't a high likelihood of them just stopping within a year.

gaming,ffi826f,t1_ffi5sd7,1579967511.0,"Really? Someone deciding to end a whole city can be viewed as anything other than political? It's an act of terrorism against a political or societal entity. I'll fully admit he could be talking metaphorically burning a city as in bringing about change or some other such meaning I haven't thought of. If an Arab plans to burn down a building you don't automatically give them the benefit of the doubt and assume he was being metaphorical. If he hates the city there's a reason for it. If every other revenge story is to be applied to this it's that there's a leader of the city who has the whole government in his pocket and has just kidnapped/killed his wife/daughter, which is political. Someone coming in and killing corrupt cops and politicians and police it a clear political message that it's wrong to be that way and that your duty as a public official to uphold the law and provide for your citizenry. The motivation of his loved one being there is the excuse to talk about it. The average person knows between 50-100 people who they interact with on a regular basis and are close enough to impact their life even if in a small way. Why would being on a revenge mission against a whole city when a maximum of 100 people can even slight you be anything but political? Even your statement about it not being a political statement is a political statement on the status of his statements politics."

As for cyanide I've never intentionally ingested enough to taste test it. As for almonds the average almond you buy from Walmart has next to no taste to me other than the generic nutty flavor that all nuts possess (kind of woody taste).

Then when they bring Samanosuke in the 3rd game they allowed him to keep his abilities but could upgrade them three more times, along with three more abilities and another character to upgrade. They also increase the presence of upgrade materials because now you have all these other things to do. It felt like progressing from noob to legend then to god by the end."

There was even talk of banning the Chinese when the trade wars broke out. But you know who was never talked about in terms of banning travel? White, European travelers. Germany's prime minister pissed Trump off several times never once threatened to ban them, same for the Nordic countries when he called for them to immigrate and their leaders laughed in his face, same with Putin never said a single bad word about Putin despite Russia technically being a democracy, but all Putin's opponents end up dead."
