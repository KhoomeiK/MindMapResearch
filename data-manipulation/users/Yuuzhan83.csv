Unfortunately, it's still around to a degree. 

Religion doesn't help with that as has been said and it resulted in past women and a few today, to dislike sex and use it for control as it was one of the few options left for them. 

I think tho that it's getting better as modern people are realizing women that enjoy sex are a good thing."
