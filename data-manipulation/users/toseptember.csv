Assistance,ff8z979,t3_e7z3hq,1579700737.0,"If someone wants to help you they will send you the money via PayPal, Cashapp, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Zelle. You donâ€™t give someone your personal banking account numbers to make a deposit. Thatâ€™s a red flag. At most you need to give them your email and/or name. Someone said they would help me, but requested my bank account number. I knew right away that was a scam. I stopped responding to them."

u_toseptember,fez5ylz,t1_feyzj1p,1579454115.0,No. Iâ€™m still looking. Iâ€™m going to apply to some places soon. I found an apt I like. I donâ€™t start working until Feb 18th. I was supposed to start jan 21st. They changed the date. Hopefullyâ€”I get approved. Many of the resources expect you to live in low income poverty stricken areas. I just need money to get back on my feet. Nothing wrong with me. Just having trouble finding a job. I have a Bachelorâ€™s Degree and Juris Doctor.

Charlotte,fckn61a,t3_ehou3k,1577728946.0,"What are you confused about? 

Does your father own the car with no car note payments? 

If so, he can go to the GA DMV and transfer the title to you. 

After that change the current the policy to youâ€”or buy a new policy. Then return to the DMV in Charlotte to register your car"

AskWomen,fcje8hp,t3_ehhubv,1577684504.0,"I just go to the gym. I donâ€™t think about. I tell myself Iâ€™m going to do 30 minutes just to convince myself even more to go. Also find a workout routine you enjoy. You donâ€™t need a gym per se. To me the gym gym is boring with too many people. I donâ€™t have the ability to do pole fitness right now, but Iâ€™d choose pole over the gymâ€”faster results. There are many workouts out there"
