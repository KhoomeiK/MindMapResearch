I was exhausted, it was the middle of the night, and the Big Voice woke me up just enough to think, ""Fuck it, I'll either die right away, or they'll take care of it,"" and passed right back out. My platoon sergeant ended up getting me out of bed for accountability later that night, so the insurgents still won. Bastards."

Barely related, but I returned a lost dog that way. She didn't have a name tag, just a rabies tag with vet contact info and a serial number. The vet was able to ID the dog and owner off the serial and I gave them my number to relay to the owner. Momma got her baby back within the hour, and the vet didn't have to compromise their client's privacy."

todayilearned,fcxm160,t1_fcxecep,1578066176.0,"Right. They're accusing someone in the house of being a pedo. But police have no clue who did it, so it seems like a bit of a leap to conclude which of the two occupants was the target, and that it was a misunderstanding of the doctor's profession. Occam's Razer says that's probably what happened, but the graffiti is literally the only clue to go on, and doesn't seem sufficient enough to conclude the thought process of the criminals."
AmItheAsshole,fcxlo2w,t1_fcxdpz2,1578065935.0,"I think that's actually a pretty good pro-tip. Scrub as much demographical information as possible from your resume so employers only have the information you want them to judge you by. If you can get away with it, I'd say do it."
AmItheAsshole,fcx9i2q,t1_fcwuaff,1578056419.0,"Years ago, I read an article in Psychology Today about how people were losing out on job opportunities because businesses were unconsciously judging their resumes based on their names: if the resume had an unusual name (i.e. African-American name, unusual spelling, or stereotypically poor/trashy names), that person was less likely to get an interview. Some companies may have been doing it on purpose, but the point of the article was that even those actively trying not to discriminate did it without realizing.

For a while, I worked for a rental company, and part of my job was screening tenant applications and sending recommendations to our clients on whether or not they should accept an application. Every time I saw a unique name, I would stop and remind myself that the applicant didn't pick that name. More often than not, I'd think something like, ""This poor SOB had real asshole parents"" before moving on and reviewing their actual qualifications. I figured calling attention to it and reminding myself their name is not their fault might prevent me from subconsciously denying someone a home just because their parents apparently hate them.

I say all that to say the girl you met didn't spell it ""KeightLynn."" Her *parents* spell it ""KeightLynn."" And apparently they hate her."
