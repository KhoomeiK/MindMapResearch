internetparents,ffi3hb4,t3_etr9cb,1579963996.0,Definitely contact film and TV offices around your town to ask for a weeks work experience and even put in you would work for free. A lot of them might not give you any contact back but one out of 10 1 out of 50 might say yes

Edit: i know the bbc used to do an apprenticeship type thing so you could maybe read into that?"

What she had with her SO is something she can never replace so it will always hold dear to her. But your relationship is different, and will be very special to her for different reasons. 

I get that you think they were perfect and you are just kinda 'second best' however it's really not like that.. it's more just a different pathway and different connections. She has found love from different things she once did not ever consider. 

I get that you think if her SO didn't die you would not be with her... but there's so many things that applies to as well... like it's the 'what if' scenario that doesn't really help to think about because it's not relevant i suppose."

Life is so hard to navigate, and at times you may feel like you're doing wrong or you could be better. you really should never beat yourself up about this stuff.. and trust me I know that's easier said than done, but you had your life to live too. 

Things will be okay soon, i promise... maybe look up the 'ball in the box analogy' for grief. It helped me a lot. Life at times really does suck. But deep down you know that your mom loved you and she wanted you to be okay and that is all that matters"
offmychest,feguw11,t3_eozaas,1579103069.0,"Firstly, I am so sorry to hear your news. It must be so hard to deal with.

Secondly, I couldn't agree more. There are very little people on this earth (if any at all) that do things just out of niceness. I always say, people are only there when it suits them. I've had a tough year for various small things and my friends were only there when it suited them.. like when we were at college and they would only ask if I was okay or go out to lunch to 'check in' just so they can get answers to assignments/projects. It really sucks. People don't mean to  I suppose, I think it's subconsciously like they will give you time so you can later on give me help or validation or a favour. It's also (in my opinion) to do with them FEELING like they are good friends/people. I told some friends I was having a really hard time and they just made a new group chat without me.. because we just finished college so I think its cos I didnt have anything else to give them"

&#x200B;

I was in a skiing club and I was practising as it was competition day. Fell onto my arm badly and I was crying out in pain (which I normally would not do) and had to be carried away off the slope. My parents were there and seen that I was hurting a lot. Another kid's parent came up to check me out (she was a nurse) and said I was totally fine (as if she had xray vision). So because of this nurse my parents said I was ok to race and I still had to compete - bearing in mind that skiers need to hold poles and pull themselves down the slope. I looked so stupid as I only had one pole as the pain was that bad! A week later we went to my dad's friend's house and he also checked my arm out as he is a doctor. He also said I was totally fine (again, as if he had xray vision).

Two weeks later, after my sister constantly hitting my arm saying I'm doing it for attention, my mom notices that there's a large lump and tells my dad to take me to the emergency room. Turns out it was broken and starting to push through (which is what the lump was). In a cast for 4 weeks and got a lot of mcdonalds and ice cream as an 'i'm sorry we fucked up' gesture."
lonely,fegpifl,t3_ep2y9n,1579099467.0,"Ok so first things first.. it will be hard but you go and get out of the bath! Just one step at a time, ok! :) Just get out... maybe lay in your towel for ages like everyone does haha. Then, once you feel ready (or simmilarly, feel fidgety or like you have been there too long) try and take another small step... if you haven't dried off, maybe dry off and put on some pj's.   
Once you've done these steps you're basically ready and dressed, so well fucking done!!!!   


if you havent cried in a while... why don't you watch a sad movie and get it all out? sometimes it doesnt help but a lot of the time the act of crying can make a small difference! I am Sam is a sad movie (i've not seen it but it looks so sad from trailers!), or just go to one that makes you cry! 

  
If not... pick something completely opposite. This should be the biggest decision you make today! If you want something upbeat... Brooklyn 99 is good.. or otherwise something that gives you fond memories! 

&#x200B;

Basically.. take it a step at a time. Just make very small decisions like what hoodie to wear, what to eat, what to watch. You don't need to make big decisions yet. Just take things slow...

Also, Virgin used to have a 'best fare finder' section and you would put in your dates and I would always get a return for around £90 at the most (from Glasgow to London). Obviously it's now Avanti or something like that.. you could always try look for the best fare section if they have one?"

Those aren't big hobbies but it gives you so much opportunity to do anything. You could knit, draw, sing or even dance. you'll notice the time more, in the morning you can make a decent breakfast... or even just read/plan your day.. and in the evening you can get an earlier routine in bed.

I think if you let them know you're having a hard time... especially if you were getting such good grades, they should be ok?

Over here your exam results are based on your grades, but they also take into account any personal circumstances you may have. They also take into consideration all of your results as a whole... if you're getting great grades then suddenly they drop, they try and give you the benefit of the doubt depending on the circumstance.

But regardless of the way I handle things, I wouldn't tell anyone else to do/not do something. Each person has a right to deal with their trauma in their own way. If it isn't addressed properly it could definitely spiral into something bigger. I notice in myself that if/when I can connect a trait of mine to my childhood (e.g. why i do or don't do certain things) i feel better because I am understanding myself and understanding my life.  If pinning all of someone's hardships onto their childhood helps them reflect and makes them feel better about their situation then who are you to tell them not to? the way you've written the title of this thread makes it seem like you don't think people can have a tough childhood, at least in comparison to yours.  Maybe you need to realise that everyone's trauma is different, and while you might think it is 'lesser' to someone else, it can still be a lot for someone to handle and they need to deal with that how they see fit."
