AskReddit,fdes8wh,t1_fdd2psn,1578345532.0,"My best friend at the time got me into Mary Kay at a time I was super struggling with bills.  I went in with eyes wide open and incredibly reluctantly because I hate and *loathe* making presentations and I am NOT the extrovert she is.  I went to an MK conference St. Louis with her and oh man.  The Kool-Aid that was being drunk that weekend was intense.  I hated every minute of it.  I sold maybe $250 worth of stuff, bought a bunch more, but when I decided to dip about 6 months later, I sold all of my MK stuff back to them.  I will say that for them that they actually will give you 90% of the price of the product so long as it isn't horribly out of date.  I was warned I'd never be allowed to be a consultant again.  I was not sad about that.  

My friend had (and probably still has) massive boxes full of shit that she doesn't use and doesn't sell.  She stopped doing MK for a bit then got back into it about 2 or so years later.  She tried to get me to sign up again and I said, ""Nope.  They said I couldn't become a consultant again.""  She said, ""Well they probably would let you back in if you bought enough product.""  I laughed in her face and asked her with what money.  She dropped it after that.

In the end I spent about $1000 for $250 back ($650 counting the $400 of product I returned).  I feel very lucky and still very stupid."

I couldn't tell you the name of the restaurant, but I remember it being on the main stretch of road.  Also, this was almost 25 years ago so I don't know if the place even exists anymore.
