I did my share of acid in college, and I don’t think it’s some evil drug. That said, acid use at Ted’s age at the time of the experiments, combined with other factors at play including psychological torture, had to have taken their toll."

nfl,fe6l0dh,t1_fe6km8m,1578894406.0,Exactly. Packers could’ve scored another TD if we failed to convert that 4th down.
nfl,fe6hiom,t1_fe6c2c5,1578891073.0,It was 4th and 11 and we had three timeouts and the two minute warning.

Seahawks,fe6bimp,t1_fe6akxq,1578886221.0,Pete literally said in the presser that they were well aware of the matchup too. He just said they “hoped he could make a play” or something to that effect. So frustrating.

nfl,fdffuor,t1_fdfblnl,1578360719.0,Others replying are forgetting to mention that this largely depends on whether you live East or west of the Cascade mountains. Western Washington is rainy most of the year with little snow. Eastern Washington gets significantly colder and there’s much more snow. It’s almost like a different state.
