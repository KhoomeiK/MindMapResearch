AmItheAsshole,fdaas7j,t3_ek9l6l,1578243824.0,"Totally  NTA. Manipulators always twist it to make you feel guilty or bad, especially narcissists. They actively work to cut their spouse’s family and friends off, and often focus an unreasonable hatred on one person trying corrupt the view of the spouse. 

You are under no obligation to take part in her sick fucking head games. Uncle has made his choice, and whether you like it or not, it’s his choice and he’s made it. 

Conversely, you have done the same thing. You choose to take no part in her bullshit because it’s the wisest and healthiest course of action for your well being. 

Don’t give it another thought. 
Don’t waste one moment playing her game-it’s what she most wants. 
Walk through this earth calmly and peacefully, discarding people who would steal this from you. 

And take care of Grandma."

AmItheAsshole,fd9vrk0,t3_ekb6tr,1578238663.0,"YTA Unpopular opinion here but when folks are sick and in pain, the utter bullshit in a hospital setting makes it so much worse. Add that to apathetic nurses who don’t give a shit if you live or die, and it’s a recipe for saying *anything* that might get you help faster. 

I’m speaking from multiple personal experiences in hospitals. I’ve worked in hospitals. And yes, the apathy is real. 

A kinder, more compassionate response would not be unwarranted by a medical professional. 

PS And yes, of course, there are phenomenal nurses out there but in response to this particular post, I stand by my YTA response."
