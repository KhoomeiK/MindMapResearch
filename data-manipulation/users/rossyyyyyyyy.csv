Dogtraining,ffnoptg,t1_ffnjbjl,1580068657.0,That's amazing! I'm happy to hear that.
Dogtraining,ffncp2i,t1_ffnadrf,1580064340.0,"French bulldogs can't breathe properly, it's cruel to continue breeding purebred frenchies. Please don't support that. 

If you really want a French bulldog find a breed specific rescue or someone who's rehoming their dog, that way you won't support the breeding of more inbred dogs. Another option would be finding someone who crossbreeds frenchies for example with beagles."
pitbulls,ffkgtue,t1_ffjtphs,1580022525.0,yup dogs can definitely have favorite cars too. My dog prefers my mom's golf over our Mercedes because she has less space and it keeps her a bit calmer
pitbulls,ffj4swi,t1_ffj4d1p,1579990400.0,haha vivid imaginations are always fun
pitbulls,ffj49eq,t1_ffj3xsj,1579990004.0,yes not those type of trunks where people get kidnapped in but those open type of trunks idk the name for it tbh
pitbulls,ffizs2a,t1_ffiz8r5,1579986775.0,"in a crash situation it would lock due to the forces. Try pulling your seatbelt out really quickly, it'll lock. The walking part makes sense but it doesn't cause problems for us since our seatbelt doesn't provide enough space for our dog to get in the front.


She's never in the front seat, we usually have her in the trunk and sometimes in the backseat"
pitbulls,ffiyw3k,t1_ffiq1eq,1579986127.0,why not the type where the seatbelt is run through?
IDmydog,ffit6ne,t1_ffismaf,1579982099.0,"I agree it's not always bad, there's just a risk of supporting irresponsible breeding. I don't think what you did is bad, that dog probably would've ended up in a shelter or dumped if no one had taken him/her. 
I just wouldn't encourage anyone to buy puppies off of Craigslist as it is likely that they come from backyard breeders, puppy mills or just people who have no idea how to prevent dog pregnancies."
IDmydog,ffih3rb,t1_ffigeis,1579973726.0,"ah okay, not really a fan of ""normal"" people breeding their dogs but whatever its better than supporting a puppy mill or something like that"
IDmydog,ffiegma,t1_ffi1u9b,1579971922.0,Please don't buy a dog from Craigslist again
DogAdvice,ffawyjq,t1_ffawlhs,1579746417.0,haha no problem. Its one of my fave subs
Dogtraining,ff95ruq,t1_ff95765,1579705503.0,ohh okay that makes sense
Dogtraining,ff9368h,t1_ff8yv4e,1579703712.0,all the staffies I know have a loooot of energy
Dogtraining,ff8ott7,t3_es2kle,1579689442.0,"why crate him? I'm not totally against crates and I think they're great for puppies but not every dog needs to be crated you know.. I don't know anyone who crates their dog and they're all doing great (it's not really a thing in europe, idk where America's weird obsession with crates comes from tbh)"

Glad he's ok at home!"
rawpetfood,ff406vm,t1_fd77yhg,1579552681.0,it's on youtube too but low quality
rawpetfood,ff3zn1w,t3_ek563a,1579552342.0,"I'm actually in the same situation. Im 16 years old but I paid for everything and do all the training etc. however my parents were against a raw diet (too expensive, too much to prep, thought kibble is just as healthy) 
I showed them documentaries, I kept talking about it and compared prices but they didn't change their minds so eventually I just started taking their raw meat, eggs and vegetables and they obviously got tired of that.. 
After a while they just let me buy it myself (I recommend going to a butcher and asking for leftovers such as bones and buying meat there bc it's much cheaper than ordering prepared raw meals online, at least where I live) Seeing the changes in our/my dog has actually convinced them and they're now on board and support me but I still have to do and pay for everything myself but that's fine with me, I'm the one who wanted a dog"
aww,ff3o6pj,t1_ff3i79v,1579545252.0,why would backyard breeders want them human aggressive? don't most backyard bred pits end up in dog fighting rings? because if they do they'd want dog aggressive but human friendly dogs
aww,ff3lh2j,t1_ff3cw0n,1579543576.0,"I always get real bones from the butcher, I get them for free because they'd throw them away anyway and they last for a few hours :) might be a little hard to digest for some dogs idk but we raw feed our dog and bc of that her stomach is used to those types of meals"
aww,ff3hnuy,t1_ff3bn2x,1579541245.0,r/banpitbulls
rescuedogs,ff3hfqb,t1_ff2qu0w,1579541105.0,wow our dog has the same issues. She's a rescue too. Her anxiety is getting better but she used to try to jump out of the window for the first few weeks when left alone..
rescuedogs,ff2857o,t1_ff0k0bk,1579496586.0,He definitely looks healthy now
rescuedogs,feyddqh,t3_equjqx,1579444092.0,what's his story?
aww,fepytzh,t1_fepj04w,1579334903.0,I'm glad she found a loving home
aww,fept15y,t1_fepltwj,1579330275.0,I'm sorry for your loss. I don't think this helps but my dog is called Ginny too
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fekwori,t1_fekwetk,1579209158.0,ohh good luck convincing him!
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fekvh6v,t1_feksrop,1579208439.0,then adopt another dog :)
CaneCorso,fegxkfm,t1_feguvti,1579104771.0,oh that may be because of the loose skin but I'm not sure since I've never used a prong collar before. I walk a great dane (they also have that loose skin) and it can get annoying even with normal flat collars sometimes
aww,fegl9sf,t1_fefr3y0,1579096266.0,what is it? I can't view it because I'm in Europe
DogAdvice,feehlsb,t1_feeh1d5,1579033915.0,that's weird never heard of a dog preferring booties before lmao
DogAdvice,feegqe7,t1_feega2i,1579033413.0,my dog hates them too and forgot how to dog at first but after a while she got used to them haha
reactivedogs,fee827m,t1_fee7jg1,1579028323.0,good luck!
CaneCorso,fee6d58,t3_eolsrt,1579027326.0,Handsome dog :) I just wanted to say that the prong collar should be higher up the neck. It's supposed to be right under the jaw and ears. If it's too loose you can take a few prongs out there are lots of tutorials on youtube
DogAdvice,fee5zjv,t3_eoov5g,1579027102.0,You should buy booties (dog shoes) for her and possibly a coat too
reactivedogs,fee39mm,t3_eonjeq,1579025493.0,"We used to have the same problem: she didn't mind the muzzle at all until we started walking.. 
I just gave her a treat after every single step in the beginning and then after 2 steps etc. With a lot of time and patience it'll work out. Keep the training sessions short. 
We can now go on walks with the muzzle on but she still gets a treat every minute or so"
dogs,feav9bi,t1_fe9m2dw,1578952510.0,I hope OP sees this
slammywhammies,fe50dxd,t3_enp67k,1578864527.0,Hey I just wanted to say that your prong collar should be higher up his neck. You should look it up there are lots of pics on how to properly fit a prong collar
AnimalsBeingDerps,fe4n30e,t1_fe4ko6n,1578860995.0,that's great to hear. I'm glad you care about animals such as mice too
AnimalsBeingDerps,fe4h9vw,t1_fe4gcgn,1578859271.0,That's one of the reasons I have a long lead for my dog but if I'm walking on a sidewalk near a busy road she's still on a short leash
AnimalsBeingDerps,fe4fz1h,t1_fe4e36l,1578858888.0,"I'm really glad you were able to stop in time. 
Our neighbors used to have two dogs until one got hit by a car and they still let their current dog off leash on the sidewalk. I just don't get it. They've already lost a dog that way, they should know better."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fe4bs6z,t1_fe3zq1p,1578857685.0,people should never let their dogs off leash near a road no matter how well trained it may be. A dog can get scared by something and jump on the road. And even really well trained dogs can make a simple but fatal mistake..
SphynxCats,fe4a25r,t3_ena1ow,1578857224.0,wow those ears are huge

lookatmydog,fdo6nzr,t3_ema9lp,1578599823.0,I don't get why anyone would support the breeding of these inbred dogs that can't even breathe properly.. sure they are cute but there are many cute breeds that don't have these issues. Please don't support this by giving them your money
Dogberg,fdkqe3t,t1_fb3b4lu,1578508979.0,any dog with a little bit of prey drive would do that if given the opportunity.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdgpml5,t1_fdga0mk,1578404970.0,I'm sure she has a dogbed..
IDmydog,fdgo2kq,t1_fdf29vl,1578403668.0,he could be a carpathian shepherd mix. it's a Romanian breed.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fd4wehk,t1_fa1dfjt,1578171666.0,I absolutely love pits but I agree that this is a fucked up thing to do

reactivedogs,fc6esmi,t3_egekct,1577478868.0,"I've never experienced this but I guess you could ask strangers to toss her some treats walking past her. I'd recommend starting off by completely ignoring the dog while tossing the treats and after a few times let them repeat the same thing but with eye contact. Gradually build it up and don't expect too much from your dog, this issue won't be fixed after doing it once. Your dog has to learn her current response to things is not wanted and at the same time has to learn an alternative behavior. It'll take time.  

Do not push your dog to interact with people, if she clearly shows that she's uncomfortable take a step back.  
She may never be a dog that can be pet by strangers and that's ok."
