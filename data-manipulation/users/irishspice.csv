flatearth,ffg4jaw,t3_etey7u,1579898300.0,"One thing your will find if you go down this rabbit hole is that flatties are *not* nice people. My own research into them has found many mentions of personality disorder, especially narcissism. The [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect) is frequently used because they think they know more than they actually do. One of the most vocal of them u/maracass was banned by Reddit for her incredibly vicious attacks on Muslims and she was none too nice to globe believers either. 

If you see an article I posted on [Patricia Steere](https://old.reddit.com/r/flatearth/comments/erownw/i_found_why_patricia_steere_left_youtube_and_the/) who is a lovely woman who was in Netflix's [""Behind the Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_the_Curve.)  She and her Youtube channel vanished abruptly shortly after. It turns out that she fell in love with another flat earther and was then raped and abused by him. The rest of the FE community, instead of rallying around her, attacked her. She was even accused of being a transexual. The video I linked to is her telling her story. It's a tough watch but it tells a lot about the kind of people this movement attracts. 

If you go to some of the real FE subs you will be treated rudely and probably banned. Most of us have suffered the same treatment just for wanting to know why they believe what they do. FE is an interesting rabbit hole to wander though but it's full of thorns and people with egos much larger than their IQ."
