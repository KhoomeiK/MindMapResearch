AnimalsBeingJerks,ffj22zv,t1_ffikkk2,1579988447.0,"Not my cat - friend’s cat. But you’re right. She is. Last time she did this to me, I made the mistake of going near her and she attacked my leg. I still have scars. But she pretends to be all lovey dovey when her human is around."

ereader,fehoct5,t3_eoxjdn,1579120618.0,"I've got a [Kobo Libra](https://ca.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-h2o) and absolutely love it. It's shaped like the Kindle Oasis and it has a really great yellow/orange light for night time reading. Kobo has the best e-reading experience as well as the UI is customizable and pleasing to see. Oh, and I use calibre to add ebooks to it."
