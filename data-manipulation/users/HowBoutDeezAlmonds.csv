I started stripping when I was 18 after a traumatic event. Recently clean off drugs, but drank alcohol. 

Anyways.  I made they money that I set out to achieve my goal. I didn't get back on drugs (even though there was a plethora of them). 

I did, however, drink. I would drive home intoxicated enough to get a dui. Not wasted, but buzzed. Most of the time. Sometimes I would get carried away. Sometimes I'd have to call a ride home. 

Never on drugs though. Never did ""extra favors"" for money.  Yes, the offer was there lots of times. The money was tempting. Thank god i was on birth control which killed my sex drive. Nowadays, 10 years later & nearing 30, off birth control; I think I'd fuck anything that was hard enough. Wanna pay me for it? Dope. 

But nah. Your man is jealous. Not his fault technically...cause this is 100% a case of insecurity. 

Do you. If he can't handle it..let him move on. If you can collect the dough and maintain a level head...then you'd be stupid not to. Men with beautiful, smart women should be intimidated, yet grateful. But not to the point that they make you feel bad for being awesome.

There's levels to it, sure. But I've fucked my life up the most cause alcohol. And its also the funnest to me. Maybe cause the social acceptance and the fact that it takes longer to notice the negative effects of alcoholism. I think my favorite thing about booze is the relief of anxiety.
