politics,fewk4y4,t1_fewdw1e,1579412365.0,"OK so you want Bernie to be the progressive version of Trump, ignoring the law, acting like he is only leader of half the country, and so on?

Also, what is he actually getting done? Nothing on healthcare. He got tax cuts because he has the senate. His other policies on things like immigration are just for show -- Republicans have convinced their supporters (falsely) that Mexican immigrants are a huge part of our economic problems so he needs to be a dick on that. And with his tariffs, he's just fucking up our long term trade prospects while not doing anything. And again, he's doing this because Republicans have the Senate locked up (which happens, by the way, mostly because Republican have a massive demographic advantage where they can win a bunch of senate seats in red states and carry the senate with like 30% of the country actually voting for those assholes).

You Bernie people have all made up your minds that the Democratic party has fucked things up and so we need Bernie to solve things. But the real problem is the impossible demographics of the country, the massive advantages Republicans have, and their subsequent ability to just block Democratic policies. So you guys blame Obama and other Democrats for being too moderate, failing to understand that so much of his agenda was just stonewalled. And now your solution is to go *even further left* and only support someone who has essentially vowed to just try to blow up the system. It's eerily similar to the logic people used to vote for Trump: ""well, everyone else has fucked up, so let's vote for this wildcard."" Bernie is a much better person than Trump, obviously, but I see similar extreme division in the country and a future of no political cooperation, no progress on anything.

I mean you and your other Bernie supporters express zero desire or willingness to compromise and cooperate with moderate Democrats on anything. You openly express that you don't want to cooperate, that you think all moderates are feckless scum. And I'm supposed to think you're going to build a coalition and win Congress and get his agenda passed? Bernie's supporters are literally demonstrating with the way you talk about him and the way you talk about other candidates that you won't be cooperative, that you don't understand why politics always involves compromise (because the alternative is getting nothing done).

The response to what I'm saying is predictably ""you are the problem. This is why we don't get progressive policies passed."" Which totally ignores that I want those policies and I'm only explaining that there are tens of millions of moderate people who you're going to have to meet halfway if you want to get anything done. And by the time you meet them halfway, your ideas and goals are watered down. It's just what always happens. It is reality.

""But Bernie will be different!!!!!"" Right? This is the magical thinking I'm talking about. ""Things are going to happen that haven't happened before."" OK sure."
politics,few3x1f,t1_fevz2yq,1579404995.0,"How is that an answer? ""keeping his grass roots supporters active."" How is that an answer to the strong possibility (based on lots of past evidence) that his brand of anti-capitalist progressivism is likely to motivate conservatives and moderates to reject his agenda and vote in a lot of Republicans? How is that a strategy? That is not a strategy. That is just a nebulous thing you hope will be enough to address the problem.

And so even though you don't see it, what you are saying sounds like you think it's magic, because you're rejecting some common things that happen when you have a candidate who tries to go so far in one direction, away from the mainstream, and work outside the confines of the existing system and dismantle it.

I will fully acknowledge here that I am using speculation and political logic and I do not know what will happen. Maybe Bernie can win and win Congress too. But him and ""the squad"" are among a small group of national politicians who are as progressive as him. And he refuses to even join the Democratic Party. He has never shown a desire to strongly work with other politicians on important issues. 

I will applaud you for at least acknoweldging that yes, we need the Senate to flip (so many Bernie supporters seem to not even be considering what will happen in Congress if he wins). But still, I wish people like you would show a bit more modesty about your predictions too and present them as hopes that you aren't sure about. I don't get the whole ""i'm putting all of my eggs in the Bernie basket"" attitude. Everyone who supports Bernie should at the very least see Warren as a great next choice. The fact that they don't makes me very skeptical of where their support even comes from (it makes me think many of them don't really know anything about politics).

Having said all of that, if he wins the nomination, I genuinely would support him and hope things work out. But since we aren't there yet, I'm going to keep pushing for Warren, who I think wants to do everything that Bernie wants but she has more political capital in the Democratic Party and I think she's more likely to build a coalition -- based on her record of working with her peers on major policy, based on attracting both progressives and moderates, and so on. And I just don't see Bernie Sanders or his supporters coming up with a convincing argument for how he's going to build the kind of coalition that will be necessary to get anything done."
politics,fevuk1h,t1_fevt2jr,1579401692.0,"It's insane. Bernie and Biden aren't even boomers. They're literally older than boomers and we elected our first boomer president in 1992. They're both older than Bill Clinton -- so is Trump.

politics,fevm6i6,t1_fevkbfm,1579398993.0,"I also just don't really understand why he thinks it's a good idea for him to be president.

The biggest problem I have is this: he wants to blow up the system. He doesn't really want to work within the confines of our system of capitalism and try to fix it. He wants to give  us a quasi system of socialism.

Now, I wouldn't actually be totally against this...if I thought it as possible, if I thought he has realistic plans to make it happen, if I thought he could get the cooperation he needs to enact his policies. But my concern is that (A) his candidacy will cause voters to swing the other way in many places and Democrats will lose Congress, and (B) even many of the existing Democrats in Congress will refuse to go along with some of his more progressive policies.

Warren, I think, would be much better at building coalitions, cooperation, making people optimistic for Democrats being in charge. And with her, I think we'd see more people voting for Democrats in every race.

So I just don't think Bernie's voters are properly consider that, even if he wins, he may have extreme difficulty getting anything done. They just think hes going to have a magical effect on politics and everything he wants he will get. Or, if you really push them, they say ""I don't care if he gets nothing done, because it can't be worse than what else we would have."" They have built a cult around him and can't see how another candidate would be more effective at getting support and a coalition that would make real change happen."
politics,fevkj9p,t1_fet5x4v,1579398481.0,"I applaud your reconsideration of the facts.

Having said that, you've pinpointed something that I think a lot of Republican voters would or should find shocking. Specifically, most Republican voters think that they have honest differences with Democratic voters, that Republicans support Republican policies because those policies are good for Republican voters (and maybe they even believe those policies are better for the country than Democratic policies).

But the reality, as you have discovered, is that Republican policies do not help most people. The middle class people (and even upper middle class people) voting for those policies are just voting for things that they think are good for them, not having enough time or expertise to see how bad Republican policies are for most people.

To a large extent, I think what happens is they hear what the most liberal of people say about what they want, like really leftist things like socialized medicine, more LGBTQ rights, basically lots of progressive economic and social policies. And then those Republican voters say ""well, I'm much different than those people, so I can't vote for who they vote for.""

Except the irony is that most of the Democrats winning elections and making policy are much more moderate than the most liberal of voters. And those Democratic policies are better for almost everyone in American -- everyone except for maybe the top 10% of income earners.

But nope, Republicans have seemanaged to divide us into two nearly equal-sized groups and the independent voters fluctuate every few years so that Republicans and Democrats win a similar number of elections. And because Republican policy is so much further right than Democratic policy, the overall policies we get are always to the right of center and most of us lose."

And just to take this a bit further, let's face it -- when a guy invests all of his time into trying to become president, traveling the country, doing speeches, participating in debates, constantly talking to reporters, organizing with volunteers, devoting all day every day to running for president, taking ridiculous abuse from all kinds of people. etc....

politics,fery88r,t1_fepv2fa,1579359553.0,"Here's the way I see it:

3) Bernie likes Elizabeth Warren -- likes her politics, likes her as a person. But he does not want Elizabeth Warren to be president.

4) Elizabeth Warren knows that Bernie wants to be president.

So when we establish all of that, when Bernie says to Warren ""well, I think Trump will weaponize misogyny,"" that's something she knows and so she's thinking ""why is he saying this to me?

politics,fep1rw8,t1_fenr5u3,1579310211.0,"I think the explanation is more pathetic than putting up blinders.

They like Trump and they think his policies are good for them (for most of them, this isn't actually true, but that's a separate conversation).

Information is utilitarian -- all of it either hurts their cause to keep Trump as president or it helps their cause. So because the end they desire is for Trump to be president, they seek for information that serves that end. All other information is unhelpful to that end goal. So that information is simply discarded or ignored.

For them, there is no reason to consider difference in the seriousness of information (and by the way, let's not forget that the information we're talking about is actually things that people have done -- sometimes very harmful things that have hurt people). But let's say, for example, that Trump is engaged in rampant conspiracy (because he is), like doing nothing about the murder of a US journalist in the Saudi Embassy, or Trump killing the Iranian General without informing Congress, or kids in cages, or refusing to assist Puerto Rico, and so much more, or that his daughter her husband are working in jobs in the White House that they are totally unqualified to do.

And then let's also acknowledge that it's sadly kind of normal but shitty that Hunter Biden got overpaid a ton of money working for some Ukrainian company -- and that he got that position partly because he was the US Vice President's son. He was probably more qualified for that job than Ivanka was to be a White House senior advisor, by the way, but whatever.

So I don't even think the ""blinders"" explanation properly conveys the craziness of the obvious hypocrisy. It's not even a consideration ever for a second to think about how the corruption by Trump is on a magnitude much greater than anything Democrats are doing or have done. It's just a crazy extreme asymmetry in the hypocrisy -- like, the assymetry is so extreme that it hypothetically justifies just ignoring Democratic corruption and talking all day about the insane corruption by Republicans.

But nope, the conversation we often have is ""well, Republicans are corrupt but so are Democrats."" It's so mindbogglingly stupid, I can't even think about it without getting frustrated."

A second possibility is that given that all of the guys on that page have coats on, it looks to me like they have basically pulled the ""thin"" end of the tie down lower than normal and purposely tied the knot with the wider part of the tie closer to the top.

The best classic knot to tie is called a Windsor knot. It's superior to the most popular and slightly easier knot, which is called [the Four in Hand knot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&v=9BMhFmNzw-o&feature=emb_logo).

Yes, the Four in Hand knot will work, but it sucks. The basic problem with the Four in Hand knot is that it does not produce the kind of symmetric knot you want (the knot comes out crooked). And so the ""why"" of why you should use the Windsor knot is that you want the knot to come out in the shape of an upside down triangle.

So you know when you put a tie around your neck, there's two sides. And so you know that in order to produce that upside down triangle knot, you'll need to create a bit of bulk on each side, which is why -- after you put one side over the other side of the tie -- you need to wrap the tie under and through one side and then under and through the other side. Now you've created the bulk for each side of your upside down triangle, and then it's just wrapping it over to create the face of the triangle and then under and through the face and down.

Further, Zimmer has done this with great ownership who are willing to spend whatever is necessary to get better. Green didn't have that and neither did any coach who worked with previous owners. The Wilfs put up big money for players and coaching talent and all of that money helps to cover for Zimmer's shortcomings, making it seem like he's a better coach than he is.

I think it's a lot more than just Belicheck and Pederson who are better than Zimmer. Andy Reid is one. Also Tomlin, Arians, Carroll. Then there's guys who show the potential to be better, like Shanahan, LaFleur, McVay, and arguably some others.

Further, it's important to note that only 6 coaches have been head coach for their current team longer than Zimmer. So even if some guys with a few years or less are maybe not going to be better than him, they are still in the process of proving how good they can be. Zimmer has had 6 years and they've plateaued. It's time to move on.

Get rid of Zimmer and Spielman. Start fresh."
minnesotavikings,fee2hyo,t1_fedqoal,1579025036.0,"I don't think it's fair to say that people were ""surprised"" we lost to SF. Who was ""surprised?""

I think you are mistaking surprise for disappointment about the perpetual mediocrity of this team with the current coaches and GM. How long do you accept this kind of mediocrity before you move on?

It is clear that Zimmer is not among the elite coaches. I think to be considered an elite coach, in six years you should at least once be competitive in a league championship game. But the best the Vikings have done is barely beat New Orleans in 2017 (when New Orleans was a lower seed in that game, and the Vikings blew a 17-0 lead to let NO take the lead). Then they got blown out by Philadelphia in the NFC championship.

I've seen enough. Bring in a guy who hasn't gotten a chance yet to be a head coach. At least then we'll get to have a few years of seeing if he can reach a new plateau that Zimmer couldn't reach. Because if you ask me, Zimmer has plateaued. There are clearly too many coaches around the league who are better than him.

As an aside, I have seen over time on this sub that there is a reflex to always believe Zimmer is a very good coach, with the potential to be great. But we really have no evidence of that. We only have evidence of the opposite -- he's a good coach but not great. So why keep pretending like he'll someday be great?"

politics,feanbxa,t1_feajp9q,1578950531.0,"My whole point is that it's possible you and your dad are inventing a causal explanation for something that, in fact, has an entirely different cause.

Yes, Democrats have had troubles for the past 20 plus years in down-ballot races, but it's not just automatically true and obvious  that this has happened because Democrats are doing something wrong. I'm suggesting that because these structural forces are entirely out of their hands, there is a strong causal effect that they are facing from the changing distribution of voters across states and urban/rural areas. That means, essentially, that they have an immediate disadvantage (or to put it another way, Republicans have a head start in every race). This could be the entire explanation for why Democrats have done worse than Republicans over the past 20 plus years.

So I'm saying: be careful not to just accept whatever explanation in politics fits what you want to be true. I'm also not saying that this is the whole cause of the problem or that I think Democrats have made all of the right decisions in strategizing about down ballot races. But it's simply wrong to conclude what you've concluded without accounting for other factors."

For instance, there is the fact that the entire makeup of American democracy increasingly favors conservatives. As more and more people gravitate to certain large cities and certain states, you have all kinds of states where increasingly there is an advantage for Republicans in the Senate and in the Electoral College simply because there are a greater and greater proportion of people in some states who are classified as rural. Republicans can literally win a majority in the Senate with like 20 or 30% of the electorate and they have a huge advantage too in presidential elections.

So this is just an obvious advantage for Republicans over Democrats. But instead of blaming these obvious structural challenges, you blame Democrats simply because it fits your narrative that Democrats are terrible and Bernie is the savior.

His other policies on things like immigration are just for show -- Republicans have convinced their supporters (falsely) that Mexican immigrants are a huge part of our economic problems so he needs to be a dick on that. And with his tariffs, he's just fucking up our long term trade prospects while not doing anything. And again, he's doing this because Republicans have the Senate locked up (which happens, by the way, mostly because Republican have a massive demographic advantage where they can win a bunch of senate seats in red states and carry the senate with like 30% of the country actually voting for those assholes).

You Bernie people have all made up your minds that the Democratic party has fucked things up and so we need Bernie to solve things. But the real problem is the impossible demographics of the country, the massive advantages Republicans have, and their subsequent ability to just block Democratic policies. So you guys blame Obama and other Democrats for being too moderate, failing to understand that so much of his agenda was just stonewalled. And now your solution is to go *even further left* and only support someone who has essentially vowed to just try to blow up the system. It's eerily similar to the logic people used to vote for Trump: ""well, everyone else has fucked up, so let's vote for this wildcard."" Bernie is a much better person than Trump, obviously, but I see similar extreme division in the country and a future of no political cooperation, no progress on anything.

I mean you and your other Bernie supporters express zero desire or willingness to compromise and cooperate with moderate Democrats on anything. You openly express that you don't want to cooperate, that you think all moderates are feckless scum. And I'm supposed to think you're going to build a coalition and win Congress and get his agenda passed? Bernie's supporters are literally demonstrating with the way you talk about him and the way you talk about other candidates that you won't be cooperative, that you don't understand why politics always involves compromise (because the alternative is getting nothing done).

The response to what I'm saying is predictably ""you are the problem. This is why we don't get progressive policies passed."" Which totally ignores that I want those policies and I'm only explaining that there are tens of millions of moderate people who you're going to have to meet halfway if you want to get anything done. And by the time you meet them halfway, your ideas and goals are watered down. It's just what always happens. It is reality.

How is that a strategy? That is not a strategy. That is just a nebulous thing you hope will be enough to address the problem.

And so even though you don't see it, what you are saying sounds like you think it's magic, because you're rejecting some common things that happen when you have a candidate who tries to go so far in one direction, away from the mainstream, and work outside the confines of the existing system and dismantle it.

I will fully acknowledge here that I am using speculation and political logic and I do not know what will happen. Maybe Bernie can win and win Congress too. But him and ""the squad"" are among a small group of national politicians who are as progressive as him. And he refuses to even join the Democratic Party. He has never shown a desire to strongly work with other politicians on important issues. 

I will applaud you for at least acknoweldging that yes, we need the Senate to flip (so many Bernie supporters seem to not even be considering what will happen in Congress if he wins). But still, I wish people like you would show a bit more modesty about your predictions too and present them as hopes that you aren't sure about. I don't get the whole ""i'm putting all of my eggs in the Bernie basket"" attitude. Everyone who supports Bernie should at the very least see Warren as a great next choice. The fact that they don't makes me very skeptical of where their support even comes from (it makes me think many of them don't really know anything about politics).

Having said all of that, if he wins the nomination, I genuinely would support him and hope things work out. But since we aren't there yet, I'm going to keep pushing for Warren, who I think wants to do everything that Bernie wants but she has more political capital in the Democratic Party and I think she's more likely to build a coalition -- based on her record of working with her peers on major policy, based on attracting both progressives and moderates, and so on.

Now, I wouldn't actually be totally against this...if I thought it as possible, if I thought he has realistic plans to make it happen, if I thought he could get the cooperation he needs to enact his policies. But my concern is that (A) his candidacy will cause voters to swing the other way in many places and Democrats will lose Congress, and (B) even many of the existing Democrats in Congress will refuse to go along with some of his more progressive policies.

Warren, I think, would be much better at building coalitions, cooperation, making people optimistic for Democrats being in charge. And with her, I think we'd see more people voting for Democrats in every race.

So I just don't think Bernie's voters are properly consider that, even if he wins, he may have extreme difficulty getting anything done. They just think hes going to have a magical effect on politics and everything he wants he will get. Or, if you really push them, they say ""I don't care if he gets nothing done, because it can't be worse than what else we would have."" They have built a cult around him and can't see how another candidate would be more effective at getting support and a coalition that would make real change happen."

Having said that, you've pinpointed something that I think a lot of Republican voters would or should find shocking. Specifically, most Republican voters think that they have honest differences with Democratic voters, that Republicans support Republican policies because those policies are good for Republican voters (and maybe they even believe those policies are better for the country than Democratic policies).

But the reality, as you have discovered, is that Republican policies do not help most people. The middle class people (and even upper middle class people) voting for those policies are just voting for things that they think are good for them, not having enough time or expertise to see how bad Republican policies are for most people.

To a large extent, I think what happens is they hear what the most liberal of people say about what they want, like really leftist things like socialized medicine, more LGBTQ rights, basically lots of progressive economic and social policies. And then those Republican voters say ""well, I'm much different than those people, so I can't vote for who they vote for.""

Except the irony is that most of the Democrats winning elections and making policy are much more moderate than the most liberal of voters. And those Democratic policies are better for almost everyone in American -- everyone except for maybe the top 10% of income earners.

But nope, Republicans have seemanaged to divide us into two nearly equal-sized groups and the independent voters fluctuate every few years so that Republicans and Democrats win a similar number of elections. And because Republican policy is so much further right than Democratic policy, the overall policies we get are always to the right of center and most of us lose."

3) Bernie likes Elizabeth Warren -- likes her politics, likes her as a person. But he does not want Elizabeth Warren to be president.

4) Elizabeth Warren knows that Bernie wants to be president.

So when we establish all of that, when Bernie says to Warren ""well, I think Trump will weaponize misogyny,"" that's something she knows and so she's thinking ""why is he saying this to me? Well, I know he wants to win the nomination, so well, I don't think it's a stretch to think that what he's really saying is a man has a better chance to beat Trump than a woman.""

Which is not really much different than him saying ""I don't think a woman can win,"" or at least ""I'm worried that a woman can't win."" i think that's how she took what he said, and I think it was reasonable for her to take it like that.

politics,fep1rw8,t1_fenr5u3,1579310211.0,"I think the explanation is more pathetic than putting up blinders.

They like Trump and they think his policies are good for them (for most of them, this isn't actually true, but that's a separate conversation).

Information is utilitarian -- all of it either hurts their cause to keep Trump as president or it helps their cause. So because the end they desire is for Trump to be president, they seek for information that serves that end. All other information is unhelpful to that end goal. So that information is simply discarded or ignored.

For them, there is no reason to consider difference in the seriousness of information (and by the way, let's not forget that the information we're talking about is actually things that people have done -- sometimes very harmful things that have hurt people). But let's say, for example, that Trump is engaged in rampant conspiracy (because he is), like doing nothing about the murder of a US journalist in the Saudi Embassy, or Trump killing the Iranian General without informing Congress, or kids in cages, or refusing to assist Puerto Rico, and so much more, or that his daughter her husband are working in jobs in the White House that they are totally unqualified to do.

And then let's also acknowledge that it's sadly kind of normal but shitty that Hunter Biden got overpaid a ton of money working for some Ukrainian company -- and that he got that position partly because he was the US Vice President's son. He was probably more qualified for that job than Ivanka was to be a White House senior advisor, by the way, but whatever.

So I don't even think the ""blinders"" explanation properly conveys the craziness of the obvious hypocrisy. It's not even a consideration ever for a second to think about how the corruption by Trump is on a magnitude much greater than anything Democrats are doing or have done. It's just a crazy extreme asymmetry in the hypocrisy -- like, the assymetry is so extreme that it hypothetically justifies just ignoring Democratic corruption and talking all day about the insane corruption by Republicans.

But nope, the conversation we often have is ""well, Republicans are corrupt but so are Democrats."" It's so mindbogglingly stupid, I can't even think about it without getting frustrated."

A second possibility is that given that all of the guys on that page have coats on, it looks to me like they have basically pulled the ""thin"" end of the tie down lower than normal and purposely tied the knot with the wider part of the tie closer to the top.

The best classic knot to tie is called a Windsor knot. It's superior to the most popular and slightly easier knot, which is called [the Four in Hand knot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&v=9BMhFmNzw-o&feature=emb_logo).

Yes, the Four in Hand knot will work, but it sucks. The basic problem with the Four in Hand knot is that it does not produce the kind of symmetric knot you want (the knot comes out crooked). And so the ""why"" of why you should use the Windsor knot is that you want the knot to come out in the shape of an upside down triangle.

So you know when you put a tie around your neck, there's two sides. And so you know that in order to produce that upside down triangle knot, you'll need to create a bit of bulk on each side, which is why -- after you put one side over the other side of the tie -- you need to wrap the tie under and through one side and then under and through the other side. Now you've created the bulk for each side of your upside down triangle, and then it's just wrapping it over to create the face of the triangle and then under and through the face and down.

Further, Zimmer has done this with great ownership who are willing to spend whatever is necessary to get better. Green didn't have that and neither did any coach who worked with previous owners. The Wilfs put up big money for players and coaching talent and all of that money helps to cover for Zimmer's shortcomings, making it seem like he's a better coach than he is.

I think it's a lot more than just Belicheck and Pederson who are better than Zimmer. Andy Reid is one. Also Tomlin, Arians, Carroll. Then there's guys who show the potential to be better, like Shanahan, LaFleur, McVay, and arguably some others.

Further, it's important to note that only 6 coaches have been head coach for their current team longer than Zimmer. So even if some guys with a few years or less are maybe not going to be better than him, they are still in the process of proving how good they can be. Zimmer has had 6 years and they've plateaued.

It is clear that Zimmer is not among the elite coaches. I think to be considered an elite coach, in six years you should at least once be competitive in a league championship game. But the best the Vikings have done is barely beat New Orleans in 2017 (when New Orleans was a lower seed in that game, and the Vikings blew a 17-0 lead to let NO take the lead). Then they got blown out by Philadelphia in the NFC championship.

I've seen enough. Bring in a guy who hasn't gotten a chance yet to be a head coach. At least then we'll get to have a few years of seeing if he can reach a new plateau that Zimmer couldn't reach. Because if you ask me, Zimmer has plateaued. There are clearly too many coaches around the league who are better than him.

As an aside, I have seen over time on this sub that there is a reflex to always believe Zimmer is a very good coach, with the potential to be great. But we really have no evidence of that. We only have evidence of the opposite -- he's a good coach but not great. So why keep pretending like he'll someday be great?"

For instance, there is the fact that the entire makeup of American democracy increasingly favors conservatives.

Republicans can literally win a majority in the Senate with like 20 or 30% of the electorate and they have a huge advantage too in presidential elections.

Of all of the videos from this montage, the Florio/Simms one was actually the only one I saw. And yet when I clicked on OP's link, this is the one I thought I was going to see.

Why? Because both Florio and Simms ***ALSO*** said ""Saints by 17."""

I will just add that you might have data showing that other teachers at your school have seen similar declines, which would be proof that you have not gotten worse at all but rather, the situation for your students has gotten worse for some reason (perhaps their family situation or some other thing out of your control)."

If they were actually alive, it would cause mass embarrassment and criminal action against those officials who confirmed it (not to mention it would end their careers). Sure, money can buy a lot, but it's just not rational to think Epstein is alive based on all of the people whose lives would be ruined for having confirmed his death.

If people are going to push conspiracies about Epstein, if anything it should be about questions like why wasn't he being watched more carefully? Why wasn't there a much stronger than usual suicide watch for him? And *maybe* you could question if he was strangled or something, although that just seems insane to think that could happen inside a prison with so many cameras everywhere."

Every fucking person knows the FBI has done some shitty things over the years, but then so has every important institution that has ever had a positive impact on the nation. The fact of the matter is that they sometimes catch terrible people doing terrible things. You also haven't cited anything they've done for the past 25 years or so, so you're mostly talking about people who aren't even in the FBI anymore anyway.

But I'm not really praising the FBI. I'm saying they are very necessary. Unless you think maybe the Boy Scouts could do the job instead? Or perhaps some fantasy organization you've created in your head where everyone is good and perfect and there's no chance for corruption?"

It's funny how the Bernie or bust people, supporting this candidate who promotes unifying the country, seem to so often reject cooperation and unity with anyone else. Maybe that's not you in particular but it sure seems like so many Bernie supporters refuse the idea of supporting anybody else.

I'll gladly vote for Bernie Sanders if he wins the nomination. But from a political analysis point of view, I see a massive pushback by conservatives and moderates against his plans. If he wins, I hope I am wrong. But to me, Warren has a better chance of getting everything Bernie wants and securing a strong coalition that's built to last."

I think it's a mistake and it's sad.

Personally, I think the thing they dislike about her -- that she's not as uncompromising as Bernie -- is the thing that would make her a better president. I think she'd have more success not only getting things done but also generating future support in the form of bringing voters together, winning Congress in future elections, and building strong progressive policies. I think Bernie is likely to cause Democrats to lose Congress in future elections and to be unable to get much of his ideas implemented. And then, if he wins, is he actually going to run for president at age 83? Yikes."
