aww,fe2xlb6,t3_enlafg,1578844027.0,When I was a kid my family and I travel to Wisconsin to see my mom’s friendWe went to a zoo whether it was the Wisconsin’s or not I don’t remember. My favorite animal as a kid was a koala bear besides dogs and the zoo was having problems with the eucalyptus tree producing leaves for them to eat so they had to ship the koala bears off to another zoo before I got to see them I’ve still yet to see a koala bear person and I feel so bad for the everything that is happening in Australia.
