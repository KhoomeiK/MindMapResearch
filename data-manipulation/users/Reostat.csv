dogswithjobs,fft9age,t1_fft6zus,1580213123.0,"Well to me, it's more likely this was staged than someone was laughing so hard that their dog fetched an inhaler out of their bag, brought it over, and stayed while they stopped laughing to take out their phone and snap a picture in portrait mode. Edit: possibly not even portrait mode but with a camera with a wide aperture because there isn't much artifact blurring issues with the fur that is usually there with phones trying to do depth of field."

canada,ffkl0vd,t1_ffj8z1y,1580024517.0,"Ya...I've got unlimited calling and texting (but no one uses that) to the EU, plus 20gb data (also across the EU) for €17/month. I can go to unlimited data for €4 more. 

Whenever I roam out of the EU I get a message (below) about costs and little bundles. When I was in Canada it was probably the worst/biggest joke I've seen how expensive it was. Usually I just buy a couple GB if it's a short trip rather than dealing with a SIM purchase, but this was a joke. Why can you even buy less than 1gb?

If you take it less calories than you expend, you will lose weight. You can't create energy out of nothing. Insulin control is what I would put in that last 1% of ""what is important to know about weight loss"", but doesn't really matter for 99% of the overweight population. Fasting is just a round about way of eating less.

I swam into a cave in ZA where you had to time it because the wave sets would get you dangerously close to the roof of the entrance. Coming out was hard because of the current, and the worry about the next set of waves.

I never even considered the rising tide, or having to potentially dive through the water to get out (the entrance was probably 10m long, so diving under that against the current would have been hard). 

Just another thing to terrify the shit out of me and remind me how dangerous water is..."
