AmItheAsshole,fdupza8,t3_en0zfr,1578737077.0,"NTA. This might have been a little harsh if she was really ashamed about it but the fact that she was saying it was no big deal shows that she doesn't intend to change her behavior and that puts not only hers but other people at risk. It's a tough position especially with your ex-wife at odds with you, but it's an important lesson to learn. I knew about a guy in high school who got pulled over with a BAC of 0.05 and had his license suspended for three days, his parents planned to ground him for 2 months but buckled after one week and that very weekend he had a head on collision that killed 7 people. Someone who was at the party he was leaving I asked him if he was okay to drive and he said ""what are the odds i'm going to get pulled over twice in 2 weeks?"""

Wish I could say her life fell apart after that but recently heard through a friend that she just got engaged to that guy. Not upset although wish she had broken up with me more humanely, my only regret was not breaking up with her when I found out we were moving 4300 kilometres apart. Live and learn, right?"

If I were you I'd stick to my guns and not apologize for asking her to buy a new one, however you can't force her to buy you a new one and even if you could it seems the real value of this ukulele was that you had it for 10 years and there's no replacing that. So my advice is buy a new one yourself and never loan your sister anything ever again and if she complains use this is an example. That's all you really can do."
AmItheAsshole,fdn1n3s,t3_elz6su,1578574544.0,NTA. Why can't she give some of her share to her daughters? She clearly doesn't feel like you should get less then her if she expects you to Fork over part of your share to take care of her daughters. If anything if she wanted her daughters to be included she would have suggested that you both give an equal percentage and even that would be presumptuous.
