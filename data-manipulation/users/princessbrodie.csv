TooAfraidToAsk,ffl9rn3,t3_eu1eea,1580036848.0,"I have a really good imagination and can ‘visualise’ things really easy. I can ‘see’ images, motion, exact detail etc. For example if you told me to think about my dream car, I could see it as though as I was standing in front of it, then see myself driving it etc. I also have extremely vivid dreams, not sure if that’s related?"

morbidquestions,ffkxu7i,t3_eu3t28,1580030929.0,"It’s very easy to poison someone. It’s getting away with it that’s the hard part. You can buy the substance from any hardware shop, a chemist or online (easiest to be traced this way but). Lace their food or drink with the substance. Don’t google it on your computer. But that’s not how I would do it."

NoStupidQuestions,ffjko5m,t3_ets2je,1580000417.0,"I always complained when I was younger that I couldn’t see, and just thought it was normal and this must be how everyone was. I was 23 before I had my first vision test (this is in Australia- I have no idea why I never got tested earlier). Where I found out I am very short sighted, and needed glasses. It was life changing. The day I picked my glasses up I suddenly could SEE. I have no idea how I passed my drivers license test 5 years prior as legally I need my glasses to drive. Anyone reading this- please get your kids eyes checked when they are young (or your own if you never have)."
