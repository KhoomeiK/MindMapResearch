Justfuckmyshitup,fewlt9v,t1_fetzxb8,1579413957.0,I’m confused. They all look like the same person just with different hair. Are they multiple people? If so who are they?
AskReddit,fevkk3p,t3_eqies2,1579398489.0,When I was in high school I had to stay late for colorguard/marching band practice. I was driving some friends home from practice down a 4 lane Highway in our area and it was fairly dark with no lights along the road. Going 60mph and all of a sudden all 4 of us saw a woman walk right in front of my car from the side of the road. I locked up the brakes on my car and when we stopped there was no one there. I never hit anything and the woman was just.. gone. Creeps me out to this day.
AskReddit,fevjzzn,t1_fetsulp,1579398276.0,I had a similar thing happen to me when I was about that age. I was staying the night at a friends house and they swear I was asleep but I was able to tell them what we watched on tv and what was talked about and I felt kind of like I just spaced out for a minute but they said I was out a few hours.
aww,fevimez,t1_fevdj4i,1579397838.0,Cats can pant after they’ve been playing really hard as well. Panting is not always a bad thing
aww,fevhjzq,t1_fevg63h,1579397542.0,If you get the cat playing hard enough they pant too.  Jackson galaxy actually recommends playing til they pant so you know they are getting their energy out.
whatsthisbug,fejv1ls,t1_fejdaor,1579186502.0,Ugh eww. Well good thing I was careful with removing it from my house. Thanks!
whatsthisbug,feh4x1t,t1_fegm86o,1579109216.0,And do I have to worry about this thing reproducing inside my house?
whatsthisbug,feh4kgk,t1_fegm86o,1579109009.0,Yeah it was curled up a little bit seemed on the brink of death. The thorax is rounded not flat. Dunno if that helps.
aww,fdger76,t1_fdgdpwf,1578393369.0,I wonder if that’s a trait?  I have a boy cat as well but he’s not a Manx and he has never trilled ever. And when she sees another animal outside she screams so loud and viciously that’s once I woke up thinking there was a mountain lion in my house.
aww,fdfbypc,t1_fdf4vd8,1578358093.0,[this one is mine!](https://www.reddit.com/r/catswhotrill/comments/ddsopj/marley_is_the_queen_of_trills/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
aww,fdey9o8,t1_fdeusq3,1578349157.0,Mine has a nub and twitches when irritated too. It’s so cute!

Zoomies,fdbtsch,t1_fdarb6f,1578261987.0,You do realize that spaying a female dog is performing a hysterectomy and its totally invasive and that’s the only way to keep a female dog from reproducing. I mean you have to have known that right?  So are you for that or against it?  Or are you just against taking a male dogs balls?
Zoomies,fdbtg5z,t1_fdav953,1578261781.0,"Pyometra I’m female dogs is basically an eventuality if they are not fixed. Female dogs don’t have periods like humans and they don’t shed their uterine lining when they don’t get pregnant. That lining builds up every time they go into heat and don’t get pregnant until it can’t build up anymore and causes an infection. Which can put them in danger of sepsis and losing their life. Ask any vet and they’ll confirm this. 

And if we’re comparing humans and animals there yes I can tell you there are absolutely people that chose to get things removed from their bodies to keep from getting certain ailments. There are women can test for the BRCA gene to see if they are susceptible to ovarian am cancer and do choose to remove their ovaries. 

Tested and a uterus are not essential to anyone’s being. You do not need either of those things to survive in life. To reproduce yes. But if someone didn’t have them that does not me they’re going to die. So totally non essential."
Zoomies,fdag1bv,t1_fdaammm,1578245611.0,"Inversely not spaying and neutering can cause issues too. Males who aren’t neutered are more prone to cancer that will spread more rapidly with testosterone in their system and females who aren’t spayed are likely to get something called Pyometra which means their uterus gets infected with pus and causes other health issues. 

There are definitely more benefits to their health when they are fixed than when they are not."
Zoomies,fdaexx7,t3_ekc64l,1578245295.0,I give my dog pig ears but I get them from the butcher and they’re smoked and still have a bunch of the fat and meat in them too from the head. He loves them.
cats,fcx7ciz,t1_fcwujcy,1578054192.0,Just when I think I’ve joined all the cat subs
cats,fcx78ni,t1_fcwkpjw,1578054074.0,Skunks can actually be a pretty cool pet or household animal. Just don’t get a bird. They will eat it.
cats,fcx76um,t1_fcw6mjh,1578054018.0,My eyes are just fine and I still thought it was a skunk
gifs,fcx6gs1,t1_fcwftay,1578053201.0,They totally are. Minus the crazy missing teeth. They would definitely have to wear their flippers for me to not stare at holes in their mouths the whole time.
