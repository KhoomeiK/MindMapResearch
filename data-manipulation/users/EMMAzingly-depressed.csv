dogs,fct2uyg,t3_eiea07,1577931439.0,Some people are raised believing that it is “training.” And then they get a dog and don’t do proper research on how to train or what to do so they continue. But 9 times out of 10 they are shit people with anger issues!
dogs,fcszax2,t3_eiqm7a,1577928862.0,"I think that your responsible enough to realize when your care is failing short which is good, but ultimately it’s not ideal getting rid/rehoming your dog. I think if you try to manage your time and it’s still not working out you have no choice. I don’t know, however, where to reach out for a new home.  DONT USE CRAGSLIST. Try to find someone you somewhat know so you can insure a good home and maybe even check in."

dogs,fcirmtx,t1_fcir5g5,1577668183.0,The situation is difficult because she lives in a small town and is friends with animal control services. My mom has had many y’all with her about her treatment forward her dogs. Sadly that is all we can do. I talked to my mom about convincing her to fix her dog. We will see how it goes.
dogs,fcikswt,t3_ehdfiw,1577664220.0,She just forgets her dogs in there it’s horrible. And the worst part is she is going to breed her soon and become a byb for money. She even admits it’s for money.
dogs,fciis75,t3_ehdfiw,1577663242.0,"Ok, but why am I in the same predicament. My cousin impulsively got a pure breed Great Dane. She hits her dog when the dog is “bad” and leaves it in a cage for 12 hours that IS NOT big enough.....I hate it"
