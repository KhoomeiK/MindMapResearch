When I start being hard on myself my husband gently reminds me that I don’t have to beat myself up, I have a job that does that for me.  So next time you start to be hard on yourself, remember that it’s not your job to be hard on yourself.  My boss can do that for you.  Take care of yourself- that is your job and that is something you and I were never taught to do (and likely punished if you were caught doing that)."

It wasn’t until I was in my 40’s that I realized it was not normal to withhold basic needs such as food and doctor visits from just one child even when money is not an issue.  

When you grow up in an Nhousehold, you do not have the opportunity to learn what is normal since your normal is so warped.  

So stop being so hard on yourself.  You are reacting as a normal person in an abnormal environment.  Internet hugs to you."

My Ndad liked to play the martyr dad, poor widower who had to care for two daughters after his wife died of cancer.  He got lots of sympathy from his friends.  He never cared for me, I was basically made to fill in the void left by mom’s death and do the cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping so my older sister, the GC, could continue to have a carefree childhood.  Ndad has from time to time made comments about mom was the one that wanted kids, but has never been as direct as your dad.  

Even with my life experience and my own Ndad it continues to amaze me how many parents blame their children for being born.  Like it was our idea and we just burst our ways into our mothers’ bodies, and our poor, innocent fathers could only stand by and watch it happen..."

One of my colleagues at work lost his wife to cancer and his 18 year old daughter was coming home from college for the weekend.  He commented that he had to make her dinner so she would still feel like she was cared for.  That totally crushed me because when I was 14 and my mom died, my dad looked to me to do all the cooking and cleanup and it was very clear to me I was no longer able to look to adults to care for me.  That part of my life was done.  The fact that the man at work realized that an 18 year old still needed to know she was loved, supported, and cared for really floored me.  My dad’s only concern when my mom died was who was going to take care of HIM, and perhaps a bit of who would care for my older sister who has always been his favorite.  

Mourning the fact that you did not have decent parenting as a child is part of getting through being a child of the self-absorbed.  It is part of the healing process.

Good luck on your recovery and your feelings are yours.  You cannot emote incorrectly, as Nparents claim you are doing.  Keep reading, cry when you need to, and have a long and narc-free life."

It issued you, it is the fact that you were not taught basic life skills.  The therapist sounds like they broke patient confidentiality and you suffered for it.  Is there someone at school you can talk to?  Nparents make us seem crazy to others, they make up lies to make themselves sound like martyrs.  If you end up in any court hearing about guardianship, you have to act the part of a put together young adult.  Anything less makes the Nparent seem like they are telling truth.  After that, a good therapist can help you put the pieces back together.  Good luck to you."

Controlling your outside social contacts is a big red flag for domestic violinist/ abuse too.

At least I was a teen before cell phones and email, so Ndad couldn’t monitor those."

People should just let the childless be, don’t judge, shame, or pity us.  We each have our own reasons, weather by choice or just ran to the end of medical help and the ability to pay for it.

raisedbynarcissists,fdsbqgg,t1_fdsbcbs,1578698949.0,"I have to say nope on that one.  Your sister is THEIR child, not yours.  If you are in the US, move to a state that does not have filial support.  Some states will compel you to pay for your elderly parents’ care.  I wish I could give my Ndad the same level of care he gave me as a minor and a dependent... that is, scream verbal and emotional abuse at him for needing medical care (and not providing that needed care), tell him he is too fat to need food, tell him he is too fat and ugly to deserve new clothes....  Admittedly, none of us would be that cruel, but it is a nice fantasy to see how an Nparent would like to receive the same lack of care they gave us."
raisedbynarcissists,fdq8mqv,t3_empirh,1578659350.0,"I am also noting that you are looking how you can fix this, just like the other comment or so far.  That is very typical of the narc family dynamic, you are assigned blame for essentially nothing.  Sleeping till ten should not be offensive, however, that is a very common narc parent trait (my Ndad screamed if I slept past 7 as a teenager on weekends).  If you can go back to college early, that might be a good place.  Then they can find their own child care for the 4 year old.  

As you get older and gain your own independence, which will happen when you have your own job, be alert for the other narc parent abuses.  They may demand money, tell you that they actually own your entire salary, try to undermine your job search, try to limit what jobs you can apply for or where you can live, take credit for all your success in life, and continue to expect you to do all the housework in their house even after you move out.  Be sure to always keep separate bank accounts and if your security questions are things they would know, create alternate security questions or answers.  

Congrats on your fantastic grades, you will do very well for yourself in life.  Remember, you cannot fix your parents and it is not your responsibility to do so.  I am sorry you have to deal with nparents, none of us would have chosen them if we had an option.  Good luck to you in life."

raisedbynarcissists,fdjnad4,t3_elqx6s,1578479195.0,"I can relate so much to everything you said.  One thing that helped me is that my husband saw how my father treats me when he thinks no one else is around.  So my husband is very supportive and helps me when he sees me struggling to express needs.  I was taught that I was bad when I had needs, such as needing to go to the doctor.  My sister was allowed to go when she needed to, but not me.  

One thing to watch for as you get older is fiscal abuse.  My Ndad has stolen money from me, and feels entitled to everything I own.  Also, the less you tell your family, the better.  “Gray rocking” gives them less ammunition to ridicule you with.  

Good luck, and know that you are not incapable and you deserve a good life."
