skeptic,fffazre,t1_fff5hxw,1579879978.0,"Like I said, he's definitely guilty in my eyes. Never said whether the bidens are guilty matters. Didn't mean to imply it does, but I'll edit to clarify anyway.

This whole thing isn't happening in a vacuum though. The problem a lot of people on the right have is the perception that when trying to separate the two instances of wrongdoing, it appears to be suppression of one side and magnification of the others. While I understand that is not the reality, that doesn't matter since they are only seeing the discussion be shifted from Biden and onto Trump. I agree with the separation, but I'd also like to see a separate investigation happen above board and not through the abuse of an official position for personal gain. If there was in fact corruption on the part of the bidens, the American people deserve to know.

worldnews,fe5azim,t1_fe50059,1578867201.0,"I was going to put this bit at the end, but decided to cut and front load it.  I largely agree with your attributions, but feel it is important to distinguish between social and economic spectrums and to include the authority side of things.  I'm socially left, but economically right and libertarian. I've been called a socialist and a fascist in the same day because those two ideas are being combined. So a bit of this is somewhat personal. I also probably made a mistake or two. It's been a while since I've been formally educated on this and it's not entirely my field (history is my thing, not pol sci if you're curious.) That said, I've been told I can be abrasive and come off the wrong way. So, if it seems like I'm being a dick or condescending, that is by no means intentional and I apologize.

Alright. Going to go down the list you put for each then. First, going to identify the major issue I see.  Economic, social, and authoritarian spectrums are separate and independent. It's possible to have a socially left/economically right, or economically left/socially right government and either can be a dictatorship or democracy.  There is no attachment between authoritarianism and economic or social ideology.  You can have two communist countries and one is democratic while the other is a dictatorship. 

So that addresses the democratic and authoritarian attributions to ""left/right."" Next would be addressing exactly what is meant by ""left/right."" Typically those refer to economic and social policies. Economic left being communism, right being capitalism. Social left being progressive, right being conservative. Again, there can be combinations of those.  You attribute various acts of bigotry to the right and that's correct so long as you're specifying social right. The Soviet Union banned homosexuality, but was ""the left"" for nearly a century. economic right, democratic countries also had bigoted policies.

Now for your lists, going in order(mostly, combining likes):

For the Right:

* Authoritarian: Addressed in first paragraph, neither left nor right.
* Religious: Socially right, though more common in more authoritarian ideals. if not a religious institution, then a cult of personality (DPRK is secular, but cult-like following of dictator)
* Punishment: Aspect more of authoritarian regimes, though typically seen on socially right
* Corporatism: Economic right (slightly increased authority)
* Plutocratic: Authoritarian economic right
* ANTI-INTELLECTUAL: Against Education/Against Scientific Funding: Aspect of authoritarianism more than economic and social policy. 
* BIGOTRY: Minority-Blaming, Xenophobic, Homophobic, Transphobic, Pro-Segregation: Social right, typically, though as mentioned above, neither left nor right.
* Nationalist: Neither left nor right, typically common with more authoritarian regimes.
* Isolationist: Neither left nor right, typically common with more authoritarian regimes.
* Profit First: economic right.

&#x200B;

For the Left:

* Democratic:  Addressed in first paragraph, neither left nor right.
* Secular: typically socially left, though typically more common in more libertarian ideals. Constitution of US dictates secular gov't (admittedly debatable in practice. ""In God We Trust"" is on the money), but is economically right. 
* Rehabilitation Programs: Typically socially left, and more common in economically left nations with increased authority (gotta structure, fund, and enforce them somehow)
* Workers Rights: Social left
* Infrastructure Building: Neither left nor right. The Roman Empire built roads like it was their job and was socially and economically right. The US in the late 19th century is the same way.
* PRO-INTELLECTUAL: Education Promotion/Pro-Science: Aspect of authoritarianism more than economic and social policy. 
* Community Building: Unrelated to left or right or authoritarianism. Though extremely authoritarian/controlling regimes will try to limit communities since it facilitates the flow of ideas. 
* Culture Sharing: Social left.
* Trade: Happens whether socially or economically left or right. Trade is a function of states. 
* People First: Unrelated to social and economic ideal. Typically social left, but more tied to authority spectrum. i.e. authoritarian gov't will put state first, libertarian will put people first."

gaming,fcywenv,t1_fcyutly,1578088554.0,"American Civil war: old southern men get mad that old northern men say they can't have slaves. Old southern men go to war telling their young men it's to preserve states rights and that the north started it. North goss to war telling their young men it's about reunification and to end slavery. North didn't actually end slavery until a bit after the war ended. (Emancipation proclamation did very little.)

WW2: Old men claim to be superior. Tell their people they are superior and their problems are caused by external forces. They ""solve"" some of the problems, so the people start to trust them. They then start blaming their problems on ""inferior"" people within their nation. Then they start trying to reclaim lost land, triggering a war in Europe. The war escalates to include several major powers fighting in EUR and Africa. On the other side of the planet, another major power uses similar propaganda to justify rapid imperial expansion, leading it into direct conflict with the US. Sparks a war over control of Asia and the Pacific Ocean. 

Both caused by old men and led to millions of young men dying in combat. The quote is possibly paraphrasing FDR saying ""War is young men dying and old men talking"" or McGovern saying ""I'm fed up to the ears with old men dreaming up wars for young men to die in."" or a whole. List of people who said similar things in history."
