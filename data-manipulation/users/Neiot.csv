It's no deadlier than the common cold or the flu. If you are any older than 60 or if you already have a respiratory condition, you might have complications, but you are more likely to die from a bad cold than you are from the coronavirus, which is only named such for the shape of the bacteria. It's only in the news because it's a strain new to science that is in the same family of viruses which cause the common cold.

I live in the city it was first diagnosed in, besides Wuhan, China. I'm not worried. Just wash your hands and don't sneeze at people. Calm down."
