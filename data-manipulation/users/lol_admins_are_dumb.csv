The radiator is more expensive and more complicated to install and maintain, and has a bigger impact when it fails. But if you're moving into a rental home that for instance had both for some reason, and you don't have to care about maintenance or installation, you would pay a similar monthly bill regardless of which you ran"
funny,feuya2n,t1_fesys9y,1579391117.0,Your utility company will probably rebate some or all the cost of one. They are relatively cheap and very easy to install.
funny,fesi32t,t1_feshdrc,1579365339.0,"> Modern European buildings seem to have moved on to using both. Nobody builds radiators under windows anymore, instead hot water is run under the flooring of the entire living space. This water is often not even heated in the home itself, but in a central heating facility nearby, such as a refuse incineration plant.

Yeah, radiant floor heating is growing in popularity here as well. But it's seen as a luxury, you're installing two entire separate systems for hot and cold whereas forced air is one system for both. So most families don't opt for the additional cost, even though it is quite comfortable.

> Leaks don't really seem to be a huge problem, I don't personally know of anyone who suffered any major water damage from their heating system.

Regardless of frequency of event, the impact is much larger than the impact of an air leak. And water absolutely does leak, even if you haven't anecdotally heard of anybody.

> That said, I'm sure that the European system is designed to work well with European weather and building standards. I don't doubt that other regions have other requirements and circumstances where another system might make a lot more sense.

This to me is the biggest thing, and what annoys me most about these conversations. It's fine if where you live and where I live have differing requirements, but let's not make these holier than thou comparisons based on those differing requirements. Not that you personally have done this, it's just so common in these threads (like the one I responded to)"

funny,fesagyl,t1_fes8cwu,1579363233.0,"Water leaks cause way more damage than air leaks. If you get an air leak, it's an inconvenience, but if you get a water leak, that's an emergency

Radiators tend to concentrate the heat into hot spots, where as with whole-house air movement it all evens out

Also, if you're anywhere that gets both hot and cold, you're gonna need AC as well, and now you're running both for no reason. Air ducts work for both hot and cold

Also in general, ducting is simpler (which translates to cheaper labor), cheaper (in parts), and less prone to problems.

Pound for pound, you will spend more to operate a radiator/boiler system than forced air.

Lastly, forced air is instantly on. Think electric stove vs gas. Radiator-based water piping has to warm up to temperature before it's capable of warming any rooms, forced air is hot as soon as it turns on

Stopping before the install to figure out where to go from there is exactly the right move. Installing without taking the time to figure that out is exactly why it's the installers fault. If the installer correctly called out the issue ahead of time and was instructed to just install it anyway, that would not be the installer's fault. But installing it when it's clear it won't work without stopping to point out the issue is the installer's fault.

The time to find out about and come up with solutions for this problem is not after it's already been installed. Not speaking up early on in the process is your fault.
