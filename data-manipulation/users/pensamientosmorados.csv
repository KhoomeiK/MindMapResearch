The Manson family murders really shocked middle America.

UnresolvedMysteries,ffyt3ho,t1_ffyi9jl,1580354459.0,"I don’t think he’s been in detention. He was probably provisionally allowed to stay in Canada as it mentions he settled there.

He was subsequently found to be “inadmissible” to stay probably because he got in trouble with the law and was placed in detention.

At that point the Canadian government would want to prove his identity so they could deport him to his country of origin."
