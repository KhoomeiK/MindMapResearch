Monday morning here, and I'm already drunk not to feel that bad about job. Gotta go there sadly :-("

careerchange,fehyvwl,t1_fehvkps,1579126656.0,"Thank you! it's really frustrating, just as you said :-(  
I wish we succeed in changing it all and living our dreams.

It would be so cool to get rid of this constant stress and rushing of IT industry, get rid of bosses who only care abotu their personal money bonuses... By now, after exploring non-software corporate job,s I started to see only self employment, or rather small business, as a way to quit it.

You thought in this direction? Maybe you have some strengths outside of sofhtware and you don't mind trying to build some busienss on those? 

It's not easy unfortunately... wish it was, and not all strengths and passions are made equal, but maybe this is the way."

depression,fehjhon,t3_ep4bw6,1579117807.0,"Maybe. I feel so for last weeks after I contemplated suicide. Feel like dead inside - can't force myself to work, very hard to fall to sleep and to wake up, no desire and no energy to do anything, stopped caring about many things, and it only becomes worse. Like becoming some sort of shadow of a man who you were."

I have a bit better relations with father but it's only because he was absent during all my childhood (parents divorced when I was a kid, still hate each other), and he treats me like adult a bit more. He's also conservative (not socialist like mom) so with him it's easier to discuss topics like starting my own business.

Yeah, studying abroad is complicated. At least I tried it once, better than nothing."
SuicideWatch,fdrpijm,t1_fdrohee,1578687724.0,"So far I can't afford studying abroad as it's very expensive (even in countries with low tuition - as fees, textbooks, housing, food and transport are not free and your chances to work are very limited). Thank you, I researched plenty of resources, even studied abroad for a year actually few years ago. It was nice, but very expensive.

Thanks for your kind words :-) Yes, I hope it's gonna be well eventually with book. I always wanted to write history book which is interesting to read and study but which is not lacking critical points (common for ""novice level"" history books) and not looks like overloaded 500-page grimoire with neverendingly long chapters which make many bored (even me at times!)

I'll update of course, if there are news :-)"
SuicideWatch,fdrnpt5,t1_fdrllrm,1578687120.0,"It's really hard for me, escel in field which I despise so much :-( Even learning public speaking (I had inborn speech problems, have accent and naturally shy) was easier than this."

But isn't MBA is purely corporate thing? I mean, unlikely it will be helpful if you one day dream to open small business in some small Portland town.

I'm not that familiar with MBA though, so I might be very wrong. Generally - what options does it give?"
SuicideWatch,fdrkqd5,t1_fdrik88,1578685845.0,"It could be a solution, yes - but I'm relativey not that good in current field (software) so all my application attempts (2017 and 2018 years) were rejected. They are not fools too, want great specialists from abroad."
SuicideWatch,fdrkhf7,t1_fdrb119,1578685741.0,"Thank you for those suggestions! Unfortunately, none is a real option here - libraries are very underfinanced and here they don't provide tutoring services (I wonder if lack of finance is the reason), government programs for support don't exist... Maybe some onlien support groups? I'll try googling them again. It's russia, not western country, so here it's harder with options and opportunities.

Yeah, I hope I missed something. I wish I miss something as it will give some hope.

I'm working on history book, but work goes very slow and when I'm extremely low like these days, it effectively stops.

I also have history website but so far it only has testing design. I just liked domain name a lot and decided that I should try one day to use it."
SuicideWatch,fdr4jvr,t1_fdr2ur8,1578679370.0,"Thank you. I took vacation in November, and can't say it helped - it only made me even more reluctant to work here. I'm not lazy, no, but such job environments and meaninglessness (right spelling?), and corporate rat race, stupid bosses, it all makes me sick for all those years.

My hobbies are pretty much useless here, liberal arts - history as top passion, social science, cultures, religions (mainly branches of christianity but I have lots of knowledge of others too), geography and so on... But no money for formal education.

However, if we talk about hobbies and strengths, I will mention that I'm amazing historian even without degree. I lectured a bit for free on history subjects, and every person who knwos me well will confirm my knowledge and my ability to teach and explain history so it's interesting and not like in school textbooks.

I tried to find any opportunities to use it, maybe to teach online somehow but the demand is ridiculously small :-("

Career that:

1. Allows me to be my own boss.
2. Connected to history field (history is my top hobby, especially military and political, but social too).
3. Doesn't require additional degree which I can't afford (this point rules out school and university jobs).

And no, for many reasons I had to exclude tour guide as an option - no money in this field here, and not much to show, and many legal limitations.

Teachers,fc9xsiz,t1_fc9sh22,1577559798.0,"In my city there were even stories about 4th grade boys raping 1st grade ones, not to mention lesser crimes. I personally saw that some my classmates in 3-5 classes use ballons of lighter gas or some ordinary glue (neither requires ID to buy) to get high with it, and then started to do crazy and dangerous stuff. Same peopel were drinking vodka during classes in 7th grade.

Fortunately I never got involved with any of those, but the point is - even childred in 3rd-4th grades can be criminals, and can be dangerous for the society. Do they need help? Maybe, but practice shows that it rarely works - a relative of mine works in child mental hospital, and what she says about the overall situation and statistics, is terrible.

I don't see real solutions for the problem now."
Teachers,fc9wuir,t3_egt32f,1577559377.0,"Such kids, who disobey teachers, are usually only distracting other kids who want to study, from learning anything. In my country the fact that teacher effectively cannot do anything with disobeying kid lead already to the point that with only school knowledge it's jsut impossible to pass exams into any college, additiolan private lessons are required - so universal school system had obviously failed to give even basic knowledge. Now Cali comes on this way too."

careerchange,fc2vo4w,t1_fc2tzp7,1577375276.0,From my experience (lots of job interviews) they often ask follow up questions about why wasn't it a good fit. So there's need for some answer

I remember Saudi Arabia once built a whole camp town for Syrian refugees - who instead preferred to go to UK and US. Thing is, if one is seeking asylum for being afraid to be killed, they shouldn't use it as an excuse to raise their financial status in the meantime. Is there civil war in Mexico or Canada? No? Then America doesn't have any source of refugees, only a source of those who want to live prosperous life.

For perspective, I'm a guy who tries to legally immigrate to the US from shithole country, and it's a hard mission, illegals have it much more easy."
