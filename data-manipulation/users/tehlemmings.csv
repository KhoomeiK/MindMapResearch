Okay, I have to say it again.  That's not how this works.  That's not how any of this works.

Filming on a green screen *does not* turn your actors into 3d objects that you can correctly cast light on.  Well, it sorta does now, but did not back then.

Or they would have done that.

>  Anyway, that was the selling point of software like v-ray which I tried for a bit while trying to expand knowledge from tv editiosn as I was doing back then (2006). I mean, calculating how a light ray would act and recreating the scattering over atmosphere until it hits with whaver obstacle you put there didn't sound impossible back then and doesn't now.

So you have a vague understanding of what ray tracing does.  But you don't seem to understand how film works.  Which makes me doubt your claim that you were an editor.  If that's what you meant, it's hard to tell because that's not how ""editiosn"" is used as a word.

> So I bought some courses from fxphd which included Nuke, Vue and 3dsmax. With the course you got access to a student license for these, which had a ray-tracing plugin called v-ray. IT was a bit more complicated than saying RTX ON, sure, and the tracing part is not ""how"" you do get CGI but a technology that existed for a long while now.

Apparently, no where in that course did they cover that you couldn't magically use those plugins on flat raw footage.

>I shit you not, it's possible to integrate computer rendered and movie footage together. /s

No.  Even now it's not possible to magically do it the way you're thinking.  In order to do it now, they're recreating the entire scene in a 3d environment to create the proper lighting.  That's not something they could reasonably do back then.  

Which is why they didn't do that."

Something [like this](https://www.mytheresa.com/euro_en/vetements-bodysuit-with-gloves-1267315.html) but without the weird stomach gap (I'm too lazy to dig more than 2 images down on google lol)

There's a weird seem on her leg that makes me think that it's a full bodysuit.  

She did a really good job blending the neckline though.  I wonder if it'd hold up to lots of movement."
