RedLetterMedia,fdsgvi4,t1_fdqkzfs,1578702488.0,"""Blue balls"" is a term for when a man gets an erection and possibly some stimulation but not to the point of ejaculation. Afterwards, if the erection subsides without ejaculation, there is sometimes some pain in his scrotum colloquially known as ""blue balls.""

Star wars episode I was ""cinematic blue balls"" in the sense that the hype surrounding the movie was so great, it was as if the country was experiencing a massive erection just at the thought of a new star wars movie. They were metaphorically getting fellatio from the sexiest slave leia you can think of. She was deepthroating the countries' massive erection with no gag reflex, staring at you in the eye, moaning, begging for your cum, while allowing you to film it in hd with 4 different camera angles. 3 of her sexiest friends joined her and they were pleasuring you in ways you didn't know were possible. And then, you went to see the movie, and the sexy slave leia turned out to be your mom, and her friends were 3 homeless guys. You were on the precipice of the greatest sexual experience of your entire life and the climax was so bad you were unable to finish, thus resulting in terrible, painful blue balls.

Somewhat of a same situation happened surrounding Episode VII. There was lots of hype, it had been 11 years since a star wars movie came out. It was going to be different because it was Disney. 

This question is asking, essentially, which trilogy had the bigger gap between pre-film hype and post-film disappointment. I was a small child for the prequels so I only experienced the blue balls from the sequels. I can only imagine what it felt like in 1999."
RedLetterMedia,fdsewt8,t1_fdqk3wn,1578701149.0,"Most of us are fans of RLM because of the Plinkett reviews, a several hours long shredding of the prequels as competent movies.

The prequels are bad movies. They can be fun for children who like flashy glow sticks. And if you were a child when they came out, they are hella nostalgic."

Nothing made any sense in any of the sequel movies. The same problems plaguing the prequels are present in the sequels. It looks prettier, that's about it. I think McDiarmid and McGregor (especially in episodes 2-3) did pretty good jobs at becoming their characters in the prequels. They are by far the 2 shining spots in a pile of bullshit. Similarly, Driver is by far and away the best actor of these new movies. And it shows even though what he is working with is crap.

I probably watched those three movies a combined 100 times. I played battlefront 2 and star wars bounty hunter on PS2 for 1000 hours combined. I was the total fanboy. I look back \*fondly\* on them. However, I now realize, thanks mainly to plinkett, that they are very terrible films. 

After watching TFA I had nostalgia for the prequels because I fucking loved them so fucking much when they came out. I wanted those same feelings but, alas, the film was trash.

Your PC goes on the run because the patron has caught wind of her defeat of the warlock changeling and sends the captain of Deeble's army after her. Deeble is the town responsible for shielding the school from the real world because it's a target for many evil people trying to either destroy or influence the future magic users of the continent. She has to go on the run and finds an underground city of dwarves who need her help. Eventually she frees the leader of the dwarves from a prison deep inside the Deeble while being confronted by the captain of the army and maybe more familiar foes.

This type of block happens all the time. Probably 10-20 times in a normal nfl game. It happens precisely because of the way the rule is written. The lineman is out front and can't see behind but the defender can see the play is over. The blockers can/will still hit you until it's abundantly clear the play is over. There is a reason why refs blow the whistle 10 times to end plays all the time. It's hey hey hey hey hey the play is over hey hey hey hey stop. As opposed to ""whistle, everything else in the ensuing 1-2 seconds is now a penalty. ""

And the line isn't on the field for the refs to see either they have to look at the markers on the sideline. It's similar to how difficult an offside call is in real time in soccer.
