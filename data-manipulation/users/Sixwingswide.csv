When I did the 1-bar sorc, I ended using bolt escape/steak to cover Distance in an instant: like the poison stage to reach the pools, final stage for all kinda of stuff. Did you find yourself sprinting a lot? Was thinking using the chains that pull you to the target."

Best of luck."

elderscrollsonline,fednmrj,t1_fedaiyo,1579015887.0,I think they could change one of the morphs on the Destructive Reach/Clench abilities to add the taunt and take it out of a passive. This way you have the option of using  an ice staff like any other destro without sacrificing passive points or disrupting group play.
