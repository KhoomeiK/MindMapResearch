Standup,ffhm1ju,t1_ffhcb7f,1579941705.0,"Can I just say. Farley was a genius. I was too young to understand some of his comedy. However, as I got older, I realized how his loud and over the top style was something that everyone could relate to.

He was our most absurd selves, all the time. He reached into the chaos and made sense of it through his work. Although his life was cut short because of this. He conquered our fears for us, and abolished the awkward line between comedy and life."
