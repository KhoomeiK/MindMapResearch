Also their license is registered as Fox, not Fox news which I thought was also illegal."
funny,ffbgjxf,t3_eshsb2,1579764323.0,The reason that everyone is saying take the cat to the vet asap is that urinary tract infections can kill make cats quickly- not to mention it's really painful.

politics,ff6mynj,t1_ff6ke4h,1579630639.0,It's still worth considering. It's not like it doesn't happen.

They both do very concise breakdowns of what's going on."

thyroidhealth,ff65apq,t1_ff2hf4h,1579619477.0,"You just have to Google it or ask around. I have to pay a yearly fee ($50/month) to access my functional + I pay the specialist copay. I have a hmo.

Generally I think functional are slightly more covered with ppo's but she's very worth it IMHO as she sorted me out.  

(I wasn't responding to the t4 only medication as most do so it was worth it for me to go to the functional and get t4/t3. Now I feel ok. )"
