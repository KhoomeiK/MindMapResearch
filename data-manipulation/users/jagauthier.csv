I don't think there's any problem with intense study of the bible.  The end times, and the book of revelations, is absolutely fascinating.

I also suspect your dad didn't read the part of the bible where Jesus said, ""Only the Father knows"" (with respect to the timing of the rapture). However, given his narcissistic tendencies, it probably doesn't apply to him.
