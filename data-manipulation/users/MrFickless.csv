aviationmaintenance,ff7p3mk,t1_ff6dfjr,1579654910.0,"Wait, you don’t have to physically separate the torque link for towing, do you? 

Isn’t the steering disconnect pin at the front of the NLG enough?"
aviationmaintenance,ff7ophd,t3_er4t3z,1579654636.0,That’ll do.
spacex,ff51yuz,t1_ff2naw5,1579578040.0,That makes sense. They simulated as if an astronaut hit the abort button right at max Q.

singapore,fcjka5u,t3_ehio4y,1577691011.0,"Higher interest but probably not as stringent credit checks as compared to banks. 

If the banks decline you a loan, you probably aren’t financially stable enough to afford the interest associated with a loan.

Legal moneylenders should only be used as a last resort. For example, medical emergencies. Even then, you should ask the hospital or clinic about your options for payment first."
educationalgifs,fcb9gel,t1_fcb6hxe,1577584091.0,"The energy to accelerate a satellite tends towards infinity as the speed approaches the speed of light. 

Just look at how much energy we need to accelerate mere protons to near light speed.

Now imagine a mass a few quintillion times larger."

educationalgifs,fcaw0tz,t1_fcat20z,1577577719.0,"This is one of the rare objects that we know exactly what would happen if it hit the earth believe it or not.

The Skylab space station was essentially the same object with the fuel tanks and rockets replaced with scientific and life support equipment.

When it reentered the atmosphere, it did so partly over Western Australia. Some parts survived and NASA got a $400 ticket for littering."

It’s a spent rocket stage from the greatest coverup of all time. Literally a hollow metal shell."
nextfuckinglevel,fcapg3q,t1_fcaofb8,1577573946.0,"The early Apollo missions to the moon up to Apollo 12 deliberately retargeted their 3rd stages to fly past the moon and out into deep space.

From Apollo 13 onwards, the S-IVBs were targeted to impact the moon to induce artificial moonquakes as there were seismometers left by Apollo 11 and 12.

They did this by venting whatever was left in the oxygen tanks. All it takes is a few m/s difference in the right direction to either hit the moon, fly around it, or slingshot into deep space.

Yes, L1 is a Lagrange point."

NASA crashed 5 of these on purpose back during the Apollo moon landings to produce artificial moonquakes."
