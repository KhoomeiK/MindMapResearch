ASU,fh8p2rv,t3_f1n7iv,1581364427.0,"So back in my first year at ASU I was close friends with a small group of people, and had a crush on one of them. We had all just watched a movie (I don't recall what it was) where a male character had done the stereotypical chloroform routine to a female character with the rag over her mouth and nose while pulling her into the shadows. My crush made a joke about it being so romantic.

After the movie we all went to the POD for snacks and, long story short, I 'chloroformed' her with an Uncrustable and dragged her into a side aisle. Fortunately, she reacted exactly the way I'd hoped she would, which was to laugh so hard she almost peed."

depression,fgt0ojc,t3_f0bl3z,1581096598.0,"I remember this same question. It used to really bother me and made me feel like I was somehow less human than other people who had energy and could do things.

Eventually I realized that I had been thinking about my depression backwards; I wasn't depressed because I had no energy, I had no energy because I was depressed.  I remember from that realization onwards I had hope, and it helped drive me to figure out how to deal with my depression and not feel like I was less than human. I am a human, but I'm a human with depression, and that means that sometimes I have no energy when I otherwise would. 

And for the record, I was right; when I'm not in a downswing I do have extra energy. I just went so long without having any that I thought I wasn't capable of it anymore."

The first trap was basically a pie on a plate that slowly creaked toward the group, then a flower popped up and squirted water at them, and there was a third harmless trap that I can't recall, but right after that one there's a pressure plate that triggers a 5x5x5 ceiling slab to fall and crush whoever's underneath it.

Sometimes job hunting is attrition; you have to keep applying because one of them is the right one where you're the right candidate at the right time. It's easy to get sucked down into the vortex, especially when everything makes you feel inferior, but just remember that tomorrow is a new opportunity to do better than today; you don't have to completely change your life in a day, but try to make something better, whether it's cleaning or applying for more jobs than you did yesterday, or exploring furthering your education.

Theatre,ff5yoii,t3_erqwov,1579614498.0,"My instinct would be either get a different actor or get a different director, but don't try to do both roles. It's not film where you can watch the shot and give yourself direction; you have to be either on stage or off, and in both cases you're doing yourself and the company a disservice by not seeing the complete picture as a director, and robbing yourself of good direction as an actor.

It honestly sounds like you should put Gloomy Gus in if it's too late to hold more auditions. Maybe frame it to him as a growth opportunity, but explain to him that you want him to be more of a leader for the ensemble because his attitude makes a difference to the cast."

pics,ff4uqb1,t1_ff4qfx2,1579572904.0,"> Don’t these kinds of rifles have a much greater rate of fire than your traditional hunting rifles though? 

Semi-automatic weapons (which is what I assume you mean by ""these kinds of rifles"") fire as fast as you the trigger is pulled. The effects of a round being discharged is what prepares the next round to be fired (the action), meaning that it happens much, much faster than a human would be able to prepare the weapon to fire again (examples of other actions are pump-action, double and single-action, and bolt-action). 

The obvious concern is that unskilled users would be able to create a large volume of gunfire in a short amount of time. This is something that scares me most about these weapons, and one of the reasons why high-capacity, or even anything other than low-capacity magazines are illegal to own in many places. It is worth noting that while the theoretical maximum rate of fire is comparable to an automatic weapon (by using a bump stock, for example), it would be difficult for even a trained shooter to maintain effective accuracy at a rate of fire higher than around 40rpm. That being said, in examples like Vegas where the murderer was shooting into a crowd, accuracy may be a secondary concern to volume. 

In general I am against owning semi-automatic weapons without strict licensing, insurance, and extensive background checks."

I actually brought that exact point up to my partner and she gave me some context on it that I hadn't considered; neither of us could recall Yen outright stating that she wants a child (we might be mistaken). What makes more sense with Yen's character is that she wants the power of choice; she wants to be able to choose to have a child, even if she doesn't immediately have cone.
