When I was 7, in the mid 80s, I was sitting in the car in Santa Monica with 2 friends while my dad ran into a liquor store. A woman came up to our car, and started yelling at us. The three of us rolled up the windows faster than we ever had in our lives as she targeted us. I don't remember why she was yelling at us, but she concluded with, ""Stay in school, kids, so you don't end up like me!"" She then pulled back her lips to show how many teeth were missing. She staggered away while our screams shook the car.   

We were still screaming when my dad came back. When we told him what had happened, he said, ""She was probably just drunk."" I remember looking at my friends, because even at 7, we all knew she was a lot more than drunk.

askgaybros,fex41wq,t1_fes2805,1579423958.0,">It's because we're viewed by other gay men the way women are viewed by straight men.

As a trans guy who who's kinda been on both sides of that, I don't think that straight women and gay men view men the same way. I think that often men hold other men to higher standards than women do to men. 

This is true *particularly* when it comes to hygiene and grooming. I only have experience with one queer guy, but we are good friends, so he answers all of my questions. I learned there was just so much stuff I appreciated that did before dates that he said was considered standard/bare minimum for a date with another guy. I dated more than one dude who thought he was straight that I had to tell to take a shower if they wanted me to touch their dick. And at first they get all defensive, and tell you that their *dick* is clean, even if they haven't showered in 5 days and rest of them smells, so they don't need a shower. Whereas gay dudes think, ""How clean would I like my date to be? I will take the time to make myself that clean."" 

I'm not close with very many straight women, but whenever the ones I knew talked about guys, it was more of a ""hot or not"", then talking about specific things, like how much he works out, or his dick. When they talked about specific features (I'm citing teenage girls here, mostly), it was primarily things people can't change like ""his eyes \[sigh\]"",cheeks, chin, jaw, hair type, etc. Criticized features were facial hair grooming, being too fat or too skinny, or having a ""weird looking face"" (women seem to care more about a guy's face than his body, or at least they care more than men do). 

I spent 7 of the last 8 years married to a total slob who thought he was straight, so it's possible that most straight guys have upped their grooming game in the 9 years since I was last dating. Any women reading this, or gay dudes for that matter, please tell me if I'm wrong, because my sample pool is not all that diverse."

asktransgender,fdhmfi8,t3_ele6lw,1578425745.0,"Reading the comments, and remembering middle school, I think that being told that your swearing is ""unladylike"" from someone who swears more than you do it one of those universal experiences that I think every woman, or person others assume is a girl/woman, experience at some point.

What struck me while reading the comments is that everyone (trans, cis, nb) seem to experience some sort of gender policing at some point in their life, but what I find interesting is how both criticism are almost always phrased. When women do anything outside of the gender norm are scolded for acting ""unladylike""; men who do something outside of the gender norm are criticized for ""being feminine"" or ""ladylike"". While the concept of masculinity is still criticized, we've found ways to twist our language to dance around it, criticizing individuals for their femininity, or lack of femininity."

Last week I went to pick it up at my local pharmacy, but they only gave me one vial for the month, instead of four (one each week). I was both specifically told not to reuse the vials, nor do I have the skills needed to pull 4 doses from one tiny vial. They said the insurance wouldn't pay for a vial each week unless the doctor writes ""patient cannot reuse vials"" on the prescription. I couldn't pick up that prescription, because I would run out before the month is over. As a result, I ironically had to reuse the previous week's vial last Tuesday.   

I've only got 24 hours now to get it filled for this week. I don't know if they submitted the ""don't reuse vials"" thing and it didn't work, or if they didn't submit it. (I've made the calls, am am waiting to hear back.)
