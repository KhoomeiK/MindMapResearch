mentalhealth,ffly3ln,t1_fflvlro,1580045554.0,"My therapist did not diagnose me but honestly those traits represent my social behaviour so accurately it's scary. I was thinking that maybe if I know what's wrong with me, I could look for more targeted solutions and identify with others having similar problems.

I'm in a really dark place right now after I finally had a little chunk of hope with this girl I had been talking to but that turned out to lead nowhere (probably because of my inaction and fear of intimacy). I'm slowly but surely losing all hope of ever being in a romantic relationship. It's funny because I profoundly fear yet crave so deeply being in one...

Also, I have brought it up during therapy and my therapist also communicated her frustration: she said she wants me to realise I'm not as worthless as I believe myself to be but she doesn't know how. She says we should continue looking for the underlying beliefs and historic events in my past and childhood to understand where my thought patterns come from, but my worry is that would not change my present behaviour and feeling towards myself and others. Maybe I'm expecting too much from therapy, I don't know."

socialskills,fduhnyg,t1_fdj7jp1,1578733142.0,"OMG, why is this all so relatable? I never see people feel the same way in real life...

I feel exactly the same way, I feel like I can't open up to people because my boring, mundane personality will be exposed. Whenever I really like someone and make a conscious effort to interact with them, things get so dull and boring, I talk about the most mundane things because honestly I don't know any better, which really just confirms the way I think about myself.

I also feel massively uncomfortable with intimacy and I don't even know why, I feel like I will do the wrong things and I freeze up whenever there is anything that remotely resembles physical touch. It's hard to believe it will ever get better since it's so deeply ingrained in my mind and behavior..."
socialskills,fdugaua,t1_fdj9p71,1578732538.0,"Good for you! This is really me, I have always struggled getting close to people and would lose them in a heartbeat as soon as we would go our separate ways. I feel like my personality just isn't there after years of avoiding to show my feelings and massive social anxiety so no one will like the ""real me"" anyways.

Only my story has a worse ending, I had the same situation with a girl where I could really be myself and I really liked her. She used to stay long hours at the office alone with me but I never had the guts to make a move. She has been very cold and distant with me for the last couple of weeks, our conversations went completely stale and we have lost our connection. I lost all hope at this point but glad to hear everything worked out for you."
socialanxiety,fdf6kd5,t3_ekyytn,1578354469.0,I get this too when I have to speak to someone with authority (e.g. boss/police officer/...). I prepare what I want to say in advance so much I just try to get it out as soon as possible and catch myself out of breath sometimes.

relationships,f9y4odj,t3_e7auz9,1575723325.0,"I think if she doesn't feel ready for it yet, it will be extremely hard to convince her. She obviously is not 100% sure about your future together if she's not ready to make the commitment. Honestly, I think it will be impossible to convince her with logical arguments or reasoning of any kind. Also, she saying ""it's not you"" doesn't necessarily mean it's really not you. I don't think any women will ever tell you the truth if it's really just you and she doesn't feel comfortable committing to spending the rest of her life with you.

If you feel like this is *the one*, you should focus on reassuring her that you are trustworthy and worth the commitment (but through actions and not logical arguments) but that may take some time. Maybe she feels like you only appreciate her for her physical beauty and she may be insecure about that as physical beauty tends to fade over time. Maybe she needs to be reassured that you appreciate other things about her. If you feel like that's a dealbreaker, maybe you are just not compatible or just want different things in life."
