pregnant,fftdk9u,t1_fftacjq,1580217378.0,My BFF is all about sacrificing her life for the kids like it's a badge of honor but I think I'm more like you. Her big thing is sleep schedule though - she says if they deviate it's a hot mess. How do you get around that with your babe? Teach me oh wise one!
Aug2020bumpers,ffssufi,t3_euz59q,1580191201.0,Oh man I just went for the blood test today and they told me they're going to email the results to me in a little over a week. I didn't even realize until now that that means I'll see the gender on my own first! Unless I wait for him to open the email? But I'm sooo anxious about the genetic tests I'm not sure I can wait...

pics,ffsrml1,t1_ffsolqp,1580189983.0,"Yeah I once worked with a guy who wouldn't eat a banana unless it still had some green on it. My husband likes them when they're mostly yellow. I personally am not a big banana person (not my fave fruit), so that's also part of why I stagger the ripeness of the ones I buy him. This way he always has nice fresh ones and none go to waste!"
AmItheAsshole,ffsgxqn,t3_euye4u,1580181440.0,"ESH - you snapped under the pressure of her very insulting remarks and lost control. I get it, it happens, but now your wife is trying to clean up the mess, and your unwillingness to meet her halfway on the peace-making is unreasonable. 

I think bottom line, you need to negotiate with your wife to end these month-long visits. I would lose my mind if my MIL came to stay with us for a month! Even a long weekend can be trying. It sounds like you've been trying to quietly endure her for too long, and this was the last straw that broke the camel's back. I understand this, I really do, but now you need to shift your focus towards keeping your marriage healthy. 

Right now, your wife is very upset and has some good reasons for being upset. She's probably not aware of how torturous these visits have been on you. I think you need to **calmly** explain your  position to her. Open up and be vulnerable with her about how your MIL's visits have made you feel (even if it is not in your nature to speak this way, do your best - your sincerity and vulnerability will help her to grasp the seriousness of the situation from your perspective). Explain that you know you lost control, and apologize for this. Then look to the future: How can we solve this together in the short term, and how can we solve this together in the long term? Explain that in the long term, you're not sure you can handle her living with you for a month anymore. Maybe a week or two maximum or maybe she stays in an apartment or hotel so you can have some space. Negotiate in good faith with your wife to come to acceptable terms both short and long term.

Good luck OP!!!"
AmItheAsshole,ffsevl6,t1_ffsb67f,1580180013.0,I hate to say it but I was thinking the same thing!
AmItheAsshole,ffsdk5a,t3_euyl6m,1580179127.0,"NTA !!! Your MIL is being a piece of work, trying to be possessive of your baby and backhandedly insulting you that her ""beautiful little princess"" doesn't look like you. 

This is right up there with the passive aggressive coworker I used to have who begged to see my wedding photos and then told everybody ""they don't even look like you"" because I was wearing nice makeup / had my hair done etc. Like, thanks for implying I look like a slob most days, I guess?

You need to talk to your husband though because while MIL can go fly a kite, your marriage actually matters. Your best bet to get through to him is to stay suuuper calm, very serious, and avoid being flippant at all for this conversation. That alone will tell him you mean business. Then calmly explain that you're sorry his mother's feelings got hurt, that wasn't your intention. Your intention was actually to get her to stop making remarks which come off very passive aggressively to you about how your beautiful baby looks nothing like you. Explain that you find those comments hurtful, and that you attempted to correct their behaviour by falling back on humor (like you usually do I assume, because you're one funny gal!), but unfortunately this one got lost in translation. Then suggest that he be the one to speak to his family and explain the situation. If he can get them to stop cracking wise about the baby, then you promise to tone it down, too. 

Congrats on the new baby!!!"
AmItheAsshole,ffsbxbl,t3_euylzk,1580178052.0,"I'm going with YTA only because you notified them about your concerns only 1 hour before the flight. That forced a panicky and urgent knee-jerk decision from everyone. I can understand why they are upset about that - they had no time to research or come to their own reasoned conclusions about whether to go without you, etc. You also left them with no time to re-book their vacation time at work."
AmItheAsshole,ffsb2y2,t3_euyoml,1580177490.0,"NAH - I think your need to back away is totally understandable and telling them why was indeed the right choice. While some of their reactions were unsavoury, I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that they were hurt to be losing the friendship over their own happiness (from their perspective). I'm not saying that that's fair of them or not, but I can get how a new hormonal mother might feel unsupported and upset if her longtime BFF broke up the friendship due to her new child, even if you framed it as best you could. I think it's just unfortunate that feelings were hurt all around and hopefully you can all just move on."
