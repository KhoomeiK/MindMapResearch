fatlogic,ff74jln,t3_ere8ar,1579640979.0,That makes me feel better.
fatlogic,ff73z0l,t3_erh8hm,1579640651.0,"It's the glutton never gets laid ""shrink."" Ignore it and let it eat itself to death because that's what it obviously wants."
popheadscirclejerk,ff2b8x8,t3_er4b6d,1579499428.0,Hilarious but kinda sad.
fatlogic,ff28htu,t3_er3kr1,1579496891.0,If I exercise will I learn spelling?
fatlogic,fey36ks,t3_eqob2b,1579440168.0,"She's right, I don't care."
LegionOfSkanks,feq3mp1,t1_fabor7m,1579337189.0,You must hate your penis.
fatlogic,fempteq,t1_fekfuo1,1579266017.0,"I have very long legs and an extremely short torso. Growing up I looked like a slightly more feminine Urkel, so feel your pain."
fatlogic,fempkye,t1_fekf2sn,1579265796.0,I have learned to embrace my weird honey linebacker shoulders. A broad shouldered woman with good posture can look almost regal.
fatlogic,fempapc,t1_fekfi3w,1579265524.0,Have you considered waist training? I barely had hips until I started wearing one.
fatlogic,femp3e4,t1_feka3rw,1579265329.0,All rompers are not created equal. I'm an athletic inverted triangle and some rompers make me look like an hourglass shaped goddess and others make me look like I'm wearing a 1920s style bathing suit. It depends on the fabric and cut.
fatlogic,femotp0,t1_fek38zd,1579265067.0,Shania Twain is a good example of an attractive woman who doesn't dress herself well.  Absolutely gorgeous woman but her fashion sense just isn't there.
fatlogic,femojp9,t1_femfnc3,1579264799.0,My mother had no chill. She would straight up tell me if something made me look frumpy or wasn't my color. I miss straight forward benevolent honesty.
AskMen,femo95l,t1_felpjm7,1579264503.0,Variety is the spice of life. But routine is the main course.
AskMen,femo0k1,t1_fekunm0,1579264254.0,I get it. I'm not into receiving oral but LOVE giving it. Haven't had any complaints.
AskMen,femnuw4,t1_felttgo,1579264091.0,My mom and dad were engaged 2 weeks after meeting and married 4 months later. They were together for 45 years until my mother passed away. When it's right it's right.
fatlogic,femf97w,t1_fejsse0,1579252426.0,"Omg. In past life as  a coked out anorexic stripper I got down to an A cup. I loved it, I never wore a bra. It was freedom."
fatlogic,fej2h4g,t1_fej0qzd,1579154443.0,"I will give Ms Metz credit, she has an almost impossible body type to dress and she does pretty well. She at least isn't afraid of color."
fatlogic,fej2cvk,t1_fej21an,1579154325.0,Deal.
fatlogic,fej2bfm,t1_fej22ql,1579154285.0,Just checking. Sarcasm is my first language.
fatlogic,feiz99u,t1_feivlco,1579151441.0,I hope turtle knows I'm kidding.
fatlogic,feiz4n2,t1_feixzw4,1579151330.0,Nope. Every time you compliment someone you're really being a fatphobic bigot. Check your privacy or something.
fatlogic,feiypd8,t1_feixw5a,1579150959.0,The inventor of Spanks is a billionaire so there's obviously a huge market. Pun intended.
fatlogic,feiyfpk,t1_feiwlqx,1579150728.0,I shouldn't wear florals. I'm too tall and broad shouldered; I look like a walking greenhouse.
fatlogic,feiycr8,t1_feiy6km,1579150658.0,Anything A-line is a no for me.
