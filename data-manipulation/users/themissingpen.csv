I also disagree with docking/cropping practices, even if I do aesthetically prefer the look. However I'm nowhere near creating a breed myself, just curious about how you'd hypothetically go about doing it."

relationship_advice,fcw3ys2,t3_eiyhsn,1578016604.0,"OP, do not water fast. Do not starve yourself. I have an eating disorder and I have done it. Here’s what happens: you get loose skin. It’s permanent. You can get rosacea. It’s permanent. Your teeth can rot and fall out and your breath stinks of acid and your mouth is permanently dry. Your skin dries up and cracks over your lips and your nails turn sickly blue. It does not look good. It messes up your hunger signals and metabolism permanently. If you do lose weight, you will want to do it slowly, preferably with a board-certified dietician (which is different from a nutritionist) and therapist to keep you from developing a full blown eating disorder.

Good luck, and congratulations on making a very tough but correct decision. Here’s to a wonderful 2020 :)"
