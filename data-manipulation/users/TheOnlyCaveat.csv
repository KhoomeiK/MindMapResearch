runninglifestyle,ff2w01k,t3_er750d,1579526276.0,"I (and every runner I know who has switched to plant-based, which is a lot of people) noticed a big boost in energy and a noticeable difference in how quickly I would recover from a hard workout or a long run. Really there is no reason NOT to eat plant-based. Supplement your B12 and vitamin D if you don't get a lot of sunlight where you live (good advice for anyone, really). Report back and let us know how you feel!"
