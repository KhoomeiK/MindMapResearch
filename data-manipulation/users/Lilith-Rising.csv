EDAnonymous,ffkbsiv,t3_etxtld,1580020190.0,"That’s a victory. I take up a lot of time from weighing because so take everything off even my watch, I can’t bear to see anything less than the lowest number but I just wan to be able to maintain and check once a week like a normal person and be able to stay freaking clothes without freaking out, without weighing multiple times a day. Good job on your work."
EDAnonymous,ffk0r4n,t3_etvs3v,1580012289.0,"Yeah I wish support would move from “ITS NOT UR FAULT No 1 wants thisss” to “you deserve help and compassion regardless of how you landed in this dark place.” Because I did want this at one point. When I was fucking fat as hell, this is what I dreamed of, and now what? I got what I wanted and won’t stop until I make someone real sad. To clarify, I didn’t want an ED, but to be able to starve myself for days and loose weight and have what I thought of as self control, but now it’s just habit and anxiety, there’s no discipline or control."
EatingDisorders,fehxft2,t3_ep0sl9,1579125793.0,"Yes, it’s just about changing the environment. It’s hard if you frame it as restriction, and it is often framed as such, then it’s going to mess with your Ed, but if you frame it as simply not an option to exploit an animal like u wouldn’t eat a baby or a pup, and see food availability as SUPER plentiful aside from those few options, there will not be that restriction nagging feeling, I’ve found. Gotta have staples in the house though bc one thing I’ve found is nothing compares to high protein meal to prevent my binges, you gotta learn to cook and not be lazy, it’s harder if you grew up in a culture that didn’t teach you to cook veg. I’ve been on both sides, restriction and binges and veg and not. It’s about priorities. But you can still have a smaller carbon footprint than say, a vegan who eats all these processed veg foods, just be mindful about your sourcing and remember that EVERYTHING comes at a price of exploitation, the degree you are complicit is something you need to examine for yourself."
fatlogic,fe0pnc9,t3_emudqk,1578817241.0,"Blows my mind when supposedly woke fat folks try to reach for anorexia because it’s still an idea of thinness that they want to own despite being fat, other eating disorder labels are so conveniently ignored in these conversations...internalized fat phobia much?"

fatlogic,fdhdpsr,t3_elda8u,1578420527.0,Food choice over a lifetime  is going to have a much higher impact on carbon footprint than food portion.
Instagramreality,fcticbl,t1_fctfz5n,1577944267.0,"You’re taking this like an attack when it’s a relevant post, do you know what sub you are on? That tattoo is not the only manipulated thing in the photo, simply the title of the post. Hope you feel better."
Instagramreality,fcti8es,t1_fcsouwv,1577944160.0,"It looks like pure digital manip like artwork or artstagram  instead of a girls post, too many of the features are off that it looks like a composite."
