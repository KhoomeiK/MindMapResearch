Malika has so much potential, yet the writers keep shoving her into the BLM narrative instead of focusing on a storyline. If she were like studying to be a police officer or lawyer, it would be an improvement over an annoying social justice warrior that keeps getting caught up in illegal situations."

baltimore,fdy9vm9,t1_fdx6q8x,1578777576.0,"They need money, often to support family, not injuries from unreliable and likely uninsured labor. The contract should go towards whoever is qualified, not lowering the qualifications and experience levels.

The fact that you started using a chainsaw when you were 12 means you built experience over time and proves my point relatively. It's not kid gloves to say that you don't put untrained labor where experienced workers are needed, because the untrained workers need money.

$40k is a lot of money, they want a good and skilled job done."
baltimore,fdx0keu,t1_fdw0mln,1578764113.0,"I don't like the city's management, but I don't think that complicated things that could involve serious injuries or complexities should be given to ""kids"" who took five week programs, especially when there are qualified and experienced adults that can do the job well. Absolutely, there should be normal landscaping opportunities available to them, but if they are not qualified for the contract, they aren't entitled to it.

Yes they are technically adults. But being legally an adult does not mean you are skilled with a chainsaw."

electronic_cigarette,fdkhuq5,t1_fdkhfvr,1578504173.0,"No, I was going to edit that actually. It does help cessation. I inserted the word ""completely"" to adjust that sentence.

Ending smoking is the main point of this whole thing. And yes, older people or people wanting to try something different should have easy access to non-tobacco flavors.

I'm not for it, but I'm for a temporary measure while it all gets sorted out. Perhaps minimal government intervention to ensure marketing is towards adults, that retailers are complying with laws, and that bulk purchases are limited for cigalikes."
electronic_cigarette,fdkh347,t1_fdkcffg,1578503736.0,"I do not support the banning of the pods flavors, but like Donald Trump said himself, it will just create a whole black market, but this path is probably the best option to minimize child access to mango, mint, but not completely interfere with the standard adult vapers (until May). 

I find it interesting that they actually chose the path of banning the pod flavors while allowing the open systems, because that was kind of what I was hoping would be the outcome, in comparison to a total ban. Honestly,  I would have preferred a simple adjustment with setting the age to 21 and not touching the flavours, but with people in the age gap to be grandfathered in.

The flavors aren't what is immediately attractive to the children, but the deep nicotine buzz, and the marketing that was targeting younger non-smokers did."
electronic_cigarette,fdk92dq,t1_fdk8h2s,1578498844.0," Yes, while closed systems are still vaping, the author misconstrued open tank systems and complicated and obtrusive, which in modern day, they aren't. 

For one, he/she took a stance on an opinionated ""analysis"" of the CDC data in the child intake ""epidemic"", and by using wording to make the number of children appear smaller, adult, and point trying vaping and not doing it more than once, to support his/her point."

Edge Insider probably gives better quality, or anything with the Playready DRM. Try using the actual Hulu app on the PC, which definitely has a chance of increasing the quality. Google Chrome only uses the Widevine DRM

Sometimes the video quality is in the actual video being served, but I have the feeling this isn't that, based on your screenshot. More likely it's just based on the combination of your setup, your ISP's setup and the number of people they are serving Hulu to, and your general connectivity ping times."
