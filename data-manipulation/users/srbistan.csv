Rottweiler,ff8qo6w,t1_ff88m9o,1579692091.0,"there are reddit accounts for sale out there and both those with positive and negative karma can fetch value (that's why you don't feed trolls, especially here).

there are various categories of accounts - by age, karma score, name attractiveness and what not, and the pricing is relative to those. easy thing to look up, sorry but i won't dignify any of those parasitic locations a link (as that too boosts their page ranking).

i just glanced over that ""market"" months ago to see what is it about, i'm far from being an expert in this vector of marketing, but as you are well aware reddit can boost your sales or web traffic significantly (among some more benign things you could do) if played well and that is actually not too hard to pull off.

this sub is plagued by these people for a long time now, mods do what they can (one of them was kind to explain), but these aren't men they're fucking locusts and just keep coming. the thing is -we (rottie lovers) are an easy target with rotties being so cute, upvoteable and alike to one another. check the poster before you upvote when you can, but don't get paranoid - i managed to insult a genuine poster new to this sub (something i'm sorry for - if you're reading mate :) )."

Dogtraining,ff7gb8e,t1_ff70lco,1579648885.0,"pardon me if i sounded a bit rude before - but i had this discussion N times now, and it is becoming an unpleasant routine. 

i do appreciate and support dog welfare (put shortly) you promote. i too love dogs and wouldn't hurt them in any way, please try read following with that in mind. i wouldn't be bothered to write this if i didn't think we were on the ""same side"".

if it matters, some ""mall ninja stuff"" ahead, only this is humble truth: i had a bit more experience in handling and training dogs than 12 years, double that with my own dogs and after that (european) army, private for the army and police service, state security, sniffer dogs, pet dogs, behavior problems (can give you details pm if you want)  but that is besides the point. 

i tried every tool i use on myself before using it on dogs. e-collar, spiked collar, check chain included and i know exact stress level i'm applying on a dog and take great care not to harm animal emotionally let alone physically. for the record i avoid using anything else but check chain, but dog industry ~~can be~~ is cruel. 

i understand this can sound a bit as excusing causing harm to an animal, but on some levels of needed obedience, level of stress on a dog is necessary and i have learned over time how to balance it to fit different dogs for for different obedience levels needed. 

you speak of ""choke"" chain, which although a same physical object is not the same thing as ""check"" chain in terms of how you use it. you don't choke the dog, absolutely not. causing discomfort and hurting are different things and  choking dog is counter productive in this technique. using a check chain is a technique hard to explain in writing, nor will i try, but very effective and relatively stress-less for the dog. 

mind you - there is a certain stress involved, no denying that, but compared to dog being hurt or hurting someone else and/or ending up abandoned/lost/euthanized - i'd take it anytime. now days i train/fix pet dogs by recommendation, and owners are present, watching what i do with their dogs. those people adore their dogs and wouldn't let me hurt them but can't cope with their dogs anymore and these are past point of clicker training. 

as for dogs slipping out of harnesses - which brought us here, my logic is : i don't know these people, i don't know how much they're willing to invest themselves into this before dog ends up runaway and killed in traffic(looks like they're urban). now, that's a small pit bull and they're wiggly bastards, i know that jump OP described and this is most simple, 100% effective solution to help that dog in one short, readable post. if OP has honestly interested for details how to train dog with it (which s/he didn't) i would surely explain.

sorry for the long post, i do hope i managed to pass my message despite the language barrier. finally if i'm expected to delete my post or i whatever means ""to comply"" that is not going to happen. if that means ban from here, so be it-  so long and thanks for all the fish /r/dogtraining."
