1:Stationary targets: great for practicing form. From t-ball to grunts running around sandbags with bayonets. It helps you master body mechanics. Any weapon is just a half-assed tool until it becomes an extension of your body by way of mastered fluid movement. 

2:What does it matter if he cuts all of the bamboo?:
The people saying “fuck if he hit me once I’m dead,” you’re right. However, by mastering the correct technique, the wielder is able to conserve momentum for the next attack and avoid becoming a victim of the following enemy. 

3: this is all explained in GZA’s *Liquid Swords* and if you can’t dig it it’s because your lyrics are weak, like clock radio speakers."

stephenking,fdb28il,t1_fdaceqe,1578252912.0,"One could make that claim about a lot of SK’s novels, that there are a lot of derivative backstories, but I like them nonetheless. The backstories sometimes drag and lack the punch of of more economical writers (Barth’s Lost in the Funhouse, Anderson’s Winesburg, Ohio, Joyce’s Dubliners, come to mind) who aim to paint a larger portrait of life by utilizing setting and culture, but SK’s forte has always been people who find themselves under extraordinary (often paranormal/supernatural) stress and how they react under a that stress, what people do to one another that they otherwise would not do. So while yes, SK sometimes meanders with backstory, it feels somehow worth it and honest to slog through those moments; the payoff is more often than not worth it. Tommyknockers was enjoyable for me. However, where SK was, in my opinion, less successful was in novels like Cell, where the Luddite techno-commentary came off as heavy-handed and detracted from the story."
