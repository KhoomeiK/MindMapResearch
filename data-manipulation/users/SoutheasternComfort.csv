Hedgehog,ffigev7,t3_etom5u,1579973254.0,"This is actually surprisingly common in hedgehogs, and could mean a lot of things. Often either hair got tied around and cut off blood, or he was stressed and chewed it off. That's pretty rare and more indicative of a deeper problem like possibly cancer(also surprisingly common in hedgehogs). There should be some pet hospital you can find. In lieu of that, just try to disinfect the wound(hydrogen peroxide shouldn't hurt him) and just let him chill with some food. Then take him next time they open"

Your example now is something your child will remember and ask about for the rest of their lives. Whether you're alive or not you'll significantly influence their lives. And what something like that teaches is 'it's okay to hurt people as long as you're mad and you're right'. You were bullied as a kid? Break the cycle. Teach your kid to be the bigger one.
