AbandonedPorn,fh57cca,t1_fh52pqr,1581285690.0,"I agree with all of this except the last point. Interestingly, this neighborhood is very close to downtown Albany where most of the jobs in the city are located. Unfortunately, Albany hasn’t had the urban revival a lot of cities have in the past decade or so. Many reasons for this but one is that the property taxes in the city are so high compared to the surrounding suburbs. 
The city itself has so many government and non profit buildings (state schools, etc), that the residents pay a huge tax premium. And the schools in town aren’t good, from what I understand, so young families aren’t moving back in. The prices they pay elsewhere get them a better value. 
This neighborhood in particular has been very resistant to economic development- people have been trying but it hasn’t been sticking. The jobs are there- but everyone wants to live in Saratoga."
Albany,fh2yir5,t1_fgtnhin,1581262533.0,There’s a FB group- ADK Capital Region young members that’s schedule group hikes all year round. I’ve never actually been on one but they’re very active. I think it’s a private group but you should be able to search for it.

Albany,fedcd0h,t3_eogdg0,1579007446.0,"I think Albany is like a lot of places in that you get out what you put into it. I’m a transplant, and I like it here. But, being someone who loves the outdoors certainly helps because you’ve got the Adirondacks, the Catskills, and the Berkshires all so close. I’ve made a lot of great friends here too. I can agree that it’s not the most exciting place, but it depends on what you’re looking for how much you’d like it here."
