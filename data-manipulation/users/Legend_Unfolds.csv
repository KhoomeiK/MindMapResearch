when you have nothing and they have everything, it's all I can think about. something quite wrong with me, but I like feeling like I mean something. meeting people who are better in every way instantly invokes a feeling of hate for them.

I never show it of course, I don't want to be nasty because of how I feel, but I do feel that way about them."
GetMotivated,ff0zrsg,t3_eq13nd,1579473843.0,"I didn't notice this. I have always been me and a journey into fitness didn't change that. I was told a better body would boost my confidence and that I'd feel happier but neither ever happened. never got any compliments or interest either. 

I look at myself now and ask if it was worth it. No is usually the answer.

The only thing that changed was how I looked. Still a disaster, just a better disguised one."
wholesomememes,ff0uxdo,t3_eqx1w7,1579472502.0,"I can't approach and ask out people I like, I don't have the courage to do it and I've tried to find it before. heck, I don't even talk to friends first unless it's extremely important. I only hope somebody likes me enough to approach me first but being a guy that doesn't seem very likely."

wholesomememes,febjp0c,t1_febh9gs,1578959536.0,"Appreciate the thought but I wouldn't be here talking about it If I was enough. I'm just not as good as the others, I accepted that a long time ago, Its who I am, wouldn't be me otherwise.

I might not ever get a happy ending because of it, that's just something I'll have to live with. Hope has been in short supply my life, because I can't ever deliver upon it.

Same for this. makes sense Nobody pays attention to the nobody. Something else I have to learn to live with."

I'm not enough to compete with even more of a disadvantage."

Feels like even simple thoughts like this only happen in fairy tales and romances."
wholesomememes,feaxs4n,t3_eo53qw,1578953313.0,"almost nothing worked out. not sure 12 year old me would have been happy to hear that, or would have continued knowing that.

At the same time though I wouldn't be me if that didn't happen. forced a few changes that wouldn't have happened if things did work out.

Can't help but wonder what future would have been better for me at 12."

dauntless,fcu5h26,t3_eiwuit,1577973034.0,"Trials is just stupid, I'm pretty sure everyone who tried it agrees. One-shots, insane modifiers, load times, hit-detection, Time limits, rapid tonic depletion... It all combines to make a pretty miserable experience if you're not interested in the leaderboard.

To be honest I think the people who say it's okay only really care about losing places on the leaderboard when it's reworked. The gamemode is trash and needs to be improved massively, but because they're king of the trash, they feel they have to defend it, y'know what I mean?

I don't understand how anybody (With nothing to lose) can play trials and think it's good as it is, especially compared to other similar games which handle their hardest challenges in a clearly superior way."

gtaonline,fc40t68,t1_fc3p2xe,1577403642.0,"I don't think everybody else likes what I like. Personally I thought the simplistic rims and the white on the tires worked well with the color and shape of the car. While it's not exactly original, It still looked good in my eyes, but without drawing the focal point of the picture to them.

Obviously from the responses I was the only one who sees them that way. 

Looking on the bright side, I'm pretty happy the only complaint is an easy fix, At least I know next time to try something more original on the wheels."
gtaonline,fc2s3f0,t1_fc2e5s2,1577372405.0,"The wheels aren't really the focus of this picture but I guess I was the fool for expecting constructive feedback from this subreddit without directly asking for it. I was looking to improve composition and use of effects/filters to change the look, I was actually anticipating the biggest negative response would be to me using my own character in the pic.

Any ideas/suggestions other than the wheels? I could quite easily try and copy parts of this picture with other wheels/ another car if you think it'd improve it?, but I'm really looking for feedback concerning effects/filters and composition."

Great fun watching people try to figure out where you are once they realize you're using drones."
