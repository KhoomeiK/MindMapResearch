electricians,fev9gmh,t3_eqn6g6,1579394730.0,Option number two is not an option unless what you take that neutral from is the exact circuit the switches are currently powered from. To do otherwise risk doubling the safe current that neutral can carry back to the panel. I.e. if it’s a 15 amp circuit it may end up carrying 30 A.
