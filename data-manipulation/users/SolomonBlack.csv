Like the description states ""the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong"" and you've just like at a minimum laid a compulsion on the minds of the entire prime material plane or worse changed the nature of reality. 

Perhaps particularly in Forgotten Realms where acts of this scale need *12th* level spells, mythals constructed by huge circles of mages, etc. With side effects including the destruction of empires. One punk Djinn with a normal (albeit mighty) spell is not going to outweigh the whole Weave/Mystra. 

In general Wish is still not a spell that functions on lawful stupid literalism. At least not anymore. Because arbitrary abstract rules make for weak stories and the whole thing is just in universe rules lawyering. 

A better, perhaps even the best, way to look at it is as an act of pure magic pushing your will onto reality... but that means you have to *know* what you are doing when you make the wish and create a form that can actually have depth and meaning. Just saying ""I wish..."" and expecting a perfect result is like saying you understand a symphony because you can press the play button. When actually understanding it fully would require an indepth understanding of each instrument, musical theory, conducting, etc, etc. 

So a master wizard (or djinn) yeah they have a sound enough understanding of magic to replicate normal spells or some relatively small feats... but not have an effect of universal scale."
dndnext,ffji5xj,t3_etwkyq,1579998743.0,"The ""problem"" with having a mana pool for a table top game is that it after awhile it stops being *effortless* math. Sure subtraction isn't hard (you're already doing it with HP) but its one more you have to take a few seconds to be *sure* you're getting right lest you cheat yourself out of resources. And the less math you need when its several hours into game night and you are finishing up your first six pack maybe the better. 

One of the reasons we might suspect DND even developed Vancian magic is because when you are preparing spells its very easy to say make a list of your spells and cross them off as you use them, or even have spell cards you discard like some children's card game. Even with 5e's abandonment of full Vancian casting having no more then 4 slots makes it trivial to keep track of them. One could even imagine having various tokens you discard, particularly if say a group has had trouble with munchkins 'forgetting' how many they've used already.  

You also always have a very clear idea of your resources because you can cast Fireball X times and Magic Missile the darkness Y times. You also can then save one for the right moment, or not have to worry about using one costing you the chance at the other somewhere down the road. Or maybe even have to get a little more creative because you can't just spam your best spells."

They're half-elves for the lower planes, except actual half-breeds were already a thing (cambions) so they're like quarter or eighth fiend or even more removed but like randomly popping up in a bloodline. They first appeared as part of Planescape where they make the most sense as well just sort of what you'd expect in the fabulous trans-planar cosmopolitan omnicity of Sigil. 

Outside of that well they used to look passably humans and/or elvish ([for example](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/baldursgategame/images/4/4f/Haer%27Dalis_NHAER_Portrait_BG2.png/revision/latest?cb=20180925155705)) and were supposed to be really quite rare along with their aasimar and genasi counterparts. Which is to say they didn't have cultures of their own it was a way you could just give your boring old daughter of nobility a mark of special destiny or whatever. Not that this stopped players of course though they were never more then modestly popular. Either because well its sizable snowflake flag or just how in 3.5 they had level adjustment which never worked out quite right.

Then in 4e it was decided to not only promote them to PHB race but to give them their present horny devil appearance. Which of course makes the whole blending in special heritage thing above rather less tenable. Not sure how (if ever) this was addressed for actually living as hellboy/girl save that in Forgotten Realms the living tieflings all were changed by Asmodeus' shenanigans, suddenly sprout tails out of their bums and so forth. Guess they all just get to be outcasts even harder or what not. 

Anyways for you concept though... well at no point have Tieflings actually been from the Nine Hells. They have a planar heritage but are still fundamentally mortals. Both culturally and mechanically they should not survive childhood in the Nine Hells. Like you wouldn't be a slave (that's what say lemures are for) you would be a meat toy to be flayed for three seconds of kicks. Or worse. And no some devil isn't going to raise you as a weapon because they see your potential or something, they've got plenty of that action going on already and you've already basically given up the main bargaining chip mortals have to play. To say nothing of fire resistance not really measuring up to a lot of the potential hazards.

One of which failed miserably and the other well I've not seen people play much in my circle of observation unlike when 5e launched... but still too early to tell. 

Anyways see the thing is you've created a fix to a problem... but once you fix a problem you well *don't have a problem* anymore. So now your solution is going to be looked at not against what it now isn't fixing. If you don't have an alternative that is actually a solid gameplay structure on its own well you'll probably with something pretty bland. As your game was too busy reacting when it needed to be creating. 

So what about our funny dice scale? Well there's nothing odd about those odd numbers, the scale comes directly from rolling 3d6 like it was in the days of the elder grognards. Today still rolling for stats is great if you just want to get the game moving, not theorycraft every part of your build out. Point buy isn't hard of course but it is a bit laborious by comparison especially without aids... and comes after you've easily grokked rolling for your stats. 

Other games with much smaller stats exist but they also do many other things differently. Like Storyteller has generally nine stats in three categories rated 1-5, but they add dice you roll in a pool not modifiers. Very apples and oranges.

Instead of trying to simplify a system that works, well it would be nice if those odd scores did have a few more applications. Not general bonuses but say Carry Capacity like things. What escapes me though."

There are a few exceptions of course but consider how say Polearm Master doesn't just say you do +X damage but instead opens up a new way of attacking, while GWM/Sharpshooter does so at a trade off and have other features. It might come out to that but its not quite the same either. And a Fighter has several valid play styles open to them, which don't all benefit from any single feat ergo. 

Now here's the question for you... what sorcerer *wouldn't* take this feat at some point? If this was an official feat it would instantly be *mandatory* in everyone's sorc recommendations. Probably at level 12 to complete whichever of Empowered/Heightened/Quickened/Subtle/Twinned Spell your build still lacks. The only real competition being Elemental Adept for draconics but even for fire draconics that one isn't necessarily a pay off, if the DM only throws out resistant enemies occasionally or goes right for the immune ones. So it might not be ""OP"" in a ""break the game over my knee"" sense but it would still be better then other feats and you're pretty SAD too.

There's simply no way for gnomish warrior Ruby Cloudguts to swing around a weapon that oversized that isn't either silly, lame, or like something out of an anime. And 5e really isn't going for such obvious (mundane) superpowers. Which is all to say that a feat to get out of it is a bit of a poor trade. As opposed to oh the DM letting say small races with Athletics out of the rule or something. (Or free if they just don't care)

Also having what's what's half racial feat be half useless for others though is probably bad form. As is the Str requirement being high enough you must devote a racial bonus or ASI to it first, instead of getting to debate the matter a level 4. Ya know because the game isn't only about optimized play and can be viable well below that. So 13 probably is the prereq used in the PHB for a reason, though 15 would also be reasonable matching the plate requirement. (Also its not really a trade off) 

Now then for the latter you talk about dual wielding greatswords but a more immediate issue would be sword and boarding. A 2d6 great sword does on average 7 damage and a dueling style supported d8 long sword/rapier/warhammer does 6.5... but a dueling great sword will be pumping out 9 damage on average.

Nevermind in the lore being an ""epic caster"" is often not so cheesy as tabletop has been AND being able to win the final battle is really not the whole adventure.

Second off before you put any money down figure out how you are going to play. Because the preparations you make are different depending on if you are a player or a DM. If you just want to try the game you might find your local gaming shop, they may host games there or be able to hook you up with someone. There's also the D&D Adventurers League around. 

If you join as a player then all you need is the PHB (and wait on the rest) or even just [the 100% free Basic Rules](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules) downloaded. The preceding link is also has 'complete' rules, everything else is simply more options not the core mechanics of the game so its worth looking through and seeing if you grok it since it don't cost a thing. You can also swing by say a Barnes & Noble grab a PHB, then settle down with a drink in the cafe looking through it then put it back on the shelf when you are done. 

Assuming you are going to start up your own group and thus probably be running the show well for your first session I would say either the Starter Kit (Lost Mines) or Essentials kit plus a PHB for the group 'should' be all that is needed. I wouldn't worry about having the best story right off the bat, just get your dice rolling and hopefully kick some arse. Of the two the Essentials kit looks to have a little more useful swag with maps and a DM screen, but I confess to never having used either so I can't say for sure.

Going forward as DM what you would *need* is the PHB and the Monster Manual. The Dungeon Master's Guide is also extremely helpful if not (as it will tell you) quite essential because 5e relies first and last on your discretion as DM thus rarely proscribes how things must function.

Okay now as for DND Beyond, well I have never used it because in the long term it *will* go away one day (probably when WotC introduces a 'better' service) and I dislike the idea of not having a pdf that is *mine* to hold on to. Also having gamed since before phones/tablets were available, much less official content to put on something electronic, while I find laptops a bit clunky and distracting. Course I'm also maybe a hypocrite because I never have time to play IRL anymore and so only play online thus exclusively use my laptop, also I'm a bit of luddite with these new fangled online options. If you feel pulling something up on your screen is more convenient then flipping pages then more power to ya though.

I'm pretty sure shove is *not* an unarmed strike because nothing describes it as such. It is a, quoth the PHB, ""special melee attack"" made as part of the Attack action. It doesn't care about your weapons at all. 

What you *can* do however is using the Attack action make one attack with your claws, make a additional attack with your claws as per their rules, then replace your second attack with a d4 unarmed strike and finally make your bonus action grapple. 

So all you actually lose is 1 damage on average. Well after you hit level 5 and can launch the combo.

dndnext,fetq6ks,t3_eqetnh,1579378284.0,"Pathfinder is a highly modded and patched version of a broken buggy game. It runs yes and you can find lots of bells and whistles to add to it but damn is it rickety if you step back and actually look at the underlying construction. So kinda like playing a Bethesda game.

People like to tell you its about choices but this party line only came about after 5E rolled a natural 20 on DND's save-or-die roll. What publisher Paizo *originally* set out to do was just file off some of the worst of 3E without creating a new game like 4E did. And 3E is a horrible mess of broken endlessly escalating mechanics where cheese builds included (warning: not a joke) becoming a god with unlimited stats and powers. Even stopping that cheese you still had many many many problems most prominently that magic users could cast encounter changing spells every turn while martial types could... hit something with a sword. Once. 

Pathfinder addressed *some* of this. 

Like in 3E if you didn't have magic you often didn't have much in your class beyond increased attack progression for levels. So Paizo gave the Fighter a ton of bonuses in class to make it more appealing. They also gutted a lot of the worst magical loops, like casting Wall of Iron to churn out unlimited gold. The best example though is what they did to Polymorph and shapeshifting et al. Where 3E through a few spells let you basically become any monster in the game (with the numbers growing every book) picking and choosing the best stats and abilities for any situation and 5E mostly only lets you turn into animals of modest scope... Paizo has a bunch of spells turning that emphasize you're a fake version of say a dragon and proscribed semi-set boosts instead. Which fixed the OP problem, but also meant you could turn in to the world's weakest bear if you didn't have a decent Str score in the first place. 

However without 5Es Concentration mechanic nothing stops a caster from blanketing the field with new and powerful magics every single round, twice with Quicken Spell, fairly often stacking penalties on top of what you already incurred. Something made worse by options to boost the DCs on your spells so they can be nigh impossible to make saving throws for. And that casters can cover themselves in a thousand different defensive spells. And since you broadly have two to three times the spells, running out is often not problem. 

Conversely ordinary attacks tend to suffer from major restrictions. Unlike 5e every extra attack comes with cumulative -5 penalty and if you move you only get to make one attack. Some of which some builds can redress with abilities, though probably more focus on just dishing out as much damage as possible in a single hit and/or hoping the GM will keep something close enough to hit. Other builds can have it worse, needing a whole chain of feats to avoid penalties and do their even trick semi-effectively.

Which brings me to perhaps a central gripe about PF vs 5E which is fake choices/advantages. Because while you can fine tune a build in PF quite bit... in practice you often have to either combine three features to stack up enough of a bonus to do what you want competitively OR you need to meet a number of prerequisites that you maybe don't feel the need or want for. And plenty of the paths are dead ends so if you don't know what you are doing you can end up with a total mess of a character that can't quite do anything. I once heard Pathfinder described as needing three feats to use the toilet properly... and that isn't far off. 

Much of which in turn is driven by the other central problem which is superficial numerical inflation. In 5E the PC scale is mostly d20 add [-1 to +11] but in PF you hit that somewhere after level 5 and things keep going up... except nothing goes up unless you cultivate it. So you can have a legendary swords wielder that can slice through plate like butter but can't climb a wall to save their life. Worse though since the scale can be sooo huge well anything the GM actually intends to be a challenge will have boosts added to eliminate the advantage. So sure you have +25 to whatever but you since you need a 35 to get through, its still a 50/50 chance. And all those big bulging bonuses can easily end up being just for casually making anyone five levels below you irrelevant (you big hero) but not actually making things easier for the real challenges. And everyone is forced to be super specialists stuck in their niches. 

It also frankly has a way of making the game less interesting because you have to jump through so many hoops just to say competitive. Like you get magic items in Pathfinder... but you end up having to spend most of the budget there on boosts to your many stats because you ""should"" have a +4 enhancement bonus to Cha around level 9 (or whatever) instead of say getting to spend it on a flying carpet to cruise the world in style."

Also I'm flipping through the MM right now and finding plenty that do more then just damage. Like the humble Carrion Crawler who has two attacks... but read the unbold print and the tentacle attack is a poison that will paralyse you. While the Centaur on the next does ""just"" do damage but with its Charge it can deal out 19 average damage, and then hit you for another 11 with its hooves. If you're not a Barbarian (or even if you are) then you're probably still going to feel that even well above its CR or you're rocking the best AC. And with a 50 ft move and a longbow it can pepper away at you from a distance, so its not like it doesn't have tactical options. 

While at the other end of the spectrum you've got an endgame boss monster like the Mummy Lord who's got four different ways to screw around from its Legendary Actions as well as its spells and Dreadful Gaze. And even its ""normal"" attack carries a curse effect. Of course it is maybe a little fragile so could use some back up, but its hardly slightly different HP, AC, and attack numbers.

> Thanos's first appearance was in The Invincible Iron Man #55 (February 1973), featuring a story by Jim Starlin that was co-scripted by Mike Friedrich. The storyline from that issue continued through Captain Marvel #25–33 (bi-monthly: March 1973 – Jan. 1974), Marvel Feature #12 (Nov. 1973), Daredevil #107 (Jan. 1974), and Avengers #125 (July 1974). He returned in an extended storyline that spanned Strange Tales #178–181 (Feb.–Aug. 1975), Warlock #9-11 (Oct. 1975 – Jan. 1976), Marvel Team Up #55 (March 1977), and the 1977 Annuals for Avengers and Marvel Two-in-One (Thanos does not actually appear until the end of Warlock #9). He was also featured in a short backup story in Logan's Run #6 (June 1977) and had a small role in the Death of Captain Marvel graphic novel (April 1982).

So technically not quite but more significantly I dare suggest Starlin would have found somewhere to rip off Darkseid sooner or later. The man loves his pets so dearly. Also at least from the bits I've actually read loves them to the exclusion of anyone else making say the original Infinity Gauntlet actually rather tedious. Save that having a boner for Death is a better motivation maybe.

dndnext,feclww8,t3_eocg6v,1578977159.0,">One aspect of 5E that has always been troubling to me is feeling pigeon-holed into particular race/class combos because of the combination of main stats and racial bonuses. With 5E's tight dice range makes ability modifiers very important (the +2 racial bonus = 4 levels of proficiency modifier adjustment).

Comparing to the proficiency scale sounds a bit like you are looking for a reason to let yourself be pigeonholed. 

Because you're not somehow 4 levels behind which involves far more then proficiency, but just a +1 behind. And even that will vanish over the longest term when ASIs cap out so over the longest term. And while a 5% worse chances on any particular roll is not insignificant, the chances are you are going to fail by a greater margin, or that said failure is not going to kill you. 

I'm not going to pretend that every choice syncs up wonderfully of course but there are interesting options out there. Like say dwarf wizards, nothing wrong with more HP and then either even more HP or armor proficiency. Long as you are getting some kind of benefit out of it rolling with a 15 is perfectly viable."
dndnext,feci32w,t1_fecc1es,1578974444.0,Well yeah its bad enough the main classes have to hang out with them at all. Suggesting that turning tricks for some magical bygone makes you as smart as a wizard? **Ridiculous.**
dndnext,fecg8ya,t1_feceaqg,1578973177.0,I guarantee you if a DM has never called you on that nonsense its because they just casually assumed summon spells conjures up extra PCs instead of requiring them to select and then run NPC beasts. Which admittedly is more work for them.
