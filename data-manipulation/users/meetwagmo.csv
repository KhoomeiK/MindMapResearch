Dogtraining,feha0yt,t3_d0w2gl,1579112260.0,"When I introduced a new dog to my 2 year old husky, I had to make sure not to pay too much attention to the puppy or my big guy would get jealous. Dogs are sensitive, especially husky's. I would research a little bit on the tendencies of malamutes towards other dogs and be mindful. As far as toys go, it might just take time for them both to be more accustomed to each other. Both beautiful dogs btw <3"
