DatingAfterThirty,fcy6t16,t3_ef98g8,1578075620.0,"This goes for friendships, too. Narcissistic/toxic friends will leave you hurt and wondering what happened. The first time somebody treats you poorly, cut them loose."

Would love it if you joined."" His response will tell you everything."

\^ Being aware that you're suffering from anxieties and insecurities (as opposed to thinking that his behavior is problematic) is half the battle. Feel it all, and own it, but don't let it get in the way of making tactful decisions."
