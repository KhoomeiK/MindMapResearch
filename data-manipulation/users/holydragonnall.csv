gaming,ff6mhjk,t1_ff6ayx2,1579630351.0,"It's an extremely complex game if you're actually playing to survive as long as you possibly can. There are seasons, you lose access to easy, safe water and power fairly early on, and resources do not respawn so looting will only get you so far. It's also a pretty ugly game.

Honestly I'd recommend State of Decay 2 over Zomboid, it's the same idea, but it's a decent looking third person perspective instead and things aren't QUITE as granular as they are in Zomboid."
gaming,ff6m6iw,t1_ff6l321,1579630163.0,"Yes, you have to do certain things, because not only do you lose power, eventually you lose water as well, so if you haven't figured out a way to get more without using sinks and stuff, you're fucked. Seasons are also a thing, so you have to figure out how to have enough food for the winter when you can't grow any crops.

And sometimes a zombie horde will just come through wherever you're at and knock everything down, not because they know you're there, but just because that's how hordes move. If they hear you or see you though, you're can get fucked pretty fast."

You could see a lot of people in the main town, but hunts were still restricted to 4 and even the maps followed the old zone type areas.

The only realistic solution would be for companies to finish games or be actual months away from finishing them before they ever announced anything, which will never, ever, EVER happen, because they really enjoy getting their pre-order money a year in advance these days."

gamernews,ff40a8c,t1_ff3xob8,1579552738.0,It doesn't make any financial sense at all to delay a game that's working on current hardware so it can be an exclusive next gen release. The PS4 install base is the biggest the PS install base has ever been. That is not something you throw away just so your game can run a little bit better on consoles.
MonsterHunterWorld,ff3z9f8,t1_ff3wcjs,1579552105.0,"As much as I'd like a well done MMO type MH, I don't think it's the right path for the game, especially since most Japanese developers view MMOs as gacha-ready money machines and have proven that they don't really have the ability to run a decent MMO without extensive cash shop invasions. FFXIV is the only JP developed MMO I can think of that doesn't fall prey to this issue and even they still charge a monthly fee AND have a cash shop."
MonsterHunterWorld,ff3z4ve,t1_ff3x9pd,1579552026.0,"In my defense I've sunk hundreds of hours into every single release of MH since the initial PS2 release, some of them twice, like the JP and EN releases of Portable 2nd G/Freedom Unite and MHtri JP/EN releases. 

So I probably burn out a little faster these days, although MHW/Iceborne have offered enough new stuff to really keep me going quite a bit longer than I normally would have."

MonsterHunterWorld,ff3vtpa,t1_ff3mnir,1579549955.0,I have over 5000 hours of MH clocked over the full series. I wouldn't say each individual game offers as much playtime but 300-500 isn't abnormal if it really clicks for you.
MonsterHunterWorld,ff3voxl,t1_ff3ir0d,1579549873.0,"The route I went was installing a mod that let me buy monster parts from the store for 10x the sell price.

I was able to catch up to my 300 hours PS4 save in about 30 hours of play this way, without feeling dirty about cheating."
MonsterHunterWorld,ff3vbe9,t1_ff2yn2b,1579549638.0,"To be fair most of those complaints were operating off the (false) leaks that MHW would jettison almost everything that MH feel like MH. 

While the reality is that it REALLY streamlined the game and I personally feel like some of the charm was lost, it still feels like a MH game when you're fighting enemies, which is the number 1 thing I was hesitant about when they first showed it off and I had read those rumors. But anyone could see after they showed the first actual combat trailer that it was going to remain mostly faithful to the 'classic' style of MH combat."

I know how to deal with packs, how the upgrade system works, about oils and all that shit, etc. That doesn't change the basic fact that the combat system is third rate garbage. It doesn't even reach basic ARPG levels of good. Just because you can get around the bad combat by making it shorter, doesn't change the fact that it's no good."
