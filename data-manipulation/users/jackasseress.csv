ABoringDystopia,ffkfic7,t1_ffk4qs3,1580021920.0,"I’ve had similar frustrations as the other person but this perspective kind of helps. So these buildings are going up and they’re expensive *now* but the more that go up and the longer they’re around the more affordable they’ll be come. In theory.

It’ll be nice to have that affordable supply **some day** but as it stands, raising rent prices are fucking me and I’m going to complain."
