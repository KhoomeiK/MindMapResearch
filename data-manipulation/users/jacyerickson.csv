UnresolvedMysteries,fediijd,t1_fedh8j2,1579012402.0,"Reading another story reminded me of another potential bullet dodge. Around the same age I was on a school trip to the zoo or something. For some reason there weren't that many chaperones, we were just supposed to stay in a large group of 13 year olds. The clique quickly formed and kicked me and my friend out of their group, so us two young girls went off on our own. We were sitting down eating a snack when a man wearing regular clothes (no zoo uniform and name tag) passed by all the adults with kids to come up to my friend and I and offer us to go backstage and get to be up on stage for the special animal show. I LOVE animals and like I said was super naive, so I eagerly agreed. He said to follow him and started walking away super fast. I got up to follow him, but God bless my friend for stopping me. The clique group passed by at that moment and we told them what happened and asked if we could stick with them for safety, but they said they'd beat us up if we did. Fuck them. We ended up finding a young mom with her kids that was a stranger and hanging out with her for a bit before we had to head back to the bus."
UnresolvedMysteries,fedh8j2,t3_eo5vk6,1579011455.0,I lived near an elementary school growing up. One time when I was maybe 11 or 12 I was taking a walk around the neighborhood and was nearing the school. I had been looking down but got a sudden bad feeling. I looked up to see a man walking up the street in my direction. I was usually an overly naive child but I decided to cross the street. I kept going and when I looked back he had turned around and was heading DOWN the street (aka same direction as me) this time but parallel to me. I picked up my pace. He did too. I took off running and made it inside my house. In the following days there were reports of a creepy man talking to children outside the elementary school I was walking past at the time I saw the man I believe was following me. The description matched up. Not as dramatic as others but still gives me chills thinking of it.
