conlangs,fghw2nk,t3_eyeauc,1580795623.0,"If your goal is to create a good means for your dog to communicate, this is probably a good start. I have zero experience in training dogs, so I'll leave that advice to someone else. But depending on the dog's capacity to learn, you could teach it to use words in an intentionally boiled-down language like Toki Pona to communicate with you.

I'm not suggesting you actually teach it Toki Pona. But if you're asking conlangers about minimalistic languages, that's the one that comes to mind for me. Diving into that might inspire you to include/exclude certain things.

For example, maybe ""not"" isn't the right word, and ""no"" is, which would be used as both a negator and a standalone negative response. Maybe your dog just ends up using ""not"" like this anyway, so that's what it evolves into.

Or, maybe ""want"" isn't a necessary word. Your dog finds it sufficient to say ""Sherlock-Food"" instead of ""Sherlock-Want-Food"".

And maybe you find it's useful for him to be able to use your name, either to get your attention, or to ask you to do something, or however he wants to use it.

I think the goal here is to build a bridge between you and your dog. Training him on the meanings is good, but don't train him on grammar. Let him define that how he makes sense of it, and how it best communicates with you."

And I hear Moroccan Darija is particularly unintelligible to most of the rest of the Arab world.

One thing that fascinates me is that standard Arabic has only three vowels /a, i, u/, yet most of it's regional dialects have evolved to have at least five vowels /a, e, i, o, u/."
