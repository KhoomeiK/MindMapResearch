TeachingUK,fg04una,t3_ew6q0u,1580400248.0,"There's School Direct/SCITTs if you want a more school-based experience, and you can still get the bursaries. I've just done a similar thing, and both the SCITT and Schools Direct I applied to said that you could, so I'll be getting my MFL bursary on my SD programme in September."

TheSilphRoad,ffyni7f,t1_ffy433i,1580350626.0,That doesn’t invalidate what OP said. Being stabbed is worse than being punched but that doesn’t make being punched any more desirable.

JUSTNOMIL,ffuhpai,t3_ev8qha,1580242178.0,"I've worked with kids in familiar situations. Someone's spotted forbidden relative on site? The kid is taken to the library or some other isolated room, and the police are called. Anything else is wilful neglect and anyone involved in endangering a child should be deeply ashamed of themselves. I'm sickened to share a profession with people who are so arrogant and egotistical (and believe me I've seen plenty) they let their own biases affect the care they give children."
OpenUniversity,fftiroi,t3_ev2uap,1580221641.0,"Try these courses on OpenLearn to see what you think of the style:

[Am I ready to be a distance learner?](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/education-development/am-i-ready-be-distance-learner/content-section-0?active-tab=description-tab)

[And one of these introductory computer courses](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/free-courses/?filter=date/grid/651/all/Introductory/all/)

If you think they're okay, then give it a go straight to the degree!

Good luck!"
PartneredYoutube,ffnykgi,t1_ffnky0d,1580072300.0,"I'm far more likely to become a supporter on Patreon than watch a video with something I think is intrusive, so no, I probably wouldn't."
PartneredYoutube,ffncwzs,t3_euaauu,1580064424.0,"The moment I see a mid roll, I leave the video. I'd rather a pre-roll as it's supporting the creator without being an obvious cash cow."
fuckHOA,ffmnzjs,t1_ffmnlhb,1580057132.0,"I had huge anxiety about driving to the level of panic attacks because I thought too much about something people don't think about enough. It's 1 tonne hunk of metal, that a few hundred years ago would have been considered a war machine.

And yet people think it's fine to put on makeup or whatever while going 60km/h. Terrifying."
fuckHOA,ffmml3s,t1_ffmgsig,1580056737.0,"In the UK they had an advert a few years ago. It was a child saying something like ""If you hit me at 30, there's an 80% chance I'll live. If you hit me at 40, there's an 80% chance I'll die.""

That was a very impactful advert, as I saw it as a child and remember it to this day"
JUSTNOMIL,fflvt4e,t3_etzwtc,1580044791.0,Read about [Victoria Climbié](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Victoria_Climbié). People like her get murdered because scum like MIL decide their power games warrant CPS time more than little girls potentially being tortured to death
