It's not easy to be pals with someone when there are no common interests. 

Wedding dress shopping is pretty personal, and a wknd of it with someone you don't even consider a friend outside of work is a big ask.

The rejection was NOT of her as a person, in any way! That said, clearly if it's now awkward between you, she's feeling hurt and must have considered the two of you more than co-workers. It wouldn't hurt to have a brief chat, maybe take her to lunch, and just clear things up...?"
dating_advice,ff2k6wb,t1_ff21e73,1579509895.0,This is great advice!! Seconded.

BDSMAdvice,ff0ex66,t3_eqx0yk,1579468246.0,"Thank you for this post! I was wondering today if there were ""lessons"" anywhere. Or if I could somehow be an observer in someone else's bdsm life. Lol"
BDSMAdvice,ff0eiin,t1_fezgq11,1579468134.0,"Does ""both collared"" mean they switch? Or they're both sub and not married to each other? I'm very new to this topic and thought ""collared"" referred to a sub..."
BDSMAdvice,feysick,t1_feyh3kk,1579450071.0,Ok cool. I understand much more now. Just having fun trying to figure out how to begin adding some bdsm into our sex life. Read through the idea section and am still just learning about the types and motivations and all of it. Thank you again.
BDSMAdvice,feyewr9,t1_fey9kuf,1579444559.0,That all sounds pretty wonderful to me. Thank you again for sharing so much of your personal journey!
BDSMAdvice,fey81z1,t1_fewe1n1,1579441964.0,Cool. Thanks again!
BDSMAdvice,fey7l14,t1_fey1x6s,1579441813.0,"Hi! Very helpful, and thank you so much. May I ask, why or how is it still enjoyable to either of you if you are crying? Is this bc your task is painful? And if so, why do you keep going? I love that your dd checks in. I understand that checking in and your consent to continue means whatever is happening isn't considered by you to be abuse. Is this the correct understanding? (The pain component is scary to me and also a little fascinating.)

Happy for you that he is your best friend and such a great teacher!"
BDSMAdvice,fey5h3q,t1_fey0dir,1579441050.0,"Thank you! This brings up even more questions (which can be totally ignored if too personal). Does the fact that this describes me as a person in general/irl mean that I would be a bdsm brat as well? By ribbing do you mean roasting/""normal"" banter and/or sexual jokes/banter or something entirely different?

I am just beginning to understand *some* of the dynamics driving bdsm. I think I might be a switch bc I want to try being dominated, *and* I want to try being the dom. Are the terms Dom and Top synonymous in most cases, or just some? And you being masochistic means you enjoy pain, right? If so, is it enjoyable/a turn-on bc of an adrenaline rush? And does someone who enjoys administering pain do it because it turns the sub on? The idea of the  pain aspect is kind of disturbing/scary to me. And brings up a whole slew of more questions."

BDSMAdvice,fexwc1p,t1_fesi3e3,1579437563.0,"Newbie here. Is a Daddy any different from a Dom? And how are respect and submission shown by a sub? I'm picturing a sub already tied/restrained in some way. (You sound like the perfect dom for a newbie, and a great 'teacher.')"
BDSMAdvice,fexv7b0,t1_fes9m22,1579437072.0,"Hmm ok...what is the difference between being a sub and being a brat? I am newish here and just ""dipping a toe in"" as they say. I think I thought that a brat IS a sub...maybe a subset of sub...but here you say you're a brat but not a sub..."

JUSTNOMIL,feruju1,t3_eqcxpq,1579358517.0,"WOW!! GOOD JOB!! Yeah - she is DEFINITELY a pretty damn bad JNMIL for every single thing you mentioned! My GOSH. SO will need to double down and keep building his spine as well. That one talk will *NOT* shut her fake-smiling-ass down AT. ALL. There WILL be further fallout and she is likely to push back harder and harder thinking those spines are still young and that she may still be able to break them down if she tries hard enough. But STAY STRONG and it will get easier.

PLEASE keep us posted!"

We are the ones that are near and able to help her and visit her, and he gets the shitty attitude 100% of the time.
