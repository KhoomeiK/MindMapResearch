AdviceAnimals,ffhtjtd,t1_ffht9b8,1579953175.0,All the dentists’ offices in our county use an on call system. They take turns. They all cover for each other. I live in a very small state and is behind on most things.  I didn’t realize it was uncommon. Dental insurance isn’t required to have a dentist. And $600 seems cheap for the surgery. I broke a crown on a Friday night. So I get it.  But the on call system was a life saver.  I just called my dentist and the random on call offered to meet me in his office.
AdviceAnimals,ffhswxe,t1_ffhs1d6,1579952236.0,"It is ridiculous, that’s why it’s insane to go to a hospital at all, unless it’s a true emergency. Was there nothing your on call dentist could handle over the phone? Or even go into the office?  The hospital seems to be the over the top part to me."

babywearing,ffe4ve1,t3_et3tkk,1579836757.0,"Have you tried just using the pillow?  If your baby sits a bit further down in the carrier, it might offer a bit more head support. I’d also try to even him out on the pillow, he looks a little lopsided which could make his legs a bit over extended. Other than that, everything looks good. You’ll probably be able to give up the insert pretty quickly. Your baby is practically fitting knee to knee already. The infant insert usually keeps baby from slumping down but at 15 lbs, your carrier will be pretty full.  Just make sure knees are able to swing freely."

Users weren’t installing the blade correctly at all.  Silhouette modified the design with the Cameo 4.  

Have you tried updating the software?  I wonder if there’s some kind of bug making your machine not reset the blade. 
Without seeing pics/video, troubleshooting is going to be difficult. But it doesn’t sound like a user error. 
Have you contacted silhouette?  They are usually pretty oof about figuring things out. The Cameo 4 is still pretty new, so you could just be experiencing a glitch. I haven’t experienced this as an issue, and I’ve been using lots of cardstock lately as well as the sketch pens."
silhouettecutters,ffayy0b,t3_eslqq5,1579747728.0,"Another thing would be to decrease the pressure. If you are cutting cardstock, the blade may be dragging weird. Increase the blade setting instead. The pressure can only do so much without the blade being out far enough."

There are other situations, just as privately donating, where the woman would choose a donor based on a questionnaire. Oftentimes, those aren’t tested. But usually those donations aren’t given to babies that would have any concerns or are a bit older. One of those communities is Human Milk for Human Babies.

The housing prices follow this very closely, so if you do find a good house for a good price, the school may not be as desirable.

WilmingtonDE,fe5yp5j,t1_fe5akgs,1578877900.0,"Yes, but without a car, you are relying on public transportation which isn’t the most reliable. Especially if you don’t live close to the train station and have to walk more than 15-20 mins. I used to live on North campus as an AG major, that was a 45 min walk right there.

Wilmington would be more difficult to find a sublet than Newark. But the transportation would be a huge issue getting between the two.

todayilearned,fdx7kl5,t1_fdx4811,1578766070.0,"What I meant was that we know now that babies have needs more than basic necessities. More than “I’m hungry”, “I’m sleepy” or “I need a diaper change”. This was recently shared in a breastfeeding group I’m in and it’s crazy to think parents followed these directions because a medical professional passed it along. Other than smoking, none of these practices are are suggested anymore. I’ve also seen things like this that say to not hold your baby longer than so many minutes or to let your infant cry because it exercises their lungs. Neither of which is true. There’s also been research with NICU babies and how they thrive when being held which is why hospitals have switched to rooming in and being “baby friendly”.  Babies need touch, they need to be held. 
Babies who were left in orphanages stopped crying because no one came was another article I read.

If a business fails, money is lost, if a baby fails a life is lost. We’ve been raising babies since the beginning of time and believe it or not, many people are returning to the old world traditions. Things like breastfeeding, babywearing, cosleeping, “4th trimester”, cloth diapering and may others are really starting to make a resurgence in parenting communities. Many people get the “crunchy granola” label but babies are crying less. Parents are also much more aware of their needs. It seems like we got away from nurturing and raising a baby.  I often wonder if that’s why the saying “sleeping like a baby” became popular. Since any parent will tell you babies don’t sleep well at all. And there’s always some dumb ass that asks how the baby is sleeping in the first 3 months, like sleeping through the night is a good thing."

But this option would be better than the Moby for comfort. 
Would you consider posting a pic for a fit check? Wearing baby too low could be a reason for shoulder pain.

I know a few moms who extended breastfeeding without really pushing food because baby wasn’t ready so that becomes a preference. Of course, there’s always exceptions but parents can really feed into the “chicken nugget, Mac and cheese, pizza diet”. Then saying that’s all their kid will eat.

The chat function said it would be about a 50 min wait. In the end, it took about 10 mins and my issue was resolved in about 3 mins. 

Overall, I think customer service really works with you to help figure out the issues. However, it may take time. If you have a FB account and have an issue, posting to the many silhouette groups may yield you a quicker answer. Especially if you search the group. I’ve never seen an issue that only one person has had.  Even this subreddit is beginning to have more activity, the format for attaching video and images is just a bit more difficult. Especially when trying to respond."

If you look on Oracal’s website they have all the specifications include the adhesive type. I believe they have a whole line of reflective.  The hard part would be availability. You may not be able to get ahold of any in small quantities."
silhouettecutters,fdgwpie,t3_elbjwz,1578410200.0,"Oracal 5300 is reflective. They have several colors. If you press oracal with a warm iron, it does give the appearance of HTV."

Any links to the article, not DO?"
WTF,fdbctlz,t1_fdauaqm,1578256112.0,"It just seems that the maternity leave is blamed  constantly for why women can’t do it. Women are shamed in the US for choosing formula. Especially since you read that in Europe, women will breastfeed their children until they are 4. All of the reasons you stated are reasons people don’t breastfeed in the US as well.  Just seems like another way that women and mothers are shamed in the US. It’s really sad. I think if those that can’t do it for these reasons were more open about it, maybe the shaming wouldn’t be so harsh."
WTF,fd9za8f,t1_fd9wqrp,1578239812.0,I would assume that would be a much lower number than the number of women that have to return to work in the US. In the US I’ve read something like 80% of women start but don’t make it far at all.
WTF,fd9u49y,t1_fd8iw5h,1578238031.0,I kinda thought the rest of the world was more into breastfeeding than the US. With the paid maternity leave and how the US is so far behind in any aspects like that. Is that not true?  It would be devastating in the US to run out of formula.

interestingasfuck,fd7c307,t1_fd7av8j,1578202189.0,I’d hope they’d look into it a bit more. Especially if it was a common name. And they’d wonder why someone with murder charges wasn’t in prison.

Delaware,fcz1oj9,t3_ejn0y6,1578091878.0,"The odds are purely based on the number of cases that go to court. I had to go over the summer, there were 18 cases and all of them settled before a jury was needed. We ended up leaving around noon. However, if a case is actually tried and the jury is needed, you won’t know how long you will be there. If there are still cases happening, you’ll need to stay."

There would be apts all around Delaware ave. Of course, the walk would be through the woods of Alapocus which could be dicey. But Powder Mill Rd doesn’t have sidewalks so that’s not the safest either."

But yes, you can absolutely continue to wear your baby, you’ll just need another carrier. Preferably an ergonomic one, since your daughter will be big enough to be in the correct M position without any issues."
Delaware,fctfyp9,t3_eiqx0d,1577942023.0,"I don’t think you would have triggered it. We have red  light camera where Kirkwood Hwy and Limestone rd cross and it constantly goes off. Even when no one is in the intersection. However, if people were getting the actual tickets, I’m sure we’d see plenty about it either in the news, or here. If you stopped, even just across the line, you’ll be fine."
