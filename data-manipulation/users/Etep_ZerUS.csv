AmItheAsshole,ffe1t5w,t3_et2vjj,1579834483.0,"Thanks everyone for weighing in. I've received a wide range of answers, not all of which I agree with. Regardless of that, I do think that I made the correct choice at the time. I definitely should have been nicer to him about it. He ended up getting the butter himself in the end, and now he's just being mildly salty in the kitchen. Anywho, I was the asshole, and I just need to be a bit nicer. Thanks everyone"

I could have, but I wasn’t feeling like taking care of him. It’s never been my job to do that, nor did I ever ask for it to be.

Nope

I’m very sorry for your loss, and I can’t say I know exactly what it’s like to lose a brother, but I think your relationship with your brother may have been a little different than mine. I do spend time with my brother, regularly. We’re very friendly towards each other. Fights like this are barely remembered by the next day, and usually forgiven before then. I love him, and I know he loves me. Thank you for offering your advice. It means a lot to me that you would share this with the internet for a stranger’s sake. I don’t think I would change what I did, but I would certainly be nicer about it if I could try again."

As I you put it, you are saying that any rape accusation results in a conviction, regardless of if it is false or not.

I remember running a strange campaign where the party was a team of kobolds running a dungeon. The dungeon was randomly rolled, but the entrance was a pit with a rope ladder leading in. Then there was a long, winding hallway with a portcullis at the end leading to a small room. Inside that room was a gelatinous cube. 

The party was out on the town and the rogue and wizard had gotten into some mischief. The wizard posed as a merchant in the bazaar and the rogue would pickpocket people who approached the wizard. First person that came up to them was a rich and powerful gold mogul. He was a part of the family that basically owned the town, as the main source of income for it was the gold mines. The rogue picked a bag off of this dude and found  80gp worth of assorted coins and a cery fancy signet ring. We had literally just started the adventure (lvl.1) so 80 gold was a very nice find. 

Anywho, that night we were camped outside of town when we awoke to find ourselves surrounded by 15 thugs wearing the same apparel as the gold dude. Three of us managed to stealth away after creating a distraction via throwing the ring away and climbing into the trees, but the wizard failed his stealth roll and fell out of the tree. He ran from the thugs until he reached the road. There was a wagon heading towards town, so he cast fear on the driver and nicked one of his horses. He rode all the way back to the dungeon, with the thugs trailing behind him. He hides his horse and gets to the dungeon entrance just as the thugs ride up to him. 

He drops down the entrance and tuns through the halls and slams the portcullis down behind him. Thugs follow and pile up on the portcullis and begin trying to lift it. They probably would have gotten through if not for the gelatinous cube that was waiting for them in the next room. The cube slid right through the bars as the thugs all started pushing back on their allies behind them. Only about half of them could even see the cube at this point, so their allies didn’t immediately begin trying to escape. The cube began to grab the thugs and envelop them, two at a time. Most of them died from being enveloped as they failed the saves to resist, and those that didn’t die of the immediate 3d6 acid, took 6d6 next turn, which definitely killed them. The cube wiped them. Only one managed to climb out, with the cube hot on his tail. The rest of the party caught that one on the way back and merked him, as we didn’t want word getting out about the dungeon quite yet."
