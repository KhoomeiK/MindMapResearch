It is implanted under the skin in the abdomen and then does it's thing (you can google it for more info).  What you're talking about is something called looping.  Basal goes up and down based on what the connected CGM says.

Here's the thing about a pump regardless if you're looping or not.  It still takes management.  It makes life easier and more flexible but you still have to make basal decisions based on your activity, sickness, ect, ect.  Sure people can wait until their internist or endo changes their basal program but that could mean weeks or months at too high or low bg which can get dangerous.  And of course you still have to deal with your bolus (meal) insulin.  So you still have to carb count and know what your current BG is (not sure how the pumps work that connect to a cgm.. mine doesn't so I have to enter my bg manually).

Then of course there's the issue with insulin in the pump reservoir/cartridge.  A pump takes care of both basal and bolus insulin so if she's a T2 that takes A LOT of insulin to help get over the insulin resistance, the pump may not help.  Mine only holds 200u for 3 days and can't be refilled during the 3 day period if I run out.  I have to fill a new cartridge.  I think there are some that's refillable but again, someone will have to watch this and manage this.  (I know some highly insulin resistant people on pumps use the pump only for basal and still inject for bolus but this doesn't sound like an option)

Good luck with finding her a way to manage this in her elder years and you're a good person for doing this."

Take a chicken breast and pound it out.  Don't pound it so thin there's holes but it should be about .5cm.

Put a slice of ham and swiss cheese (I use emmental since swiss cheese as we know it in the states isn't easy to get in the Netherlands but you could spice it up with pepperjack too!) on the chicken then roll it up.

Wrap the chicken roll in bacon strips.  You can skip this part to lighten up the recipe a bit, I make it both ways but fan favorite is with the bacon.

Pan fry the chicken rolls in butter.  Once everything is browned on the outside you can add enough water to cover the bottom of the pan, turn the heat to low and cover it.  Let it simmer for about 20 minutes or until the chicken is completely done on the inside of the roll.

You can leave it here, or make a cream sauce.  Take the chicken out and add heavy cream to the pan with all the delicious drippings.  After the cream is heated through (turn it to about medium) add grated parmesan a little at a time until you get the desired thickness.  You can add other herbs as well.  I like adding mccormic's garlic and bell pepper to it.  Sometimes I add some beef or chicken bouillon.

You can drizzle the sauce over the chicken and whatever else on the plate.  I like eating this with either green beans or asparagus.  My husband swears the sauce deserves mashed potatoes. haha"
diabetes,feg4429,t3_eoxgaa,1579076037.0,"I think you'll find you can lower the carb in a lot of foods that your grandpa likes.  There's a keto recipes section here on reddit that has low carb/no carb alternatives.

For example meatloaf/meatballs, you can use dry Parmesan cheese instead of bread crumbs.  Then you can wrap it in bacon strips to help it hold together and keep in the moisture instead of adding a lot of ketchup, for instance.  I don't do keto anymore (did it for 9 years before my diabetes diagnosis last year) but I still prefer making it this way.

You can lighten up mashed potatoes by adding pureed cauliflower or celaric but he may not like this.  If not, then I'd make sides like this or mac and cheese a treat vs. staple.  And I'd probably make a half recipe so there isn't tons left over.

diabetes,fe7qii7,t3_entcoc,1578917991.0,"I'm in the NL as well and am using the Kaleido (only offered here and the UK at the moment) which is also a pod pump and the only competitor to the omnipod (at least here so far).

The biggest reason I went for it is it's a lot smaller than the omnipod and the infusion site is separate.  So if you have an issue with the infusion site, you can take it off w/o having to fill up a new insulin cartridge and if you have issues with the pump (runs out of battery, etc) you can change it and not the infusion site.  And the pumps are small and incredibly light.

The tubing can be as short as 5mm and then you stick the pump right next to the infusion site or if you want to wear it in your pocket, clipped to your belt, in your bra (for those that wear them), etc you can get the longer 15mm tubing.  You can also choose between a 6 and 9mm cannula.

The control is via handset (PDM) that looks like an ipod nano.  Pretty intuitive and easy to use.  You get 2 pumps, one to wear and one to charge.  The insulin cartridge officially lasts 3 days and at the 72 hour mark you start getting notifications that you've been wearing it for 3 days.  You can go about a half day more before it turns off and forces you to change (if you have plenty of insulin left you can change the cartridge over to the new pump, say it's a new cartridge and use it but you have to keep track with how much is left yourself).

The cartridges are currently 200u and when you hit 50u it alerts you that you're getting low.  

Much less important is you get to choose the colors of your pumps and pdm.

The company is VERY communicative and I've enjoyed working with them so far.  In fact, my handset killed one of my pumps and then committed suicide while I was in Orlando on holiday (if you're going on holiday you can request a vacation kit with 2 pumps and a handset in case anything goes wrong) and i had to break open the spare pumps.  I had my new pump at my door 2 on the monday after I got home (arrived back in the NL on friday).

I did keto 9 years, was diagnosed while eating keto and after diagnosis something changed.  If I don't eat over 70g net carbs and go into ketosis (I can slide into ketosis between 50 and 60g) my liver will start mass producing and dumping glucose and keep my bg between 8 and 9 fasting easily."

diabetes,fdq400v,t1_fdozbe2,1578653765.0,"I started first with the CGM setup while I was still MDI.  I started purchasing freestyle libres (out of pocket) and paired it with a miaomiao for CGM and alarm capability.  On my android I have the numbers sent to the app xdrip+ and then I can also see my numbers on my fitbit versa.  This was the beginning of being able to be confident in the gym again and not have some wicked hypos or have to ruin my whole workout mood by pulling out the glucose meter.

Unfortunately I found out that for high cardio activities like hiking and cycling (even kayaking on canals w/o any current) MDI sucked.  Either I gave myself enough basal to cover the hyper through the night (wicked dawn phenomenon that left me drained) but constantly have to eat to keep from going low through the day and kiss exercise goodbye, or I backed off the basal on days I was going to work out or go do something.  This meant waking up with a wicked high blood sugar headache and feeling like crap and then crazy blood sugar if I had to skip working out or the activity for some reason.  And then there was the fact I love cycling.  Even backing off the basal to the safe minimum provided by my internist, I couldn't get more than 7km from the house before the journey to hell started.

That's what made me decide pretty quickly I wanted to try a pump for the basal control.  Unfortunately the pump I chose is called the kaleido (a pod pump) and it's only currently available in the Netherlands or UK.  It still uses an infusion set but you can choose a 5mm or 15mm tube.  With the 5mm you just stick the pump next to the infusion site and its so light you forget about it.  If this wasn't available I'd have gone for the omnipod because I didn't want long tubing, I just could see the issues with pulling it out at the gym or something.

End of day, if I planned to go to the gym in the morning and set a basal profile to start lowering my insulin 3 hours before so I didn't have too much on board and decided to skip, I could just correct and then change to my non exercise day profile.  Or if I decide at the spur of the moment to go out kayaking, I can immediately set my temp basal down to start getting rid of the insulin on board so I don't hypo out on the water.

Unfortunately I still haven't figured out cycling yet but I haven't really been able to get out since I got my pump back in August."

For me, it was the opposite.  I go really high at night due to a really strong dawn phenomenon but then I struggled with keeping my bg up from about noon till 1am.  Then if I even thought about exercise, I was completely screwed.

I went ahead and broke up my basaglar to 2 injections and that helped a little but not enough for leg day, cycling, hiking or kayaking.  If I was planning leg day the next day, or to say go out on a 10km mountain hike, I'd scale back my night time dose to 6u (the safe minimum my internist gave me) and skip the morning injection.

Now with my pump I can jack up my basal the hour before the DP starts and then gradually lower it until it's at its lowest during the day (I'm at the minimum basal between 1am and about 7pm since I'm really sensitive during these hours).
