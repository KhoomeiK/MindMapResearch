I'll admit, I've felt suicidal before as I've had no one to help and constantly seen men being belittled by others because they show emotion made me not open up for years on end I learned to rely on myself for support more so after my ex basically dropped me when my dad died and ignored me 2 weeks prior to me ending it, I broke it off due to her cheating, that ruined me for 2 years, only 2 months ago I decided to try dating again to avail, I had no support and no one to lean on, I had to pick myself up, yet again cause of this fucked up society that believes men should be strong and not show emotion I say *fuck you* to that anyone who believes that are as bad as those who believe women should be in the kitchen, it's not equal at all and fucks up men's mental and emotional state to the point they kill themselves because they've got no one else to turn and have no support but myself

I'm a bit of an asshole though, if a vegan says ""go vegan"" and constantly pesters me I'd say

""No, I'd take meat feast pizza over rabbit food anyway and another thing, a vegan tried meat for a month and said she's never felt healthier* and another thing, I will remain a meat eater and I will outlive you easily so fuck off with your vegan shite and leave people alone, someone will end up knocking you out one day you know where will your vegan diet be then.."" 

I just hate those that pester or stick their noses in because what I eat or drink is ""UnHeaLtHy"" like keep your giant pinocchio nose out of my business you moody, entitled, giant nose, twatsicle

Glad you managed to figure it out and change for the better, mate, I don't know you but I'm proud you was able to turn your life around that takes a lot of strength"
AskReddit,ff86vdn,t3_es5sb8,1579667676.0,"During dark times where I felt like I couldn't go on, wanted to end the pain and be free from it

What stopped me was myself, part of me, the Light side if you will, stepped in and said ""no, you're destined for more, don't give up when the fighting gets hard, push, damn it""

It basically yelled at me to keep fighting, pushing for greatness and saying suicide wouldn't fix anything but cause more pain and sadness, I pushed eventually it was difficult, sure, but I was able to push my Darkness out and came out stronger because of it

 If anyone reading this is suicidal rn, don't let it consume you, fight and push, and push hard, you're better than the Darkness, those demons fighting you? Laugh at them, take what they say and throw it back at them, YOU are the ones that control your destiny, YOU are the ones that decide what happens not life, not anyone else but YOU, you are here for a goddamn reason, I know it's easier said than done but FIGHT, you're stronger than you think

Become Legend, forge your own fate

AskMen,ff86b27,t3_es61jg,1579667202.0,"Your story is a tough one

Since you like a her a lot and have a lot in common but you dont find her attractive via pictures (can I ask what it is?)

Now, my mind isn't run off looks and I can be attracted to any type of body but there's limits

Personally, what I'd do is take it slow, maybe when you meet you might find her sexy, idk but if you aren't attracted to her, sexually, maybe sit her down and say you dont want to fuck up the friendship or be honest but gentle 

At the same time however if you want more then take it slow and allow ""love"" to take hold if it develops that far 

The other comments make a lot of sense and are great tips but ask yourself this:

Is she someone you can see having a future?

Can I look past what I find unattractive and focus in what i find attractive? 

Really question yourself and her"

Also, downloading porn will do that to your phone, stop doing that bro 

Also also, I've compared specs and it's fairly obvious that the Android is better due to flexibility and the iPhone is made of cheap crap, why do you think it breaks so easily, not including the fact its stupidly overpriced"
