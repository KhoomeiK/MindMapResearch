xxfitness,ff3192y,t1_ff2ra8n,1579530989.0,I really appreciate how clearly you wrote this out. Thank you!
IAmA,feync7j,t1_fey2qi3,1579447919.0,I’m sorry to hear about your grandfather.
airforceots,fepcx66,t3_eox858,1579317438.0,"Same as commenter above. 

You would probably want to trim it during OTS too just to make sure it never gets longer than your collar but you get privileges to get hair cuts to remain in regs quickly. 

But again, you pt in a ponytail."
airforceots,fe5vtqm,t1_fe5f2hc,1578876076.0,Good luck!
airforceots,fe5vrzz,t1_fe4rttw,1578876044.0,Agreed. I arrived at the start of the window of arrival time for 19-07 and we only got yelled at longer.
airforceots,fe5vpcf,t1_fe4wh4h,1578875997.0,It should be written on your orders on the back. That’s where t was located on mine that I was allocated a night.
airforceots,fe0fp58,t1_fe02tf9,1578812646.0,"Good luck! 

At this point my only suggestion is to buy some blister bandaids. If you don’t use them, someone in your flight will be so grateful you have them!!"
xxfitness,fdw6dqf,t1_fdvhy1g,1578755501.0,I got Blinc for my wedding (available at Sephora). It forms little tubes around your lashes. It’s super cool. But doesn’t flake!
airforceots,fdw5ieo,t3_en8dds,1578755313.0,If no one can provide you one in 24 hours let me know (traveling currently). I think I have a digital copy from 19-07.
airforceots,fdng22p,t1_fdncua0,1578585041.0,"During our time (19-07) laundry was a shit show so you could only do t once a week. Because of that I only kept one of everything in the drawers. If you can do laundry more often, you can keep more clothes in the drawers and just wash your clothes more."
AirForce,fdmt0nc,t1_fdm0m4x,1578564335.0,There was a post about this recently on r/airforceots
DogsWithPensions,fdl6jm0,t1_fdi8b00,1578517899.0,"Doesn’t the double first letter mean that he’s been trained since birth at ummm a base in Texas I forgot. 

That is so cool!"
airforceots,fdht420,t1_fdfrrmh,1578429667.0,I agree with this guy ^
xxfitness,fddjfzq,t1_fdc30cg,1578314685.0,Thank you!
assholedesign,fdc5gnv,t1_fdbfosu,1578267476.0,Have you see the dried fish treats? I started using them in japan. They smell awful but tasty for furry friends
xxfitness,fdc2d2o,t1_fdc0r80,1578265731.0,Are single leg squats the same as pistol squats?
xxfitness,fdc2b35,t1_fdc1040,1578265699.0,"I actually just started doing this! It was fine all together when I was lifting light, but now that it’s heavy, I have two leg days so I can break up the heavy squat and heavy deadlift. Thanks for the feedback!!!"
aww,fdbym97,t1_fdbmwzb,1578263929.0,"Carrying can be dangerous in snow like this. You can’t be sure there isn’t ice under and you could both end up hurt. While it looks silly, it’s pretty safe to do t this way."
xxfitness,fdbxzoi,t3_ekgjhl,1578263591.0,"What should be in my leg workout? 

I’m worried that it’s not well-rounded. 

Right now I do squats, deadlifts, stuff legged dead lifts, goblet squat, calf raises and hip thrusts. 
It’s a good workout and gets be tired, but is there anything you think I am missing?"
aww,fd5iovg,t1_fd5b5z9,1578178003.0,The dogs probably have stuffed animals that are these characters. That is definitely probable.
aww,fd5i88i,t1_fd57zd4,1578177933.0,He probably has a stuffed toy that is Stitch that he loves.
xxfitness,fd3nkmf,t1_fd3l6xo,1578160020.0,"Before I went to basic for the Air Force in August in Alabama, I got some underarmour hipster panties that were ridiculously expensive. 
However, they are so comfortable. Like you’re not wearing anything."
airforceots,fcvge0b,t1_fcvbvex,1578001537.0,19-07 here. I thought we had to write a special mfr to get protein approved and standardized for our class. It wasn’t an automatic from the beginning but a privilege.
airforceots,fcmjwqq,t1_fckdieg,1577778293.0,This was a huge problem for our Godzilla class. The laundry machines were swamped so I was glad I had all five pairs
airforceots,fcl5rxh,t3_ehm4dv,1577740414.0,"Two laundry bags so you can hide your clean clothes in one bag inside the dirty laundry bag. Then you don’t have to fold your clothes as often. 

I also brought a travel towel that I actually used then hid."
airforceots,fcl5lg2,t3_ehm4dv,1577740304.0,I used my microfiber cloth a surprising amount for dorm inspections. Also squeegee for the shower for dorm inspections but they might have enough acquired in the dorm storage room by now.
airforceots,fcl5il9,t3_ehm4dv,1577740255.0,A small “dumb” watch with an alarm. Like the cheap Casio ones. I set my alarm to go off at 4:15 and started getting ready in the dark. It made my mornings a lot better.
airforceots,fcl5ebg,t3_ehm4dv,1577740182.0,"Earplugs and face mask! 

I had dick roommates that stayed up late and left the light on. 

I also loved having two pairs of boots. I wore both in before I went. Got zero blisters and had dry boots to change into when I fell into water on some of the courses. 

I also packed blister bandaids which a lot of other people used."
airforceots,fcl55ui,t1_fck1g1m,1577740038.0,I will agree the ponchos are nasty but my unit bought me rain gear as soon as OTS was over so I was glad I didn’t buy it.
sandiego,fcjhzqz,t1_fchps80,1577688325.0,"When I did it, it wasn’t as painful as I thought it would be. Like a normal blood draw. I brought a friend with me because I was nervous and that was so helpful!"
sandiego,fchob12,t1_fcgzv0r,1577652368.0,Thank you for sharing!
sandiego,fcho7hy,t1_fchfz22,1577652330.0,I love that idea!!

airforceots,fce00ew,t3_eh1esf,1577615480.0,1. Ask about the safe file transfer system. It used to be SafeAmrDec system which was a website that let you send files encrypted to your recruiter but I think they recently changed what system they use.
airforceots,fc6g16h,t3_egad6k,1577479708.0,Def get the women’s blouse also. It’s cut better!!
