When the oompa loompas were firmly established they started grabbing more power away from Wonka. Eventually Wonka locked the doors to contain the oompa loompas within the factory to protect the world from their chemical and biological experiments. 

It took untill the time of the Golden ticket to quell the oompa loompa rebellion. That's when Wonka, weak and weary from injuries suffered in the rebellion, decided he needed a successor. The purpose of the Golden ticket contest was the truth...to find a strong disciplined child who could take over. The unspoken part was the winner needed to be mentally resilient to deal with the horrors the winner will face in the oompa loompas.
