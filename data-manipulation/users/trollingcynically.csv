Considering my confusion, the party referred me to the forum.  It made me sad.  It would have been nice to find a place to reaffirm my beliefs and find some consolation.  Just like my experience in ""putting myself out there,"" (whatever the fuck that is supposed to mean) looking to the internet for any kind of support structure is rather... I should say utterly, useless.  It would be nice to talk with some trained and paid professionals, but hey, this is America.

Also, these comic is shit in context with the genders assigned to the characters by the cartoon creators.  I guess you can look at it in any other context just as you would look at http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/van-gogh-boots-1886-granger.jpg and assume that it was not simply a study on two boots that struck the artist as something interesting to paint in his time living with the peasants of France.  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Vincent_Van_Gogh_-_The_Potato_Eaters.png  

[context] Yeah, I know, art history etc.  I liked it so I am using it as an example.  That came from an art class in middle school where we were told to read a little too much into the work of artists without enough context to make a sound judgement.  I did some studies like this where i painted something that looked cool so I painted it (poorly)[/context]

The point is that without proper context the comic is so confusing as to render it almost useless.  Put some tags over the characters next time OP.  Without context your message is instinctively misconstrued by much of the broad population.

Non sequitur and/or a straw man of the upper middle class Bay Park Neighborhood. Why hate on Bay Park?  How about the people in all the other neighborhoods that hate them?  You live in a 2 bedroom downtown.  They are in the same income brackets as yourself.  Those places are not cheap.

I wish I could afford to work down town and I wish I would have approached my life a little differently in retrospect.  Blue collar values and outlook as was taught to me.  I am making more money now but it is very expensive to live down town so without making 70-80k a year it seems extravagant.  I live a little more spartanly so as to try and met the goals in my life. Living down town is such a luxury because you an just walk everywhere.  I walk to the grocery store all the time.  It is now closer than it was before I moved.  Even more than a mile and change was a common walk.  When I was poor I did it.  I am not as poor now and I still do it.  I learned how to be thrifty and frugal from those who were well off more recently and had survived the depression in the lower and middle classes.  Walking is a good thing.  Carbon neutral too.  I get the want for a human lifestyle like we saw in Wally. I bet you even ride the scooter on the sidwalk like some cretin.  Do you ride or encourage others to ride their bikes on the sidewalk as well? 

Is there any scooter journeys that can not be done with a brisk walk?  Does a brisk walk make you sweaty?  If you don't have enough space for a bike that you would use for short trips to the grocery store, bodega, casual dining out (since you will no doubt budget for this), maybe you should get rid of some of the shit in your tiny place.  I am not suggesting you wear a suit on your bike.  I have done it when I needed to.  If you don't need to then fine, take a walk, take a train ride, etc.  Why do you hate public transit so much?  Please, do yourself and everyone else a favor and go to Washington D.C. and see how transit is supposed to work.  It is a great experience.  Maybe you will hate it anyway.

So sorry we took your recorder away.  Now it is time to find some harmonica, a plastic ukulele, a bongo drum.  There are a million piccolo substitutions for those with no training.  

Sometimes good ideas don't work out.  I bet that you have seen some poorly implemented programs to help those less fortunate than myself.  I bet you worked on something different after that became the case.  Scooters didn't work out.  Let's try doing something like ditching some parking for more public transit.  I know, I know, you love your car so much.  It wil only hurt for a little while.  It is like losing a pet.  You will always remember but move on."

IT is like you forget where most of our electricity comes from.  No hydro, too little solar and one wind farm at the farthest east part of the county.  Still burning methane if nothing else.  Cleaner.  Go get a bike for 15 block transport you lardass.

>But, people who are allegedly concerned for ""safety"" use that as an excuse to get rid of them

It is a concern of safety for people not riding the scooters.  Scooter riders were part of the problem.  Too bad, oh well, tough shit if we hurt people with our toy 10 block transport.  Bad behavior was not checked and allowed to fester for the last tow years.  people ruined it for you.  Maybe I have a vendetta because some idiot broke my toe a month before vacation leaving me out of work for a month. https://i.imgur.com/zdAh7UI.gif

So the market spoke because these things were obnoxious. edit: It was a loss making venture.  I am sorry that you chose a good gig and now you will not be able to post the things up in all sorts of obnoxious places after you charged them.  Less stress on the grid in the summer time.  Please don't try to act like the public backlash was about change.  The backlash was due to people being injured by scooter drivers.  Peoples property was destroyed by scooter drivers.  Lack of any kind of oversight after problems were identified after more than two years of trying out this idea.  Regulation comes into effect when people do bad things.  If folks stopped doing bad things to each other then there would be less regulation.

>Sorry, you just can't force people to do things they don't want to do--at least not with the same success of something they enjoy doing

Just like you are forced to commute to work any other way?  I fucking hate sitting in traffic to go to work too.  I am forced to do this because the population of west coast cities can't seem to figure out how to make public transit work.  I promise it really isn't all that bad if it is implemented correctly. Walking places is very hard in SD.  Rail is pathetically designed.  OMG!  Poor people are so yucky!  go fuck off and work in Seattle then.  Much less of it up there.  Get over it.  Go work in LA, NYC, DC, Miami, Houston, Dallas, Boston etc.  You will find poor yucky people there too."

As a non angry white guy, I can see an offhanded bit of sarcasm and snark thrown in with the whiff of truth that you see as a whiff of putrescence.  I personally have seen from evidence and have seen (anecdotally) how this is a thing.  This context has no shaming of white folk.  This is a post about some shitlord, quite possibly like yourself, who got away with doing some very shitty things. That very shitlord faced few repercussions. You sure are edgy about being a white guy.  You don't laugh at Southpark  when the skin slider chooses the difficulty level?  Man, you need a little more humor in your life.

Buy it to train for all the other cool ships that the other races have.  I can't tell you how much fun so many of the ship types and fits I have used over the years.  I guess I am partial to combat so that is my $.01.  Industry is locked away behind the paywall.  Industry is fun too.  I have 2 independent accounts which mostly stay subbed one at a time.  Both are fun for the specialization I have built them to.  Sometimes I just want to take a break from hard core face melting fights and do some indy, carebear crabbing and exploration.  I can do some of that on the other toon, but not nearly as well.  I have friends in a lot of places over all of the years so they know who the toons are at this point.  Spying is hard with just an alpha.  Spying is out of the question for me now, but it was pretty cool and you will have fuck all luck for most covert operations (ships included however I am talking about social interactions here) since any fuckwad can make an alpha account and spy with an alpha if they want to bust the eula.  Good luck getting anywhere with an alpha because no one will trust you with any useful information as an alpha.  If you are content fucking about in FW fighting in t1 cruisers and frigates, keep on plunking around on your alpha account.  It sounds like you are not.  Go buy some game time and figure it out.  After taking a long break from eve, I had none of the cool ships with an alpha account.  No Tengu, no Sin, no Vindicator, no Guardian, no Vagabond, no Lachesis, no Archon, no Taranis, no Curse, you get the point.  Those are ships that I had a liking to however I can fly almost all the things in between.  You can't do that with an alpha clone.  Even the wait for SP for the next ship on the list was something to look forward to.  This was a small driving factor for me for many years.  Just a few more days til I can bomb around in a Vagabond!  Another week and I will have T2 neuts for my Bhaal!  Exploration was a ton of fun, and so was plastering together stuff with the loot."
