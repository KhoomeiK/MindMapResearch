vegan,ffayepm,t3_esgjmf,1579747373.0,I like how they've accepted that cat will cat.

vegan,ff93m21,t1_ff8o2bd,1579704024.0,That's not universally true. They could be students who live with their family and pack lunch from home. Meals are usually an established/traditional recipe so it's not like they're about to get Beyond Meat for lunch.

india,fezsopa,t1_fex7g0t,1579461151.0,"Yeah, a lot of people here act like they've not lived in India. People very freely ask you questions about things that don't concern them. If that person refused to deliver food that's a different discussion but OP got his food. To expect delivery drivers to be drones or machine men is quite classist."
india,feznik7,t1_feycoov,1579459349.0,It's your choice alone only if you don't offer cows moral consideration. Would you be okay if a cattle farmer abuses their cows?
india,fezmngz,t1_fex82cu,1579459060.0,There's no additional cost to going Vegan. It can be much cheaper if you aren't lazy and get your ingredients in bulk. I'll just say let's all be more guarded against misinformation.

india,feezhac,t1_fecpovx,1579044641.0,"What's worse about Veganism, and why do you think it won't work in India? How can people who already go hungry because of poverty afford something more expensive. Is your calculation perhaps that if there's more food available, then the average price should go down. By that logic, if there's more Vegan food available, then the average would go down even further just because the former is more expensive.  


P.S. Yes there are models that suggest that a predominantly plant based food supply with a small % of ruminants (because they can digest plant matter we can't) would be more efficient than just 100% plant based food supply."
aww,fedh3zl,t1_fed5oar,1579011359.0,Definitely the filming and the unabashed consumption of it. But other than that I don't know
RagnarokOnline,fecgzv5,t1_faijfm0,1578973700.0,Playing Hunter was the worst. On any map with a lot of churn something would appear from thin air and swat you dead.
india,fe355r6,t1_fe11y8d,1578846042.0,Good point. Even better if you can eat stuff that is kinder to the environment.

Austin,fdu0nd3,t1_fds9pq6,1578725406.0,I love the Arlo's BBQ burger. Both Beer Plant and Bistro Vonish make pretty good BBQ sandwiches as a sidenote.
india,fdqv1eo,t1_fdno8p5,1578675227.0,"By that logic we don't need any checks and balances because (in an ideal world) everyone would show up and do their jobs. The leadership of all 4 pillars, unfortunately, aren't immune to the political winds that gust through the corridors of power. It's better, imo, to seek to understand it than to wish it away."
Showerthoughts,fdogc3h,t3_emcc3n,1578604579.0,Easy fix is to make it a record of being the earliest born that's living.
india,fdnfhu4,t1_fdmuhzs,1578584699.0,"Perhaps it's not so simple. If the current SC makes unpopular decisions, they give the government political fuel to go after judicial reforms. Why would they volunteer to do it?"
india,fdhogth,t1_fdhgv89,1578426963.0,"Good point, but if you don't agree with what Nestle does, then you should vote with your wallet and buy from a more ethical company. It's a slippery slope fallacy to suggest that one has to apply the same remedy to *world problems* that they do to their snacking choices.    


Edit add: CCTV access should be locked down and viewing them with an intent to surveil should need some reasonable check like a court order."
india,fdhduma,t1_fdh2ww8,1578420596.0,"Shouldn't people calculate their moves though? It's only when they don't calculate they go beating up others with rods and what not  


Edit: This was a comment made in jest. Not trying to deny that goons aren't coordinated, and definitely not trying to say that their actions are just an innocent lack of calculations."
india,fdhc5ym,t1_fdgrh2o,1578419758.0,"Well, I didn't like that he was very silent either (but it's not my style to call names, or insult anyone).  I'll also admit that I never had to be scared about it."
