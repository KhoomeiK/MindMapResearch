Let's just say, for the sake of argument, there were 100 billion Necrontyr when they went from fleshy bodies to necrodermis ones. Out of that 100bn, how many were of a leadership ""caste"" or role? A million, two million? Compared to the total of 100bn, that's what I would call ""a select few.""

PleX,fehczby,t3_ep67op,1579114008.0,"Very few. The ""tube"" model only has 2GB of RAM instead of 3GB, has 8GB of internal storage instead of 16GB (though it's offset by an onboard microSD card slot), and is running a 32-bit version of Android instead of 64-bit. 

Of those changes, the storage and less RAM would be my two biggest concerns. If you're going to run a Plex server off your Shield, you will pretty much have to use a microSD card or a USB device to handle the storage. Also, the loss of 1GB of RAM might cause performance issues at some point down the road. There are a few apps that don't have 32-bit versions anymore, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to check the apps you want to use and make sure they support 32-bit Android. Just my personal opinion, take it for whatever it is or isn't worth to you, but if you can afford the extra 50USD or so for the Pro model, I'd go that route just to hedge your bets. It also leaves the door open for the possibility of using your Shield for things like retro gaming."

Still, I would recommend at least filing an internal complaint and then offer to retract that claim if the professor writes you a recommendation letter and maybe even helps get you a job somewhere else.

To add a new quality level, such as Emerald or Prismatic for example, would likely require altering the code for the base game, and it's not open source. Would be nice if ConcernedApe developed Stardew Valley similarly to Linux, where he gets to decide what does and doesn't make it into the game, but it's his game, so he gets to decide how he wants to run things.

What you could probably do to work around it was create new items that were all named ""Emerald <Something>"" and had a higher base selling price.

PleX,feduf9n,t3_eon0h1,1579020118.0,"h/x265 is just a better quality encoding method. The very (very) simplified version is that where x264 and other codecs all use unified block sizes for encoding, x265 will use variable block sizes. Take your credit roll at the end of a movie for example. The actual text will be split into much smaller blocks while the black surrounding it is made up of much larger blocks. That is the primary way in which x265 achieves better compression without sacrificing quality. The tradeoff is it requires a lot more hardware power to encode/decode, but these days almost everything supports x265 hardware decoding because it's the official bluray video codec.

If you're going to reencode a massive amount of content, make sure you do it with something that supports hardware accelerated x265 encoding or you will likely be at it for months."

depression,fecnmdq,t3_eofm2a,1578978448.0,"I don't think either of those places are really going to give you what you want, unfortunately. ERs and Urgent Care places don't generally do prescriptions that require refills, and that's exactly what antidepressants are. The ER will likely just refer you to outpatient services you've already looked into, and probably won't give you the medical referral you need/want. Same thing for Urgent Care. They don't want to deal with anything that can't be addressed in 1-2 visits.

Best thing I can think of to suggest is calling your new doctor's office and letting the receptionist know that if someone cancels an appointment you would like them to call you to see if you could make it in. Other than that, check for any NAMI branches in your area, as they could probably help point you towards resources in your area. Maybe also look into support groups you could attend. Just little stopgap measures that will help until you can get in to see someone.

You can try some of the homeopathic type treatments such as turmeric supplements and adopting a keto diet. The evidence for them is purely anecdotal, but even if you get a placebo effect for a couple weeks it's something. There are also online therapy services.

In the last 2-3 pages of the second book of the opening trilogy of the Heresy series, after Horus has sided with Chaos, there's a very brief mention of how he talked to Russ about Magnus and got him all riled up. Not much of a challenge since Russ already hated Magnus and sorcery. About the only one who might have been even more brutal was Mortarian.

The primarchs were always a means to an end, just like the Thunder Warriors before them. They most likely had no real place in the Imperium after the webway project was finished.

Otherwise... Cymbalta is a SNRI, so other drugs in that category would include Effexor/Venlafaxine and Pristiq/Desvenlafaxine. Either of which she should be able to switch to without needing to first taper off the Cymbalta. She'll need to talk to her doctor about that.

Just as an example, I remember a story once about some guy who was arrested multiple times for molesting young kids. During a MRI, they found a benign tumor in his brain that was pressing up against parts of the brain associated with impulse control. They removed the tumor and his desire to molest kids went away. Something similar ***could*** be the case with your boyfriend. 

Keep in mind I'm not a doctor or a therapist, I just know enough to be dangerous on both counts. It certainly couldn't hurt to ask the doctor to order a scan of your boyfriend's brain to make sure there isn't a tumor or cyst or something that might be the result of his issues, but don't be too surprised if they don't find anything. Otherwise, I'd say it sounds like some kind of dissociative disorder. Probably not full-blown multiple personality/dissociative identity, which is extremely rare, but something along those lines. But again, if an actual licensed professional thinks it's something else, go with them over me."

ShieldAndroidTV,fdzxmak,t1_fdzvd90,1578798284.0,"If a replacement unit exhibits the same behavior, I would turn my attentions to external factors, such as the power feeding the unit. There's a chance the power being supplied is not the steady 112V that is expected and may have a number of dips and surges. You could try introducing a UPS to boost dips with some battery power and trim the surges. A spontaneously rebooting device *usually* means there's not enough power to keep the unit running, but it could be caused by several other things as well.

If inserting a UPS unit solves the issue, I would strongly suggest hiring an electrician to come out and give the wiring in the house a quick once over. It could very well be a fire hazard that could burn the place to the ground at any time. It might also just be that your local power company is the one that needs to repair/replace some of their equipment.

Purely anecdotal, but I have my Shield connected directly to a UPS that does automatic voltage regulation, and it's stable as can be. Same with all the other equipment I have attached to it."

Either the power supply is bad or it's overheating would be my top two guesses for what's wrong. There are a few other possibilities, but they all lead back to ""defective unit"" in the end.

It happens with modern manufacturing methods. There's a variability in the quality of the raw materials which then leads to variability in the quality of every level up to the finished good. When you're making thousands of units every day, you can't test each and every one, so you do statistical sampling. You test X number of units out of Y produced and are then able to say there's like a 95% certainty that all the units are good if the tested ones pass. Obviously there's still some margin for error in there and bad units will make it into the wild. One of which you seem to have had the (mis)fortune of getting. This is what warranties are for. Contact nVidia, and have them send you a replacement. Unless you're still within the return period wherever you bought it, in which case you can just request a replacement from them."

We only really have descriptions of it happening to the legions present at Istvaan III and V, but it makes sense that the others would have done the same. Some may well have managed to survive. 

Probably the best case scenario would be the warriors would be quietly absorbed into some loyalist Chapter to replenish their ranks after a particularly disastrous campaign and the Chapter then is just very careful to make sure none of the ""traitor"" gene-seed is sent back in tithe shipments, and the Apothecaries of the Chapter are sworn to secrecy.

I can't claim to know a great deal about how SMAPI works as far as interfacing with the XNA SDK to allow the use of hardware accelerated filters, or even if the XNA SDK allows for hardware accelerated graphics filters at all, but it just has the appearance of being a software rendered filter from my observations.

One suggestion might be to talk to the person at the client company and send them copies of emails, texts, and whatever other physical documentation you have so s/he could go to their HR department and maybe get some kind of exception to hire you directly or go through a different agency, and also start the process of severing ties with this current temping place.

Other than that, I would name and shame this temping agency if it were me. Throw up a website with copies of all the physical evidence you have and maybe pay for some google adwords to show up when people search for that company's name. 

You can also look to see if the company lists the names of its board of directors and start contacting them with copies of your correspondence with the CEO. He might find himself in need of a staffing agency's help afterwards, because this sounds like it's a pattern of behavior that he's been doing for a while now, and has likely cost the company plenty of other commissions for placing people. Companies will often overlook a lot of ""eccentric"" behavior on the part of top execs right up until it starts affecting the bottom line. At that point they will very often decide enough is enough and toss the person out on their ass. Usually companies have a pretty predictable pattern for how email addresses are derived, so all you really need are their names.

Anyway, for whatever it is or isn't worth given I'm just a random person on the Internet... sorry that happened to you. I've been out of work for over 2 years now, so can empathize with the idea of having something dangled in front of you only to be yanked away at the last second.

40kLore,fds7pv7,t3_emrs8z,1578696245.0,"I think for the most part, there was something of a predisposition to follow ANY primarch, but they felt a particular affinity with their own. In the Beast Arises series, Vulkan is leading a bunch of Imperial Fists, and in the Dark Imperium Guiliman is leading all of the Chapters based on the original legions.

I'm not exactly a military person, so forgive me if my terminology is a bit off... but think of it maybe a bit like an Army soldier who runs into a Navy Admiral. Technically the Admiral has no authority over the Army person, but you can damn well bet that they're going to salute and call them Sir just because it's so ingrained into them after basic training. Plus, knowing that a primarch could end you before you even knew what was happening, and there's basically no accountability for them in that regard, will likely also keep you from getting too far out of line.

Also, post-heresy, space marines are literally brainwashed into serving the Imperium. It's part of the hypnoindoctrination all neophytes go through which was intended to keep them loyal."

* RegenMod which will regen health and energy over time, though I set it pretty low
* ObjectTimeLeft so you have some idea when a machine/tap will finish
* Lookup Anything to reduce the number of times I have to leave the game and check the wiki for something
* UI Info Suite which just provides a few useful additions, like reminders for someone's birthday, queen of sauce, and the traveling merchant. Just be sure to turn off the villager locations unless you like duplicate icons on the map
* WearMoreRings which increases the number of rings you can have to 6
* TreeTransplant so I can move fruit trees around if I want
* AutoAnimalDoors which opens/closes the barn/coop doors every day
* AutomaticGates so you don't have to manually open gates or remember to close them
* AnimalSitter (there's an unofficial patch) where you pay a fictional farmhand or your spouse/kid to pet/milk/sheer your animals and collect eggs 
* Grass Growth Adjuster which can save a lot of hassle with pigs that eat a metric shittonne of grass
