photoshop,ff9vm33,t3_esf8ea,1579722473.0,"PS refers to width and height as dimensions, while you may see these referred to as ""resolution"" elsewhere. Use whatever dimensions you need to get the job done. Personally, I use a canvas size where I can comfortably draw linework with an 8px brush, and scale down the image during export. The default round brush is fussy below 4px, and there's an annoying jump in size from 10 to 15px when using the [ and ] hotkeys for changing brush size.

Pixels have no arbitrary size. Photoshop can set a PPI (pixels/inch) value for resolution, not DPI (dots/inch). This affects few things within PS itself: relative font sizes, sizing of placed images, any other measurements based on non-pixel units. Resolution mainly affects how large an image will print, but printers may ignore PS' value and use their own (e.g. borderless printing, fit to page).

It is common to see images with 72 ppi, even though it has no actual effect when viewing on a screen. Handheld prints are often made at 300 ppi. You can use less resolution for works meant to be viewed from farther away, such as posters or billboards. I usually start with 480 ppi, 8×4.5 inches to start at 4k and scale down to full HD.

PS cannot directly control how toner/ink dots are placed on a page, and so has no use for any DPI (dots/inch) value. Printers specify DPI, and you generally want more DPI than PPI to get smoother, more detailed prints."

photoshop,fejbklb,t1_feivhfm,1579165756.0,"In my experience, it's just a tough job. The Brush tool takes a lot of training (and a graphics stylus) to do well. The Pen tool is great at sharp lines, but also tedious when you need a lot of linework. If you have Illustrator (or Inkscape), it might be easier to just do linework there.

If you're sticking with Photoshop, I do recommend scaling up your work, and scaling back down to final size during export. Brush strokes clean up very well, and paths are easier to work with when you have more space.

For complex linework, scaling up also gives the ""Create work path from selection"" command a better chance. In the Channels panel, you can Ctrl+click the composite (RGB) channel to get a selection of the bright parts of the image. Invert this selection, convert it to a work path using the Paths panel, and use Layer > New Fill Layer > Solid Color to trace the linework. This may work better if you increase the contrast (or slap on a Threshold adjustment layer). You can also Alt+click ""Create work path"" to set a tighter Tolerance value.

The Paint Bucket tends to be horrible at its own job, because it usually leaves a thin edge uncolored, especially with black-on-white linework. It also likes to escape out of any gaps it finds, and can obliterate similar colors if you make Tolerance too loose.

Lately I've taken to creating shapes for the *fill* color I want to use, copy the vector mask to a line layer underneath, and expand the path to get a nice variable stroke around the shape. You can add another line layer on top, or cut into the fill layer with the Pen tool set to ""Subtract front shape"" operation. So the ""line"" layer ends up being a slightly larger shape than the fill layer. You can clip mask other layers on top to give more character to the fill layer (and/or the line layer).

The Pen tool can be used in ""Shape"" mode to automatically create a filled layer. If you want a fixed-width stroke, use the toolbar to add one—this particular stroke is superior to any other that PS can create for you (Stroke layer style, Edit > Stroke, Stroke Path). Make sure to find the setting that lets you place the stroke outside, inside, or centered on the path."

photoshop,fehojex,t3_ep21xk,1579120724.0,"1\.
Paths have their own panel, and do not directly exist as layer content. By default you create a ""work path"", which can be used as a guide-like base for filling, stroking, creating a precise selection, or as a baseline for the Type tool. You can also attach a path to a layer as a ""vector mask"", where it acts like a layer mask. Layers can have both layer masks and vector masks. If you use the Pen or Shape tools in ""Shape"" mode, they will create their own shape layers (special fill layers with vector masks).

Paths work best when they are used as outlines. This can make them unwieldy for recreating linework, but can also help you make very precise linework.

3\.
Every anchor point (the main thing you create with the Pen tool) can have two control handles that change how the path enters and leaves that anchor. If you merely click with the Pen tool, the anchor will be created without control handles, usually forming a corner. Dragging the Pen tool creates two control handles that are in line with each other, and makes a smooth transition from that anchor. Alt+dragging (or using the Convert Point tool) lets you break the control handles to form sharp corners. Alt+click on an anchor to remove its control handles.

Sometimes you have to zoom in to ensure you're clicking on what you want—there isn't much room for error, and it is easy to drag a segment (which will alter both control handles) when you meant to just drag one control handle.

The color and width of the path guides (which never appears on finished, exported work) can be changed in Preferences. The color of any shapes filled or stroked by paths can be changed in the Pen/Shape toolbar, the Layers panel (fill only), or by clicking the Swatch panel (PS 2020, fill only).

2\.
The Pen tool can adjust any existing anchors or control points. Get used to using the Ctrl, Alt, and Shift keys, since they change how the tool works. Without them, the Pen tool will add anchors to bare canvas or path segments, or delete an anchor and attempt to conform the remaining path segment. 

The Direct Selection tool (white triangle pointer) and Path Selection tool (black triangle pointer) also allow you to manipulate paths. The Convert Point tool can change an anchor between a bare corner (no control handles), a smooth node (linked control handles), or a sharp corner (unlinked control handles).
