The same man Swamy's boss today calls a corrupt politician. Swamy is the same man who staged the No Confidence motion against the Vajpayee government in 1999. All the crap he does today is mostly his PR team that wants to frame a narrative that Swamy is some fierce lone warrior capable of taking big people down. In reality he is just a oppurtunistic loony. He wants to harp credit for things he hasn't even done like the economic reforms and liberalisation. He is for hindutva nationalism today because the wave is towards the side of right wing populism. Tomorrow if he has a major fallout with Modi-Shah, and if the tide of this type of fake nationalism changes and people get educated, Swamy will change himself to suit the wave, that is ofc provided he stays alive till then.

samharris,fe586fo,t1_fe515ld,1578866485.0,">When discussing someone’s beliefs, perhaps we should take them at their word for what they believe and attach the ideas themselves, not the identity. So like I said, if your argument is “here’s what I think you believe and here’s why it’s wrong,” you’re at best attacking a straw man and at worst purposefully derailing discussion 

Even if the ""someone"" has based their beliefs on something that is objectively different from what they assume it is ? I think not. If talk with an atheist that says he/she believes in a god and calls themselves atheists just because its cool to identify as ? Would you still call them atheists ? So called right-libertarism is not about liberty at all. It is about tyranny. Essentially the opposite. Maybe you call it derailment, and perhaps rightly so, but I am also looking at the issue at hand here, in a world where Facebook and Disney call the shots things like stated in the OP are bound to happen. These corporations will control ""FrEe"" speech their way. And it will not be free, essentially. There will be no liberty. Perhaps I'd like to think I am discussing the core issue more than others on this thread. Corporations like Facebook(which owns Instagram) will always try to appease their partners (in this case the US government) and control ""free speech"" thereby being used as a propaganda tool for manufacturing consent.

Or perhaps if you just want to dismiss my argument because I sound too rude, you are free to do so.

Simple enough ? Maybe not. But gender and sex are different things. 

Libertarians in America are a bunch of ignorant cunts who think and market themselves as libertarians for namesake but they are just a bunch of corporatists in disguise, they basically advocate a corporatist stance, for making companies like Facebook and Disney all the more powerful. To run the country. Libertarianism as an ideology was born out of socialism, which is why it is also known as libertarian socialism in European countries, it was born out of a necessity to reduce the totalitarianism of socialism i.e. Stalinist communism. The so called libertarians in America should be called propertarians or anarcho-capitalists, cause thats the only thing they really care about. Essentially a promotion of corporate owned and caused tyranny.
In this system only people with more money and more property can live in an illusion of freedom and liberty, not everyone. Libertarianism was never about being selfish pricks.

And the point I was making was very much related to it. You see the pro-gun conservatives that voted for Trump aren't the ones who are libertarians, and you still keep on calling them so. In any other educated part of the world they would be called what they are and that is corporatists. Big corporations like Facebook do all this to support Trump and keep the US happy. Sacha Baron Cohen recently exposed them. He said they would let Nazis run their propaganda if they were paid well. This is the exact similar case. If they didn't want to, no authority could stop them from doing so. Any court in the US would've overruled it as it is against the First Amendment. Corporations do this to support and maintain warm relations with the establishment, these sanctions  cant stop them from not restricting  posts in support of Soleimani but they need favours from the establishment in this case Trump, hence they do it and give sanctions as a a reason."

Many if not most ex-virgins almost always wish they hadn't lost their virginity. So you see it is a psychological problem that is a part and parcel of being human. Many such ideas bother us, one of them is being gay, which is why many odd questions are asked like ""Is licking your toothbrush gay ?"" and etc. etc. All of this comes not with the feeling of liking to lick a toothbrush but of the fact that such a thing could relate to you being gay which may or may not be the case. This situation is similar but not the same, here the idea of being a virgin is being targeted (by you and possibly others) by associating it with your speculative worthlessness. The idea of being worthless is terrifying just by the semantics of it. No one wants to feel worthless but ironically everyone needs to find reasons to make them feel worthless. So even if you do solve your problem and lose your virginity, your brain will eventually mjster up something new to make you feel worthless. This is how humans are attracted to and encouraged to form/join cults/groups around such feelings of insecurity, this has historically since the dawn of humankind woken us up from the slumber of loneliness into groups and families which has ensured our survival."
