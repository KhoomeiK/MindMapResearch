Otoh you can also use the packs to rehydrate really dry bud (it just won't start the curing process over, your smell/taste is set). They're a much safer option than a fruit peel, as the latter can contain mold spores."

ARK,ffdbcaa,t1_ffdapo6,1579817210.0,You have a problem with gays now? Coming from how you insult people in every one of your posts you think that comment would've made you feel at home.
ARK,ffdavjs,t1_ffd9otr,1579816899.0,Lmao why do you think they'll more than double their player count after all of the bugs in Ark and now the delays? Are you really this dense???
ARK,ffdapaz,t1_ffd8ja2,1579816787.0,"The gaming field is the only one it happens in and you can make all the excuses for them that you like, but its still not acceptable. I have a degree in comp-sci I know how programming works, you can absolutely make more bugs by fixing one. However, that still doesn't change the fact that yes, when software is ordered by a company, they're expected to meet a deadline. Games are the only place where this isn't currently true, and that's because studios think it's a great idea to promise things that they have 0 control over so that they can start selling pre-orders sooner. 

But keep your head buried in the sand and going lalalala ""I'm right""."
ARK,ffd7icc,t1_ffd3n7s,1579814926.0,"Also, in any other field it is completely unprofessional to delay something like this that has already been paid for. If you pay to have your deck done in 2-4 weeks, but then it takes 8 weeks, you bet the contractor will be hearing about it. Do you think article writers get an extra 2 months past their due date? Or manufacturers? That commercial A/C you ordered and paid for, it needs to show up on time, or they better have some very clear communication as to when it'll be there.

The one big thing about any job, order, whatever, is that there needs to be clear communication or people will get upset and eventually walk away."

If not, 0 reason for you to be batting so hard for a company that literally could care less about you or your experience with them. But GL with your weird ass kissing."

And being nice tends to reach more people if you really want to help the breed."
dogs,ffcnyhw,t1_ffclv49,1579803498.0,"Is this comment really necessary 5 days later? When OP won't see it? You did read that it says more than a mile right? Sure I should've written training for a marathon, but plenty of Huskies know how to settle on less than that. A mile is an easy distance for people to gauge, and most don't even walk that much in a day.

You should try out this proverb: you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
ARK,ffckr52,t1_ffc8tfq,1579801547.0,"No Mans Lie, I love it. Heard the game is doing much better now! I just wish wildcard would get their butt in great like some of these other young studios. There's been some fantastic communication from people like the fortnite team (including the dumpster fire that's the PVE). They're actually active on Reddit, Twitter, their homepage, ect lettering players know what's up. The anthem team used to do the same until that poor game was buried after being DOA."
ARK,ffcka3v,t1_ffcg8b6,1579801258.0,Why do you insist that I don't own the game.... You really just want to be right here huh?
dogs,ffcjuh6,t1_ffchdga,1579800997.0,"I'd honestly reach out to all of them, and see how they respond. Let them know you're looking for a show prospect and a mentor, along with any dog experience you may have. Be sure to let them know that you're reaching out to other breeders as well. When you've got a good selection of breeders the best thing to do is actually meet them and their dogs and see if your personality meshes (especially if you're looking for a mentor!).

A hobby breeder generally has more time to spend answering your emails or helping you. While a bigger kennel may take some time to actually get back to you due to being on the road so much. Not every bigger kennel is like that of course, and plenty of small kennels suck at communication, just a general observation I've made over the years."
dogs,ffcj0z7,t1_ffcgbpp,1579800502.0,"Ten/prism looked to be having 3 litters a year lately (I can see 3 years with 3 litters), 2 back in '17 and back in '10 were breeding less, but definitely breeding more now. Even so, not an issue at all as they are a good show kennel.

I know a lot of herding breeders with those numbers who only show ~2 dogs at a time and rarely breed. Karagold seems to fit that. Where as what I consider a bigger show kennel has 2-4 dogs they're actively working and 3+ litters a year. I'm sure there are much smaller kennels than Kara, it's just my loose definition of a hobby kennel."
dogs,ffci4n8,t1_ffc5knm,1579799956.0,"30/20 gave Logan the worst poops until he turned two, we ended up using Purina ONE for about a year before trying the 30/20 again and everything has been peachy. Not sure if it's just young tummies that seem to have a hard time on it or what."
dogs,ffchh6w,t3_estlgm,1579799557.0,"We're finally starting our puppy search and I cannot contain myself. Nextdog won't be until next spring/fall but I've got major puppy fever. I grew up with herding breeds, and my heart dog is my terv Logan, but nextdog is going to be a Golden retriever! My finance came from labs and really needs a well trained retriever for DPT among other things (possible SD work) so it's going to be a bit of a change, but definitely a good one. Temperament is going to be everything with this pup, so if anyone knows a breeder on the west coast who has produced Golden's that do PA work send me a DM. 

I'm other news, the training facility that we've used for years shut down unexpectedly before Christmas, and I feel so lost. There's two other places within an easy drive and one of them is far to correction heavy. The other I've never used so here's to hoping things go well with our first class out there!"
dogs,ffcfvo1,t3_esv236,1579798576.0,"Gemini and Karagold would be the two that I look into first, because they seem more like a hobby kennel, and that type of person tends to work better with my personality. Magik and Tennessee have a lot of litters (4 is a ton to do every year) but they seem to have their ducks in a line and are just bigger show kennels. So what kind of relationship do you want to have with your breeder? Do you want to just take your puppy and maybe give an update every few years if you feel like it (big show kennel), or would you rather work with a hobby kennel and likely talk with, and get advice from, your breeder a few times a year?"

ARK,ffcbn8a,t1_ffcb94j,1579795952.0,"Lmao what, you really assume a ton. Sure I used the word watched, because I have not actively played the entire time it's been out. However I think [2k hours on steam](https://i.imgur.com/TlfYhWa.png) is considered having ""played"" the game. You really put the ass in assume there

Edit, have my hours"
ARK,ffcap5z,t1_ffbovgy,1579795352.0,"Weird angle? Lack of communication is the angle, or can you not read? This is the internet fam, sometimes things come across as angry because people are. I've watch ark from the beginning, hoping wildcard would develope into a good studio, they have not. Instead they continue to promise things by x date, then within 7 days or less (it's been day before sometimes) they say nope, the release is going to be a month later. That's honestly bs and they knew way before then that the game wouldnt be ready, but didn't want to say anything so that sales weren't affected. When in reality being more open with your customers leads to a better track record."
trees,ffbc6ot,t3_esnc8h,1579759277.0,Hit up r/rosin and it's sister subs. They'll be able to help you more in depth and may have guides posted.
ARK,ffbb5vl,t3_esltzy,1579758195.0,"This team is such a joke. No shit it wouldn't be released this month but could they have said anything? Honestly it probably won't be until May. Yes I said May, this is wildcard afterall, they're known for 3-6 month delays. No communication, just money grubbing! Anyone who has purchased the season pass on steam CANNOT return it if it's been in the library for more than 2 weeks, doesn't matter if it's a pre-order (wildcard had to opt for this option). Good job on being as scummy as the Apex team."

Anyone else must be called a behavioral *consultant*, and they're not nearly as qualified."
illnessfakersgonewild,ff8d690,t1_ff8bweh,1579673608.0,"I really dislike that they're using the term ""behavioral consultant"" as a way to get around the fact that none of them are board certified, but that's my gripe as a ""dog person""."
