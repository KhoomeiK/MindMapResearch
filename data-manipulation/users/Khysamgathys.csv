In the past 20 or so years however there's a revival towards a more conventional, external threat oriented military due to territorial spats with China and the loss of the assured aegis of the United States thanks to Post Cold-War politics, nationalist Filipino leadership of the 90s, and anti-American leaders such as the current Philippine administration.

The guy was a glory-hound and thought he could reenact the great Conquistador romps in the Americas in Southeast Asia only to be met with either limited success or failure every single time. He was infamously threatened by Toyotomi Hideyoshi of Japan, who demanded that Catholic missionaries should cease their ministry in Japan and for the Philippines to pay tribute to Japan instead of Spain, or else he would send a big army to destroy Spanish presence in the Philippines. This threat halted all Dasmarinas' conquistador antics in the Philippines as the Spaniards fearfully turtled up to prepare for the invasion, but Toyotomi went after Korea instead in a bizarre attempt to invade China. Funnily Toyotomi's threat led to the survival of Muslim States in Southern Philippines, whom Dasmarinas were attacking prior Toyotomi's ultimatum

Dasmarinas eventually lost his life in one of his adventures when the Chinese sailors and mercenaries of his expedition to Moluccas mutinied out of the blue and killed him in his own ship. He did leave a few lasting legacies behind such as establishing the first meaningful contact between the Philippines and Siam and founding Manila's city walls."

todayilearned,fgpvkgx,t1_fgprihy,1581012846.0,"The National Palace Museum in Taiwan derives its collection from the Forbidden City's treasures. While it is a significant trove, to say that it contains all of China's history is rather stretching it, especially owing to the size of the country and in the face of local provincial museum's collections. Not to mention how much of the stuff the Forbidden City owned dates back to a timeperiod ranging from the 700s-1900s AD. Chinese history is far older than that, and is also far more than the personal collection of its Emperors.  


Furthermore, while the Cultural Revolution was lamentable, the damage it did to heritage is rather overstated. After all, it was a rather complicated period. At the same time Mao Zedong and the Red Guard fanatics were calling for the destruction of the ""Four Olds,"" y[ou had the same freaking government conducting archaeological expeditions on Ancient & Early Imperial China,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_of_Goujian) which pretty much gave the world a previously unknown picture of what China looked like in the BCs/Early AD's. Absolutely no one before 1960s knew the physical, artefactual attributes of Chinese culture in its earlier dynasties. At the same time red guards were tearing up the Ming Emperor's tombs, [you had Zhou Enlai surrounding the Forbidden City with government troops to prevent its vandalization by said fanatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Forbidden_City#Under_the_People's_Republic_of_China). At the same time Mao exhorted the youth to destroy old ways of thinking, the government promoted Traditional Chinese Medicine to address the (self-inflicted) problem of a shortage of modern doctors. Some areas saw the destruction/vandalism of temples and sacred sites, while some areas the locals were too fucking superstitious to even dare move against it. Funnily, for a war against old culture, much of it not only survived the CR, but were discovered during the CR.  
Ultimately, the trick with understanding the CR is not so much by taking its rhetoric in face value, but by looking at what it ultimately was for: not really a war against China's old cultural heritage, but a war within the Communist party as Mao's and his faction in the CCP violently struggled to remain in power after fucking China up in the Great Leap Forward. During the CR, you're actually far more in trouble as a member of a non-Mao aligned faction of the Communist Party - or even the army (Peng Dehuai's faction at least)- than a practitioner of the traditional arts."
todayilearned,fgps5ed,t1_fgpn8i3,1581010949.0,"Its a bit more complicated than that. They were an empire, but not a colonial one. Colonial empires after all involve the creation of \*colonies:\* basically separate state entities whose sovereignity is controlled by the metropole/imperial nation who can decide what to do with the colony while limiting the colony's participation with the colonial metropole. To simplify things: Colonies aren't the same as ,say, Provinces after all, which were directly part of the Empire. There's a reason why historians of empire tend to separate the so-called ""Old Empires"" (i.e. Rome, Imperial China, the Ottomans, Habsburgs, the Early Romanovs.) from the ""New/Colonial Empires (England/Britain, Colonial France, and the other 19th Century Colonial Powers)"" Although in the historiography of Colonialism and Imperialism there are entities that straddle both categories, namely Spain and Portugal's Empires and 19th Century Russia.

Going back to China didn't have such a setup considering everyone in the realm was subject to the Emperor, as China at the time saw itself as a universalistic empire that ruled ""All Under Heaven,"" wherein the realms of the world bowed to the ""supreme virtue"" of the realm ruled by the bearer of the Mandate of Heaven (a.k.a the Emperor). As such, all that subjected groups practically had to do was just recognize the emperor as their ruler and as such, they could carry on with their way of life. Outside of certain contexts (namely the Southern Expansion) ""Sinification"" was not so much an active program in the new territories but something that gradually happened as a territory becomes part of the Empire for far too long with its people interacting with Chinesedom for centuries. Consequently this also means that all subjects are part of the realm and could therefore participate in it. To put things into perspective: an Indian nor Negro African from Britain's colonies couldn't become a prime minister in Britain (hell they couldn't even participate in the political life of their colonies), but subject Mongols/Turkics/Viets rose to very high positions in various Chinese Dynasties, especially considering the Bureaucratic Meritocracy of the Old Empire. Such was the importance of loyalty to the throne over nationality in the old Empire that a loyal ""barbarian"" was considered more Chinese than Han Chinese rebels against the throne, who were then dubbed as ""barbarians."" A good example of this was how Chinese pirates in the 16th Century were lumped off as ""Wokou"" (Japanese Pirates) by the Ming Government.

Now if you define colonialism as the establishment of settler colonies, China definitely was a ""colonial empire"" in that sense. But China's settler colonies were never separate entities as they were always directly ruled provinces as opposed to separate colonies (i.e. Britain and its American Colonies) and did not preclude the destruction of a native populace. Well, not *often* that is, there were exceptions such as the aftermath of the Dzungar War when the Manchu Qing Dynasty had enough of the threats from Dzungaria (Western Mongolia) that they exterminated the Dzungars and resettled it with Mongols/Han Chinese/Manchu settlers."

worldnews,fgldo0n,t1_fgl7znm,1580892403.0,"Actually, yes things can change without war, especially with local grievances such as these. You see, the Chinese have long mastered the art of protesting under the CCP's regime: the trick is to hit *local* authorities instead of the central government. That way, you're seen as not inciting rebellion because you're just pursuing this particular local grievance as opposed to the entire structure of the government, saving the central government a lot of face, while actually getting stuff done (and not getting arrested). As a protester you can even rely on local political rivalries to help you out by denouncing culprits, calling upon the central government to redress local wrongs, and then watch as rival officials use public anger to their advantage and winning protestors tactical victories.   


There has actually been a lot of these kinds of localized protests in China over the past three decades, which the Central Government euphemizes as ""[mass incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_incidents_in_China)."" The most famous recent example was the full-blown uprising in [Wukan Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wukan_protests) in Guangdong, when a village protested a landgrab attempt by local officials. After said officials arrested a village representative who subsequently died under police custody, Villagers responded by literally besieging local government buildings while explicitly proclaiming their loyalty to the central government and petitioning their help in the matter. Whole ordeal ended with the ouster of said corrupt local officials and villagers being able to choose their representatives."

Oh I also recommend following [Cathay Armory.](https://www.facebook.com/cathayarmory/posts/first-chinese-armor-festival-hailongtun-battlefield-2018/2172152989716074/) They're a bunch of Canadian-Chinese/Canadian Sinophiles who reconstruct Chinese armor and attend the so-called ""Armor Festivals"" in China where Chinese Historical Martial Arts, Hanfu groups, and Armor societies gather to display their work."

As to why they were like this, the decline of the Tang Dynasty is ultimately why the Song Dynasty is super-paranoid oversight of the military. You see, the Tang ran a military system that gave much leeway over their generals, chief of which was the ten Jiedushi-ruled provinces over in the Frontier.  A Jiedushi was basically a military governor, who had civil AND military power over his province (which is not the case in inner Chinese provinces), could levy his own taxes, raise his own army, and most importantly, declare war on the Emperor's behalf whenever he saw fit. The Tang believed that if frontier generals were encouraged to act on initiative instead of having to report fucking everything to central command, they could better defend the Empire and prosecute its wars far more efficiently and speedily. For a while this system worked for the Tang Dynasty, aiding in its rapid expansion across modern day Western China. However the system ultimately betrayed them when one Jiedushi- the Turkic Jiedushi An Lushan- thought he had a shot at the title of being Chinese emperor, and took the ENTIRE Western Armies with him during his now infamous rebellion, one of the worst in Chinese history.

As such, in their keenness not to repeat the mistakes of the previous dynasty, the Song Dynasty hobbled their military a lot by making it exceedingly reliant on centralized command and under a lot of civil administrative and legal oversight. The kind that can demand executions of successful generals on *mere suspicion,* as what happened to the famous Yue Fei."

Beijing Fashion Week and certain Chinese cities (often former Imperial Capitals and Cultural Tourism Hotspots) [annually does Fashion Shows with sections featuring old/traditional Chinese fashion](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1163956.shtml). This is largely due to the influence of the [Hanfu Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanfu_movement), a grassroots movement by fashion designers, historians, reenactors, hobbyists, and even Chinese nationalists which aims to study and revive traditional and period Han Chinese fashions and clothing.

Lately, China's equivalent of Historical Martial Arts societies (not to be confused with living martial arts like Wushu or Kung Fu) and the so-called [Armor societies](http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1003474/knights-in-ancient-armor-fight-to-save-chinese-culture#) (think the Hanfu movement, but on the study & reconstruction of historical armor) have joined forces with the Hanfu guys/girls and also promote their work in the same fashion shows and Hanfu Festivals."
