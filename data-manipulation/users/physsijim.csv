sanantonio,fenda3x,t3_epzndv,1579282219.0,"I think the way to solve this problem is for the Spurs to find the appropriate Hispanic NBA player.  That would be the *real* Spurs Jesus.  Side note: I worked with a guy named Jesus some years ago, and he hated that that was his name.  He said that growing up he was often asked some version of the following by his classmates: Hey Jesus, what's going to happen next?"

exchristian,fcqz4tt,t1_fcqxgcw,1577894387.0,"Since you know how things are over there, I will tell you a fun story: Some guy at church one week told me I was too fat for Jesus to take to heaven, lol.  So during the subsequent footwashing service, I decided that I would do it with this guy.  When it came time to pray for me, he prayed that I would lose weight so I could go to heaven.  I never laughed, before or since, when someone was praying for me.  As one of my co-workers said at the time, ""I didn't know that Jesus' anti-grav had a weight limit."""
