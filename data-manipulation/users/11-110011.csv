You know how to put real life into your music and that’s awesome."
AskTrumpSupporters,feldfmq,t1_felcydj,1579219575.0,"Would you agree that one of the bigger issues with it is is that they’re still receiving state funding (yours and my tax dollars) even though they get to pick and choose how long a child stays in foster care? 

I don’t agree with the sentiment whatsoever but when it’s funded by my money is when I have an issue with what they do."
AskTrumpSupporters,felcnhs,t1_felbk7k,1579219053.0,"So you’re against gays but fine with supporting a religion that has so much sexual abuse of minors in it? 

Christians are also supposed to accept everyone are they not?"
AskTrumpSupporters,felb74h,t1_fel7leo,1579218091.0,"These values typically align with Christianity, just out of curiosity, are you Christian?"
AskTrumpSupporters,fel7b5f,t1_fel4tn8,1579215605.0,"You do know they’ve gotten significantly worse under this administration, right?"
AskTrumpSupporters,fel6ulf,t1_fel5ac0,1579215320.0,"What? You really want eventually for only republicans to be able to raise children? Are you kidding me? 

“Sexual degenerates”, so you just don’t like gay people is all it is?"
AskTrumpSupporters,fekzbyt,t1_fekymzd,1579210739.0,"So do you have any statistics to back up that claim whatsoever? 

And you’re really saying that you’d rather have a child in foster care than having a loving family because they MIGHT end up having a different political opinion than you? Really?"
AskTrumpSupporters,fekvqvc,t1_fekv5e6,1579208597.0,So if they said that they’ll refuse adoption to trump supporters because it goes against their moral convictions you’d be fine with that because it’s the state’s right?
MurderedByWords,fek68e5,t1_fek4qhy,1579193466.0,Either this is a joke or you literally just proved my point
MurderedByWords,fek1e28,t1_fek166f,1579190529.0,Constitution? Oh you mean mah GUNS?
MurderedByWords,fek0mi8,t1_fek05sg,1579190060.0,"As long as people are still supporting trump they deserve the ridicule. 

Don’t get me wrong, I try to understand their views. Look at my post history, you can see in an active user in r/asktrumpsupporters and the majority of them are thick skulled and don’t care about facts. Yes not all. But a huge majority."
MurderedByWords,fejypd2,t1_fejno0a,1579188864.0,"Just remember, the constitution ONLY matters to republicans when it fits their agenda. 

Guns? Don’t even think about restricting them it’s against the constitution.

Want to criticize trump or the country? Free speech? What’s that, you can leave if you don’t like it.
