Edit: Downvote me all you want want but we all know Fishman Island was super disappointing. Villain sucked, villains crew sucked, plot was mediocre, characters were mediocre.

The only thing that made made is that he arc somewhat enjoyable was the poneglyph, Joyboy and Shirahoshi.

Seriously rhe best moment in the arc is where Luffy shows off how much better he is that Hody.

That's the reason I skip it usually. I don't need to o watch an entire arc for that. Especially when n you consider how much it was hyped up"
