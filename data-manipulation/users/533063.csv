Drugs,ffpcwzi,t3_eug88l,1580091911.0,"it’s just a waste imo unless you’re using therapeutic amounts (for you, cuz “therapeutic” means smth totally different in recreational vs psychiatric contexts.) of each to bring a desired effect. that
effect and that dosage are not rly something someone can tell you, imo you have to figure those amounts out yourself as well as thru trial and error figure out what effects you like for whatever your reasons are. If you’re looking to use substances recreationally but still somewhat responsibly that’s all i can think to tell u really

enjoy your evening"

go back but i slept for 30 hrs (thank u hydroxyzine, was dead to tbe world for a full day twas great tbf) and now i’m feeling just alright again. Sleeping for that long i feel like gave me some sort of restart tho. like i can use substances in a way that gets me thru, makes me grateful, doesn’t need to make me feel superhuman or like a legit addict, tweaking out all the time. Idk, fri night/saturday morning sure was strange. I wish u well! i’m not crazy lmao. true love to anyone reading this random comment"

My childhood cats used to do this, bubba and casper. we had other cats but they were raised together and were the ones who would use the ducts. i completely forgot about this until i saw this vid, jeez it brought me back and made me miss those cats, rip to them both. really brightened my morning to remember that about my childhood cats honestly and to see this cute vid.

MadeOfStyrofoam,fewsroq,t1_fewrr7d,1579418945.0,"wouldn’t encourage you to develop a drug addiction or alcoholism as both are quite unpleasant but id rather you at least consider any alternative to actual suicide if you genuinely don’t feel like you can get help right now or you have no confidence that “help” would actually “help” - at the same time i would urge you to challenge those beliefs. but i get that there are times you just can’t. and for me in those times i’ve just either chosen SOMETHING, or i’ve chosen nothing, if you can get what i’m saying. if you wanna talk pm me."

Cigarettes,fe6u1mt,t3_enwc5b,1578905225.0,happened to me all the time when i worked at the truck stop bc the ash tray was right on the diesel side where all the truckers were coming in and out. even tho i’m on a break i am working so i can’t say shit just smile and say “yeah i know i shouldn’t” or whatever. was annoying af cause half the time it’d be some fuckin tweaking old dude probably on a herculean amount of speed at that very moment going “yer too young/pretty/whatever to smoke!” i always just wanted to be like AY GET BACK IN UR FUCKIN TRUCK I DONT CARE. lmao but sometimes they’d keep me company during smoke breaks so it wasn’t all bad.
Drugs,fdioz5c,t3_ellgp3,1578447794.0,"dude, just go in the store and ask for a pack of whatever lol then you’ll find out. if they do id just find a place that doesn’t id there are a few in every city. when i was underage i had 2 places, one that didn’t id when a certain guy was working, and one that basically never did. Or you can just ask random people to buy cigs for you, i did that a lot while on the road, you might get rejected but a lot of people will say sure. OR, what i did most of the time, get an of-age friend to buy them by the carton for you."

UnresolvedMysteries,fc9lewv,t1_fc9l3t3,1577554419.0,"now THIS /is/ pure speculation and is just part of my thoughts on this case/issue at large, of which i have many - 1. Hannah’s attitude towards her disorder (through her own comments and through friends descriptions in the article) of being embarrassed that she went missing, obviously being so confused, getting some backlash from the public and wanting to change her name etc and 2. Hannah moving away from family to a place with lots of water access and seemingly nothing put in place to manage her condition to keep herself safe, despite knowing that she could relapse per se at any time and have no control over it. I think it is fair to assume that a big reason for the move was her being embarrassed about going missing and the public reaction to it and now all this talk of trauma and brain scans being brought up - anyone would want a fresh start. Imo it would make sense if the landscape and lack of precautions in her move was done on purpose, probably subconsciously or maybe even it was a conscious choice - she does sound like the type of person who would want to take control over her life by kind of ignoring this issue and starting over somewhere, a trait which is common for people who have suffered trauma and experience confusing effects in its wake (though also common for humans in general, we all want control! But that’s a whole other tangent.) Either way, it’s a total tragedy - she sounds awesome and like a very sweet person.
I am on a bunch of stimulants rn going through my own personal complex trauma journey so i apologize if none of this makes sense or if anything i said comes off as insensitive or offensive. got super fixated on this case now and can’t stop thinking about it and going off on more tangents."
UnresolvedMysteries,fc9l3t3,t3_egjrug,1577554278.0,"my instinctual reaction when reading into this case is that it seems she did suffer complex trauma, and the religious stuff discussed in the NY article is likely just the surface of how that upbringing affected Hannah/what kind of pain/conflict it brought her, it’s possibly the family (and even Hannah) either doesn’t want to publicly discuss or possibly isn’t even aware of if this was traumatic or if something else was going on with Hannah at any point. this case has been close to my heart since i first read about it on here a year or so ago, because dissociative fugue is something i have personal experience with, plus i am interested in psychoanalysis and Lacan, so these topics just really get me right in the breadbasket! I think the NY article did an excellent job painting a portrait of this disorder even if not much is known about Hannah’s fate, in her life and also in her understanding of her disorder - and i really respect what her mom said about wanting to keep it “mysterious.” i think the article did a really good job of pointing out some of the issues we are currently facing in understanding complex trauma, trauma in general, and dissociative disorders/symptoms. going back to what it seems many people in the comments here as well as Hannah and her family are confused about (seems like the nature of these types of phenomenon are confusing), about Hannah apparently not having any trauma in her childhood, if she was faking it all etc, i think it’s a good idea to look at the quote from the Maryland doctor - “he finds it nearly impossible to treat them in that state. He said that, in conversation, ‘there’s a quality of them running away from whatever you are trying to ask them. If you begin to hold on to them and try to get them to stay in one place, they go—they’re gone.’” I love this quote because i think it says a lot about this specific disorder and also about trauma, particularly complex trauma, in general. I’m not trying to project or say that Hannah definitely experienced trauma, but i do think that a lot of people underestimate what our minds are capable of, people are very attached and dependent on the idea of a concrete “self” and that that underestimation + dependence usually feeds into a misunderstanding of this kind of stuff (not that there is much of an “understanding” that can be reached due to the aforementioned issues in the field!). Like, we will probably never know with this specific case (even if the odds are against the likely outcome and Hannah /is/ alive somewhere), but, without delving into speculation about Hannah’s life since i just know her through reading about this case, I think it’s important to note that sometimes things can be traumatic without us even realizing it has traumatized us, a concept that gets especially tricky with complex trauma, and the field is so underdeveloped - stepping right in line with how underdeveloped society/the general population currently is with the same issues - that stuff like this is just really tough and maybe impossible to figure out. I just wish Hannah was around to possibly figure it out for herself or be able to find peace in her life without “figuring it out” and at least getting the chance to manage her condition. She was clearly a bright, inquisitive and kind person, it’s really a shame if the world has lost her."
AmItheAsshole,fbjoc9h,t3_edq6kp,1576937272.0,"this is so confusing dude. you were freaked out because a guy was getting physical with you (though you say he was oblivious to it?) in a foreign country while you’re traveling alone and your first reaction is to say you’re gay and give details on how he turns you on...? if you’re scared in a foreign country, why on earth would you think saying you’re gay would help the situation? that points to your motivation not being fear-related and yeah would just make you an asshole. Why would you not ask him to move/point out that he’s getting too close for comfort once you decide to speak to him??
edit: it wouldn’t be hilarious even if it did make an ounce of sense btw. Like if the joke here is just that it’s funny to be gay and freak people out by telling them you’re gay then yeah... you’re an asshole... duh."
