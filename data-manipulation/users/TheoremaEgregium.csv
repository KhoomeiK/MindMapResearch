You get disgusted by the insanity of TRP, how it destroys your faith in absolutely everything and how it turns people into ridiculous caricatures. Have those people never met real human beings? The folks I know have stable normal relationships, work boring 9-to-5s, and the men and women don't behave like they are different species. They are just people, not characters from YouTube drama channels.

... and then despite all you come across an experience that fits some TRP point to a tee. So maybe there's something to it after all? And you look deeper and so much fits. This explains everything. It's grim and ugly and irrefutable. And gradually the glasses you view the world through change color.

Say the ruler dies and their direct heir is still a child. Then the question is whether the strong people in the state support him/her. Those are the ruling ministers, chief nobles, often the child's mother (i.e. dowager queen). If they throw their weight behind the child they have some years where they can rule through him/her, either officially as regents or just exploiting the leadership vacuum. A convenient arrangement for someone who could not hope to ever become ruler themselves, so this happened often.

Dylan's disrespectful behaviour when he accepted the prize didn't help either.

Kazuo Ishiguro in 2017 caused a small bit of controvery too, due to him being considered not high-brow enough for some. He had even written some SciFi, which traditionally disqualifies an author from ""serious"" awards. It's called the SciFi ghetto.

In 2018 the Nobel committe was in shambles due to sexual misconduct scandals (like so many institutions these days), so they postponed that year's prize to 2019, when they gave out two. Those went to Olga Tokarczuk (well-deserved by universal agreement), and Peter Handke, who without a doubt deserved it for literary quality but is politically controversial — one might even say shunned. In fact journalists interviewing him kept pestering him about his past unwise political affiliations and he snapped or walked out a number of times. It turned into a bit of a shitshow.

AskHistory,fcn64hf,t3_ei3f2q,1577804271.0,"That's harder than you think. ""Played the way it was intended"" is the crucial phrase. You see, musical scores never describe a piece *completely*. For example go back only 200 years, to Beethoven, and there's uncertainty with a number of pieces how fast he wanted them played. The metronome had just been invented and he was an early adopter. Except in some pieces the tempi he gives are insanely, unplayably fast. Some speculate that Beethoven's metronome was broken, others think that he counted a back-and-forth swing of the pendulum as one beat instead of two — but the point is that researchers are still debating.

Each age's music had their own traditions which weren't written down in the scores but were part of the musician's education into their respective tradition. To name a modern example, a jazz standard lead sheet doesn't tell you how to play a solo. It was the same with old music. Trying to figure out today how exactly to play an improvised cadenza, how to do the basso continuo correctly, the art of ornamentation, it's a science of its own. It's called [historically informed performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_informed_performance). And there's also the question of period instruments. There used to be instruments which we don't even have any more, and those we have have changed a lot.

In short, performers and musicologists have to make informed guesses, and the farther back they go in time the more they have to guess. With Beethoven there may be uncertainty about the tempo; for Baroque music there's many questions about ornamentation and interpretation; go back to the middle ages and you have the [bare melodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neume), sometimes even without the rhythms. Go back to the ancient Greeks and it's all guesswork, although there are [some recent claims of breakthroughs](http://theconversation.com/ancient-greek-music-now-we-finally-know-what-it-sounded-like-99895)."

Then again the address of the mural is Place Bernard Cornut Gentille, and the [studio's address](http://www.a-fresco.com/contact/) on their website is different (in a different town in fact)."

Interesting story, it says the javelin stuck in the wall of a tower in the camp, and it took two days until the troops noticed it was there. Guess that's an unavoidable risk with a method like that."
