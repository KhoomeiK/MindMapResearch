webdev,ffduvhq,t1_ffaf31d,1579829509.0,LinkedIn is usually a good resource. There are recruiters specifically for tech jobs - I think TEK Systems is one of them that’s always hitting me up. Bodybuilding.com is always hiring devs. Also maybe try Micron or Clearwater. Hope that helps!
webdev,ffac85g,t1_ffa125i,1579732114.0,You are so welcome! I'm glad you found it helpful. Best of luck to you!!

Since you have the UI/UX interests, have you been exploring jobs in that field? They are an excellent way to learn about working with devs and seeing how their jobs work, so you can see if that is what you want to do. Production designers (less creative, more dictated layout) seem to always be needed. 

It does seem like everyone is learning to code, so the pool is pretty diluted. But, if you can show that you stand out in other ways - design experience, or 'hey look at this thing I build in my free time"" - then that gives you the hook you need. 

Keep on keepin on!"
webdev,ff9gmju,t1_ff8fos6,1579712592.0,"I'm so glad to help. Thanks for your appreciation. 

My initial thought is that you might want to consider looking for positions that may not be dev jobs, but related tangentially. Meaning, look at companies where you want to work and see if there are jobs that you can do, that may not pay as much, but would get you in the door. Continue working on dev projects in your spare time. I started out in part-time tech support while going to school, and then went to full time at the same company while I taught myself HTML and CSS. From there they moved me to being a web designer and developer. Stayed there for 9 years and really got my skillset honed in. 

Like I said to OP, drive and ambition will get you places a hell of a lot faster than the bullet points on your resume (not that they don't matter, but ya know). And always be learning and demonstrating what you've learned. Let people know about it. Throw your projects on your LinkedIn profile and make sure they show up in your feed.

I've lived in Boise for 19 years and it has seen a lot of growth, despite the recessions. But it has been steady and stable growth. 

Keep at it and try not to get too bogged down with the time it takes to get there. :)"

webdev,ff8a3n0,t3_es5lbi,1579670542.0,"I haven't read any of the other comments, but here goes. I live in Boise, and the market here for devs is fan-fucking-tastic. ***Even for devs with little to no experience*****.** My company just hired an ex-insurance agent who went to a coding school (in his 30's) and has zero experience in the field. There is a market for you - it does exist.

**Do not give up.** 

You may just have to look outside of where you live. The Bay Area is too diluted and the options are so plentiful that companies can be REALLY selective. I worked for a startup in Palo Alto, and traveled there occasionally, so I do know a bit about Silicon Valley. My advice would be this: if you aren't tied to anyone/anything there, consider relocating. There are plenty of companies that will pay for you to relocate. The cost of living is so much lower in places like Boise (which, much like Hansel, is so hot right now). And yes, the pay is lower, but it's much better relative to the cost of living. **Your net income is so much better, and I think quality of life is better here too.**

Also, the fact that you have experience with design is a great advantage. I also do, and it comes in handy all the time. The ability to converse intelligently with people in other departments (UX/UI, designers) is paramount and will help you and your team work more efficiently. Continue highlighting that as a skillset.

The fact that you're an active Github-er is awesome. The job is just a technicality. Employers see your drive and ambition, which in all honesty, is missing in so many devs that I have worked with that it is appalling. Keep it up. Strive for achieving your goal, and YOU WILL. 

I am a (female) front end developer, who began as a designer and is self-taught the entire way through HTML, CSS, JS... and today I work at a company making a solid salary building React apps. It can be a tough grind, but hold on to the people you meet along the way. I have been shocked at how knowing one person can propel me through my career in all sorts of different ways. I'm not saying you have to network, cuz I don't. I just don't like it. But if it's your jam, DO IT. Otherwise, just keep your eyes peeled for a person here or there that may know someone who knows someone, ya know?

I've been doing this for nearly 20 years (not a boomer tho), and I've learned that one thing *never* changes: there are always opportunities for someone with drive and ambition. Always. You got this. 

Also want to say thank you for your post. Thanks for reaching out before you got into a place too dark. I think you'll be amazed at the amount of support there is out there; all you have to do is ask for it.

Keep us posted! I need to know how your amazing story unfolds..."

Pardon me, but FUCK the guy who did that to you. Men will never know what it feels like to be violated in that way, so they have no idea how harmful their actions are. You should feel so proud and empowered that you've taken back your life. And like others said, don't hide those scars. They're a part of you and how you became the person you are now.
