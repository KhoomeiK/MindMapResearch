Having said that, the thing that seems to keep me humble in any area of my life is contact with hard no subjective truths about myself.  Like measure the traits you think you have and realize just how often you don't have them.  Do something competitive as a sport (or count reps or distance or something), and see just how short of your own idea of yourself you actually are.  It's hard to maintain the image of yourself as an athlete when you gas out on the basketball court.  It's hard to continue to front as a reader when you count all the books you read last year and it was two.  And so on.  Failure comes only from doing things it's possible to fail at, and change only comes from butting up against that failure.  If TLP narcissism is ""protection against change,"" then it would naturally also avoid direct contact with objective reality.  Objective reality destroys carefully built illusions about you and the universe."

Imagine a street fight between two guys.  One guy is a brawler, he will grab anything handy to use as a weapon, he'll coordinate with his buddies, he'll use the environment.

The republicans have completely dominated politics and government because no matter what happens, they understand the game.  Winning elections is the only thing that counts, and as such they have done everything they can to ensure victory.  They're basically cheating, but they know there's no referee to penalize them for that, and they're getting touchdown after touchdown.  They basically control the judicial branch, meaning quite literally that anything outside of their agenda is going to get slapped down hard.  They control the states in much of the country and thus can pretty much keep likely democratic voters from voting or hide their votes in a majority republican district.  And because they control the courts, it's legal.  They did that by understanding the truth of the game -- there's no ref, and only the final score matters.  And they did that by training everyone in their tribe that voting for a democrat for *any* reason, or not voting for *any* reason is giving their enemies the victory.  

The democrats **still** don't seem to get that.  They're still assuming that a giant sky-ref will see them being honest, decent, and having the ""right"" answer and somehow reward them with the ability to do all the things we want to.  They'll morally judge their side and not vote for the democrat because he's not perfect on politics.  Or he said something stupid, or whatever.  They don't want to Gerrymander or coordinate the message because it's not the ""right"" way to play the game.  And then lose again, and again and again because they're playing by the gentlesirs rules of honor and decency and being nice and they're losing.

Go ahead and play that way.  Once we lose Ginsberg, unless there's a democrat majority in power, you can pretty much call the game because the entire democratic agenda will be declared unconstitutional.  And there won't be a thing you can do about it."

The West is much more individual and independent than most other places on Earth thus leading to the idea of individual rights and wants and so on.  Because Christians and Jews have a very text-oriented religion (meaning that the texts of the Bible are the central source of the beliefs) this makes individual investigation of religious dogma part of the religion in ways that wouldn't happen in other religions.  This Fosters the push for literacy, the decline of traditional authorities, and an environment conducive to inquiries into every subject available.

If you move the whole family so Johnny can train figure skating, he not only has the pressure of being good because he's getting all of this expensive training, but because his skill is the cause of the whole family uprooting and moving to the training areas.  He can't quit, obviously, because it's his destiny or they wouldn't have done it.  He has to win or the move is for nothing.  Oh, and training is all day, everyday.

Someone chosen by Sortition has a lot less experience in politics, and thus would be more beholden to outside experts than a professional politician would.  Last week, you were a programmer, this week you're a politician deciding whether to agree to a treaty with a country you know little about and can't find on a map without google.  The experts (lobby, basically, because they know that's where the power is) will tell you whatever you need to hear without fear that you'd know enough to call them out.  And the same would be true of practically every single Issue.  You don't know enough to make the decision yourself, so you have to go straight to the lobby for pre written laws that serve those guys because you can't figure it out on your own.

I see far too many kids go just to go.  They might *maybe* have an idea of what they want to do, but not much more than that.  It's like they decided to major in the thing they liked best in high school or something their family or friends are into.  They don't look into the jobs, the competition for that job, the pay, or the expected work hours, travel none of that.  Then they pick the school not on any rational basis, but on things like the activities, the stone buildings, the sports, or the town.  They aren't looking at the quality of the program, the internships, the costs, the professors, or the recruitment from that program.  This is pants on head stupid, and any parent who would be okay with this sort of approach to career planning is neglecting their kid in my view.

Ideally, you'd treat college like any other investment.  What you want is the best deal you can get.  You want to know what jobs are available and the skills you need to master to get there.  You want to get the good internships and go to the school with the best program.  You want to make sure that your future salary will allow you to pay for your education.

slatestarcodex,feohnb0,t3_epsti9,1579300335.0,"My best guesses here.

First, politics has become a philosophy of life for the people who get into it.  As in a lifestyle.  This really makes ending a beef in any way other than capitulation impossible.  If the path to utopia requires low taxes, anything else is bad.  You can't negotiate on dogma, nor can you compromise on axioms.  You can't negotiate on wokeness either.  It's weird, because there are actually ""conversion"" stories.  I used to be Liberal but then something happened.  I used to be conservative but something happened.  

Second, the amount of power people have over politics is really small right now.  The best single predictor of what specific policies will be put in place is the position of the wealthy.  So it's really a low stakes game.  You don't have to worry much about being *right*, because the chances that you will be permitted to have a voice in these issues is pretty low.  And when there's no need for people to come together to solve problems there's again less need to come together on issues.  

Third, Americans are a lot less connected to other people and a lot more stress.  So I think some of this might be the result of political arguments being a safe place to let out frustrations in places where you're unlikely to get much real life blowback.  You can't yell at your jerk of a boss, you can't yell at your wife or your kids or your neighbors.  But you can yell at those damn (liberals/conservatives), you can cheer on your own side.

The game works like this:

Everyone in the game has some amount of social capital to spend. You can win more by doing things that project either power or competence.  You lose it by looking weak or incompetent.  

But nobody can see anything other than the face up cards on the table (the publicly known facts) their own cards (the things they know) and the social capital on the table (both their stacks and the other side's stack).  

So the real game is to get them to run out of chips.  If you can get them to double or triple down on something with low odds and they loose, they quickly run so low on chips that allow them to be taken seriously or to put forward an agenda.  They've blown through almost all of the chips, but I think it's because he's goading them into it.

Our poor family cannot afford good food, must scrape to afford medical treatment, and dies younger and after worse illnesses.  If you're rich, type 2 diabetes is a pretty easy to manage thing, because you can afford the treatments and the more expensive food.  You can actively manage your symptoms and afford all the blood tests.  Chances are that you caught it early too.  If you're unable to do that, a chronic disease like this will require more hospital stays probably amputations, loss of the ability to work, etc.  and you're dying younger and after bleeding off a significant portion of your wealth to deal with the disease.  So you can essentially discount any income earned after that sort of disease hits as most of it will go to the health care industry.

If 25% of all Americans have something, then you're either going to somehow fangle getting through the work week with 25% of the people in various ways begging off some task or taking a MH day or two.  This has the potential to become quite chaotic, and as the cases become ever more mild and the requests become both more frequent and more burdensome, eventuality patience will run out.  You can't run a successful accounting firm when 25% of your staff is too anxious or depressed to negotiate the stresses of tax season (which going by /r/accounting is pretty stressful even for the healthy) so then what?  Eventually you have to crack down on those things.  Who gets hurt by the crackdown?  People with actual serious issues that were helped at first by the accommodations.  They need that shit, and they're less able to advocate for themselves than their healthier peers.  

The other thing that happens is that access to services gets clogged up.  There are only so many psychologists and psychiatrists in a city, and each one can only take so many patients in a day.  Which means that once the slots are full, someone getting an appointment has to wait a while or go to a hospital.  Crisis lines are choked with callers as well.  That means that by the time someone with severe mental illness tries to get help, you're talking weeks or months of waiting.

Second, I think there are times when the label itself ends up making things worse.  It takes a minor issue and turns it into a disorder and it blows it up in people's mind.  You're *depressed* and you can't do anything about it, and it's semi permanent so you're going to feel this way for years.  

Third, psychology itself doesn't really do statistical norms for most disorders which makes it very difficult to know the difference between a normal person with a very minor symptom (say losing keys once a month) and an Illness.

The problem isn't occasionally drinking.

My TLDR of sensing is ""applied system thinking"" in other words ""how does this thing work in the real world.""  The intuitive way of thinking tends to go in the opposite direction, from the real world to the abstract systems behind the system.  It's ""systems thinking"" or ""meta-analysis"".  Thinking about which classification system applies to a situation is intuitive, and inventing one certainly is.  Applying one isn't.  And most of the stuff you do in personality psychology on the layman level is applied theory."
mbti,fdzp1n8,t1_fdyktm2,1578792647.0,"I don't agree actually.  Catagories are an intrinsically sensor thing.  Any sort of classification system is.  What it (and all forms of classification are at base) is a form of pattern matching.  Thinking vs. Feeling is based on observations about what a person prefers to spend time doing and how they decide what to do.  That's not abstract because it's based on already existing definitions and patterns.  You don't need to be intuitive to say ""X person is highly motivated by thinking,"" any more than you'd need to be intuitive to recognize the difference between a spider and an insect.  You're applying the given definition in either case.  Does this meet the criteria I've been given?  In fact, I would personally suspect that the people who are good at typing and explaining the definitions of the cognitive functions are more likely to be Sensors (probably introverted sensors) than intuitives.  

Now if we were talking about inventing a new system of classification you might have a strong case.  If there's one thing I would use to define N types it would be ""meta"" style thinking.  So discussion about how to best make a decision, how to approach a problem, high level cause and effects, this things tend to be things that intuitives eat up.  Sensors tend to be much more interested in the application of theory, the specific solutions to the specific problems we're dealing with.

But another thing that's not often brought up is just how disconnected we are from each other.  Starting from very young, we spend a lot of our time separated from our own family.  If you're a typical working family, you're working 60 hours a week, and then driving maybe an hour each way.  So you might leave home at 7 and not return until 7pm.  And the kids during that time are in daycares or schools (but I repeat myself/s). You don't have much time left over for spending quality time with family and friends.  If you're in bed by 10, you're only able to spend a few hours a day with your actual family.  And given chores and homework, a lot of that is work time.  

Which makes me suspect that a lot of this might be down to just not having time with other people you care about.  And if this has been for your life, you probably didn't form secure attachments with your parents (maternity leave is pretty short), and you were basically institutionalized as you were one of at least ten kids in the daycare or one of twenty kids in your class at school.  Add to this the things that you'd learn from your parents but not from the institution.  How to properly process your emotions, how to connect to other people, how to figure out what makes you happy.  Without knowing those things and being able to form a stable deep connection with other people, stressors become much bigger than they would be otherwise.

This puts a damper on growth because there's a lot of physical barriers keeping a hate group small.  You have to live within a drive able radius of the meeting (you thus cannot be a member of the Midwest KKK and live in Australia), you have to feel either strongly enough or safe enough to be seen in such a meeting (because you're probably going to be identified eventually).  It dampens radicalism because of the danger of identification, and because new members will leave and never come back if they think the group is a bunch of radical crazy people.  It also dampens the controls that a group can have on your mental life.  On the Internet, you can reradicalize yourself hourly if you want to.  There's always a fresh new outrage, more memes, more stuff about how your ethnicity is better and how you're being held back by the grand conspiracy.  In the pre internet period, you might have had a tiny newsletter printed out at kinkos once a week.  It's a lot harder to get your rage on if you have a week to cool down in the meantime.  The physicality of the group was an accidental prevention measure for radicalization.  The thing the Internet changed has nothing to do with the group, it's just removing the natural barriers that prevent it from growing to fast or strong.

It's the same thing the Internet did for shopping, in a sense.  In 1989, if you wanted something, you had to plan a trip to the store, go find that item, stand in line to pay for it, and drive home.

They're busy with kids, jobs, chores, and so on.  Asking them to spend their scant free time reading long form articles or books or listening to hour long podcasts is a big ask.  Second, most people aren't educated enough to really follow a long argument.  The average person reads on a sixth grade level, and among those who read actual books, the most common genre is Young Adult Fiction.  Stuff written for kids.  People who read Harry Potter aren't going to read Kant or policy papers.

While it's good that liberals have thought out their positions, they really need to learn that the average American is not a urban professional with a master's degree, but someone with a community college AA degree working in either low level offices, sales, or blue collar jobs.  Communication requires that you talk to the audience instead of at them.  If they can't follow your ideas, they can't support them."
bestof,fdjrvfi,t1_fdhsp6s,1578485199.0,I find it kinda fun no matter what the politics are.  Most people don't actually know how anything around them actually works.  Get them in a position where they can't use a conventional argument and they'll be completely dumbfounded and unable to follow your thinking.  People who argue about the economy or the environment have very little idea about how these things work and often don't know basic terms like GDP or GNP.

goodlongposts,fdf1j97,t1_fdewgmw,1578351201.0,"You've never worked in a field, you generally only have a very vague idea of how it really works.  Sure you can read about it, but it's abstract.  I can read about the life of actors and directors all day long, but that's not the same thing as having the actual experience of making a movie.  So when I read about a criticism about things going on in movie sets I have very little personal experience upon which to draw when deciding whether the claims are actually true.  

And if the last business job you personally worked were the standard kinds of high school and college kid jobs, then you really have no personal understanding of how decisions are made on a day to day basis in an actual business.  You never had to look at an income statement and figure out how to trim expenses to keep the lights on.  As such when businesses are accused of doing bad things, you don't really have any way to think about why they're doing that."
TheMotte,fden6tr,t1_fd9xehi,1578342556.0,"I think that's a big part of the appeal to me.  Animation is probably the best form of filmmaking because you can literally do anything you want for any reason you want to.  There are no limits you can suddenly have your hero appear to be a baby (either because the situation makes him feel like one or because something he does is childish) which would be very hard to pull off often in regular tv shows.  You can exaggerate things to enhance a feeling, you can do dreams and fantasies-- and it doesn't cost more than making the normal show.

Unfortunately, most western tv producers see animation as either kid stuff or comedy.  They just don't really make a show for adults that's animated, and most adults would never watch such a thing because it's culturally seen as a kiddie medium."

>I mean sure except not really. The humanities may have faltered financially before, but it has never faltered *culturally* like it currently has. Everoyne regarding English degrees as a dumb waste of time is more dangerous than 1,000 university bankruptcies, because it destroys the only reason aristocratic fancy pants have to send their children off. If getting a humanities degree marks one as a 'sucker', then the humanities' reputation - all it has left - is gone and may never come back.

Well, for one thing, they don't really do what could be called research.  It's completely unempirical bull written by people who generally don't understand why they're even doing peer review.  It's basically masterbation in journal form, nothing is rejected or refuted, we aren't learning anything except how to reinterpret a text.  Second, the actual texts themselves are much more available than they would have been when we turned them into humanities subjects.  If I want to study humanities, I can do so easily by buying those books from Amazon and reading them myself.  I might even buy a pipe.  Third, the absurdity of paying a house payment to study something you can easily do for the cost of books and doesn't teach you anything true or useful is pretty obvious at this point."

Anticonsumption,fdb91es,t1_fd93hrq,1578255063.0,"It's not just about you, and the ad itself isn't just about selling you that product on that day.  It's a lot more about controlling the culture, about making Coke or Budweiser the drink associated with certain activities or events.  Taking the Coke polar bear ads as an example of this.  The entire culture sees these ads and because they're seasonal, it becomes part of the cultural background of Christmas, right alongside other Christmas icons like elves, snowmen, reindeer, and Santa.  Because of this association, people are likely to look for Coke at holiday celebrations, or to serve it at their own.  Thus it might replace older, more traditional drinks like egg nog or cranberry juice cocktails or whatever else.  The same has long since happened with sports and beer.  Everyone has been cultured for nearly a century to drink beer while watching sports.  Beers have sponsored sports since pro sports have existed, they're served in the stadiums, they're putting team logos on the cans.  All of this has created a social expectation -- when you watch sports, you should drink beer.  And almost every tailgate party, home sports watch party, etcetera will absolutely have beer and people think it's weird when it doesn't.  The same happens in the stands, it expected that must adults watching the game in the stands will buy a beer.  That wasn't an accident, it was advertising."
Meditation,fd5sc10,t3_ek1qmc,1578180942.0,"Think about why.  I don't think it's evil so much as ignorance and inertia.  Most people don't pay attention because they're too busy trying to survive themselves.  At least in the USA.  The average person is working more than 40 hours a week, and if you add in a family, they have very little time that isn't being taken up by either their jobs or their family or chores.  Studying world news takes time and energy that not everyone has available.  And given the unresponsive nature of at least the American government, most people have very little power outside of very local issues.  Australia is very much an international issue, one that I as an American can do almost nothing about."

Learning a language likewise is simply too broad and too deep to try to cover in a webpage.

The advice is good, and should really only be surprising to someone with negligent parents and no other positive role models, or perhaps people who have depression and thus ignore that advice until they here it later from another source.  

Where this breaks down is that he's absolutely exploiting this audience of vulnerable people.  He's using them to forward a political agenda and sell lecture tickets and books.  And he does very little to discourage toxic behavior in the spaces devoted to his ideas.  His Facebook groups are full of Nazis that he hasn't said anything against.  He's been pictured with people holding the Kekistani flag or wearing shirts that have nationalist slogans.  He's never said anything against his own cult of personality.  I don't think he does so because he's a nationalist, I think he does so because he's popular among nationalists and doesn't want to lose his fan base."

He couldn't even slow down when alt right people did actually kill people and yell about his channel (and if it happened to someone with a conscience, not only would they have slowed down on the things attractive to the right, they would have deleted the account!) he isn't really against Nazis, he's against the idea of him hanging around Nazis getting him in trouble.

I know people with serious attention problems and it's not ""LOL I just lost my keys again, and I'm not on the deans list,"" it's losing a job because you don't finish projects or get eviction notices because you forgot to pay the rent.

Yeah, I like to make decisions logically, I like to explore ideas, and I worry.  Who could reach the age of adulthood and not be aware of such basic things?

That's the thing with college.  Unless you can thread all of those needles and do so well, you're probably not going to beat the student loan payments to break even.  Everyone says it pays off.  But if you're putting all those extra earnings into paying for the loans, you're not ahead here.  You might even end up behind if you factor in the years spent not working and the interest that the money you paid to the school would have earned (the market over the last 8 years has been around 8%, and if you invested the money used to pay off the loans, you're talking substantial money). 

Yes, if you go and get a great 6 figure job right out of school you probably made a good decision.  If you end up with less, you might be better off learning a trade.  College really only works for those who are smart enough, or connected enough to make it pay for them.  If you're below average, you're probably better off doing something else because you won't have the grades or internships to stand out against the top 10% students."
