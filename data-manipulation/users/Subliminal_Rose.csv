Not sure what exactly the mirror is but I’d assume it’s tech developed by the previous inhabitants of the land or the master itself to control the powers of the tricos. 

As for the armored Trico, she is also a different color than Trico, so perhaps the wings are a gender difference? Not sure. It’s imposible to know without asking Ueda."

There are no romantic relationships among the ones chosen, because the majority of them had significant others before the ceremony."
