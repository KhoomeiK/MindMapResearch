helpme,fcwwo04,t3_ejarwh,1578040789.0,"I’m not a psychiatrist and I can’t officially diagnose you

But to me it sounds like disassociation, it’s common. Don’t worry you haven’t gone crazy,  almost everyone experiences something like this in their life. 

It’s usually caused by something traumatic or it can be caused by something in your life that’s making you unhappy. 

What I would suggest is getting help to maybe find the source of this problem. 

Good luck!"
