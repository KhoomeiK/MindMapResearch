WritingPrompts,ffg221k,t3_etbujn,1579896769.0,"We were standing just outside of the drunk tank, most of us with pounding headaches and the bitter taste of bile in our mouths.

""Where y'all  frum?"" The sheriff's drawling accent was nothing like the way they talk back home, and took me a moment to understand what he was saying, and took me a couple moments longer than the rest of my friends.

""Upper Ibacaster, sir."" I replied, to a bunch of confused faces, ""It's like you all haven't heard of it."" Concern struck me when the color drained from the man's face, he made a cross on his chest, and made a silent prayer up to God. 

Next thing I know I am being ushered through the door into a small room, dimly lit with only two chairs and a small table. ""Excuse me! Am I being arrested?!"" I demanded. 

""No. You are fine, but we need to talk."" The sheriff's voice was completely different from before, accent all gone. I watch as he looks up to the small camera in the corner, taking the bright pink bubblegum he was chewing and reaching up to cover the lens and, presumably, the microphone. 

A sense of dread crept over me, but I was always taught to listen people out, so I sat down in one of the chairs.

The sheriff takes a deep breath, then begins, rather loudly ""Upper Ibacaster is not a place.""

I spluttered, standing again. But his hand was on my shoulder and pushing me back into it, now whispering. ""Officially. Officially Ibacaster is not a place and never has been."" This piqued my interest, and I sat again. ""But unofficially,"" he said, ""Unofficially I am also from Ibacaster, and what I'm telling you will save you from trekking the same path I sunk my first decade on in this town, in this nation.""

I nodded slowly, and he continued. ""What was the most striking thing you saw here when you arrived?""

""The people in white?"" He nodded.

""That's good. They haven't noticed you yet.""

""Who? What do you mean? Why does Ibacaster not exist?""

""Twenty-three years ago, the government was forcefully taken over in a military coup. The new government asked all the cities around the country to pay fealty to them, to show loyalty. The first town to deny them was razed to the ground. Still, several more denied and they were destroyed, too, Ibacaster was one of them.""

""But Ibacaster isn't destroyed!""

""Yes, I was getting to that. I assume Doctor Ness is still living there?""

""The doctor? Yeah, what about that old coot?""

""He saved the town, and made sure the new government never saw that it wasn't destroyed. The man's a bloody genius, you should show some respect.""

AskReddit,fdo8pip,t1_fdn6qor,1578600824.0,"I never actively unsubscribed to him, but I know where my turning point was.

It was the charity livestream that one of the goals was he was giving out a burner phone app number to talk to fans. We tanked the little app immediately. He tried discord, but it ended up being a bunch of screeching fans in the voice chat. Thankfully I didn't hear the worst of it, but everyone said it was bad. Anyway, he settled on using google hangouts. I didn't know how to use it, so I was disappointed, but that wasn't the problem.

He decided he was going to do a bonercast bit, and the first girl(s?) that called weren't playing along and asked for a shoutout. Which, yeah, not part of the improv, but instead of giving them a second chance, he just..

Hung up.

The others who were doing the stream with him (I forget who) honestly looked surprised that Mark did that. The next person who was called up was told beforehand to play along and I remember Mark saying that if they didn't abide by the bonercast bit, he would hang up, and one of the others was like ""and that's not a joke!""

Something about that just.. Broke me? Broke my perception of him?

All of his videos that I saw after that felt, impersonal and cold. I thought it was maybe just me, but then I watched his West of Loathing series again, and that spark was there again! It was funny, it made me happy.

But then I realized it wasn't just me.

TL;DR: Markiplier did something on a charity livestream that I felt was dickish, and his following videos made me feel disconnected, but an old series didn't, so something changed."
outside,fdnzpfi,t3_ejii5r,1578596129.0,"I'm assuming you are referring to the ""World War"" event, as normal ""war"" events occur often enough.

I heard that it would be completely different to the previous two, as the item ""Nuclear weapon"" was added to the American server at the tail end of the second world war event, and was able to convince the Japanese server to surrender after using it only twice. But now, lots of servers around r/outside have them. They also add a debuff to the area they effect for a long time."
outside,fdnyegr,t3_em6g5z,1578595372.0,"The most obvious answer is unregulated player killing. That being said, during the ""war"" events, killing players from other servers that also engage in the events doesn't require bans unless they are killed using some of the banned moves, like the item ""mustard gas.""

That and the looting of other player's items without their permission generally bans you from certain quests.

Other than that, each server has their own sets of rules that may or may not ban you from certain quests or sidequests."

I was in like, kindergarten or 1st grade. (These are the first two years of required ""schooling"" for people outside the US, kindergarten is more learning to interact with others, learning how to read, learning how to spend time in school).

Anyway, we were in lunch. I had nachos and cheese. The cheese was the plastic nacho cheese.

I placed a chip in the ""cheese"" and I thought it looked like a boat, so I said ""My nacho looks like a ship!""

The children around me immediately went ""oooooOOOO! THETRIANGLELIES said the S-word!""

At this point, I didn't know what curse words were, but I knew that whatever they THOUGHT I said was bad.

So I quickly said ""No, no! I said SHIP! SHIP!""

Then a yardduty came over because of the commotion, and some more stuff happened, I tried to explain to her, but I ended up getting a call home- horrible punishment for a 6-7 year old.

But when I got home, my parents were really understanding, and told me I wasn't in trouble with them. They also told me of the word shit.

And that was the story of how I learned my first curse word! <3"
