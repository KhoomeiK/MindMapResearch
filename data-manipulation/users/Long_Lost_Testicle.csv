I still want it to be at the refs discretion though.  

Grab the cage to stop a takedown?  Deduct points or start them on the ground.  

Eye pokes?  Switch to Pride style gloves and then reevaluate the frequency and severity of the problem.

If someone fingers get hooked in their opponents shorts, but it's inconsequential, that's not a good reason to drastically tilt the fight one way by deducting points. Taking points isn't a deterrent here, because it's not happening on purpose.  

Ultimately, I want to see who the most skilled fighter is, and I want minimal ref involvement.  We've seen what happens when a Mazagatti is in the cage and how he personally changed fight outcomes.

Sure, but that's another topic. You're talking about dieing easily (and a lot about ibex), and I'm talking about traits of apex predators, specifically in the context of 1on1 combat.  It's super cool that we use our giant brains to build tools that can cancel out disadvantages in size, fangs, claws, strength, etc.  It's super cool, because without tools like pointy sticks and teamwork, we lose 99/100 of 1on1 fights with apex predators AND a surprising number of non-predators.
