There's a reason why this area has high insurance and it's because these 'car enthusiasts' are treating them like a race track. 

I put car enthusiasts in quotes because I don't believe these drivers are car enthusiasts. Track time is not that expensive. If you can afford whatever sports car you're ripping around the neighborhood, you can absolutely afford any open lap days at the track."

AskReddit,fd385r1,t3_ejubhh,1578155683.0,"Uhh not as big of a change from me..I went from a smaller city in Ontario to Toronto Ontario. 

Thought the grass was greener with bigger opportunities in Toronto. The grass is most definitely NOT greener. The people are not as friendly, its a pain in the ass getting anywhere unless you're willing to take the TTC, but I hate the TTC. Everything, I mean everything, is expensive. Most of the things aside from touristy stuff seem to revolve around food, which doesn't quite resonate with me because of the hassle to get to the restaurant, then buying a $15 dish I could probably make at home for $5.

I've only been in Toronto for 8 months and I'm tired of it already. And what the fuck is up with the smell of the city?

 I've always known a joke to be, the best way to see Toronto is through a rear view mirror. 

I'm probably gonna get a lot of downvotes from Toronto residents but I dunno guys, it's just not for me."
