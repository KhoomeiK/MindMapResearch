She showed up over a year later with black electrical tape around her neck and her beautiful plush fur totally matted and the pads of her feet cut and sliced. She never left our backyard again. She was probably the most gentle cat I have ever had. She had silent meows,accept for the night she came home . It was the loudest,  most pitiful sound I have ever heard a cat make. We didn't recognize her at first!!"

Another friend came up, she had her dog on a leash.  I had been absently petting my cat as he walked around. When my friends dog came up I petted it also.  All of a sudden,  I  felt this wet, warm feeling on my back. I jumped up, turned around and there he was. I think I scared one of his lives out of his allotted 9 when I yelled at him. We and he were around other animals all the time. So,  I'm not sure what set him off.  Only animal that has ever done that to me."

Doesn't matter what size, they will try to squeeze into it. LOL  I have dangle toys on the end of plastic sticks (safer for your hands) when they get really excited. I had a cat named Merlin, who would also play fetch. Not a trick most cats can do. I have had hundreds of cats over the years, and each one is as different as each one of us.  They have different likes and dislikes. But, I have loved and been loved by each one. All of our kitties were rescued. Have great fun with Cole, she and you are both lucky to have each other."

I too worried about the less aggressive babies during play time. I didn't have a laser, but I would use multiple toys.  The dominant one would play with the feather and I would play mouse or just slowly pull a string along the ground. If the dominant kitten attacked the string, I would just switch. The dominant ones always turn out to be great hunters. Out in the country they brought me all sorts of critters.  LOL"
NoStupidQuestions,fdkdxxo,t3_eiofld,1578501828.0,"My Mom adopted a stray, the Vet said was half German Shepherd and half Coyote. We had a litter of kittens at the playful hide and seek stage.
I always tried to put our kittens in the garage for safety if we were not home. I always took my Mom to church. One day she was running late. I had all but 2 of the kittens in the garage and she refused to let me look anymore for them. When I came back I still couldn't find them Later that evening the little black one Gnat, showed up in a pitiful state,  she had been mauled. She died in my arms a few hours later. I never did find my little striped Prince. I suspect the adopted dog killed them She had been living rough for months out in the country where we lived.  She would eat anything. She ate any bug, worm anything that resembled food when she first came to us. So, she was my primary subject for doing the deed.
Later, she got along with the cats very well.
I think she may have been trying to play with them.  She was only a pup herself."
