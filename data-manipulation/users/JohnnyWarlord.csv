If we stopped breeding sheep for wool, there would be less and less sheep alive for the specific purpose of using them. You (naively) act like the sheep are just naturally being born and not specifically bred for a purpose. And yes. I understand there are animals that suffer far more than sheep that are sheared for wool, but whataboutism doesnt mean the problem doesnt exist."
facepalm,fgtyx55,t1_fgtxm8p,1581111205.0,Honestly im not going to act like i know what the exact solution is. What we are doing now is wrong though and its a human made problem so i think we should do whatever to fix it and the only way i see is “neutering out of existence”. Even if it sounds bad it might be whats right.
facepalm,fgtqbw2,t1_fgtpd4e,1581108012.0,"Sorry for being aggro, just tired of that argument coming up. Theres a definite line between using animals solely for entertainment and using them for production of goods. I definitely have less of an issue with pets, but still feel morally conflicted. I have cats and i love them and take care of them well but im not sure theyre as happy as they would be if they could live in nature. I wasnt vegan when i got my cats but im not sure if i would buy another pet in the future."
facepalm,fgtkdz6,t1_fgtk0wt,1581105682.0,I. NEVER. SAID. EUTHANIZE. Jesus. Its like someone saying we should free the slaves and everyones just like why do you want to murder all the slaves. Yes i think we shouldnt breed pugs to the point they have been. I dont see how theres any argument against that.
facepalm,fgtgjs7,t1_fgtfvch,1581104132.0,How is it ever too late? Are you really saying we cant stop breeding sheep for wool? Im not saying we start breeding them without wool. Just stop breeding them for it.
facepalm,fgtfven,t1_fgtdxf6,1581103969.0,"Is it morally okay to breed an animal in a way where it literally grows too much wool to live without human intervention. Its like the “cows need to be milked so its okay to milk them” when the only reason they “need” the intervention is because we cause the problem. 

And yes. A slave. Whether it lives in a pasture, whether it gets healthcare, whether it gets constant food thats what it is."
facepalm,fgtcefo,t1_fgt7ym6,1581102578.0,The point is stop breeding them purely so they can live a life of servitude. Would you rather live your whole life abused as a slave or not be born?

Wellthatsucks,fgfji8h,t1_fgersbv,1580740447.0,"Yall some goobers lol, only people who dont watch football have takes like this. 95% of the time the first down celebration is literally just pointing across the sticks. Theres literally no celebration if its a regular play. The touchdown celebrations last 30 seconds tops and happen 5-10 times a game so honestly idek what youre talking about."
nfl,fgeijyo,t3_ey0e0e,1580700334.0,As a texans fan i never lost faith in the chiefs. You can limit that offense all you want but theyre so explosive theyre never really out of the game.
circlebroke2,fgawdov,t1_fgakqsl,1580656126.0,I think i actually lost a couple iq points reading that
