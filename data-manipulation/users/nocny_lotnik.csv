Sometimes they need a jump-start to start talking and most teammates will listen. There are of course individuals who are convinced they alone will wipe opfor. They just don't know only Boris the Tesla Trooper can wipe half a team in certain conditions.

If you liked win7 you may like Zorin it's based on ubuntu and it's meant for newcomers used to windows (especially 7 imo). Also you could try Manjaro with cinnamon or xfce. Manjaro has a big repository. It's Arch linux based btw ;). Cinnamon has a nice feeling imo. It's smooth, clean and easy. It has a kind of kiosk were you can choose themes. Xfce is more customizable and lightweight. I would also recommend Mint with said cinnamon. Both DEs have graphic tools so it's easy to set them up your way by just clicking."

The answer is probably 'No'. But.. there are a lot of 'if's. If you're willing to make a compromise it's doable.

Playing linux native games is as expected - no trouble if you have every library needed. In most cases devs are providing with the game. In some you have to get them by yourself.

Playing windose games is tricky. Some of them won't launch, some will launch and run great and others will launch and run like shit. And some will lunch, run great but you get banned because of this anticheat thing.

In both cases having a GPU with vulkan support and good linux support i.e. AMD rx4xx/5xx or nvidia GTX10xx would be good.

That is why I would recommend a distro with large and fresh repos (I mean Arch btw) so you wont have to compile anything for yourself. Manjaro would be my choice. Endeavour OS is also great, but it is more like clean Arch thus less beginner friendly.

EDIT:

Worth mentioning are steam play/proton - thanks to this you can run windows games on steam without any hustle. Whole running windows games on linux is around WINE. Valves proton bases on wine. 

There is platform called Lutris which just wraps games in wine prefixes and automates launching."
