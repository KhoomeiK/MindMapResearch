aww,fegy0rg,t1_fegwrjn,1579105054.0,Oh yeah I'm sure a Dane could get out of a 4ft fence if it really tried but they're not exactly known to be escape artists haha. Not like a husky or something. It's just ridiculous the standards they have when even their fosters don't meet the requirements. They're the definition of letting perfect get in the way of good
aww,fegqazw,t1_fegnxkd,1579100016.0,"Ugh it's so frustrating. We know some people who had always had great danes. They're retired, have good income, fenced in back yard, travel but only to places that they can take their dogs. Literally the perfect home. They got denied by the great Dane rescue because their fence was only 4ft instead of 6ft.. because danes are obvious known for their jumping. /s They even asked if the foster home had a 6ft fence. Rescue said no.. foster didn't have a fence at all but they still required adopters to have a 6ft one!

They ended up going to a registered breeder after almost a year of trying. Rescues make it way too hard."
aww,fefo2q9,t1_fefihxj,1579060584.0,"Doesn't necessarily mean no one wants her. Rescues can be notoriously difficult to adopt from :/

dogs,fee47q0,t1_fedzwpo,1579026052.0,I feel kinda the opposite. I think diving into an adult dog who may have possible issues and/or having more difficulty changing bad/unwanted behaviors is worse haha.
dogs,fee3slz,t1_fee1ggz,1579025804.0,"I disagree on this. My dog LOVED daycare. And it's way better than sitting at home while I'm at work. A (good) doggy daycare is great and dogs love it so much if I could afford it I'd still take him even though I don't need it anymore.

Granted my daycare was amazing and only took so many dogs a day as to not get overwhelmed. Plus they have play groups of only 5-8 dogs at a time and they would rotate so everyone got down time and were only placed in groups where they meshed (for example elderly/lazy dogs wouldn't be in with crazy hyperactive puppies (mine))"
TwoXChromosomes,fe8d2rv,t1_fe6hm9m,1578924927.0,You literally can't win. Even if you have children because you want them you'll get judged. Just argued with someone the other day who was saying people having kids is selfish and wrong because of climate change.
houseplants,fdwauod,t1_fdtu2el,1578756843.0,That's good advice! They've been under our older set of grow lights before we upgraded so hopefully they'll be ok but I'll definitely make sure to keep a closer eye on them!
science,fds8n3a,t1_fds8agx,1578696854.0,"I have a feeling suicide survivors probably remember a general timeframe of when they decided ""I'm doing this"" and the attempt."
vegetarian,fdox51w,t3_emcypp,1578614890.0,Best bet is either protein shake or protein bar (you can find some decent ones with little fat a minimal net carbs at least).

WhitePeopleTwitter,fdlbktf,t1_fdl8c0o,1578520535.0,"My employer offers three plans. One that is high premium but low deductible that has copays, one that is high deductible but low premium that has no copays, and one that's in the middle of those two. I chose this plan because I pay like $20 a month and am a young, healthy person with no previous or current health issues. Plus all preventative/routine stuff is 100% covered. Its actually an amazing plan overall. I just decided the risk is worth it at the point in my life lol. Ultimately it's just ridiculous we have to worry about cost at all when it comes to healthcare"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdl6fh4,t1_fdl60vx,1578517841.0,I'm aware. But a lot of people have plans similar to mine where they have to pay thousands in deductible before before it switches to copay (which was the way the other plan offered by my company works).
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdkwpeb,t1_fdkvio8,1578512721.0,"The problem is that a lot of plans require you to hit your deductible beforehand. For example, I have to pay out of pocket $2700 before my insurance covers anything other than routine stuff. After that I 'only' have to pay 20%"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdkwgxa,t1_fdkupyk,1578512582.0,All depends on your plan. I have to meet my $2700 deductible before insurance covers anything other than routine wellness. After I hit my deductible I only have to pay 20%. Woo! /S
ZeroWaste,fde06fd,t1_fdcjy8o,1578328184.0,"I second checking out r/composting! 

Basically I keep a bin in my kitchen where we put food waste that's compostable. Then every week (or when it gets full) I will go dump it in our compost bin outside! Compostable waste includes things like: vegetable/fruit scraps/skins, apple cores, egg shells, coffee grounds, etc. Pretty much any food scraps that aren't meat or dairy can go in your compost (it's best to avoid meat products because it may attract wildlife. You can also put dead leaves and the grass scraps from mowing in there!

When we first started I was worried we wouldn't produce enough to really bother but between the food scraps, mowing, and stealing some leaves from our parents (we have no trees in our yard!) I was able to make enough compost to use for all my outdoor plants the next summer! It all adds up!"
ZeroWaste,fd6qkq9,t1_fd6puau,1578194510.0,"I add to it and let it decompose over the summer, fall, and winter. Then I use it in spring when we plant our vegetable garden or other outdoor plants (we planted some trees this year and used some!). 

This one has two compartments so you can fill one and while that's decomposing you can fill the other. Then, ideally, the first will be ready to use by the time the other is full so you can switch back and forth!"
ZeroWaste,fd6ordx,t1_fd6ln3k,1578193902.0,"That's a bummer! :( I did see some reviews about leaking but my SIL (who gifted it) has two of these and MIL has one and they haven't reported any issues so hopefully mine will work well too!

I don't mind a bit of leakage though since it probably won't be anywhere that'd be an issue (it'll be outside on dirt). My current compost bit (literally just a plastic storage bin I drilled holes in lol) leaks and I have to use a shovel to stir it haha!"
houseplants,fd5ylgc,t1_fd56dm9,1578183138.0,Yes! Pothos in the wild grows up trees and the leaves get huuuge!
houseplants,fd48otm,t1_fd482py,1578165365.0,I think you're right! Thank you! :)

houseplants,fcz96ae,t3_ejhl7x,1578096195.0,I am SO jealous of that silver satin and marble queen pothos! My HD only ever has golden and maybe if you're lucky a neon or two.
IndoorGarden,fcy9xvu,t3_ej7lxh,1578076855.0,[Me! ](http://imgur.com/a/3RBoS20) Lots of spider babies for now. Waiting for my pothos/philodendrons do get longer vines before doing them!

ZeroWaste,fcn4sfq,t1_fcmqsup,1577803261.0,Seriously? People don't want these absurdly large pieces anymore. They're all over my FB marketplace; people can't even give them away. At least this way it's getting used and stays out of a landfill.
houseplants,fckaqjy,t3_eh7m9g,1577721053.0,One bonus of having well water is no chemicals to worry about so I can use water straight out of my tap!
TwoXChromosomes,fciagqf,t1_fchjxez,1577659746.0,"I'm confused. The fact that you say the service is invaluable for those who aren't ready for children, etc means they you support that these services be available which seems like pro-choice to me. You can be pro-choice and be personally against abortion as an option for yourself. Pro-choice just means you believe everyone should be able to make that decision on their own. 

Pro-life means you would believe pregnant women do not have a right to choose to terminate."
houseplants,fbygzuy,t3_eex9o9,1577216660.0,I bought a table lamp and put [this](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Lighting-93101230-Balanced-Spectrum/dp/B07NN6SVG6/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3SI5D5WTQHCA2&keywords=ge+grow+light+bulb&qid=1577216283&sprefix=ge+g%2Caps%2C1190&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEySU40Q0dVMkxRUElKJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjYwNDgzVTRBREI1UFpQNk4wJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA1NjMwMzEzMk5VT0JITzUwMjdLJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) bulb in it. It has a normal color (not red/purple) and works well. I also bought a simple outlet timer so it'll turn on from 7a-7p. That way it gets consistent 12 hrs light even on weekends/when I'm gone! [Here's what it looks like.](https://imgur.com/ad7xGXk) One of these days I might get a not cheap lamp that the bulb truly fits in but oh well lol.
