mormon,ffcl6wl,t1_ffcj0ez,1579801810.0,"I will NOT down vote. I stand with you brother. It disgusts me as I’ve seen this type of blind eye turned. I was a conservative baptist before I joined the LDS church... I’m thoroughly disgusted at their lack of compassion, empathy and just plain unwillingness to HELP those less fortunate. If people like you... and me, don’t speak out there will be no change. You know what I get for speaking out? Shunned... is that anyway Christians are suppose to behave? Rhetorical. I stand with you."
aww,ffck5uw,t3_esw6rc,1579801187.0,What a beauty!!<3 such a love... congratulations mum and dad :) you did a great job :)
cats,ffcjs70,t3_esw7cb,1579800959.0,This sweet baby looks like he’s got a cat cold... (s)he is a beautiful little void. I use to think cat colds were just like human colds-they make you miserable but they eventually pass... with cats it’s very serious. My kitty had a cold and discharge from his eyes and nose... he was coughing and sneezing. My BF came over for a visit and noticed my fur baby and immediately alarmed me and explained. I took him to the vet that day and he needed antibiotics and steam to help his congestion. He was miserable and very sick and would have died had I not taken him in. The vet said that colds in cats was like influenza to humans...dangerous. I hope your sweet fur baby gets better soon.
aww,ffcag50,t3_esuvky,1579795196.0,That’s beautiful <3 I love seeing these types of photos. Thank you so much for sharing and putting a smile on my face :)
aww,ffb7ad3,t3_eso3yu,1579753743.0,"Awe, he will be okay Mama... he’ll be just fine and heal up and have many toys to play with after... he’s a handsome boy. Best of luck... sending love and positive thoughts <3."
cats,ffb6emn,t3_esnsxx,1579753024.0,"Awe, he’s a pretty orange tabby. I had an orange tabby and I have to say they’re some of the sweetest tabbies ever. <3"
TooAfraidToAsk,ffb69gy,t3_esntar,1579752914.0,"You are definitely NOT too old and it brings smiles to everyone, don’t stop... it makes you happy as well and you sound gifted. Keep doing what you love. Keep spreading the smiles:) Don’t let anyone stand in your way!"
cats,ffaygb4,t3_esmmif,1579747402.0,"First off, may you have peace in your heart and mind and keep your boy in your memory so he continues to lives on. 
Those are interesting dreams and dreams are interesting... it sounds like you and SO are processing your loose in your subconscious and this is how you both do it. A lot of people process their losses this way. You both loved your sweet boy... you both were extremely emotionally connected to him. When I loose loved ones I dream of them as well. I had a deep connection with my grandfather and he knew he was dying... He died (I hadn’t known it yet)  and that night I slept I dreamt of him coming to me... in an 19th century style store... bright light and he saw me and I him... he held me and said he was okay and not to cry... The next day I got the dreaded phone call that he had passed.. Coincidence? Who knows? But we were connected and when he left he told me... in my heart I know it was him. I processed his death and remember him fondly. 
I’m sorry your sweet baby was poisoned. My boy passed that way as well... I was devastated. I think it’s like you said, you and your SO were very emotionally connected..."
cats,ffawmxf,t3_esmc8s,1579746203.0,"Okay, well this was an accident so please don’t be hard on yourself. I think what’s most important is to get him to a vet in the morning... as soon as you can. I read that you and hubby share a car so unless he is howling... leave him and keep the lights and sound down low so he isn’t stressed. But regardless take him in... it could be broken and only a vet cat examine and make that determination. One thing about cats is they’re extremely stoic and most times don’t make much noise even in the worse pain."
cats,ffaw2md,t3_esmcas,1579745826.0,"I couldn’t agree with you more. I’ve had cats all my life and they are amazing fur babies. Currently I have two but we just lost two different times last year. Over the years that I’ve had cats, I’ve had them do similar cat things like purr or knead but all were...different. I had one that would ride with me on my dirt bike... as long as it wasn’t too fast he just sat in front. Unique for sure.  One that came to his name, fetched and walked my whole 11 acre property with me all through the day while I worked on the fence. He was my cat-dog.  Cats are indeed marvelous creatures... <3"
gardening,ffasnpv,t3_eslxx8,1579743569.0,OO she’s so pretty! How often does she bloom?
TooAfraidToAsk,ffartty,t3_esljgy,1579743008.0,"I have at times severe IBS and when my stomach hurts I will vomit from both ends...always. It doesn’t happen very often but it happens. Also when I was in labor and my contractions hurt so badly it also made me vomit and if I was able to, from both ends. I have since had many visits with the doctor and this is normal for anyone with a sensitive stomach and a response to pain as my doctor has said. Not everyone is like this so it can be weird I suppose for people to hear it. When you go to your primary care practitioner next, tell them what happens to you. Make sure it’s not anything serious. Be well."
Outlander,ffajyrh,t3_eskk7u,1579737611.0,Awesome!!! I’m thinking of starting 4 over to get ready for the 5th season coming out on February 16th!! The droughtlander will finally end...at least for awhile... lol Happy Outlander:)
cats,ffael4r,t3_esjdfc,1579733833.0,Her favorite wet food and catnip... she may be shy like my kitties over the years it is frightening and I’m sorry this has happened. Do you have a basement? I ask because it’s pouring here where I am and my little man got out and was gone for 24 hours... somehow he got into our basement... it’s unfinished and we have no idea how. He is a shy kitty and would not come or utter a sound to let us know. Catnip and the smells of that we sprinkled thickly all around outside. Then I put wet food on the porch... I understand if you can’t leave either out... it could attract unwanted guests. But I think it helped me. I hope she comes back soon. Don’t give up.
cats,ffae0pq,t3_esje81,1579733381.0,"Hahahahaha.... my kitty does this too when he’s sleeping... lol he’s not broken, it’s just comfortable for him this way... lol"

TooAfraidToAsk,ff8sogb,t3_esaw2i,1579694580.0,"It sounds like he’s being manipulative. At first when I read this I thought; he’s immature. Perhaps he is both? The point is, it’s not your problem, not even a little bit. If you aren’t interested that should be the line in the sand and he should stop any advancements. Not guilt you into going out with him."
aww,ff7zhe6,t3_es5l9k,1579662079.0,Bahahaha yeah totally :)

plantclinic,ff793un,t3_es1ocs,1579643613.0,They need orchid inserts/pots and orchid soil. Their roots look water logged and needs to dry out. https://www.repotme.com/pages/orchid-care-10 this site can help you bring life back into those orchids. Do you know the exact orchid? It will be exciting to get them healthy and blooming :)
aww,ff77wfb,t3_es1do0,1579642863.0,Hi Misty!! I like your Stitch :)
cats,ff74qzn,t3_es0rf3,1579641097.0,"You are doing the right thing by loving and petting her and keeping her safe and isolated from other kitties. I did find this https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.wikihow.com/Calm-a-Cat-in-Heat%3famp=1 and would highly suggest a good organic catnip CustomKittyCreations Catnip 16 oz/Fresh Premium Canadian Catnip (24 Cups) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071XSB2FZ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_pH2jEbKVXQQ7J ... I have had kitties all my life and one thing that has helped in many cases was catnip. Catnip when eaten gives a sedation effect and helps them and when they smell it it makes them frisky. Catnip is safe for cats and they will self regulate so don’t worry about ‘being too high’ lol it doesn’t affect them that way. I hope all goes well with her spay, best of luck with your new fur baby :)"
crochet,ff7348q,t3_es0tba,1579640164.0,I love that yarn as well but you’re right it’s a thinner gauge. I’d make a summer tank top because of the variegated yarn... something like this https://www.windingroadcrochet.com/goldenrod-tank-top-free-crochet-pattern/ or something like it... or something summery:)
aww,ff71nst,t3_es0frs,1579639347.0,You bet he is <3! That look and he’s taking it all in :)
cats,ff71gyl,t3_es0h06,1579639241.0,"Awwww, I’m sorry for your loss... keep your fur baby in your memories and put your heart and mind at peace. <3"
cats,ff719pv,t3_es0jej,1579639122.0,"He peed in pain? I want to help but I don’t understand exactly what you mean? I’ve had neutered cats all my life. This will happen from time to time with some neutered kitties. I had one that got UTIs and would cry and pee blood. Sometimes their penis is unsheathed when they are in pain and straining. This sounds like he needs to see his vet and pronto. IF it is anything to do with his kidneys it is urgent. Usually humping after they’ve been neutered means they are asserting their dominance. Are there any other kitties in the home? Female kitties will also on occasion do this as well, regardless of being spayed."
aww,ff6zt66,t3_es0e2a,1579638268.0,Look at that fur for days!!!<3 what a beauty! I have his twin on my profile... my fluffy black void is named Thackery Binx and he’s 11. What’s your beauties name? :)

TooAfraidToAsk,ff60k80,t3_eruqru,1579616019.0,Do not hate the ‘Chinese’... it’s not the Chinese people... look at their government and point the finger if you must find blame. Many countries have corrupt and horrible governments that cause the mass population to dislike them... but know who is to blame and who he should direct this “hate” to.
cats,ff606p3,t3_eruuu8,1579615722.0,"I have a very fluffy kitty boy and he did do this actually... I was thoroughly disgusted as cat poo is one of the grosses things. What I did was get my boy a sanitary cut. This helped. Also, she could be stepping in it, try adding more liter and making the liter deep... about 4 inches in the box. This may encourage her to dig deep and cover it more thoroughly and she may stop stepping in it (if that’s how she’s bringing it in). I hope either help. I wish you the best."

cats,ff5ylbr,t3_eruivn,1579614425.0,"Take your cat with you. First off, she won’t be traumatized from a 4 hour plane ride and will adjust nicely when she gets settled in her new home with you. I have moved all over the world with 4 cats and my cats all adjusted just fine. If she is truly your kitty, take her. Tell your mom you’re taking her regardless of what she thinks or says and that your kitty will be safe and fine."

Eyebleach,ff5xe85,t3_erdvyd,1579613406.0,The cheetah and the lab are raised together to help the cheetah with their anxiety. They pair cheetahs up with life long lab companions for this reason. It helps calm and settle the cheetah. I think it’s a great idea and has been proven time and time again to work.
