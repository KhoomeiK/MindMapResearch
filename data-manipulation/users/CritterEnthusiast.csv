PoliticalHumor,ffc85k9,t1_ffc5y5m,1579793737.0,"I know anecdotes don't really count, but I personally know too many people with degrees that are falling for this bs to fully agree. One of my good friends has a masters and she will sit here and parrot fox news all day long with no ability to comprehend she's in an echo chamber.  And even worse, she thinks her degree automatically gives her opinions more credibility. I love her but damn, it's hard to listen to her shit lol."
PoliticalHumor,ffc4iic,t1_ffc1ipt,1579791332.0,"It's weird watching this because it makes me self conscious about how stupid I probably am and don't realize it. The GOP is obviously banking on their constituents being too dumb to know or care they're lying, and they seem to eat it up just like they're supposed to. And that makes me wonder how many times I've been that idiot, totally believing something just because I want to lol. I would love to think it's never happened to me, but it probably has :/"
funny,ffc0cvx,t1_ffbzn6x,1579788283.0,"Do you think that accident would've happened the way it did if it wasn't for the cameras chasing them? Both things can be true, context matters.

Regardless, trying to paint Harry as a bitch because he's trying to do what's best for his family, especially considering the situation with his mom, seems extra cunty."

PresidentialRaceMemes,ff90ujz,t1_ff8r26c,1579701995.0,Michael Bloomberg could buy it twice and still be a multi-billionaire. I officially endorse Michael Bloomberg for the purchase of Fox News!
ABoringDystopia,ff8s88p,t1_ff8nbrj,1579694055.0,"I have a lot of Chinese friends who are young and work away from home in the cities. It's about to be their big new year celebration so most of them are home now with their families and I've been chatting with a bunch of them. They aren't living communally with all their closest relatives, but it seems very different than what we do here. They're just closer and seem to respect the idea of family more. It seems like their entire country shuts down for this big new year holiday, no one bats an eye at taking 1-2 weeks off work to go home to their families, their holidays are important to them like their family is. It's different than here. Our culture in the US is not like theirs, I don't think we value things like family and traditions and holidays like other countries do."
dogswithjobs,ff68drt,t1_ff5y1xo,1579621551.0,I've never talked to someone from Guam before! What's it like? Did you grow up there? What's an interesting thing a dummy like me probably doesn't know but is awesome/interesting about living in Guam lol?
holdmyredbull,ff44tf1,t1_ff3psqe,1579555552.0,"Watching this just gave me anxiety! I'm sitting here with my 4 year old son napping next to me thinking ""how can I possibly prevent future him from doing this"" because this is exactly the stuff I foresee him doing lol. Damn kids! ;)"
ABoringDystopia,ff3ttgh,t1_ff3o4le,1579548706.0,"Thanks for taking time to explain :) The thing that drives me crazy is that it seems like all the criticisms could be said about us too, so what are the actual downsides? When it seems too good to be true, it usually is. This might be one of the few exceptions I guess. Maybe the *too good to be true* part is it ever happening here lol"
ABoringDystopia,ff35q2l,t1_ff34jdu,1579534309.0,"I'm sure the quality of life here is amazing, as long as you're not working class. Is there anything you hate about your medical system? Things that are generally unpopular about it? There's gotta be a trade-off somewhere but so far I haven't heard of any."
ABoringDystopia,ff311jj,t1_ff2znke,1579530821.0,"That's the guy who was talking about Costa Rica, the guy I responded to had a different situation (that's why I thought he was in the US, but pretty sure I was wrong). It's so crazy to hear how it works in other countries. You probably don't even get buried in debt for going to college lol. Both medical and school debt are ruining my household, so that's fun :)"
ABoringDystopia,ff2vjyu,t1_ff2p9pz,1579525809.0,"I would think the most expensive healthcare bill you're paying is your insurance premium to have bomb ass coverage like that lol. Guessing you're covered through your job? Do you not even have a deductible?! I can't even imagine that kind of coverage anymore. Back before NAFTA when there were still factories in my area, pretty much anyone working full time had that kind of coverage. Not anymore :/

E: I just realized I may have misunderstood, are you from the US? This makes way more sense if not lol"
assholedesign,ff2tdu4,t1_ff2k52h,1579523368.0,"I've worked myself up to the top 1000 reviewers on Amazon, assload of helpful votes, and STILL haven't been offered a Vine spot! Been trying for 7 or 8 years now. 

But Walmart started a similar program and apparently it's much easier to get picked for that because I got a spot and I barely ever write reviews for Walmart lol. It's called Walmart Spark Reviewers. Go do a few reviews on Walmart and add pics to your review, that's all I did. I wasn't even trying for the program, didn't know it existed haha"
mildlyinfuriating,fexqfml,t1_fex6r84,1579434693.0,"I have a 4 year old son. Shitting isn't really the issue, it's the pee that misses the toilet seemingly all the fucking time lol. The bathroom is for bodily fluids, carpet is like a sponge...ew."

mildlyinteresting,ferh3lk,t1_feprcsm,1579353776.0,"You want real Mexican food? Come to Painesville Ohio and feast like you're across the border. Seriously, there was a big influx of Mexican immigrants that moved to the area in the 90s, now there's bomb ass food everywhere you look. There's literally fucking corn trucks that drive around town like ice cream trucks selling hot corn on a stick with cheese and stuff on it, and it's fucking delicious! Tacos stands everywhere, the liquor store is actually combined with a little Mexican grocery store and a burrito shop that makes burritos so big Chipotle would feel self conscious lol. There's plenty of good Chinese food too, American style and more traditional. But Painesville is like the northern extension of Mexico and I have to admit it's pretty fucking great. 

Btw, cost of living around here is so dirt cheap it's almost unimaginable compared to the coasts."
Eyebleach,fenohsh,t1_fennkoy,1579288580.0,"I mean I guess yes technically it could have happened. But if I had $5 left to my name and was forced to bet on this particular pic, I'm going with bullshit on the cat coming for help lol had they stopped at flipped its own ear I wouldn't be here calling shenanigans lol"
Eyebleach,fenmsnf,t1_fenh885,1579288015.0,"I have 4 cats and they shake their head or hit it with their paw when their ears flip. Of course I believe it can flip its own ear, it's the last part that's bullshit lol."

Eyebleach,fen7rff,t1_femsftw,1579278825.0,"These kinds of titles hurt my brain because I have no idea if they're just being silly and I'm being an asshole for not getting it, or if they want people to believe the person didn't just flip the cats ear and they're the asshole for making up dumb shit lol."
worldnews,feml4uh,t1_femj2cf,1579260960.0,Hey thanks for raising my blood pressure! Nice way to jumpstart my day lol I'm also real fucking tired of hearing those 2 excuses
politics,felmyu8,t1_fel8jfv,1579226039.0,"Yes. Your explanation is much more logical than the obvious one that virtually every person involved understood was happening. It would make a lot more sense if you could just once point to some other corruption he was so interested in combating. But no, only this one dude. Again, so weird."
politics,fel2hnx,t1_fekya5z,1579212636.0,"In response to edit 2: please name all the other corrupt people he's trying so hard to investigate lol. Weird how it's this one dude, weird how it's his main political rival, weird how with all the corruption in Ukraine, that's the *one* thing he cared to look into, weird how he actually only wanted it announced and not even actually investigated. So weird."
facepalm,fekzqv5,t1_fekqy2y,1579210987.0,"I think the goal is to educate people because an educated society is more productive and functions better. We used to not have compulsory high school, but somehow we mustered the courage to further educate kids into their teens, so why not their 20s lol. Doesn't even have to be compulsory, just optional would probably work pretty well."
politics,fekymci,t1_fekya5z,1579210309.0,"Maybe you didn't catch the news recently. He did it for *personal political gain,* not for the benefit of the country."
