If you cant naturally grow a beard then dont. A beard doesnt make you a man if that's why you're doing this. Also, a beard isnt some weird fashion statement that everyone can just have. You should be happy with or without one and dont go chasing after it unnaturally. It's like plastic surgery. It dont make sense. 

I got a balding head at 20. I ain't ever going to stick in hair implants or eat pills to make it grow back. Stay natural and work with what you have. I got a natural beard but no hair on my head. If you dont got a beard dont be dumb about it and start using treatments and shit. It ain't right and if you be honest with yourself you'll realize your reasons ain't right too."
