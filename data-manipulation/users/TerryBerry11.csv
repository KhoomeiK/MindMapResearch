fo4,fh5xxop,t1_fh5vwjj,1581293301.0,"Yeah. I really hope one day open world games can find a way to make it work where seasons change. I know that AC Odyssey somewhat made an attempt at that. Even though it’s not clear in game, based on the historical events that happened in the game you know that the game takes place over multiple years, and the main storyline somewhat tries to reflect that, by taking you on a path from summer regions to fall regions to spring regions on rotation in order. It’s not perfect throughout the game, but it’s close. That’s the closest I’ve seen a game come to it so far."
todayilearned,fh55rgx,t1_fh52f82,1581285263.0,"That sounds about right. I always feel safer lowballing numbers than highballing numbers, but I’m not complaining because it only reinforces my main point that people have a lot of direct descendants so it’s not really something that’s special. Especially when we’re talking about 900 AD Western Europe, where the population was in the thousands.

It’s why I don’t know why everyone in these comments is pointing out being a direct descendant of Charlemagne like it’s a big deal when it applies to every Western European with lineage earlier than 1600 in the region. Also I wanna know where they’re finding lineage records that date back 1100 years."

fo4,fh3z45p,t1_fh3dei1,1581273676.0,"Well Fallout 4 is mostly set in the fall/winter and 3 is set in the most heavily bombed area of the US, so in the context of the games the environments still makes sense. I’ve spent many falls and winters in New England and the trees do start to looks like they do in 4."
todayilearned,fh3lfky,t1_fh3l7jx,1581270056.0,"I knew it was way too low haha, I just didn’t know the number to give. The point being is that it’s gonna be a really high number."
todayilearned,fh3g0ba,t1_fh3bw4d,1581268604.0,"Afik it’s very hard to trace direct ancestry from 900 AD because the record keeping then isn’t what it is now. The closest I think a person could get is tracing direct lineage to someone who was a known direct descendant of Charlemagne back when that was more common knowledge in family lines, then drawing the assumption from there.

Like someone said though, that’s gonna be a lot of people with Western European heritage, especially because the population back then was a *lot* smaller than it was today, and a lot of people with Western European heritage are descended from that small population.

Also, look at it this way; a person alive today has roughly 100 people they’re directly descended from in the 1600s. My number could be off because it’s an estimate but it’s a high number in that range. Direct descent isn’t as exclusive as it might sound."

I have a hard time stating my opinions on things regarding the LGBT community on Reddit that I don’t have with people offline, which is crazy when you think about it, because as progressive as most redditors like to see themselves as, this website has created an environment where people from minority communities can’t express their own opinions on topics relating to them without being attacked for not following one mindset. It makes me intimidated to express my views, quite frankly, because of how mostly non-LGBT redditors will come after me.

NoahGetTheBoat,fh2mvay,t1_fh2i4fw,1581258067.0,"Which I don’t think should be how the group is lumped together. As a gay person I don’t really have anything in common with a transgender person, no matter how much I support them. Not every gay person feels the same way about them or those under the ‘+’ community either. 

It’d be as if every non-white person was lumped under the category “minority” and therefore should all be viewed the same way, have the same stances, experiences, and cultures of each other.

At the same time, she already forgave the affair, so the funeral should be a lesser concern. That being said, I understand how it can feel different, I think the idea of him going makes it all real, which I’m sure she hasn’t fully grasped yet. 

I know this sub takes the polar opposite stance on cheating that AITA does, and is a little too lenient on cheaters, but the thought of a significant other having a child with another person while you two are together should be enough to make anyone want to keep them and their family’s distance from the other one.

I guess for me I just have a different experience with everything. My uncle and some of my closest friends are black, my bf is Hispanic, some of my other closest friends are Asian, and I'm 1/4 Middle Eastern through my mom. To me, if I were to be racist or prejudice, if would be at the cost of hurting some of the most important people in the world to me. For this reason, I always look at individuals, not race. 

But I agree, especially with this part here:

>When black people are being shot to death by police for ""looking suspicious"", when hispanic people are being accused of being illegal immigrants and threatened with deportation, racist insults against those groups of people reinforce that as being okay

My friends, as well as my bf, and I all playfully make race jokes to each other, but that's an understanding between us. When people mean them as insults, it's an issue. 

To me, I don't get offended by the stuff like ""white people can't cook"". What bothers me is when people assume, because I'm white, I'm as racist and as bad as the worst of white society, when in reality I'm just trying to get to know the person as an individual and would like them to do the same. I also understand that not everyone is comfortable with that based on personal experience, but I believe that until everyone stops making blanket assumptions about a person to hold them in a negative light, all based on skin color, we won't be able to reach a society that moves away from racism. That being said, some other big factors there are police brutality against minorities and the idea that all people from south of the border shouldn't be able to emigrate to America, among other things. 

I mean this is exactly what the OP of the AITA post did, he assumed because a white girl didn't want to talk to him she had to be racist. She could've been, but he acted like it was a fact when she never said a thing about race, for all we know he just had an abrasive personality and didn't realize. But that whole situation is hard to judge without having been there.
