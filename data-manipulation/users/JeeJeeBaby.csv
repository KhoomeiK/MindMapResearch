> I have no problem with a reduction in profit. I have a problem with the illusion that something entirely unprofitable is ever going to be a realistic goal to get society to move towards out of some decision that animals must all be free and without human care. 

If something is morally wrong, the only acceptably moral standpoint is that it should be abolished immediately. People own other people for profit, you'd never argue that society needs time to phase that out because it's not realistic to do something so unprofitable. Of moral issues of the past, I doubt there's a single one that you'd say you're glad was phased out slowly."

This doesn't mean anything by itself. What do you mean? Please, just try to explain what you're talking about.

I don't see how these aren't contradictions. Are you just not okay with them breeding them to be any MORE of an abomination? The current level is acceptable?

>Do I believe that means they should be forced to die out or that the animals are necessarily suffering any more than they would in a wild environment? Also no. 

Then why not plan to breed them with wild sheep to make it so they can survive alone?

> They otherwise lead happy and healthy lives provided they're not mistreated, which they're generally not because it screws up their coats. 

This is a nice thing to believe, but it's not true. As long as they're fed, sheep grow their coats. If a sheep isn't able to grow a coat profitably enough, it's killed for its meat.
