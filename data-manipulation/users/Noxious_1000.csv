trees,ffgmqz7,t1_ffg7hig,1579909845.0,But fuck me is that cali worth it in blazed to fuck rn
trees,ffg7hig,t1_ffg63n9,1579900115.0,"In my dreams, on a ski trip to Canada in Feb so definitely will be sampling the local bud ;). Quality of our local grown stuff is fantastic but it is expensive. Can't wait until it's legal."
AskReddit,ffesyat,t1_ffdprcv,1579864044.0,There's an identical thread on breaddit that this bird just posted on.
trees,ffeqc2g,t1_ffe1vvk,1579860210.0,Yeah that's about right if not more. £55-65 an eighth. It's a rare commodity. Top tier UK grown bud is about £30-35 an eighth.
NetflixSexEducation,ffdrhqd,t1_ff6k4mc,1579827137.0,No it's honestly like this most of our cops are awesome and pretty chill. Of course there's a couple who'd do you over for having a gram of mj but most are nice.
NetflixSexEducation,ffdrdrf,t1_fewm3hz,1579827063.0,I'm not gonna lie I was appreciating the sexual harassment storyline up until that scene. It really did make guys seem predator like. I felt like a cunt just being male and watching that and I thought it was a bit over done.
NetflixSexEducation,ffdr7qk,t3_eptmwm,1579826956.0,"As a quite politically incorrect person who doesn't really give a fuck about sexuality/ me too etc I'm really surprised that I found that the show hit the spot almost perfectly. Don't take me out of context here 60% of my mates have turned out gay, it's the in your face shit I really can't stand. But I didn't find it overbearing at all, of anything it made it more interesting. The only thing that I found really fuckin obnoxious was all the girls coming together and talking about how all guys must want to whip their cock out. I thought the initial sexual harassment story was perfect in its portrail of the situation and the aftermath but I did think that scene really over did it. I'm excited for season 3. That is all."
AskReddit,ffdiafb,t3_esr647,1579821452.0,"Schoolwork, I'm good at my subjects, I should be getting 3 A*'s.

I'll get to uni, where I'd imagine it'll be the same, and then I'll join the air force and that will stop for a while as a pilot. And that's my plan. My lack of stress drives my dad nuts."

trees,ff8rg9j,t1_ff7v1av,1579693105.0,Taken a few tries and a couple of friends to get me on his list but worth it. My guy puts a menu on his story every evening. Good UK bud and then expensive Cali stuff too

EuropeanArmy,fe3f3hu,t1_faiaio6,1578848740.0,"Because some of us are proud of our current nations army and what it represents. Especially if it has links with a crown etc. Different training régimes for different cultures and different equipment for each countrys needs. The EU contains many countries, some of them poles apart in ideology and culture, so to have a universal army doesn't make sense. Just like the EU parliment doesn't make sense."

I am aware it has different effects for everyone but for ME it's easier to socialise when drinking and it's better to relax when smoking. Although it's an experience I wouldn't choose to go clubbing stoned regularly nor would I choose to drink over smoking when I'm just relaxing with friends. Drinking makes me more friendly, don't get me wrong, it makes some people violent, but I've never had any violent feelings when drunk. I just find it hard to steer my own body sometimes."
trees,fctzqor,t1_fctzo3n,1577967395.0,"Now don't get me wrong I love drinking as well and for clubbing and pub culture I think it's more friendly and I feel more talkative and active, but I prefer to walk out into the woods and smoke around a campfire."
trees,fctzo3n,t3_eiu3kj,1577967310.0,"I think this so much. We have a real problem with drinking in the UK. We start young 15 or 16 usually, clubs and pubs at 17, it can be great fun. But there are fights in he streets every night, and every time is a drunken guy. When I smoke I usually do it with a couple mates and we just sit and chill, listen to good music and eat. I feel completely in control of myself but everything is enhanced dramatically, the experience is usually slightly more intense but yet easier to play it off. The most amount of trouble I've caused is getting thrown out of a club because I couldn't work out where to put my jacket on Halloween. After all this my parents would probably disown me and I wouldn't be able to get a job in the RAF, despite it having less of a lasting effect than alcohol. We're not far from legalization thank god."
TooAfraidToAsk,fctx7yr,t1_fcsshce,1577964127.0,"Exactly, I was completely closed off to people all the way through high school and it's taken until now when I feel comfortable being a normal 17 year old, sneakin into clubs and goin down the pub with my mates. I'm so much happier now than I was but some people take alot longer than others to get there. Took me a long time. Just keep being patient and kind, you seem like a nice person, people will open up. ðŸ‘"
unpopularopinion,fcsqpbo,t3_eijytn,1577922692.0,I see so many people crying about how much it sucks to be a millennial and tbh I just smile inwardly and ignore it. It's such an awesome period of technological advancements at the moment that I find it hard not to be excited about the future and my part in it. People just need to see the bigger picture I think they're too caught up in their own self pity.
college,fcsnbu5,t1_fcqdt45,1577920286.0,"Doing that much work a day ends up being ineffective as your brain can only take in so much information at once, you also start to struggle with the work and this is frustrating and may contribute to some of the stress you are feeling. Make sure to take a long lunch break and take 5 minute breaks every half an hour or 10 minute breaks every hour. Try to cut down on the amount of studying you are doing by an hour or two. Either use this extra time to sleep or socialise, both these things will help improve your mental state and the work you then do during the day will be more effective and make up for the lost hours. Good luck mate, I have a hard year with my A Levels in the UK coming up but I'm trying not to worry too much. PM me or a chat"

TooAfraidToAsk,fcny44g,t1_fcnxwiz,1577820695.0,Girls are often more open to new people and better at making conversation than guys. If you start the convo and maybe drop a compliment or something they're more likely to talk.
TooAfraidToAsk,fcnxwiz,t3_ei5sew,1577820586.0,"Listen man, be patient. Speaking with my mates is easy, but take it as a sign that they're probably very nervous. Guys really aren't sure where to tread nowerdays and are really uncomfortable talking to girls. I don't know what it is, but when a girl engages you in conversation your stomach drops, butterflies, stuttering, the works. Sometimes a few words is all I can manage and trust me it pisses the guy off as much as it frustrates you. Be kind say nice things and they will open up. But it can be nerve-wracking being a guy and being expected to make the first move, not push it too far, not appear weird or too interested. Sometimes it's easiest for them to pretend they don't care."

unpopularopinion,fcn313j,t1_fcn2qnn,1577801862.0,I'll be careful here because our class system in the UK is very different to the US. He probably comes from a middle class family but that doesn't necessarily mean he's had an easy ride here. Our top social class 'elite' would probably have an income of Â£150k+ a year but it's more about what the family does socially and who they know. I don't really know his background but it's probably middle class 50-150k a year.
