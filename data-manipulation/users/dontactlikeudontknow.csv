business,ff6vuky,t3_erusq5,1579635936.0,"What?  None of this is right. Amazon  is definitely the problem with regards to counterfeit. Additionally, If you have a good product for sale as a third party Amazon seller, then Amazon will copy your product and list it for a lower price. At the bottom of your product page they will put an advertisement for their version with the lower price as a recommendation for something customer that the should consider instead."

lostgeneration,ff5sr6f,t1_ff5s0w6,1579608842.0,"Agreed! We should bring back building duplexes around smaller main street areas. This will bring work to a lot of small time tradesmen, not just one large corporate company. And the rents end of being cheaper, with the small amount of profit going to an average person saving for retirement instead of a large corporation."
lostgeneration,ff5sh4k,t1_ff56lkl,1579608535.0,That's not how rent control works. What rent control really means in that your rent will go up 3-5% regardless because landlords are hedging future losses. Also affordable housing doesn't really get built. It is made as housing stock becomes older and less desirable.

I don'tsee how she was even using personal information to do this good deed?. It seems that after she said she was willing to help, he TOLD her ""this is where I am- Please come help me.""  How else could she know where he was?? The info in the database didn't tell here what gas station he was at (unless I missed something? ). What other information could she possible need to do this good deed? I don't even see how she needed a first name. Just go to the station and hand money to the guy sitting out by his car looking stranded and asking people for change!

Sincerely looking to understand this better.

unpopularopinion,femtt4s,t1_fekotxi,1579269400.0,"It's because American football is basically social lubricant. You have 2 min of commericals to chat and then when you feel like you dont know what to say anymore, there's one minute of football. It's a godsend for awkward people. When watching football is not considered rude to stop talkin abruptly to focus on the game. Baseball too. I have social anxiety and I feel so much less stress going to a party where people are watching football. Also all the commercials are an excuse to drink, which perpetuates the sport for many. There's a whole bunch of people out there who just need any excuse to drink on a Sunday afternoon. And then every once in a while there's a play that's actually really exciting and you get to jump up and down and yell and fist bump your friends for absolutely no reason. Which of course gets the adrenaline pumping, and makes people feel like the game is more fun than it really is.  Seriously though, if you are watching this and you have social anxiety you should really get into sports. It's helped me so much. It does take a little time to get into it but usually fans are more than happy to explain to you, which gives you something else to talk about."

LifeProTips,feidd2n,t1_feic6hd,1579135872.0,"Also there is exciting new research on low dose ketamine for this and other anxiety disorders. It's already been approved for depression. It's the first new treatment in a long time and has shown to be helpful for people resistant to other treatments. Note that research is in early stages for anxiety and sample size is really small. Still super exciting.

StudentLoans,fegyeml,t1_fee0as3,1579105293.0,I've missed my email before... it gets lumped in with junk mail because I get like 10 -20 emails a month from these people. It's hard to weed through the noise when your not sure when it's coming (my date had migrated over the years to different months than it started).
financialindependence,fe957dc,t1_fe87iwb,1578934310.0,"Not true. Its 20k on healthcare, 25 - 30k on very modest housing or or 30k - 40k for something more average (plus maintenanceif owned), 31% 38k (actual percent paid last year on 87k, should be more for 122k) goes to taxes, plus property taxes, the car to get to work (including insurance) 6k (many jobs at this level require a late model car). 6k- 12k student loans. So after tax 122k becomes 84k - 20k + 30k +6k +6k = so we are down to 22k and haven't paid any utilities, no food, no clothes for the nice job, no gas to get there, no pets, no kids, no really expensive medications. No computer or phone. No gift to an aging parent needing help. No life insurance, disability, etc. No christmas budget. You get it. My point is... it's not toys!!  Life is hard even at this level. And that really says something about our terrible system."

oneanddone,fdw9qvm,t1_fdtszvx,1578756523.0,"I mean having siblings can really suck. I'm pretty sure a great deal of my unhappiness has a child came from my parents overextending themselves for another child.  Also my younger sibling was a problem child that has drama with everyone, always in trouble, etc. We've never been close and when I was a kid I wished that I was an only child, a desire that I felt guilty for. That's why I will be OAD. Buy the kid and extra puppy if he's lonely. Pretty sure most kids would prefer that over a sibling, even if they don't know it."

Many of us are so frustrated that we have been protesting America's invasion of the Middle east for 20 years and politicians don't care. Many of us outraged and feel helpless and at the mercy of our corrupt government. The government also knows that it's hard for us to do anything of significance to fight back when we are struggling to afford the basics like healthcare and are terrified to lose our jobs.
