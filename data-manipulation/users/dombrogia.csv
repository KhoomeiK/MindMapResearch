If I needed to do some sort of processing that is a long running process when a request is received, message queues would be helpful. In regards to your ""Option 2"", you realistically won't run large calculations and return their response in the same request. Do you want to wait the 50 seconds for your large calculation to finish?

>Do you allow the two APIs to communicate or does this get tricky with user handling?

If it were up to me, I keep one API until I can't -- 99% of the time one API will suffice unless you are enterprise and then this isn't a one person job and there are a lot of factors that are out of scope / not included in your question. 

If I *have* to have a second API, I'd try my best to relay to it through the first API so that I only have to have one public facing application. It locks it down and keeps the scope of what it does very focused.   


IME, this scenario isn't impossible, but it's less common than you'd think. If you're lucky enough to need to scale an application, the web nodes (REST controllers, etc.) will be the easiest to scale. They're just stateless so you can run multiple servers in parallel. What gets hard to scale is data since it is the state of a backend application. You get into [CAP Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem), data sharding, read replicas, multiple database connections, caching, etc. This is a slippery slope to being out of scope of REST however.

So in order or us to play the game together we have to do everything twice. I’m assuming it’s the same for the bosses as well which is a PITA for story progression. 

I can’t even exit the white soap co-op thing to hit the checkpoint we got to after exploring then rejoin after I have the checkpoint. I have to literally lose all of my progress with the exception of my souls that I acquired and I don’t get any items when I’m in his world, only he does. Also the merchant lady only has 3 embers so I’m screwed if I die and lose my ember because I have such a limited supply. 

I’m not sure if this poor co-op was intended or just a lacking feature — I keep reading “welcome to souls” when people are surprised by aspects of the game which seems like a bad excuse for when things are missing its intended to make things more difficult when in reality it’s just a major inconvenience.

That’s definitely a little bit of a rant (apologies), but also I’m so new to the game (~3hrs) so I’m genuinely curious if anyone else was hoping for a better co-op experience and how they’ve managed to run through the game with a friend. Online gaming is intended for playing with your buddies so I can’t imagine I’m the only one trying to do this and faced with frustration and curiosity

motogp,fci8o53,t1_fcfmd1e,1577659091.0,"I would like to see Rossi on a Ducati for a final year. I think it would also benefit him. The bike might not carry great corner speed but if Dovi can strategically stay in most races, Rossi would be able to as well. Dovi and Rossi are both great on the brakes and very similar in their will to endure the longevity of a race. Unfortunately I don’t think we’ve been able to see it recently with Rossi because he loses tenths on the straight of every lap. Miller and Dovi on the Ducati’s last year were hell for Rossi in the 4-5 spot in the first 10 laps consistently. Even when he makes a move he gets taken back immediately. Obviously if he qualified better like MV12 and FQ20 he wouldn’t have a roadblock in front of him, so part of it is definitely self-induced. 

I don’t think it would happen where Rossi moves there, but I would be glad to see it."

I canâ€™t even exit the white soap co-op thing to hit the checkpoint we got to after exploring then rejoin after I have the checkpoint. I have to literally lose all of my progress with the exception of my souls that I acquired and I donâ€™t get any items when Iâ€™m in his world, only he does. Also the merchant lady only has 3 embers so Iâ€™m screwed if I die and lose my ember because I have such a limited supply. 

Iâ€™m not sure if this poor co-op was intended or just a lacking feature â€” I keep reading â€œwelcome to soulsâ€ when people are surprised by aspects of the game which seems like a bad excuse for when things are missing its intended to make things more difficult when in reality itâ€™s just a major inconvenience.

Thatâ€™s definitely a little bit of a rant (apologies), but also Iâ€™m so new to the game (~3hrs) so Iâ€™m genuinely curious if anyone else was hoping for a better co-op experience and how theyâ€™ve managed to run through the game with a friend. Online gaming is intended for playing with your buddies so I canâ€™t imagine Iâ€™m the only one trying to do this and faced with frustration and curiosity

motogp,fci8o53,t1_fcfmd1e,1577659091.0,"I would like to see Rossi on a Ducati for a final year. I think it would also benefit him. The bike might not carry great corner speed but if Dovi can strategically stay in most races, Rossi would be able to as well. Dovi and Rossi are both great on the brakes and very similar in their will to endure the longevity of a race. Unfortunately I donâ€™t think weâ€™ve been able to see it recently with Rossi because he loses tenths on the straight of every lap. Miller and Dovi on the Ducatiâ€™s last year were hell for Rossi in the 4-5 spot in the first 10 laps consistently. Even when he makes a move he gets taken back immediately. Obviously if he qualified better like MV12 and FQ20 he wouldnâ€™t have a roadblock in front of him, so part of it is definitely self-induced. 

I donâ€™t think it would happen where Rossi moves there, but I would be glad to see it."
AskMen,fccd49p,t1_fcccn7n,1577597027.0,Meh itâ€™s just fake internet points anyways. Their dad sounds like someone who is concerned for their kids. She didnâ€™t point out anything malicious. Asking about someone and their family sounds pretty normal and harmless to me. Itâ€™s something we (hopefully) all have and should value.

HumansBeingBros,fcaj57y,t1_fca8m03,1577570169.0,"I think the majority of the people who benefit *directly* from the stock market (disregarding trickledown economics) are towards the top 10%. I think the majority of people in the service do not fall in that category (or at least not in their first 10 years in) so itâ€™s a conflicting question.

I think war or â€œconflictâ€ is inevitable so that isnâ€™t the problem (IMO). I think the problem is morals and what we are doing to cause our economy to flourish. And as long as Iâ€™m being honest, I donâ€™t really know what that is."

Also sac has potential. I donâ€™t know anything about either of their management or coaching, just think both have good young talent which is the first step of the process."

I donâ€™t think it was related to him, but the offense seemed to stop moving the few minutes he was in. No one was really moving"

What does murder rate mean? Murders per year or is that based on a ratio of population to murders?
