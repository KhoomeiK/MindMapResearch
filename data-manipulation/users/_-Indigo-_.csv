tifu,ffbbebj,t1_ffank10,1579758444.0,College classes start that early all the time. Especially if it's not undergrad. Once you get into a specific program they know they can do whatever they want.
Showerthoughts,ffb7p7i,t1_ffarg9a,1579754175.0,Same.... But I work at a pharmacy that dispenses Testosterone so we can all just hope and pray I never say it wrong out loud to a patient.
AskMen,ff7c5k8,t3_erlbbu,1579646106.0,He drove on the wrong side of the road. Thought we would die. We lived. Was awful.
AskReddit,ff5erxp,t1_ff5caus,1579589761.0,At least you care enough to be obsessive? Obviously too much is bad but people who don't get a little jealous or protective from time to time don't care.
AskReddit,ff5epy8,t1_ff5capk,1579589697.0,I don't know what to say to this except learn to love yourself and please don't ever kill yourself. Everyone has a lot of flaws. Fighting these flaws and hating them only brings misery and self hate. Learn to accept or overcome things you dislike about yourself and be the person you always dreamed you could be. Just a little at a time. It's doable in pieces. The world needs people who recognize the worst in themselves because they have the power to become the best people if they choose to.
AskReddit,ff5e53v,t1_ff4vexw,1579589040.0,"I kinda do the same. It's with particular things, there's just certain things I won't stand for in a relationship like cheating or lying... Playing games and manipulation. All that crap. Could not tell you how many relationships I've just walked away from at the first sign of those even potentially being an issue. They sometimes aren't even an issue yet, but I don't want to deal with it at all so I just leave. The worst part is I don't even give them closure. It's basically just ""dude I'm done, bye"" 

I should probably work on it ...."
AskReddit,ff5dv5g,t1_ff4rfr1,1579588735.0,"I feel like I can relate in some senses. Probably more so when I was younger and hated myself. Once I learned to love myself it was easier to believe others loved me too. Now I just suck, people feel so ""connected"" with me and I often feel little to nothing in return. It's been pretty lonely tbh. I hope you find someone you believe when they say those things and don't find yourself annoyed with the situation when you are with them."

AskReddit,ff5bz2l,t3_erjqnj,1579586705.0,"I would have missed leaving my now ex husband... He was abusive, cheated, raped me... I would have missed out on feeling like a human being again and having a life surrounded by friends and family."

PublicFreakout,feeraqy,t3_eon1n4,1579039533.0,Honestly I hate this. I'm a woman. I've been abused/raped by an ex husband. I was given so many resources. So much understanding. So much love. If only the world would fricking do the same for men because they deserve it just as much as I do/did. This makes me incredibly sad.

Overwatch_Memes,fe9lukc,t1_fe9k5z2,1578939271.0,"It's cuz some Doomfist players will literally camp healer when they spawn. Makes it impossible to get back to your team and ya know, heal them. A healer caught by themselves can't counter Doomfist even sort of. The only exception is Ana if she is fast enough and sees you coming which is unlikely. Cuz even Lucio's speedboost, Doomfist can catch you. You'll waste your ult on yourself if you are Zen. Baptiste is just screwed, you'll just punch him out of his immortality field. Moira might get somewhere but you'll catch her even faster than Lucio. Mercy can only escape if she has a teammate to fly to. Brig might be able to stall longer but her dps isn't enough to win a 1v1 with Doomfist. I imagine DPS players have similar issues when they get caught out alone if they don't see you coming. Doomfist tends to leave tanks alone tho"

MonsterHunterWorld,fdltxxh,t1_fdlshpa,1578532418.0,You got a solid point there
MonsterHunterWorld,fdjeups,t1_fdjeqot,1578467850.0,"You heard? You haven't played it? It's got a story, it's also got a grind for good materials, and it has side quests and multiplayer as well. It wouldn't be nearly as good of a game as it is if it all revolved around the handler and the story."
MonsterHunterWorld,fdjemah,t1_fdjeg2s,1578467579.0,They're NPCs in an action/adventure game tho. They're meant to be bland so you can focus on the adventure. It's not like Stardew Valley where you build relationships it's supposed to be about Monster Hunting. The Handler just fulfills a role that allows you to hunt monsters and follow a story. If they added a bunch of theatrics to her and made her less bland I think it would take away from the purpose of the game.
MonsterHunterWorld,fdjecsh,t1_fdje7ek,1578467277.0,Yeah I don't know who started the hate on the handler bandwagon but it seems like most of the player base subscribes to hating her. There's not even a good reason for it unless you really do just find her voice annoying.
MonsterHunterWorld,fdjdlyi,t3_elmb8c,1578466438.0,I really don't mind her personally. I did a playthrough with someone who hated her and them complaining made me enjoy the game less. I like that she's optimistic and easily finds herself happy. What else can you ask for?
AskReddit,fdjacd0,t1_fdhkahq,1578463131.0,I think that sums it up nicely.

AskReddit,fcryb8r,t3_eihliz,1577908293.0,"I look for empathy. They are less likely to hurt you if they are empathetic because they will think their actions through and know what will and won't hurt you. This also means when I cry, they might cry with me or at least comfort me and that's a huge green flag because it nurtures vulnerability in a relationship. If you can be vulnerable with each other, you can have trust and that's what a relationship really needs."

AskReddit,fcjh8ss,t3_ehcoiz,1577687514.0,"Ex husband lied about a lot, just everything about himself. I'd dare say he even went as far as studying how to hide things about himself and behave like a different person. He got sick of the act and things became increasingly abusive. He said terrible things that just broke my heart because I genuinely loved him and one day the physical abuse got really bad. I then found out he was cheating on me and just asked myself why I was still even there with him when he was treating me so poorly. I left him but the whole ordeal gave me PTSD and the thought of ever seeing him again haunts me. Obviously our marriage vows were lies and I meant nothing to him but to be a person to manipulate and get what he wanted from. Worst betrayal of my life."

AskReddit,fc25z9y,t3_eflpka,1577341921.0,"Applies right now. Left an extremely abusive relationship. Resulted in PTSD, so I got triggered easy for months after. The nightmares are still there but not frequent anymore. The worst of it, a daily reminder, is most memories from about 5 years of my life are just gone plus some random things I associated with that person. I would never have imagined that abuse could mess your brain up so much in such an unhealthy way that you just block out so much of your own life... I miss how foreign the concept of abuse used to feel."
