You just read one article and ready to judge... you probably read a headline, because I am pretty sure it is some fearmongering article about recent surge or refugees and Muslim immigrants... these were going around (please link, I can better say my opinion). Also suggest you to read UN report on women equality (you can download pdf version [here](https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2019/06/fund-for-gender-equality-annual-report-2018-2019)), some additional info can be found on [here](https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/progress-of-the-worlds-women). If you interested in specifically European countries you can find various topics on gender equality [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/gender-equality_en).

We have our problems, and there is rape and abuse everywhere, but we are also helpful, liberated and not afraid to fight it... and not afraid to differentiate healthy sexual habits from harmful behavior... instead of having binary view on everything (sadly US is very much like that)  I am not saying its perfect, but if you have a chance to talk to European people, and women in particular about attitudes to sex I suggest you do it, you might learn something.

maybe he is not fulfilling your needs and if you cant forget the past and try to start  fresh you should move on and try to learn from your mistakes before entering a new relationship...  and just try to think twice before bringing things like ""you don't love me enough"" up. maybe take a day to remind yourself, that these words have impact on him too and makes him doubt your his commitment, since it does not seem that you appreciate him.

YouShouldKnow,feh1nlg,t1_feelx1w,1579107276.0,"that cought my eye also, but tbh the whole definition section is off...

>""Ultraviolet light"" is a spectrum of invisible electromagnetic waves that are shorter than visible rays (the color spectrum) and longer than non-visible rays (X-Rays).

Visible light has approximate wavelengths of 750 - 350 nm, the longest wavelength being perceived as red ( ca. 750) (by standard human eye) and the shortest ones are blue-violet (ca. 380 nm) anything shorter than that falls under the definition of Ultraviolet until  ca. 10 nm where x-ray part of the spectrum starts, so saying it's between visible and non-visible rays makes no sense to me.  The division between these rays are not as sharp and does not occur at 1 very specific wavelength, it is all about the construction of the eye, and human eyes are not identical. (some animals see ultraviolet too or infrared for that matter). When broad spectrum ultraviolet light is emitted there is often some blue rays in the mix unless its very specific wavelength we are talking about (i.e. 250 nm), I think that's where the whole confusion comes from, because often we can ""see"" ultraviolet if it is broad spectrum, but only because we see the visible blue-violet light mixed in with it and we associate it with Ultraviolet (hence the name, extreme blue). Scientifically light spectrum is divided by the wavelengths and ALL the colors belongs to visible light. That's the only part of the spectrum we can see.  Ultraviolet also is sometimes referred as ""near blue"" for obvious reasons, which adds to the confusion.

Just wanted to point out that the definitions in the post are all messed up, and that is kind of important to understand what light is. Don't know about definitions of eye strain (limited doctoring knowledge), tho seems reasonable to me.

Abuse free speech for your advantage and then shut it down for ones who disagree, right from the fascist play book, and understandably, since its working.  sad state of affairs."

don't get me wrong I think Obama had a lot of issues, which people could point out, but giving valid criticism requires intelligent discussion, which these dumb asses are not capable of."

If you were smarter, you would think twice about peoples situations and could come up with a reasonable explanation for their suffering and hard times. There are perfectly valid explanations why she would care for her exes kids.

confessions,fed7m0z,t1_fdqbnwu,1579002612.0,"your point of view is not fine. I think you should seek help. let me try to say something in a way you understand: men often are not attracted to women who has no respect for other people (including women),  no self respecting man I know would want to complement such person as you, because when they compliment the opposite sex, they are aware of that it carries some connotation of actually also liking their personality and they are attracted to the whole (they are also less aware of fashion and things like that, so noticing definitely caries weight, mostly because they notice you firstly). Women are in general more generous with their compliments because they often don't attach physical attraction to it. Maybe they like an artical of clothing and think they would like to have it or they like overall look and want to be nice, maybe they would like to know where you got it or just similar things (women are more sensitive to women fashion since they have to also wear clothing). That's just it. men are more careful. So I think its your personality and lack of respect to others, that makes them not like you, not compliment you and be careful with you overall. Ugly insides sometimes outshine designer clothing. 

I get plenty compliments from women, which I take with pride, and compliments from men are mostly from my friends which I have established relationship with. If i get compliments from men I am acquaintance with it is usually obvious they are interested in me and sometimes just connected to their profession lifestyle (such as designers, people interested in fashion),or  just in general very positive guys who want to uplift people and express their feelings and emotions quite freely. 

&#x200B;

so i think you are really not getting a point of compliments. They don't compliment you, because they don't like you. who would anyways, you seem like a horrible person."

Mostly people are not just black and while. they show their good person in public and while interacting with people in the real, and here we see the dark parts or human psyche.. out in the open and with no shame... and I can say, i am also guilty of that sometimes, its a place to vent, to hate on people who are fucking idiot and bigots, to let stuff out... and for some its just a place to spread toxicity. there are so many wholesome stuff here too... however morbid curiosity wins sometimes... 

Find some good subs and try to pick yourself up.. also you should just understand that people will down-vote you no matter what, I have made post with most wholesome stories, and then people still down-vote, if you cant handle it, you should not be here."

Amazing how entitled assholes have ""hurt feelings"" and ""fears or their own sexuality"" as an argument.. without knowing absolutely nothing about the subject and being completely insensitive to other people suffering (and they suffer from this nonetheless). It makes me so angry, but at the same time, feeling of hopelessness comes over me.. I want to shout that they should deal with their own insecurities rather than blaming other people... but  its also obvious that there is nothing we can do sometimes, just wait for the inevitable death of generation of bigots, and the residuals thereafter... I bet if these people lived 20 years ago they would be spouting this about gay people...
