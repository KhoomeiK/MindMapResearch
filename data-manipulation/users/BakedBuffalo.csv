tifu,ffd10cn,t1_ffbgxqh,1579811290.0,"My boss brought in some deer jerky his butcher friend made him from his latest kill that was labeled ""Beyond Hot"".  Turns out his buddy used a whole fucking bottle of Mad Dog 357 when he made the batch.

It was hot as fuck and he didn't want it and no one else did, so he gave me the whole big ass bag.  The jerky was some of the best tasting I've ever had, but holy shit was it hot.  Like tears running, tongue-numbingly hot.  I can handle heat, as a matter of fact I just made my Jerk Pork made with Scotch Bonnets for the company Xmas party, but this stuff was HOOOT.  A little piece the size of a thumbnail would set your mouth ablaze.

Yesterday I was completely broke and couldn't afford food until I get paid Friday, so I ate the remaining 2lbs or jerky over the course of like 4 hours.  I'd eat a little bit until the heat was unbearable, suffer through the pain, then rinse and repeat when it cooled down.  I finished it off finally, and about a half hour later I started getting stabbing stomach pains.

This morning at work the pain was getting worse and worse until I finally couldn't take it anymore and went to the bathroom to take one of the most painful dooties of my life.  Today I'll be eating air, and I'll be grateful for it."

As much as reddit likes to think it's the hub of popular culture and has its pulse on the heartbeat of whatever subject matter the subreddit is devoted to, most people don't give a shit about reddit.  Red Dead Redemption 2 had 26.5 million sales, but the subreddit has only ~600k subscribers.  So out of every 44 gamers or so, 1 is subscribed to that subreddit.  Now, every community is normally split, so let's split that down the middle and now we have 1 in 88 gamers that might hop on Reddit and cry about a given issue.

I browse reddit on the reg and I'm aware of most of what a given game I enjoy's community is whining about.  There's always something.  But then again, if you were a cashier at a grocery store, every 1 in 88 people would probably be a douche too.  I've almost never heard any of my friends or people online in any game I've played in 20+ years that actually cares about any of the pedantic shit these nerds cry about, sans gamebreaking bugs and/or server issues."

politics,ff9zir5,t3_esb61e,1579724835.0,"Fuck Hillary, and Bill too.

They're single-handedly responsible for the mess we're in right now.  She couldn't beat Bernie fairly in 2016 so she rigged the primaries with the help of the DNC, then lost to Trump in perhaps the biggest political upset in history.

I would never, ever vote for Hillary, and many of my Democrat friends feel the same."
