No, my job isn't to support the users' needs. My job is to support the company's needs. Sometimes, those things align, like when their computer breaks. In other cases, those don't align at all, like fixing their home PC. Either way, a desktop background (no matter who decides it), isn't really needed. Obviously, if the user needs a bright or dark background for a legitimate medical need, it is different. Either way, I'm changing their background because the company has to comply with this request, not because Suzy has an eye issue. However, that is rare. Most of the time when people complain about this, it's because they can't have a photo on their screen.

I happen to agree with you that mandating backgrounds is usually dumb. Let people have some control over their environment. As long as it's SFW, who cares?"

While dogs should probably be leashed when in urban/suburban environments, saying they should always always, always be leashed is a little extreme.

dogs,fel13fu,t1_fekyjn5,1579211786.0,"> black lab would work.

I agree with this. Black dogs tend to be more intimidating. You can train the dog to bark when it hears a knock on the door (we did that with my black lab). Just encourage them to get all excited. Or, teach them how to bark on command and then tie that into knocking or the doorbell. We were able to get my black lab to go nuts when we asked him, ""Who is here?""

I don't know if it's really that great of an idea, but we trained that black lab to be protective if someone got physical with my wife. Again, get them excited and encourage them to play hard (bite) when someone fake attacks you or someone else. It's not really that hard to do. 

Really, a large dog barking at someone, even if they are wagging their tail, is intimidating. You shouldn't really have to train them much more than to be loud."

He's outside for 10 minutes or so, and then we come in. He gets fed, and played with for like 10 minutes. By now, my kids are up and my wife is out of the shower. So, they play with him and take him out while I am in the shower. Around 7am, he goes outside again. My wife leaves the house a little after 7am. He comes back in, and we play until 7:30 and then gets taken out one more time. I am out of the house by 7:45 to drop my kid off at school and then I go to work. 

My wife is a teacher and has a couple free periods in the middle of the day, about 50% of the time. So, we split coming home for lunch. One of us is home around 11:30 or noon. He gets taken out as soon as we get home, gets fed, gets played with for about 30 minutes, and then we take him out again. By 12:30 or 1, we have to leave to go back to work. 

My wife gets home about 3 or 3:30pm, and then we play and goof off until we go to bed about 10pm or so. One of us wakes up at 2:30am or so and takes him out halfway through the night.

Whenever we are not home, he is crated. He sleeps in a small play pen. Sometimes we will give him a peanut butter filled bone/kong. Most of the time when we are at work and check the camera, he is just laying around in his kennel. That is what he is doing right now."
puppy101,fegmjm4,t3_eoxxqt,1579097285.0,"Reminds me of one of our dogs...

I grew up out in the country. We had ~100 acres of woods around our house and we lived 1/4 mile off the road. We got our Britney Spaniel from the pound on a rainy New Years Eve day. The first day we had her, my father was grilling steaks on the grill right outside the basement door. The dog made it out the door when someone went downstairs and it took off. We've had this dog for about 4 hours now.

Now, my father had no emotional attachment to this dog. However, my mother couldn't just let our new family dog run out in the rain, get lost, fall in the half frozen creek, or get hurt. So, she took off after it, flashlight and leash in hand. The rest of us eat dinner, and are lounging around. About an hour later, a wet dog comes running up the basement stairs into the living room. YAY! My mother found her. Now we have a wet dog in the house, so we put her in the basement (it had a wood stove and we spent a lot of time down there in the Winter) and shut the door between the basement and first floor. 

About an hour later, my mother comes up the stairs, VERY wet from the rain, saying she had no luck finding the dog. We're all confused, because the dog has been home for an hour. She had left the basement door open just in case the dog decided to come back, but she didn't see the dog in the basement when she came home. The dog came home and laid around in the basement near the warm wood stove for an hour with the basement door open and my mother trudged around in the rain for about 2 hours for nothing."

Never tell the people they are about to get laid off. We are put in a shitty situation, but if they're on the chopping block, you telling them isn't going to save them.

Laid down in the car? You get a piece. We would supplement one of his 3 meals a day with it. Tiring him out a bit, but not too much, made him a little less crazy. Honestly though, he was a typical lab. He was nuts until he was like 3.

We lived in a relatively small town. Basically though, we took him everywhere. Stores, parks, the beach, hiking, and everywhere we could. He got to do so many fun and new things that he was always doing something. 

He had some separation anxiety. We would leave the room for a couple minutes, then come back. We worked on it for a couple months before he could go more than a couple hours. 

He wouldn't go up or down stairs. Ever try to carry an 8 month old hyper dog down stairs? Lol. Not fun. We would get him to do 3 stairs, then 4,then 6,then an entire staircase. It took a couple months before he would go up stairs that you could see through (like some basement stairs.) 


I didn't know as much about dog training at the time (it was 15 years ago), but he turned out to be an awesome dog. So, I did something right. He lived to be 14 and a half.

All that said, he was a great dog. Loving, friendly, and fun to play with.

I expect that it will be very nervous if it hasn't been exposed to ""city life"" before. Usually, the earlier you expose dogs to new experiences and settings, the better they are at coping with other new ones. If he hasn't been exposed to honking cars, lots of people, etc, you're probably going to have to work extra hard with him on that stuff."

My current lab is fine with the ferret we have now. If anything, the ferret picks on her. He runs up to her, bites a tail or paw, and the dog runs away. The dog doesn't want to play at all.

Shelters alter the dogs at 8 weeks because they don't trust all owners to get the dogs fixed. They don't necessarily have that individual dog's best interest at heart. They doing it for the general dog population. There is a significant difference between a shelter deciding to alter and a responsible owner.

The generally accepted idea is that you're making one trade off for another. Without a doubt, early altering (before they are fully grown) increases their risk for joint and ACL issues. Multiple studies have shown this. But studies also show alteration reduces the risk of mammary cancer. In breeds that are prone to cancers but good with joint issues, early spaying makes sense. In breeds that are prone to joint issues but not mammary cancer, a late altering probably makes more sense.
