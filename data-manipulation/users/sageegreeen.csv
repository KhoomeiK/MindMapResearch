CasualUK,ff3hlw2,t3_erfasm,1579541210.0,Do them 1 full time on max setting and 1/2 again. You’re not cooking them long enough if they’re rubbery. Then smother with LURPAK full fat. No reduced fat rubbish.

The high focus on her face in contrast to the particularly blurry back end makes it appear like her head is not attached/overlaid like a photoshop cut out/paste just a tiny bit. 

Otherwise EXCELLENT shot/angle and a beautiful model!"
AMA,fexuzwf,t1_fevnruc,1579436971.0,"Nah that’s a stereotype you’re suggesting. 
She definitely can’t handle the saw used for cutting but she does happen to be smaller to get into tighter/ smaller spaces.
Her resilience is there, she just doesn’t have the same strength/height as the men."
AMA,fevmz6j,t1_fevbvnh,1579399196.0,"Whilst I disagree women shouldn’t be fire fighters, I can agree that tests were simplified for female to reach equality in the force. 
Source; my husbands a fireman in the North West, UK and I was pretty annoyed when he told me. 

My reasoning is that for equality, women should be entering on the same level as men, not having exams/tests ‘dumbed down’ to help them. 
If a woman gets in by the exact same standards as men then good for her. But getting in because they made it easier isn’t equality, it’s cheating. 

There’s a woman in his team who’s tiny and she struggled to lift a piece of machinery used to cut the a/b/c pillars on a vehicle to remove the roof when extracting a person."
