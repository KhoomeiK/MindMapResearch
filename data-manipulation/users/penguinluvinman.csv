genetics,ffmycmi,t1_ffmtxvu,1580060179.0,">but does that means they have more varieties in other phenotypes like fur or odour

I would imagine, in general, they have basically the same set of phenotypes as we do, plus extras they can notice but we might not. There's just as much variation in height, weight, length, musculature, bone structure, facial features, fur color, eye color, ear size, etc. A lot of these are things humans can learn to distinguish in animals with experience, and we're probably not even aware we use them on each other. Like you can see a picture and say ""oh yea that's Tom Cruise"" and you can probably pick out a couple distinguishing characteristics for how you know, but we recognize all kinds of tiny details in face that were not really aware of and can't necessarily pick out or describe. 

In addition animals are much more sensitive to smells and pheromones (although to a degree, humans also use smell, but we're again less consciously aware of it) and sounds so they probably do have more phenotypic variety, or at least they can distinguish more between the phenotypes than humans can. They may be able to recognize a specific pitch of a voice or maybe an exact shade of a coat color that would be indistinguishable to us.

But for a lot of animals it's also less important to know individuals based on their social structures, but they can just recognize their family or their pack as a whole to prevent inbreeding.

Again, there's so much variety across the animal kingdom that the answer to all your questions is probably ""yes"" for at least one species out there, but not a general rule."
genetics,ffmpqom,t1_ffkmuza,1580057655.0,"I think you're trying to paint with too broad a brush. There's so much diversity in the animal kingdom there's not going to be one easy answer.

One example where many species can definitely recognize each other individually is mother-offspring relationships. Whales calves can recognize their mothers and [""whisper"" to them](https://sciencenordic.com/animals--plants-denmark-videnskabdk/hear-a-whale-calf-speak-to-its-mother/1445261). Dolphins have a signature whistle that others can recognize and remember, [even if they've been separated for years](https://www.npr.org/2013/08/07/209462717/dolphins-recognize-the-calls-of-long-lost-friends).

As a personal acedote, I used to do marine mammal rescues and we had an entangled manatee we were trying to capture. At one point we ended up accidentally capturing a calf that couldn't have been more than a month old. We didn't know if it belonged to our target animal or another one in the group. We held the baby in the water and it started calling, and only one of the adults approached (which was the entangled one) while the rest hung back so we figured it was the mother. One we finally captured it, we put the baby back in the water and it just kind of sat there. Then we put it in the pool with the one we thought was the mother and it perked up again and started calling and squirming around.   
We had no idea who her mom was, but she certainly knew.

I would imagine, although I can't say for sure, that many terrestrial animals can similarly recognize their offspring. It may be by sight, smell, sound, body language, or other factors, but they definitely have ways.

If you ever work with animals, you'll also start to be able to pick up one ways to identify individuals. If you just come across a bunch of sheep or wolves or chimps they might all look pretty much the same, save for a few major differences like color patterns. But if you work with the same group every day you'll notice subtle things, like this one has a little patch of distinctive gray hairs on her face or that one has a little triangle on his back right leg. So like the above poster said, each species is probably the best at recognizing their own"

NoStupidQuestions,fes9cdk,t1_fes4d9u,1579362828.0,"Dogs are not carnivores likes cats or their wolf ancestors.

Nature doesn't divide animals into discrete categories like humans tend to do. Some animals have more flexible digestive systems than others. Cats don't have the physiology to digest plant matter, so they are *obligate* carnivores. Wolves eat primarily meat, but are also known to occasionally eat berries and other non-meats when that's all that's available. They can probably survive without meat, but won't really thrive, so they are *facultative* carnivores. And deer have been known to [eat meat](https://slate.com/technology/2012/11/deer-eat-meat-herbivores-and-carnivores-are-not-so-clearly-divided.html) on some occasions, but you would be hard pressed to find any biologist that would classify them as omnivores. 

Domestic dogs have co-evolved with humans for long enough that we've sufficiently altered their physiology to consider them true omnivores. Domestic dogs have amplified genes for the enzyme amylase (30x the activity in wolves) and maltase that digests starch so they are much more capable of digesting plant material than their wolf ancestors. 

But again, it's more of a spectrum instead of a clear cut line of ""this animal is 100% carnivore, and that one is 100% omnivore""

Wolves eat primarily meat, but are also known to occasionally eat berries and other non-meats when that's all that's available. They can probably survive without meat, but won't really thrive, so they are *facultative* carnivores. And deer have been known to [eat meat](https://slate.com/technology/2012/11/deer-eat-meat-herbivores-and-carnivores-are-not-so-clearly-divided.html) on some occasions, but you would be hard pressed to find any biologist that would classify them as omnivores. 

Domestic dogs have co-evolved with humans for long enough that we've sufficiently altered their physiology to consider them true omnivores. Domestic dogs have amplified genes for the enzyme amylase (30x the activity in wolves) and maltase that digests starch so they are much more capable of digesting plant material than their wolf ancestors. 

But again, it's more of a spectrum instead of a clear cut line of ""this animal is 100% carnivore, and that one is 100% omnivore""

Ask_Politics,fen9zpl,t1_fen8ord,1579280195.0,"Impeachment is basically like an indictment for regular citizens. It's a formal bringing of charges, which says ""we [the state] believe we have enough evidence to prove that you are guilty of x, so now we're going to bring it to trial.""

The House thinks they have enough evidence against Trump, so they passed articles of impeachment which are now being sent to the Senate for a trial. At the end of the trial the Senate will vote to remove (verdict of guilty) or not.

Of course, unlike a regular trial, impeachment proceedings are largely a political process and less of a purely legal one."
