Are you kidding me?? I’m FROM Ireland and believe me, there’s no way in hell anyone from here *wants* to get married on Christmas Eve!! Hell, we had to attend a wedding on New Years Day just gone and all anybody was chatting about at the table was how inconvenient it was. (And also how cold we were but that 100% a standard Irish-Smalltalk topic.) 

Is your sister nuts?? 

1.) We don’t get snow...ever. Possibly a little bit of crappy, sludge-like dredges in February but that’s it. Think again if your looking for tons of fluffy white stuff.

2.) It’s EXPENSIVE! Like seriously, Christmas prices suck. Everything jumps up in the period between Dec-Jan...drinks, presents, taxis, venues, you name it it’s hiked. Did I also mention a glass of wine in a pub will set you back €10-18?? Per glass?? Yeah... enjoy that bar tab...

3.) Did I mention the weather? It’s shite. Bring an umbrella or wellies. Or even better,  wear both to the wedding, you’ll need them! There’s a reason we’re nicknamed the “Emerald Isle”.   It.Never.Stops.Raining. 

4.) Good luck on getting flights. Honestly....it’s tradition that millions of students/ex pats travel home for the holidays (sure you’d be excommunicated if ye didn’t.) so the flights will be hiked up higher than a hamsters ballsack in winter and there’s a high probability your luggage will end up in a much nicer (and warmer) destination that you will."

Tell your parents to train their dog better or invest in a better bin. You’re doing really well by not flushing the product. Either they will end up payin for a massive vets bill to have them surgically removed or they pay for a massive plumbers bill when the drains become blocked. Their choice.

Personally the training and bin’s cheaper..."
AmItheAsshole,ff1rpkg,t1_ff0gqyu,1579484695.0,I totally second this. OP did exactly the right thing for his pet. More people need to be compassionate when it comes to suffering animals and personally I think his other half is a TA for a.) involving religion and her beliefs and b.) wanting to prolong the poor cats painful decline because of those.

I work with animals an I wish more people had the compassion and common sense you had to end their companions suffering before it became unbearable. Animals become family members, loved ones and cherished friends....seeing them suffer in old age or illness is heartbreaking but I see so many people *prolonging* the pets agony due to “not wanting to say goodbye”. Which I hate because it’s utterly selfish. 

You did the right thing OP,  I sincerely admire the strength it took to make a decision like that but it shows just how much you cared for your animal. You didn’t want it to suffer or to be in pain. 


On a slightly harsher note....your significant other is TA. (Urgh...why is it when religion is involved everybody suffers??) You need to sit down with her and tell her that you don’t care if she thinks euthanasia is ‘immoral’, you did what was best for the animal and she’d better snap out of that childish sulk she’s in and grow up."
AmItheAsshole,ff1qhpj,t3_er3m1l,1579483932.0,"Honestly your ex sounds like a narcissistic arsehole with the willpower of a gnat. 

Blaming you or his own son for *him* eating all five bars of chocolate? (Seriously, who does that, like getting through one dairy milk alone makes me feel wretched and unhealthy.) 
It seems your ex has issues with restriction diets and then succumbing to binge eating. You need to set him clear rules and boundaries. Your son eats a balanced diet when he’s there and if your ex can’t control himself then fuck him, that’s something HE needs to get over. 
Stop making his sons life a misery just because of his bloody disorder and lack of willpower."
