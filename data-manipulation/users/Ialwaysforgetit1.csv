Responsible (equitable non-racist, non-sexist Capitalism with greed seriously morally and culturally condemned and taxed, in my time and experience in this country, born in 1949, is what will give people the most livable standard of living, quality of life, and incentive to develop wondrous solutions to tough problems. Before 1960, conspicuous consumption was really negatively viewed. The Soviet Union had nothing on its grocery store shelves but cabbages, borscht, and vodka. Human race needs the stimulus of making wealth and comfort and entertainment for its individuals. And Capitalism with all its immorality, is what supplies that.
