I know I would love to be able to experience it again, but for now it seems a little hard to think about. Thank you for your kind words and your love towards so many precious pups xx"

It seems simple and maybe even off topic, but the more I did for others the more it came back to me and how I felt about myself. Perhaps it’s about seeing results - I make an effort to do something or make someone else’s day better and see results in their gratitude. But sometimes you don’t see them too and that’s okay. It’s knowing you can make a positive impact, for me just knowing this much helps me love myself and gives me a sense of worth that personal affirmations might not always succeed in. Perhaps it’s a little left of field, but it never hurts to help those in need:)"
