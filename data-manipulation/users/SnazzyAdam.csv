Edit: The Sims 4 is still the worst iteration of this awesome series, but still that was funny"
PetTheDamnDog,ff1s0hw,t1_ff1ps16,1579484887.0,"Both are pretty good places to be! It's like you went to the pet store wanting only to look at the pugs but you got to see all the other little buddies too. Overall, still a win I'd say. :)"
PetTheDamnDog,ff0w25m,t1_ff0rx14,1579472802.0,"Nope, PA!"

PetTheDamnDog,fezvn79,t1_fezvaw9,1579462246.0,The only difference between hate and love is all the letters and their order and their definitions in the english language. They are very different things.

aww,fevz08r,t1_feu4355,1579403264.0,"I keep coming back to your post because it's so true. The ""just don't leave,"" I've been through 7 times in my nearly 30 years so far. Thank you."

Handwriting,fevjo1k,t1_fagreyk,1579398145.0,"Hey, I know this is super late to the game but I was going through my old posts, but I am exactly the same way. If I write something down, I remember it. I just think it's neat there are others like that!"
OldManDog,fevhls5,t1_feve7ip,1579397562.0,"Same, she loves a nickname :)"
aww,fev3u7h,t1_fev32ok,1579392808.0,That's the same thing I tell myself every morning.
aww,feum2gy,t1_feulaao,1579387835.0,And that comfort goes both ways. It puts my mind at ease knowing she's there or if I hear her snoring.
aww,feukbwe,t1_feujgm6,1579387311.0,I like to think they sense something. Especially when I'm working (I do a lot of phone work) and she's fast asleep near me but I run to the bathroom or the kitchen and there she is not 2 minutes later underfoot.
aww,feujkpi,t1_feuczne,1579387146.0,"Bece deaf! Yeah she would bolt as soon as she heard the tiniest crumb drop. Now she just bolts around when our other pug does, or if she smells dinner is ready lol"
aww,feujb0q,t1_feuh41m,1579387051.0,Will do!! Thank you for the smiles and kind words! Buffy sounds beautiful!
aww,feu14rx,t1_feu07oz,1579382112.0,"I still like to talk to her and say her name. And there's always this little part of me that says ""maybe she has selective hearing"" or ""maybe her hearing came back"" even though I know it's silly and dumb to think that way. But what harm does it do, ya know?"
aww,fetzu0x,t1_fettbir,1579381699.0,"Just using visual cues I think has helped the most, and appealing to her sense of smell. Her hearing went in the last year or so but she still runs into the kitchen 20 minutes before dinner because she smells the food cooking. We also close doors more often in case she decides to wander into a bedroom and fall asleep under a bed and we freak out looking for her. Our other pug (6 years old) keeps track of her while they in the yard to make sure she doesnt wander off too far and our bird will go nuts if he notices the dogs are out when we arent. If you have other animals, they seem to pick up some of the slack for each other. At least ours have."
