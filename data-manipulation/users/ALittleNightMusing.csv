awfuleverything,ffdgh50,t1_ffddlw1,1579820362.0,"It's because the BBC is a publicly-funded state service (although it's not technically owned or controlled by the government. It was established by a royal charter though so it is answerable to the government to show it's providing the correct sort of service to meet the obligations it was founded to meet). Since all TV in the UK was originally BBC, a TV licence was necessary to watch TV, because the license funds the BBC. Other channels came along but the system stayed the same: if you watch live TV you must have a licence. 

However, the government doesn't know whether you've just bought a TV or not! They basically just expect every household to have a TV so they send threatening letters to households who don't have a licence just in case they're cheating the system."

fatlogic,ffao2m9,t1_ff95ovh,1579740485.0,"Just keep plugging away at it and you'll get there - diet is much more important than exercise for losing weight, so just make sure you keep your calorie goals and your weight will go down. I found r/progresspics really inspirational: there are lots of people on there who have lost large amounts, too. Best of luck to you!"

AskReddit,ff8zlp5,t1_ff8iuzy,1579701012.0,"Me too! I rarely listen to albums and my 'favourite bands' are probably ones where I know three or four songs quite well. If I've found a song I love by an artist I don't feel the need to branch out and try more of their stuff, generally - I'm happy with what I've got. And yeah, all my playlists are emotion-based and are a clusterfuck of genres. No idea how to relate that to someone who has every Coldplay album or is a massive rap fan or whatever."
fatlogic,ff7fmvo,t1_ff72hs9,1579648442.0,"This is exactly where I'm at, thank you for explaining it so well! It's like now that I can have slightly more treat food without it being a problem, I just can't handle it and want to eat and eat and eat. I'm also going cold turkey for a reset. You've got this!"
