My girl cat used to bellow wrathfully at outdoor cats, but my younger cats are much more fearful.  I can imagine them acting a bit traumatized by a stranger. 

Any chance the outdoor cat marked somewhere where your cat can smell it?"

cats,ff0l3lw,t3_er2fyp,1579469846.0,"I had a pair of cats do this with no ill effect. The younger male would lick-bite-groom the older and smaller female. Their grooming sessions would generally turn into wrestling, but with no lasting harm. 

She is probably trying to establish dominance while the kitten is small. I wouldn’t worry too much unless someone really seems hurt."

cats,fejtjh0,t1_fejs4qx,1579185500.0,"Oh, that’s especially hard. I was one of the people who didn’t understand until I got my cats. After my first loss, I discovered that it doesn’t matter if you have a human-shaped hole in your heart or a cat-shaped hole in your heart, you still have a hole in your heart and it hurts. 

To be honest, I don’t think it’s possible to understand the possible depths of grief unless you have experienced some great loss yourself. Now I cry over other people’s cats.  

It’s perfectly reasonable to seek grief counseling just so you can talk to someone openly without regard for upsetting them. Counselors understand about grief in any shape. 

My most recent loss was in April 2018. She was my eldest cat, but only lived to 13. Caring for a cat for 23 years took a lot of work and love."

Interesting article. Also, interesting source of old magazine articles.

It theoretically works great as long as you do everything *exactly* right. You have to pinpoint the day of ovulation based on basal body temperature consistency of cervical mucous, etc.

In the US , the average age for women to marry is currently around 27 years, but women at that age are already past the best childbearing years. Thus, married couples will often have a harder time conceiving."

cats,fdvswyz,t3_emylhu,1578751167.0,"Looking at the video, I assumed it was a boy cat thinking of girl cats. If it’s a girl cat...maybe she’s thinking about kittens or missing a cat friend?"
cats,fds9v4v,t3_emyq33,1578697693.0,"I would not expect trouble between the older cat and kitten, other than the usual early squabbles. 

I would expect the kitten to want to go out if the other cat goes out. Ideally, I would try keeping both cats in and hope the elder adjusts to being indoors along with the move. Failing that,you might be able to control who goes in and out based on the layout of your house. Mine has a mudroom that serves as a catlock. 

My first cats *really* wanted to go out, and the survivor wound up taking supervised trips around the yard. She overlapped with a rescued stray who adapted to bring indoors-only and a young boy cat who *kind of* wanted out while the senior cat still went out but seemingly lost interest after she died."
cats,fdqp3pu,t1_fdpg3qd,1578671828.0,"All of mine had toys when they were younger but their interest wanes as they mature. I think they take in interest in whippy sticks because they are like rodent tails and stimulate the cat’s predator/prey instincts at a time when cute toys become less interesting. Like humans, cats can sustain their interest on novelty and imagination as kits  but when they’re adults they’re more jaded and have a harder time pretending things are really prey. 

I’m glad you were able to keep him."

cats,fdcu4uv,t3_eko9ok,1578284380.0,"Some people train their cats to sleep in one part of the bed—usually there seems to be a towel at the foot of the bed designated for the cat. With that said, my cats sleep on me. 

Cats don’t typically get separation anxiety over the course of one day. My cats usually sleep from around 11AM to 4PM, so my work absence  scarcely  registers. They tend to be fond of routines—get up, feed cat, go to work, come home... it makes things predictable for them. They do sometimes get anxious if left for days at a time. You should give thought in advance to how to look after a cat if you’re away for much more than 24 hours."

I have had  a lot of food being carried into a different room and eaten off the carpet. I think this is a result of the kittens’ personalities and intercat dynamics between these specific monsters, but I don’t know if I would try feeding multiple kits off the same plate again."
