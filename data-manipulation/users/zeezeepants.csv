SEO,ffal2vx,t3_esk99j,1579738442.0,"I think offering a discount is great, especially if it’s a non profit you care about. I’ve worked for two non profits in the past and they really don’t have big budgets or salaries so anything you can offer will help go a long way!"
latterdaysaints,ff3rioe,t1_ff3pm24,1579547293.0,"Remember, they’ve been reprimanded by angels and received witnesses in their own way that could’ve strengthened their testimonies immensely if on,y they humbled themselves. When Lehi received the vision of the Tree of Life, Nephi prayed and sought understanding for himself but Laman and Lemuel didn’t."
PCOS,fevft5a,t3_eqp3sa,1579396912.0,This is possible. I have no cysts but am diagnosed with PCOS.

TrueOffMyChest,fdrlehd,t3_emw5c2,1578686239.0,"I’m sorry for your loss. My only advice would be to be patient and don’t expect anything on how he should/might react. 

People process grief in different ways, one of them being a seemingly lack of grief. Some people grieve in silence, while others are more obvious. 

Also, grief might be delayed so if he seems fine now but down the road his behaviour has changed, give him time to process. 

Make sure you each have the proper support system in your lives to find healthy ways to cope and grieve with the loss and change."
television,fdf0ohl,t1_fdewytb,1578350661.0,Oh I love this show and watched it as soon as it was released on Netflix. I was just always confused why NBC was attached to the show when I didn’t even see promos on their network. It definitely is underrated and under promoted.
television,fdewrcg,t1_fdewkl8,1578348217.0,"Has it really? That’s surprising to me. I’m in Canada, watch and have cable, but have never seen even a promo for this show on TV. I’ll have to keep an eye out for this season on tv then."
television,fdewawo,t3_ekwp8r,1578347937.0,"Genuine question - I’ve only ever watched this on Netflix. As far as I’m aware, it has never aired on the actual NBC network. Is there a reason why not?"

BigBrother,fd5lqzu,t1_fd5i14v,1578178821.0,THIS. Cody had a HUGEEEE advantage of having a girlfriend on the outside pre-jury. She was able to rally those votes for him.
latterdaysaints,fd5jp6d,t3_ek3jxx,1578178335.0,"The woman can only be sealed for eternity to one man. For her to have a sealing undone (for lack of a better word), it has to go through the First Presidency, and from what I’ve been told it is very difficult to have this request approved. This is not an issue to be taken lightly. 

A woman and man CAN be sealed in the temple FOR TIME. Usually this happens for a  second marriage or something similar to that nature.

Also: not sure on the dynamics of your family relationships but if you are not a member this would be a great opportunity for you to ask and for them to help you learn more about the church and gospel!!"
productivity,fcz82zh,t3_ejnry6,1578095567.0,"Ok so you recognize that this is not advisable, and that’s for good reason. 

Is there a reason you need to do this? Do you have an actual deadline to complete some goals or are these just self imposed? Running on just 4 hours of sleep a night will actually affect your productivity for the worse. Your results will suffer and so will your health. It’s honestly not worth it. 

There are ways certain people “survive” on 4 hours or less of sleep a night but they are illegal or just stupid. The long term effects at not worth the short term gains."

Costco,fcoul6c,t3_eghzuc,1577841979.0,Thanks everyone! I feel more confident buying a ring from them now. I know their return policy can’t be beat but the ring will need to be resized (and therefore unreturnable) so I wasn’t sure about quality of their diamonds. Looking forward to getting a good deal from them. Thanks!

Frugal,fcoieyg,t3_ei9zto,1577832986.0,"PAY YOURSELF FIRST. I cannot stress this enough! Even if you can only set aside a dollar or two, it’s worth it. Set it aside in a separate account and don’t ever touch it unless you sincerely need it for an emergency. 

Also create a budget so you’re aware of how much you spend each month and where the money is going. Be realistic and figure out how much you need to bring in to meet or exceed your budget. 

Paying yourself first, setting aside for expenses and debt, then anything fun or unnecessary is a good order for how you should spend your money. 

Lastly, say for example you earn $500 in a month. This should not mean you have $500 to spend. So don’t spend or waste what you earn!!"
Edmonton,fcj6s60,t3_ehgr6x,1577678679.0,"I love Telus. Sometimes they overcharge but it’s rare. If it happens, just give a quick call and ask to speak to their loyalty department. They’ll correct the issue AND give you a credit if you’re nice. 

From what I hear, Shaw doesn’t really care and doesn’t have a loyalty department."
