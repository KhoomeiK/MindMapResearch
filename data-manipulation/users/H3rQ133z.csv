So my dumbass said a specific basketball game we had when we beat that team in the 4th qtr (because it happened like last season), then everyone else goes on to say their fucking hobbies.

AskReddit,fdl7kyo,t3_elssvy,1578518401.0,"Bro this was like senior year of hs for me, but a teacher asked whats your favorite pastime outloud to go around the class. I was very first based off where I was sitting in the room and for some reason I interpreted this as like whats my favorite memory rather than what hobbies do I have. So my dumbass said a specific basketball game we had when we beat that team in the 4th qtr (because it happened like last season), then everyone else goes on to say their fucking hobbies. If the teacher would have just worded it like, what do you like to do to pass the time? I would have answered with hobbies, but that was the first time it was worded to me like that and I thought she meant whats my favorite memory lol."

nba,fdaeyzo,t3_ejo8i9,1578245309.0,I'd be okay with like 90k a year to root for the Lakers. Its a decent pay increase and I feel like since shit is more expensive in LA as opposed to OKC it probably balances out for all the alcohol ill be purchasing at Staples center.

AskReddit,fcmt9ax,t1_fcmlw39,1577791163.0,I feel like the best comedians are those who are just good ass story tellers. Telling a story with those few well delivered jokes in between are great because of the build up to how we got to that point in the story. A really good piece I can think of is Jim Jefferies talking about his two friends he had growing up and one of the brothers being disabled in a wheel chair and they take him to a brothel.
