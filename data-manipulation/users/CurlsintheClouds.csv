politics,ffdml2s,t1_ffcvsvy,1579824087.0,"Of course I have. Grew up in a Christian home. Where does it say it's okay for a man to list after his daughter? I know the stories, but it never said it's okay, right? It was just the story that was recorded."
offmychest,ffckxf1,t1_ffcjyo0,1579801651.0,"Exactly. My daughter is nearly 16 and often carted when she's with me and I'm buying alcohol. I look younger than my age, so people often assume we're sisters or friends. 

The idea of a grown-ass man making moves on her...taking advantage of her relative innocence and immaturity...makes me want to puke."

Gross."

TrueOffMyChest,ffcfduw,t3_eshpm5,1579798273.0,"So, you are right. And here's my personal story.

7th grade. I started receiving these letters from a ""secret admirer."" In the handwritten notes were backhanded compliments like ""I love the gap between your teeth"" (never self conscious about it until I read that line) or ""I love the holes in your head"" (chicken pox scars I WAS self conscious about) or ""I love your frizzy hair"" (curls I didn't know how to handle yet).

Fast forward to a Friday night. Spending the night at my best friend's house. While she was getting a shower, I was looking through stuff under her bed. I can't recall what I was looking for, but she knew I was doing it.

I found the letters. Only they were different. Written in my best friend's handwriting.

Once out of the shower, she admitted to having written them. Then she had her younger brother copy them so they looked like a guy had given them to me.

Devastated, crying, I called my mom to pick me up.

Needless to say, we were no longer besties."
exchristian,ffcaffb,t1_ffc5pl7,1579795184.0,That is terrifying.
unpopularopinion,ffca6lz,t1_ffbwsqy,1579795032.0,What's jumping to 25?
unpopularopinion,ffca5hh,t3_essq09,1579795012.0,Not sure this is an unpopular opinion. I have thought all of this since I was 18 and wishing I had all the privileges of a 21 year old.
SimsMobile,ffc3fm2,t3_estpo9,1579790580.0,Agreed.
TheOA,ffc2i2o,t1_ffc2f6i,1579789903.0,"Yes, yes, yes! I knew I wasn't alone in this!"
AmItheAsshole,ffbtuly,t3_esle02,1579782534.0,"NTA - names are a funny thing. I believe (as a woman) that it's important to change your last name when you get married. Because when you get married, you accept your husband as your new family. He, and the family you create, become your priority. As much as one may love the family they were born into, I think it's important to a marriage to make that shift. Because as painful as it may sound, the new family should come before your old one.

That said, I have nothing against women who believe differently. I don't think it is an asshole move to change your name back at all. I wouldn't have done it, but I think it's beautiful that you want to share your name with your family, the family that helped you through such a difficult time.

I am sorry for your loss. I can't imagine. Married 10 years, and I'm pretty sure if he were to pass, it would tear me in half. You are so strong, and perhaps, changing your name back will give you more strength to move on. <3"
