When I pointed out that I always indicated my intentions with binds, ults ready and group up for each ult, he would always ult just before I hit 90% when I first press my ult status button.  I was closely watching his ult status the entire match, but he raged at me when I suggested he do the same.  If people didn't harass me for my female voice than maybe I'd talk more.  It's not enjoyable to try to help a team in voice and to be harassed for it, so I avoid it a lot, except in comp. No one should expect other's to do the work for you.

Seattle,ffqw9dz,t1_ffpwdzr,1580145071.0,"I understand this, especially since both my kids have gone through the process. I was merely pointing out that testing is available to all, so they can understand where their child is academically. Then they can then submit a referral ."
Seattle,ffqw39e,t1_ffnk028,1580144961.0,"The MAP was not phased out. My son has taken it every school year, including this year. He was automatically placed in Advanced Learning, but to apply for the HCC schools you need to apply and take the Cogat.

No one nominated my daughter, who was the top 99 percentile in all areas.  Parents are told when MAP testing will occur and are given results, these days through The Source. All the information for any parent who knows their child is advanced in on the school's web site. I'm sorry you were not nominated, but that usually is due to the parents efforts.

I am sure there are many factors as to why minority families do not pursue this for their kids. Lack of knowledge shouldn't be the main issue since there is just as much information available to them as to any other family.  I believe a lot of if is far more about personal choice and we should find out why that is."

Every family should get a form to apply.  Teachers can also nominate.  We missed 1st grade because we didn't know about the program then either and even though she was identified we barely missed the deadline.  You have to apply at a time of year no one is thinking of the next school year.  Even if they just sent home forms and notices to all families I think it would help a lot.  I honestly think it's more than that though.  The program is over crowded.  Even if they had more minorities there wouldn't be space for them.

ZeroWaste,fe6ftr8,t1_fdplbux,1578889612.0,"Yes the pay is fair for an entry level position.  There are many opportunities for advancement, but you're kind of out of luck if you just want to stay as a warehouse worker.  They don't give out raises unless it's a company wide raise.   I've gone through many mangers and how good of a job it is depends a lot on the managers.  Unfortunately  they are very focused on numbers.  They, as a company, don't seem to value what I would compare to preventive medicine.  It's all about the work being done. It doesn't matter that it's done wrong.  It doesn't matter how much is thrown away because it wasn't received correctly.  The training is bad and therefore unless you ask a lot of questions and figure things out, you'll probably be doing the job wrong.  The worst part for me is seeing the waste and not being allowed to take time to fix issues.  The job itself isn't bad as long as you understand it's a warehouse job and it's going to be physically.  The times they expect you to reach are super easy to obtain, but again if you don't know how you're supposed to tracking your time correctly you might not be making your rate, even if you actually are.  Ofc my warehouse is small and it's not run the same way the larger warehouse are run so I can't really speak to those workers."

I also get flares from gluten, but not everyone does, so maybe the gluten in the beer won't affect you.  Have you drank beer before and been fine?  If it's a part of something you'd like to continue doing, hanging out and having a beer, than it might be worth it to risk another flare up to see if it was the beer.   Just drink one brand the next time you go out and see if it's safe.  If so you can then try others.  Be sure to keep avoiding high sulfate ciders and wine."

todayilearned,fe2i8f9,t1_fe0clvi,1578838614.0,"Do you have anything to back that assertion up?  Because that is totally inaccurate.  Do you know how child development works? Do you have knowledge on brain development?  

It's common for gifted children to have asynchronous development.  Because they have areas of advanced development in some areas, other areas will fall behind, such as motor skills or social development.  

My child started therapy at 4 years old to develop her social skills.  She didn't need that because she was treated special.  These kid's don't start out as easy babies and a blank slate.  Their asynchronous development starts on day one.  

At a mom's group when she was 4 months old.  The facilitator talked to me after the 3rd meeting.  She told me my daughter took the world in differently.  She looked around more.  She was more aware  This is why they often have difficulty navigating social situations.  They take in so much information at one time that they get overwhelmed.  She prepared me to be aware of how her brain will work for and against her.  She was 100% correct.  

Telling people who are struggling with a child who is advanced academically but developmentally  behind socially that they created a narcissist is incredibly insulting.  It's your opinion based on your ignorance.  There is just way too much information about why gifted kid's struggle socially for anyone to be able to make  that case."

If you try this please test a small area.  I'd hate to recommend something that might irritate your skin.  It's called Porcelain No 1 solution Skin whitening serum.

IdiotsInCars,fcoduxy,t3_ehy589,1577829832.0,"That's the Book version of what we saw last night.  We got stuck behind a lady for so long who was driving on a 4 lane highway, 2 each way, in the left lane.  There was heavy traffic.  She was going the same speed as a truck with it's hazards on in the right lane.   It took forever, but finally we got around her.  She was doing this exactly with her phone. Holding it to the steering wheel and eyes glued."
ZeroWaste,fcoczla,t1_fcn5pfy,1577829218.0,Maybe they were doing that?  But they didn't mention that.  They only mentioned it when their toilet flooded the apartment and the pipes were clogged with grease.

ZeroWaste,fcmgedn,t1_fcktdm5,1577774272.0,This is based on my cities guide lines.  They recommend any container from a glass jar to a milk carton or for large amounts of oil and plastic jug to be recycled. If you let it cool slightly you don't have to use glass.  We hardly cook meat and don't fry foods so we produce very little. Trust me the city would much rather have a jar of grease thrown into the trash than having it poured down the drain.
ZeroWaste,fcmfu27,t1_fcl4cld,1577773682.0,Oh.  Please don't tell me this is your standard practice.  The utrap will not stop all of it and can cause issues further down the line.  And in my mom's case it caused backups in her townhouses and she needed costly septic system repairs.  It can cause issues all they way down the line to the treatment plant.  And why would you want to even have to do that???  Just don't pour it down the sink in the first place and save yourself the chore.

IdiotsInCars,fcj9tki,t1_fciq2uf,1577680858.0,"They are not the fault, but there are things they could have done.  I mean, there's always a point where, yeah you had the right of way, but that doesn't mean things might have gone differently and with a whole lot less hassle, had you thought ahead and reduced your risk.  I mean, if I hit someone dressed in all black in the dark crossing the street on my left in my blind spot, the pedestrian can get compensated because I'm at fault, but they might have been safer wearing reflective arm bands and not assuming a car would stop and could have helped to  avoid something like that happening.   I guess I'm always looking for ways to avoid situations and to me, imo, cam car contributed.  If it's raining and you can't stop in 5 seconds, go slower.  Turn on your headlights.  Look far ahead.  Simple really.  Anyone or anything can cross our paths at anytime.  That's why they call it defensive driving."

This feeling just hit me in the last year and I'm too old for more kids now.  Maybe I'm just missing having young kids around and I am forgetting the hard parts.  So, I've got another 10 to 20 years or so to wait for a grandbaby, if they choose to have kids.  Though I'm not sure the world is going to be a good place to live in a few decades down the road."
