politics,ffcn8sx,t1_ffcn31i,1579803055.0,"Nope.

Just a lot of hand waving and ""nuh uh's"" which is more than enough for their base."
AmItheAsshole,ff9vh3q,t1_ff9kp1z,1579722381.0,">I will say that most of the strange comments come from women.

Absolutely. Every time.

I'm assuming they're projecting their poor choice in partner/spouse on you in a passive aggressive way."

It sounds like you addressed your issues (congrats on 9 mo). Now it sounds like your wife could stand to do some self healing in therapy."

Just a misunderstanding.

edit: Not sure I understand the downvotes. The sister may have poor social skills and misread the room at the time but that hardly makes her an asshole for being upset when she (wrongly) thought she had a dress lined up."

insanepeoplefacebook,fezfxet,t1_feyz3t3,1579456901.0,Exact same thing with AOC. They’re afraid af of women telling them how it is.
facepalm,fezebdr,t1_fex86ps,1579456484.0,And they just would’ve brought up how your white male privilege got you the gig and how nothing you do was earned or matters because anti-minority and anti-women Hollywood paved the golden way for you. No matter what you say you’re still a piece of shit in their eyes.

MurderedByWords,fek2pqd,t1_fek0vih,1579191349.0,">Most right wing people can see reason and exposing them to a different way of thinking is the best way to attempt to steer them away from their ideology.

By all means head over to r/Conservative and start changing minds. Let us know how that works out for you."

OP, would you have celebrated the same way if you learned your bully moved away and would in all likelihood never see him again?

I feel like everybody here is getting caught up in the fact this dude died, but if OP would've behaved the same way if the bully simply moved away then I don't see why he's TA in this case. He's just be celebrating the fact that he doesn't have to put up with that shit anymore."
cordcutters,fe90nr1,t1_fe3jwzd,1578932895.0,"Pretty sure they axed that earlier last year. Now the ""chat"" option just takes you to a bot that gives you some troubleshooting tips and then prompts you to call customer service if you don't find what you're looking for.

I'm guessing the live chat was helping too many customers in a more efficient and convenient way so they had to kill it."

cordcutters,fdnepbl,t1_fdnddwj,1578584216.0,ESPN+ doesn't have individual profiles but it doesn't seem to have a 'Continue Watching' section either so you wouldn't really have to worry about something like that getting cluttered up with multiple users' viewing histories. It also is very hit or miss when it comes to saving my progress on things I haven't finished watching. While I really enjoy the content on there it's not the most competent service.
