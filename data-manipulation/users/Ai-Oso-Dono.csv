malaysia,fepu3zl,t1_fepl94d,1579331347.0,Lol okay. You posed earlier that other cultures celebrating their festivals was ‘enroaching’ upon Muslim traditions. Saying that other cultures celebrating themselves hurts your idea of a ‘Muslim’ Malaysia is racist.
malaysia,fepky18,t1_fepkdye,1579323215.0,"Stop plugging your fingers in your ears and screaming “Muh state religion!”. It’s a multiracial, multi religious country. People like you are holding us back. Negara bangkit bersama, no one needs your racist bullshit hidden under weak pretentiousness of religion. What you believe is your right, don’t deny other people theirs. If your faith is so weak that simply seeing other people celebrate theirs, you’ve got the moral strength of a twig."
