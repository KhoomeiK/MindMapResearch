The spammy ones are usually pretty terrible at the game, so if you upset their rhythm once you can probably get a stock off them"

Wouldn't want to invite kids into looking into the series at 6-7 years old. As for MC, i can say that i almost bought an xbox for reach and probably will for the next halo. It's an exclusive goldmine for them because of people like me, i couldn't imagine it happening"
