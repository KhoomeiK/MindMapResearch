introvert,fdgkjev,t3_el1h7a,1578400394.0,"A long 10 min hug.. that takes away all your mental pain..  
A kind off hug that i won't judge you for you being you.. 
A kind of hug that breaks all.the barriers you have built out of anxiety, social insecurity, pain and touches deep down your inner soul and rescues you..
A kind of hug that really means and says that it's ok to cry, it's ok to make mistakes, it's ok to be imperfect.. 
A kind of hug that says, i know you are good person deep down..

It's like a magic bean or magic potion that relieves you and liberate you from all kind of stuff.. it's like an LSD..

Yeah.. that's the kind of hug I am craving for.."

socialanxiety,fc0engf,t3_effh9s,1577288797.0,"Sadly.. it's hard to get free from real world expectations.. it becomes harder when you are adult, alone, doing your assignments/job away from home/family in another country where no one understands what you speak (English. I am in Germany), and during vacation..

And it becomes even harder when you see your friend suffering in a hospital, where no one understands what you speak or what they speak, and nurses yells at you. (Of course their(nursesfrustration is obvious and understandable. They are doing their jobs during festivals, when they are supposed to be with family. They are hero's, no doubt)..  

It is fucki* hard to act normal.. so fu* hard.."
