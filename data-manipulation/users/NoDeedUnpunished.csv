Having said that, however, I still got inspiration from much of what she has written. Even though I wanna believe what she says, how do we REALLY know any of this works and that we are not going down an endless goose chase of things to try? I always have my eye out for a con.

Speaking of trying endless things... My big symptom right now is lack of mental energy. I'm getting little shots of it here and there, but something is missing. My sense is that there is a supplement that is kicking in periodically and if I up the dose, it will finally kick in. Tomorrow I'm trying 400gm of SAM-e from my normal 200gm. Wish me luck."

For me, depression and anxiety has always been there, so there's no smoking gun to look for. There's most likely a heavy genetic component and I also suspect gut problems.

With respect to 5htp and how quickly it works. I've read in the book The Mood Cure that it works within 10-15 minutes, which almost made me chuckle. A shot of scotch barely works that fast, let alone some that needs to be digested. So, I discounted that info. Any idea how long it takes for 5HTP to travel from mouth to brain and start working?"

ResearchingDepression,feozxi1,t1_feooy35,1579309045.0,"Which ones help the most so far? That's a tough one for a couple of reasons. One is because I started taking supplements in groups, so I wouldn't be able to single any one out. The other reason is that they work slower and more subtle than drugs. The best way to test supps imo is to take them for a couple of weeks and then quit them. I find that quitting a supp tells you more about what it does than starting it.  With that in mind I think that 5HTP and tyrosine help quite a bit. But, really I can't answer that question.

I will say that I am MUCH better than I was two, three or four years ago. I attribute that to supplements. 

I've seen the 90% of SE is created in the gut, but I've also read that the SE that is made in the gut DOES NOT cross the blood brain barrier. However, I also wonder if symptoms of depression don't originate in the body. For me, I feel depression and anxiety in my body as much as in my head. I get a sinking feeling in my heart, a soreness in my stomach, an electric buzz in my arms or a flash in my back. Does the SE created in my gut go to help alleviate those symptoms?

My inflammation markers in the OAT were low, so I haven't investigated that.

I think that the gut is key. After taking on the candida fight, I've noticed a bunch of differences... or progress. The anti-candida protocol gave me some physical and mental symptoms, which have been all over the place. One minute I'm good. One minute I'm feeling depressed. Over the last two weeks, my gut has been super noisy, there has been massive die-off in my stool and I've been less stressed.

Candida,feimrt7,t1_fei66go,1579142176.0,"I took my OAT back in August and subsequently bought Biocidin and took it for a couple of months. it didn't do a thing. Then I stumbled across a post that talked about a four step protocol to fight candida. The four steps were :

1. detach the biofilm. 2. Target candida microbes. 3. Cleanup. 4. Probiotics.

At this point I got serious and upped all my doses and that's when I started to feel something. A day after this new enhanced protocol I began to feel mild flu symptoms. I tested to see if the new symptoms were indeed linked to the new protocol by stopping it for a few days and rebooting. sure enough the second time around the symptoms returned.

Today, for the first time I noticed massive die-off in my stool. Unmistakable. Just like the pictures.

By the way, I never had any outward signs of candida. No thrush. No rashes. No toe fungus. No anything. Just depression and anxiety."

Candida,feh52xx,t1_feg6xe1,1579109313.0,"I've been searching for answers pretty hard core for about a year. It all started with a massive panic attack that lasted for about a month. At that time I quit eating sugar, coffee and eating less carbs.  It took a while but things started to get better. I also started taking supplements like tyrosine, phenalalanine, 5HTP, tryptophan, B6, C, etc. I would have to say it helped bring me from wanting to jump off a bridge to wanting to sleep a lot.

At the time I spent hundreds of hours online searching for answers and the holistic people made the most sense to me. I found Dr Walsh's work about the 5 bio-types for mental disorders and did that testing. I also took an Organic Acids Test. From those I found out I was short low in Zinc, VC and under-methylated. From the Organic Acids Test it showed that I had Candida, which I didn't even suspect.

I never showed any outward signs of candida such as thrush, rashes, acne or anything like that, but I have suffered from depression and anxiety for as long as I've been alive. The big question I have is can someone suffer from candida without showing outward signs?

I've been fighting candida for about a month and at times I get confused about symptoms. I started taking things to dissolve bio-films, target microbes and replace gut-biom. At first I got mild flu-like symptoms, but that went away. Right now I'm just in the trenches hopefull killing off the candida. From this forum I've read that it can take a few months and to just stick with it."

What are your symptoms?"
Candida,fe5wenp,t3_enw9pp,1578876449.0,"Hi! I'm no expert as I came here recently for advice and support, but I do have some experience. 

1. I hear people take from 2 months to 2 years to kick it. 
2. That diet sounds much harder that it is. The withdrawal from caffeine, sugar and carbs only lasts for a few day to a week at most. Quitting caffeine only slowed me down for about three days. I can also say that your taste buds change. I was a sugar freak and now the thought of a ton of sugar kinda turns my stomach. After a while with no sugar, something like a carrot or a banana tastes super super sweet. I couldn't take a sip of a coke or pepsi. To me it tastes like pancake syrup. The hard part for me was the bread, but over time you don't miss it anymore.

Don't beat yourself up over dietary changes. I've seen some Dr.s suggest ramping the ""bad foods"" down over time. Personally, I would rather go through a few days of hell knowing there is a light at the end of the tunnel, if I knew it was going to speed up my overall progress.

My info comes from Dr. Walsh, and he claims that folate made the majority of his undermethylated/depressed patients worse. 

I get what you're saying about SERT homeostasis though. For Walsh to be correct SERTs would have to be low and then, folate would have to boost SERTs, which would at some point level off.  Hmmm."
MTHFR,fc77lix,t3_e4wvir,1577499668.0," From what I understand, aside from methylation, folate is used to make SERTs (Serotonin ReUptake Transporters), which as the name implies mops up serotonin after being discharged in the synapses. If you have a depression problem, there is a good chance that you already have a low amount of serotonin in your synapses for whatever reason. Taking something that will further enhance your ability to create an even greater shortage isn't going to end well.   


What I don't quite understand is, OK then what?   
  As far us neurotransmitter action, the folate cycle is involved in creating tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tryrosine, which are used for serotonin and dopamine production.   
  So, is the answer to supplement with methionine and SAMe for methylation and then tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tryrosine for NT production?"
