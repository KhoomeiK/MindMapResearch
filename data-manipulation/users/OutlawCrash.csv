AssassinsCreedOdyssey,ffqctlc,t1_ffq3jkn,1580130620.0,May have been poison. My poison build is my go-to for taking down vastly higher level enemies cuz it lowers their damage output.

d100,ffjlk17,t3_etrdf6,1580001030.0,"Combat:

Goblins gathered around a fire and roasting some... questionable meat

A dragon with a toothache (or other injury if comedy encounters aren’t your thing)

5 chests, 1d4 of which are mimics

Trap: 

Classic tripwire

Stepping stones with letters/runes on them that have to connect and spell the correct word to grant passage (all the rest are switches for arrow traps or something similar)

Puzzle: 

Maze (use DM fog if playing with a board or draw out the maze and reveal it slowly if playing theater of the mind)

Empty room with a cipher to unlock the exit door

General Encounters:

A room set 1 story lower than the rest, filled with water. Players have to swim down through a second door and climb a ladder to get out

A room with nothing but a single gold piece in the middle of the room

The abandoned den of some sort of evil pet (sorta like the rancor pit from star wars), the bones of which can be found in the corner, surrounded by humanoid skeletons. 


Hope this helps!!"

Obviously it does sound similar to those titles (because they were the inspiration) but as the saying goes, there’s no such thing as a new idea. Most ideas will sound similar (in some way or another) to something that already exists."

YouShouldKnow,fdnlt16,t1_fdn9w9m,1578588476.0,Pretty much. Alcohols can have similar effects when you breathe them in as when you drink them.
YouShouldKnow,fdm4s8z,t1_fdm4bma,1578539787.0,"That’s determined by the other stuff in the markers. Theyre both based around the same organic solvents, (either alcohols or benzene-derivatives) but the other stuff changes the way the ink behaves after the solvents have evaporated off and the ink has dried."
YouShouldKnow,fdm25sk,t3_em0dp2,1578538019.0,"The scientific explanation is that the dry erase marker contains alcohol, which acts as a solvent and dissolves the permanent ink. The alcohol base is also the reason that dry erase ink dries so fast, since alcohols tend to evaporate much faster than water."
