Even if you don't mean, ""absolutely believe every woman, every time,"" that's what you've made it sound like. And yeah, women can do huge social damage to men through rape accusations. I do think it's rare, and that it's a lot more common for men to get away with shit, but yeah, it does happen.

What strikes me as odd is that this fifteen-year-old girl not only feels no remorse, but is actively taunting the family. And sure, psychopaths exist, but *everyone* is on her side? This girl has never exhibited this behavior with anyone before? I actually am aware of a case, a classmate of a friend whose girlfriend lied about being pregnant so he wouldn't leave for school. He lost an important scholarship, which ruined his chances at college, and he killed himself over it. Not only did she have to live with the guilt, she became a social pariah. Even if this girl had a perfect record before, it's rare that women don't face backlash for rape accusations, even when they're telling the truth; this is one reason why underreporting is such an issue.

There are other elements here that do strike me as cliche, but that was my major one. I'm not saying it *couldn't* have happened. There could be some exaggeration as well. But it reads to me like it was written to make a point."
unpopularopinion,fgqbktk,t3_ezr8r7,1581021288.0,"What needs to stop is this kind of blaming that offers no understanding or solutions. We live in a deterministic universe. Everything happens for a reason, or it's random. This kind of attitude is illogical in either case; the self cannot be self-determining, because that's circular. We still have free will, because the things that make us who we are are us; we're not controlled by the universe, we're little pieces of it. However, the fact remains that if you had that person's genes and had lived their life, you would be exactly the same as them.

I mean, no one *wants* to be 500 pounds (and if they do, that's its own issue). When that happens, *something* is very wrong, genes or otherwise. It often is genetic. And that's not limited to genetic predisposition to gain weight; it also has a lot to do with brain chemistry. In other words, that kind of extreme over-eating is a mental disorder. What kinds of genetics predispose someone to it, and what kind of environments facilitate it? Those are the questions we should be asking. Part of it has to do with the fact that it's a downward spiral. That is, the more weight you gain, the harder it is to lose it, both because of physical and motivational factors. Not only does it become harder to move around, it becomes harder to believe you could really be any different. The latter is something pretty much everyone can relate to, if they're being honest. We all have things we don't like about ourselves -- unhealthy habits, procrastination -- that are hard to change in part because they are part of our self-definition. Beliefs are subconscious; we can't change them through force of will. What's more, they're reinforced by our lived experience. If you believe you can't change, if you've always failed when you've tried, what do you think happens? Although shaming has helped some people lose weight, in general, it makes the problem worse, because it frames obesity as a problem with who you are (unchangable) rather than as a behavioral problem that can be addressed (changable). The kind of emotions it creates are also detrimental to motivation and encouage comfort-seeking behaviors, including over-eating. 

A lot of social factors have created the obesity epidemic, too. Most of us have a pretty sedentary life-style, and we know for a fact that unhealthy foods are addictive. If it weren't enough that we're biologically programmed to crave fat and sugar, corporations have interests to keep us coming back for more.

Finally, it's illogical to act as though obese people are a drain on society. What do you think society *is*? Not just obese people, sure, but they're part of it. People have value because we assign value to ourselves and others; obese people think and feel, and have others who care about them. We disparage inconveniencing others because we value humans in the first place. Therefore, it makes no sense to say that some people aren't worthwhile because they're a drain on ""society."" Instead of dehumanizing them, we should be trying to identify the factors that go into why they are the way they are and addressing them."
BrandNewSentence,fgq7tvw,t1_fgp8ln3,1581019480.0,">for the longest time i’ve been afraid of the “unmedicated me” or the “real me” because that person is such a jerk and is so unlikable.

I think I can help you with that, at least: there is no ""real you."" That's what some post-modernists say, anyway, that the self is fragmented, and so doesn't exist. I actually disagree, though; the way I think of it, the self is fluid. Like, water changes shape and form, but it's all still water. Likewise, you feel, think, and behave differently in different contexts, but it's all still you. So to phrase it, there is no *one* ""real you."" You on medication is just as real as you off of medication. I also think the choice to take medication represents intentional change, as much as deciding to regulate your behavior (which, when you've got a psychological disorder, is often unreliable at best).

Your brain chemistry got fucked up because of genes and environment; you didn't decide that, and they're no less an outside influence than medication. Everything is cause and effect -- genes, environment, medication, they all constitute ""self."" We still have free will, because those things *are* us. In other words, we're not controlled by the universe, we're little pieces of it. Even so, that without cause is random, so... In other words, although it may be socially detrimental, acting ""jerky"" does not make you bad in the first place."

I think so, at least to some extent. Like, he knew something about her step-dad. I do think Bojack is terrible at considering other people's needs. And yeah, it comes from being priviledged to a certain extent; other people come to him and do things for him, so he never had to learn. It gets tricky for me, because, coming from a deterministic point of view, things like ""personal responsibility"" and ""deserving"" kind of fall apart when I start discussing them in logical terms.

unpopularopinion,fgn8f6z,t1_fgmy5px,1580939644.0,"Yeah, a lot of these issues aren't limited to young men. Society just doesn't give a shit about you if you don't have money. I will say that men are stuck in more restrictive gender roles, shamed for displaying any emotion other than anger, and generally are more harshly criticized when they can't find a job or a partner. But this is a hot topic in Feminist discourse; ""toxic masculinity"" and ""patriarcy"" aren't men oppressing women, but a set of hyper-masculine values that our society runs on -- competition, domination, aggression -- that hurt everyone involved."
unpopularopinion,fgn7tdx,t3_ez9yt7,1580939320.0,"This actually is an issue talked about in Feminist circles. I would know -- I went to a women's college, and am still in the humanities. I also engage with a lot of more casual Feminist media, Youtube, that kind of thing.

Let me make one thing clear: while I do have an issue with some aspects of the ""girl power"" movement, the patriarchy and toxic masculinity do not refer to men or masculinity itself. There are plenty of masculine traits that are healthy -- assertiveness, confidence, courage -- all those are traditionally masculine values. No, the patriarcy refers to a society that prioritizes masculine values like competition, domination, and aggression at the expense of people's well being. It enforces strict gender roles, saying that any weakness or ""weak"" emotion like sadness is unacceptable for men. Toxic masculinity is a kind of hyper-masculinity that allows no room for the feminine and stresses domination through force above all else. The predefined social mold for men? That's literally what toxic masculinity is. Here's a whole video about where the term comes from and how it's used now:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E\_O7w5W7rZg&t=315s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_O7w5W7rZg&t=315s)

And yeah, we do talk about the affect it has on men, how it makes them less likely to seek help for depression and anxiety, less likely to report rape and assault, and more likely to commit suicide or die of stress-related issues. Toxic masculinity also has to do with economic injustice, competition and capital over all else, including human well-being, this idea that if you're homeless, it's your fault because you just couldn't compete. These ideas certainly aren't limited to men, and in fact, can be used against men by women. If women expect men to do everything for them, support them both emotionally and fiscally, that's what I'd call toxic femininity. This is one reason it's good for women to be independent.

I'll admit that some aspects of Feminism, especially pop Feminism, have some unhealthy attitudes toward men. But not all. Contrapoints, for example, talks about how society tells men what not to be, but has failed to provide a healthy model of masculinity. I can see that. She argues that Feminists are a scape-goat of sorts -- that it's not really women and Feminists that are the problem, but a society where the wealthiest beat down and use everyone else for their own gain. These people are largely men, but those they abuse are women *and* men. When it comes to things like economic justice... Well, I wouldn't say it's solely a Feminist issue, but, from experience, I can say that someone who is Feminist is also more likely to be supportive of that and other things like it in general. I definitely am. Shit, how could I not be? My father and I lost my childhood home when I was 26, were definitely food insecure. I was contributing to the income through working as a server, and my dad had social security (he was 57 when I was born) but living in hotels like we were was expensive as fuck! It was impossible to save up for anything! I felt like no one cared, like we were society's refuse. Because let me tell you something, it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman, young or old: you are worthless to American society if you don't have money. Before all this, my dad had a hell of a time getting my mother on disability before she died (she was mentally ill and couldn't do it herself), and the bureaucracy made it hard to get food stamps... We didn't have them long, though, because I hit the income limit. Which, of course, actually made it harder for us to eat. I'm still bitter about it, when I think about it."

Of course -- assertiveness, protectiveness, confidence, courage; I could go on, but I think you get my point. When Feminists talk about ""the patriarchy"" and ""toxic masculinity,"" they're not talking about men themselves, or even all traditionally masculine values, but the fact that our society places so much emphasis on aggression, domination, and strict gender roles. Here's a whole video about the history and modern usage of the latter term:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E\_O7w5W7rZg&t=315s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_O7w5W7rZg&t=315s) 

How all of this affects men is one of the central issues discussed; if you're looking for people advocating for less strict gender roles for men, you'll find plenty within Feminist circles.

Even if it works out, I still won't *know* I got a sign, but... I feel like it wouldn't really matter. As long as those kinds of things don't control your life, I think it's good if they can help you make decisions and be happy with them. I think that even if you don't really believe in them, those kinds of things can tell you what you really want and what you don't, through what kinds of signs you want to see and worry about seeing, how you feel about what you think you're getting.

BoJackHorseman,fgequf8,t1_fgcl6vu,1580706880.0,"Even if that's the case, I disagree with it as any sort of universal answer. I mean, it may work for some people. For others, though, the idea of nothing is what they're seeking, because they can't imagine feeling any different as long as they exist, or they feel like they've screwed up/have been so screwed that there's no point in trying anymore. I also knew one person who... She wasn't suicidal, but the idea of nothingness was comforting to her, because she couldn't relax for feeling like she was supposed to be doing something, constantly. For her, non-existance seemed like the only way she could possibly not feel that way. For still others, the idea saps their motivation to live; like, if this is it, or if all consequences are rendered null in the end, what's the point of doing anything? How can you find meaning in helping others when they'll all reach the same, too? That may seem illogical, like, we're here, why not make the most of it while we can? Why focus on the negative and make yourself miserable? That's what I've always thought, what I think now, and actually, what I logically thought even at my worst. I felt frustrated with myself for not being able to find purpose that way. But it's really not something you get to decide. I know someone else who, her sense of purpose comes from making her deceased mother proud. She struggles with depression and anxiety, but this drives her to do great things, and gives her a sense of peace. 

I think it's tempting to say that that's just depression and that therapy can help with it, but, having been through it, I can say that it's not a one-way causative relationship. In my case, while I've had issues with anxiety and depression my whole life, the existential issues preceded that tail-spin for me; I was doing well before I got fixated on that. It overpowered the anti-depressant that had always worked for me, upping my dosage didn't work, other medications didn't work... The therapy that ended up helping me was focused on trusting the logical end-point my obsessing drove me to, and ignoring the compulsion to keep obsessing over the same points over and over. The beliefs I came out of it with are closer to Buddhism than anything else; the implication here is that I believe consequences and emotions can't be escaped, only worked through."

That show has kind of a fluid feel to it in general, the way it focuses on change and evolution, how this is exemplified in the way some characters are shape-shifters...

Rebecca Sugar, who wrote many of the show's best songs (and also many great songs for her own show, *Steven Universe*), is a great song-writer. She's especially good at storytelling through song.

askapsychologist,ffru04r,t3_ej6awj,1580165794.0,"Obligatory not a psychologist, but, as an obsessive shipper myself, this is something I've been extremely interested in for a long time. I started to major in psychology to study it, but that gave me an existential breakdown. Now, studying Language and Literacy Education, I've returned to that interest, trying to bridge media psychology and education. I did a literature review on the identification with media characters, and some of the stuff I found was striking, especially because it used almost the same words to describe what I'd been saying about myself for years.

See, when I was in my early 20s, it bothered me a lot that I was so into shipping, yet never seemed to develop strong romantic feelings for anyone myself. I thought there was something about the way I was wired (and indeed, I do think it comes down to wiring -- I've been obsessive about shipping since age 7) that made it so that shipping did something for me, but not real life. As for what that something might be, introversion, imagination, and sensitivity seemed like the biggest factors to me. I'm an only child, and so I grew up relying on my imagination. I started shipping because I felt so good feeling that connection between characters; this led me to reimagine scenes and imagine how the relationship might develop. Then the feeling became the point, so what might actually happen wasn't as relevant. And I don't think loneliness played a role. At that point in my childhood, I had many friends who I enjoyed playing with. Even so, once in a while, I wanted to be in my head shipping; they'd ask me to come play, but I wanted to be on my own.

But why the focus on fiction? Well, to start out with, something I'd been aware of since at least the age of 14 was that, the reason shipping mattered so much to me in the first place was that the emotional brain doesn't differentiate between fiction and real life. We feel characters to be real. And where does that reality lie? Their emotions and thoughts are really my emotions and thoughts, so these characters are really a part of myself. Essentially what I'm doing with shipping is fulfilling my own romantic desires vicariously. But why would that work and not real life? The most obvious thing is that we have access to characters' thoughts and feelings in a way that's next to impossible in real life; music and other emotional cues also play a role.

But I still had the feeling that there was more to it than that. When I thought deeper about it, I picked up on something else; I am (obviously) an extremely self-aware person. I feel a strong sense of my individuality. When I'm in conversation with someone, I'm thinking about my role in the conversation. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; maybe I'm thinking of something I could say that would be helpful to them. But nonetheless, I'm aware of myself as a person separate from them. On the other hand, when I'm engaged with a narrative, that usual strong sense of self fades into the background. This allows the self/other barrier to blur. When I mentioned reading descriptions of myself in scholarly articles? This is what I'm talking about. Apparently, it's basic to theory of identification, and I think the fact that I, a layperson with no motive beyond describing my own emotional experience, came to the exact same conclusion, speaks to the validity of the theory.

It turns out that my fears about being unable to feel that way in real life were unfounded; I really have to get to know someone to feel that way, attraction comes out of that for me, and the awkwardness and pressure of dating makes it hard for that to develop in that context... Essentially, life circumstances just hadn't facilitated my style (I was basically too awkward to function in high school, and then I went to a women's college; turns out I'm pretty straight). But I do fall in love in ways similar to how I ship; it involves daydreaming, that person getting into my head, feeling their presence even when they're not with me.

As for the connection to matchmaking, I, personally, don't really see one. As I said, the constructed nature of fiction and lack of self-awareness involved are what facilitate that kind of identification, and I think that's why shipping occurs in that context rather than with real people. When real people *are* involved, it tends to be with celebrities, which is closer to fiction for us than real life.

When I was researching identification, I did look for material on shipping, but alas, I didn't find anything. If you're interested in this kind of phenomenon, though, I suggest researching *identification* and *parasocial relationships/parasocial interaction (PS-R/PS-I).* There's also a concept called *inclusion of self* in other that's very similar to identifiation. There are other related concepts like *transportation* (immersion in the world of the narrative) that... Well, the distinctions are blurred, but the research I looked at did suggest an interplay of the various concepts, which I thought justified their distinction. One foundational researcher you might want to look into is this Dr. Jonathan Cohen of the University of Haifa in Israel."
askapsychologist,ffrs4oe,t3_elmnil,1580164602.0,"Obligatory not a psychologist, but since you haven't gotten any other responses... I have some ideas.

The first thing is, there's a sort of righteousness to that kind of anger. Like, it makes you feel better about yourself when you focus on how others aren't measuring up.

Second, I do think that kind of emotional arousal can be addictive. Anger and fear are closely related (in fact, I've heard it said that it's impossible to experience both at the same time, since both originate in the amygdala). And we like being scared to some extent, we enjoy the adrenaline. I've heard that people don't necessarily want to be happy, they just want to feel something.

I think there's also something to be said for practicing arguments in your head. Not only do we prepare ourselves in case the argument actually occurs, but we benefit from justifying our own argument to ourselves. I think... Since the argument never actually occurs, we have trouble letting it go. This may be because we haven't fully processed it. This is just my speculation now, but... You know obsessive compulsive disorder? It probably has something to do with processing information, attaching the new to the old. Since OCDers use compulsions to cancel out their obsessions and associated anxieties, their brains don't process them. This leads to the obsession coming back stronger, because the brain wants to process information. On an experiential level, I think it's like, when you keep avoiding an obsession by performing a compulsion... Of course the fear the obsession is based on never occurs, but it feels like the compulsion is what's stopping it. Whereas if you didn't perform the compulsion, you'd start to learn from experience that nothing bad is going to happen. Anyway, I feel like there might be some kind of relationship to what you're talking about. You keep obsessing because you're trying to resolve the issue within yourself."

I've had kind of a hard life -- periods of horrible anxiety, my mother killing herself, foreclosure on my childhood home, losing my dad... No siblings or anything. I do have a few close friends, but people tend to come and go in my life. I work as a server, which, I don't hate it, but it's not what I want to do with the rest of my life. For a long time, though, I didn't have any direction about what else I wanted to do. I felt gray for a while, and I thought I'd always feel that way.

Then a couple of things happened. I'm really into cartoons, and I was watching *Rick and Morty.* You know that episode where Rick and Morty get rid of their toxins, and they're all happy and positive, and Morty says they should listen to one new song every day? That had been something I'd been thinking about doing for a while, and that gave me the inspiration I needed to finally do it. I started listening to a lot of new artists on Youtube, and I found some that I *really* love -- The Oh Hellos, Tall Heights, Darlingside... And many others. I don't have a car and have to walk everywhere, and I started listening to music while I walked. I would get bursts of euphoria doing this, and sometimes my surroundings started to feel strange and magical. I'd only been to one or two concerts in my life, but now that I was getting into all these bands... I live in a music hub, and there's another about an hour away; the musicians that I love come to venues within walking distance from where I live, and, since they're not all that well known, the shows are affordable. So I started going to shows, and... It can be something akin to a religious experience. Seriously, I have a drink or two, and it's like my edges start to blur. I kind of meld into the music, and my body remembers how to move naturally, and I get euphoric, and... Some of these artists write in ways similar to how I think (extended metaphor, that kind of thing). Being in constant contact with that was the motivation I needed to finally start writing poetry. Then, someone I went to a concert with (who I wouldn't have otherwise been hanging out with) was in a poetry group here in town, so I started going to that, and I've been doing well with it! Granted, this *is* a creative activity, but even if it weren't for that...

The other thing that happened is, you know how they came out with the new *Hey Arnold!* movie a couple of years ago? I went back and rewatched the series leading up to that. I thought I probably wouldn't care about it as much as I had when I was a kid. Haha! No, I ended up getting way *more* into it, because... I understood it as a kid, but there was a lot of subtle nuance and complexity to the characters that I'd missed then. I related a lot more, and I got more emotionally involved. That was kind of a breakthrough for me, because... I thought I'd grown out of that part of myself that got so invested in fiction like that. This took me back to that place, reminded me that I'm still the same person inside that I was when I was 8. 

So... Yeah, that's my story."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffroxou,t1_ffqkt93,1580162589.0,"Bingo. So many modern movies (especially kids' movies) focus on telling us to buck tradition and follow our dreams, which... I think the message that you should do what you really want to do is a good one, but it becomes a problem when it's given too much weight. It has the unintended consequence of making audiences feel bad if they don't have a burning passion for some career path, and also kind of implies that following tradition is bad.

And let's look at that idea of following tradition. Sometimes I envy people who lived a long time ago for having their careers determined by what family they were born into. I'm not sure the past was really like that; it might be an over-generalization, but in any case, the idea is appealing to me. Because there wasn't all this personal weight assigned to it, and you weren't left to wonder if you made the right choice. And you didn't expect your job to make you happy. It wasn't that you hated it, you might've taken pride in your work, providing for the community; it may have made you feel connected to something bigger than yourself, your ancestors and skills passed down through generations. But you also took joy out of your family, leisure time... Of course, I'm sure this is an idealization. Many people back then probably did feel trapped, and many had no time for leisure because survival took all their time. But I think it does say something that the idea of it is so appealing."

AskReddit,ffjxsac,t1_ffis3rk,1580009888.0,"I have this issue. But it's not that I'm never a part of things, it's that I let people go too easily. I don't feel guilty about it, exactly, because it's likewise with them, but... The reason is, I'm very independent and enjoy my own company a lot. My home is within myself. I also have a lot of self-esteem, which, the reason that's important is, I don't feel ashamed or embarrassed about much, and I have an easy time opening up to people. What all this means is, I have an easy time making new friends, and don't get attached very easily. Which can also be a huge benefit; I think the part about independence and enjoying my own company is why I recovered so quickly after my dad died (which made me an adult orphan). And it's better now, because I've been working with the same people for a long time, and I'm really close with my roommate."

EDIT: It does seem the middle stitch is supposed to be slipped, as someone else suggested. This gives the stitches a more rounded look."
