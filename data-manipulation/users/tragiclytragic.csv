CasualConversation,fej4991,t3_epdriw,1579156318.0,That’s awesome my parents became citizens right before I turned 18 they were in america from England for 17 years. They took the test and both passed! It’s so awesome! My mom for real did not know anything but she studied so hard and it paid off. It’s a definitely a special moment for everyone

offmychest,fdfjuhn,t3_el19zu,1578363395.0,"I feel like this every year just push through it’s hard but you can do it. Take every day one at a time and just try to find stuff that makes you happy ! Spring is approaching so there will
be more sun and light! Good luck you can do it!"
AskReddit,fdexbnr,t3_eku2yp,1578348571.0,Taking your mind off stuff and finding what really lets you show the negative emotions. Boxing or any type of martial arts can help yoga or pilates. Weed. Cooking and baking. Anything works or a combination. Whenever I get stressed I usually sit down and think what is stressing me out and how can I get my self out of this or what activity can help me get my mind off of this until it is over.
CasualConversation,fd7u9st,t3_ek1ilh,1578210200.0,Wow that’s awesome! I’ve worn glasses for 20 years and I can’t imagine life with out them I hate contacts and have always been too scared to look into surgery. I’m glad you shared your experience!
AskWomen,fcwvwvt,t1_fcwvnqk,1578039848.0,"Yes if you don’t entertain it they will
eventually cave. Like don’t pay attention to the negative instead just go
about your day and if they refuse to talk so be it."
AskWomen,fcwveod,t1_fcwustd,1578039227.0,Exactly I feel the same way it’s better to step away then to just completely ignore
AskWomen,fcwtlin,t1_fcwtbrp,1578037083.0,I understand this too sometimes I freeze myself and have to stop talking before something bad gets said but my partner usually knows he fucked up when that happens lol
offmychest,fcwls75,t3_ejam11,1578029205.0,It’s okay now that you have another life to take care of the world seems scarier. Just try to stay calm and if things get worse move immediately. If you can offer help to your friends and family and find a safe place before it gets worse. Hopefully things will settle down soon and you can have a happy and healthy pregnancy! Congrats!
offmychest,fcwljc2,t3_ejap8c,1578028999.0,"It’s illegal for him to even have them
or send them
out he will get In trouble before you do cut off all communication. He is risking a lot to expose this. I wouldn’t worry about getting your parents involved unless you trust them to respond correctly. You are only 13 and you should try to be more careful with strangers. It’s only for your safety that I say this."
offmychest,fcwkexr,t1_fcwkbc1,1578028055.0,I understand when i was younger I felt this type of pain a lot. It gets easier and you learn to deal with it and if you wait the right amount of time you will find a person that absolutely adores you.
offmychest,fcwk5iz,t3_ejah5o,1578027840.0,I’m in the same boat but honestly you get to learn so much. You will already have parents to talk to and help you and friends can help also. It’s basically like living at home but instead you may be a few miles drive away lol
offmychest,fcwjyj1,t3_ejahqd,1578027678.0,It’s okay! Keep your head up you will find someone that loves to hear everything you say and beg you to say more. Please do not waste your time and damage yourself loving this person. I promise you that it’s better to hurt now than down the line and after a few days you will feel so much better and lighter. Trust me do not waste your energy for someone that does not put effort into even listening to you!
relationship_advice,fcw9i0d,t1_fcw97qv,1578020237.0,That’s not what I was saying of course I appreciate him and I do help him i just had a day off and was asking how to deal with the loneliness not everyone is self centered
NoStupidQuestions,fcmgylo,t3_ehz7om,1577774875.0,When you exercise it makes your heart stronger and more powerful. Also it helps muscles grow and protect you. I wouldn’t say you can fully reverse it but exercise is literally magic and can heal many things. You may not be 100% healed but probably pretty close.
loseit,fcmgsf4,t1_fcmgmcy,1577774688.0,Also don’t adjust until you can eat all the calories for that day. Sometimes it is hard to reach the daily amount I wouldn’t suggest an increase if you are struggling to reach the current amount. and for the knee the elliptical is great and so is the pool. Try some knee strengthening exercises like leg press or squats but keep the weight light to make sure you aren’t pushing it. If you are interested a yoga class can help you discover some good stretches and poses and your trainer can help out with that as well.
loseit,fcmgmcy,t3_ehz7pr,1577774505.0,Yes the best thing would’ve to adjust when you plateau or when you increase the intensity of your workouts. I’m a kinesiology major and we just learned this.
CasualConversation,fcmej44,t3_ehwg8u,1577772366.0,"I feel this on a spiritual level. Soon I will be graduating and getting a big girl job and i’ll be forced to stop. i’m so scared to stop smoking tbh. Like I don’t know how i’m going to do it. I have gone two months, but that’s the longest :/ Regardless of me loll I am still so proud of you! I hope to get there one day!"
toastme,fcmec3n,t3_ehxrsx,1577772176.0,oh wow this is beautiful. I hope you continue making paintings it seems like it’s your thing!
AskReddit,fcm2uor,t3_ehs0tf,1577762791.0,"I have never posted nudes with my face or made a video but I have done some cam stuff. However, one tome my mom told me she saw a porn video and her and my dad thought it was me. Kinda didn’t need to know my parents watch porn looking for me lol"
explainlikeimfive,fcls4t7,t3_ehv0ss,1577755131.0,is that just juul? or the other brands too because those come in many flavors and I just see menthol and tobacco for juul
offmychest,fc3fv0w,t3_efvdyw,1577388881.0,That’s so special! I would be crying! Such a good friend
