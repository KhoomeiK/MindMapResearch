AnimalsBeingBros,fdqt59p,t1_fdpnimt,1578674325.0,"Pitt bulls were pretty much designed by humans to be fighters, hence the bite, the muscle, and the low center of gravity.  But fighters aren’t fighters just because of their physical build.  Dogs that make good fighters are aggressive and predisposed to violence.  This behavior has been favored generation after generation in terms of breeding for fighting.  

The end result is a dog that’s physically designed for fighting with a predisposition for aggressive behavior.  This is summed up pretty well by the statistics."

WTF,fdqkjte,t1_fdqjbs3,1578668900.0,This line of reasoning doesn’t really make sense when I looked at my medical coverage.  It covers chiropractors and acupuncture but does not cover massage that’s classified as stress relief related.  I think there’s been far more conclusive evidence that massage is an effective stress reliever than the effectiveness of chiropractics.  Massage is probably about as cheap if not cheaper than acupuncture / chiropractors.

WTF,fdqisxe,t1_fdpb4pw,1578667712.0,Serious question:  why is care such as acupuncture and chiropractic manipulation covered under some major medical insurance providers?

AnimalsBeingBros,fdqefxd,t1_fdqaqsu,1578664528.0,"According to that site, 284 attacks were Pitt bull.  The next closest was Rottweiler at 45 attacks.  That’s an insane amount of difference that i doubt even the factors you mentioned could totally account for.  The evidence is pretty damming.

Edit:  and why mention that Pitt bulls have a very powerful bite without following all the way through?  Why do Pitt bulls have a powerful bite?  Humans have pretty much had a say in the look and temperament of dogs for thousands of years - why are Pitt bulls this way, along with a stout and muscly body with a low center of gravity?  Well, historically they have been used for fighting... which explains all of these characteristics.  But hold up, just looking mean isn’t enough for a fighting breed, it would certainly help to have an aggressive temperament and a predisposition for violence, right?  But that would mean that they’re potentially dangerous pets to have around.  And surely there would be some evidence if this were the case?!?  Well as it turns out, the stats indicate that Pitt bulls account for 66% of attacks whereas the next closest is 19.5.

technology,fczjy2f,t3_ejdi50,1578102877.0,"In my opinion, the most honest and straightforward answer is:  there is absolutely no concrete proof that this is being done.

As someone in the IT field, I gotta say, it’s pretty suspect that all the security researchers and all the kings horses and men have yet to find any evidence of this.  Supposedly this has been going on for years and we haven’t heard anything solid.  Security  researchers and enthusiasts are a pretty crafty bunch.  Almost nothing is impossible to crack or break.
