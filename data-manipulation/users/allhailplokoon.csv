dontyouknowwhoiam,fde32p0,t1_fddban8,1578330083.0,"Black holes are pits of gravity that can bend space time because of their dense centers (aka singularity) that are formed when a star goes supernova and collapses long enough to begin the aforementioned singularity. 

They also don't serve of purpose from what I can gather.

However there are some fun facts that I learned about black holes that I didn't know before for example:

There are three categories of black holes
1.) Primordial- black holes that are the sizes of atoms but with a massive density
2.) Stellar- medium sized black holes that can grow up to a size 20 times greater than the mass of the sun. 
(Did you know that it is theorized that there are at least a dozen in the milky way?)
3.) Supermassive- absolute behemoths of a black hole that can grow up to the size of 1 million suns combined. 
(Large galaxies are theorized to have a supper massive black hole at the center of them the big boye at the center of the milky way is named sagittarius a.)

Black holes cannot be seen by any normal means because of the strong ass gravity that pulls light into its center.

And finally our sun is believed to not be dense enough become a black hole.

Here are the incredibly useful sources (found via phone) that were nice enough to dumb it down for my feeble mind.

dontyouknowwhoiam,fdcwpvt,t1_fdcwczv,1578286538.0,"But even if its theoretical, if the data is basically giving the implication of a massive black hole then that should be enough to at least think holy shit that's neat.

But a few tips, don't worry about having crappy weapons or star cards because they're easy enough to get. Just play the co-op it pits you against enemy AI but you can still level up your classes and unlock the weapons (weapons unlocks require kills with that class).

Play the game in third person, first person is actually terrible.
