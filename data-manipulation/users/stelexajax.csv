MaladaptiveDreaming,fekzo2m,t3_epftcx,1579210940.0,"Hey I'm looking for some help. I'm 16 and have been doing this daydream thing for as long as I can remember. I just found this subreddit 10min ago it's been by far the best thing thats happened to me in the past year.

How do I escape this?
It's ruining my social life. I've been isolating myself for 2 years now just ignoring what was hurting me. I was ready to end it all since I was sure Im going crazy. You seen like your making progress and I just don't want to miss any more of my life. Also is it supposed to alter your world view?  Thank you and Im happy your doing better, it gives me hope."
