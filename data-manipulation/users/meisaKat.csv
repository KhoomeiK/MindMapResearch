dogs,ff7wle5,t1_ff7vpwx,1579660083.0,"I agree.  And in the USA,  greed is bound to get involved leading to nowhere, other than more dogs.  In the case of the puggle though..... even if they can’t bring it to a standardized breed..... I would rather have a healthy puggle, than a pug who’s nose has been so pushed in that it can no longer breath properly.   There are some good pugs out there, but they are getting harder to find."
dogs,ff7o723,t1_ff7nfzf,1579654273.0,"Because you know every puggle breeder in the world?!?   You sound like you have a problem with developing new breeds, which is fine, but that is not going to stop people from trying.   Again,  I agree with you that the majority won’t breed properly...... but that doesn’t mean that it can’t be done."
dogs,ff7n886,t1_ff7lcob,1579653592.0,"Ordinarily, I would agree with you.  Most breeders of designer dogs are just doing it for the money.  However, there are some designer breeders, such as the puggle, that was designed to get the temperament of the pug, without the health issues.   I realize that there are breeders out there that are just breeding pug/beagle mixes, because they are cute and they sell..... but there are some out there that are doing it for the love of the dog...... some have standardized the breed and are now breeding for the amount of generations of those standards to create a full bred dog.   Some are also doing this with the doodle breeds.  I realize that because of the amount of backyard breeding..... it’s hard to tell and although I don’t agree with breeding dogs for money...... I don’t completely disagree with promoting a healthier breed of dog.  The US has not done a good job at breeding dogs..... but I do believe that there are some reputable breeders out there."
dogs,ff79u0f,t1_ff78o1v,1579644110.0,I guess I should have worded it differently...... traits are bred in..... then standards are maintained.
dogs,ff79odx,t1_ff78o1v,1579643998.0,"No , that’s how breeders keep to a standard.  If it’s a full breed of dog that is already recognized by various clubs, AKC, CKC, etc.  ...... that already have standards that need to be met.   In the designer breed world, when you want a Lab with curly hair, you add a Standard Poodle.  When you want a Pug that can breathe easier and be more heat resistant, you add Beagle.   In the full breed world, the standard needs to be met.  When pups are born off standard..... they use to kill them..... now a reputable breeder to neuter or spay and sell into a pet line."

dogs,ff702so,t1_ff6zfoe,1579638425.0,That is very true. I’m talking more on the way the western world breeds dogs vs. old countries.  This can be argued to the point that some older countries will no longer allow their prized breeds out of their country.  The greed for money in breeding dogs has totally screwed the lines of many dogs when let out of their point of origin.
dogs,ff6z7eo,t1_ff6yl5w,1579637915.0,"I agree that the older the marker, the stronger the line, but the peke was still designed at some point."
dogs,ff6v6iy,t1_ff6mvsw,1579635546.0,"Full bred dogs are still a mix of dogs.  Standards in dogs are met by mixing breeds and then picking the traits you want to keep.  If that mix is bred to a dog with the same traits in line, and you keep going for that goal..... after so many generations, you have a new breed of dog.  I find it funny though when breeders like to take shortcuts to system and interbreed the dogs.  That ends up screwing up the breed and then they have to go back to designer breeding for good traits and healthier dogs....... thus the puggle is born..... pug and beagle..... to correct the breathing of pugs.... now close to being a full breed of its own after puggle to puggle breeding is done for generations."
