It's the encouraging part that doesn't sit well with me. What if I'm 200 cm, insecure and want validation, so I did 1200 for 2 months and get 5000 upvotes, which pushes me to do more? That's not a good picture."

No income? Make minimum wage? Sure, just walk into a hospital and go out with no worry.

And most countries with ""insane"" taxes are paid more because of those taxes.  
Like, a minimum wage job in US is **7.25 USD**, but the tax in USA is on average 27% tax.  
But in Denmark, minimum wage is **21 USD** on average, because of their insane 45% Tax.

**Even if you paid 10% taxes, you're literally making less than Danes who pay 45% taxes.**"

Again, what armor do you actually use? You haven't told anyone yet.

Upgrade from High Rank to Master Rank because that's gonna give you 50% more armor easily, get Lvl 3 vitality, eat veggies in the kitchen, get moxie and insurance too, upgrade your palico to lvl 15 on healing, get max potions, put ice resistance on your armor etc. etc.

Don't use flash, it's gonna make the whole thing more random and you won't learn anything.

The more you hit the head, the more it will get knocked down.

Use your grip claw more, when it is knocked back and stops to drool, that's when it is time to grip claw and slam it to a wall or just tenderize it for higher damage. You can also spam grip claw to the body and deal damage while it is flying.

Also, be patient, circle around it, heal, go in, deal some damage, back off and heal more.

Complaining about not doing damage and carting trying to do combos just tells us that you're impatiently trying to end fast. You have 50 minutes."
