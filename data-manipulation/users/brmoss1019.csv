If I was invited to dinner in someone’s home, I would eat whatever they prepared because that’s what a gracious guest is expected to do.

mlb,fetadkl,t1_fet6zyr,1579373296.0,"Not exactly. In the NFL, videotaping is legal, depending on the location of the cameras. This is a very well known part of the game, as the film is typically used as game film study, post game or for use to prepare for a future game. It’s not something that’s utilized in real time that would (or should) impact the outcome of the game. The Patriots were punished because they filmed from an illegal location, after a league memo was sent out regarding location of filming. It wasn’t a written rule at that point, so Belichick interpreted this as a recommendation rather than a hard line rule. He was wrong, and he admitted to his misinterpretation and they were punished. The primary difference for me, is that the Astros players were actively involved. Like 76,000 emails related to this scheme to gain an in game advantage."
mlb,fet6owt,t1_fet53cu,1579372263.0,What happens if you cross the streams? It would be bad… Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light.
mlb,fet6881,t1_fesedue,1579372164.0,"Astros used a camera positioned in center field to steal signs during games. Team personnel would watch the feed in a hallway between the clubhouse and dugout, and would relay what was coming by hitting a garbage can.  So, this isn’t scouting. This is Spygate on steroids. If you can figure out signs within the confines of the game, without the use of tech, that would be different. It’s not as much WHAT they did, so much as the methods and extent of the structured strategy that was used to gain an unfair competitive advantage."
