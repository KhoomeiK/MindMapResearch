cancer,fff4xe6,t3_et8g9f,1579875797.0,"You know your mom better than I do, but when I was in the same situation, the people who made things difficult were the ones freaking out, constantly worried about me, etc.  Keeping things business as usual, but with a slightly elevated concern was much more helpful.  Friends and family are going to make all kinds of uniformed and often pseudo-scientific suggestions for what to do, but just thank them and ignore what they say.  Pay attention to what the doctors say, ask lots of questions, and try to find an advocate for you at the hospital (often a type of social worker who can help navigate things).  Your mom will likely need surgery, then follow on treatments and scans,  

I was diagnosed with stage three kidney cancer, had my kidney and the tumor cut out, but the follow on scan showed it had spread to stage four.  This began a roller coaster of treatment and scans, and more surgery.  The game changer for me was doing a new immunotherapy, that shrank and killed many of these new tumors, Unfortunately some grew and made things bad again. Then they cut out the big one that was causing real problems for me, and follow on immunotherapy shrank the rest.  But then a new one popped up and nearly put me in the grave, but doctors cut it out, then put me on a new pill-based chemo and I have been cancer free for almost a year.

That roller cooler coaster started six years ago for me.  Every case is different, but I want you to understand that stage four kidney cancer is survivable today.  Your mom needs your help, but try not to despair, and be a steady hand in the process."

cancer,ffc2hpv,t3_espft2,1579789895.0,"Good news stories like this are needed too! Cancer can be quite a roller coaster, with highs, lows, and unexpected twists and turns with little visibility beyond the next high.  When you live with the mindset of “waiting for the next shoe to drop,” it can really spoil the highs and keep you in a state of constant burn, wearing you down both mentally and emotionally.  Reaching the point you have, getting several consecutive clean scans while continuing preventive treatment is such a powerfully illuminating feeling.  I was stuck on that roller coaster for five years, and in the last 9 months I finally feel like I can see the car making that final turn into the station so that I can get off.  I hope you feel that way too.

Congratulations and best of luck moving forward."

todayilearned,fehl20b,t1_fehj130,1579118712.0,"Yes, mass is converted into energy during fusion, but only a tiny amount.  And that energy takes tens of thousands of years to get out of the sun and into space.  

It takes a certain amount of mass to compress the core to a point where it fuses atoms.  Low mass stars are able to fuse Hydrogen, but lack the gravitational compression (from their mass) to fuse the resulting heavier elements that have built up in the core.  The more massive a star is, the more gravitational compression it can pump into the core, causing heavier and heavier elements to fuse.  Low mass stars (M class) burn through their fuel slowly and have very boring deaths, while high mass stars (O class) burn through their fuel rapidly and die spectacularly."
todayilearned,fegqxf4,t1_fegqbm8,1579100442.0,"Yup, I was studying astrophysics at the time.

Edit: for a more detailed explanation, gravity compresses a star, and the temperature and pressure is so high in the core that it fuses Hydrogen into Helium.  This fusion process releases a tremendous amount of energy that pushes back against gravity.  A star spends much of its life in this inward/outward balance called Hydrostatic Equilibrium. 

Eventually the core runs out of Hydrogen, and gravity starts to win the tug of war, compressing the core further, dramatically raising the temperature and pressure enough that the Helium starts to fuse.  This process continues to some degree in most stars until there is not enough mass to compress the core further.  The Sun will die this way, with the outer layers blowing off into space, leaving behind the exposed core (mostly Carbon) to very slowly radiate away.

More massive stars are able to continue the process further, fusing consecutively heavier elements.  But stars with a mass greater than about eight solar masses will run into a roadblock when the core starts to produce iron.  Unlike the previous elements, Iron is extremely stable and actually absorbs energy when its fusing.  This cause that tug of war with gravity to completely flip on one side, forcing the core to collapse incredibly fast.  This collapse usually crushes all of the electrons into the protons, creating an extremely compact object made almost entirely of neutrons (neutron star).

With the core suddenly collapsed, like having your leg swept, the entire remaining mass of the star comes crashing down on that compact object.  The compression, collision, and reflection bounces back at colossal power and you get a supernova.

Most of that iron that built up in the core gets ejected into space, eventually finding its way into our blood."

atheism,fegcpdw,t1_fefrz4f,1579087871.0,"I saw an episode of “Donahue” one day after school around mid-80s, and the subject was religion.  The panel had all manner of sectarian mouthpiece, and Dan Barker.  Watching him verbally spar with fire ‘n brimstone preachers and some audience members was electrifying - I couldn’t believe I was seeing a person on TV publicly question religion as a whole in America? 

At one point, a woman in the audience stood out and “I’ve been religious my whole life, but listening to you all argue back and forth, I can’t believe it’s the atheist who is the only one making any sense!”  

With no internet back then and no commercials for the FFRF that I can remember, I started scouring ads in magazines trying to find them.
