videos,fezjus6,t1_fezaj0e,1579458100.0,"I'll tell you a story.
We moved about 30 million worth of vehicles from GM a couple years back. These were only passing though the states and the final destination was PR, and hence had reduced taxation. But for that you need an inbound form and code that has to be reflected in the bol and manifest.
Somewhere along the supply chain somebody decided to write down the numbers using a pen instead of inputting them into the system.
A clerk saw them and ignored them because they were hard to read.
Result? Tha cars were sitting in a warehouse for over a year.
Finally released only to have them send us an audit 4 years later for tax evation when Trump and his cabinet got in.
Then all of the sudden these sort of stuffs surface because someone wants money so looks for errors to get fines for companies or because they want to make their predecesor look bad.

Happens al the time.

McNeil sending raw material to Pfizer for Tylenol manufacturing.

People don't understand that in this industry you back up papers for about 5 years, which becomes 5 years worth of pdf scans of handwritten warehouse receipts and IMHOs.
The volume of data is amazing
 I read somewhere that the next step in logistics is getting rid of this ""hard data"" and going straight out, company wide systems.

He was out into place after a military revolt and pretty much everyone hated him.
His sons went into politics and are the object to popular hatred and spite.
It turns out one of the grandchildren of said dictator ended up working in the same maritime shipping company as me.
Dude was a complete failure, fell asleep at his desk, was always late and full of excuses.
He ended up getting fired and when he did we raided his desk for coasters and pens (as we always did) and found his notebook that he was supposed to use during his training, the dude had written a complete government plan, with economics and public politic ideas (really stupid ones) all based around the idea that he was a descendant of his so hated granparent.
We had a laugh, mostly because he was the son of one of the dictators daughters, which meant he didn't even carried his name... And yet he chose to change his name back to the one his gran dad had.

At the same time it was scary, because my country has such a high level of corruption that its not totally far fetched to believe this waste of air, incapable of typing an email without fucking up or falling asleep would eventually end up as a member of the house or a minister...
