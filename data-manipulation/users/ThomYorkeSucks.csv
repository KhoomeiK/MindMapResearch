AmItheAsshole,ffyjka0,t3_evqd98,1580347954.0,"NAH... Your mom is part of a culture in which she has never been told it’s wrong to post pictures of one’s children on social media. She started making money from it years ago and now she’s dependent on that income. You are of course an individual with rights to your own image and body and you can see present and future consequences that you alone will have to bear for your mother’s continuous choices. You are right to say no more but your mom isn’t a bad person for doing it in the first place. She is wrong but not an asshole.

Maybe try to compromise. Only allow her to post pictures and videos that you approve of, or negotiate to profit off the photos and videos she does upload."

BeAmazed,ffyhdw2,t1_ffxzqeo,1580346473.0,Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. Even if he wasn’t blind or autistic this would be a really stupid idea.
BeAmazed,ffyh9po,t3_evscru,1580346394.0,"Before I get downvoted, let me preface this by saying I’ve worked closely with children and young adults with autism for years and I respect them immensely as individuals. I’ve seen their struggles firsthand and have a great deal of experience helping them and providing therapy.

But seriously, this is a bad idea."
bestof,ffy94im,t1_ffy7jh2,1580340985.0,That’s hilarious. Thom Yorke is a genius and you’re a stupid fuck.

todayilearned,ffy2iyd,t1_ffy0bpl,1580337328.0,You’re right it has nothing to do with how wholesome he is. I didn’t know you had to let people walk all over you to be considered wholesome.

Twitch,ffr2s6y,t1_ffr2jjy,1580149205.0,"A better comparison would be between different age groups or any other grouping. But comparing the data from people who frequent r/twitch with people who don’t use it as much, what’s the point in collecting? You can already predict what the comparison will look like."
Twitch,ffr1y1x,t3_eun2w9,1580148679.0,Reddit is not a good place to collect data. Especially on r/twitch when the survey is about twitch usage.

news,ffpmqcq,t1_ffpmlc0,1580098928.0,You’re comparing favorite colors to two people who have different interpretations of the same event. He is asserting that his perception is different from hers. What if his perception is that she fully consented because that’s what he remembers?
news,ffpl0by,t1_ffpksqp,1580097628.0,"No, he was saying that she feels that it wasn’t consensual. In the same thought he says that he believes it was consensual. You’re misunderstanding it. It isn’t really that hard to get the meaning if you read carefully and use your head."

news,ffpbwsd,t1_ffp7ky8,1580091199.0,That’s not what he said though. He said that he understands that she feels that it wasn’t consensual. It’s all in the phrasing.
news,ffpbtc4,t1_ffp8szc,1580091132.0,It’s almost like one of them is lying and we don’t know who.

news,ffosv48,t1_ffo1adn,1580081301.0,"He said the opposite. He said he believes the encounter was consensual, but after looking at her testimony he understood that she feels she didn’t consent.

He still believes the encounter was consensual, or did until he died.

freefolk,ffdp6rm,t1_fez00xp,1579825677.0,I never saw the last three seasons. I stopped after watching the first episode of season six. I can tell you for a fact that people are just emotionally reacting if they say it’s not worth starting. Just watch the first four seasons and then stop and make up your own ending. It’s really that good for four seasons.

gifs,ff211a2,t1_ff20wbx,1579490932.0,"I asked you if any art can be considered worse than any other art including paintings or music. You said they can’t. That’s as blatant as it gets. You don’t think skill, knowledge, or experience play any part in quality of art. Or you’re contradicting yourself. Which is it?

Loser."
gifs,ff20ivh,t1_ff20em8,1579490560.0,"Then what is up with your edit?

Also then you think any piece of art ever made has to be good because art is only subjective. So even art made by children and people with no experience creating art. It’s all just as good.

Nah, I think you’re trolling."

gifs,ff1tlf6,t1_ff1thtw,1579485887.0,So you really think no art can be objectively worse than other art? What about music? Paintings? I’d like to hear this
