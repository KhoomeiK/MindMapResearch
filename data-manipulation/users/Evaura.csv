Slipknot,ffjwkal,t3_eu0uyu,1580008911.0,"I'm not sure if this is one of the people he's referring to, but when I went to see Yungblud, though n o t exactly a band, he did close to the same thing during the song Anarchist. I just thought ""Hmm... This seems familiar.."" I love Yungblud, but to be honest, it felt so awkward because I remembered what Corey said. I don't know exactly what bands he is talking about though."
Slipknot,fffsioz,t3_et94rm,1579890847.0,"The ""danger"" at Slipknot shows is very exaggerated often. Im just around your age, and I saw them for the first time a few months ago, not at all how people think it is. I was in the pit, nothing bad happened. People were very polite and respectful. Kind stranger next to me even gave me some advice on staying safe. Yes you'll get pushed and shoved but thats really nothing. Not much to worry about, hell, the concert was tamer than the Evanescence show i attended, which is shocking. Proves that not everything is what it seems, maybe tell your parents about experiences that other people have had at their shows. My parents took me to Knotfest after calmly explaining to them what actually goes on, don't talk to your mom angry or annoyed, just be calm and mature about it. 

If you still can't go, there will likely be other chances for you to see them."

Slipknot,fdsd5sg,t3_emjvl8,1578699928.0,"Used to be my favorite song off AHIG because of the small details I noticed in the chorus. Its hard to explain so I wont, but it was something about the vocals. I still love it though, the bridge and end are my favorite parts."
YouShouldKnow,fds49si,t3_emlplf,1578694051.0,"This happens all the time as someone with anxiety. I remember one time specifically,when my bus driver said ""Have a nice day!"" I was too nervous to respond so I just smiled at him and nodded, walked along, guess he didn't see and he went ""WOW! Ridiculous."" Anyway I cried and never rode the bus again lmao it was such a small thing that really made me feel like shit.

 Also being really anxious makes my hearing muffled and its hard to hear. I dont like when people feel ignored by me, because i really dont mean it."

Slipknot,fdixenv,t3_el7by4,1578453221.0,I would say AHIG just because I'm not a fan of Corey's lower sounding screaming style. I still like the songs a lot though
Slipknot,fdix3o9,t3_elmcr6,1578453021.0,My favorite track from the Iowa album. Corey really goes off during the bridge and I love it.

Months later, he sees a poster i have and goes ""Aren't those the fuckers I took you to see in concert? Ill never forget their ugly faces, sometimes I still see them in my nightmares."" I think that sums up how my dad feels about them."
Slipknot,fczeg3f,t3_ejondr,1578099348.0,"close, its ""holding on to letting go"" which the idea of letting go in this sense is to move on from passed problems or passed mistakes, anything troubling, and he'd be holding on to that idea by moving on"

There's this no trespassing sign on a broken wire fence next to an abandoned barn, dead stringy trees, the place looks straight out of a horror movie. So uneven you don't even know if there's even road in some sections. This post reminded me of that terrifying place and now I'm spooked, thanks."

I do use daylio, it's been useful. With what's logged I've seen I've had two month long depression and being suicidal immediatly followed by an intense high for a while. Ive definetly made some terrible decisions during elevated moods, i mean i started a business ffs and i have a huge debt. Its embarrassing. 

I appreciate the insight, it's very helpful. Thanks so much!"
bipolar,fc85rgv,t1_fc84twu,1577527482.0,"I definetly considered that everyone experiences disorders differently, i know it's not the same for everyone. The stories I've read on a support group do come first hand from people actually living with bpd, and I still could not relate to anything. Quick question, how long do your anger days last? I've had irritability last for almost a month and I'm wondering if that's normal. 

I have been using a mood tracker for quite a while now, it is quite helpful with seeing patterns. Thank you for the advice and encouragement, i really appreciate it!"
