RPGdesign,fetutu0,t1_fets3od,1579380246.0,"Well - the first talent just let you get your character level instead of the armor bonus, but some armor had secondary benefits like a bonus to fortitude defense. The second talent let you get half of your armor's bonus too.

Basically by level 10ish, any strength build needed both talents to have a good defense, while dex builds (most in that game) could just go without armor, as it likely wasn't worth the two talents, since with their dex bonus they didn't benefit from heavier armies anyway."
RPGdesign,fetkgzp,t3_eqkf6m,1579376350.0,"For something like armor, it works fine. However, be careful about things that the PCs have to use their character's resources for, as no one wants to get stuck with abilities which end up useless. Or let them retrain them etc.

Actually, the Saga Edition of Star Wars did the armor thing. You got a boost to defense equal to your level, but not if you were wearing armor. It made it so that armor was great for the first few levels, but by level 3-6ish, armor actually lowered your defense unless you spent 1-2 character talents to bypass the negatives. It worked fine, and it fit the Star Wars vibe where few of the main characters wear armor."
RPGdesign,fetipqz,t1_fet1vbc,1579375843.0,"I agree that it shouldn't be a nonsense word, but there are plenty of other words you could use.

It could be Clout, or Presence, or Charm, or any number of other things which fit and aren't ""Charisma"".

I know that's one reason that I went with ""Brawn"" rather than ""Strength"", because it has a broader usage than D&D's Strength attribute. (Adds to your character's toughness etc.) 

The only attribute in my system which is the same is Dexterity, both because there isn't another easy synonym that fits, and because after splitting off Agility, it's pretty much what D&D's DEX does - it boosts attack rolls & helps hand-eye skills."
