todayilearned,ff7tbrb,t1_ff71921,1579657859.0,Cici’s ain’t the best but it’s definitely not the worst. For $5.99 it’s not bad at all. The cheesy bread and the apple strudel dessert pizza are my jams there.
IdiotsInCars,feyxbe7,t1_feyvaji,1579451568.0,It’s infuriating to me. I’m from the south but I’ve lived in NH for 5 years and as much of a pain in the ass it is to clean 10” of ice and snow off my car I’ve never failed to do it once. We got 8” last night and I’ll see dozens of cars and trucks with a slab of snow on top of their car driving down the highway today.
IdiotsInCars,fewie9d,t1_few2rag,1579411153.0,In NH it’s illegal to not clear your car. Jessica’s Law named after the girl who was killed because of the exact situation you just described.
IdiotsInCars,fewi1to,t1_fewhgda,1579410949.0,You have to literally look at it before you get in your car. It’s willful laziness that can and has gotten people killed and is illegal in many places.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fd9slrg,t1_fd7gh2l,1578237580.0,"Fort Benning, which is about 2 hours south of Atlanta, is a base with a lot of basic training. Since Christmas exodus just ended you probably saw all of the trainees who got to go home for 2 weeks coming back to base. 

It’s nothing new to see at Hartsfield-Jackson. Trainees are constantly traveling into and out of that airport."

I moved to new New England 5 years ago and I visit NYC at least twice a year and NYC is one of my favorite places on the planet. People are far from rude and insufferable. I love NYC."

aww,fcmdwkn,t1_fcm0w49,1577771765.0,"You’re the first person I’ve met with a dog named Little Puppy other than myself. She was the runt of the litter from my previous dog’s first litter. A friend of mine was supposed to take her when he moved into his new apartment so we just called her Little Puppy while we waited because she was in fact, the little puppy.

Long story short he never moved and the name stuck and here we are 11 years later with a dog named Little Puppy lol.
