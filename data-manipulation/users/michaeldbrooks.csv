A while ago, I saw someone doing 30 (the speed limit) and the guy behind was right up his arse. It then leads to two lanes, left lane for going left and right to go right. The person tailgating went into the left lane and as soon as the lights went green, he sped up and turned right undertaking the law-abiding driver."

veganuk,fff52h4,t1_fff24fp,1579875900.0,The only pizza place that delivers to mine is dominoes and I really really wished they did a vegan alternative. I’m keeping my fingers crossed they’ll see the light side.

Edit: turns out you can’t buy them from their site, but even though they’re advertised on there, I’ve still never seen them from where I shop."

CasualUK,fejgcdz,t1_fej9irp,1579172918.0,"My wife sold her car on eBay and the people that won the bid came to test drive the car after winning and said they didn't want it because there was no power steering and were worried their daughter wouldn't be strong enough to steer it.

We let them walk away without buying the car and they left a negative review saying ""No good"". We tried to dispute the review with eBay saying how they never actually purchased it so they shouldn't have left any review, but eBay wouldn't remove it and said we'll just have to sell more and get more positive reviews.

Very frustrating and we decided not to use eBay to sell our car and instead try local ads which worked for us in the end."

I think it still uses some virtualisation behind the scenes, but it does it slightly differently to the current Docker on Windows implementation.

WSL2 can be used in current preview builds, but hopefully, it'll get released in an official release this year."
