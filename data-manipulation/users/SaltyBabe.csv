ABoringDystopia,fg4gfgl,t1_fg3f2id,1580502887.0,"Most of the masks still allow small particulate through, they cannot block many viruses. Environmental pollution masks will not prevent viral infections. I’m post lung transplant and my clinic sent out multiple emails and put signs all over the clinic that these masks don’t work for pathogens. So unless you have a specific type of mask you still can get sick they *can* provide the benefit of reducing how much you touch your mouth and nose which can prevent illness but most people I’ve seen still just pull it down to eat or whatever and don’t wash their hands before they do so there’s no net benefit. 

If you don’t want to get sick you need a specific type of mask which must fit airtight you your face, wrong mask or gaps between your mask and face make it pretty much not worth wearing and if you’re not washing your hands regularly you’ll likely get sick anyway even if you do have a proper mask that’s fitted."

When in reality a lot of local honey is literally table sugar they’ve been fed because of dirth (most places require SOME supplemental feeding at least part of the year regardless) yes honey is somewhat time consuming compared to factory farmed sugar but ONE super (the standard size part of a hive) can be 80lbs!! It’s just really not especially difficult or expensive to keep bees in most places and local raw unfiltered honey isn’t doing anything for your body BUT might have botulism or a spore bloom in it (have to pasteurize it) to each their own, I filter and pasteurize all my honey so I have fewer buyers but I feel better knowing I won’t make anyone sick."

todayilearned,fg0ka3n,t1_fg0d5lh,1580409504.0,"They need to collect from ~2 million flowers to make one pound of honey. Rhodies do make a lot of flowers but you’d still be looking at keeping an entire large orchard. This is assuming you don’t have to deal with dirth or any other number of issues bees face which lowers their ability to forage or produce honey. Generally you harvest honey in the fall and feed during the winter, it’s mostly sugar water with a supplement - rhodies do not flower all year long. On the plus side they’re easy trees to maintain and very hardy (they’re my state flower and I own many, I also keep bees) it just would be rather expensive over all when you can spend $200 and have a fully functioning bee hive as is and sell “local honey” to people who don’t understand how bees/honey work for $8 for a small jar."

You driving there and back probably uses more gas for that item than an optimized delivery route would and don’t worry it came covered in plastic and packaging when it arrived at the brick & mortar store you bought it from. Anyone who has ever worked in retail sees the dumpsters full of shipping and packing materials, the only difference of buying it at a store is you don’t personally have to look at that part of your purchase.

whitepeoplewritingPOC,ffr5e0h,t1_ffok62f,1580150824.0,"Thank you for addressing this point. I, like I’d assume most of us here, is average, I also happen to be white. Growing up with this mentality that average/white is “basic” or boring or standard hurts everyone, you have little girls of color being treated as some exotic goods and *especially* when you’re younger being singled out for your looks can feel really bad but it can also teach you that it’s all you have then you have little white girls growing up thinking there’s nothing special about them, they need to act out/look different/modify their bodies etc. it’s a system that damages girls. Instead of appreciating everyone for their own personal unique look and personality we end up putting women into categories that inherently define them.
