gardening,fcuxhn6,t3_ej1riv,1577990497.0,"Definitely done by people, not deer. I agree that you should be able to leave flowers on your mothers grave with at least some slight sense of security; a storm blowing them away or animals eating them is one thing, but it’s kinda messed up that you have to worry about other people coming and straight up clipping them. I would contact the owner/manager and threaten to file complaints with any applicable agencies, and maybe that will motivate them to put more focus on security. Unfortunately i dont think cemeteries are a super competitive business so your complaints may be met with apathy.
