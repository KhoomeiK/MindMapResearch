In terms of things like working out, staying hygienic and dressing well, yes, those are all good tips for absolutely anyone. But to mention facial features and ""changing"" things, it almost sounds as if you're telling the OP to get cosmetic surgery or something to ""fix"" their looks, which would be absolutely horrible advice.

The ones I'd change are: 

Amanda: 15, 16, 20. (I much preferred her China game over her love story with Ozzy.)

Ozzy: 13, 23, 16, 34. (his SoPa game may have relied on his physicality, but I still found it more interesting to watch than his midnight snuggles with Amanda and Alexis in Micronesia.) 

Penner: 25, 13, 16. (He was gone quite early in Micro, and he was great while he lasted, but I rank his original game higher in terms of both entertainment and gameplay.)

Stephenie: 10, 11, 20. (She was made to look like a hero in Palau, and it worked, but in Guatemala, I thought she was just nasty and unpleasant.)"

I was grasping at straws trying to justify why her whole first episode would be all about Dan's groping, I convinced myself that their little chat on the beach would lead to them working together and ending up in the finals.

In RI, he brought his core 4 all the way to the end, in HvV he didn't flip on anyone or really have a chance to, in All Stars, Amber was his earliest alliance in the game, his next closest allies were Rupert, Jenna, Big Tom and Alicia, he brought them as far as he could until he *had* to turn on them. And yes, Lex and Kathy thought he would stick to pre-game plans, but that's their own ignorant fault for not realizing that in-game dynamics could change everything. As for Marquesas, it's been ages since I watched it, but I can't remember him being much of a flipper then either.

So yes, he is a very good liar and he has many victims, but if you're an ally and a number that he needs, he'll protect you. Parvati would be safe with him to start with, but I imagine they'll both want to target each other right before merge."

It's annoying that she was so underedited, but many great female players were back in the early days.

survivor,fejftc4,t1_feh5efh,1579172161.0,"Rob would never be first boot on any season, he's a camp and challenge asset."
survivor,fejf556,t1_feh0ue9,1579171163.0,"I'm really hoping no-one will be purpled, but I know that's probably wishful thinking. The IoI edit was quite balanced despite the twist, so hopefully we can get another decent edit despite the return of EoE."
SpoiledSurvivor,fej9npo,t1_fej7etj,1579163003.0,"It's possible that whoever started that rumor considers S23 to be old school, but I'm aware that is a stretch. 

I'm going off that very loose and probably already debunked spoiler about Sandra and Sophie having a feud, which I was thinking could lead to Sophie raising the flag. Just pure speculation based on their personalities, both are very sassy and have the potential to get very nasty if a cat fight breaks out on EoE.

Trust me, I know it sounds like a stupid theory, but I'm keeping it out there in the 0.1% chance that I end up being right."
SpoiledSurvivor,fej9ekf,t1_fej7ucn,1579162656.0,"Definitely possible, I don't know much about Danni, so not confident enough to say that she wouldn't quit."
survivor,fdmzitl,t1_fdlpov6,1578572474.0,And Ozzy being blindsided with the idol.
SpoiledSurvivor,fdlqq2c,t3_eldyba,1578530231.0,"A lot of people are guessing it's Amber, but I'm really hoping it isn't."
SpoiledSurvivor,fdlqkwe,t1_fdiwiox,1578530131.0,I'm kinda hoping that everything we've heard so far is either guessing or trolling and no real spoilers have gotten out.
AskReddit,fdctq2q,t3_ekokb0,1578284045.0,Almost anything at all.
survivor,fd9pm83,t1_fd7d0rm,1578236428.0,"I don't care if they're ""Z list"" or whatever you want to refer to them as, I'd take a shout-out from a Survivor legend over almost any other celebrity. Like I'd literally rather a shout-out from Queen Sandra than the actual Queen"
survivor,fd9dnim,t1_fd6dmpa,1578231989.0,I was looking for Baylor lol
SpoiledSurvivor,fd99g0p,t1_fd5cjrj,1578230260.0,"I guess I don't really know how to convince you otherwise, and not that it matters, but I'm a big fan of Rob and Amber and would hate to see them go so early, so this bootlist is horrible to me. And the only person in this final 4 that I actually like is Michele. 

Anyway, think what you want."
survivor,fczfz92,t3_ejhucb,1578100408.0,"Ok, I'm all for you returning, but I have to ask you a very important question.... How would you feel if you step onto the island and find out you're playing with Baylor again? 

You know we love drama, so nothing like a little rivalry to spice up the pot."
SpoiledSurvivor,fcz2ahb,t3_ejh80g,1578092225.0,Still betting on Sophie being the quitter.
SpoiledSurvivor,fcz1xwu,t1_fcxpde9,1578092030.0,"Don't think so, Sandra has talked about that in interviews, she wanted Rob to take the reins, she considers him a better teacher, she was fine coming across as more of an assistant/sidekick."
SpoiledSurvivor,fcz1b9y,t3_ejl9z9,1578091706.0,"Michele is someone that we know for sure lurks around places like here and CTS, etc. I think she'll take any opportunity to troll a little bit and see if it catches our attention. She's out there right now, sipping on champagne and giggling at us."
survivorau,fcz0lo4,t3_ejky85,1578091245.0,"All Stars 2 with all the awesome players that missed out on All Stars 1. 

Kidding, hopefully it's just a newbie season, maybe they'll try a captain season with 1 or 2 previous players on each tribe because it worked out well with Luke. Maybe Sarah and Samuel? Or Anneliese and Benji, that could be fun. Perhaps even BvW? Who knows? We'll just have to wait and see, probably won't know much until All Stars is over."
survivor,fcwm4rx,t1_fcwldu7,1578029499.0,"Some people have different senses of humor, and like different types of people. The person you responded to is allowed to dislike Chris and Tommy, why is that a problem?"
CasualConversation,fcvs3pk,t3_eiz4ce,1578008847.0,"I started at 13, quit at 23, I'm 29 now and haven't touched a smoke in almost 7 years. 

If I can do it, anyone can. 

You've got the right idea by the sounds of it, you're keeping yourself busy and disciplining your mind with other activities, that is very important, you just have to get through those first few weeks of hellish withdrawal. 

The toothpicks are a nice touch, for me it was lollipops and chewing gum, anything to keep my mouth busy, and for months, people would always see me with a lollipop stick in my mouth lol. (Also a great way to tackle a binge-eating habit.)

Music was a life-saver for me, but it's different for everyone, so if digging into books and meditation apps are more your speed, then go for it.

A few more little tips: 

- Keep a record of each day, doesn't have to be a full on journal entry, it could be as simple as writing one little dash to signify another day passed, I kept a tally, my first attempt lasted 30 days, then I relapsed, my second attempt lasted 65 days, then I relapsed again, my last attempt which I headlined in my journal with the heavily bolded words ""**DO NOT GIVE UP**"" had a tally of about 700 or so before I stopped keeping count. So if you slip, just use that as a reason to kick your ass to try again. 

- Tell yourself you hate the taste, you hate the smell, make your mind hate cigarettes, look at disgusting pictures of what smoking has done to people, remind yourself that you will be fitter, happier and healthier without them, not to mention saving plenty of money. If you do this and then relapse, it should be easier to try quitting again.

- I kept a single cigarette in front of me for a few months after quitting, it was a constant temptation, but I resisted, even through the physical, mental and emotional hell I endured during that time, so if you're prepared for that challenge, give it a shot, and if you make it through, your willpower will be strong enough to handle many other things that come your way in the future.


TL;DR: **Good luck. YOU'VE GOT THIS.**"
survivor,fcvmooa,t1_fcvi0cq,1578005399.0,"I understand your frustration and I was personally very happy that the pre-game alliances of All Stars fell apart, although it cost Rob the win, which just adds to why they are a problem. 

But there's no real way around it, especially at this point in the franchise. They didn't know an All Winners season would ever happen, they weren't catching up outside of the show just to set up game connections, it was just real life. The fact that Survivor alumni all hang out together is a beautiful thing and I wouldn't change it, it's a huge community, almost like a family for a lot of the players. 

People like Yul and Denise, etc, all had just as much opportunity as everyone else to hang out beyond the game, and I'm sure they knew when they signed up for S40 that not doing so may cost them. But anything can happen in this game, and I think many of the more connected players respect each other and although they may go into the game with alliances, I hope they'll be understanding if things don't work out, I don't want a repeat of the pathetic bitterness like we saw from Lex and Big Tom in All Stars.

And aside from all of that, some people are more connected than you would think, especially the winners, they've all gone to events together, so either they get along or they don't, we'll just have to wait and see."
