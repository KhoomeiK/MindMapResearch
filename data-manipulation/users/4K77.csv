An additional 5 use words that translate to knight, some loosely. And another handful translate to mounted warrior or rider or horseman.

The majority of those use horse or a translation of horse. More than half. In fact there are more languages that use the term jumper than knight. Chinese and Hindi both use ""horse"" so it's safe to say the biggest majority of people on Earth would call that piece ""horse""
