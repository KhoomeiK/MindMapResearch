Yes BC has much more that it's built up over the years. I don't expect ours to boom over night because yes we need more investment to bring projects, and we need the projects coming to demand building more infrastructure for it. It will take time but it's very viable. I mean we just did Ghostbusters 3 for fuck sake.

We aren't trying to replace anything here, we are simply trying to bring more of the share to here. I don't like the fact that the industry needs tax credits either, I do agree with your point there in a race to the bottom but unfortunately that's not going to change here nor anywhere else."

And from theCalgary Herald:

""this year was likely the biggest year ever for film and television production in Alberta. Major productions in the province included the new Ghostbusters movie, which filmed in and around Calgary. He estimated the industry will do more than $300 million in business this year, which puts us fourth in the country behind heavyweights B.C., over $4 billion; Ontario, over $3 billion; and Quebec, around $2 billion. Manitoba — around $270 million in business, according to Azevedo — is just behind and threatening to pass Alberta. B.C., Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba, all of which employ tax credits the Alberta government is emulating, do not have annual caps on its credits, said Azevedo. """

Calgary,fc39yfu,t1_fc21xf1,1577385037.0,"I should clarify. What happened (and I don't have all the details) we had some kind of grant program, which from what I heard was confusing to apply for and productions often didn't like because they didn't know if they would qualify ahead of time. This would make them understandably wary. This was since at least ndp and I think prior.... The industry wanted it switched to a tax credit system for years. Similar programs exist in other provinces. The UCP did finally switch it to tax credit. However it has a very low cap, meaning it's not that useful beyond maybe a production or two. Compared to BC which has an uncapped tax credit which brings in billions of dollars of productions annually. They have dozens of film studios compared to Calgary having one, and are constantly backlogged with lack of production space.

And to confuse it more, ucp stated the first year of this budget was a mix between the grant due to existing payments or projects or whatever they said, and the new tax credit. While the credit is budgeted to increase each year, it's said only an uncapped credit will do what is needed to grow the industry and keep it here, growing.

While I wish we didn't need a credit at all, it's just the industry norm, just like tax breaks for attracting big companies. Everyone does it to try and attract business there over somewhere else, and if we don't have it someone else does."
