> “Hi, I was offended by that little comment your gf made last night”

This is obviously a hypothetical text message derived from OP stating, ""This morning my boyfriend gets a text basically saying my joke upset her and she didn’t say anything last night because she respects my boyfriend and didn’t want to cause trouble."" Clearly there was a message sent to OP's boyfriend, and obviously the woman mentioned that she was offended.

> “Ah, yeah fair enough she feels bad but she didn’t mean anything by it”

I think any reasonable person would do something similar to this. OP didn't mention anything to this effect, but I'd assume that he'd apologize on his girlfriend's behalf. I think this is a reasonable assumption.

> “Ok. Now I never want to see her again. In fact I would prefer her to never again be in my presence. I am putting the onus on you to warn me if she is going to be around so I can avoid the situation like a petulant child, and I’m sure things won’t be awkward at work after this exchange that is totally a thing that normal adults do in the real world. Have a great day! PS why does nobody like me? It’s so hard to make friends xoxo”

Obviously much of this comment is caricature. But OP did state the following:

""But she never wants to hang out with me again and wants to be warned when I will be coming out so she knows not to come.""

So yes, this woman is overreacting to the nth degree."

hockeyrefs,fco9o8j,t3_ei5vit,1577826928.0,"> some have suggested that I should, with no exceptions, always give the 2 first and then go to the 10 if necessary.

Those kind of refs are called bad refs. I know a few refs like that that read rules as ironclad, no exceptions, no game management. But that is almost never the truth. There's almost always room for interpretaton, there's almost always exceptions, and you almost always have to apply some game management and change how you call your game.

&nbsp;

As an example, a couple seasons ago I'm reffing a game with my supervisor on the lines. Team A is taking way more penalites than the Team B, and I'm penalizing them as such. During the second period, I've now called 10 penalties to 2, and I've put Team A down 2-men short twice in a row. Team B dumps the puck into Team A's zone, and the goalie comes out of his crease by a few feet and freezes the puck. As per Hockey Canada rule 10.3 (b),  this is a minor penalty, and situation 3 seems to confirm as such. It's ironclad. It's black and white. I have no option but to call it.

... but I didn't. After the game, my supervisor asked me about it. I straight up told him, ""Officially, I didn't see it. Unofficially, I saw it and I was not about to dump the 7th penalty in a row that period to Team A. Game management call.""

I was sent to do the championships in that division later that year. You probably made the right call for your specific circumstances."
