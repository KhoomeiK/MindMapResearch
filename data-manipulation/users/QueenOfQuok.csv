TIHI,ffc0h2y,t1_ffby65b,1579788374.0,"Yeah, that's the most immediate problem with this image. I can see where he taped the pages to the binding but he used scotch tape and that stuff is weak. He would have to use duct tape or packing tape for a proper binding, and maybe stick on a new cover made of card stock. Otherwise these things wouldn't survive very long in a backpack. He's traded one portability problem for another. Oh well, they're his books.

They'd better be his books."
TIHI,ffbztur,t3_esor06,1579787863.0,"Funny thing is -- books used to be published in multiple volumes even for the shorter works. I think it was supposed to make simultaneous access easier for library patrons but maybe it was just a matter of meeting the reading public's impatience. They DEMANDED their latest installments, especially when it came to stuff by Dickens. The docks had massive crowds waiting for the promised shipment of new volumes. It was serious business.   


This situation is a bit different and harder to believe, because I've never had much trouble with portability even for the thickest volumes. But hey, if this guy wants to make his books lighter that's his problem. All he really needs to do is add new bindings to each volume, because he's ruining the already-cheapass binding of the paperback. He's going to risk losing pages of each volume if he carries them around in backpacks. That's why books have covers in the first place! But that's his problem because they're his books. I think he understands that issue because you can faintly see scotch tape on the spine where he's trying to hold the outer uncovered pages on. Definitely not a permanent solution but at least he knows the downside of his actions.   


The fact that he added the tape also leads me to believe that this is sincere, and that he did not do this on a moment just for an internet chuckle. Maybe he has significant issues with portability because his containers are small or his arms are weak or he has to deal with strict weight limits as part of his job. I don't know. This all seems like so much work to go through for the sake of whining about a book's weight but I don't know his life, so I'll begrudge him the question of portability.  


What I worry about is the possibility that his habit would become rote, and lead him to ruin someone else's property unthinkingly. I don't want to lend him a book if he forgets it was a loan and thinks it's his and then cuts it in half. I would get real mad if I got a book back in more pieces than I expected.

ShittyLifeProTips,fejft6x,t1_fej0n1h,1579172155.0,"That's something I wonder about. My Facebook feed is strictly private, I'm not on Instagram or snapchat or WeChat or any of those things, and the only social media website that features my name is Linkedin where I'm not posting political viewpoints anyway. So what do you do if you can't find anything about a candidate's politics through your social media search?"
pics,fejawsj,t3_epbtj8,1579164777.0,"The strange thing about this case is that I saw a photograph of Mr. Phoenix and...if you had not told me he had some sort of cleft palate I would never have realized. I don't know how anyone noticed or why anyone cares. I cannot find a single photograph of him online that even vaguely resembles what Ms. Williams is doing in this photograph. I do not know why Ms. Williams cares enough about this man's incredibly subtle facial anomaly to make fun of him by wildly exaggerating it on national television.

Based on other comments in this thread I am sure that i could not get an answer from her without enduring baseless scorn myself, so perhaps the primary issue is not anything to do with Mr. Phoenix himself, but that Ms. Williams is -- and I rarely make these judgements about someone's character on an inherent basis -- a horrible, horrible person. I would never wish to meet this woman. I do not think I would come out of the encounter well.  


Unfortunately, as long as she keeps doing horrible things to people on national television she will remain famous, because television news and internet discussions reward controversy more than they reward common decency. I did not know the least bit about this woman before she went after Mr. Phoenix. I think that i shall forget her again, until she does something else horrible. Perhaps she knows this, and that is the reason she treats people terribly.   


So then, perhaps this is a moment in which the full force of Cancel Culture is justified, because if the TV ratings for her show dwindle then her incentive to harm people may diminish -- or at the very least the scope of her power would shrink, and most of us could get on without lives without worrying any more about this bitch."

So for all you know they're not muscular at all because the guy always skips leg day. Or maybe they're robotic. But then if he could replace his legs with robotic enhancements, why would he be at the gym? Why not just replace his entire body? Then if he gets trapped in a building he could just punch his way out, and then get confronted by the police, and shoot their blockade to make it explode, and then transform into a motorcycle and lead the FBI on a wild chase across the country until he is finally met by his match: His wife who replaced her body with a cyborg form years ago. The impact of their blows is strong enough to affect weather patterns in the surrounding regions, and that nudges a thunderstorm into becoming a tornado, which rips through downtown Mahagano, Ohio, and rips through the Our Lady Of Sorrows Foster Cat Care facility, leaving but one lone cat as the survivor, who vows revenge upon the true source of their sorrows: God himself. And in response to a cat clawing his face, God flips the island of Bora-Bora upside down because he was looking for an excuse to do that anyway. Next thing you know the Vatican has been set on fire by angry Christians trying to get revenge on God without knowing how to get to him like cats do, and the Pope has fled to a cabin in the middle of the woods of Siberia, leaving the Faithful to turn to anyone else, and they pick the cat, but some of them worship the cyborgs, and thus the new divisions of faith form out of the ashes of the old. The world is changed, and much is lost, for none now live who remember it.

suspiciouslyspecific,fdrzuq1,t3_emrdan,1578692211.0,"6 months ago, working on a novel, haven't saved in a while. I think I'm fine even though it's Microsoft Word because I'm working on a Mac, haven't ever had this computer crash, what could possibly go wrong.

Well I get a message that says the document can't save because there's not enough memory. And I'm like what? I've got plenty of storage left on this computer. What is Word talking about? Turns out the program itself has a certain amount of internal RAM that's low enough to be filled up by the amount of writing in all the word documents I had open...and I'd only saved one of them recently. And I haven't backed up my data to external hard drive in months. Closing the only document I can close isn't enough to get Word to let me save anything, and I have no idea if letting Word save my documents as ""Recovered Document"" will work and I don't dare risk it. I wind up having to copy-paste everything into Google Docs so that I can quit out of word without losing my stuff.

But that wasn't the worst I've ever seen Microsoft treat anyone.  


My friend was working on a data report for her legal internship. Big project, grade's riding on it, school career's on the line. Been working on it all day, it's due tomorrow. She's got most of it done. She goes to save and  


the whole thing disappears.  


Both of us nearly threw a fit. Especially when there was no sign of it in the autorecovery saves. Her brother managed to find it in an obscure folder but before that point we both thought all was lost.  


Lesson learned: don't just save often, back up your data often, and don't trust Microsoft applications."
