AskReddit,fcembfg,t3_dh84sn,1577621754.0,When my two friends and I were playing a game they pushed me underwater to try and suffocate me. Their excuse? ”But were mermaids and their prisons are underwater and he scratched me wahhhh.”   If you're still wondering why I scratched you jasmine it was because you were drowning me. (this happened when we were like 7)
AskReddit,fcel87z,t3_dgicv9,1577621508.0,"There was this guy that tried to suffocate me the backstory is he was always a place of poop expect when he’s playing video games stealing my stuff. And one day I remember something about him lying to his mom (this was a LONG time ago when I was like 7yrs old he was 12) so when his mom found out he was lying he blamed it on me, so as any totally sane person would do he tried to suffocate me. During this time his little sister was in the room and called for his mom, my mom, and my dad. When they came up and saw him trying to kill me they flipped out he tried to lie but no one believed him. And if I remember correctly he just got a little ”scolding” from his mom.             
TL: DR ”friend” tried to suffocate me, the sister told mom & dad. They put a stop to the murder attempt and his mom just scolded him."
