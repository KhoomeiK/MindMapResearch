OP clearly spent a long time on this and they are proud enough to post it on here, it may not be an award winning drawing but you can clearly see it's not bad and as with anything there is always room for improvement. You must have your own insecurities I hope you find a healthier way to make your self feel better. 

 it's absolutely fine to comment what could be improved but to outright insult someone is out of order. Personally I think OP did a great job of drawing the buzzard and the best thing is their drawings will only get better!
