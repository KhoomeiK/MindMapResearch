It was a blind hill and he was driving into oncoming traffic. That was putting multiple people's lives in danger. Thank goodness for that pull off. As a truck driver, you will learn it is safer to maintain your lane because you don't know which direction the now oncoming person will turn, out of panic. This entire situation was NOT safe. Yes, if I am going to same direction as an oncoming emergency vehicle, I will move over, if I can safely do so."
