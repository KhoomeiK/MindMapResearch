If there's no deity, then this life is all there is, and everything is important because of that. How we live our lives is ALL there is, how we treat one another is ALL there is. Being kind, being ethical, being interconnected with each other and the world around us is ALL there is. And it's as beautiful and tragic and painful and joyful as we allow it to be. Yes, pain and sorrow are inevitable, but so is joy and love.

This is a good thing, really. First, it gives you a clear trail of 'went NC/they retaliated by falsely accusing me' in case they try grandparent's rights crap. Second, CPS is now on your side - they know you are a good mom and that your parents are creeps. It may be worth, if you can afford it, paying a couple of hundred bucks or less to an attorney to send a Do Not Contact letter, so that any attempts to harass you after that are clearly unwanted and can count in your favor in any future legal proceedings.

If you have to engage, engage with the same level of disinterest that you would to a stranger on a bus. Don't make a big deal out of ignoring her - that's still attention of a kind and she can play victim and be all dramatic. If she talks to you, just do a hmm and shrug, then wander off to do something else or pull out your phone. One word answers and mild disinterest are fine. Just. don't. bother. It'll drive her absolutely insane."

relationship_advice,fdezy92,t3_eku797,1578350205.0,"Man, if you were my guildie.. I'd want to know. We could play together more, distract you when you wanted. I'd make sure I was there to listen if you wanted to vent, or crack jokes with you if you wanted to laugh. I'd want to do my little part to make your remaining days happy. 

That being said, this is your life and your death. You should be doing and saying exactly what you choose and nothing but. Anyone who gets in the way of that isn't helping. I wish you as much control over your fate as is possible. I wish you nights without pain and days full of laughter and peace. I wish you a passing that's swift and easy. You deserve all of those things if you can't have good health and long life."

When I moved out I was completely prepared to live an independent life. I don't see how OP's kid is doing too much. Looks like less than 1/3 of the chores needed to take care of a house. By the time he's 18 he should, like I did, take on a full third.

I come from a hunting family. I don't actually remember when I first fired a gun, but I had to be less than 8, given context. We have 6 guns in our house. I have no issue whatever with hunting but I have a big issue with muzzle and trigger discipline."
