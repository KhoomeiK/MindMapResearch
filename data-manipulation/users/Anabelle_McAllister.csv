facepalm,ffhywmi,t1_ffe5v84,1579959731.0,"Okay, so here's the thing. Women shouldn't group all men into one homogeneous group that treats women in the same way. By the same principle, men shouldn't group all women into one homogeneous group that treats men in the same way.

Men are subject to societal pressures to ""be a man"". This pressure is cultivated by both women *and* men. I can't count the number of times I've heard men talking about how ""real"" men have beards or don't drink fruity drinks. My male friends even had literal physical ""man cards"" in college that they would give out or take away based on the perceived ""manliness"" of the guy. I'm not trying to say that women don't contribute, because they do, but it's a cultural thing that pervades everything and is going to be difficult to change. That pressure is toxic masculinity; that's what it means.

Women who want their men to ""man up"" and not be ""sissies"" are by and large not the same women who want to dismantle toxic masculinity. Just like how men who think women should be the ones to cook and clean are by and large not the same men who champion for respect and equal opportunity for women in the workplace."
