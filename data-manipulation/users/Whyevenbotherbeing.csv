news,fgg46zq,t1_fgfu36o,1580753882.0,Indeed. If a jury awards a victim a dollar it’ll sure as hell award a million. It’s the floor now. You can EASILY show that a human being who’s been paralyzed in an auto accident needs a million just for rehabilitation and prosthetics etc etc. Second million is for the diminished quality of life going forward. No jury will value your legs at 750 000 when 1 000 000 rolls off the tongue so well and seems so much more substantial. 1 million liability was cool 20 years ago.
