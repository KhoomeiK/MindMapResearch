Makeup,fdmyvuh,t3_em7s3o,1578571800.0,"Gel liner in a pot with a narrow straight brush. Tap it into your eyelash line from underneath and on top, not on the lid. It's very subtle. 

As far as sensitive eyes, you can try it without doing underneath. I've never done that myself though. You dont need much product to get the effect. If your eyeshadow liners are flaking- do you use a eye shadow primer? Eyelids are naturally far more oily than the rest of the face,  so makeup tends to break down faster there without a specific primer. Concealers generally are too oily for the lid.

For removal, soak two cotton rounds in micellar water, place them over closed eyes and leave them there for about a minute to two. Then wipe up and outward, gently. Do not scrub the eye. You are causing a lot of irritation by doing that.
