Its hard to do that with your face covered by a mask. The physical barrier between your own dirty hands and your uninfected face, in itself massively reduces the chances of contracting the disease.

Not that I was talking about the mask protecting the wearer, in this case, as much as the sick person wearing the mask protects others from becoming infected. A sick person's mask contains and limits the virus carrying aerosol droplets from coughing and sneezing, trapping them within the fabric. It also limits transmission of viral particles onto surfaces as it reduces the sick person's contact between contaminated mucus from their nose/mouth and their hands. Remember, thats the primary transmission mechanism.

There is a reason why doctors wear face masks when working in infectious disease wards. They massively reduce the chances of transmission, both from the wearer and to the wearer."

Was it rape? No. 

Why not? ""Yet I never asked him to stop. Even in my drunken state I felt like I OWED him. We had been dating for many months, so I had to let him fuck me.""

If you are making out with someone you have been dating for months and then things progress to where you are having sex with zero protest from either party at any point prior or during and if even your internal monologue is consenting because ""you owed him"" and ""let him fuck you"" then I dont see how that can be considered rape without a lot of missing context. 

Implied consent is the primary mechanism of initiating sex within a relationship, that may be an unpopular sentiment around here but that is how things work in the real world. Being able to say NO is a thousand times more important than saying YES. This may not be how we want things to be in the future, but that is the nature of social norms now. The onus of explicit and direct communication and the blame for its absence does not fall exclusively on one partner, you both failed at it. You both chose not to communicate and to operate by implied consent and body language. 

Scenarios like this are one of the many reasons why there is a need for an age of consent, because young people too often do not know when they can or should just say NO. That said, age of consent is just an arbitrary line in the sand which does not guarantee that people above it will have the confidence and experience to not fall for the same trap. You were not ready and Im sorry that it happened to you. You did not ""owe"" him shit. You did not have to ""let him fuck you"". All you had to do was say no or push him off you or give any indication that you were not interested and he would have stopped (since he was stopped by a pained facial expression). 

Note that none of it was your fault and you were still a victim, just not of rape in this instance. People here may disagree but they are somewhat of a broken clock on this issue, the verdict is always ""its rape"" regardless of the event or circumstance.

PS: Being drunk only becomes a criteria for rape when people are non-functional and unable to consent due to being unaware of their surroundings or being unconscious. You knew what was going on, who he was, what the two of you were doing and you decided to let him do it. If being merely under the influence of alcohol would qualify as rape then half the sex in world would be classified as such."

And we should thank the valiant fighting of the Soviet Red Army and the Chinese Nationalist Army that annihilated the Japanese forces in China and Korea ending the Japanese warcrimes by targeting their soldiers. Rather than the US warcriminals pursuing an ineffective policy of terror bombing against civilians in SE asia, culminating in atomic bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. There is another name for what the Americans were doing, its called terrorism."
