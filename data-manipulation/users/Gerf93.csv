soccer,ffjn6db,t1_ffjh0zz,1580002122.0,"It seems as your reading comprehension is what is lacking here.

This is what you said:

> Spain attacked. Spain pressed high. Spain created chances with their football, not just passed around.

I contradicted you, and showed you how Spain didn't attack, Spain didn't create a lot of chances and Spain didn't score a lot of goals. I didn't say that it was boring, I said it was less entertaining (than scoring a lot of goals).

I think 99.9% of all football fans would agree that games with many goals are much more interesting than 1-0 or 0-0 games. 1-0 games can still be great, they can still have a nerve, and they can still be entertaining, especially from a tactical POV. However, high-scoring games are usually much more intense and thrilling with heartbreak and joy.

I have made my arguments, I have disagreed with your statement based on objective facts, and you have responded with absolutely nothing of substance. You just keep ranting about how I should watch another sport and how this subreddit is peddling the EPL (how on earth is that related to this discussion between me, someone who supports Athletic Club, discussing tiki-taka and Spain at the 2010 World Cup with you...)? Please, make any sort of argument and stop your incoherent, irrelevant ramblings."
soccer,ffjeyv8,t1_ffjd7fv,1579996838.0,"...? Damn, that's some exaggerated reaction.

What take? That the lowest amount of goals in World Cup history indicates that they didn't play blistering attacking football that swept the world off their feet?

Tiki-taka with Spain was a wonderfully efficient and successful strategy. However, it was not innovative in terms of offensive capabilities, but rather in terms of defense. Spain relied on their superb forwards to convert the few chances the team created every game, and to retain possession as much as possible to prevent the other team from attacking (more so than attacking themselves).

If you can't bother to discuss or argue your point, then don't make an argument in the first place, and don't go straight to attacking people who discuss with you. Makes you seem like a knobhead."
soccer,ffjcbr0,t1_ffihsrq,1579995304.0,"Mate, Spain won all their knockout matches in the 2010 World Cup 1-0. That hardly counts as entertaining.

Spain scored 8 goals in 7 matches. If I'm not mistaken, that is the lowest amount of goals scored in a World Cup by an eventual winner ever.

But yeah, sure, best attacking football ever."

A few tips if you'd like, since you're new here (I've been here for three years and have 200 000 more upvotes than downvotes, so I guess I must do something right); you shouldn't care about upvotes or downvotes. Just write what you feel and think, internet points are imaginary anyway.

That just means you're a coward.

Maguire and Wan Bissaka has massively improved your defence, and McTominay has taken strides towards filling the void that Herrera left. Even Fred has shown massive improvement from last year.

Had they not, every new manager would be doomed to comparisons to his caretaker period - and his ghost would echo in the halls of Old Trafford because of his statements that he would always be available for Man United. Not exactly a good environment for another manager.

But now as he has gotten the job, I think giving him a fair chance is warranted. Give him this season, a summer transfer window, and then consider how he performs in the fall. If there are no considerable improvements after two years, then his job should be in dire danger.

Getting rid of deadwood and players with poor mentality is essential, for the re-rise of the club imo. Liverpool was re-built on the backs of super-professionals such as Milner and Henderson, and I think the same should be said for Man United. Now with the exit of Young, Lukaku and Sanchez the first strides towards that has been accomplished (Lukaku wasn't deadwood, but there's something to be said about his attitude and professionalism after his press statements - and the fact that he failed to lose weight and get into shape, even after publicly acknowledging the issue and saying he will fix it)."

I said that the Republicans vote in a more unified manner than the Democrats, and you list two people off the bat who have broken off with the party. While the Republicans are a monolith. Yet you still claim that they are exactly the same in this regard? I'm a bit confused here. 

I don't know if the left has said that, but it's kinda irrelevant. First of all, it is the duty of the opposition to impeach if the executive does something illegal. So saying that they will impeach, if he does something illegal, is not really the bombshell that you think it is. Second of all the President has given them something to impeach him for, several times tbh. And everything around him stinks. From all of his breaks with Presidential etiquette, to sheer incompetence - and this, which reeks of corruption. Third, don't act for a second that the Republicans wouldn't have impeached Obama in his two terms if he gave them something. They impeached Clinton for lying about getting a blowjob.

And if you want to look at pure dishonesty, look no longer than Mitch McConnell, who has said that he won't even listen to testimony or look at the proof, because he will vote against it anyway. Imagine a real judge or a jury member saying that before a court case starts, let alone the chairman of the jury."

soccer,ff2tfe5,t1_ff2spsm,1579523420.0,"With the ""can be said"", I am talking about in practice. In theory Congress and the Executive are two different bodies, but in practice they are not acting independently as of late. The Republicans especially are voting in a very unified manner, universally and uncritically supporting the executive and denouncing their dissenters.

In respect to the judges. I haven't paid too much attention to this debacle that I can cite exactly what has been done. But I believe the decision SCOTUS made with Nixon (and evidence) was up before a judge (in relation to precedence I believe), who ruled against the White House. However, the White House did not produce testimony from employees or the transcript from the call that is the grounds for the impeachment trial.

Also, I believe SCOTUS has a majority conservative judges."
soccer,ff2rhd9,t1_ff2pfl9,1579520847.0,"The scope of what you can impeach for is being narrowed down every single day nowadays. The argument has even been made that you cannot impeach a President whatsoever. That means there is little to no control over the executive branch. Furthermore, the different branches have melted into one in general. As the executive can be said to control the legislative, and the judiciary is fully at the mercy of the legislative. With appointments to courts being fully based on political opinions rather than merit.

The executive branch working against the legislative and ignoring court decisions by the judiciary with impunity is a great example of this.

I agree that the US is, of course, still a democratic country. Be it a flawed one, and on a seemingly slippery slope towards authoritarianism."
