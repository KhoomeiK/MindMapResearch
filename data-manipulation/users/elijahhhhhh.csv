AskReddit,ff521gw,t1_ff48jqq,1579578096.0,"I work in sales, I'm allowed to knock things down to cost. My commission is based on the profit above cost. I've given people hundreds of dollars off just for asking for a better price because theres enough profit to still pay me well. I get people way too oftenwho think they can get a $3000 oled TV for $200 because we also have $200 walmart brand tvs and how different can they really be???"
AskReddit,ff51m7v,t1_ff4yh19,1579577781.0,"Yoo I worked at meijer for a while and all the cashiers had the $5 rule. Technically every employee did it they were in a register. I was just a clerk in the seasonal and toys area mostly and EVERY cashier would call me about any discrepancy whatsoever. ONE TOY RANG UP AT $19.99 WHEN THE AD SAID $19.95 and the service lead called me about it. you can bet your ass I hung up on every last one of those kinds of calls. They tried to write me up all the time but luckily my direct manager supported me. The policy was there to save money through time. It there was a $5 or more difference, I'd check and take care of it. Otherwise leave me the fuck alone. i literally can not comprehend how a cashier could take a company's bottom dollar that seriously. Just use your empowerment and let the customers go."
AskReddit,ff50yqc,t1_ff45qys,1579577291.0,"I work in sales and I had a customer demand to speak to my manager because he wanted a $700 sound bar for the price of the first sound bar I showed him, $270 because he liked the $700 one better. He was acting like he was doing me a favor taking it off my hands for that price, literally $300 under cost. I'm also THE audio guy at my store and he felt the need to explain to me what a subwoofer was for at least ten minutes. Not what he was looking for from his sub, just what the fuck they were for. My manager actually laughed in the dudes face and showed them the cost to profit ratio on the computer. Naturally the guy wanted it at cost but my manager was actually cool enough to tell them that I spent over an hour helping them, how little I was actually making off the sale, and how nobody is here to break even. To top it all off, after I sold them their shit they couldn't figure out how to get it to work, claiming they tried everything, and turns out they thought the wireless sub meant wireless everything and never even plugged the fucking thing in before trying to return it without the box."
AskReddit,ff503sz,t3_ergjyj,1579576663.0,I work in sales and at least once a week I have to explain to a grown ass adult what taxes are. I've lost sales because they refuse to pay taxes and they're isn't enough profit in the item to knock the price low enough to satisfy those idiots.

AskReddit,fdpdxfd,t1_fdn0e91,1578626164.0,"That's amazing. I loved my downtown area, it's 3 blocks up one side of the street and 3 down the other with a pokestop on each block and a gym at the library closest to the water with a bunch of steps everyone hung out on. Unless you were really zooming to each pokestop, they'd be reset and ready to go again by the time you circle back to it."
AskReddit,fdlud99,t1_fdl9g7r,1578532702.0,"God I miss the summer that game came out. I've never seen so many strangers genuinely having fun together outside of mauve a concert but with pokemon, they were engaging each other. I could leave the house at any point in time and drive a couple miles downtown and would have at least a dozen or two people just making idiot laps up and down the main strip hitting all the pokestops and occasionally running into the park across the street to catch something. It was so pure."

HydroHomies,fd2qdud,t1_fd0ys6t,1578150661.0,"In my experience with bro science, fatty foods always helped with hangovers. Some people choose a greasy egg and bacon breakfast, a cheeseburger, or in your case apparently milk which is just a healthier fat. According to real science, it should technically make it worse but consuming alcohol increases your production of a neuro chemical called galanin which, while largely not quite understood, is believed to signal to your brain that you need fatty foods. Literally a case of mind of matter. Combined real science with bro science and fatty foods make you feel better because you're satisfying your brain chemistry that drinking fucks up and has nothing to do with what your body actually needs. You already feel like shit but fatty foods soothe the soul."

AskReddit,fcva5j8,t1_fcu6mx8,1577997835.0,"My dad was a union electrician his entire adult life. He's had surgery on both his shoulders, one needed 3 surgeries. Hes had both of his knees replaced. He has almost no feeling left on his hands anymore from years of bumps and whacks. He was lucky to work at one place for 20 years but after that the union was saturated and work was sparse. For a few years he couldn't pick up anything but short calls which going into them is a month tops before your name goes back to the bottom of the book. Between medical leave, the associated debt, and trying to support a wife and 3 kids while waiting for new jobs, we lost our house and had to file for bankruptcy. The money is good when the work is good, but the abuse your body takes is ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, he had a really good run at the start but the timing at the end of his career ruined him financially and he's too old and broken to work anymore."
AskReddit,fcv4iyo,t1_fcufvwo,1577994489.0,"That's my biggest problem with games these days. It seems like world building is the main goal, which is fine and dandy and logical for an escape, but when the actual game play is so obnoxious and tedious to get anywhere or do anything, it takes away from the beauty of the game. I've been a Nintendo fan boy all my life and I love that, for the most part, their games are all intuitive first and great story second and they do both great. Super realistic graphics are cool but are way overrated anymore. I just wanna have fun, Idgaf what it looks like. Like shit, i can't even tell you how many hours I've wasted in wii sports with my friends. It's just fun first, everything else followed."

AskReddit,fcrz8lo,t1_fcqzjm8,1577908801.0,I'd honestly like to see Bob Ross a little more animated. Not exactly mad but more than the not a care in the world happy calm man he was in the joy of painting.
