>I'm writing today to strongly request that you vote yes to allowing witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Trump. It is imperative for the future of our country that witnesses be heard from. An acquittal without hearing from John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, Mike Pompeo, Lev Parnas, Rudy Giuliani, and others would undermine everything America is supposed to stand for. How can you make a decision on the president's actions without hearing from those who witnessed it and worked with him? Without congressional oversight, our president becomes someone akin to a king or a dictator. That's not the America I know and love, a country that is supposed to represent equality and justice for all, a ""shining city on a hill"" for the world to admire and emulate. Saying no to witnesses sets a dangerous precedent for our future, one where a president can commit any crime with impunity, as long as their party is in power. We're supposed to be better than that. Please do the right thing, vote yes for witnesses before you make up your mind on the president's guilt or innocence.

Those assholes have tried to fuck me over twice and I don’t even have a service with them. The first time they were convinced I had an account with them in a state I don’t even live in that wasn’t being paid, they called me hourly and kept threatening to send my bill to the debt collectors and ruin my credit. They absolutely refused to listen to me when I told them over and over that I didn’t live in that state and the bill wasn’t mine. I had to call their corporate number and beg them to stop harassing me.


The second time they swore up and down for *months* that internet was available at the house we were building. We checked with them at the time we first started looking at the lot, before we put down our earnest money, then 6 months, and a month before we closed. Every time they assured as everything was good, that our neighborhood already had lines ran, and they’d come out as soon as we closed. We called them again a week before closing to schedule them to come out and get it set up, and they informed us that it would actually be $8,000 to run internet to our house. The houses on the next street over had it, but because our house was the first house built on our street they were going to make us pay all the expenses. If they’d told us from the beginning, we would have chosen a different house. I need internet to work since I’m a remote worker for my company and we’d just bought our first house, which completely wiped our savings. We asked if they’d reimburse us once the other houses sold, nope, we would be providing internet installation costs for the entire street. They were the only company in the area that did internet other than satellite internet, which isn’t fast enough to do my work on. We almost had to forego buying the house and lose a lot of money, which we’d saved for years to have enough to buy a house.

But they’re not. I don’t even get why you would think that. No matter what the Bidens did, Trump broke the law. If my friend robs a bank and I break into her house to rob her, we’re both going to jail. There were plenty of legal ways he could have gotten an investigation into the Bidens or held up the aid money if he was truly concerned about corruption, but he sent his personal lawyer on a secret mission, while also extorting the president of one of our allied countries, and stopped bipartisan approved military aid without speaking a word of what was happening to Congress.

One had to wear a helmet because he was constantly banging his head against the wall, another one would get overwhelmed several times an hour and when that happened he would put his hands over his ears and just continuously shriek. They were all non-verbal, couldn’t feed themselves, and had to wear diapers. They all had explosive temper tantrums that were frightening, especially with the older kids. They needed 24 hour care, so most of the time at least one of their parents had to quit their jobs to be home with them. They were very sweet kids, but I know that their parents were devastated when they realized they would never be able to go to college, get married, or even say “I Love You.”


I don’t blame antivaxxers for being scared of having a child in that condition. On top of how draining it is to spend your life caring for your child, knowing that one day you’ll die and leave them alone to the mercy of the state must be terrifying. They’re just assholes for thinking vaccines are what did it."

We ate pizza and french fries every day, it was either that or some weird unidentifiable meat product and deep fried vegetables.

There weren’t predators in the plant and it’s against federal law to have weapons on the premises (for very obvious reasons) so no hunters allowed. It had a lot of nice woodsy areas, grass, and fresh water, perfect  place for momma deer to leave their young. My dad used to take pictures of them all the time, they looked so sweet just laying there as still as possible."

news,fej1wwi,t1_fegw6hv,1579153906.0,"Our HOA basically just forces people to take care of their property so it doesn’t look like shit. No crazy rules, power wash your house if it gets gross, don’t let your yard get out of control, don’t park on the grass in the common areas, things you should be doing anyway. They also throw events for the kids in the neighborhood throughout the summer and keep the common areas looking nice. 


Everyone on Reddit bitches about HOA’s, but there are non-crazy ones out there, and if you can find one it can make your neighborhood a lot better. My in-laws don’t have an HOA and they’re having all sorts of problems in the neighborhood that they can’t do anything about. The dude across the street bought a car and then just parked it in front of his house right in a curve on the street. Some of his neighbors asked him to move it, since it was a dangerous place to block the view into oncoming traffic and he got really angry at them for asking, so he bought *more* cars that don’t run and now there are three parked on the street and several in his yard up on blocks. They can’t do anything, since they live in a small town and don’t have any city codes or anything. They want to sell their house so they can get something smaller and easier to care for, but how can they when the house across the street looks like a junkyard?"

Now that my husband is back in the office and I’m working from home I’ve got my desk set up in the bedroom with her and then take breaks by coming out and snuggling with the other cat. 


The other cat is my shadow and he’s very upset he can’t be me with all the time. He was picking at the door yesterday and I told him to stop so he revenge puked right in the doorway. I opened the door to check on him and stepped directly in it.

We’ve got Pope Army Airfield in Fayetteville, Cherry Point Air Station for Navy & Marines in Havelock, &  New River Air Station/Camp Lejeune over in Jacksonville. I know they’ve got helicopters at Lejeune, I’m not familiar with what else they have, but from my tiny phone screen it really looks like it flew out from Jacksonville."
interestingasfuck,fefwlld,t1_fefswhu,1579067581.0,"It looks like it flew out from my area, and while we do have an international airport, it’s freaking tiny and has to connect in Charlotte or Atlanta to actually go overseas because only smaller planes can fly out from here. It could be a private plane, I know we have private airstrips for all the rich people who live here.


However my money is on a military plane. We have a ton of military bases, the army, navy, & marines all have air bases in this area. I should know, I’m directly in the flight path for some ridiculously loud fighter jet training and they go over twice a day in the training season. When they fly by our whole house shakes and it sounds like they’re going to crash directly into my living room for like five seconds and then they’re gone. 

I’m nearly certain it was one of those fuckers because they’re so fast that by the time I start to hear them, they’re already out of view. I’ve only seen one once, and that’s because I was outside and saw it before I heard it."
interestingasfuck,fefvg0a,t1_fefupx6,1579066484.0,"It looks like it took off from our local tiny airport right on the coast. I wonder who that was. We’ve got a lot of rich people with private planes, so I suppose that could have been one of them hightailing it out of dodge, but there’s also several military bases around here, so it could have something to do with that as well. 


I wonder if there’s anywhere to you can look up flight information for specific days. I’m really curious now as to why they were allowed to leave, since the FAA grounded all flights over US airspace at 9:42am that day."
MonsterHunter,feejzlx,t1_feed16m,1579035295.0,"I wouldn't object to MHWorld (or it's sequel) for the Switch honestly. I love the old style games of course, but with the DLC and events to keep things fresh, I think I've spent way more time on World than any other MH game. I've taken breaks from it every now and then, but I'm still actively playing it two years later without needing to start over to give myself a challenge, which is awesome. With the other ones once I beat G-Rank I would start losing steam, but with World there's always something new happening.


As much as I'd hate to start my character over, it would absolutely be worth it for couch co-op mode with my husband."

antiMLM,fe94oo1,t1_fe8qkko,1578934235.0,Last winter when I went to the doctor they had FOUR DoTerra diffusers going in the waiting room. It made me want to throw up.

The ones who are being helped because they can’t fucking breath. She told her to get out and said she had to take the necklace off before she could come back(because she gives absolutely zero fucks when it comes to patient wellbeing) and she got reprimanded for being rude to a coworker.

All this within a few days with an otherwise happy healthy young woman. 


I know it’s an outlier, but having two sisters who work in the ICU this is not the first maternal death they’ve told me about because something went wrong in an otherwise completely normal pregnancy. It’s fucking terrifying."
