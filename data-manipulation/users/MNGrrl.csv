genderqueer,ffdfvzs,t1_ffd6zjx,1579820021.0,"I believe you've managed sum up the experience quite nicely. A lot of people feel their only identity is a *lack* of identity, including yours truly. It's sometimes easier to say what I'm not, than what I am. I'm not a guy, I'm quite sure of that, but less sure about the rest. Sometimes I feel like womanhood is just what's left after masculinity is removed. Sometimes it feels more distinct, like it has a form and substance of its own too. Sometimes I wonder if 'androgynous' is what everything would be if we weren't buried under tons of toxic masculinity, sexism, and entitlement - and that the entire binary is just a convenient lie, and the only point to the division of the genders in a social sense is to create differences in potential energy, in much the same way we build engines which depend on areas of high and low pressure and heat to function. That while entirely artificial, maybe it's the only way to satisfy the very human need for everything to have an order to it. 


Eventually though, I decided I could be existential about it forever and maybe there *are* no answers and that my journey isn't about answering the question but just living it and maybe the answer comes and maybe it doesn't -- that all that really matters is that I try to be the best 'me' I can be, to trust my feelings and intuitions on this stuff. If I want to wear a dress today, then I should and that is best. If I want to wear jeans tomorrow, then I should because that is also best. What meanings these desires have is less important than acting on them and seeing where they lead."
genderqueer,ffdetty,t1_ffd8lv1,1579819382.0,"For many (most?) it starts with just a general diffuse feeling of 'being different', and following their instincts and intuition to a better understanding of that feeling. Eventually it culminates in an ""ah-ha"" moment or a growing awareness that eventually overtakes any remaining doubt. It's okay to not know too, and not everyone *has* a fixed identity. As an organic process, the way there is as unique as the individual. All I can really offer for advice is to ignore what anyone tells you and follow your feelings. They're like a compass, guiding you in a direction. Eventually you'll figure out what direction you're going, and maybe even where you are, but that's not really the goal; It's comfort with yourself and your feelings. Given that, the rest falls into place eventually."

genderqueer,ffd5o8f,t1_ffcmw0i,1579813908.0,"Okay, I can help. Let's say my gender identity is feminine. That's pronouns, social role, personality, ""who I am"". My gender expression is what I wear - dresses, skirts, lace, makeup. Expression is what I *do*. Appearance, mannerisms, etc.


The thing is, we are all a little fluid. Some days I wear jeans and a t-shirt. Some days I want to dress up and be pretty. Some days I don't. I might feel particularly feminine sometimes, and other times not really at all. But it doesn't change *that* much. I still get uncomfortable when I'm in situations where I'm needing to be or appear masculine, and there's enough consistency I can anticipate how I'll feel. 


People who are more gender fluid *don't* have that consistency. The discomfort comes and goes or is absent, or always present, but my impression is however they land, there's a lack of consistency and guidance from it. It feels quite a bit more random to them. Some reject the binary entirely whereas others seem to just have a wider range they're comfortable with.


This can be unnerving for people because they think gender is something that's inside, a part of them. Being gender fluid is an explicit acknowledgement gender exists *between* us much more than *within* us, and embracing that truth. That who we appear to be depends significantly on who we're around and our environment. When that's understood, it's easier to deal with.


I view gender fluid as a separate axis; it's not masculine or feminine but how far they move along that axis. Some seem to be so fluid they could be anywhere on the binary. Others maybe just pass through androgyny at times but tend to lean one way or another. That's the best I can explain given the lack of language we have to convey the experience we each have of gender"

WTF,ffaryxw,t1_ffabnqh,1579743104.0,"Sequestration doesn't trap the co2 as co2. Usually. It separates the carbon by binding it to another chemical, usually as part of a multi-step process to reduce it to activated carbon or a hydrocarbon. Algae reactors for a biological example. Capturing it is the first step.


Given the high energy demands of doing it as a chemically reversible process, most sequestration will likely be biological. As in we'll seed the ocean with genetically engineered algae that then dies and sinks, compressing on the ocean floor, or as trees that we then cut and bury. Some varieties of trees grow very fast and we can burn them to extract the carbon and filter the gases.  There is a lot of research ongoing but only in a few of them is the first step (capture) ending with it as a pure compressed gas.


The issue is our current tech isn't efficient at large scale capture without a huge tradeoff somewhere. Usually as electricity or because we need a lot of rare earth metals for catalysts. It's a bitch. The most economical option I see is literally what the planet was doing before us : trees. And lots of them.


And we should maybe start now before the tropics become uninhabitable and can't sustain forest growth because most land is around the equator. Forests in temperate and cooler regions grow slower. Then again, I wonder if after those areas can't support human life anymore we'll start to see aggressive grow back as nature repopulates without us mowing it down for cows and such...

Same with sex offender. When it started it meant rapist. Abuser. Real shit. Then it got watered down until the drunk guy taking a piss behind the dumpster was one, legally too. Now a lot of people don't take it seriously - ""everyone is a sex offender!"" well no, but regardless of intention or who does it, we end up in the same place. it goes both ways - not just trolls and social reactionaries do it. People who mean well and ram legislation through to ""get tough on crime"" do it too. The only constant is a political agenda, whether it's malicious or the law of unintended consequences. 


This isn't a problem confined to any particular political orientation or group. We are more sensitive to our ideological opposites doing it, but tend to overlook our own sides' participation. Toxic masculinity used to have a more narrow definition but as it moved into popular use a lot of things for attached to it that was gender neutral and didn't really belong. 


I'm watching an intense version of this sort of language shift happen in my community (gender queer) with a rapid proliferation of labels and language. Part of it is we really don't have the language to describe our experiences but part of it is cultural delineation too. I don't really identify as trans because the culture is heavily shaped by drag queen and gay influences to the point i feel excluded, despite being on hormones and having a diagnosis, and have floated away to non-binary or gender queer to describe myself. And this hydraulic fracturing of our community is being heavily encouraged by so-called allies and social reactionaries alike. 


We're a community under siege because the moment we start to reach a consensus and come together we're attacked. And because we're not that common in general population, most of that community building happens online, making us uniquely vulnerable to this sort of perversion of language for political gain. We don't have the numbers to even represent ourselves in most of the discussions *about* us. It's tragic. 


I don't have a solution to this kind of manipulation because it's so pervasive and emotions run strong. This tactic doesn't really have a name, and until there's a consensus it can't be protected no matter how aware people are it's happening. And consensus is almost impossible because with a few clicks I can have hundreds of identities online. How do I tell who is authentic and who is fake in such an environment? 


I want to fight, but I don't know how. There's nothing to hit back with. It's a natural part of language evolution, but it's being abused to erase and devalue others. It's been weaponized. How the hell do I fight that? There isn't a defense. Whether you're right or wrong, if the majority takes a step over, you either go with or suddenly you're wasting all your effort arguing definitions instead of fighting back at what's hitting you and yours. But if we don't fight it, we lose the ability to communicate with each other, we lose our common ground, and become isolated.

Itâ€™s inconvenient to have roads blocked by protestors, just like it was inconvenient to have their buses stopped by people laying in front of them. Itâ€™s not Civil Disobedience without the peaceful/illegal stunt that makes people get inconvenienced enough stop and acknowledge your beef.


The roads were blocked because thousands, tens of thousands, marched. Not 15 people. That's something protesters today don't get. They could do those things because the crowd was big enough they couldn't just roll up with a couple vans and beat stick you. You need the numbers to do shit like that. Look at Hong Kong - *millions* in the streets. The entire city *shut the fuck down*. And they give way to emergency vehicles. They give way to people trying to get to work. They tell people where they're going to be, because the goal isn't inconvenience. The goal is to fight the system, not the person standing next to them. 


Protesters today are so buried in identity politics they think everyone who isn't a carbon copy duplicate of them is the enemy. Fuck white people, I'mma play my rap at 200 decibels at 2am through a residential neighborhood, ""*BeCaUsE It'S PrOtEsT!*"" Bullshit. Those tactics earn nothing. It's like those critical mass biking events where they deliberately don't plan routes and the aim is to disrupt things as much as possible. People pancake the protesters, and while they're wrong to do that, it surprises absolutely nobody but the idiots on those bikes. Cops and ambulances follow them around knowing what's gonna happen. It's a goddamn inevitability. 


MLK Wore a suit and tie. He made a point of getting white people involved. He always created space for them. Never said the color of your skin made you the enemy. His fight was with a *system* not a *person*. If you were against the systemic inequalities, you were an ally. March. Fight. Put signs up. Send money for the legal defense of those being held in the jails. It wasn't how much or how little, it wasn't a contest - gate's down, come on in. That was the message, and that was the difference. 


Civil disobedience without the numbers and the inclusion is just a puddle of blood full of your own teeth after the police bash your face in, and expecting anything else is just wasteful. And it is in fact possible, but more likely than not, that the majority of today's civil rights protesters gather few followers outside their peer groups because nobody wants to sign up for that.


I've been to a lot of protests. One of the first was for the release of dmitry sklyarov, after Adobe had him arrested for giving a how-to presentation on bypassing copy protection on eBooks. He was a 'copy leftist', and a hero to hackers because the ethos is 'information wants to be free' - the idea of intellectual property is abhorrent and we tried desperately to get people to understand allowing its existence in law would lead to systemic inequality on an unprecidented scale. Which is exactly what happened in subsequent decades. 


I showed up with maybe 5 other people. We had a folding table and a water cooler, and it was in front of the state's federal court building. Two cops approached us; Only people to actually ask about it because in 2001 the internet was still this 'newfangled' thing and most people didn't know the issues. All they asked was how many, wrote a couple notes in a notebook, and wandered off. Everyone else showed up with signs that couldn't be seen from any kind of distance, except mine which you could see from the light ahead. I stood out there all day, burned the shit out of myself. Nobody honked. 


After that, Planned Parenthood, the oil pipeline, LGBT rallies -- I have a lot of experience. I'll tell you what people want and it's not your dumb ass with a sign asking you to honk for support or a clever saying. They want a show. They want violence. If you want 'visibility' start a mosh pit, don't wave signs. Blocking traffic is giving people what they want - your uncermonious end as a human pancake under someone's tires to the sound of ""I didn't see them"". And with only a few people doing it with you, they'll get away with it too. 


It's endlessly frustrating because most younger protesters have no idea how to organize socially or politically. And they resort to those aggressive tactics out of frustration; Which I completely understand. I had a lot of time to wallow in that healing from a very painful sunburn after my first time, but it taught me the rudiments of effective protest and that? That is not it. 


I don't care what side you're on, or why you're taking to the streets. It's your freedom and I support it even if you're a goddamn hood wearing KKK fuck. And I'll be right behind you with my own sign telling you you're a walnut for doing it, all peaceful like too, but I'm not gonna stop you. 


I'll tell you the same thing I tell everyone: If you want to protest, your goal is not a parade, it's not blocking up the streets, and it's not useless fucking ""visibility"". You need money and volunteers willing to arrange meetings with your politicians. You need petitions hand in hand with voter registration and to make your message clear: ""We'll be voting on THIS issue, and THIS issue only. You're on notice."" You need people to strawman and lawyers to defend them in court after their arrest. You need people willing to hit the pavement going door to door to raise money, not a GoFundMe scrambling after. You get the money first, and you have your lawyer standing right fucking there with you. *Then* you get arrested, with fifty cameras pointed at you. ""The gladiator formulating his plan in the arena has already lost"". Two thousand year old advice you should take. 


You focus on small things, what you can achieve. You focus on building energy and momentum. Hold concerts with local indie bands for fund raisers. Get your signs hanging at local businesses expressing their support. Firmly establish that the community you live in supports you and yours, and don't interfere with those businesses. The ones that turn you away - *those* guys you get to fuck with. Ever and always you save your anger for the ones who are your enemies, not the people who don't know what the fuck you're even about, and their first impression is *you're in their way*. Don't do that. 


Does anyone do that though? No. They get frustrated early, lose patience, and then fall to the mantra of ""visibility"" like that'll rescue their half-assed efforts to inspire change by pissing everyone off. Great plan. Zero percent success rate. That's why I don't have much respect for *most* civil rights 'leaders' today. Because they lead their lambs to the slaughter. To arrest records. To meaningless personal and economic loss. 


Blocking up the roads and marching comes at the end, not the beginning, of a movement. It's when you're big enough you're making the news before one shoe touches the asphalt. When you know you're gonna be a show people are gonna want to watch and see what happens because you've got the energy, and now it's time to bring the thunder. When the arrests anger your community enough to bring *more* to your rallies, not fewer, because everyone knows what you're about by then. That's how you win the crowd. That's how you carry the day. 


That's when you're dangerous. That's when the establishment tries to take you down. Because you've got momentum then. You've got the community backing you. When people are blowing up the phones of the politicians and whether they support you or they fucking hate you, you're on their schedule or they're arranging meetings somewhere else because there's so many of you they aren't going to get anything else done. When you're the reason they'll lifting the polling numbers out of the fax machine either to smile or frown, and their staff is telling them they gotta make a statement, that a lot of people are gonna be voting on this. 


Nobody thinks like that today. And that's why they fail."

The takeaway here for me is that they/them should be an option used when people aren't sure, or their appearance suggests it, as with the others, and that's not as common as it could be. As in, we should integrate it, and try to be more aware. It's less about guessing right than creating space."

It's not though. The problem is these early model vehicles use cameras and lasers (LIDAR), but we can use millimeter wave tech to see through objects, like x-rays do, but without the radiation issue. They can see through your clothes in airports, this is not exactly new tech. 


But those arrays are very expensive unlike cameras and laser systems, which can use commodity hardware. That's why you haven't seen them rolled out yet. We're using only the most primitive and restrictive tech for this, and companies thus far have largely stuck to that because the datasets available are from cameras. There's no google maps taking pictures of our communities with high resolution radar systems.


Point of note, since we've already completely abandoned personal privacy, it should be noted this same tech can see right through your house, as well as you naked, so yeah. The manufacture of such arrays for commercial use is going to open up an entirely new dystopian nightmare world. Fun times.

Context matters. If we're being honest everyone has a group that they don't like. Maybe it's drivers in your state, or Boomers, a political orientation, or ""Karen types"", or people from out of state, Southerners or Northerners... The list. Goes. On.


you probably didn't think about that - most tend to only see when people comment about an identity or label that has political gravitas. we live in a society right now where what you are defines you more than anything else, so we've become very sensitized to that. But also desensitized to all the ones that lack a political identity - like ""drivers in my state"".


We have got to understand that disliking some or most members of any group is based on personal experience. That's the basis of stereotypes, and it's not wrong to have them or those opinions.
