relationship_advice,ff5kzzv,t3_eregee,1579597965.0,"Not wanting kids is a normal and acceptable option in 2020. Having them because is what you are supposed to do, is a horrible mistake.

Some people don't want to be parents, and if they become one, they end up messing up their lives and their children's.

Your partner blackmailing you into having kids in order to keep the relationship, in my opinion, is a red flag about the future of the relationship, that may not be saved even doing things against your will. 

I think you should be completely honest with your wife about what is important in life for each of you, and evaluate if your relationship still has a future, especially before there are children involved."

That would make me go back to a few months before my life went to hell.

With a planned 90-sol duration of activity (slightly more than 90 Earth days), Spirit functioned until it got stuck in 2009 and ceased communications in 2010, while Opportunity was able to stay operational for 5111 sols after landing, maintaining its power and key systems through continual recharging of its batteries using solar power, and hibernating during events such as dust storms to save power. This careful operation allowed Opportunity to exceed its operating plan by 14 years, 46 days (in Earth time), 55 times its designed lifespan. By June 10, 2018, when it last contacted NASA, the rover had traveled a distance of 45.16 kilometers (28.06 miles)"
