We had a pit bull and he was the sweetest doggo. Except 2 separate occasions! 
First.
My daughter (5) was riding her bike around the culdasac we lived on. And the neighbor kid was chasing her. But my daughters screams sounded legit. I told the boy to “knock it the F off Malachi is getting upset”.Nope. And Malachi went threw a living room window, grabbed him buy the baggy ass of his jeans and pulled him to the ground. 

Nobody was injured! The boys mom had a good lol and said “he told you to stop”.

Second.
We were sledding. And Malachi liked to chase my daughter down the hill. And tug o war her and her sled back up. Not sure if playing or actually helping. 
 Another dog got loose and charged at my daughter. 
Malachi took that dog down like it was nothing. 

Pit bulls are some of the sweetest, loving, and protective dogs on this earth.
