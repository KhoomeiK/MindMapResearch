funny,ffgnojt,t1_ffglrx4,1579910488.0,"I have stated I am doubting all the sources I personally have. I have stated I've heard different versions from different people (with a certain point prevalent here, of course), and I have no reasons to believe either. Am I casting doubt on your sources? I don't even know what they are, ffs. If it's ""posts on reddit"" or ""articles in mass media"", then yes, I am, that kind of sources often proves to be... misleading and either censored or contradicting similar source. I've only stated that from what I see your sources that you trust enough tell you that rights you approve of people you approve are being violated. I've never said you were even wrong. You might have a proper reason to have that opinion. All I know is there's some revolt happening with people being shot at with gas and such. Real reasons behind actions for both sides are a mistery for me.

On the other hand, you keep attacking me with ""CANT YOU SEE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING"", ""DO YOU SUPPORT OPPRESSION"" and such, and I actually have reasons not to trust you, for example, because that kind of argument is of no substance and people resort to it to target a person, not to prove anything."
funny,ffgkffn,t1_ffgjxoj,1579908276.0,"What am I spreading, again please? You've missed the point of my message, you are accusing me of random stuff now, and suddenly I'm not allowed to even touch any discussion if I don't have a strong opinion? Uh... Well, that's Reddit, I guess, I should go before you proceed to even further highlight the original point of my message."
funny,ffgj7gj,t1_ffgiv81,1579907474.0,"All I've said: I don't have an opinion on the matter and I have right to not have that opinion. Are you denying me that right?

EDIT: I've never claimed it's propaganda. I've never claimed it's NOT propaganda as well. Don't go attributing random stuff to me and then blaming me for the thing you've imagined. Thanks."
funny,ffg80wp,t1_ffg6ee7,1579900452.0,"First of all, the idea I tried to convey is absolutely unrelated to MY opinion on anything.

But honestly, I'm not advocating anything. I don't have any information about what's happening in HK that I can trust (people can write anything on internets, and people retweet what they like, so the point you see depends on the mood and viewpoint of the place you read), and I don't care enough to dig too deep. Your view of conflict from info you have is there's a revolt for rights you approve of people you approve. That's one popular opinion. I've heard other opinions. The only thing I can clearly tell is that I don't know the truth. 

I don't know how to explain it better. Let me give you exaggerated but clean example. Imagine you've heard people in another country could be just caught in the street, put into locked room and forced to do some labor. That's a huge suppression of human rights, right? I mean, such a thing should not be done to people, people should be free. Oh, I've left out a small detail, those people are murderers, and they are presented to court first with proof of their deeds beforehand. Or maybe I've made that point up and those are actually random people... Now what's happening in that country? Would you support rights of those people? 

TL;DR, you have an opinion, a view of a situation based on what you read, see, believe, and probably take part in, and according to it, what's happening in there is bad. It's ok. Is having a different opinion or not having one not ok?"
funny,ffg5ioa,t1_ffg0q0x,1579898899.0,"Yeah, most of it sounds like a problem, but some points... Making fuss of SOME of those points on reddit would actually be an acute case of hypocrisy. There are major cultural differences between countries, there are things they find ok and not ok to display that might be otherwise in another country. Some things are even agreed upon. Countries might have different values. You are sure your values are the best and most correct, but so are they. 

For example, there are a lot of topics and opinions you'd get instantly banned from Reddit or at least communities you share those at for. There are also cases like r/watchpeopledie closedown. Some of this stuff is blatant censorship, and you are ok with it, you keep using and supporting Reddit, it either aligns with your values or you don't care. It's the same with people who use TikTok. Yet somehow you can see something wrong there and can't see anything wrong here, even though idea is the same - it's about protecting and exporting values. And noone wants others' values, best you can get from people who want your content is either ignorance or a pretense of sharing your values."
gifs,fffgv2q,t1_ffcq9tx,1579883677.0,"It's not about radio wave speed, but noise and signal distortion. Basically, signal gets much worse because of reflections, refractions and other interferences, and it leads to lags because of how digital data transfer usually works: you receive data, you check the checksum, confirm receiving if it's correct, report error if not, wait for another attempts to sell same packet. The exchange can get pretty long with poor signal.

The other consideration is data packing, basically the less data you transmit per unit of time, the more likely it's to be received correctly. And lower rate means it takes longer to transmit same packet of data, and once again leads to higher lag.

While on stationary base it's not a big problem to increase power (both output and processing speed), it's a lot harder to go that route for a mobile remote controlled toy (which still has to be able to respond / transmit video data reliably in arbitrary direction), so lag concerns seem pretty realistic to me.

EDIT: Welp, it looks like it uses 4G, eg cellular network infrastructure, so while reasons for lag are still there, they are partially different from what they would be for direct connection that I've considered."
funny,ff7x90j,t1_ff7v7em,1579660528.0,"Long story short, they can't.

Once again, sorry for not knowing exact terms to use, but to convey the idea:
We have a thing called compulsory insurance, kind of a tax, that's supposed to fund ""state"" or what's called ""free"" clinics. They are greatly underhanded AND overloaded at the same time, have harsh limitations and the doctors are super taxed there. Like, you are given 15 minutes for a patient... and have to take like 50 patients a day (I know the math does not really check out, that's the idea). In that time, you have to examine a person, find out the problem, give a prescription / send for examinations/scans/analyses, explain that to the patient, write down everything into medical card and do some more internal stuff I'm not really well aware of (like the other report for insurance company, or something). If you fail anything on the list, well, you might (And most likely will) be penalized.

Of course, there are ""private"" or ""paid"" clinics that don't have that problem (as they are not governed by the same rules as tax-funded ones), but the prices are pretty high, and not everyone can even afford that. There are ways to get most treatment covered by the same compulsory insurance, but most people are not even aware of that, and nobody's really interested in spreading that info, so vast majority avoids those as much as they can. 

It's a positive feedback loop, doctors escape the hell of state clinics for private ones, and the load on the others increases even more. As long as neither system nor people care about the situation, ""state"" doctors don't have a real way to do better, they do try to help, they are only staying there because they do want to help people. Have fun complaining to them that they should try harder and communicate better."
