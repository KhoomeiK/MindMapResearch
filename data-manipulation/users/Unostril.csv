metalgearsolid,fff9wjf,t1_fff8vpi,1579879281.0,Ya I learned the reason Americans have a lot of words with fewer letters than the uk (ex: color vs colour) is because back during the printing press times it cost money for each letter printed so American printing companies would get rid of unnecessary characters so as to save money but get the same word across. I didn’t know check was one of the words affected by this tho
metalgearsolid,fff8rdx,t1_fff55c8,1579878529.0,Yeah America spells both kinds of “check” as check. A money check here is still check just like “check this out” kind of check. We just don’t have a “cheque”
