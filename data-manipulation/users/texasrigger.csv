Ours were on our off season for breeding (too hot) and so were just the breeders.

Yes, that is a real possibility.  Double pregnancies do exist although very rare.  18 babies is almost unheard of in rabbits though and with the underdeveloped ones that is almost certainly what happened.  Who knows what that does to their hormones, it's understandable that everything is out of whack.  With only two survivors I would absolutely shelve them.  Even in a well formed nest I don't think just two can generate the body heat they need to stay at the 100°F (38°C) or so that they want.

homestead,fgfmvdq,t3_ew6d0b,1580742903.0,"This is an older post but I just now saw it so I hope I'm not too late to respond.  There are two major potential issues with a vegan homestead -

First, it's impossible to be completely self sufficient as a vegan homesteader as there are some nutrients (as a vegan I'm sure you are aware) that you just cannot produce yourself.  Now, very very few homesteaders are 100% food self sufficient, I'm certainly not, so whether or not that matters is up to you.  There is no purity test to homesteading and we all do it a little differently but still, it's a *technically* true statement that you can't 100% vegan homestead.

Second, and much more practical, is that an all-plant homestead is simply not possible in all climates and locations.  You have to be in a latitude ""goldilocks zone"", have ample water, and good soil to provide the volume and variety of food you need to fill your yearly dietary needs plus storage can be difficult.  On top of this, a drought or deluge can easily wipe out a season's production and leave your pantry empty.  Maintaining a large garden is also much more time, labor, and possibly equipment intensive than maintaining a flock of birds or a small herd of grazing animals.  All of this means that it's only an option for the very select few who happen to be in an ideal place and have the time and resources to devote to it and even then it can be open to outright failure.

Lastly, a *truly* vegan homestead (with no animal involvement) is not a particularly healthy one as animals and plants can come together to make a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts but from your comments you seem less concerned about the presence of animals, and more about their commodification so this one doesn't really apply to you."

Lots of shots where the only thing moving on screen was the character's mouth and even that was just cycling through a few different positions."

aww,fgcougs,t1_fgclz1d,1580674857.0,Sure.  Dwarf rabbits are absolutely a thing.  I tend to forget about them as most of the rabbits I have hands-on experience with are medium to large.

homestead,fgbzauh,t1_fg889qe,1580667526.0,"When I butcher an animal it's a bittersweet feeling.  On the one side the death of the animal is a loss to the world but on the other I'm making good and complete use of their life to feed myself and my family.  I don't feel bad for the animal and I certainly don't feel as I am doing anything ""wrong"", I just feel like any loss should respected.  I feel very similarly cutting down a tree.  

The overall experience of working with animals is a total joy.  Knowing I have control over where my food comes from and what goes into it is also a joy.  I happen to know u/goldenchicks feels the same way.  It's one of the most rewarding things I have ever done and I sleep very well at night, even on slaughter days.

And before you think I am desensitized or was raised in this lifestyle - I slaughtered my first animal ever in my 30's after a mostly urban upbringing and zero background on a farm or even hunting.  My wife and I discovered homesteading relatively late in life and absolutely fell in love with it."

What's really amazing is how large the pet rabbit accessories industry is.  That'll include feed, cages, toys, and the like.  IIRC it is at least an order of magnitude larger than the value of the rabbits themselves or their products."
