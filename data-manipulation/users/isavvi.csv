Honestly porn shouldn’t be looked at as something vile, as I applaud the beautiful brave women who fulfill the most sluttiest fantasies for millions to enjoy.

My mother did not want to be a part of such a tradition as she viewed the practice as evil and primitive (go figure) so she severed ties with her family after they pressured her to keep contact for my sake, my grandmother held on for another 21 years despite her declining health because she held such a hope in meeting me.

“How much of what we enjoy is down to the influence of culture or other people, a lot, I think.” 

On the surface that may seem agreeable because happiness and joy are experiences best when shared (the more the merrier) but remember in our formative years we are given an eclectic mix of people who we may connect (platonic or otherwise) with based on commonalities such as visions or values and interests. Familial and social culture influences us to some degree but does no predict what we inherently enjoy. That’s why sometimes people who are the life of parties don’t really feel that way inside.

Speaking to someone is the best thing you can do for yourself as they can give you a professional perspective on  what to focus when developing recreations and passions that you did not develop in your earlier youth.

Would rather have THAT obituary running right now than Kobe’s. Still so sad over all those lives lost, especially those poor girls as I am a mom of 2 who are around that age."
KobeBryant24,ffri1f4,t1_ffrbszd,1580158411.0,"I’ve had consensual rough intercourse with my partner where I landed myself in the hospital the following day. It was so difficult to get a word in and was even kink shamed for it, never once did I mention rape or that I felt threatened but the manner that my delicates were afflicted told them otherwise. 

However being a devils advocate here, I do recall that in that trial the medical examination stated that the the girl was covered in cuts and bruises and that Kobe’s shirt had her blood. All I know after that charges were dropped,a settlement was made and he had to publicly state that it was non consensual. I’m not familiar with the legal circuit, So is settling out of court a non formal conviction?"
Shamanism,ffre78l,t1_ffqv2fd,1580156268.0,"I enjoy cannabis and noticed this trend as well. I don’t care much for dreaming as they tend to be dull/repetitive and unremarkable. If I had to put it in perspective it’s like being the show runner to a public broadcast studio. You know everyone there and the set doesn’t change much at all due to budget restrictions.

I enjoy the dark restful slumber where nothing can reach me. Surprisingly not everyone needs dreams."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ffis9fe,t3_etmyao,1579981433.0,"We have a big belief in my culture that you are what you eat. We take it on a literal spiritual level, where the animal is slaughtered in a quick, silent fashion as to not induce any feeling of fear and pain. We even switch over to another animal if the chosen one even senses it’s death and begins backpedaling. 

I firmly believe industrialized farming has made us more sick and fearful (eventually developing mental illness) over the generations due to this abuse of livestock.

DrugNerds,ffexd3e,t1_ffeccws,1579869306.0,"I am a happy teetotaler (alcohol just never had an appeal even when I got drunk) 

However, cannabis and I have a very close bond, unfortunately no tinctures or edibles work for me so it has to be through combustible methods only. The same goes for my siblings, we had a normal upbringing in our home but alcohol just never became a thing, we just all smoke together instead. So I’m calling moot on this."

BPD,ff84uaq,t3_es5w4t,1579666027.0,"Here to say that this happened to me with someone who I was literally having spiritual tantric meditations and psychedelics with for an entire season. I felt a great passionate bond but he stalled on me out of the blue and since then there’s been zero contact from both sides.

I got away from it all by going to a batting cage and swinging a bat hard and feeling accomplished when making impact with the ball. Very therapeutic, highly recommended. Just physically keep yourself fit and ready, the key is to keep building a momentum with personal accomplishments that you have made out of your own volition and not through someone who you thought the world of. Hope this helps"
BPD,ff83l46,t3_es1owp,1579665071.0,"No shame here but I will admit I feel that very sentiment towards weddings. I laugh back it now but I really did have that “How dare they be so forward with their romantic bliss, what a joke!” Not realizing that I was internalizing a deep trauma from my parents train wreck of a marriage.

Sadly I don’t have an easy answer to give for overcoming this, it takes a tremendous amount of self discovery and courage to be compassionate towards yourself but we are all given the freedom to simply try."
BPD,ff82mar,t3_es2wsa,1579664353.0,"Same, I get headaches from social interactions and engagements because my mind fine tunes to every tiny detail. Sometimes I’ll wear sunglasses the entire time cause I rather be perceived as “buzzed party girl” than an antisocial mess.

BPD,ff80bqa,t3_es4b8r,1579662684.0,"Hey there! I hope you’re feeling better cause there’s a lot of us out there! I used to believe this was weird up until I saw the film Inside Out and then entertained the idea that maybe our body is talking to us. Let’s just say some really eye raising results happened following this discovery and I encourage it to look at it from that perspective. You’re literally responsible for TRILLIONS of cells that took millenniums to perfect into the wonderful sentient creature you know and suffer to be.

But joy is in that discovery. The ability to feel, rationalize and think, but the genius in all this my friend is that we compile all these gifts to bring about the ability to act and thus create (for better or worse) now why can’t our body attempt to communicate with in? 

Focus on the narrative of this dialogue, if it’s promoting you to gain wisdom or be proactive in solving the challenges in your life THAT is your body talking. Pay attention, and take great care."

Not disagreeing with you but there are larger forces at stake here and being the iota of physical energy (in the comparable universe) that you are, there are limitless amount of kinetic energy stored within. Ever wondered where that came from?

If you believe in “magick” then you understand the concept of the veil. The Bible is more than just a Cat in the Hat story, there are levels of hidden wisdom that is locked in its pages and can only be revealed when one has fully integrated all intelligences into alignment."
