UBC,fea94fg,t1_fe52s54,1578945828.0,Thank you.  This kind of feedback is valuable and I'll be sharing it with the others.  I just wish there was a way to rigorously test out different presentations.
UBC,fe3qins,t1_fe0bjrv,1578851906.0,"Yeah this is a debate I've been having with the others actually.  Do you think you might have approached us to talk if it weren't for the masks?  

Last time we did this I was in charge and the people holding the screens were wearing blindfolds instead of masks."
UBC,fdys7w7,t1_fdye8ba,1578783028.0,"You don't seem to realize that the TV screens are not the only ingredient of this event.  The whole time these demonstrations run, there are outreachers nearby that are ready to talk to anyone who expresses interest by stopping and watching.  You can see some of these conversations happening in my video, but yesterday was a relatively slow day.  The whole point of the screens is to start a conversation, and the outreachers are there to continue it.  We've actually toned down the videos we show partially to avoid shocking people (but also because it's more effective to show the best of the best of animal agriculture so we can skip the whole ""humane meat"" conversation)."
UBC,fduaf2b,t1_fdtw72h,1578730353.0,"So any message that makes people uncomfortable should not be delivered?  It doesn't seem like you're in the right place if you really believe that.

The event was organized and run by a UBC student and more than half the participants are students, not that this is relevant: UBC is a public university."

On the other hand, virtually all meat has e. coli in it, because of contact with feces.

vegan,fbfxwaq,t1_fbf2ffw,1576825106.0,"I knew that video was going to go to The Cranky Vegan before I clicked on it.  He thinks pressure campaigns work because he's mistaking consolidation of companies that kill animals for saving animals, and he's ignoring the fact that the total number of animals killed in labs in England kept going up every single year those pressure campaigns operated.  This is exactly what you expect when you try to get companies to stop killing animals while the vast majority of the public keeps demanding that they keep hurting animals.  

To think force will work is to rely on the decency of the people you're fighting against.  Or do you really think we'd do better with violence against industries that rely on violence when they get tired of playing nice with us?  And since you're ignoring demand, remember that the public will not be on your side.  They will be on the side of the ones giving them what they still want.  

The surveys The Cranky Vegan cites to argue that more people aren't going vegan lump in people who go vegan/vegetarian/reducitarian for health reasons, as part of a diet that is supposed to be temporary in the first place.  

And even if that's not true, if, in spite of all the outreach we're doing and connecting people's values with their diets, the total number of vegans wasn't going up, wouldn't it be even worse if we stopped and wasted more time on provably useless pressure campaigns?  That would mean more animals would die.  But what if things went in the other direction?  We actually treat veganism as a moral imperative and all the people wasting their time with thrill-seeking prideful acts of fake activism, they had the kinds of conversations with people that got them to abandon all the unnecessary killing?  

You're right that true animal liberation is going to require a restructure of our social systems, but this can only happen once more people realize the unnecessary killing is wrong."
