Why was the child on fire in the first place?!

Sorry, couldn't resist.

See, there are two ways of looking at this, equally plausible. Either she is a nasty gold digger who is abusing Harry or she is the hero here, supporting Harry as he steps back from his toxic family. And from all available evidence, toxic is a perfect description of the royal family. 

None of us know why or what happened or what was said or what led to all this. All we have is media commentary and quite honestly none of it is helpful. Sadly modern journalism is less about the facts and truth, and more about shrieking hysteria."

Just to get you started. I can keep going if you'd like?"
AmItheAsshole,fe6io2g,t1_fe68vg0,1578892121.0,Yikes.
raisedbynarcissists,fe69jet,t3_enpe96,1578884794.0,"Yup. 3 years and counting in therapy, at 38 years old. It feels sometimes like I'm too old to change but i keep at it because i don't want to be this insecure and emotionally needy or continue to hate myself forever. I want to be in a place where i feel good to be me but good grief it's tough going at times."

weed,fe3yrha,t3_enotr5,1578854082.0,"Gah. This exactly. And the other one is:

Scotland,fe3x3q1,t1_fe3lybt,1578853634.0,"It's so weird. People like you expect the yes side to respect the result of the referendum while your leaders do anything but. Remind me, how did The Vow go, again?

Also, there was a clause in the political agreements about 'material change'. Specifically, regarding continued membership or otherwise of the EU. Brexit has been decided, ergo material change right there. So no. No this absolutely is not a done deal. Where are you getting your information from?"
conspiracy,fe3vafj,t1_fe3t1vx,1578853187.0,Yep. Follow the money. Always follow the money.
