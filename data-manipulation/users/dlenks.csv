We're really enjoying the show.  It for sure has Dexter vibes and it's very good.  Joe is such a crazy character but absolutely is an idiot sometimes and will certainly lead to his downfall.  I also love how he basically made Paco a killer in training.  I wonder if that comes back down the road somehow.
