BeAmazed,ffsybco,t3_euxblk,1580197608.0,"I had a friend in college with one of these, except behind his door was a weed garden. The greatest irony being he lived across the street from a state trooper. Dude had balls and great weed."

funny,ffstar3,t1_ffst36o,1580191671.0,That weirdly rhymes perfectly. Damn you! Lol
TwoXChromosomes,ffsjnwi,t1_ffsa8k6,1580183345.0,That’s definitely not even close to a good justification to mutilate women. Women are more than just baby factories! Men are pathetic.
unexpectedhogwarts,ffsjat3,t1_ffs2dm4,1580183083.0,Interesting theory.
funny,ffs26gj,t1_ffs0w7q,1580171303.0,"Well no shit, but we have a big storm coming so I am waiting until after it hits. In the meantime I had fun with it."
unexpectedhogwarts,ffs23np,t1_ffs1y4k,1580171250.0,I was debating that. Maybe the horcruxes can protect him from her?

magnetfishing,ffrv9xf,t1_ffrgbk8,1580166630.0,That seems like way to much to be an accident. Maybe you found a rednecks stash?

funny,ffrthh3,t3_euvxgv,1580165470.0,In my private spot. I didn’t do anything to bring this on. I am friendly with my neighbors. I am guessing it was just some guy dreaming of a bigger penis.
funny,ffrt85s,t1_ffrt1mo,1580165306.0,"Yeah, they drew the balls all weird so I turned them into tennis shoes. Then gave him little gun pouches on his hips, because where else would he put his pistols?"
TwoXChromosomes,ffrosxw,t1_ffroc8a,1580162509.0,That is the scary part!
TwoXChromosomes,ffro21s,t1_ffrnv34,1580162049.0,"Yes, sadly I am aware of all that. It’s disgusting how women are still viewed as property, and second class citizens. It is 2020!! Clearly the human race stopped evolving at a critical point."

TwoXChromosomes,ffrldlp,t3_eunm8j,1580160425.0,"I just do not understand the point of this. Why is a man allowed to orgasm, but the woman can’t? What kind of ignorance creates this kind of thought process? Fuck people. Stay away from my goodies."

AbruptChaos,ffpppqf,t1_ffpb4wy,1580101440.0,"Seriously! I had somebody draw a dick on my car today (unrelated to traffic). I need a camera for next time. Although unrealistic in size, I turned it into a decent cowboy named Pistol Pete. [Pistol Pete](https://imgur.com/gallery/AdGWoti)"
AbruptChaos,ffpp6cm,t1_ffphcwy,1580100952.0,This is a great description.
AbruptChaos,ffo9n3f,t1_ffo45mp,1580075427.0,You speak the truth. I have lived a lot of places and never encountered such bad reckless driving until Dallas. It probably wouldn’t surprise you to know that Texas has the highest insurance rates in the United States.
creepy,ffnuoff,t3_eu6pq9,1580071074.0,"Oh no. My great-grandma got confused like this before she passed. Kept thinking I was my older sister, and asking me about my kids. I have no kids, but I didn’t correct her."
AbruptChaos,ffnewxo,t3_eu88o9,1580065081.0,This is what it’s like to drive in Dallas. They do this constantly with no blinker. It is amazing these people are still alive. Luckily I have a big Jeep so you aren’t squeezing in front of me.
