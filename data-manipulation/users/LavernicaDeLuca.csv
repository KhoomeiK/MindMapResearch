Did you make a profit? Then yes, you need to file and claim the income. If you only sold what you already owned and did not make a profit then you don't need to claim that income. If you sold a little of both and didn't keep track throughout the year, download your sales report from Poshmark for last year. Delete or separate (cut and paste to a separate document/sheet) lines in the spreadsheet that correspond to personal items sold at a loss. This will leave you with all the stuff you sold at a profit.

Jokes aside, here is a source that show that medicare expansion has helped decrease uncompensated costs for hospitals

https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/understanding-medicaid-hospital-payments-and-the-impact-of-recent-policy-changes/

You're right that Medicare pays less than private insurance (never disputed that). They pay around 88-90% of cost ([source](https://www.aha.org/system/files/2018-01/medicaremedicaidunderpmt.pdf)). That's far better than ZERO.

Also, 2 in 3 patients can't afford their hospital bills, even people *with* insurance: https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/26/two-in-three-patients-cant-pay-off-their-hospital-bills.html

Also, approximately the same percentage of people file for bankruptcy citing medical bills as their reasoning: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/11/this-is-the-real-reason-most-americans-file-for-bankruptcy.html

It's a huge problem and bills are not being paid in full, probably not even a small percentage. I think most hospitals would be much happier to get 90% than to get none or to have to spend years chasing someone down and filing lawsuits. How much money do you think a hospital spends on billing departments? Or legal fees for lawsuits? Or debt collectors? Wouldn't being able to cut those expenses out bring costs down?

>doctors are already maximally seeing patients in a given day, more demand wont change much

For family practice doctors? I can get in to see my doctor within a couple days at any given time of the year. They are not booked solid and I'm sure they're not alone. More people with insurance would be a boon to the industry as a whole.

Also, I would love to see healthcare reform include some sort of way to defray costs of medical school (or nursing school and other medical professions). It costs a LOT to become a doctor and I'm sure that keeps some people from even trying. Perhaps if it didn't cost as much to start then there would be more doctors to go around?"

Your cat will be healthier and happier and likely live a much longer life if they are in a healthy weight range. My cat is at least 14 years old and our vet is always amazed at how young and healthy he looks and acts. Plus, his bloodwork is great which is always a relief to see in a senior cat!

First of all, I *highly* recommend checking out [catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/). It is by far the most in depth website about cat nutrition that I've ever found. It's written by a vet and it's clear that she's done her research and she's walked the walk because she's dechonked a few very chonky cats (case studies [#1](https://catinfo.org/feline-obesity-an-epidemic-of-fat-cats/#Molly) and [#2](https://catinfo.org/feline-obesity-an-epidemic-of-fat-cats/#Bennie_)), even dry food addicts.

I definitely recommend getting your cat on wet food if at all possible. Even the cheapest canned food is better than premium dry food if nothing else because of the water content. Cats *need* more water than they will drink on their own (if you cat is drinking a ton of water all of the sudden, get bloodwork, sadly it's a sign of several diseases). A water fountain does help cats drink more but often they still need more. Protein content is usually far higher in wet food versus dry. Cats are obligate carnivores (they *must* eat meat to survive) so they need a lot of meat and protein in their diet. There are some medical exceptions to needing a lot of protein but your vet would definitely let you know if that was the case for your cat.

Since you mention that yours is a dry food addict, I'd read through this: https://catinfo.org/#Transitioning_Dry_Food_Addicts_to_Canned_Food_

The problem is that it unfairly punishes schools with poor, special needs, and ESL (English as a second language) students. And a lot of the poorest schools have all 3 heavily represented. 

NCLB allows special needs students to take a special test but only 1% of the school's population can use that test. The rest take the regular test. I did a research paper in college about NCLB and found that approximately 17% of my state is enrolled in special education so that 1% restriction is absolute bullshit IMO.

I **only** get supplies from the website, you can look at my past comments and see that I've encouraged others to do the same. I don't know where you got the idea that I didn't, lol.

What I was getting at is that there are some boxes that *only* come in a flat rate or regional rate option. For example, the large flat rate board game box. It is one of the best boxes for shipping tall boots. There is nothing else that USPS has for free that comes close to that size. If you wanted to use that box on eBay, you'd be paying over $17 in shipping. If you wanted to purchase a similar size box, you'd probably pay $3-4 per box plus whatever your shipping would cost. A pair of boots is usually at least 2-3 pounds by itself so you're looking at $8-10 in postage minimum plus the cost of the box. So you'd probably pay anywhere from $11-17 in shipping. Yes, your buyer would technically be paying the postage but again, eBay charges fees on shipping.

Because you can use flat rate and regional rate packaging without actually using those services. A medium flat rate package costs over $12. With Posh, it's still $6.79. A box the same size would cost $10.73 with Pirate ship using cubic rate.

>While Poshmark's base rate is cheaper for those cubic qualifying packages, keep in mind, if you need to go over 5 pounds, Poshmark's rate is absolutely punishing.

I agree but I think this was negotiated into their contract (by USPS) to offset the lower rate for the under 5 pound packages.

I do agree with you that Posh is probably not the best market for a high volume seller unless you blatantly ignore the bot rules or hire an assistant. But for a smaller seller, it's the best market for clothing at the moment, in my opinion. I've sold on a lot of markets over the years (eBay, Etsy, Mercari, Yerdle, Listia, FB marketplace, etc) and Posh is my favorite thus far.

poshmark,fcypjgc,t1_fcylrvf,1578084474.0,"Fees on eBay aren't much cheaper. Don't forget that eBay charges fees on the shipping too. So for a $20 item with $6.95 shipping, you'd pay $2.70 in eBay fees which is 13.5% then another $1.08 for PayPal (5.4%) so a total of 18.9%. eBay managed payments aren't much different as far as fees go. For the $20 item, you'll get around $16.33 with eBay managed payments, $16.23 with PayPal or if it had sold on Poshmark, $16.

With Poshmark, a buyer has 3 days to open a case. After that, the money is yours and you don't have to worry about a case being opened. With eBay, you get your money right away but a buyer can open a case up to 30 days after it's delivered. If they use PayPal, they have a whopping 6 months to open a case.

I'm more than willing to pay an extra percent or two for Posh if it means I am not going to have to deal with a case 6 months from now.

Also, Posh steps in on cases immediately. You don't have to answer endless messages from an angry buyer that end with them opening a case anyway. They open a case right away, you both get a chance to respond and then Posh makes a decision. Sure, it may not always end in your favor (or the way that we think it should) but it definitely takes a lot of the pressure off a seller IMO.

And finally, the shipping situation. With Poshmark, you have 5 pounds to work with before you have to pay any additional costs. With eBay, you have at most a pound of leeway (unless your item fits in a flat rate mailer) before you have to pay more if you didn't weigh properly before listing. You also have a wide array of free packaging you can use with Poshmark and a killer discount that eBay will never be able to touch. $6.95 to ship 5 pounds anywhere in the US is an insanely good price.

You're right about the PayPal thing (I forget that they're 2 different companies now but the vast majority of sellers use PayPal so you will pay a ""fee"" if you have to do a return if you use PayPal). Also eBay *does* charge fees if you get too many returns but it's sort of complicated how it works.

I believe that lowers your search rankings per eBay's algorithm. They really push returns and free shipping there. IMO eBay is one of the *worst* platforms to sell on if you want to be treated fairly, especially as a small seller. They don't care about small sellers, they only want the big dogs."

*Switching out of devil's advocate mode:* I agree that it sucks though. I'm rethinking my stance on including measurements. It's frustrating because I do believe that measurements improve sales but if they can be used against me later I'm not sure if it's worth it. I have never had anyone attempt to return for fit though, I've had 2 returns in a year (out of 446 sales) and both were definitely justified on the part of the buyer.

Pros include not having to worry about getting pregnant before getting married, no worries about STDs, and we never had to have any awkward conversations about who we had been with in the past.
