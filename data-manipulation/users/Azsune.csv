classicwow,ffewq0p,t1_ffeb78y,1579868649.0,"What would be worse is us assigning it to someone who seems to deserve it then they don't ever farm the bars or put in effort. If someone is willing to put in the effort for a legendary before someone else it is theirs. This pretty much stopped the guild drama of the third bindings as now it comes down to who ever is putting in the effort and who plays more. 

We were having a lot of people fighting over who should get it and 3/4 of them were probably expecting the guild to fund it as the ones complaining the most raid log and have no gold. Now that it was been said the guild is not funding anything past first two no one has asked about it. It isn't even that bad I almost have enough gold to buy the arcanite, but it's not going to casters."
classicwow,ffcvmi1,t1_ffcuh8q,1579808196.0,Correct we tried it after it first got known and never found a Glaive before it got fixed.  I didn't remember the exact method as it was years ago and I was never on early enough to do it.

I don't mind coding in free form RPG as it is very C like and easy to read. Fixed format RPG though needs to die."
ChoosingBeggars,ffbyfso,t1_ffbxja7,1579786748.0,"The poverty line for Ontario is about $20,000 a year. Working 40 hours a week at minimum wage gets you close to $30,000 a year. So yes this is well below the poverty line at about $5,400 a year salary and if your still with them and they bump you up to $8,100 a year. This not including the cost of vegan organic food which is already over priced."

MaliciousCompliance,fencc8n,t3_eoetrz,1579281647.0,"Reminds me of when Jehovah Witness built a church down the street from me. They bought a plot of land with some really old tall trees on it with the stipulation they could not remove any trees above said height. They ended up cutting down 2 trees to make a driveway before construction began and my father called up bylaw to inform them of this. A few days later it was in our local paper that they were fined $50,000 for removing the trees.

They ended up protesting that they needed to remove more trees for their building plans for the church which got denied. So it was built on an angle in the end and there parking lot is a mess with trees all over it and curbs around each tree. 

After it was built they soon started to send people into the neighbourhood to recruit into their cult. My father each time invited them in and would sit them down and said since you have come to me to preach your religion you must let me preach mine first as its only polite. Each time telling them about a different religion till they would leave never giving them a chance to preach. They eventually stopped coming though."
entitledparents,fejtdha,t1_feikbba,1579185381.0,Depends where you are also. Here it is illegal to work for free. Getting tips does not count as a wage but does go towards income tax. Baggers are rare here only one store around me has them as the store has to at least pay them minimum wage.
todayilearned,fejqcr1,t1_fei8rlw,1579183165.0,"My father won $100000 on encore and I went with him to the OLG headquarters in Toronto. It's a whole day affair. First they make you fill out paperwork on the main level which pretty much says you waive all your rights.  Only way you can get out of it is your in witness protection or have people after you. Then after waiting for ages in a back room with free coffee and tea they move you upstairs to another waiting room with other winners. They offer some snacks like bear claws, fruit by the foot and those individually wrapped cookies with tea and coffee. Eventually they interview you asking tons of questions like where you bought the ticket, where was it scanned, have you ever won a big prize before($5000 and up) and were you ever part of a lottery group and is this a stolen ticket from them. Then they move onto the interview which they send to news agencies and take a picture with a giant cheque that they just put a sticker of the lottery you won on which you get to keep. 

I spent 10 hours there waiting for them to do everything and was so damn hungry. If you ever win make sure you pack a lunch or snacks. They also had Christmas movies on that repeated I was there so long. I was sitting under the TV so I couldn't see it but I was probably the only person that could hear it.

They plaster a picture of you for anything over $5000 and your name on their website under winners and your location. This is to protect from ticket theft and not for your safety."

Remember things thought impossible now can be proven possible in the future.
PersonalFinanceCanada,fdqrwm5,t1_fdqojht,1578673567.0,I am talking about the data that they already have from previous years. We have no idea what the policy was before as now it is obvious that they will have the ability to access the data whenever. Which means they may not have access to the old encrypted data till you log in.
PersonalFinanceCanada,fdqapjj,t1_fdpm16j,1578661371.0,"Yes but the data is useless to them while encrypted. It depends on how they are encrypting your data. They could for say be using your password as salt for the encryption and storing your password as a hash so their is no possible way for them really gain access to the data. Or they could just have it encrypted and just decrypt it when you enter your password in.

I don't know what process they use for encrypting our data but there are ways to make it so only we can decrypt it for them **if** they are doing it this way."

The train system going in and out has been built up well if you want to work in the downtown core and live in the suburbs but any other part of the city you need a car or to live nearby. 

The old city planners even envisioned a sprawling subway system and built things like the viaduct with a lower level for a subway long before it was ever planned to have one. But like what always happens if your city doesn't need it now they almost never build for the future. It got delayed and now it costs a lot more than it did before.

PersonalFinanceCanada,fcu0vj4,t1_fct67pr,1577968698.0,"If you read the first sentence in the overview it says in any workplace where tips are received. McDonalds has a corporate rule that tips are not allowed, thus making it a workplace where tips are not received. The policy is to count any extra money as an over payment and put it in the till.

I had many friends work at McDonalds and were surprised to learn that Tim Horton's allowed tips. Every store had different ways of handling it we split the tips with everyone who wasn't a manager at the end of each shift. But before this the management collected the money and distributed it bi-weekly and it got smaller and smaller over time. Turns out they were stealing our tips and got fired for it."

They would not remove it from another account without the consent of the account owner... I did not know any of the details other than the credit card number with my name on it. It got to the point where I said fine I will just put a stop payment on Netflix then they fixed the problem by removing the credit card.

ChoosingBeggars,fcuk1k3,t1_fcuiqwg,1577982771.0,The post I replied to said up to 50 hours in the UK....
ChoosingBeggars,fcu1xfu,t1_fctwpr2,1577969872.0,Damn you can waive your rights in the UK? Here in Canada you can only do that if you get reasonable compensation. Something like this would go to court and be found in the workers favour no matter what they signed here.
PersonalFinanceCanada,fcu0vj4,t1_fct67pr,1577968698.0,"If you read the first sentence in the overview it says in any workplace where tips are received. McDonalds has a corporate rule that tips are not allowed, thus making it a workplace where tips are not received. The policy is to count any extra money as an over payment and put it in the till.

I had many friends work at McDonalds and were surprised to learn that Tim Horton's allowed tips. Every store had different ways of handling it we split the tips with everyone who wasn't a manager at the end of each shift. But before this the management collected the money and distributed it bi-weekly and it got smaller and smaller over time. Turns out they were stealing our tips and got fired for it."
funny,fcnzvbz,t1_fcnykhc,1577821560.0,I spent an hour on the phone with Netflix because my credit card was on another account that was created by another account without ever asking me if I wanted to create a Netflix account. They would not remove it from another account without the consent of the account owner... I did not know any of the details other than the credit card number with my name on it. It got to the point where I said fine I will just put a stop payment on Netflix then they fixed the problem by removing the credit card.

news,fcn2z1n,t1_fcmv0l1,1577801817.0,"I remember when it was first on the news. They had reported that men with guns had been seen running from the building before the police arrived. Then later changed it to off duty cops. After that they didn't mention anything about armed men running from the building before the cops arrived and stated the shooter is dead.

The people I was watching the news with were like wait WTF? is some cover up happening?"
ChoosingBeggars,fcn1lsc,t1_fcmzkvj,1577800656.0,"I've worked in call centres. A lot of these people are trying to get a reaction out of you so they can get something in return for the ""Bad Service"". Being overly polite and talking as if your smiling is the best way to piss off these kind of calls. I've seen a lot of people get fired over taking the bait and letting the rage out."
Monitors,fc49418,t1_fc43aya,1577409971.0,I've had problems with DP cables.  The one that came with my monitor wouldn't go to 144 without problems bought a new one and it worked. I've seen others have problems with cheap cables on here as well.
Soundbars,fc1o6s1,t1_fbzuxs0,1577324544.0,It seems to be like a static buildup if I unplug it for 1 min it goes away for a week. I rearranged the cords and made it so no other power cord crossed or touched its and hasn't come back.
AskReddit,fanzn5e,t1_falvnwx,1576254218.0,"In my area Toronto starting pay fresh out of school is about 40k-60k depending on job and company. The low end is a bit less common while I was looking and most of it was at 50k. 

I have only been doing software development for two and a half years and I know I won't be getting a raise at this company and I love working with the people here. My boss is the best boss I've ever had very laid back and doesn't care what we do as long as our jobs done. I want to stay but the company itself is a bit shitty with its employees and would prefer to keep peoples wages down and train fresh graduates when people quit for raises. My IT department is a revolving door people come here get 1 year and find a better job."
