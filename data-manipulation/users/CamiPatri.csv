DebateAnAtheist,ffj6bll,t1_ffj64ey,1579991500.0,"I didn’t mean just eating kosher made for a better world but that mitzvot in general do such as not killing, stealing or lying."
DebateAnAtheist,ffj5bsf,t1_ffj55ec,1579990786.0,"I don’t know why Muslims do it so I can’t comment but for many people mitzvot are cultural, some people don’t attempt to do mitzvot at all, but there are people who do them because there is a spiritual significance as well. for the most part we do them because we believe that following them will make for a better world"
DebateAnAtheist,ffj4wyj,t1_ffj4m6h,1579990484.0,It’s a mitzvah because there are 613 Mitzvot outlined in the Torah and kashrut is one of them. It’s something that has become meaningful to people and makes them think carefully about the food they put in their bodies. Most people who keep kosher do so because it connects them to their ancestors and community that also eat the same diet. It’s like asking why any culture does what it does. We do it because it’s the thing that we do.
DebateAnAtheist,ffj44c2,t1_ffj3we7,1579989900.0,"The packaging doesn’t need the symbol though. It’s just an easy way for people to know of food is kosher without reading all the ingredients every single time. No one said anything happened if you eat a non kosher food. No one said anyone gets sick, or is morally bad or whatever. It’s just the Jewish diet that we choose and it is a mitzvah to eat kosher"
DebateAnAtheist,ffj3mh4,t1_ffj3c9u,1579989542.0,I understand your point but at the same time the Rabbi is needed mainly to insure that it is kosher and that the guidelines are being followed. The blessing is not what makes it kosher. I could eat food that falls in the guidelines of kosher without a rabbi to bless it and it is still kosher
DebateAnAtheist,ffj08ga,t1_ffiydee,1579987108.0,"This is completely untrue. Kosher does not mean a rabbi blessed it. Kosher is the restriction of certain foods, the slaughtering process of meats, and a dietary way of life for the Jewish people"
DebateReligion,ffhy2y8,t1_ffh6wz6,1579958863.0,I would say it’s wrong no matter what but for one reason or another still happens. But it’s difficult because there are times when G-d has supported the Jewish people in war and that is contradictory
DebateReligion,ffhy05n,t1_ffh3fzv,1579958781.0,I’m afraid this is a question I’m unable to answer
DebateReligion,ffgbg1l,t1_ffgalne,1579902551.0,Might I also add that I think this is why I think it’s pointless to debate religion in this format. You think that religious philosophers haven’t been asking these same questions for thousands of years. Religion is this very conversation. If you think religions are the enemy or the culprit in this type of debate. Think again
DebateReligion,ffgaz7h,t1_ffgalne,1579902265.0,"I don’t think people act like it’s not a problem though. It’s a struggle of the powerful vs the people. We certainly can’t overthrow the gov’t, the Amazons or Googles, etc. And we can’t speedily solve these issues which have existed in our society since BCE. The question your asking is beyond religion. It’s a question of the human condition which is a question and conversation that many religious groups including Judaism have been having for thousands of years. We hope and aspire for a better world by first acknowledging the state it’s in in the first place"
DebateReligion,ffga0mm,t1_ffg9dn7,1579901677.0,I never claimed that the Jewish community was free of wrong doing. We are all guilty of wrong doing regardless if we are religious or a-religious which I guess is my point. Just because people practice religion doesn’t mean that religion provides them an avenue against committing evil at all nor does it exempt them from the consequences that come from those wrong doings. We can acknowledge that those wrong things are being done and that they are not okay but we can’t stop evil from happening. If you want to talk about Zionism that’s a different topic but to assert that religion is meant to help us live an offense free life or that it would even be successful in doing so is absurd. Certainly the world isn’t perfect. We can’t even agree on what peace means...there are many steps that would need to be taken before even mentioning that religious groups can live a life free of harm
Judaism,ffec3bi,t3_et5jjw,1579842701.0,People in Europe are telling you that?
DebateReligion,ffebjp7,t3_et4z65,1579842205.0,As a rep of the Jewish community I genuinely have no idea what you are talking about
Judaism,ffe01q3,t1_ffdzmok,1579833210.0,"I think it would be unnecessary personally to tell him haha but yes there isn’t really the concept of continually asking for petty forgiveness for the bad things you do. Of course G-d forgives and of course we go through Yom Kippur and all of that but it’s just a little different from Christianity. The best way to think about Judaism is it being the culture of the Jewish people. And as with any other culture there is a way to live, eat, speak, dress behave, etc"
Judaism,ffdxron,t3_esvoae,1579831567.0,"Reach out to a rabbi, learn on the internet from some great sources mentioned above, watch some YouTube videos, be careful not to come across “Jews for Jesus” sources though. Consider if Jewish life is for you as being a convert will not be so much about your belief as is with Christianity but will be about your actions and living a life dedicated to doing mitzvot. You will have to consider “Will I live a Jewish life?” And “What does it mean to be a Jew?”"

bipolar,fdzc0ap,t3_en9ybg,1578788619.0,An interesting take on that sentiment is that we tend to think our happiness is ‘fake’ when manic but we never question if our suffering is real when depressed

bipolar,fdz736c,t1_fdylxre,1578787313.0,I think it’s that when we’re manic we want to enjoy the huge rush of dopamine and so we engage in rewarding behaviors that we know will give us that rush such as spending
