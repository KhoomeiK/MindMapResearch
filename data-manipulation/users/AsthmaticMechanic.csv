The margins of victory in those states were razor thin: 0.77% in Wisconsin, 0.72% in Pennsylvania, and 0.23% in Michigan.

Meanwhile, millennial turn out (self reported) was 51% to boomers' 69%.  If millennials matched boomers in participating in the election, there would have been 11 million more votes cast. Considering that 55% of millennials identify as Democrats or Democrat leaning while only 33% identify as Republicans or Republican leaning, it's pretty easy to see 11 million extra votes overcoming those tiny margins.

dataisbeautiful,fdop9qu,t1_fdonbel,1578609829.0,"I'm by no means advocating a flat tax, just demonstrating that for almost all states a flat tax would be less regressive than their current tax systems.

In the Washington example, families in the bottom 80% would all be paying less in tax than under the current system. A lot less. From 57.3% less in the bottom 20% to 17.4% less for families in the 60th-80th percentiles.

It's hard to see how paying less in tax would hurt less well off families or how a family in the top 20% of incomes would suddenly be unable to feed itself if their relatively light tax burden was raised to a point that is still lower than the current burden of the bottom 80%."

>WHY THE TOP QUINTILE IS REPORTED AS
THREE SUBGROUPS

>The best-off twenty percent of Americans are a diverse group, including everyone from
solidly middle-class couples earning $105,000 per year, all the way up to multimillionaire
executives. For this reason, this study reports effective tax rates for three subgroups: the
“Next 15 percent,” or 80th-94th percentile, the “Next 4 percent,” or 95th-99th percentile, and
the “Top 1 percent.”

>The best-off twenty percent of Americans enjoyed more than half of nationwide personal
income in 2015, according to ITEP’s estimates. The best-off 1 percent of taxpayers alone
enjoyed 19 percent of nationwide personal income. (By contrast, the poorest 20 percent
of Americans earned about 3 percent of nationwide income.) This means that incremental
differences in the tax treatment of the best-off taxpayers can have substantial implications
for state tax collections.

>Moreover, many states have rules in place that provide special tax breaks for capital gains
and other income sources that are highly concentrated in the hands of the best-off 1
percent. An analysis showing the impact of a capital gains tax break on families in the top
20 percent of the income distribution would gloss over the substantial differences in how
such a tax break treats taxpayers residing at various points throughout the top 20 percent."

dataisbeautiful,fdnth6m,t1_fdnst5i,1578592503.0,"The chart we're looking at. 

You can see that currently, in all but 5 states (CA, DE, MN, NJ, VT) the bottom 20% pay a higher proportion of their income in state and local taxes than the top 1% do. 

That means, that in all but those states scrapping all current state and local taxes and replacing them with a single flat tax raising the same revenue would decrease the tax burden on the bottom 20% while increasing the tax burden on the top 1%.

Obviously the improvement will be smaller in other states than in Washington because that state's current system is the most regressive by this measure, but all of those 45 states would end up with a less regressive tax system than they currently have."
dataisbeautiful,fdnsl5w,t1_fdnsh5o,1578591991.0,"According to the chart, that would be a good thing in 45 states."
dataisbeautiful,fdns98v,t1_fdnqepl,1578591800.0,"Let's take Washington as an example, because its current system is particularly regressive.

From OP's data source, the bottom 20% pay 17.8% of their income on state and local taxes, while the top 1% pay only 3% of theirs. If the state scrapped all of its current taxes and implemented a simple flat tax on income (with no credits, deductions, rebates, etc.) instead, the tax rate would have be 7.6% to maintain current state tax revenues (i.e. revenue neutral to the state).

So the bottom 20% would go from paying 17.8% of their income to 7.6%, a reduction of 10.2 percentage points or 57.3%. That's pretty huge."

If the sales/property/income tax schemes that currently exists in most states were replaced by a single flat income tax, it would reduce the tax burden on the poor while increasing the tax burden on the wealthy.

Currently in 45 out of 50 states, the top 1% pay a smaller proportion of their income than the bottom 20%. Under a flat tax system that number would drop to zero. It might not be a perfect system, but it's certainly a lot better than what we currently have."
