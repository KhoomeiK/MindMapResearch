tippytaps,fdts03z,t1_fdqft9e,1578721293.0,I love them anyway. Or maybe I love them more because they're so evil...
tippytaps,fdtrw6a,t1_fdqwxd8,1578721242.0,"Come on man, it was a joke about them having a lot of attitude. You don't have to take this so seriously. It was one comment on Reddit. A joke comment. Levity, brightness you know, fun?"
nottheonion,fdoy3iy,t1_fdngz1k,1578615518.0,I didn't say all Mormons. But she has a lot of kids. working and caring for that many kids could be really hard. If her husband made enough money it would honestly be cheaper for them to have her stay home then get child care. How is she going to get a job with no experience that will pay enough to take care of five kids? There's a lot of logistical issues here. You got to think further than just the first thing. Critical thinking skills.
tippytaps,fdoxxv2,t1_fdn8a18,1578615415.0,So how is my comment about training to it it to attack people wrong?
tippytaps,fdoxvzf,t1_fdn1az0,1578615381.0,Thursday local petting zoo type place where I live that has them. It's wild! I've been two times and the first time the horse's bit somebody and the second time they almost ran over a child LOL
nottheonion,fdoxt91,t1_fdmro5s,1578615333.0,people aren't responding to like this because they are Mormon. They're responding like this because they think Mormonism is a dangerous religion that can trap women in bad situations.
tippytaps,fdmvqny,t1_fdmhoqw,1578568061.0,"Miniature horses are really mean, so you wouldn't even need to convince them! Just have the horse attack them"

trashy,fcznu68,t1_fczcd49,1578105315.0,"I didn't say that. AT ALL lol Maybe don't eat an orange when you're on the go out of a gas station? Maybe they could have a banana. Get easier to peel oranges from the grocery store like cuties. I really doubt the oranges that are pre peeled, wrapped in plastic and put into a container are meant for old people at the gas station."

TikTokCringe,fcxljnz,t1_fcw2xe7,1578065853.0,I don't know man.... Sometimes people who do shit like that talk about it openly. This guy got taken down for running a giant child porn website on the dark web and people said he used to always joke he made child porn when they asked what he was doing on his computer all the time. So weird thing to joke about

trashy,fcx4ihk,t1_fcvayqk,1578050872.0,You're the one being racist. You don't know what you're talkin about. You're just posting something false to make China look bad in to make Chinese people look racist when it isn't true. The NBA is huge in China. How could that be if they were SO racist thought they couldn't even look at black people?? Erase your post.
trashy,fcx4gk3,t1_fcvavfa,1578050805.0,"Yeah I work with Chinese people. We talk about black people a lot. I've never had an interaction with one who doesn't like black people, and they are pretty brutally honest so they would say if they didn't. In general most of the Chinese people I've met are curious about black people because they've never really been around them. They always want to ask me about hip hop and stuff lol and they always tell me they think black people are great at basketball. The NBA is incredibly popular in China, almost all of my students say they love basketball."

succulents,fctqgp9,t3_eivpmv,1577954230.0,Can someone give me some care tips? I put a layer of big rocks in the bottom and propped up the bottom leaves with small rocks to keep them dry... Anything else? I live somewhere very humid and have had problems with them being too wet! Should I just not water them at all?
oldpeoplefacebook,fct8zh8,t1_fcsnwf9,1577936081.0,"I've learned that bettering yourself as an adult is pretty rare. I have friends who are just like ""oh but that's the way I am"" as if you turned 30 and then you just stop improving. You can always get better!"
combinedgifs,fcsovlu,t1_fcoxtgv,1577921386.0,"If anybody is downvoting this because he is miss gendering a trans woman, you're actually the ignorant ones this time. Most ladyboys don't want to be called women and consider themselves ladyboys as a gender. There are probably exceptions, but if you call a ladyboy a girl they do correct you in most cases."

trashy,fcmu6vh,t1_fcmr749,1577792456.0,No they're saying the specific laws about revenge porn usually have to do with the internet. He didn't post this on the internet. He posted it at a wedding.
OldSchoolCool,fcmg3se,t1_fcm78ad,1577773963.0,Was one of the top ones Wikipedia? Because it's on his Wikipedia page. I find when I search usually look Wikipedia is the first link! That's where I found the information :) edit: Here ya go :) https://imgur.com/gallery/gnyccA9

It's seen over and over again. But there is good in the world! Little old ladies at church sales and stuff like that. Unfortunately our heroes just suck."
OldSchoolCool,fcjps3t,t1_fcjnmgp,1577698492.0,I don't think people ignore that he failed. His trick to make himself seem like a hero just worked lol
OldSchoolCool,fcjl2y8,t1_fcj79vz,1577692021.0,The story isn't true though. He tried to patent it but it wasn't unique enough to receive a patent. Made up the story about him being a hero. He was well known for being kind of an ass hole.
trashy,fcjiri2,t1_fcg5n1y,1577689182.0,Have you considered maybe I'm responding to the douchebags who are judging those who may also be grieving? There's a lot of ways to be a douchebag :)
trashy,fcjiqol,t1_fcg55wi,1577689156.0,I'm sure you're smart enough to understand that different people react differently to things. The world's a big wide place in grief can be a powerful force.
trashy,fcfgfzg,t1_fcdbwt2,1577629687.0,I think a lot of them may also have been personally affected by suicide. They're grieving.
