todayilearned,ffcr1mu,t1_ffcq9og,1579805479.0,"Bautista’s humour seems more low key. He strikes me as the guy who could tease you and you wouldn’t realize it until a few seconds later and then realize just how funny it was. Drax would deadpan something and the delivery was done so well that it would be hysterical. I don’t think Dwayne Johnson would be able to pull that off. 

DJ seems like a happy and loud guy who likes to laugh and make people laugh. It’s not a bad thing. It can just wear a little thin."

I have a FAR-right “friend” who was going off in the comments about “Justin Castro” and his “best friend Hillary” and how they have conspired to ruin the US and Canada. He’s not joking. He posts this crap ALL THE TIME. 

(I keep him as a friend to remind myself how batshit crazy some people are.)"
todayilearned,ffcl4yu,t1_ffckyf3,1579801778.0,It will be interesting to see if Dave Bautista can pull off something similar.

AskReddit,ff9xgn7,t1_ff9uzjr,1579723621.0,"They don’t even try to hide it. One station for years had “Mandatory Metallica” like every hour or two. They would announce it (“and now Bob’s Mattresses presents Mandatory Metallica!”) and then pick one of 5 songs to play.

Like you say, it’s a fixed number of songs to pick from but still, there’s hundreds (thousands?) of songs to pick from but it’s just the same ones on repeat."

That’s pretty much 7-11 corporate’s reaction as well. There was a blurb in the paper 10 years ago and they were as surprised as everyone else. One of the coldest major cities in Canada and Slurpee sales are consistent even in -40 weather."
canada,ff9qghc,t1_ff953lg,1579718709.0,"It is but it’s mostly “How dare you spend so much on donuts!!”  

The company in question pays over minimum wage, has benefits, product is made and baked fresh and uses local ingredients when possible. They’re $47/dozen for “specialty” donuts and $35/dozen for “regular” donuts. There’s a 10% discount if you order ahead online. (which Justin did)

Yes, it’s a bit pricey but it’s a local company, paying reasonable wages and supports other Canadian industries. Apparently the donuts are amazing. I’m just never in that end of Winnipeg to try them."

AskReddit,ff9gasi,t1_ff9c9ew,1579712393.0,lol My wife had a moment with our son a few weeks back like that. He put Green Day’s Welcome to Paradise on his speaker and then said “I guess you probably don’t like this kind of stuff.”. (She’s been listening to more mellow stuff lately.) My wife started singing along with it and after the shocked look he gave her she told him “I saw this song performed by Green Day when it was brand new.”
AskReddit,ff9au94,t1_ff920qv,1579708761.0,"I was in the same boat. There are a couple of country stations, a few pop stations, 2 office music stations (basically inoffensive pop music for Genx/Millenials), and 3 “Dad Rock” stations in my area. Within those 4 groups, they play the same things over and over again. The “dad rock” stations are the most egregious. Seriously, other bands exist other than AC/DC, Metallica, and the Tragically Hip. 

Then I was convinced by other redditors to check out CBC radio. My eyes (ears??) were ripped open. So much stuff I’ve never heard before. I also now tune into the university radio stations as well. My Apple Music library is growing at an astronomical rate now with all the new songs I’m hearing and loving from all kinds of genres."

Winnipeg,ff97fnq,t1_ff950q6,1579706601.0,"Right. But those are $10 per HALF dozen. ($20 per dozen I guess? I couldn’t find a price.) You’re still comparing different things.

$20(?)/dozen “Dream Donuts” at Tim’s. 
$47/dozen specialty donuts at OH Donuts."
Winnipeg,ff94rmh,t1_ff93r1a,1579704822.0,$35 for regular donuts. $47 for the specialty donuts. It’s on their website. At least compare the same things rather than deliberately obfuscating the truth.
facepalm,ff6xqmj,t1_ff5zrk2,1579637055.0,"My niece was about that age when me, my kids and her were all horsing around in the snow. It had a brief thaw then refroze so there was a thick crust on top you could almost walk on. Whenever one of us would crack through she would immediately point and say “YOU SUCK!!”. I corrected her and told her it wasn’t nice to say that someone sucks. (Her mom used that phrase so I assumed she had picked it up from her and was using it wrong.) She kept doing it and after like the 5th time correcting her (I was starting to get mad and ready to give her some time out time), she walked over, grabbed my leg and pulled up while saying “You suck.”

If a UBI ever becomes a reality I (as a Canadian) do NOT want any sort of precedent established that lets the government dictate how it’s spent. If a person on welfare makes mistakes, it’s on them. At least they have the freedom to do so. As soon as you start adding more layers of rules about what that money can be spent on, it just creates untold amounts of paperwork that requires more civil servants and more money spent on the program. I’ll wager that the ones that misuse the money are in the tiny minority and wouldn’t be worth the expense and hassle of dictating where/how everyone should spend their money."
