Anecdotally ladies could tell you how it seemed like their husbands don’t have any problem losing weight while they’re languishing. I’m perfectly aware that in real life CICO is what matters regardless of gender but it’s a joooooooooke. Sometimes jokes aren’t 100% scientifically accurate, believe it or not."
fatlogic,ffchzll,t1_ffbzgki,1579799870.0,This sub does NOT understand humor unless it’s fat jokes so don’t even bother.
fatlogic,ffad4p3,t3_eshfgz,1579732732.0,"This seems like a real clickbait headline. I’m a plus sized woman attracted to big men and I know I’m not the only one. This seems like it’s just to get people mad for no reason. Overweight dudes don’t want fat chicks either, where’s that headline?"
fatlogic,ff9asya,t1_ff90i6x,1579708739.0,Can I get a Hell Yeah?
fatlogic,ff8rdeh,t1_ff89xx5,1579693005.0,"This is similar to when a doctor once asked me to find anything linking fetal ultrasounds with autism. If 25 articles say there is no link but Mom Blog dot Facebook says there is, I’m sending the majority evidence.

I think you’ll also find any HAES doctor has already made up their mind that they’re going against established medical advice and won’t ask me to search for anything! Because they know I’ll find overwhelming evidence of the opposite."
fatlogic,ff7voji,t1_ff7afzj,1579659461.0,Airplane seats too. Man you’re flying on the regular???
fatlogic,ff7qehg,t3_es2fu7,1579655828.0,"As a medical librarian, that “provide me evidence based medicine” part cracked me up. I’d love if one of my doctors asked me to pull articles about the dangers of obesity. Or how sustained weight loss is possible. Easiest project ever."
fatlogic,ff7c6hb,t1_ff72jjt,1579646126.0,Blessed be!
fatlogic,ff79zvy,t3_erzmcu,1579644240.0,"In FA Land, the only virtuous way to lose weight is to pretend you’re changing your habits for reasons other than weight. Losing weight can just a  possible neutral outcome that you’re not allowed to feel good about. Eat shit. Losing weight is one of the hardest things I’ve ever done and I appreciate anybody recognizing the hard work. If you don’t like it, I don’t give a shit."
fatlogic,fekhqwx,t3_epekuo,1579200295.0,Shit I’m glad my therapist stuck with me. I started an FA and now I’m actively losing weight. Turns out eating was a coping mechanism for my unmanaged anxiety and I am a food addict. It took like 3 years to talk me out of it though!
fatlogic,fejh34c,t1_feiyumf,1579173935.0,"Spin you’re standing up and riding, which is a little different. My legs are KILLING ME"
fatlogic,fei08gu,t3_ep6w3m,1579127470.0,"This is interesting because I’m 300 lbs and just started to do spin. I can do SOME of the things but not all of the things and that’s fine. I’ll get better as time goes on. I don’t expect the class to go slower for me. The challenge for me is to be able to work my way up to the pace of the class.

I can understand why people feel bad about not keeping up. You assume everyone is feeling pity for the fat slob who is struggling to do anything. But that’s all in my head."
fatlogic,fegt751,t1_fegh6vp,1579101978.0,"It’s just like, in my case, I am a food addict. I ate beyond satiation because it felt good. And it’s made by food scientists to make me want more. It’s like watching people say, “I don’t understand how people can become addicted to opiates. Don’t they know it’s bad for your health? I would NEVER abuse my body like that!”

Like good on you but you’re dunking on people who have SERIOUS PROBLEMS, so I hope your ego is being stroked right by everybody else in this sub."
fatlogic,fefntx3,t1_fefnabp,1579060418.0,"Alright I get it now, thank you for explaining."
trees,fefnpe3,t3_eowlqk,1579060329.0,Boof it
fatlogic,fefmm92,t3_eomg76,1579059604.0,"Here’s a meta rant: people who BRAG in the comments. We get it, you have the perfect diet, you work out, you take care of yourself, people want to have sex with you. You’re not like THOSE people. YOU JUST DONT UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE COULD BE FAT"
fatlogic,fefmbwj,t1_fefm903,1579059414.0,I read the whole thing and I fail to see how it’s related to fat trainers
fatlogic,fefm0ct,t1_fefb0kb,1579059204.0,More people prefer to have sex with thin people? What does that have to do with anything?
fatlogic,feflv8u,t1_fefaw2m,1579059111.0,Do you really?
fatlogic,fedspxk,t1_fedslmy,1579019080.0,I don’t think I’ve gotten more conservative but I think the goalposts keep moving.
fatlogic,feds9tk,t3_eomg76,1579018804.0,Why is being a liberal and being anti-Fat Acceptance mutually exclusive? Whenever I watch an anti-FA video on YouTube it always automatically starts playing some right wing horseshit. You can be liberal and believe in medical science too!!!
BBW,fdtd1hv,t3_en1kts,1578715022.0,No eyebrows?
trees,fdtavlz,t3_en26d2,1578714191.0,I smoke with my mom! Then again I’m 34.
GoneMildPlus,fdsxq51,t3_en13ah,1578709314.0,I want to touch the booty
fatlogic,fdslopa,t1_fdshgv8,1578704808.0,Exactly. All Lizzo did in this situation was be fat and exist. This explosion of fat logic is not her fault.
fatlogic,fdslhgf,t3_emyyf6,1578704724.0,THANK YOU! Some variety please!
WrestleWithThePackage,fds9dvz,t3_emy6i6,1578697372.0,He is seriously so hot. Also seems like a very nice guy!
Michigents,fds8w3n,t1_fds5cjo,1578697020.0,I figured they’d have an extremely low supply.
RagenChastain,fdpbx77,t1_fdoq3wh,1578624779.0,Does anybody else wonder what the fast food and junk food industries think about FAs? They’re good for business but they’re unstable!
fatlogic,fdooaiw,t1_fdomhwk,1578609236.0,The Fat Acceptance movement might not have been as popular back in 2012 but it’s been around for a long time. Look up the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance.
fatlogic,fdn2qp6,t3_em5j5q,1578575540.0,People underestimate all the advances in food science made in the last 30 years. There are chemicals in processed foods that make you want more of them or to override satiety cues.
fatlogic,fdm89rx,t1_fdl2khh,1578542260.0,This is great information based on lived experience! Thank you!
fatlogic,fdm78un,t1_fdm4uv5,1578541518.0,I’m guessing........... Mississippi?
trees,fdiuece,t3_eljde0,1578451258.0,Hell yeah!!!!!! That has to feel great!
Michigents,fdiu4q1,t3_ellggf,1578451087.0,In what scenario would work get files from a dispensary? And why would a dispensary willingly give out that information to your work?
abv,fdipool,t3_eljtim,1578448244.0,I love finding a sub that is very specific to one of my life situations
fatlogic,fdioby2,t1_fdinl53,1578447379.0,"As someone who was a FA for several years, I can tell you that I was sold on the argument that we didn’t OWE being thin to anyone. I have the right to be as fat as I want. And to be honest, it was kind of a fuck you to the world, which felt great because I felt pretty put upon by the world during my formative years.

But as always, doing things out of spite is bad and you’re just hurting yourself and your mental health is shit. I’m glad I went to therapy and I worked myself out of that kind of thinking.

I was an FA AMA!"
fatlogic,fdine4w,t1_fdimyem,1578446783.0,Starvation = feeling hunger for longer than 15 minutes
fatlogic,fdimgob,t3_elk8u0,1578446186.0,So is the fact that doctors and researchers have predictable statistics correlating BMI and different illnesses just a coincidence?
WrestleWithThePackage,fdialyv,t3_ele7vs,1578438741.0,I LOVE Colt.
fatlogic,fdi3wk4,t3_elcpmx,1578435283.0,"Hearing a lot of “starvation mode” type BS in the other weight loss related subs I’m in lately. I assume it’s the new year. I’m too old but if I had the last 20 years to do over again, I’d go to med school to specialize in obesity just to get the facts."
fatlogic,fdht19k,t1_fdhryd3,1578429624.0,"At my highest weight (320) I was biking 8 miles a day, sometimes more. It’s not much compared to triathletes but anyone thinking you can barely walk at 300 lbs must be sheltered."
fatlogic,fdhsq8v,t1_fdhez51,1578429456.0,I’m 300 lbs and very ambulatory.
fatlogic,fdft26s,t3_el4ax1,1578369498.0,I want to know how me skipping a meal benefits the Diet Industry
fatlogic,fdfsmoi,t1_fdeklda,1578369198.0,Damn this is interesting. I’ve been 300 lbs for like 15 years and I’m not even pre-diabetic. I’m pretty metabolically healthy. I just figured by body was used to being fat.
BHMGoneWild,fdfi190,t3_ekdaqc,1578362173.0,I volunteer!
fatlogic,fdebzqt,t3_eky3cu,1578335706.0,Jillian Michaels is such a bad fitness professional and The Biggest Loser is a seriously TERRIBLE program. But I guess she is correct about some things some of the time.
fatlogic,fdcmgej,t1_fdc0ak5,1578278557.0,A lot of the Fat Activists from Gen X got their start in plus fashion. I remember that was the first time I came across the word “deathfat”
StonerCringe,fcsmrud,t3_eif6dj,1577919891.0,It’s true tho
fatlogic,fbi1hak,t1_fbh56b5,1576888086.0,I was big time bullied for being fat growing up. My brain got all shitty because of it and I kept getting fatter and crazier. Working on it now though!
