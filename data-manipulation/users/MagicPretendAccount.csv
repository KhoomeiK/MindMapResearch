Eventually, it goes down to having to make that choice every hour, every day, every week, etc. That's why they say you're always an addict. When you're in a program and consistently make the choice to not follow the program rules, there's nothing that can be done for you. You're just draining resources at that point. To recover, an addict oftentimes has to hit that rock bottom, where the consequences of their addiction become more painful than the act of making that moment by moment choice."

Those moments when you mess up and get corrected are a bit embarrassing, but they're by far the best learning tools you'll find. Stay on Reddit and interact in English. In Germany, try and make friends with Americans. We're loud and annoying, but for the most part, eager to make a stranger a friend. Literally just find an American, ask where he's from, and he will 100% be your friend now. When you're interacting in German, try translating in your head and then double check with Google Translate later if you get stuck on a word.

I wish we didn't need war. But we do. Humans are incredible, but we are destructive, greedy, and evil at our core. As long as that part of us exists, we will occasionally need to rise up and oppose it with violence. American Civil War and WWII are the examples that spring immediately to mind."

cscareerquestions,fexyfti,t1_fex3w3k,1579438303.0,"People simplify. They interview the people with the right buzzwords in their resume that their HR software picks up, and hire the one that scores highest on the test. They don't think things through. 

They should be looking for soft skills. Would you rather have a smart guy with a lot of soft skills, an unrelated degree, a track record of being motivated and capable of learning, but with limited coding experience? Or would you rather have the guy that's practiced common interview questions a lot, got a degree, and has experience connecting a paycheck? I'd rather have the first guy. The second guy is maybe better now, but that first guy is going to be better in a few months. But it takes a LOT more effort to find those people, and sometimes you make the wrong call and get a dud. You have to pay a person to think about every resume and every interview instead of trying to automate the process as much as possible, and take some small risks."

learnprogramming,ferf0wh,t3_eqfhnu,1579353135.0,"Don't try to multi-task. The human brain is not capable of it and you will slow your learning in everything. 

Step 1 is make a plan. For me, I decided to first learn basic html and CSS to get a handle on what writing code is, and develop a foundation. Then I would move on to Python, then to netsec (I will need to repeat step 1 once I get here).

Step 2 is learn the basics. You need a foundation. You dont start racing cars. First you get a handle on shifting, braking, steering, and accelerating. 

Step 3 is apply the basics. Once I got a reasonable handle on html and CSS, I built a website for myself and it was awful. I had to google every other line to remember how to so stuff in the beginning. By the end of my tinkering with the website though, I was googling less and less. 

Step 4  is either dive deeper and get even more familiar, or move on to the next part of your plan. For me, Python. For you, maybe something else. It depends what you want. If your plan's end goal is to be a Python developer, stop at Python and get experienced and skilled with it, adding other languages or skills as needed using steps 1-3."

wholesomememes,femi1u4,t1_femdqmu,1579256641.0,"Think of the 80 million people killed in WWII. That's wiping out the current population of California. Twice. You think none of those people would otherwise have become world class doctors, engineers, researchers, inventors, scientists, etc? We could have learned to split the atom in the pursuit of energy. We could have developed rockets for the purpose of space exploration. Instead we killed 3% of the world's population, traumatized a giant chunk of the rest, set every industry worldwide back 10 years by focusing everything on the war effort, and gave ourselves the new constant threat of nuclear war.

cscareerquestions,femgb5m,t3_epuc6u,1579254014.0,"If you HAD to pick one, networking is the biggest one, I think. Degrees are good to get your foot in the door, but if you're friends with a guy on the hiring committee and he knows you've got the qualities they're looking for, you're going to be ahead of the person with the bachelors before you ever step foot into the interview room. I have a buddy from Navy OCS that I stayed in touch with that's a senior CyberSecurity guy working for a pretty large company. When I was looking to switch careers, I reached out and INSTANTLY got connected to his friends too and got a bunch of free resources and connections. Make friends with everybody and maintain the relationship, even if it's just occasional comments on their facebook posts or posting happy birthday to their wall when you see it. Even if you secretly can't stand the person."

My background is originally in behavioral health primarily working with ODD and Autism, so programming makes sense to me this way. Think of it like describing what you want to an extremely obnoxious child. You can't just say ""go shower"". You need to say

1 Go into the bathroom.

2 Close the bathroom door.

3 Take off your shirt, pants, underwear, and both socks.

4 Place those clothing items on the floor and do not put them back on.

5 Turn on the water in the shower.

6 Step into the shower and remain there.

7 Put soap on the washrag.

8 Run the washrag over the entirety of your body.

9 Place the washrag back.

etc etc etc. I could go on but you get the point. If you skip step 5, this kid is not going to turn on the water. He's just going to stand in the shower stall and run a dry washrag over himself because he's an asshole. If you skip step 1, he's going to close the door to the bathroom and then stand outside it acting confused. If you skip step 9, he's going to eventually step out of the bathroom with a wet, soapy washrag.   


You have to break down what you want into the smallest possible steps, and describe how to do those steps very specifically."

For cost of living, I'll just assume Aberdeen. If you're making 2.5k in Aberdeen, you'd need about 3.3k in Portland, Oregon to maintain your cost of living. If you moved to NYC, that goes way up. If you moved to Tusla, Oklahoma, that goes way down. Take home pay calculators are generally pretty good. Tax codes in the US aren't terribly complicated for people with W-2 income and no dependants. As far as expected expenditure goes, the only major thing I can think of is vehicle. Lease something decent like a Mazda 3 or Camry, max out comprehensive coverage, add gas and you're looking at maybe a grand a month? If you're going from 2.5k to 7.6k, that's probably going to be a no-brainer no matter which way you spin it though.

I know you mentioned COL, but places like NYC and San Fran have cost of living expenses that you wouldn't believe. You'll also almost certainly need a car to drive. Also our healthcare situation is NOT good, as I'm sure you know, so have a plan for if you break an arm or something. If you do the math though, and it all works, yeah go for it. You get an experience in a different culture, extra money, and job experience to add to your resume. It'd be worth doing even for a small loss, imo.

learnprogramming,fejh3l8,t3_ephg48,1579173952.0,"Learn the basics. Good to start with html and CSS for general knowledge. Lots of free courses to work through, get the basics down, then move on. Python or Java are your best bets for language. Start from the beginning. Do a free course or two to get familiar with the language, then move to your app idea. Be organized. Write out your idea and then break it down into smaller and smaller problems, then go tackle those problems one at a time. So if you wanted to make a rock paper scissors game, as a common example, you would break the game down to its component parts. For one, you need the computer to choose randomly between the three options. How do you create the three options? How do you make the computer choose randomly from a list? Google your way through. Trial and error, and eventually you'll have one problem solved and coded. Now move to the next. Eventually you'll have a bunch of barely functional, ugly, unorganized code running a mostly working app, and a lot more knowledge on how to do it better next time."
