nfl,fgwt3o9,t1_fgwagto,1581165540.0,"This was about Tyreek Hill right?  A guy chose football instead of dedicating himself to track.  People here say he couldn’t have made it?  Well his high school time in this Olympic [race](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap3000001101540/Top-100-plays-of-the-2019-season)  would have put him 6th.  

My light googling had Hill’s 200 time in high school only .01 off of Bolt’s.  If he took a different path great chance he would be an Olympic sprinter.  Instead he took the path of beating his girlfriend and football."
nfl,fguwzdh,t1_fgtr4p6,1581131314.0,"So?  Olympic athletes have to put in years of effort for what will be very little benefit.  Being a pro athlete is so much more lucrative if someone could pursue track and field or any pro sport almost no one would pick track.  Far more talented athletes and faster ones pick other sports than trying. To go to the Olympic.  Yes they’re fast or great at what they did, but I guarantee there are others better who pursued other much more lucrative routes."

Top it with sauce, mozzarella, olive oil and whatever else. Throw it on a top rack and that thing will be done in a minute or two.  Really good stuff if you use food ingredients and not cheap shit like bag of grated cheese."
