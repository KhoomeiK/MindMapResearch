DrMartens,feq9i4h,t1_feppw4o,1579339119.0,You‘re correct! They were limited edition like 2 years ago (took me this long to break them in lol). I’ve seen them around on sites like poshmark etc.
DrMartens,feo5dtp,t3_eq5vko,1579295392.0,These are beautiful and Marceline is just awesome!
ThriftStoreHauls,fel0n6q,t1_fekjjtu,1579211520.0,"Pretty sure that since the Doc Martens trend is in full swing in Europe at the moment, lots of people who bought some will find they don’t like them and try to sell them. I’ve also found tons of cool ones and that’s the only explanation I can think of."
VeganChill,feden4p,t1_fedd1bk,1579009415.0,Munich. Need I say more lol
VeganChill,fedels1,t1_fed9rp3,1579009386.0,"I’ve never seen them called that either. Especially because the picture was taken in Munich, one of the most conservative German cities haha. Maybe would’ve expected that in Berlin, but not here."
VeganChill,fed5rng,t1_fed3avr,1579000247.0,"Hell means „light“, as opposed to dark. In this case i think they’re referring to whole wheat vs. white flour. And it’s German."
cats,fcxl3b0,t1_fcxktng,1578065548.0,Thanks! Yeah I just let him chill on my windowsill and look at birds outside while I work.
cats,fcxgjof,t1_fcxft4p,1578062361.0,"I didn’t know that, thank you!"
cats,fcx88ja,t1_fcx7zlt,1578055142.0,"I don’t have any cat treats on hand right now, but I’ll make sure to ask my roommate later. Thanks!"
cats,fcx7xwz,t1_fcx7th7,1578054829.0,"Paper bags are a good idea, I’ve got a few of them lying around. Thanks!"
cats,fcx7wvt,t1_fcx7s84,1578054798.0,I’ve tried to approach him and play with him (a dangly thing with lots of colorful threads) but he isn’t interested lol. Google said to just ignore him and not try to pet him until he approaches me so I’ll just let him explore my room until he approaches me I guess.
AmateurRoomPorn,fcv80ac,t1_fcv7kox,1577996553.0,"I guess the flimsyness is just in the nature of these shelves. The wooden boards on mine are super light and I can’t put heavy items on it, otherwise it’ll just fall off the wall. Finding one that isn’t totally dirt and gross is the best you can do I guess lol. I’ve seen these in various online shops such as Westwing and they do look a lot like the original vintage ones, so maybe you can get a new one. The one I bought was a single item but it still might be worth checking Etsy from time to time. Good luck!"
AmateurRoomPorn,fcv757r,t1_fcv71fs,1577996036.0,"I got it on Etsy. These string shelves are super hard to find, especially if you want them in somewhat decent condition. I paid 70€ for that small thing but I love it so much it was absolutely worth it."
bulletjournal,fcu2fyb,t1_fcty2y6,1577970418.0,It’s so satisfying to look at them at the end of the year when they’re full!
bulletjournal,fcg59et,t3_eh5y3v,1577636600.0,"Absolutely stealing this idea, this is glorious!"
crafts,fbztubu,t3_efbtgl,1577261217.0,"So cute! And can we talk about that tree for a second - that’s the coolest Christmas tree I’ve ever seen, love the ombré lights!"
books,fbs5mkj,t1_fbs54ad,1577050586.0,"I totally feel you on the money being tight. Sadly, my library really isn’t great so I try and buy used books, get them from free little libraries etc. Totally agree with you than reading is the greatest form of free entertainment :)"
