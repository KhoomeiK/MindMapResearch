My intent on using it is because fascism is usually inferring to the act of silencing and denouncing differing opinions and ideals. 
It can be applied to both the left and right for various reasons.

 I do not use the word lightly."
facepalm,fg77x7u,t1_fg77qg2,1580586088.0,I entirely agree. Glad we've found common ground
facepalm,fg77gqq,t1_fg772bn,1580585780.0,"Thanks.
The Best way I can put my argument is: regardless of whether or not something is built on hate, silencing what they have to say is the worse than letting them say hateful things."
facepalm,fg76ywt,t1_fg767n8,1580585451.0,"You call it hate, but that's your opinion. 
My whole point is that you shouldn't invalidate someone's opinion under the circumstance that you don't agree with them.

Not to mention that calling T_D a cult is a dangerous idea because it justifies not listening to an opposing opinion.

Understand that I'm not trying to say T_D is a good place either, it's just a place."
facepalm,fg73jr6,t1_fg72g5p,1580583164.0,"T_D isn't a cult; If anything, it's more of an autistic fanclub.
By calling T_D a cult you make it okay to shut down people you don't agree with. That's silencing differing opinions which is the definition of fascism. 

I also want to point out that the second you saw somebody who had an opinion you didn't agree with, you immediately went through their profile in order to find something you could weaponize against them. 
At least that's what it looked like to me"
