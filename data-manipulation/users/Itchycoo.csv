But there's a solution!!! Every phone I get now, I get a magnetic charger, [like this.](https://www.amazon.com/UGI-Magnetic-Charging-Braided-Compatible/dp/B07NZP77Z5/ref=asc_df_B07NZP77Z5/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=385179140364&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10464853146905269580&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9028719&hvtargid=pla-851996297501&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=82240853201&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=385179140364&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10464853146905269580&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9028719&hvtargid=pla-851996297501) It comes with a little nib that fits into your phone's charging port, and then a cord that plugs into the wall and magnetizes to the nib.

That way, you can plug and unplug your phone from the charger without ever having to remove the nib from the port, thus significantly reducing or completely eliminating wear and tear and damage. Perfect charging ability forever! No wiggling around the cord for 10 minutes until you get a connection or propping your phone up in crazy positions just to get it to charge. It's significantly increased the lifespan of my phones, since the charging port was usually what broke first. and when you can't charge your phone anymore... It's pretty much game over.

Of course, this might not work if your Port is already damaged. However, I was able to use this method successfully on an already damaged port before. It depends on how severe the damage is and how well the charging nib happens to fit in. It's worth a try though, and you can always reuse the charger on other phones if it doesn't save your damaged one."

Sorry it sounds like you had a rough childhood, too. I really feel like I missed out on so much because I was always in trouble for something stupid and even when I wasn't I was hardly allowed to go out and do anything. It's hard to make friends enjoy being a kid when you're not allowed to do just about anything and you're living in a constant state of fear and guilt.

In my family, the consequences for something like that would NOT have been minor. It would have meant I never got to be on my computer again without parental supervision, ever. It would have meant a full-scale intervention. I wouldn't have a phone ever again until I graduated and moved out of the house. I'd be grounded for everything for months, maybe longer. Literally my entire life would have changed, I would have lost friends, and missed out on every fun kid/teen thing ever. Some kids have to hide that stuff with their life because their life is they know it literally depends on it.

I would say to this kid, if his family can let it go and move on with it, you should consider how blessed you are. Consider how much worse it could be, take a bit of time to get over the embarrassment, and then suck it up, rip off the Band-Aid, and move on with life."

videos,ff5heyd,t1_ff54n9p,1579592991.0,"The spread of pseudoscientific ideas is never harmless, in my opinion. They've managed to spread and have a wider reach and influence in recent years. It spreads nonsense that erodes critical thinking and sows a fundamental distrust in the very core of science.

The religious element definitely comes into play sometimes too.

The way I read it, the person above didn't imply that emotional/illogical thinking was mainly a Trump voter/one party thing, I thought it was an example of how this principal comes into play in a lot of different circumstances. It's human nature, to a degree. However, psudoscientific and conspiratorial beliefs do tend to cluster. Someone who believes one or two is likely to also believe others. So it might not exactly be inaccurate to say a flat earther, Trump supporter, or anti-vacciner is likely to also believe other conspiratorial nonsense."

Documentaries,ff4b2a4,t1_ff440kn,1579559459.0,"Beauty isn't just external. There is no way you are so shallow that you don't realize that fat isn't the end-all be-all to beauty. So going on like you are is incredibly mean-spirited.

You're completely ignoring that beauty is about more than just weight. You can absolutely have and see beauty in features other than your size or figure. At least most people can.

Just like you're ignoring that beauty is a wholly subjective thing. Like more personal and subjective than almost anything else. Some people literally find obese people more attractive than people who are at a healthy weight. Do you really not know that or find that so difficult to believe? It's a fact for God's sake.

People prefer all sorts of different physical traits, and someone that is absolutely gorgeous to one person could be unattractive to someone else. This is basic stuff dude.

And it bears mentioning, once again, that beauty and sexual/physical attraction isn't just based on physical traits. The idea of your personality affecting how attractive you appear to someone isn't a made up thing. It's a real thing. Beauty and attraction is a complex thing. Reducing it down to ""you can't be beautiful if you're fat"" is so extremely shallow and false.

But you've sent your message. You don't find fat people attractive. We get it. In fact, you find them SO unnattractive that you refuse to believe that everyone else in the world doesn't feel exactly the same as you."

Documentaries,ff3tsp9,t1_ff3s16p,1579548692.0,"Sure, shame *can* lead to change. But it's not healthy either way. There are much better, more effective ways to motivate change that don't cause unneeded difficulty and suffering.

Shame, stigma, low self-esteem, and poor body image are some of the *[major reasons why](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-018-1116-5)* many people develop unhealthy habits and become overweight in the first place. And they perpetuate negative cycles that lead people to take *worse* care of themselves, not better. Of course there are exceptions. That doesn't mean we shouldn't promote body positivity.

You don't need both. You can get healthier without shame.
 And it's much better that way.

This idea is very much supported by research, for example (from the link above, which is an opinion article that reviews a ton of relevant evidence from studies): ""The long-term consequences of weight stigma for weight gain, as this experimental and survey work suggests, have also been found in large longitudinal studies of adults and children, wherein self-reported experiences with weight stigma predict future weight gain and risk of having an ‘obese’ BMI, independent of baseline BMI [18,19,20].""

And it also just makes sense from what we know about human psychology (e.g. shame about past alcoholism can increase risk for relapse) And besides, there's just no good reason shame and stigma should be part of the equation if there is any other viable option--and we know there is."

Documentaries,ff3t7zk,t1_ff3r97t,1579548339.0,"Very true. And once you do, it'll be much easier--and more rewarding--to start taking better care of it. Not to mention good self-esteem is just a good thing all around, no matter whether you're fat or skinny or making good choices or making bad choices. Loving and accepting yourself as you are is a healthy thing in its own right, not just as a means to an end!"
Documentaries,ff3eo8e,t1_ff30fl9,1579539536.0,"From what you said it seems like your friend was encouraging you to make unhealthy decisions.

But I think there is way more value than people realize in that kind of body-positive attitude. Fat-positive doesn't at all have to mean (and in many cases doesn't mean) thinking that it's healthy to be fat. Saying ""it's okay to be fat"" is important, because it's important for people to know that who they are *is okay,* even if they're not at their best. Accepting who you are as beautiful and worthwhile is often a first, necessary step toward change. It doesn't mean you can't be better or shouldn't change. But accepting yourself as you are--even if that is morbidly obese-- is absolutely not a bad thing to endorse. It gives you the ability to love yourself and want to be better. Which is the first step to actually bettering yourself. Hating yourself or feeling ashamed of yourself doesn't generally make people want to change."

But how does he attract so many god awful supporters?! That's literally my main gripe with him... Well, not him, but his supporters. It just makes me wonder when you attract those kinds of people."
politics,fdl2cys,t1_fdkxm8g,1578515872.0,"Yes, I support Bernie. But literally, what the fuck does that have to do with anything I said?!

Literally Bernie supporters like you are the worst. Turning every tangential argument into a Bernie loyalty test.

I like Bernie in SPITE of supporters like you, not because of them. For fuck's sake."
politics,fdkwwzw,t1_fdkw7t4,1578512846.0,"How is ignoring a candidate whose policies and perspective you don't like, who you think is not a good choice, digging your head in the sand? That's literally just called forming an opinion about political candidates. I think you need to curb your outrage."
politics,fdkwkqm,t1_fdktlru,1578512644.0,"Maybe I'm seeing exaggerated representation in the media/social media.... But I *regularly* see Bernie supporters bashing Warren supporters and acting like they are crazy for supporting Warren when ""Bernie is the same thing only better!""

I support both Bernie and Warren. But it's hard to deny that the outspoken Bernie supporters are obnoxious and off-putting."
politics,fdkvlso,t1_fdkp7wz,1578512071.0,">Had no cult following

That's actually not true, and probably the reason why the left was so surprised she lost. She has/had a huge cult following. She was a HUGE icon during Clinton's presidency and after, and was an inspiration to many.

I was actually surprised to learn that because I grew up in a conservative state where she was constantly demonized and everyone hated her. That's also why I was not surprised she lost."
politics,fdkv51l,t1_fdkughy,1578511797.0,"I mean you're right. But ignoring him might be the best way to push him out and make room for Dem candidates who are actually living in reality.

Edit: I legitimately don't understand the downvotes. I just don't think ""nothing will fundamentally change"" Biden is a good option for the presidency. Usually those sorts of opinions aren't piled on here. Did I somehow stumble upon the hidden group of die hard Biden supporters on Reddit or something?"

science,fdkp865,t1_fdkizuj,1578508285.0,"Wtf are you on about? Just literally listen to Republican politicians speak. You don't need statistics because the Republican party openly and brazenly rejects any kind of public healthcare as *part of their public political platform.* They frequently attack the very idea of it and try to roll existing programs like Medicare and medicaid back, also on a frequent basis. Why would you need any more evidence than their official, public platform??"

ProRevenge,fdbpw2q,t1_fd811d4,1578260072.0,"Yeah, that's literally called stopping to their level. Whether or not they deserve it, you're still doing something that you've judged to be objectively wrong... That makes you wrong too. It's not zero sum. You can stick up for yourself without stopping to a shitty person's level."
UpliftingNews,fd6joy3,t1_fd5evv8,1578192072.0,"I mean, you're right, but that doesn't make them any less responsible or deserving of blame. We have a right to blame the previous generations for their fuck ups just like future generations will have the right to blame us for ours.

People will always blame previous generations--and have a right to--because the older generations literally created the status quo.

What I don't get as much is the old lobbing such harsh judgment on the young. The young have no say in the circumstances that they inherit, it makes sense when they gripe at the old because they have to grow up and live in a world that they had no say in. The old literally raised the younger generations and have played a huge part in shaping the younger generations lives... yet they continue to bash younger generations and change while being horribly offended when a younger person dates to love any criticism their way."

If you don't want kids, that's your personal choice. No need to spend so much time shitting on other people who do choose to have kids."

But I can't stand the idea of the unnecessary waste bottled water creates either. So, while it's certainly not perfect, I try to save as much plastic as possible by buying those gallon jugs of filtered water. Sometimes they come even bigger than a gallon. Then I use that to fill re-usable water bottles. It's much less wasteful than individual bottles.

Also, I found that I could half-cut the bottled water with tap water without hardly tasting the weird taste at all. That helped me save even more money and plastic.

Just an idea."
