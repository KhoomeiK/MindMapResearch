TalkTherapy,ffh8w5e,t3_etlyeg,1579926481.0,"Only you know if more therapy would help you, but I believe most people could benefit from therapy. Especially if there are still things you want to address. Sometimes when the obvious issue is resolved, deeper work can begin. I know it’s hard to bring up topics sometimes. I force myself to let go of trying to word things the right way and just blurt out a half-formed thought. My therapist is really good at sussing out what I’m trying to say, and we’re able to go so much farther now that I have stopped editing myself."

Dachshund,ff4od0r,t3_erg6ru,1579568516.0,So glad you have each other.
TalkTherapy,ff49p3l,t1_ff387r2,1579558597.0,This needed to be said. My therapist said something very similar. I’m one of those with intense feelings for my therapist. He says it makes sense that someone dying of thirst would want a drink. I don’t want to be shamed for loving him in a non-romantic way. He’s given me something I’ve never had. People don’t need to try to minimize it or make it dirty or shameful.

TalkTherapy,fez8i25,t3_eqwp4v,1579454808.0,"I had the same worries as well. Mine took it great. Said he welcomed my attachment. It made us closer. They are trained for this, which as someone else said is a crucial part of therapy. Go for it!"

TalkTherapy,feotot5,t3_eq73d6,1579305314.0,I’m so happy for you. And I was happy to hear someone express non-romantic love for their T. Some commenters on this sub said I must have a crush on mine because I love him. It isn’t like that at all. He has done great things for me and helped me come so far. But romance? Ew.

BipolarReddit,felk5fb,t3_epq0nl,1579224116.0,"I considered TMS, but my insurance didn’t cover it. My psychiatrist suggested esketamine (Spravato) for treatment-resistant depression, and it has worked miracles."

introvert,fe4v7ek,t3_enqbeh,1578863111.0,"This is true for me. During a meeting I will ponder how I feel about what’s said and whether I have anything to add to the conversation.

TalkTherapy,fdsu87t,t1_fdstq5a,1578708007.0,I don’t want to creep him out or feel that I’m making a romantic declaration. I fear that will make him feel he has to distance himself from me. I couldn’t handle that because I value our connection so much.

relationships,fcxpftj,t3_ejgfdb,1578068381.0,"I agree with previous comments about him being abusive and you should leave him. I want to add that masturbation makes you a better partner, not a worse one. I want a partner who’s in touch with their needs and how their body works.

Distance is a great healer. It will never be gone completely — I still catch myself thinking like a Mormon sometimes — but there will come a day when you can internalize a healthier way of looking at the world."

TalkTherapy,fctewp5,t3_eisxr3,1577941064.0,"I feel this so much. I wish I understood why we get so consumed with therapy and our therapists. Such mixed feelings — I like him so much but feel shame for it. Shame and vulnerability. My feelings for him aren’t sexual or romantic, but they’re powerful nonetheless. Borderline obsessed."
RoastMe,fcta087,t3_eilbwy,1577936898.0,The lack of a comma before “pussies” means you’re calling yourselves pussies. Add grammatically challenged to your flaws.
TalkTherapy,fcstl08,t3_eipbw1,1577924761.0,"You said you don’t think you have depression but then go on to list classic depression symptoms like sleep disturbances and feeling sad. Neither of us is qualified to diagnose you either way, but a good therapist is. You don’t have a good therapist, or at least one who fits with you. Find a new one, and ask good questions during the initial consultation like how they will help you reach your goals, methodology, philosophy. Tell potential therapists what you’re feeling, what you want to accomplish, and ask how they would help you reach your goals. You may have to talk to several before you find one who fits. Please don’t give up on all therapy because of one bad fit. I’ve had good and bad therapists, and the good one changed my life. The bad ones made me feel the way you currently feel. Find a new therapist who’s right for you. The difference is stunning."
