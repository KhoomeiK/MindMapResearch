depression,ffi63uw,t3_etp8pv,1579966085.0,"i remember when i was around your age, the feelings and thoughts were uncontrollable, frankly it sucked.

believe it or not it got better, with time, as i understood myself better. 

i hope you keep pushing forward and discover what you need to keep you moving forward with this life. it probably sounds dumb or cliche or some other crap but i would love to be 14 all over again, provided i had the knowledge i have now, of course. 

i dont know if its helpful to suggest this or not but something i found to be of enourmous value to me was learning hypnosis, hypnotherapy, neural linguistic programming, emotional freedom technique. and probably tons other things. it all boils down to 'belief' and i consider all of those subjects pretty much the same thing, but it allowed me to see patterns in my behaviour and catch myself before i slip too much into depression. plus i had a chance to help many other people.

binaural beats work by placing a frequency in one ear, and a different frequency in the other, the brain somehow mixes it together and you get a third frequency that you can hear - this is the difference of the two frequencies.

if you havent already lookup vk3ye on youtube.

oh you may know this but if you have an am radio receiver, you can use an oscillator like this as a beatfrequency oscillator. bfo. this will allow you to decode cw/sideband using the am receiver. you will need to either run the oscillator at the IF freq of the radio or just offset from signal of interest to get the effect. usually better to offset from the IF as this means you dont need to keep retuning the oscillator when tuning the band.

you could also convert the desired signal down to audio frequencies, using a mixer, the oscillator and rf input, then inject into soundcard on pc and use an SDR program to extract and decode stuff."

you could try out zello app on your phone and check out the network radio channels on there, dont need to be a ham to join in, and can get a feel for the community that way perhaps.

i do have a callsign and years ago wanted to take it to the maximum licence so that i could use homebrew transcievers legally but i could never find a locally available training center for anything above foundation and it was always a faff to communicate or have to wait for replies etc. so i never did. now i dont really care."

i think the best tip i personally can give is be critical in your thinking.

i suspect by your question you already have the right attitude.

the issue as i see it is that everyone today wants to be an online sensation, make it rich, blah blah. thing is game streaming is pretty low hanging fruit so everyone can stream from their xbox or pc which saturates the market heavily.
