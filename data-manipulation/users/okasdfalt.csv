LancerRPG,ffsu9vr,t3_euwsgo,1580192726.0,"A super short version of just the organizations that you can get licenses from:

 Union - gay space luxury bureaucratic socialists that standardize the markets and make sure nobody violates any human rights. They used to be nice but they got sick of being nice, so they became mean and took over a bunch of planets and soiled their image. But then they got sick of being mean and became nice again. Now they pretty much just chill and gently guide civilizations from afar.

SSC - Space Ferrari. Also they sell human genetic material to organizations that wish to populate their colonies. They happen have some common interests with Union but are otherwise pretty neutral with them.

HA - Imperialist colonizers who used to be a part of Union, but formed their own organization because they preferred the mean union over the nice union. ""Definitely didn't"" cause the genocide of the only known intelligent life other than humans. Currently on pretty bad terms with Union. 

HORUS - spooky as fuck shitposters that aren't even really a centralized organization. Nobody knows the motivations behind what they do. Perhaps they send people HORUS licenses in order to advance some secret agenda. Union is scared of HORUS because they don't understand it.

IPSN - An ordinary mining and shipping company except they have to deal with space pirates every once in a while. Generally on good terms with Union because they use IPSN's shipping routes."
LancerRPG,ffst01z,t3_ev01zf,1580191361.0,"But don't get stuck on the morality: all the manufacturers are at least a little bit evil. But if you don't like HORUS in particular, maybe you can skirt around the issue: perhaps another organization got their hands on a couple of the HORUS patterns and is now distributing them conventionally. 

(Saladin is a cool defender, also.)"
