Every major company I’m competing with has in-house certification teams, or have the leverage to get favorable deals with certification agencies. I’m stuck paying a nice premium, simply because I’m a small fella. 

Other companies have near infinite ability to then pressure those third-party agencies (if they don’t already control them by proxy) to give me bad ratings, deny me the seal of quality, etc.

The reputable and well known agencies are going to charge more for me to use their service, because of their brand, and can extort literally any price they want on me- I have to go through them to sell in any meaningful amount. (Oh and by the way, there’s no way in hell that those cert agencies would coalesce into a monopolistic entity just by nature of the service they provide).

Now I have to deal with advertising. Again, because big companies have the weight to throw around, they can twist the arm of the reg agency to sing their praises as lousy as possible. Think the junk food industry pro-sugar lobbying, amplified by 1000x.

Okay, so I’m finally through all that.  But wait a minute, because consumers now have to trust the **company** to not sell them poison food, they’re going to gravitate towards large and well-established name brands, who in their mind must be trustworthy because everyone else trusts them as well, right? So when they see some random brand of juice that I’m selling, probably without all of the premium certification packages that other companies afford, they’re going to pass and opt instead for the safer pick.

2. The question is were the rules incorrectly applied, but what I am saying is that the NFL and it’s refs, by definition, can’t incorrectly apply the rules, because they are the supreme rules authority. The fact is that he did not call a catch, legal or invalid. The contention- what were arguing- is whether calling it a fair catch regardless is an incorrect application of the rules, which it is not. 

To phrase my point differently, imagine you gave someone the final say on whether or not the weather is nice. You have agreed beforehand that you’ll abide whatever that guy says the weather is like. Therefore, he can never call the weather the wrong thing, because you agreed beforehand that he’s going to always call it right."
changemyview,fdel47k,t1_fdbtge0,1578341328.0,"See, that’s different. When you’re talking about enforcement, you’re including common sense ruling, because the final authority on rules enforcement is the referee, and by extension, the NFL itself. The rule was correctly enforced because the NFL has declared it so, and they have final authority on rules. 

In short, did the letter of the rule conflict with what happened? Yeah, clearly, as you correctly point out. However, the rules are not robotic- this is why official review is limited. Officials have the final say in the matter, and if the official recognized an invalid fair catch signal but simply moved out of the way on instinct (likely because he simply didn’t expect the invalid signal), he was right to enforce it after the fact.

Also, although the rule is indeed being debated in football circles, it’s totally irrelevant because the nfl has final say on enforcement. You hope that they consistently enforce the ruling, yes, but the refs and the organization they represent are the last authority.

Tl;dr the rules are what the league says they are, so any interpretation is the correct one."

So- accurate? TECHNICALLY. **But, it intentionally misrepresents the data in order to make a political point.** Some private universities have increased their tuition dramatically, yes. But, this is more because the school just hasn’t grown physically over the years- they can simply afford to charge more. State institutions, almost all of which have automatic admission policies in place for in state students, have not grown in cost in a meaningful matter.

Whoever did the visuals of the trilogy needs a raise- from Kylo’s saber, to the duel in the rain, to just the overall color compositions- absolutely stunning.

However, no matter how I look at it, I hate that they tried to do a trilogy’s worth of story in one movie. The palps storyline? Great idea, interesting premise- for three movies, not one. I’m not sure I can even call this a trilogy- there are ZERO connecting story threads. The characters are the same, and Rey shares a little backstory, but it’s whiplash in everything else. It’s not really a good sign when I could literally just throw out TLJ and replace it with an index card saying “and then Rey trained with Luke and killed snoke along with Kylo” and the characters would be equally developed.

I think it’s cowardly to throw Rose in a closet after pushing her so hard in TLJ- the everyday joe perspective in SW terms is a fascinating one (see: Space Janitors) and she could have, and should have, been given some writing love.

Finally: this needed to be a two-parter. It just did. It’s so blindingly clear that JJ wanted to take this story over a trilogy, and then got shafted by Johnson. Kennedy should be fired over this- it was such a monumental mistake to split the trilogy between directors, going in without a central plan. She took a story that practically writes itself, and managed to alienate SW’s most loyal fans, old and young alike, and create a storyline that’s just... janky. There’s really no other way to describe the experience.
