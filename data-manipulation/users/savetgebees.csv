insanepeoplefacebook,fflvggo,t3_etukp6,1580044627.0,Yes it’s a joke. But I have friends who are paramedics and people do use up resources for stupid crap. Calling an ambulance for a common cold when a cab would have been cheaper. When going to a walk-in clinic would have been cheaper. But they use up an ambulance and ER space.

AskMen,ffi17iv,t1_fffwlie,1579961998.0,I want more easy comedies. Sitcoms.  I LIKE SITCOMS!  Why does everything have to be a deep drama with all these twists and turns and unanswered questions?  I was really hoping Netflix would have a show like monk or psych but nothing that I’ve found yet.
AskMen,ffi0poo,t1_fffyu35,1579961532.0,I stopped watching early on when Dearborn Michigan was having race riots and he called up the Michigan governor (who was doing Muslim curfews). I live in Michigan and was pretty insulted. If they weren’t having race riots after 9/11 why would they after a cabinet bombing that was still being investigated?
AskMen,ffhzhia,t1_ffgjo5n,1579960324.0,Well they did trick us with the baby scene in the Mexican hotel.   I think adoption would have been great. Or maybe adopting an older kid like 9 or 10 so robin can connect with them as more of a guide through life vs mom.
AskMen,ffhyyex,t1_ffhkrwt,1579959781.0,And he treated the mother bad. Couldn’t even marry the girl then goes for a quicky court wedding. He was so selfish planning some extravaganza when she wanted simple so instead of just planning simple he totally dropped the ball  and got married as an afterthought between taking care of babies. It really pushed home the idea that she was just a womb for his kids.

loseit,fffynug,t1_fffrbtk,1579894678.0,That’s not exactly true. Sure you might not lose specific fat in a certain spot. But focusing on muscle building will help smooth out an area. Creating lean muscle.
loseit,fffy68z,t3_ete9t1,1579894372.0,"Focus on building muscle. An easy exercise is stand with your arms stretched out and just start doing small circles keeping your muscles tight, move them up and down like your flying, keep your biceps flexed and move your arms in and out like your hugging someone. Just do different arm movements while flexing your muscles.   Play an upbeat song and just walk around the room moving your arms the entire length of the song.   At first it seems silly but your arms start to hurt and you just have to suck it up until the song ends. I like to do it to Lizzo I’m a bad bitch.   Maybe take advantage of the boring time after painting your nails or watching tv.

loseit,fff1b76,t1_ffdzh8q,1579872957.0,"Well it depends. Are parents cooking healthy foods and keeping fridge stocked with fruit?  Or are they serving lasagna and breadsticks with large glasses of milk. And keeping the pantry stocked with chips and pastries?

Are they going for a walk with op or telling her she needs to go out in January and take a “relaxing” walk around the block.  Depending on location January could mean bitter cold in some parts of the world or sweltering heat with raging wildfires in other parts of the world."
loseit,ffezuwj,t3_et0nzt,1579871695.0,"Are you a snacker or are you a bulk food eater?

Like are you fine with a small plate at dinner but eat snacks whenever you want?  Or are you always going back for second and thirds at meal time. 

Figuring this out will help you get control of your eating. 

My advice is quit drinking any and all sweet drinks, soda and juice. Try to get 36-40oz of water in a day. Ask your mom to buy some fruit flavored caffeine free herbal teas and drink those after dinner.  I like citrus sunrise, black cherry and peach passion. 

Once you can cut out drinking your calories start paying attention to what else you eat. Are you eating more than one candy bar a day?  Mindlessly eating chips right out of the bag?

Are you getting in fruit and veggies. Try incorporating an apple into each of your meals. even if you are not cutting out other foods. Eat the apple first then start on the rest of your meal it will fill you up. 

And make sure you’re eating good filling proteins and fats. Fats sound bad. But if you eat a fried egg and 2 pieces of bacon and feel full until lunch. You’re way further ahead than a bowl of special k cereal and a candy bar at 11am because your starving again."

Well around summer I partially fell off the wagon. I gained back 5 pounds.  But I’ve been maintained the 10lb loss and look pretty good (no arm cellulite or back of leg cellulite)

I have kept up my work out routine the entire year but have not been great with food choices. It’s always on the back of my mind but I’ve found I can easily maintain that 10lb loss with working out."
europe,ffdh1j9,t1_ffd46bl,1579820696.0,I think it’s religious based. Something about being chosen by god and the 2nd coming of Christ.
europe,ffdg6kc,t1_ffc0fta,1579820194.0,I wouldn’t be shocked. My grandma lived to 104 and outlived 3 sons and 1 daughter. And they all lived pretty normal lives. It’s not like they died in bus accidents.

Which I truly believe is a cycle and as soon as the openings are filled, due to the boomer exit, trade jobs won’t be all that easy to come by. 

Both my brothers are in trades. My older brother (construction trade) got in because of who he knew. My younger brother had a heck of a time getting into the electrician trades. Then he got into the lineman’s union and realized it was really hard and scary work."
AskReddit,ffcnnzd,t1_ff99r9x,1579803318.0,"It does suck. Networking is so important. And I think parents that say go meet them and shake their hand are more concerned about improving your motivation to find a job.  Maybe the technical way of applying for a job has changed but motivation and ambition (or lack thereof) is noticed by employers.  Networking has always been key. 

Example: 
My cousin went to school to be a teacher. She really wanted a job in her hometown but was unlucky enough to graduate during the recession and very few teacher openings. But she did nothing other than apply for jobs, she just expected a job to fall in her lap.  Her sister taught at the school district my cousin really wanted, sisters principal said “tell your sister to call me and we can do mock interviews”. Sister never called. 

I told cousin to apply at my work since they only looked for bachelors not a specific degree. Nope wanted to be a teacher, took her 5 years to find a teaching job!!!  5 years working at a minimum wage retail job instead of considering other alternatives. Or even putting the effort into meeting principals in the schools she was interested in. 

Shit, she could have probably made it into the training department at my boring ol’insurance job with its 6% 401k match by that time."
AskReddit,ffcm2p8,t1_ffb657y,1579802340.0,"Most middle class people need money and scholarships. 

You have to apply for a scholarship, they are not searching out people to take their money. So if a poor person isn’t applying for this scholarship, you not accepting it is not going to help them."
AmItheAsshole,ffci7ae,t3_esjhx2,1579800002.0,"NAH. I get it. You don’t even know this kid. But just let her in the photo. 

My aunt babysat me as a kid. They were getting family photos and I was supposed to sit to the side and I just threw a fit until they let me in the photo. For 30 years that family photo hung on their wall with me in it. My cousins had friends ask if they had a younger sibling who died. It’s been a long running family joke....family wedding and my cousins get a family picture they bring me over to get a shot with me."
OldSchoolCool,ffcg3t0,t1_ffc5iu5,1579798714.0,Well it is a retouched photo. They may have taken best guesses on coloring. Looks like he’s got nice bone structure but there could be some coloring/shading that would make him less good looking (eyes and lips). Wish there was a side by side of the black and white.
AskReddit,ffcdomj,t1_ffbxc81,1579797222.0,I don’t know. It just has a weird shopping feel. Not dirty or gross. It’s very well kept. It’s just the stores aren’t great.  I like shopping in birch run. Maybe because of the convenience of driving around and being able to walk into the specific store vs wandering around an indoor outlet mall.
AskReddit,ffbwx2l,t1_ffash4z,1579785443.0,"Now there is nowhere other than Walmart type stores to shop for toys. Online is great and all if you know what you’re looking for. But it’s really hard for kids toys. When my kids were real little like toddler I would take them and if they liked something I would toss it in the cart to buy for Christmas or birthday, their memory was pretty short.  Or they were easily fooled by my winter jacket covering it. 

Even as they got bigger we would go for ideas. Now they are kinda passed toys and are more into electronics but still like a toy to unwrap at Christmas. It’s hard finding something online that they will like and isn’t a piece of shit."

AskReddit,ffbvr43,t1_ffbtqp0,1579784387.0,It’s gone. I think the LEGO land and aquarium are in its spot. For some reason my husband always suggests that mall when we need to do some shopping. I hate it. I’ve always hated it since it was built. I would consider it a step down from an outlet mall.

Like if my parents can stay self sufficient until 80/84 I will be retired and can help run them to the grocery store, dr appt and help keep the house clean ect ect. That doesn’t worry me.

My grandma broke her hip at 96 and lived to 104 mentally fine just needed someone around to help when needed. She had 11 kids that they just took turns staying at her house 1x or 2x a week. They had a calendar and a schedule. If you were planning a vacation you just put it on the calendar. I had 2 aunts who lived out of state and a few times a year they would come and stay a week or two with my grandma and give everyone a break from having to rotate.  My mom said it worked fine for 7 years but the last year got really hard as my grandma was getting weaker and weaker and the older sisters (some 18 years older than my mom) were also getting pretty frail."
AmItheAsshole,ff469w8,t1_ff3xqg5,1579556468.0,"My mom was the same way. She was the youngest of a very large family.  She had nieces and nephews close to her age. I think she figured out as an adult how hard it was for her older siblings and saw it in her older nieces who were taking care of their siblings. 

I babysat plenty but it wasn’t horrible it was more of a treat that we got to rent a movie and eat and drink chips and soda."

I think tacos are more widely appreciated as you can make them however you like. Don’t want meat?  Just fill a tortilla with the vegetables and refried beans or Spanish rice.  Also easy to transport to your room.  The rmh we were at had a child staying there who was going through chemotherapy so they couldn’t come down to eat."

So I felt more comfortable with him taking care of the baby than me!  But I would see some of my friends husbands and think yikes I don’t know if I could leave a tiny baby alone with them.  Babies have a way of forcing people to grow up but I wouldn’t want my baby to be their learning curve.

Kid was having sex at 15 has a new baby and parents are totally fine with leaving a 16 year old home alone for a few days. Of course he had no problem with it, he got the house to himself and didn’t have to deal with the questions and judgement from extended family.

AmItheAsshole,fey3nfx,t1_fess8va,1579440373.0,This is my thought. The kids are 15. I live in the country so I would have had to drive them home or had the parents pick them up. Even when we did live in a more urban setting friends lived too far away to just walk home.  And who just sends a group of girls out on their own to walk home unless they lived on the same street?

My kid is only 12 and I very rarely look at, my husband looks at it daily and is constantly on our kid about zeros but I’ve found the app isn’t real time.

Instagramreality,feghmiw,t1_fefzliw,1579093036.0,"Nah. Imagine everyone facing death feeling and looking like a 25 year old. That would be a tragedy. Aging prepares you for a natural death, not in a suicidal way but in a type of acceptance."
Instagramreality,feghfkp,t1_feg4zje,1579092860.0,"Personally I think it’s energy. Yeah I’m still in my early 40s and I’m not in management. But I worked with a woman who retired at 60 which is a few years early but not crazy early. She seemed way too young to retire, but she was small stature, maintained a healthy weight,  had a classic bob haircut with bangs (not high fashion but not dated either). And most importantly she was energetic and positive. Not energetic that she was bouncing through the room but energetic where she would spend time mentoring and volunteering for projects."
Instagramreality,feggt96,t1_fefx4ik,1579092284.0,But truly beautiful people are usually pretty good looking old people in comparison to other old people. Yeah some people age poorly but if you have the good bone structure that makes people attractive you’re going to be better looking than average at any age.
Instagramreality,feggaz5,t1_feg0tka,1579091799.0,"Yeah no kidding. 30 was by far my best looking year. My oily acne prone skin was finally cleared up yet I wasn’t at the point of fine lines. So I could comfortably go without foundation just a little lipstick and eye make up. 

And I finally had the money to buy quality clothing and make up and spend more on hair stylists.  Damn I miss 30. 

But even at 43 I look damn good. I find it easier to compare myself to other 40 somethings not 20 somethings."

instantkarma,fedbm1q,t1_fed5mb5,1579006761.0,"Recently the police in my city released security footage of a bar fight.  People appeared to be just standing around a high top table having a conversation. One guy turns his head to the left. Guy standing to the right of him just nails him with a sucker punch to the temple. The guy goes down and all you see are his legs. Some guy on the other side of the table tosses his drink on the downed guy. Nobody helps the guy, a woman just walks away from the table. Security and 1 other guy lean down to check on him.  Turns out the guy ended up dying in the hospital and the puncher is on trial for murder. 

I read the news comments and it appears these people were enjoying some bar time with their friends. And the victim had come up and was hassling them. So some dude decided to just sucker punch him and ends up killing him. 

No matter how awful someone is being once you get physical you become the aggressor, if someone gets seriously hurt “they were jerks” is not going to get you out of an assault charge."

Not a huge deal if you have no intention on running for president and just want to do your job."

AmItheAsshole,fe9ukh6,t3_eo6j73,1578941588.0,"YTA. I know 2 families who have adopted. And both of them are extremely grateful for the birth family’s decision to place their child. 

Go with your daughter, be with her when she meets her birth family, experience the culture of her birth country. You can be a jerk and lose your daughter or you can go into this with an open heart and build stronger bonds with your daughter.   She may have some rough experiences meeting her birth family if they are still living in extreme poverty she is going to need you to be there with her. 

And this gives you a chance to meet the woman who gave your daughter life and for you to show that you gave her a home full of love."

Not that we are rich but my ancestors came over bought land to farm and still own that same land today.   The only thing anyone has paid on it for several generations is taxes.  We are not rich, and land ownership isn’t as big a deal in the US. But it does make you think a little about what you do today most likely will have an impact for several generations."
