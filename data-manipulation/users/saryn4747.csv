AskReddit,fgf12dg,t3_exnwsr,1580718713.0,"when I was about 9yo there was a creepy video called ""obedece a la morsa"" going around that really creeped me out. Later I learned that the person in the video was a disabled man that wanted to be a drag queen and made a video dancing, she even appeared in a Marylin Manson music video. edit: the name of the video in english was ObeyDaWalrus, I'm sure most of you have seen it. Also I think she was actually trans, I don't remember well

As a teenager, I saw a video of a child rapist being tortured to death by some people after getting caught assaulting a girl.

Something else I saw as a teen was some bestiality videos, one which really got stuck in my brain was of a woman being forced to have sex with a horse."

A very close friend of mine lost her boyfriend to suicide because they were breaking up, and it wasn't the first time he threatened to end his life so nobody did anything, even his roommate thought he was on a 15hr depression nap on his room. But when my friend went to see him it was too late."

college,fgdmpti,t3_extzxz,1580684144.0,It's useful if you're only taking online classes and an easy grade. But I must say for those professors that make you buy it and then don't count the mathlabs homework and quizzes as grade have a special place in hell
college,fgdme0l,t3_exu4yb,1580684009.0,"I don't think is rude, most (if not all) professors understand not every student has the money to buy books every semester. If you REALLY cannot afford it maybe they can even give you a free access code. I had a friend a couple of semesters ago that was financially struggling and the professor let her have a temporary access code for a month or so, (we were all given that option just to make it fair) until she was able to pay for the full semester code."

AskReddit,fg7z0uo,t3_exagml,1580605141.0,"I forced myself to be sexually attracted to men because I didn't want to be seen as ""the tomboy"" friend or as a lesbian in my group of friends (which consisted of mostly men). Because of this I was raped, and sexually assaulted multiple times. During my teenage years, I lived in a very conservative city in Mexico, so people would really judge you if you didn't fit within the heteronormative way. 

Luckily I found friends that really accepted me the way I am, and now I live with my loving partner in the US."
AskReddit,ffvxknr,t3_ev871i,1580276379.0,"according to my boyfriend (who's russian) I've said the little russian words I know, for example, one morning he was going to work really early and while I was still asleep I went "" khorosho   khorosho ""  (translated to ""okay"") while he was getting ready. Another time he said I called him a ""suka"" followed by ""I love you"" in russian

On a more scary note, I also get sleep paralysis very often and usually I would say stuff like ""what's that?"" or ""who's there?"" in like a really scared voice. Or I would cry out of nowhere, but my boyfriend would give me kisses to calm me down

He's also a sleep talker and would say the most random stuff, like ""did you put it in the oven?"" or would just mumble some random stuff in russian (usually would ask what time is it) One time he stood up out of nowhere and took his phone and said ""hello? ... no I'm sleeping ... ok bye"" and went back to bed"

college,fehq4pg,t3_ep1or8,1579121643.0,"This is what I do not just to eat healthily but also on a budget;

I buy everything I can in bulk, stuff like rice, beans, quinoa, cereal, oats, and some nuts (for snacks). This way I save money.

Keep my red meats to the minimum, maybe once or twice a month. But I keep my animal fats in a good amount by eating fish and/or chicken once a week.

I Pre-make meals, so for example if I make rice, beans and grilled chicken breast one day, I make sure I have enough for the rest of the week, so I buy a pack of 12 chicken breasts.

Where I spend most money is in fruits, so I try to buy stuff that can last more than a week, oranges, bananas, and apples.

And for cravings and snacking, I just get nuts, and dried fruits, which I can also get in bulk. And just drink water all the time. If I don't feel like having just plain water, I drop one lime and make lemon-infused water (lime is stronger and can make the lemon taste last longer).

I also started buying flour in bulk so when I feel like having a pizza I just bake it myself, is cheaper than ordering out and it tastes better ;)

I hope this is helpful

edit: mentioned in another comment and I agree, limit your alcohol intake, especially if you're not eating healthy enough."
TheLastAirbender,fdzwplf,t3_e3g86n,1578797634.0,"When I first watched the series, back when it aired, I was a really big fan of Zutara, but years later when I really thought about it it really would not work out, especially since their relationship did not have time to build up, they barely had the time to go from enemies to friends. 

However, recently I watched The Legend of Korra, and I would've liked for them to find each other in their old age since it is at a point where they no longer have to worry about rebuilding their nation/tribe. I just feel like they are good for each other somehow, maybe not strictly in a romantic sense but in a really close platonic love-friendship way, if that makes sense, like really really close friends, but not brother-sister type."
