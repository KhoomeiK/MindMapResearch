It takes a whole village, not all of those people are going to have their lives in perfect ""order"" (whatever the fuck that means), but that doesnt invalidate their effectiveness in any real way, even if they are ""less"" effective.

I mean, for one, lots of people are going to have lots of different opinions on order. It's a bit hyperbolic but just because dustin doesnt fold and stow his laundry immediately doesnt mean he's not wrong about the importance of healthcare advancements. But susan might think it's utter fucking chaos that Dustin doesnt take care of his laundry and shes an antivaxxer.

KitchenConfidential,ffkavdh,t1_ffiyznr,1580019778.0,">Pay your employees a living wage or fuck off.If you cant stay in business doing that then you dont deserve to be in business.

So since you pay your employees a living wage, dont fuck off? Like I quite literally dont have a problem with you. As I said, ""pay the wage or fuck off"", since you pay the wage then the ""fuck off"" doesnt apply.

You got hyper aggressive really quick there buddy. 

I mean, sure you might have drivers that make more than me, I mean, statistically almost certainly not. I do live very comfortably, where I live, but that definitely wouldnt be enough to live comfortably in other certain parts of the country.

So, ya know, GOOD, I'm glad if those kids are making more money. It's literally not an insult to me. It doesnt detract from my life at all, it's weird that you think that's important.

Furthermore, I dont have a problem with tipping, I tip people that make a full wage already and will continue to for good service. Nothing says we cant still encourage these guys to get tipped. Who wouldnt want to reward people for doing well?

When did I ever say that you didnt pay your employees a living wage? It was quite literally an either/or statement. Again, obviously the ""or"" part didnt apply to you, chill the fuck out.

What do you mean I cant have my own thought? I mean literally all of that is mine insofar as that we all are a little influenced by what we experience and share with each other and through our lives. But generally, yeah, that's how I feel because I've spent a lot of time thinking about it. Again, odd that you just assumed that wasnt the case, to some people that would seem like you're looking for an excuse to be agressive.

Also, yeah, definitely not a ""kid"". But, it's been fun.

Again, pay your employees a living wage or fuckoff.  If you cant do it then you shouldnt be in business."

I mean, Bernies not a socialist, if you think he is then you literally dont know what either socialism means, or what bernies policies are, or both. But theres definitely something that you don't know there.

Secondly, I mean, Ideally, if technology were good enough that quite literally EVERYONE could not work and live a healthy, happy life, then... well fuck yeah, that sounds like the goal, right?

But seriously, SECONDLY, no, why the fuck would there be a correlation between not wanting to work and socialism? I mean, you obviously dont actually know what socliasm means. Absolutely nothing about it means that there isnt labor. Like there is ZERO connection between the two.

So, I mean, whatever the fuck you're getting at, from my perspective, is still completely nonsensical.

I mean seriously, even when a lot of the hardcore conservatives, capitalists, and right wingers say ""liberals/socialists just want free shit"" they are still being hyperbolic. Like they dont quite literally think we want the rest of society to be their slaves. I feel like you have to be really fucking out there to think of americas left wing politics that incorrectly."

Statistically the answer is yes, without a doubt. The end results are that other countries implementing certain social programs (like college and healthcare) are happier, healthier, smarter, and wealthier.

1) Health care costs tend to be drastically lower for a similar or even drastically better level of care. So, I PERSONALLY get better healthcare FOR CHEAPER.

2) But free college, I dont want to go to college? Why should I pay for them? A more educated population makes more money and has lower rates of violence.

 Oh good, now that theres more money everything looks nicer and prettier. Houses and yards get taken care of, more parks get built, neighborhoods look nicer. People get less sick and are less of a burden on our medical system so I can get better care FOR ME. AND I HAVE A LOWER CHANCE OF BEING ASSAULTED?

3) There are a ton of other things to touch on but the final one I wanted to point to was this. I'm happy to pay a little more for everyone to have a better life, partially because it makes MY LIFE better, and partially because I just want other people to have a better chance at happiness."
