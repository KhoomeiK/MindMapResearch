Thanks for the encouragement and advice!"
offmychest,feia0k6,t1_fehva8u,1579133632.0,And thank you!
offmychest,fehz6f1,t1_fehva8u,1579126834.0,"You're exactly right, it does feel good knowing that you're adding value to an organization. 

 I'm a fairly even keeled, non-emotional person, but I've come to realize that I love this company that I work for. I don't love every individual person, but I do love what the company stands for overall.  And totally appreciate how it goes about it's business generally doing good, and being profitable AND highly ethical."

offmychest,fehyim0,t1_fehjkzq,1579126436.0,"Thank you! Yes, would love to take the wife on a long-weekend trip. Definitely going to dinner this weekend - someplace nice. I know the imposter syndrome will fade ... it just hard to believe it happened, even though I definitely wanted it."
offmychest,fehycnq,t1_fehmfcj,1579126336.0,"There's a lot of good advice right here in this thread. One thing I'd add, which I basically picked up from my dad, is to put the company first in every decision you make. Because if you do that, and sprinkle in a little luck and good timing, your career will take care of itself. You don't need to be a pushy, selfish ass to get ahead."
offmychest,fehvhty,t1_feht772,1579124688.0,Thank you! And excellent advice.
offmychest,fehvepw,t1_fehscku,1579124637.0,"Thank you! And I knew someone would totally pick up on the ridiculous imposter syndrome thing. It's probably total nonsense, but so real feeling at times."
offmychest,fehv49r,t1_fehoava,1579124473.0,"You've got a great story, thanks for sharing! Also, top notch advice, and I thank you for it. I will make every effort to do what you suggest. Work hard, be honest and do my best."
offmychest,fdkmuoz,t1_fdjo5o2,1578506848.0,You have to drink a pretty yooge amount over a long time to have dangerous withdrawals. Yooge. At least that’s the case the vast majority of the time.
