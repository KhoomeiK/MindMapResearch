dogs,fffvjoq,t3_et8uk8,1579892728.0,"Usually the older dog will let the pup know when it is going too far and it will be a bark or a little nip, nothing serious.  That's how pups learn.  It's new in the world doesn't have a mother or pack to learn the boundaries from so your dog will give it that training.  And also take the puppy out to mix with other dogs and learn from them."
catsvstechnology,fffv3sz,t3_et50u2,1579892449.0,That's how cats tell their human slaves that you are not paying them enough attention.
asktransgender,fffuojl,t3_et8t9m,1579892186.0,I don't like the terms MTF or FTM because if someone is transgender they have been so from conception and are a gender in their own right.  MTF and FTM makes it sound like a decision that's been made where it's nature not a choice.
skeptics,ffa3xm4,t3_dxq1xb,1579727397.0,"I think it's essential the person receiving it believes in it, it's faith healing but a premium cost to the practitioner and client.  I had it done on me when I studying aroma therapy and because I have no time for it, it never worked on me.  What you want to try is go to a faith healing church and watch the people, now they do it free and they don't pay a master to be trained to be a healer and you might decide Reiki is a money making scam because the people in the church will be showing the same success results because they believe in it."
skeptics,ffa3705,t3_er20x5,1579726973.0,"In the modern western world I doubt it, I very much doubt place like the UK or USA are having babies because of the New Testament.  They're just too lazy or drunk to use birth control correctly."

aspd,ffa20cc,t3_esdq40,1579726290.0,"Everyone manipulates others to some degree, you have to get through life.  We  learn to do as children, when we want something, a treat, stay up late we all nice to our parent(s) that's manipulation.  There's a difference between what you are talking about and purposely manipulating someone and not giving a damn if you hurt them."
intersex,ffa1mqz,t3_eshq9m,1579726071.0,If it really bothers you talk to her about it.  I would simply because it creeps me out when people start calling each other Daddy and Mummy or Mommy when they're are in a sexual relationship.
asktransgender,ff5iuxa,t3_erl31h,1579594902.0,"You're comfortable in your own skin.  I use to always have an image of what being a woman was and I hated the masculine side of myself but now things have changed, people are being themselves they do want to be in a box labelled Male, Female, Transgender etc.  It's much better now, you be yourself without having to conform to  a expected image of what others tell you, you should be."

asktransgender,fe1nqk8,t3_encxjs,1578828735.0,The problem you have is if you tell her he could be transphobic and he doesn't react negatively to her she could tell him what you said and that will cause you problems.  I find it best not to try and second guess thing.  And I am sure your friend will have faced negative situations in the past and will know how to handle them.
BALLET,fdunvs5,t3_emdkm4,1578735999.0,"Going on pointe too early can cause major problems for a dancer later on in their career.  If they wear them too young, the bones in the feet are too soft and it will damage and deform them.  If the dancer is older but hasn't got to stage of being able to wear them (which you are saying) you could end up breaking your ankle or damaging your toes, knees, it's like any skill if you are at the correct stage to do it, there is more chance of injury.  So it best to wait than chance ruining a future career with injury.

As for using a pair to hang on the wall, get a pair you know don't fit then you won't be tempted to put them on.  And it is tempting."

intersex,fctt4mz,t3_eis27f,1577958142.0,You'd have to get a medical examination.  Many people are walking around who have no idea they are intersex.  You cannot see inside yourself and the physical aspects you describe could simply be that males can have big hips and fleshy pects but at the same time you could have some internal aspects that are female.  It happenes.
asktransgender,fcpog51,t3_eid2i9,1577868696.0,The only way you can try to get through it is to think there are many LGBTQI people whose families would never even consider coping.  At least by the sound of your post they are not abandoning you.  It's horrendous because you are you and in a fair world you should never be in the position that you have to accepted or rejected but life doesn't come with a free pass to being trouble free.  Just stay strong and hopefully you'll look back and see your outing as being a positive.

intersex,fc894ra,t3_egnzwo,1577529647.0,I think the reason can be that intersex people are so diverse in what defines them as being intersex and we have to remember may intersex people were given surgery as babies to make  them fit into one sex which was later discovered to be the wrong one.  So the more Drs understand what intersex means the better for intersex people themselves.
intersex,fc7l7py,t3_egc09p,1577511037.0,"The definition of being classified as intersex is surprisingly wide ranging. But it is biological, a person has to physically or their chromosomes show both sexes to some degree.  The majority of intersex people are ""labelled"" at birth though it is by no means unusually for someone to go through their whole life and it only be discovered they were intersex on a mortuary slab.   It is not a case a male being feminine or a female being masculine.  You have to see a specialist.  The information is out there and intersex people are working to become visible, but you cannot diagnose yourself."
