gaming,fds5tz8,t1_fds3z1j,1578695020.0,"You don't usually get fully twice the performance, but not that far off. 1.7-1.8 times the performance seems a reasonable estimate. (It's been a long time since I've run dual GPUs or researched it, so grain of salt to be taken) It depends on how well game devs have optimized for it (which I gather is less and less lately). 

From my limited understanding, the two graphics cards basically render half the frames each and they get combined into one output stream.   
  
&nbsp;  
  

Most PC gamers will make a compromise between graphical fidelity (settings/resolution) and framerate. With framerate being more important when you play fast paced games, especially if you wanna play competitively. With double GPUs you  can afford to run better graphics/resolution at the same high frames you can with a single card at lower settings."
