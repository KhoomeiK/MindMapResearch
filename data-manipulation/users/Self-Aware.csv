AmItheAsshole,fdozw2n,t1_fdnjttg,1578616691.0,"Let rice rest? Tell me, do you enjoy the actual physical experience of listeria or is it just the gambler's high of risk-taking that does it for you?"
AmItheAsshole,fdozahx,t3_em4xt9,1578616296.0,"Did you use a decent amount of fat or oil to fry them in? Bacon lardons seen to work particularly well, just let the fat begin to render before the veggies go in then fry/wok until bright green and starting to brown at the edges. Just to check the blindingly obvious- You cut them up too, of course, like cut off the stem-end and quartered the whole sprout? 


If you did the above then there is no earthly reason your side dish shouldn't have been tender and delicious. Maybe your pan was too hot? In the future, try just steaming them- cut and quarter as mentioned above and shove in the steamer for 7-10 minutes depending on your average size of sprout. Alternatively there's roasting too, button sprouts are best for this (peel some fresh garlic cloves and/or baby shallots, mix them in with the chopped brussels, oil everything well and roast the lot on medium-low for about 40 mins or until the garlic is golden). All delicious, relatively healthy and argument-free dinner options.


Seriously though dude, don't criticise someone while they are actively trying to cater to you. It never comes off well. Also, timing for multiple dishes to be ready simultaneously is an absolute bastard to get the hang of in the kitchen, you likely just dented her confidence and she got even more flustered once you'd (albeit unintentionally) thrown her off rhythm.


YTA, but make the effort to cook a few times (together too, is brilliant bonding time) and you should be out of the woods before long. Just remember to exercise a little tact next time :)"
