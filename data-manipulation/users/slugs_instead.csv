Edited to add that at 5’4”, I was often the largest woman in a group (and by a fair amount) when I was a size 8. In the Midwest, I’d usually be the smallest by far at that same size."

They asked me toenail a copy of my id (details except name and date of birth blacked out), and then about 24 hours later, they sent me the PayPal link. I left the prescription part blank. 

Edited to add that I ticked the pay by check box and then filled out the contact them form."

If I disengage then battery and the head, I’m not sure if the TSA screeners would notice it, but I do have to fly out of a small airport where they have all the time in the world to spend forever examining every piece of baggage. 

I really love it, and I’d really like to have it for after runs on trips."
