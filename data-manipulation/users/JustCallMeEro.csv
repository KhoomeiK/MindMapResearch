kindlefire,ffe101s,t3_ebxa8x,1579833900.0,"Chiming in - daughter's HD8 is sucking data at an insane rate. My monthly Comcast data was halved on the 9th! I normally don't hit that until the 20th-21st! I finally found the culprit - my daughter's Fire 8 was downloading about 80g of data a day! And I have no idea why, or how to stop it."
AskReddit,ff9umot,t3_esc8vq,1579721751.0,"Tell myself that no matter what my biological father told me, insisted in me, or what I assumed about myself because of what people said to me, or about me, isn't true. That I am worthy, and that I do belong. That people do want me around."
wholesomememes,fezs63h,t1_fezpynu,1579460958.0,"Lol, she's not a fan of that - has no issues with me sticking my head in the shower and watching, but there just isn't enough room for the two of us."
wholesomememes,fewj4xe,t1_fewic4p,1579411616.0,It's all part of the grand plan.
wholesomememes,fewfnu5,t1_feuwbqg,1579409806.0,"I make it a point to be in our bedroom doing... something, it doesn't matter, whenever my wife is in the shower so I can watch when she gets out. She just rolls her eyes at me, but it never gets old. Going on 12 years now, and I'm still the same lascivious man she married."
slowcooking,fepn5fn,t1_feoxikm,1579324963.0,I just go to my butcher and ask for pot roast. Delicious.

PNWS,feemi05,t1_feeddty,1579036755.0,"The main issue, at least with me, is that there was hardly any tying of any of the loose ends or new mysteries that they kept introducing. It just ... ended. 

I'll listen to the rest just to see the resolutions, but I remain skeptical."
PNWS,feemc2b,t1_feebqqr,1579036660.0,"As is the PNWS method. Amazing first seasons, and then a severe drop off in quality. Makes me nervous about the upcoming season 2 of Rabbits. I LOVED the first season, but know the second is going to go the way of Tanis and TBT."
AskRedditAfterDark,fe33yms,t1_fe327tn,1578845692.0,"That's fucking rough, bud, sorry to hear that."
AskRedditAfterDark,fe2whgj,t1_fe2vanv,1578843647.0,"Fuck, that sounds rough. Insurance would cover that since it's not a true reversal, right?"
AskRedditAfterDark,fe2v1ff,t1_fe2km18,1578843152.0,"Ah, that sucks bud - sorry to hear that. What does the doc say re: the pain?"
AskRedditAfterDark,fdzz6ad,t1_fdzt31m,1578799301.0,"I had residual pain for about 6 months. Nothing bad, doc said it was normal - but every now and then there would just be a sharp pain in my nuts."
AskRedditAfterDark,fdzz0ys,t1_fdzw3ix,1578799215.0,"Just feels like a pretty good pinch and something heavy sitting on your waist during the procedure. After that there was some ball pain for about a week, but that's normal. My doc did the full kit and caboodle. 

 Had mine about 2 years ago, and it was the best decision I ever made."
