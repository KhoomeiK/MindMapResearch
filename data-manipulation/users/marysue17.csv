There could literally be millions of other habitable planets out there. We will find out everything in due time, but it likely won’t be in this lifetime. And that’s ok. Don’t let the little things bog you down."
AmItheAsshole,ffbi7or,t3_espkrv,1579766475.0,"NTA. But you will probably have to wait until your child is a bit older. And that’s probably the best thing to do anyways. Let the child in on the decision making. Maybe do it just before school-age or something. That way, your child will understand why it was done."
AmItheAsshole,ffbhn2f,t3_espveb,1579765713.0,"ESH. He’s a jerk for what he says and does, but you probably took it too far, although you probably didn’t realize it would cause others to say what they did. 

Words are powerful at your age. I know he hurt you, but maybe hurting him back did more damage to him than what he did to you. Ya gotta pick your battles."

lds,ff87h68,t1_ff7xzsc,1579668188.0,No I’m not in counseling. I’m not depressed. I’m just really hurt that no one at church ever talks to me or reaches out to me. They treat me like I’m not there half the time.
lds,ff2e6mm,t1_ff2e4h0,1579502463.0,I like that idea!
lds,ff2blrj,t1_ff2bhs0,1579499782.0,Not really. Not anyone close. Just people I know around town that I talk to on occasion when I see them. And some friends that live out of town.
lds,ff1psyv,t1_ff021k8,1579483487.0,"My husband has collected it for years. But I don’t qualify because I don’t have enough credits since I stayed home with our kids more than I worked. Also, my conditions are very rare and social security doesn’t have them in their system has a qualifying disability."
AmItheAsshole,ff1822b,t3_eqythl,1579476130.0,"Don’t out them. Be the bigger person. Idk how religious you are, but they remind me of the Pharisees from the Bible. They put of a big show of the righteousness for others to see, but they really aren’t that good in their hearts. Many many people are like this these days. It’s truly sad."
lds,ff0a2vh,t1_ff091t9,1579466799.0,"It’s not even that I expect or am really hurt about the service. It would just be nice if people would talk to me at meetings. They just walk right by me. I smile at them and even say hi, but they don’t talk to me. It just hurts. And I’ve been told in the past about one particular sister spreading lies about me. Idk if she’s still doing it. I just don’t know what else I can do."
AmItheAsshole,fezs0ih,t3_er08eg,1579460901.0,"NTA. Try to find a home for him with someone that can handle his problems. There are people out there that will take in dogs like this, you just have to find them. He’s considered a high maintenance dog. You can’t provide him with everything he needs since you have small children and an elderly MIL in the home. You also don’t have the skills to address his particular needs, and that’s ok. Many people don’t. Contact a chow rescue or some other local rescue and talk to the people there. See if there is someone they know who could take him in."
AmItheAsshole,fezpu8g,t3_er0dhs,1579460153.0,NTA. This was not cultural appropriation. You allowed 2 kids to draw on you. People need to get over themselves.

You rebounded pretty quick. His friend was a jerk. He should be a little more understanding that you thought y’all had broken up. 

Makes me think of Friends. “We were on a break!”"

AmItheAsshole,fdptey0,t3_emmjcj,1578639761.0,ESH. She’s shouldn’t have moved your stuff. And you shouldn’t have touched her. Two wrongs don’t make a right.
AmItheAsshole,fdps6zg,t3_emn039,1578638435.0,"NTA. But why are y’all even going to parties? If she just got out of rehab, she shouldn’t be going anywhere where there would be so much temptation. 
And stop letting her keep your phone and keys. She’s obviously not responsible enough to hold onto those."
AmItheAsshole,fdprm6b,t3_emn2dc,1578637833.0,NTA. It’s your graduation. You should get to choose who comes and who doesn’t. Your dad needs to get over himself.
AmItheAsshole,fdj7auf,t3_elmocj,1578460471.0,"NAH. It’s easy to get frustrated with your aging parents, especially with them living with you. But remember that they won’t be around much longer and when that day comes, you would give your right arm to have them back in your life and giving you a hard time. 

My mom passed away 2 and a half years ago. Her last few months were difficult, to say the least. But I would give anything to have her back right now. I miss her and my kids miss her. And she never had the chance to meet her great grandkids. 

Just try to remember that their brains aren’t as sharp as they once were, their bodies don’t work as well as they used to, and they do actually need the extra help. It won’t last forever."
AskReddit,fdj2dso,t3_elhvjj,1578456656.0,SOS! White grave with hamburger meat served over toast. That was my favorite. I haven’t had it in years because I can’t make gravy like my mom could!

AmItheAsshole,fdfylym,t3_el57pr,1578373887.0,"ESH. y’all need to communicate. If your fiancé isn’t the woman you left your wife for, you need to clear that up with your daughter. And you also need to be honest with your daughter about what happened between you and her mom. Communication is so important in situations like this. Spend some alone time with her and talk it all out. And then give her time. Set boundaries about how you expect her to treat your fiancé."
AmItheAsshole,fdftpil,t3_el32ez,1578369964.0,"YTA. Your wife lost someone she loved dearly and you took something from her that can’t be replaced and you don’t even seem to care. That’s a jerk move. 
My mom passed away 2.5 years ago and I still have the last few voicemails from her saved on my phone. I’ve made sure they would transfer over to my new phone. My husband totally understands this and I love him even more for it. Try to have some compassion for your wife."

AmItheAsshole,fd4m7em,t3_ejw77a,1578168836.0,NTA. Uncle and aunt deserved to be called out. Your dad totally deserved the praise. You are a wonderful child for doing that.
cats,fcyjr8v,t3_ejgv7z,1578081242.0,I’m so sorry.
AmItheAsshole,fcyjllm,t3_eji1h3,1578081159.0,"YTA. She had 2 positive tests. Others have given good reasons as to why those were probably accurate. In her heart and mind, she was actually pregnant for a short time and then it was ripped away from her. That’s equivalent to a miscarriage. Be a friend and be supportive."
lds,fcrqaa9,t1_fcricfb,1577905181.0,"No. Because you wear them all the time, like underwear. Get at least 4 sets if money is tight. Your first time, you do get a discount. So take advantage of that. 
And don’t worry about your ceremonial clothing just yet. Most temples rent those out or possibly you could borrow some from somebody in your ward.  
Talk to your bishop about your money issues. They may have a fund to help, or maybe someone in your ward will be willing to help with al the expenses. Do you have an escort yet? You need an escort when you go in. It will be another woman who helps you figure all this out and guides you through your day at the temple."

lds,fcpojt0,t3_ecgrye,1577868757.0,"My brothers first wife left him for another woman. She decided she was a lesbian. She left the church at the same time. My brother met another woman who had never been married and they wanted to be sealed in the temple, but wanted to cancel the first sealing. It took some time, but it happened. This was in 2014 I think. So yes, a sealing can be canceled, nullified, or whatever you want to call it. 

Many people call it a temple divorce just to make it easier to explain what you’re saying, but that’s not truly what it is."
lds,fcpm455,t3_egk627,1577867287.0,"In my little branch, some parents will sit in on the seminary classes. Idk if your ward would allow it, but you could ask. You can also probably get a seminary manual online to study at home."
lds,fcpkyse,t3_eibo2o,1577866611.0,"Our clothing store in the temple allows you to try on garments before you buy them. Get 1 set your your session since you can’t try them on before you’re endowed. Then after your session, go try some on (unless you like the fit of the 1st set you got) and find the right fit for you. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. All of the temple workers are sweet and love to offer help and guidance. Garments are around $3.50 a piece(top or bottom). You will need to have enough to last you between laundry days. Keep that in mind."
