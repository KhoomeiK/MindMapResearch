Just because there is 30 hours of content doesn't mean it's the same quality as another 60$ game's 30 hours of content. It's good you had fun with it, but you are also trying to justify a purchase that wasn't worth it because you fell for some kind of a hype. And there is nothing wrong with that either"

Gypsies, which are significant part of the population don't care, they vote for whoever gives them 20 euros and live in misery, not paying any bills and not caring about anything outside their neighbourhood. They don't let their kids attend school, because they prefer to put them on the streets, begging for money, or look after the rest of their huge family. Young people are not enough and more and more of them (me included) run away to other countries. There needs to be a radical change in order for something to happen."
europe,ff5v0or,t1_ff40vdc,1579611206.0,"People don't have the power to change it. The corruption is incredibly high and as I said, there are no new faces in the political spectrum - you don't stand a chance if the people in power decide you are a threat. It is not like some third-world country if you get what I mean, but the standard of life, for at least 80% of the population, is incredibly low. Money and power corrupt even decent people, it is very rare for someone who actually care about others to get in charge. A simple example - we have a guy, who dealt (and still deals) with the mafia become a prime-minister. Look some of his speeches, he is an embarrassment compared to all other European politicians. All city mayors are corrupt, using tax and euro-projects money to fill their own pockets. Here is another example: the European Union gave 10 million euros to our city to build a few children playgrounds. There was a bid set between a few building companies to decide which one wins the project and get the job done. Usually, it is expected that the one which puts the best price/time/quality of materials offer wins the bid. The mayor (or his entourage) chose the company that put price 8 times higher than the second most expensive offer and later it turned out, the company that won is actually a BAKERY owned by one of his cousins. It's both fun and sad to watch"

It doesn't matter if they were hardworking intelligent people - former teachers, directors or people who contributed a lot the society - they are all live in poverty and it's just so sad. My grandmother cannot belive I make more than her entire monthly pension in a single 8-hour day in the UK.

I don't. Stopped 1 year ago, it's a complete waste of money and while Valve deserved the monthly price they charge for it the first 3 months after release, they don't anymore. People are too anxious because playing the game will not record some stupid stats against their profile and they can't realise how meaningless these stats actually are. Nobody cares if you have or haven't dota plus and it doesn't add any collection value to your account. Once you play 5 games without dota plus, you actually realise there is no difference and you save a bit of money.
