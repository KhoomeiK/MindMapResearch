AskMen,fdxgjxp,t1_fduj3lz,1578768493.0,"I was swinging keys on a lanyard like a ninja and I racked myself so hard it took my breath away. About 5 days later I noticed my left ball was swollen but wasn’t hurting. Figured I really fucked myself up and It’d take some time to heal. About two months went by and not only was it still swollen, but it was also larger than before. Around the third month the it stopped getting bigger but stayed about the size of large egg. I did a bit of my own web research and came to the conclusion I had testicular torsion. I left it alone for a little while longer but eventually I had to tell my wife why I was avoiding sex. She’s a nurse so the instant she seen it she said “get in the fucking car we’re going to the ER”.  I assured her there was no pain and informed her what I had thought it was because of my research. She humored me and gave it another two weeks before she made an appointment and hauled me in. Turns out it wasn’t testicular torsion, it was testicular cancer and that it had more than likely already been swollen but I just didn’t notice it. 

So to wrap up my story, fucking get yourselves checked boys, or do at home checks in the shower."
