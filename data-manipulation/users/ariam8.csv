NarcissisticAbuse,fcmp1ie,t3_ehsb85,1577785133.0,"My mom’s a narc and I began dating a narc. What blows my mind is that you’re right the whole time they were putting people against me, while I was living with his parents I was depressed as hell and he would have his parents talk down on me and lecture me on how I wasn’t behaving properly since I would drink often, he would blame everything on me without me knowing there was even a case were we both fought in the car he wouldn’t stop restraining me and I have major ptsd from people holding me down or holding me to where I can’t go anywhere; anyways after the fight I swore I don’t even remember bitting him hard but I bit him and he pressed charges on me and he told my parents another whole story of what had happened and two months later I had to fly back and serve jail time."
