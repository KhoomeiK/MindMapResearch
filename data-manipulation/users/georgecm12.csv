mildlyinteresting,ff4f7rh,t1_ff4d7xg,1579562174.0,"Paper currency is more compact than a dollar coin, and easily carried in a men's pocket wallet. Men's wallets aren't really designed around coins; you could put them in the currency section, but they'd just slip right out, and they'd make the wallet bulky.

I can just put coins in my pocket, but then I have a heavy pocket full of bulky coins jingling around, which is annoying. I could get a coin pouch, but to me, that's something an old person would carry around.

So, I prefer not carrying coins at all whenever possible.

The only two advantages to dollar coins over paper dollars that I can think of:

1. They can work more reliably in vending machines, but these days, I'll probably use a credit card.
2. They're more durable than paper dollars, but frankly, that's not my problem, that's the government's."

My guess, based on my experience: Using the badge results in a log entry in their security software. It might not necessarily be something that anyone is going to be paying that close attention to on a regular basis... after all, it's a legitimate badge, and it's going to be just another successful ""swipe-in"" grouped with thousands and thousands of other successful swipe-ins.

Now, if something happens to bring it to someone's attention, like some sort of periodic audit, or what not... now those entries are going to be giant red flags. Now, a lot of people are going to be wanting to figure out who has an unauthorized, real badge, and what they doing there.

They probably don't want to disable the badge right away. Disabling it just keeps them off the campus. Instead, they want to figure out who has this badge, and why, and what they're doing on the campus. So, let them keep using it, but then send corporate security out hunting them down when they arrive and try using the badge."

In any case, the article above goes into a little more info about what ""security footprint"" means. It's not the ""no-go"" zone, but it will be a headache for anyone having to go into and through that area.

That's one (of many) areas where the M:I movies disappointed me compared to the TV show(s). Yes, the TV shows had the masks and imaginary spy gadgets, but they still relied a lot on intelligent characters doing smart stuff with the imaginary tech and the masks. The movies dropped almost any pretense of intelligence for a dumb action movie with stunts every two minutes.

And that's one area where Sneakers is great, and offers echoes back to the M:I tv show. It has the imaginary Cetec Astronomy box, which is on par with some of the imaginary masks and other tech from M:I... but like the M:I TV show(s), Sneakers still relies on smart people doing smart things with the imaginary tech."

All these companies do is take your money from you, then turn around and deposit it for you in one or more actual banks. You don't get to know where your money is, or even have direct access to it.

They may advertise that  your money is FDIC insured, but remember, you're not the depositor. You're giving your money to Wealthfront, and \*they\* deposit the money. Therefore, \*they\* are the beneficiary of the FDIC insurance.

personalfinance,fcujtb9,t1_fcu8jbx,1577982623.0,"Doing it manually does a few things:

1. It allows you to catch incorrect amounts, transactions you didn't make, transactions that are double-entered by the merchant, or transactions you made but didn't get processed through.

2. It catches transactions that don't show up on the bank's transaction history for days (or longer) after the purchase is made, by which time you may have forgotten about it, which could get you into trouble by over-allocating your available funds.

Getting into this mindset right off the bat will hopefully help keep you away from the idea, ""Oh, I don't have the money for this... no worries, I can just put it on the plastic for now."" That's asking for problems... that's how people get into credit card debt.

Depending on how much trash you have to dispose, you could either get one of those ""bagsters"" from Waste Management, or an actual dumpster, and have the trash hauled away. Still a cost, possibly more than the dump fees, but possibly less time consuming.

You could also call a trash removal company like a 1-800-GOT-JUNK or similar. Probably the same thing - more expensive than dump fees, less time consuming.

That's probably why companies like Intuit allowed this update to go through in the first place; they know that the threat that the IRS could develop their own software would be an empty one.

You could try the software out, and if you get to a point where you are stumped and have no idea what to do, you could just change your mind and take your taxes to a professional.
