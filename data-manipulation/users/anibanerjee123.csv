I do have a goal to one day become an astronaut. It all started when Michael Massimino (retired NASA astronaut) came to our school to give a talk about his life. Before I met him, I was just another unmotivated high schooler with deteriorating grades and no goal for the future. However, after I met him, I received a purpose for life. I wanted to pursue the goal of being an astronaut, and I had to follow through with this goal.

My GPA is kinda average, but I have a lot of extracurricular activities and I tried really hard on my college essays so I have been able to get into some pretty good colleges that will be able to help me down this path. I'm right now trying to get the Astronaut Scholarship Award, which will probably help me in the future. I am trying to research potential career paths for me to follow. I want to be able to offer something unique to the astronaut program that will get me noticed, but I haven't started University yet, so I haven't had much exposure to opportunities presented to me.

Right now, I am trying to make myself a more disciplined person. It is really hard because I am a huge procrastinator and I am very undisciplined. However, I want to forge myself into an outstanding student by the time I get to college and stand out from the rest of my peers. Taking the initiative will be hard, but I am seriously committed to this goal and I will do anything I can to better myself."

If I had never met him, I have no idea what I would be doing now. I would probably be a depressed loser with zero aspirations in life.

For me, I have realized that motivation is the reason why I have decided to start turning all my late assignments in on time and raising my D in my cs class to a B.
