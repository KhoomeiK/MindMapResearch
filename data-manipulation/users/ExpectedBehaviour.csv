Roz did have to go through casting and in fact Peri Gilpin was *second* choice – they first cast Lisa Kudrow, who would go on to lasting fame as Phoebe in *Friends*, but she didn’t gel with the rest of the cast and was subsequently replaced by Gilpin before filming started.

In case you were wondering:

• As mentioned, second choice for Niles Crane was Peter MacNicol, perhaps most well-known from Ally McBeal.

• Second choice for Martin Crane was Robert Prosky, who ended up appearing on the show as TH Houghton in the episode “Crane’s Critique”.

• Second choice for Daphne Moon was Rosie Perez, who would appear in one of the flashbacks in the episode “Crock Tales”. This is perhaps the most interesting “what-if” as it would have changed Daphne from English to Puerto Rican, and almost certainly given her character a different name."

Since then *Red Dwarf* has been a one-man effort run entirely by Doug Naylor, including the release of the novel “Last Human” in 1995, with two notable exceptions: Rob Grant’s solo book “Backwards” released in 1996, and the only time Grant and Naylor have collaborated on anything since the mid-90s, completing the script for “Bodysnatcher”, an unfilmed episode from *Red Dwarf*’s first season that was included as part of a special DVD release in 2007. (Notably, this collaboration was conducted entirely via email. There were no face-to-face meetings between Grant and Naylor.)

biology,fctq22h,t1_fctl24a,1577953665.0,"- “So are you saying...”. No., I’m not saying that at all. This is an example of a straw man; mischaracterising my argument to make it easier to attack. My incredulity in there being MANY theories at once to explain the same phenomenon is that this would indicate none of them are particularly strong or compelling.

- I’m not sure what you mean by “absolute theory”, but that’s not a term I’ve ever heard being used in a scientific context.

- “That’s why it’s a theory” - You aren’t using the word “theory” in the scientific context here, which is quite different to the everyday colloquial context. This is why I said that saying something in science is “just a theory” is bad, because it immediately shows that you don’t understand what the term really means. A theory in a scientific context might best be described as a model or mechanism; it doesn’t just say “X causes Y”, it says “X causes Y because of this underlying process or processes, and we can use this to make predictions which can then be tested experimentally for accuracy”. Theories remain theories even after they’ve been proven* because they remain the best explanation we have for describing and modelling a phenomenon - cf. the gene theory of inheritance, the germ theory of disease, cell theory, atomic theory, Copernican theory, the theory of relativity. The scientific term closest to what you seem to be meaning from your use of “theory” is “hypothesis”. The terms are not synonymous. 

*The philosopher of science Karl Popper showed that theories can never actually be proven to be true, only proven to be false; and this falsifiability is a cornerstone of scientific thought. For the sake of brevity I’m using “proven” here as a synonym for “widely accepted”; that is, currently assumed to be the best explanation available and definitely not falsified yet."
