classicwow,ffv4xlx,t1_ffumdvl,1580255769.0,I preregistered back in August. I'm just pissed Blizzard didn't introduce faction based queues to curb the imbalance. My server (Grob) has never had faction balance issues but we're still punished. I deliberately picked Grob in part due to the balance.
tressless,ffv3ih0,t1_fft5iw3,1580254823.0,"Do organ donations fall under this? I imagine it's not desired for blood donations due to the affect it has on children and enough alternative blood being available, but the high demand for organs seems like it'd change that.

Edit: it appears it's fine for organ donations. The risk with blood is due to pregnant women."
politics,ffupt0b,t1_ffuf4ee,1580246991.0,"Exactly. Weed at worst has negative cognitive effects while children are still developing, and for adults inhibits their ambitions (best described as helping you be content with being bored). Alcohol on the other hand destroys your body, literally, while reducing inhibitions that keep you from becoming a monster. To me it makes absolutely no sense why alcohol is legal and weed isn't beyond ignorance."
politics,ffupff9,t1_ffuemw0,1580246778.0,"Bolton's reputation was trashed by Trump; I've always seen this as payback for the blow to his pride. Also Trump works for his own interests, not the party, which Bolton allegedly had concerns about."
tressless,ffumkiv,t1_ffufnu8,1580245132.0,What was the reason for quitting?
videos,ffulx2q,t1_ffuhmbh,1580244739.0,Exactly. The frequency response of vacuum tubes aren't exactly a mystery.
blackmagicfuckery,ffuhxob,t1_fftjweh,1580242321.0,So the electricity is flowing through the wet surface rather than through the board itself it seems.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffugmpo,t1_ffu8i5b,1580241537.0,Anyone who would actually try to call you out for that is just unnecessarily being an ass for the sake of it. Or they're just dumb enough to not realize it was a typo.
AdviceAnimals,ffuf41h,t1_ffu3voi,1580240634.0,"This is one reason why regulations are so important. In a purely capitalist society where the only oversight is profit and competition, morals go out the window."

sysadmin,ffu35ey,t1_fftevy3,1580233481.0,"Funny enough it's very common to do this to get around bribery laws. You hire a chinese company to interface with the locals and do the ""local customs""."
Austin,ffu2e7e,t1_fftk8dk,1580233018.0,Because they can adjust their budget allocation based on the needs of the department?

WhitePeopleTwitter,fftlzms,t1_fftlad1,1580223958.0,One is optional one isn't. Also you don't know how this person's condition is affecting them even in classes.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fftluki,t1_fftig04,1580223861.0,The limit is just what the school is willing to fund.
LoveIslandTV,ffspi0i,t1_ffrlzvy,1580188002.0,"I generally prefer black hair and fair skin, so I end up mostly preferring white (think italian) or asian. Don't get me wrong, plenty of gorgeous women of color, I just have my preferences that I tend towards. It's no more racist than someone who prefers more tan skin or someone who prefers natural red heads. Sexual preferences are one of the few things we're allowed to be picky about when it comes to physical appearance, that's the whole point of it after all."
Music,ffsp66l,t1_ffsi9hb,1580187712.0,"I like literally thousands of songs on spotify that are spread across countless bands. I listen to a bit of everything, rap, rock, alternative, christian contemporary, pop, you name it, and I usually have a few songs that are my favorites from each group. Nothing wrong with not limiting yourself to what you like. For example, I don't really enjoy Taylor Swift but she has 2 songs I really like on my favorite list. Same goes for a few songs from The Game that I really liked when I was younger. I aint buying an entire CD for a song here and there."
Music,ffsox6j,t1_ffrzx26,1580187491.0,"Everyone needs to take a long hard look at how Chinese musicians make their money. In China music is freely available to all citizens, there's no fee required. Musicians make their money from performances, merchandising, advertising/endorsements, streaming with donations, etc. This idea that musicians make money off recordings is a very recent phenomenon in human history, and isn't a necessary one. And yes, the industry is flooded to the brim with competition, it's hard to make it and not everyone is entitled to be a successful musician."
Music,ffsos3l,t1_ffsaq7a,1580187367.0,"The difference here is that she stole first before being granted that allowance, taking the power of licensing rights away from the artist. Here he is giving her a free pass, but it hurts the integrity of the industry, especially artists in a much less fortunate position."
Music,ffsoo5c,t1_ffs2rm3,1580187271.0,"The idea is that he is unfortunately continuing the stereotype that artists don't mind being ""paid in exposure"" instead of actually making a living off their work. In this case, she should have asked for permission from him before doing this."

AskReddit,ffrpm9e,t1_ffr7qie,1580163014.0,"Not so much obsessed as they are taught it in primary school so they can randomly incorporate it into their speech and writing, often times for emphasis."
hardware,ffroj9m,t3_eutadd,1580162343.0,"If you can guarantee that you have complete control over the hardware, aren't the performance benefits of TSX worth it? For example if you had a dedicated bare metal box (no VM, no other processes) to host your database on. Or does the issues with TSX go beyond security?"
OurPresident,ffro3v1,t1_ffr83he,1580162080.0,Twice that is doable if you're willing to move somewhere more reasonably priced. Austin for example goes from super pricey to downright cheap within an hour of driving.
mildlyinfuriating,ffrhp6p,t1_ffr4fgq,1580158232.0,"On ear are my favorite, but they need to be just tight enough to stay on. I can't stand in-ear ones (I don't like stuff inside my ear) and over-ear ones are too clunky for casual use other than at my desk."
blunderyears,ffrh2uf,t1_ffr8hcl,1580157906.0,She's implying that she is a straight woman who is just appreciating this person's look. Then again I'm pretty sure you're just trolling.
television,ffrb389,t1_ffr899t,1580154353.0,"It's like you completely ignored my second sentence. Do you actually think people with learning disabilities, dementia, poor education, etc also deserve to be screwed by every clever scammer out there? Just their fault for being ""retarded"" right?"
politics,ffr7zgz,t3_eupf9b,1580152436.0,If Romney was ambitious enough I'm convinced he could turn the Senate against Trump and become the next Republican presidential nominee. The Trump effect is way too overstated and it would be so easy to throw Trump under the bus for all the hate the GOP gets.
CrappyDesign,ffr6rod,t1_ffqy1lr,1580151673.0,Part of the argument is that it creates more difficulty than it helps.
television,ffr63sz,t1_ffqpgaq,1580151266.0,Ah yes because spreading ignorance and misinformation is a totally acceptable thing for a company to do. And if anyone falls for it (especially people with poor education/upbringing or lower intelligence/learning disorders outside their control) they especially deserve it.
Morrowind,ffr5ia5,t1_ffqfwp0,1580150897.0,"When you first start out as melee you usually miss damn near everything, and for casters you run out of mana almost immediately. So any noob that does this quest near the start of the game is going to get wrecked."

TooAfraidToAsk,ffp1wyo,t1_ffml1g9,1580084524.0,We don't know the mortality rate since most people infected still have it. The mortality rate is estimated at around 3% which is over 100x more lethal than the common influenza strains and only 3 times lower than SARS. So yes it is quite dangerous considering how contagious it is.
worldnews,ffojrdh,t1_ffjvuie,1580078397.0,Isn't what we're seeing good though? Don't we want people to be overly cautious in regard to this virus? What are the drawbacks of people taking extra precautions?
worldnews,ffoji2l,t1_ffldb0j,1580078338.0,"What even is the mortality rate of coronavirus? I'm under the impression that most of the infected are not cured yet, so we don't really know the mortality rate yet."

atheism,ffo8f0q,t1_ffg9fk1,1580075150.0,"That's certainly one way to explain it. When you control reality, you can manipulate the users into practically anything you want. The question is whether something with power and intelligence on such a universal scale would stoop to such petty tactics, and if so, what does he get out of it knowing they only follow and love him because they are falsely manipulated into it. Why even bother with free will at that point, you're essentially ignoring it anyways."
insaneparents,ffo6s51,t3_eu93us,1580074709.0,"That post is just dripping with enablement, that poor kid never stood a chance with those shitty parents. It's everyone's fault but his own. It's not his fault he OD'd on heroin, it's not his fault he has HIV from shooting up heroin. It's obviously the vaccine the gave their son HIV right?"
politics,ffn053d,t1_ffmr6g5,1580060644.0,I'm saying that the debate format does a disservice to all candidates. Bernie just happened to be the one who explained it.

politics,ffmmhtf,t1_ffmk7k3,1580056691.0,Bernie actually discussed this issue in an interview. He said the debates are akin to reality tv where everyone is just trying to get soundbites because you aren't ever getting a proper debate when you have 30s to state your argument.
classicwow,ffk6ipd,t1_ffif7cs,1580017491.0,"We literally have many times the population as vanilla. All else equal, 3x the population with the same spawn rate means triple the lotus price. Throw in the min-maxing obsession of classic and the price goes up even higher."
