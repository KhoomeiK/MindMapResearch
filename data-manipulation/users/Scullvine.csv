Select which skin is your lines (or alternately right click on the lines and select ""manage"") then select ""unload"". To select your skin, open the options from the left column until you find the one responsible for the lines. You can differentiate the skins you have loaded and the ones you don't by the button on the right side saying ""load"" or ""unload"". If the names of the skins aren't descriptive enough to tell you which one is responsible for the lines, you can find the skins that have been loaded this way and one-by-one unload them.
