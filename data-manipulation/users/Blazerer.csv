Die huizen gaan verder en verder weg van stadscentra. Het is simpelweg niet mogelijk om van iemand te verwachten dat die 2 uur van zijn werk gaat wonen. Het enige dat je doet is ieder jaar dat probleem een stukje verder van het stadscentrum verschuiven. Het eindresultaat is exact hetzelfde. Idealiter zou er alleen een lage en lage-middeklasse huur moeten zijn. Als je een inkomen daarboven hebt zou je nooit moeten hoeven huren vanwege huizennood. Huur is er als overbruggingsmethode en voor mensen voor wie koophuizen te duur zijn, verder heeft het weinig plek in een samenleving waarin wij nu leven. En zeer zeker niet als financieel spaarpotje voor Nederlandse en buitenlandse investeerders.
