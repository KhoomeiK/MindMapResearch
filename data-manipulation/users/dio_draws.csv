CallOfDutyMobile,ffgahyx,t3_etg7zl,1579901973.0,I was wondering how one can change the zombie map after downloading them nor sure how to get that done and also it would be awesome to see more variety and attachments that are more gun type specific for example rapid fire is a big that comes to mind
motivation,ffejvr3,t1_ffejbfb,1579851045.0,"Hahaha thanks for pointing that out. Wasnt paying touch much attention to my grammer there, thanks!"
motivation,ffejbaw,t3_esshnm,1579850349.0,"I would highly encourage anyone that thinks like this to look into paradigms I'm no master at this but know enough to say that those kind of thoughts are basically like a habit for example if you fold your hands together, unfold them and then fold them again but in the opposite way it feels different and your brain is like no that doesn't feel right but do it like that over a long period of time and it'll feel and be normal for you. Your thoughts are the same way (to some extent at least) at first when you encourage yourself your brain is going to say no that doesn't feel right and the negative thought will try to ""correct"" you as that's what's it's used to but if you keep at it eventually you'll get to the point where the negative thought will no longer try and if it does it won't he hard to stop it. But it doesn't just stop there you actually have to BELIEVE that are feeling good, doing better, etc etc whatever it may be  for it to truly take it's affect.... Again I'm no professional just sharing a bit of what I've learned from videos and books if you've read this far I'm assuming I peaked your interest and would highly recommend watching Bob Proctor on YouTube as most of my knowledge of paradigms comes from him . Thanks for reading. You got this !!!"

learnart,ff11mu9,t3_eqy8id,1579474370.0, I love the colors in the sky !
learnart,ff11ce2,t1_ff0w4t1,1579474282.0,Cause just like a large or small drawing its what dictates 1. The porportion of things and big or small things would have to be to show depth (ex. A rock that looks big in small portrait will look very small in a large potrait) 2. How much harder it would be to but detail into it (ex. a small portrait drawing of say 4x4 is going to be alot harder to put detail in as apposed to 10x10 portrait) like the wrinkles would have to be alot smaller in that smaller portrait. I hope I was able to answer your question :)

dragonballfighterz,fej7axc,t1_fej6yik,1579159900.0,"Thank you I appreciate the info. do you think buying the characters at full price is worth it? I bought jiren and Saiyan gods at a discount but I think 5 dollars for a character is a bit much.
