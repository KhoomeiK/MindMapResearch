40kLore,ff911xa,t3_es8mkd,1579702154.0,"Definitely Kurze and the Night Lords against the Tau because Terror works great against them (killing Etherals off and broadcasting it live to all septs in range? Yikes, good bye greater good) ... Then maybe Death Guard and me-self too, same ish reasons. Just instead of terror through violence it's fear of the unstoppable and unrelenting force and their horrifying weaponry.

Tyranids? Guillaume and Horus. Guillaume for the Sector organization and Horus for the actual big battles. Flamer weapons are also great so Vulkan comes to mind and defenses seem to work better than offenses so maybe Dorn or Perty but I'll stick with Roboute and Lupercal I think

Definitely Iron Hands+ Ferrus vs Necrons... But I'm not sure who else. Maybe Corax+ Raven Guard for ""shutdown"" assassinations and sabotages of awakening tomb worlds.

Against the Orks we're really spoiled for choice... Out of Sanguinius, Angron, the Lion and Leman Russ anyone would be a great pick imo. But since Sanguinius is imo superior overall to the other 3 he's the first pick... And maybe that's enough savagery so it's better to pick Fulgrim to assist on the flanks and stuff... Or Dorn to hold all gains, let the BA do the conquering and then bunker down with the Fists. And yet again Vulkan comes to mind because of flamers... Even more so than for Tyranids, destroying the funghi spores that Orks produce is reeeeally important. 

And Drukhari are again an easy one for me, White Scars and the Khan go in and the Alpha Legion+ Alpharius/Omegon supply the intel of where to strike and they also kill the archons and deliberately create conflict in between the Drukhari. Yeah... This one is quite the exciting imagination for me haha"

Super fun. Cool sniping, cool vehicles, cool future stuff like drones (and this was before everyone did it and this one is *actually* cool and without wall running and stuff) and anti vehicle was not as clunky as CoD, they really thought about it. You didn't need a class with a javelin or rpg to switch to after getting farmed by vehicles, you just had that extra slot where you could put a buyable rocket launcher in which was comparatively much cheaper than the actual vehicles so if you had a vehicle you had to be careful about infantry and I loved that"

If you like games about the second world war this is already interesting for you. If you like innovative strategy games this is almost a must buy. If you also like big scale and the amazing seemless zoom that they implemented+the absolute genius of their whole ""intelligence is key, there is no fog of war but rather you just don't see what a unit is exactly until it gets into line of sight or you use a spy or a recon plain/car"" concept, then it probably is your new favorite game for quite a while... Even the economy system in the game is super interesting (it has supply lines instead of mines or other classic RTS resources) and it has all the major factions of world war 2 as playable factions, it's quite ballanced even though each one has their own strengths and weaknesses. Oh, and as a bonus, you can play the game set to 39, 42 or 45 to experience the difference in technology at different times during the war (45 is the standard game mode online because everything can be researched) but there's also a total war mode (cheeky name) where you cycle through the three periods in one game... And there's an atomic war game mode which is also fun with friends because one single unit can destroy a whole base and any army in one shot which makes airforce and thinly spread armies much more effective than they already were :)
