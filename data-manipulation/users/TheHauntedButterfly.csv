Advice,ffhfz7r,t1_ffhbf9k,1579933622.0,"Yeah my son's phone doesn't actually have any calling or texting on it, just wifi. He used to be allowed to use other things like YouTube on it but he started behaving weird and having nightmares so I checked his history and apparently he somehow ended up on a bunch of horribly inappropriate videos that looked like they were geared towards children but were actually really dark and creepy or said awful things disguised as something silly so we limited his time on it and made it so that he could only play the games we chose for him. 


The family we do know has always been really kind and she seems to get along really well with them but I would be lying if I said that sometimes things didnt seem a little sketchy from time to time. I definitely want to be as kind as possible but I doubt that she took a liking to me. I don't think I've ever really spoken to her even when she's stayed over at our house besides telling her where the bathroom or asking her nicely to stop doing something bad. 


I was hoping I'd find a way to contact her family to deal with this before I had to actually respond to her but it definitely seems like I'll have to come up with something to say. I just feel really bad if she only got this messenger just so she could get in contact with my son since I'm sure she misses him a lot. We've had instances before where she has called my husband's phone at 6am and woken us up to try and talk to our son, only to end up hearing her dad get upset with her (rightly so, not in a bad way) because she apparently stole his phone while he was sleeping or times where she has sent text messages to us when her dad has been in the bathroom or in the backyard. I don't think she really understands that our son doesn't get these messages and that we are the ones on the other side of it."
Advice,ffhcgap,t1_ffh9y36,1579929810.0,"I honestly wouldn't mind if he had the chance every now and then to call her or talk to her but I'm definitely not okay with him having access to his own social media yet as I don't think he's mature enough or emotionally able to handle something like that. Especially since with the way she's been messaging, I imagine that once she does get contact with him it will be nonstop.


They got along pretty great before but he is very picky and emotional so they also spent most of the time fighting. He also genuinely doesnt understand how to talk or behave around other kids. 


Example being that 3 times this month he has gotten in fights at school and came home from school crying because ""other kids were attacking him"" when in reality, kids were trying to play the game ""Tag"" with him and he thought them chasing him meant they were trying to hurt him. 


He's the sweetest kid in the world but is incredibly impulsive, overly trusting and doesnt really understand right and wrong. If another kid told him to hurt himself or do something he's not supposed to do, he would do it without even questioning it which makes the idea or social media really scary to me. He also frequently introduces himself to complete strangers in stores and on the streets as, ""Hi my name is * insert full name *. I live at * insert full address *. My parents phone numbers are ________ and _______"" to give an idea. (Not an exaggeration) 


So I'm pretty worried that internet safety is going to be a really big problem once he starts learning how to use social media."

That's all I've got. It was never posted anywhere, and the staff themselves did not explain anything to any of the students or their families even when asked about the situation. 


But since it seems to have been just a situation involving an aggressive (possibly special needs) elementary school student, it makes sense that they wouldn't have spread information about it or gotten the media involved with it besides on a need to know basis."
londonontario,ff7oliy,t1_ff7iyev,1579654558.0,"Alright? I get where you are coming from but I really don't quite understand how it was relevant to my comment or my post in general since I never really said anything against what you are saying or about the police being involved. 


I've been in situations like this when I was a child where an aggressive special needs classmate went on a rampage that involved evacuating the school and getting the police involved. My son is also special needs and has meltdowns daily so I am all too familiar with having troubles keeping things under control. 


The school's do what they have to do and I can completely understand them needing to take such drastic measures to ensure the safety of their staff and students. 


The only things I really said in the comment you replied to was that since I haven't heard anything like this happening at the school and they did not contact anyone about the situation, that they're pretty good at keeping things like this hidden and that they should not be teaching high school students to restrain children because that could be incredibly dangerous for the parties involved."
londonontario,ff7n8o7,t1_ff7j8ar,1579653601.0,"Yes, I am aware but this wasnt a situation like that and they didn't disperse quickly either. 


It started with one police officer and an ambulance and then the other 6 police cars showed up together shortly afterwards and all the vehicles stayed for over a half hour. The police all standing outside and entering into the building. Refusing to let other people in to get their children. 


I tried to explain it already but it definitely wasnt as simple as just too many people showing up to a call and then leaving."

Tummy issues are a constant problem, though they were also a problem before the pain and swelling started. 


Lactose & gluten intolerant, Gerd, a hiatal hernia, And Dumping syndrome (kind of like IBS). Eating anything pretty much makes me feel awful/sick.


Edit: I also had to have gallbladder surgery twice, pancreatitis and had appendicitis twice (second one it was removed) so a lot of my tummy issues like the Dumping syndrome are most likely in relation to that."
londonontario,ff4yso2,t1_ff4xi8z,1579575714.0,Thank you so much for passing the news along! I'm surprised it took so long to find out anything about the situation since it seemed to have been pretty intense to have involved 7 police cars and an ambulance.
londonontario,ff4ye5z,t1_ff4tdgp,1579575432.0,"Based on someone else's comment it does seem to be related to some sort of altercation involving a student. 


Thank you so much for sharing your experience with all of this. In all honesty, I have never heard anything about this before so they obviously do a pretty good job of keeping things like this hidden. They have over 700 students at the school so I can imagine it gets really difficult to try and manage but a school should definitely not be teaching a coop student to restrain children... Scary to think about. You or the child could have gotten seriously hurt. It also sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. 


I know this is random and completely understand if you say no, but would it be okay if I sent you a personal message in relation to this? I just had a couple questions about it that I wouldn't feel right asking openly in the subreddit."

londonontario,ff42g9k,t1_ff41lxl,1579554087.0,Yeah it was pretty terrifying. Someone I know had to pick up their kid for an appointment and the teachers/police wouldn't let them in the school to get them. Eventually they said as long as they stayed away from the 2nd floor they could go get their kid right from the class but they wouldn't be properly signed out.
londonontario,ff3y04f,t1_ff3xj0w,1579551316.0,"True but it seems weird that they would evacuate a floor of a building, and if someone had just gotten sick or hurt they wouldn't bring in 7 police cars with the ambulance.

londonontario,ff3slub,t3_er6rma,1579547960.0,"I think this entirely depends on what you're interested in. Moved here over a year ago and all the people I've met and made friends with are from playing Pokemon Go (a phone game that encourages exploring your surroundings and socializing with strangers). The funny thing is, all the people are in such different age demographics and have completely different lifestyles and beliefs so none of us would probably ever have talked at all if it weren't for the game but somehow it's just become a big ol' family. I've even had some of them come to family dinner or for a sports game (I dont watch but my husband does).

TheSilphRoad,ff210qg,t1_ff1th5u,1579490921.0,That's a really good point and definitely something I found funny but I didn't disagree about Minccino and the event (heck I think it'd be a great idea). I just clarified that their reasoning behind that guess wasn't accurate.
TheSilphRoad,ff20ld5,t1_ff1p7wr,1579490611.0,"I did state it was also a rodent in the comment you are replying to but there are over 2500 species of rodents that vary greatly. Just because something also falls under that category doesn't mean that they're the same thing. 


You wouldn't call a Beaver, Porcupine, Guinea Pig,   Capybara, Squirrel, Gopher, Zokor or Hamster a rat because they're very obviously different creatures even if they all fall under the term ""rodent"". 


I didn't even disagree with them on Minccino and the event, heck I even said I'd like that. All I did was say that them calling Minccino a rat wasn't true. Which it isn't.


If they had stated the reason was because it was also a rodent, I would have happily agreed."
TheSilphRoad,ff1z606,t1_ff1or9z,1579489577.0,Well of course but I was more referring to a Pokemon that hasn't been released shiny yet since the best part of these events is that it usually brings a new shiny to the game like last year's with Spoink.
TheSilphRoad,ff1mtt6,t1_ff1d6mr,1579481785.0,"Although I'd love it if it was an event based around Minccino and I can't personally find any other Pokemon that would fit for the year of the rat, your reasoning is flawed. 


Minccino is in no way, shape or form a rat. Minccino is a ""Chinchilla"" Pokemon. Which are a type of rodent but are closer related to Guinea pigs, degus and porcupines than regular rats. 


They are however related to ""Chinchilla Rats"" which could kind of associate them to the year of the rat theme."

I left the room and told my mom about it, she reminded me that just because I was mad at my dad didn't mean that I had to take it out on Ted Ted because he was my best friend and has always been there for me. 


So I ran back into the room to go pick him up off the floor and to my surprise, he was sitting perfectly upright on the bed no where near where I threw him. I was gone for less than a minute, and no one else was home.

I did read a news article that talked about everything that was said during the court hearing which was honestly more disgusting and horrible than you could imagine since he admitted in great detail about what he did but it also mentioned that he was addicted to Cocaine during the time this happened as well, something I never knew beforehand. 


By the time this came out he was clean and still laughed about it so it's not as though you could blame the drugs for lack of judgement either. 


Him and my mom are still happily together and he still seems like the nicest person in the world if you didnt know about what he did. But he has been showing signs of having some sort of mental disorder or possible dementia but is in denial about it so there is no way to really know what is going on in his head. Once stated that Lady Gaga wrote a song about him or that the US president and Canadian Prime Minister were having a meeting about him but these are very recent and he never said things like this when it all happened."
AskReddit,fepm19m,t3_eq48n1,1579324058.0,"I just commented this story on another post earlier today but it fits this question perfectly. 


When I was 18, police showed up at my door late one night and brought me in to the police station for questioning. When I got there they kept asking me questions about my dad, he works across the country and wasn't set to be home for a few weeks so I guess they were trying to get information from me in the mean time since they had no one else to ask about him. 


Eventually, they explained to me that the reason they were asking was because a family member had announced that my dad sexually abused her when she was only 5 years old whenever she would sleepover at my house. 
At first I was like, ""there is no way that is true"". I've known him all my life and we've always been incredibly close. 


During the weeks until my dad came home, the more I thought about my childhood and my dad... The more uneasy and uncomfortable about the whole thing I felt. Part of me knew it was true but I didnt want to believe it. My husband was even getting upset with me about it because he didnt understand how I could ever think my dad was capable of something like that since my dad seems like the nicest person in the world and he has done a lot for us. 


Of course my dad came home, police were involved, he proudly admitted to the whole thing. He even laughed and joked about how people he worked with knew he did it and it was a big joke between everyone.... His reasoning? ""It is what it is"" and states that children aren't capable of feeling negative emotions, a statement he had said to and about me many times in my life. 


To say it broke me was an understatement. I don't have trust for anyone because you can know someone your entire life and not know the demons they've been hiding. Sometimes the people you would never expect can be the biggest monsters.


He got 9 months of jail time, but was for some reason allowed to continue to work. So 3 weeks away at work, come home and spend a weekend in jail (the rest of his time off at home) until his sentence was up. Was given a private room at the jail to read books away from other criminals so no one could pick on him. Ultimately only did about a months time before they said he was free to go all together."

I brought the topic up with my mom and apparently I had already went through the testing when I was a child but she never really took those things seriously so she never told me and couldnt remember what my exact diagnosis was. 


I then brought the topic up with my family doctor, who agreed that based on how he's seen me he would agree that Autism makes a lot of sense but my childhood medical records were lost long ago so the only way to find out for sure would be to get re-tested. 


He was straightforward with me and told me that the only people who would be qualified to diagnose me as an adult are private doctors, which would cost roughly $200 an appointment in my area (sometimes the testing can take a few different appointments) as it isn't covered by free healthcare.

When we had my son, my boyfriend's mom was kind enough to help us out financially and help take care of the baby until we could learn how to at an easier pace (I had never even seen a baby in person until my own) while also going to school and as soon as we knew what we were doing, we took care of him full time. 


Times were tough, life in general was so much difficult than anyone else I knew. I couldnt go out and hang with friends or party or do most of the things people my age would do. Ultimately I had to drop out of high school but I've been working on getting my credits now that I'm an adult. My life solely revolves around trying to give my son the best life imaginable. 


That said, I love my life now with no regrets and I wouldn't change any of it if I could. My son is amazing. He has Autism (like Aspergers) but is incredibly smart, funny and kind. He does great in school, is happy and healthy though he did have to have a few surgeries when he was younger. His father and I are still together after 10 years, married for 3 but every other teen parent I know weren't as lucky. 


I wanted to try and give you an idea of what it might be like. No one could ever know how it will go for you. It is certain to not be easy but I also wanted to make sure you know it is possible to make it work with a lot of effort and support. 


That said, only you and your partner could know what is the right decision and don't let anyone try to force you into something you are unsure about or make you feel bad for it. I've known people who have went the other way, and although it was hard it was the right decision for them and that's okay too. 


Stay strong, take the time to really think about this before rushing into something and know that things will be okay. I know it's so scary but support is out there."

progresspics,fe55647,t3_ento6v,1578865745.0,"I've been trying to lose weight for years but every time I tried, I always ended up gaining it all back and more. About 20 months ago, I started losing weight for the right reasons. Not because I hated myself or wanted to look better but because I wanted to feel better and improve my health. I had just been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and have since been diagnosed with many other issues that have all been easier to manage now that I am not putting as much stress on my body. 


The first thing I did was download the MyFitnessPal app. Instead of trying to eat under the calorie goal right away, I spent a week eating/drinking as per usual so that I could get an idea of just how badly I was overeating before trying to adjust my diet. I found that on an average day I was eating/drinking almost 3500 calories whilst also having a sedentary lifestyle. 


Although it hurt too much to exercise, I fell in love with Pokemon Go (always been a fan of Pokemon but this was a whole new experience) and before I knew It I was out walking every chance I could. I started out gasping for air walking from the couch to the fridge but now can find myself walking around town for hours with no problem. Though I do need an inhaler if it's too hot or cold out due to being recently diagnosed with Asthma, something I went my whole life without knowing I had (but it made a lot of sense). 


 For the past 7 months, I've been really slacking. I've only lost about 7lbs in that time but I also stopped tracking my weight and counting calories. The part that has amazed me the most was that although I wasnt putting as much effort into reaching my goal as I should have been and ate what I liked, I didn't actually gain any of the weight back. Not only have I genuinely became a more active person, I wasn't just dieting but actually developed healthier eating habits and a better relationship with food. 


Before I could eat a whole bag of chips in less than 20 minutes and now I can't handle more than a handful or two before putting the rest back for another time. Or I used to drink a 2 liter of pop all to myself every day, and now I drink one small bottle/can and drink plenty of water. I realized that part of the reason the other times never worked for me, was because I would restrict myself from all my favourite foods. Cutting them off cold Turkey. Then after being good for so long, I'd give myself a cheat day which would turn into a cheat week then a cheat month and it'd never go anywhere. 


I only have 35lbs to go until I hit my main goal and after that I guess I'll just see where it leads but I am loving the journey so far and feel so much better."

offmychest,fdqtoz5,t1_fdqb4zg,1578674658.0,"Although I think it's normal to at least wonder about the possibility, if you haven't yet I would really take the time to read some of the other comments from people about their own experiences with suicide attempts/ideations at a young age since I think it's important for people to understand that it is a very real thing for children to feel that bad. 


I don't know this child and what they were going through (neither did anyone else really) but having suicidal thoughts and actually going through with it at such a young age really isn't as uncommon as you might think.... 


From 1999 - 2015 there had been over 1300 suicides by children 5-13 in the US alone. Roughly one child under 13 every 5 days for 17 years and with the way that technology has progressed since then, I imagine that has only gotten worse since a child might be bullied online without anyone else ever knowing... Those are also only the ones that actually went through with it, the number of children who have those thoughts, hurt themselves or make attempts but manage to survive it are significantly higher. It's absolutely heartbreaking but a lot of times, those children probably go through this without anyone ever knowing or showing signs. Or the child tries to express it in their own way, and no one ever takes them seriously because people don't like to think that a child is capable of understanding or feeling that way.  


I only say this because my first attempt was at age 9, and no one ever knew or tried to get me help until I was 12 and that was only because I hurt myself publicly which prompted the school to give my parents an ultimatum, ""Get her mental help, or she's expelled"". My dad tried to fight it because even though he knew I did it and I had mentioned the fact that I felt depressed, he told me ""Children aren't capable of feeling negative emotions."" And then my mom said that it was up to God if I died or not so it wasn't their place to try and stop me or interfere with God's plan for me."

Once the website was established there was a section with an online forum where people just shared ""true"" horror stories about things that were creepy, sometimes supernatural (ghost stories) or things that were like the movie. 


It was almost like what NoSleep is like with the idea that people were posting it as if it was truly happening and the fact that it seemed so real, kept me hooked on it for hours every day.

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fde968w,t1_fddqyus,1578333925.0,"On the topic of diapers, in cases where a parent is purposefully delaying potty training I'd see it as a very wrong thing but I'm certain those actual cases are very few and far between.  Very few parents would ever want to change their child's diaper if they didn't have to, diapers are absolutely disgusting. No one looking in from the outside could ever understand what the reasoning behind it is though unless the parent specifically says so and I honestly think the way you talk about it/judge it is a little inappropriate and misguided considering they aren't your children. It's 100% not anyone else's business what is going on in a child's pants and there is a lot more that goes into potty training that outsiders or people who aren't parents couldn't understand. Most parents wouldn't want to and shouldn't have to explain that to some random person who's judging them for their child not being potty trained at a certain age. 


The thing is, it's very easy to say ""Not a parent myself yet but I hope to have my kid out of diapers and into pull-ups by at least 2.5."" But kids rarely follow yours or anyone else's schedule and going into being a parent, you need to take into consideration that a lot more could go on with your child than what is seen as typical and it's not always something visible like ""mental retardation"" (no longer an accepted medical term) and it doesn't mean that the parent isn't doing things right. 


I'm not trying to be hard on you for it, I understand where you are coming from and a lot of It I can agree with like in your example about bonding. (Which I think is disturbing)


I'm just trying to explain that children can have a lot of disabilities or issues that can prevent doing something at a specific time that might look really bad to someone from the outside if they didn't know the child personally. 


For example, my son (who I mentioned is 8 and has Autism) talks, walks, plays and seems just like every neurotypical kid his age and even if you sit down and talk with him, you might not notice he is special needs without knowing to look for the signs since he's higher functioning. 


That said, it really does interfere with a lot of his life and has made him really late on hitting most milestones. It's not uncommon for children with Autism to not be properly potty trained until 10 years old, even if they can do everything else fine since they often have digestive issues and might not know when they have to go beforehand. 


In my case, my son was finally able to stop wearing diapers at about 5 1/2. Kindergarten starts at 4 here and one of the requirements is being fully potty trained to attend public school, but because of his disability he required a special teacher to change his diapers and take care of him in class even though he could do the school work fine. On top of Autism, he was also born with quite a few different birth defects involving his privates and bathroom capabilities that required 3 separate surgeries to try and fix. The thing is, no one besides the school and his doctors ever knew about any of that because he seems fine with everything else if you don't know him well enough. So other parents would often make fun of us/him, and some even called child services because they thought it was weird that he still had diapers when really he had a lot of invisible medical reasons that prevented it. 


Even something like ADHD which affects roughly 6.4 million children in the US can cause a child to not be potty trained on time or having a smaller than average bladder capacity or digestive issues. All things that wouldn't be visible to outsiders. 


Just some food for thought before making judgements on parents without being in their shoes."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fdd1ys1,t1_fdcoy70,1578291579.0,"I genuinely don't get the number of downvotes on this. I can understand that some kids at many different ages and even some adults might need something like a stroller depending on things they might struggle with (like with runners or those with disabilities) but I do not know any child who still has a stroller at 4 years old.  Asking if 4 year olds even use strollers is a valid question and definitely a part that threw me off when reading the original post. 


My son is 8 and has Autism, didn't start walking until he was about 2 1/2 and he definitely wasn't using a stroller at 4 years old. The general rule of thumb is that if they are able to do something themselves, it shouldn't be taken away from them  because they wont have the chance to develop those skills properly without enough practice. 


Even most pediatricians (based on experience and articles you can find online) recommend that a child shouldn't need a stroller past 3 since at that age they should be able to walk and run independently."

We have seen a few ants around the place over the past month or so but have tried really hard to keep them at bay. Those ants look absolutely nothing like these ones colour included but I suppose that is probably part of the change.


It's the middle of winter here and absolutely freezing so it's hard to imagine it being mating season for them but our apartment keeps the entire building at 80+ degrees so that probably has to do with it.."

We've had some small issues with bugs in our apartment (moved here a bit over a year ago) but we've had a decent time dealing with the problem whenever they arise and it's never been anything serious. 


Today we noticed our Chihuahua had been on the hunt and licking the ground so we looked and found a small winged bug that she quickly ate before we had a good look at it. 


A little bit ago I noticed another one on the ground in the same area and then a couple more, which lead me to find a ridiculously scary amount behind and underneath our apartment heater. 


Part of our apartment lease is that if we notice any bugs we have to try and deal with it ourselves before we can involve them in it but we've never seemed to have an issue this big before. 


With how many seemed to have come out of thin air today, I have no idea how we havent noticed any before and no clue how to get rid of them besides my dog thinking they are the greatest snack. We have literally not seen any of whatever this is any other time in our place and now there seems to be a never ending supply. I like to look at bugs but having bugs in my house gives me really bad anxiety so any help would be greatly appreciated!"

I'm crazy about Dinosaurs and these ones are so darn cute."
