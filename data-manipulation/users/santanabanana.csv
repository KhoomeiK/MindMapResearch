socialanxiety,ffbfnu4,t1_ffbfesd,1579763218.0,Thanks üòå
socialanxiety,ffbf1tr,t1_ffbem3i,1579762490.0,Thanks. So never talk back to her or some sassy comeback or try to put her in her place? You think I shouldn‚Äôt confront her? Just ignore her?
socialanxiety,ffbd24u,t1_ffb4hdv,1579760233.0,Thanks!!! Yup she‚Äôs obv been here longer (Applebee‚Äôs) but i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an excuse for her to be a cunt to me. I‚Äôve always been nice to her and she‚Äôs cold to me or fake nice.
Waiters,ffbcy99,t1_ffaarib,1579760114.0,Thanks for the input :)

BeAmazed,fej2t9o,t1_fehrezs,1579154791.0,"I mean don‚Äôt cows, pigs, chickens, fish go through the same torture? Isn‚Äôt that a double standard? Stop eating animals."
Psychic,feijyxo,t1_feigztl,1579140285.0,Haha thank you so much. We relate a lot and I hope things work out.
Psychic,feift1e,t1_feifmi7,1579137520.0,Thank you. I didn‚Äôt clarify in that aspect. We both want to have a stable career and build a family together but I am taking the steps while he doesn‚Äôt seem to want to get a better job or take any advice from me or others in ways to have a better quality of life like maybe joining the military or getting a federal job since he has no college degree and isn‚Äôt interested in school. That‚Äôs the main difference and discrepancy in our relationship.

Idk if that is diabetic friendly idk but her bf was really nice to me. I was very attentive and every time I would ask how‚Äôs everything she would have a blank face and such a dull answer. Left me $0 tip I was annoyed. Ugh I hate people. Just eat at fucking home.

vegan,fcsdnwd,t1_fcs9g5e,1577915083.0,I‚Äôve been vegetarian since 2014 then started eating fish again. Stopped eating dairy mostly and realized it‚Äôs kinda a contradiction to not eat meat but still consume milk/eggs because it still greatly impacts animals and our planet. Plus I love animals and feel the best way to show that is fully going vegan.

vegetarian,fco5seb,t1_fco4he5,1577824620.0,I was but I didn‚Äôt want to be rude and say that if he never had a partner or doesn‚Äôt have one lol. I know it‚Äôs silly to think about his feelings while he‚Äôs grilling me.

Botchedsurgeries,fclj8oh,t1_fclj2yz,1577749067.0,Yeah she looks amazing. But in clearer videos than this you can really see her lips are too much and oddly shaped. But hey it‚Äôs her lips.
