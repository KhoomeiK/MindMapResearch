comedyheaven,ffbjg4y,t1_ffbe0v4,1579768160.0,How come you have a little red *squints* car or sneaker next to your username?
AskReddit,ff9daxf,t1_ff9abp9,1579710488.0,That’s where I am with my country at the moment. Okay idiots you get what you ask/vote for.
AskReddit,ff9czi7,t1_ff9br1x,1579710257.0,What are you supposed to do with them? Plant them like seeds?
trashy,ff99gpp,t1_ff8cijw,1579707904.0,In my state it’s much easier to get Unemployment Benefits (portion of your pay paid to you for x amount of weeks) when you’re fired. Otherwise you’d have to prove hostile work environment. I think that letter would work. This has to be fake though right? If you’re not in sales or picking up clients in your car what company would give an eff?
trashy,ff9980n,t1_ff809es,1579707751.0,"Ah, I see you’ve worked in a corporate environment. You’re totally right. Written warning or two, performance improvement plan, set ups for failure and if the subject hasn’t quit by then they’d get walking papers on day 90."
