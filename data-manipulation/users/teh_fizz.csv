You aren’t that photographer. You’re still new. Assistant work means you’re first on last and last to leave. Shoots start early and finish late (not 4-11). This sounds like a scam to me.

Your sister needs to decide whether she wants to keep her marriage or to keep bailing out your niece who will only escalate.

Honestly, other than talking to your sister, you need to figure out how much you want to get involved. It's common for people affected by abusive relationships to cut ties with the abused. You don't have to go to that extreme, but it will only frustrate you until your sister starts acting.

pics,fgqb3je,t1_fgq9jdg,1581021076.0,"When black and white photography was becoming more common and films were improving in speed, Andel Adams developed a grading system for capturing an image. It’s based on dividing a gradient of light into 10 zones, from whitest white (as in no details at all) to blackest black (no details at all). This zone system is the basis of all light meters in digital cameras. Essentially your digital camera (not sure about smart phone cameras) are tuned to Zone IV or 18% grey. 

The reason why this is relevant is if you are shooting a person with dark skin and you measure the light coming off the skin, it will give you settings that render the dark skin a light grey. 

So when you shoot snow, you need to overexposed to get white instead of grey.

If this is what you think ""my generation"" wants, then you're missing our entire point and we cannot discuss the issue of work culture because you aren't understanding what the issue is.

A good employer identifies the responsibilities of a specific employee, and gauges whether or not there is a lost cost with this person not starting at a specific time. For example, it makes sense that a warehouse worker has a strict time schedule, because if an employee is delayed, then the shipments for that day are delayed, which costs money. Unless your role depends on you working specific hours (think receptionists, civil servants such as police, high profile lawyers, etc), then there is no reason to have a rigid time schedule. 

>My work culture is whats keeping you and the yoof alive and in a job.

Nope. Your work culture is on it's way out. There's a reason why all the big companies have a more flexible work culture. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple wouldn't have the value that they have if they followed a rigid work culture. 

>You're going to spend your life flipping burgers with your attitude.

Try again. Even if I do end up flipping burgers, there's nothing wrong with that. It's still a job, and no need to shame and diminish someone who has to slave over a hot grill to make ends meet. They're still working, and it's not a job to be ashamed of. Work is work.

>Its whats in the contract

Your contract is for the work and the number of hours per week. That's how it should be. 

>the world doe snot owe you a living and boy are you going to come crashing down soon because the world economy doesnt run on latte's, beanbags and flexible working.

I don't know what makes you think a ""millennial"" would think otherwise. Having a relaxed work culture doesn't mean you don't work. It doesn't mean you get to skate by and not add value to your employer. It doesn't mean you get to sit on a beanbag and sip lattes. All it means is that your employer cares about having a positive working environment so long as your job is getting done on time. That's it. 9-5 belongs up there with women not being able to be managers and working only as secretaries: it's antiquated and out of fashion. 

>learn to cope with the plain fact that you don't matter and you will be judged by how you work to the contracted hours - not how it suits your lifestyle.

Thanks, I don't need your condescension to teach me how the world works considering I've been in the work force for 15 years now. Maybe this is why millennials are so disheartened, because people like you spew out toxic nonsense like this in their direction."
