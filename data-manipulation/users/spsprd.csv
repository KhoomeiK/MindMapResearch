You should also know that grandchildren are the greatest, purest, most wonderful joy imaginable. I am sure Granny Dot loved every minute she had with you! (The first time I babysat my first grandchild, I watched him fall asleep in his crib and then I just cried. It's THAT wonderful.) Think of all the joy you have given her!!"
psychology,fegq1t4,t1_fegae2b,1579099837.0,"When I have treated people with personality disorders, I have always encouraged them to read up on their condition. Intellectual understanding of the situation is no miracle cure, but it can alleviate an enormous amount of shame and reduce the need to rely on counterproductive defense measures.

Mindfulness is a very important component in helping people with personality disorders regulate and manage emotions. Dialectical Behavior Therapy uses mindfulness and other strategies with good results.

One challenge of narcissism is that their sense of self is extremely fragile: the slightest apparent disagreement will send them into a flurry of splitting, rage, and other unhelpful defenses. The only way someone with a narcissism problem will consider helpful steps is by seeing those steps as benefitting themselves. ""You say you are lonely and yet we see how some of the things you say and do push people away. What shall we do about that?""

We can't think of any psychological condition existing as a discreet aspect of personality: people have overlapping personality glitches, mood problems, and unhelpful defense strategies. This is why as an old mentor of mine used to say, ""When you've seen one, you've seen one."" Every individual can be helped by understanding how their mind, their defenses, and their behaviors operate.

The more informed you are, the better you can deal."

blogsnark,fd4dhyi,t1_fd3l89d,1578166600.0,"The brace came from my first foot doctor; it basically just kept my foot flexed all night. I didn't like him for a couple of reasons so I found another foot doc, whom I love. Dr #2 even said I could wear certain flip-flops! (Spenco) The other guy had said no footwear that is not firmly attached to your foot. Bah! I live in Texas and often visit California. Sandals are life.

I taught and so was on my feet all day, so I understand your challenges. I confess I leaned on my good foot more heavily than I should have, but you gotta do what you gotta do. My experience was that if the PF was managed, the bone spur started to take care of itself - it's been several years since that hurt like a bastard! 

I have found that high arches and cushioned heels work best for me. I got a prescription for an insert so insurance would help pay for it, and now just buy Dr Scholl's inserts when needed. I went to a long-established shoe store in town and spoke with experienced people. They suggested a couple of brands like Naot and others that aren't super ugly ortho looking.

Any chance you could use a scooter to the train?

Walking for exercise is fine if you're not in pain. There were times late in recovery when I would be walking along and just feel that fascia split open. Damn! Fortunately, back to the stretching routine and not a total relapse. The continuous flexing before you stand is the most helpful thing ever, because then the fascia isn't all stiff and ""brittle."" It's loosened up and ready.

I really think dropping a bunch of weight was huge - I was 167 lbs at 5'4"" and dropped about 40 lbs. Too bad I currently have no discipline!

Try not to worry too much about it. No tension needed!"
blogsnark,fd26c3z,t1_fcyzcli,1578142380.0,"I'm going to jump in here because I have had horrible PF and have recovered from it. Data indicate that surgery is not always helpful and can make the situation worse. YSK the recovery took about a year.

Proper footwear at all times is essential. I have barely taken 20 steps barefoot for YEARS. 

Early on I wore a brace to bed, to keep my foot flexed and the fascia stretched out. No fun. But I had reached the point where a heel spur had formed to protect the fascia, and every step was like a nail being pounded into my heel.

Some painkilling injections were involved. Not fun.

Once you understand what is happening with PF, it's easier to communicate with your body about it and see the basic treatment steps as part of everyday life. For example, slowly flexing your foot for 30 seconds every single time you get out of bed, get up from a seated position, get out of the car, etc. The fascia needs that slow stretch or it will tear again as soon as you put weight on the foot. There are other exercises for gentle stretching. 

I had to be careful about walking, but could ride my bike as long as I didn't stand on the pedals. This was a disappointment, as I had just gotten a mountain bike and was starting to learn. Damn.

I also did suggested exercises like rolling my foot on an ice-cold soda can.

Finally, I lost a bunch of weight. Despite the regain, my heel remains ok.

It is a bitch for sure, but you can probably tame it yourself once the treatment habits are in place."
