socialanxiety,fby3f68,t1_fbxynrw,1577207140.0,"First of all, thank you very much for answering, it really makes me feel better. 
So, I'm not really a sociable person, since my childhood, I'm used to talking to those people that I know for a long time. My friends are, usually, those who came and started talking to me. It is really rare for me to start a relationship with someone by myself. 

So, when I decided to try and talk to someone new, it was really like you said, I felt bad at myself for not being able to make the conversation interesting. It's just horrible, I think about it every time. I know that I need to know how to handle with failure, but I think I'm a little bit too sensitive about it than I should. 

Sorry, but I'm not a native english speaker, so I maybe exaggerated by saying that I need to know how to just ""not give a fuck about it"". I was trying to say that I just want to don't think about this so much as I think, because I'm really tired of it all. 

Well, at least where I live, I think most of the people are this way, they just don't wanna talk to people like me, those who can't show, at first glance, something interesting for them. Because of this I'm afraid of talking to new people and being rejected, like it just happened. 

I think that the best way of handling with it is just trying, isn't it? Even if it hurts, if I stay awake sometimes thinking about it, it'll be easier each time. What do you think about it?

Idk if I explained in a better way now, sorry, trying to do my best."
