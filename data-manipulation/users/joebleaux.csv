entertainment,ffj178w,t1_ffiy0tb,1579987809.0,"If you are listing these guys, you haven't heard his show. He never had Spencer on and when Milo and Alex were on, he clearly didn't agree with a lot of the stuff they did, and straight up argued with them at times. Anyone who could listen to that Alex Jones podcast and come away from it thinking that it was a serious discussion and that Joe supported all Alex's views, needs to get themselves examined."
AskReddit,ffiotfl,t1_ffi41ms,1579979011.0,"I used to be exactly like that. It was my 20s. I had infinite energy, tons of free time, disposable income and no kids. Now I have the opposite of all those things."

As it turns out, your don't have to be an establishment politician to be a total piece of shit willing to trash your country's reputation and international relationships in order to enrich yourself, but since he's not a traditional politician and he's into conspiracy theories, he's their guy."
SandersForPresident,ff6ptcu,t1_ff5xgbh,1579632356.0,"Damn, she's just saying shit without knowing why she's saying it. Just repeating shit she heard without even knowing what it means."
SandersForPresident,ff6pfyw,t1_ff64nqx,1579632134.0,"True, I skip a lot of episodes. I generally like the mma ones or ones with comedians, but skip a lot of the hunting ones, nutrition ones, internet personalities I've never heard of and ones that wrote some book I'm never going to read.

Dude goes, here's a little trick I picked up in my young and dumb days, and slapped his palm against the back sliding window of my truck and the glue holding the edge came loose from the glass and it slid open, no damage to the truck at all."

He'd be great. Sean did an AMA a while back and I think Sam Alvey propositioned him about getting on the show, but that this point, Sam might not be big enough."

LandscapeArchitecture,fdi6ybv,t3_eldqu1,1578436834.0,I include them because sometimes landscape contractors will only look at the planting sheets and I don't want some yahoo to go in there digging with an auger on the front of a bobcat and blast straight through utilities.
batonrouge,fddp6j1,t1_fddotz6,1578320176.0,"Yeah, no shit. At least the drunk driving is generally when less people are on the road. People will look straight down at their phone going 70 into heavy traffic."

Oh wait, actually, she works for a company with 15 employees, and the owners also own 20 companies with similar number of employees. This gets them around requirements that companies of a certain size are held to."
Louisiana,fct49zv,t1_fcsz0ml,1577932500.0,"The embarrassing part is to have statues of losers whose founding principles fell on the wrong side of history. Also, the statue of Andrew Jackson should probably go too, but the reason it is there was unrelated to his fight against indigenous people and to do with being the savior of the city at one point. The confederate monuments were literally put up as a form of intimidation directed at black people in the south. What is the reason to keep a staue like that?"
Louisiana,fcswc25,t1_fcsvbdp,1577926764.0,"It's more the fact that it wasnt considered embarrassing according to public opinion when they put them up, but now it is."

batonrouge,fckdcui,t3_ehgx8r,1577722795.0,"Restaurants will often operate at a loss when they first open to generate a following. Then they decided its time to make money and they start cutting corners and it all goes to shit. I went there almost a year ago and it was very good. I went there a couple of weeks ago and they were out of large patties, which is strange, because I thought they made their own. I got my small burger to find that it is now a pre-made patty that isn't as good as the old patty. There was barely any toppings on the burger, and when I asked where the cheese was, he pointed at a tiny glob about the size of a quarter. Then they were out of the ingredients for my wife's milkshake. Then they told me they were out of chocolate. The place is garbage, I am not going back and I've told several people not to go back. It'll be closed in a few months, no doubt with the way it seems word is traveling about its decline."
