So letter is offer, would need a principal of the company to accept it somehow usually this is by signing and returning and there is probably not sufficient consideration here anyways."

todayilearned,ffulht5,t1_ffujydn,1580244475.0,and burden of proof in civil court is beyond a reasonable doubt plus judges have pretty wide discretion in most matter. They both slept with her they both didnt want to step up and be the dad so they both got the burden its not like this is a situation that happens everyday nor did one twin not know what they were trying to pull. Now if the other twin was two towns away and could establish he never even visited the other then boom done.
todayilearned,ffujh2x,t1_fft51mt,1580243255.0,Thats not how investigations work but I mean if we assume all they had was DNA to go off of then possibly they could both be tried for the murder. But US the bar for evidence is much lower in civil court you just have to be kinda sure in criminal court you have to be 99% sure. People get off for crimes all the time but then get destroyed in civil court.

dating_advice,ffrkgl1,t3_eusvx4,1580159870.0,Idk sounds like something in my early 20s I wouldve hold out for hoping but utlitmately get let down over; but games are games saying he is not ready to date but then cuddling and kissing with you is just another type of head game. Either hes ready or he doesnt want anything to do with someone that is one foot in the boat id either let go and move on or make the line obvious either gf cuddling and kissing stuff or you are friends which you can hangout but I would draw the line.

dating_advice,ffd3iuc,t1_ffd30od,1579812709.0,Thats old for the dating world just is. But good news is you only need one. Idk could try switching up your pictures get someone to help you adjust your profile other than that new people come on the market all the time all you can do is keep hunting the benefit again being you only need one girl so your friend is pulling them all great but unless your trying to build a harem you both still only need to find 1 so kinda irrelevant that he has a group of girls chasing him. Its quality not quantity.

dating_advice,ffczwaz,t3_esx501,1579810676.0,I always tell people dating is like buying a house or buying a car. Everyday something new comes on the market but those are still not always easy to find and you can watch the same cars/homes circle around for months because obviously there is a major flaw or they have to high expectations of what they are worth. Meanwhile you are in competition with everyone else in the market to snag the next decent deal on a home or car that fits your wants and needs. Due to this is a waiting game and def need a way to expedite the process as best you can by asking the right questions to immediately sift out the obvious unacceptable s for you
