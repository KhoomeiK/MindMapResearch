bipolar,fdavh3x,t1_fda653d,1578250741.0,"I do have like a pretty distant relative with bipolar, but none of my family has met her. It would be tough having family making assumptions about like where your baseline is and where you’re at relative to it. My family basically knows nothing about bipolar. Even my sister, who’s a therapist, surprised me by not really knowing much about bipolar. I was worried she would want to give me her professional opinion or something. She was kind of like “how did I never think of that?” but she didn’t even know like the difference between bp1 and bp2. 

I am relieved that I’m no longer keeping this big secret from them. I don’t think I did a great job of telling them, and they had a lot to say while I barely said anything. But at least now I don’t feel like I have to sneak so no one notices when I’m taking my meds and stuff haha. 

I do have an aunt that I talk to. We don’t talk that much, but she is the only person who has really been understanding and supportive. I went to her before I was diagnosed, and she helped me find a doc, psychiatrist, and get insurance for next year. I’m glad to have her as an ally, but feel pressure to “get better” and like I can’t tell her if and when I’m not doing well.."
bipolar,fdaufuf,t1_fda54ix,1578250316.0,"Thank you! I want moooore music. :) 

I’m doing alright. I did talk to my family. It was strange, my mother’s response was “really and truly?” And I feel like she must not believe me completely... the main reason I felt like I had to tell them was because keeping it a secret felt like lying. But apparently they already think of me as a liar... also, everyone’s first response was to ask me if they could tell. Sister wants to tell her bf, mom wants to tell grandma and her own sister, etc... looking forward to getting back home. But I’ve been okay anyway. Lots of dog walks and music! Haha

Thanks for asking. How are you doing? If you think of more songs be sure to let me know! :D"
bipolar,fcwrkif,t1_fcw7vo8,1578034784.0,"For some reason I don’t get that guilt about self harm and self destruction as much... maybe because no one knows about it anymore, I don’t really take other people into consideration when it comes to self harm stuff... I don’t have anyone keeping me accountable. I couldn’t ask that if someone of course haha. But it feels maybe like a way I can freak out and keep it to myself. No one else has to be involved in the intensity. And I can see something heal and feel like the nature of things is to heal..."
bipolar,fcw19gc,t3_ej0307,1578014817.0,"Def relate to this. I very much feel like a burden. It’s hard for me to ever ask for help, or ever accept it, because I feel like I’m just involving people in a black hole that they can’t fight against. I feel like people’s time and resources are only ever wasted on me. But I feel so isolated and I want an ally. I avoided treatment for over a decade. I talked to no one about struggling (although it was pretty obvious for like my boyfriend whom I live with). I eventually finally talked to an aunt. She got me to a good doc and psychiatrist, she got me resources... I feel like I lashed out a little in the beginning. I didn’t want her to spend any money on me. She bought me books. I demanded that she not spend money on me and I think I offended her. I feel bad if she helps, but I feel bad that I made her feel like I didn’t appreciate or want her help. I feel so much pressure to improve. I feel like I can’t talk about struggling, I can only talk about being on the mend. 

I feel terrible...I feel terrible that people expect me to get better, and it might be all for nothing. I might still self destruct, and all I accomplished was to bring them close enough to hurt them and let them see me at my worst. I feel like a grenade."
bipolar,fcw064j,t3_eizis7,1578014099.0,"Obviously I’m not qualified, but I’ll share some of how I got diagnosed as bipolar. First, initially my understanding of bipolar was intense, frequent mood changes. I no longer see it that way. Often, my moods are very lasting. They last for several weeks or months. It is also more noticeable to me when I focus on my energy levels rather than what emotions I’m feeling. When I’m manic, I stay awake for literal weeks and feel full of energy. When I’m depressed, I have to be very intentional about spending my energy on like brushing my teeth, because I don’t have the energy to accomplish more than that for the day. 

I was put on Zoloft as an early teen. I always felt like it messed with my memory. I can’t remember a lot of when I was on it. Idk if this is accurate at all, but in retrospect, I feel like it really fueled the mania side of my bipolar. I think it made me really worked up, made my thoughts race the way they do when I’m manic and I feel like I’m losing my mind. I wonder if I was experiencing psychosis. I feel like I didn’t really form memories during the time I was taking it, maybe because I was too wired. I recall pieces, and those pieces were really intense. I’m still learning a lot about bipolar, I was only diagnosed a month ago. Though I was given several bipolar evaluations by a psychiatrist in a behavioral health center, I lied on all of them (he knew I lied and kept making me retake them) and eventually I was released from the center and stopped receiving treatment (my parents are very religious and don’t have a scientific approach to health, especially mental health).  

I used to avoid information about bipolar like the plague, but I learned a lot from a book/video called “The Unquiet Mind,” about a lady who was a doctor of medicine at a major university (idr which), and she shared her experience and story of her diagnosis and treatment. The video is on YouTube and like an hour long, but I feel like it related to me a lot, and it was my first introduction to what being bipolar looks like."
bipolar,fcvy119,t3_ej0kgk,1578012688.0,"The biggest thing for my was the sleep. I thought it was like my superpower. I could stay up for literal weeks and not be sleepy. I bragged about it all the time to fellow classmates or friends who were tired after only sleeping 5 hours or something. I felt even more productive than normal. Like I was a snowball, only ever gaining traction and intensity. I didn’t really know this was typical of bipolar, but eventually I realized it wasn’t normal and that something was wrong."
bipolar,fcvxdg7,t3_ej11sv,1578012256.0,"Idk what you’re looking for when you say “older,” and I’m not sure that my experience and “insight” would be all that helpful, but I’m always willing to talk. I’m very much still learning more myself. I feel very much like I can’t trust my thoughts, even my experiences. I feel like “the unreliable narrator” in my life. Everything is a grey area, I have way too many thoughts about it but nothing that feels concrete. 

So, I’m not someone older and wiser who has a better handle on living with bipolar. I’m 26 and I’m lost lol. But, regardless I have a similar desire to have an ally, someone who could be like a mentor and who has been where I have been. I’m still underwater, but feel free to reach out if you want a sound board or someone to swim under the surface with lol.

Edit, am bp1, but was only diagnosed a month ago. I was first given bipolar evaluations when I was 13 and I lied on all of them. I’ve been aware of and repulsed by bipolar for over a decade, and now I’m finally allowing the information about it to resonate."
bipolar,fcvwb33,t3_ej1t6q,1578011554.0,"This is one of the biggest things that helped me deny bipolar for years. It was my understanding that mania = grandiose and happy and up. That’s not me very often. Hypomania can be enjoyable for me. I feel more confident, like I’ve got all the right words. I feel like the life of the party. 

Full blown mania is very often some of the worst times of my life. I’m not yet fully informed about bipolar, I’m still learning, and I feel like I can’t trust my own head and my own experience... but, I feel like my fully manic self tends toward mixed episodes or something. I get so so so on edge and restless. I can’t stop pacing, talking, thoughts racing like crazy, literal no sleep for weeks but still totally wired. I don’t like that feeling. I feel volatile. I feel like there’s a massive sense of urgency to EVERYTHING. I feel like I’m losing my mind, my thoughts fly by before I can even grasp them or act on them. I constantly think I need to do something, and as I go to do it I immediately lose the thought and memory of what I was doing. Can’t get it back. Just flies by, and I feel so disoriented. 

But regardless, I HAVE to take action. I tend to internalize a lot. I’m in my head a lot. When hypomanic, sometimes I can hyper focus and really become involved in whatever I’m doing. But when I’m really worked up, I can’t focus at all but I’m constantly activated. It’s really overwhelming and unpleasant. I let myself believe that this couldn’t be “mania” for a long time. But all the doctors and psychiatrists I’ve talked to act like my experience is very typical and textbook. So, I assume I’m not the only one that feels this way..?"
bipolar,fch2y4h,t1_fcgouzu,1577646808.0,"Man. It sucks to not even have the support of your mother hoping for your best outcome. It sounds like you know much more about what your best options are, and what you need to feel more normal. I know the feeling of not having a supportive family, and I bounce between not giving a fuck and wishing they would understand. They are very religious, and their outlook is predictably based on moral shortcomings rather than science based approaches. Appointments with people here in the US is always super expensive too, so my parents weren’t in favor of professional treatment for long haha. I’m still waiting to receive the bills for seeing a doctor and psychiatrist last month, since I didn’t have insurance. I’m sure it’ll be steep. So hopefully once I have insurance next year, it will be more reasonable and my options will be better. 

Seems like it’s a struggle everywhere, but I feel like I got really lucky with my first appointment when I finally went to a doctor. The doctor’s sister in law has bipolar, so she has been extremely understanding and gave good resources and recommendations for local psychiatrists. My city is kind of small, so I felt like there weren’t going to be any good options. But I’ve been pleasantly surprised. 

I guess the most important thing you can do is exactly what you’ve been doing: advocating for yourself and never giving up. Maybe with some time you’ll connect with someone on the treatment team, and that can make the world of difference. Seeking treatment is such a hard step in the first place, it sucks when you don’t feel like the effort your making to get better is being handled well."
bipolar,fcglw95,t3_eh7yw6,1577641533.0,"I really relate to this. I’ve never thought of it this way, and I think you put it really well. I get kind of easily overwhelmed when there’s a lot to tune into. People are talking over each other, tv is on in the background, I’m paying attention to what everyone and everything is doing... I’ve got my foot in every conversation, but I’m also not committed to any of them. It feels so chaotic and like I’m being pulled apart in every direction. I just want some solitude, it’s too overwhelming. I try to go for walks and blast music to drown everything out haha. But even when I’m in the other room, I can’t tune out the noise."
bipolar,fcgcmih,t1_fcei893,1577638657.0,"That sounds sort of similar to the kind of treatment I had when I was a teenager. I had a psychiatrist when I was in a behavioral health center, but once I was released, I only met with a counselor who I felt wasn’t really doing much besides making me do art projects that I had no interest in for one expensive hour a week haha. In theory, she relayed the information back to the psychiatrist so he could monitor and adjust meds if needed, but it wasn’t long before I was off meds and soon I quit the counseling approach altogether. 

That sounds like a hard way to get treatment, honestly. I’m really particular when it comes to who I will talk to and trust in person (as opposed to being pretty open online where I’m ideally anonymous), so I feel like it might take me more time to find the “team” that I’m comfortable with. I guess I’m grateful for the freedom to shop around for a psychiatrist that fits me. In the center, I had no say in who my psychiatrist was. I absolutely hated him. When I went back to the center a second time, I demanded a new psychiatrist. I refused to go into the same room with the guy psychiatrist and complained until they finally put me with a new psychiatrist. He was old and barely involved and not any better honestly haha, but do you think asking for anyone different would help at all? Are you just completely stuck with whomever they give you? Cus that really sucks, and that’s a hard way to find an effective treatment. Regardless, I really hope you and your doctors figure out a treatment plan that works for you. If you’ve got the option, don’t settle for treatment that’s just okay but could be better. But it sounds like a tough spot."
bipolar,fcg8o9u,t1_fcd5aqv,1577637656.0,"It’s strangely liberating. I feel like I’ve thought about killing myself for so long, it’s not a stranger in my head at all at this point. It’s almost like a friend. I know that perspective needs to change. I hope it can. We all gotta keep going."
bipolar,fccjxfw,t3_eh1wp5,1577599248.0,"I have that thought a lot. That i will kill myself eventually, and it is completely inevitable. I’ve considered (and sometimes acted on) suicide for over a decade. It went from something I thought about sometimes but feared, to something I legitimately considered, to something I felt was like invading / intruding / becoming real, and finally to something I feel is destined and even strangely want. 

Bipolar is a parasite, but don’t let it kill you. It doesn’t even do you the service of killing you, it makes you do it yourself. 

I’ve had a really crazy time lately, and small pieces of my life are finally starting to look hopeful. I feel like I’ve been taking steps and ruling out alternative options for years and years, trying to do my due diligence to try everything but suicide. My last resort was to tell someone that could help, someone in real life, not just an internet friend where I could spill all my shit without having to worry about if word got back to my family or friends. But. I talked to my aunt. She never told my family (they still don’t know). She helped me get to a doctor, helped me find a psychiatrist, helped me get insurance for next year, bought me resources like books... 

I still feel destined to fail, and the pressure to get better now that I’m getting treatment is so much. I feel like I’m a grenade, and I’ve thrown myself at the only allies I have, and I will still explode and cause destruction to everything and everyone around me. But there is hope. Even if I feel miserable and chaotic, I’m on a path now. 

Don’t worry about anything but getting help. Do whatever it takes. The worst that can happen is that you try and don’t feel any different. But, there are tons of options out there. It seems hard to find the perfect treatment, but why not try it all if you’ve got nothing to lose? Advocate for yourself, don’t settle or give up if meds aren’t a cure the first try, and find a good doctor that you like. Best of luck. It’s all a shit show, but it was a lie to think it could be rainbows in the first place.

bipolar,fccf282,t1_fca4ly0,1577597657.0,"Hm, I Wonder what a Night without seroquel would be like haha, but I never get tired no matter how late it is lately... when I wasn’t on meds, I’d sleep 0-3 hours for weeks or months and never feel tired. I don’t want that to happen again haha, so I am happy that seroquel gets me to sleep haha. 

I had only heard of lithium being the medication for bipolar, so I guess it’s nice to not have to deal with bloodwork and stuff... I’m not really sure what’s involved with taking lithium, but doc told me seroquel was a good option for me to try to avoid having to do all the bloodwork and monitoring of lithium since I don’t have insurance until next year. So seroquel it is haha. 

Would you be able to call your psychiatrist to talk about your side effects and get their opinion? Also because I don’t currently have insurance, my doctors have been crazy helpful to me over the phone so I don’t have to make more appointments just to check in."
bipolar,fca9nfv,t3_egrsdv,1577565231.0,"There are some definite, clear signs for me when I am experience mania haha. I question more whether I’m hypomanic or just worked up, but when it’s full blown mania, the severity is too much for me to not know. 

When hypomanic, I’m so so so restless. I’m trying not to be bothered by the slowness of everyone around me. I can’t focus, I NEED activity. Sometimes I feel motivated and like the life of the party and like I have all the right words, like I’m smarter and wittier than anyone around me. But in general I just feel a sense of urgency about everything. I can’t fucking keep my mouth shut. If anyone dares to engage me, I’ll ramble forever about anything and everything. 

But when fully manic, I can’t sleep for weeks or months. like 0-3 hours of sleep every night but feeling totally full of energy and completely unable to sit still 100% of the time. Can’t stop pacing and moving, it’s so extreme... food tastes like mulch. I can’t stomach it. My thoughts are so chaotic, it can be really hard for me to function. Like I’m losing them as I’m having them, so working memory is really terrible. I’ll have a thought, move to act on it, and immediately forget what the thought was. I feel like I’m losing my mind. It lasts for a minimum of a few weeks. I’m not sure if my experience is typical or not, though."
bipolar,fca4rwk,t3_egsnqb,1577563049.0,"I would have a hard time staying in a relationship like that. I would explicitly tell them that I need them to not bring up my diagnosis in arguments, even if they feel it’s relevant and accurate. I don’t care, I would not be able to tolerate it for long at all, so if they were unable to respect my boundaries, I would cut them out in a heartbeat. 

That probably isn’t the most helpful advice. I don’t have a lot of tolerance for people that don’t respect me, and I would hope that they similarly have enough self respect to call me out if I was doing something destructive to them or our relationship."
bipolar,fca3kza,t3_egswr1,1577562576.0,"My left leg gets so twitchy for a couple of hours when I’m trying to sleep. It’s really uncomfortable, like an uncontrollable shiver running down my leg that makes me have to flail it around a little. Sometimes stretching helps lessen it for me, and being active (walking, doing weights at the gym) seems to help a bit too. I hate it, but I currently feel extremely dependent on seroquel in order to sleep. I feel pretty stuck in hypomanic, and if I don’t sleep, I’m pretty sure I’ll just totally lose my shit haha."
bipolar,fca2ve8,t3_egtskj,1577562274.0,"I relate to this a lotttt. I was only diagnosed a month ago, and I’m only on 100mg seroquel. The first week or so was rocky, but there was this great window where I felt more clarity than I have in a longggg time. I felt good, but still hyped up. Still having a hard time falling asleep, and worrying that I’ll overpower the seroquel. I feel like missing sleep would escalate it extremely, and I really, really want to avoid that. I’m supposed to increase dosage soon, but I’m visiting my family for the next 2 weeks, so I insisted that I didn’t want to mess with meds until I got home. I haven’t talked to my family yet, and I don’t want medication exacerbating things. 

But I’m so so so restless and trying not to fucking lose it haha. Everyone else is so SLOW. They do nothing all day but stare at their iPads. I’ve been walking my dog 6 hours a day or more just to get some solitude and activity. If they dare engage me I’ll ramble on and on about pointless shit that they never asked about. 

I don’t have a lot of advice about your situation beyond talking to your doctor / psychiatrist about how your feeling and hoping they can make better adjustments that work for you. The path to find the right medication that will work for me seems so daunting. Hate the trial and error process. Just really hope you find what works for you, and don’t give up until you do. It might feel like a huge waste of time, or like it’s at the cost of your sanity. Don’t give up and don’t settle for something that only kind of works. There is a non 0 chance that something out there will work for you. Fight for that chance."
bipolar,fca11sj,t3_egtywv,1577561283.0,"I hate small talk hahah. When I first started taking quetiapine, I definitely felt more irritable. Forcing positivity is not easy for me at all, it feels dishonest and I hate receiving it from others as well. I want to be a real human having real interactions. Not just cordially talking about my day with every stranger that engages me. Honestly, what works for me is just fucking ignoring everyone. I don’t care if they get offended, it kind of feels nice to just avoid eye contact and not give anyone the time of day. Inside I wanted to tell them to fuck off and leave me alone, and I feel like I got that point across by being a total zombie that does not engage lol. 

But. Obviously that isn’t always possible in a work environment, especially if your work involves like regular customers that you will see more than just one time. I’m usually like, idgaf, I’m never going to see them again so it doesn’t bother me if they get a bad impression of me, and there’s no need for me to waste my time trying to seem “friendly” to someone I have no interest in befriending. Maybe I’m an asshole. But I am not a good actor and I hate the idea of forcing an emotion just to make someone else comfortable (I would never want it done to me, either. I want the real you, not the polite, superficial you)."

It’s really great, but it’s pretty excessive. I just need activity and something to DO, I can’t just sit here trying not to be bothered by everyone else’s slowness. 

Maybe if you’re able to keep busy and distracted? I have a hard time focusing atm, but I also feel like I need something to distract my mind. I’m trying to do a lot of reading and writing/journaling to occupy my attention, but I feel like it takes me forever to turn a page because I can’t stay focused and have to read the same words over and over again haha.

I think I’m only managing to keep it that way because seroquel gets me to sleep. Otherwise, I wouldn’t sleep. I feel like it also has given me more clarity than I’ve had in a longgg time.

I’m so sick of thinking about it, and I don’t want to talk about it anymore. But at the same time it’s all I can think about. I wish I could be distracted.

But calling it bipolar, using the lingo like “manic,” “hypomanic,” “episodes,” all that feels strange to me. 

Idk if it’s typical for symptoms to get worse with age, but they did for me. I tend to think it’s kind of natural for any mental illness to get worse without some kind of treatment. I avoided treatment for a longgg time with the belief that “time will heal all wounds.”"
