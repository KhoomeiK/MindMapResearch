buildapcsales,ffs1qm3,t3_eulmmm,1580171006.0,"I got the copper ones last time they were on sale and I use them for my daily commute from Long Island to Manhattan on the LIRR.  The fit is comfortable.  The sound is crisp and clear although I find the bass lacking a bit compared to my old (cheaper) wired in ear buds.

My only gripe with these (which seems to be with most wireless headphones) is the stuttering which is caused by interference from other signals (bluetooth I suppose).  

And I noticed it is the case because during my walk from Penn Station to my office, the interference happens at the same intersection everyday.  

It basically causes the audio to stutter like someone is flipping the on off switch repeatedly very fast.

Other than that, these are great for the price."
