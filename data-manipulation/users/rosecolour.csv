The next day when you're not drunk anymore feels kinda just run down and shitty. I only ate one meal because my stomach never felt good enough to really eat. I felt exhausted constantly because I wasn't really sleeping and resting, I was just blacking out and passing out.

I never really had pain, I wasn't really nauseous either. I never got hungover. It's just a gross, run down feeling and doing anything felt like a huge chore.

I'm not saying no adult can have a normal conversation with a kid on the internet. But I am saying that a lot of people use that method to sneak their way into a teenagers life so they can slowly manipulate them because their brains are underdeveloped and most of them haven't learned to think for themselves and think ahead yet.

AskReddit,fffrc1u,t3_etbzn5,1579890113.0,"Teach them it's okay to cry. Encourage them to share their feelings from a young age. I'm transgender so I was raised as a girl while my older brother wasn't. He's a miserable fuck who refuses to open up to anyone. He's always been completely unable to be honest with his own emotions because my dad always punished him for it.

  
And I see it in my current boyfriend too. I can see when he wants to cry but he doesn't. When he's upset he shuts down because he doesn't have the emotional maturity to transfer his thoughts and feelings into words.

This is the issue with men and this is the issue leading their suicide rates up. Fathers are teaching their sons to hide from their emotions because it's what they were taught to do. And now we have this endless cycle of emotionally stunted men who are burying their feelings until they can't take it anymore."
BPD,fffpsmn,t3_etcoqk,1579889165.0,"2 years. I loved that job so much but my boss also had BPD and did NOT have a good handle on it. There was way too much drama and petty back talking (100% coming from my boss and only my boss)

That was over a year ago and since then I haven't been able to hold a job longer than a couple months. I'm starting therapy soon and hoping that works out as I know what career I want and everything, just I hate the anxiety of starting somewhere new and instead of realizing that the only way to get over that anxiety is staying somewhere until it's not new... I just run away lol"
BPD,ffel2hz,t3_et3yuz,1579852566.0,"Take it from me, you're setting yourself up for a lot of hurt. You gotta understand that eventually your snooping will lead to something you don't understand that you can't ask for clarification on without looking like a stalker weirdo lol.

&#x200B;

I'm also a skin picker and I found that it's the exact same level of obsession. I realize what I'm doing and I want to stop but I keep going. It's like an obsessive compulsive need that HAS to be fulfilled.

&#x200B;

You have to realize what you're doing as you're doing it and scream at yourself to stop. You keep telling yourself that until the part of your brain screaming at you finally takes over and stops your obsessive behaviour.

&#x200B;

The truth is that you're not going to find any comfort in half truths which is only what you'll get from snooping.

Honestly, I've been there. I've done the google searching my boyfriends name, making fake social media accounts to stalk him further... it didn't do me any good and just hurt my relationship. There's a very beautiful thing in trust but it doesn't happen fast. It sounds like you met someone really nice, someone who's caring and hopefully willing to open themselves up to you. Let them do that, encourage them to do it and get to know who they are and then believe in that. Don't let your stupid doubts and fears run your life. I spent a long time assuming someone was doing me wrong and cheating on me just to push away someone who did nothing but care for me. You're obsessive behaviour will inevitably lead you down that path.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It's not easy. But try your best to distract yourself and your mind. Challenge the thoughts that make you want to do these things. Challenge why your unable to trust someone that you think is kind, caring and sweet. Challenge those irrational thoughts because that's how you defeat them. With logic and reasoning."

AskReddit,ffe021q,t3_et17w9,1579833217.0,"I was openly gay in a catholic high school before it was cool to be accepting of gays (And before it was a thing to expose people online for being discriminatory)

So I was called to my guidance counsellor on more than one occasion and the principals office to answer their questions about rumours kids were making up about me being ""super gay"" in the school hallways. A 15 year old kid being told by middle aged adults that I was too sexual and it was inappropriate.

&#x200B;

They told me that they weren't allowed to stop me from being gay but when I was in their school I was their problem and they weren't going to allow me gaying out on their property.

&#x200B;

It really sucked because I was being bullied for being gay. Having horrible untrue rumours spread about me. And every teacher/staff member either ignored it or outright participated in it. I had a group of kids come up to me to tell me they debated me in religion class and if I was a sin or not.

&#x200B;

In the end I dropped out of high school and got my diploma on my own through home schooling. I'm still bitter about the staff at that school not standing up for me and for calling me down to the office multiple times to remind me that I'm gay and they hate it.

&#x200B;

I laugh now thinking how many more out and proud gay kids are at that school now that the world is more accepting of it. And if they tried to pull that shit they pulled on me, the news would be contacted so fast and it would turn into a hashtag before the day was over."
