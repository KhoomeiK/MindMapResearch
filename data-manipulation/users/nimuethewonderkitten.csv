orangetheory,fgsm676,t1_fgqqjtx,1581087729.0,I feel this! And it sucks when a little thing gets under your skin. A few weeks ago a woman decided the station I was all ready setting up would be her station. Just walked up and started to grab weights. So I moved across the room rather than say anything.

3Dmodeling,fgrpl12,t1_fgro4jl,1581053335.0,The only other thing I can think of is the spec on the cords on the very left edge seems off. Maybe just a hair too strong?

There's a woman who gets on the treads, immediately pumps it up to 10 (maybe more) with some incline, and she just doesn't stop running until the entire block is over. Normally it's super inspiring, and I feel all maternal towards them all. Just today that was a bummer."

I think the coach just got flustered and he didn't know how to deal with such a gap between finishers. The other two groups had finishing times all over the board."

The coach just stood in front of me looking uncomfortable and trying to say some encouraging things. I left before stretching; I never do that.

Yeah, so mostly 4.0, but I can do 4.5 if I use proper ""power walking"" form. Like the weird way that the olympic power walkers walk. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3JYT_jKs7Y) is the best video I could find that demonstrates it.

As for the incline ramp up time. I hit the incline button when the coach says ""we're going all out in 30"". Maybe I get some more time at the high incline, but that's not so bad, right?

Oh, for me, it tends to be easier to keep the incline at around 3% during the walking recovery. If I go down to 1% I feel almost a sense of vertigo."
