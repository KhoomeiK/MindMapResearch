AskReddit,feh0dmh,t3_ep3x60,1579106501.0,"My friend and I went to the local â€œ beach â€œ. It wasnâ€™t a real beach, just a body of water that was named â€œ Beercan Beach â€œ. We saw a path that led off into the distance so we took it and walked for almost an hour before realizing how long it had been. We trekked through sand, dirt, gravel, the back end up a dump facility (it was a marsh-like texture when walking) and to top it off; someoneâ€™s property. The last bit was the scariest because the first thing we see to notice where we were was a home shooting range with a BBQ by it. We tried hoping the fuck out of there but we refused to walk back through the Bog of Eternal Stench so we speed walked most of the way up a line of the orchard. We realized that if we got any further weâ€™d be walking towards their house so we turned around and found something to jump over a trench and onto the other side of the orchard. We just tried to head towards the direction of where the road would be. We saw a few trucks driving slowly around but too far to see the driver. We knew if we got caught theyâ€™d think we we either stealing or messing up their crops so we ran the fuck up a hill when we saw the glimpse of a fence. I got over fine but on the way down, my friend slipped a cut down from the elbow to his wrist.
