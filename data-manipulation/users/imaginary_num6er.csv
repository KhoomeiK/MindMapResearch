You can stack lv1, lv2, lv3, lv4 shield parts, frames, shooting and melee programs, etc. Basically, anything that adds stats are additive. Leg, back, and head armor is not ""additive"" and just set your hit point % for those sections to some number. Parts are also never consumed and you can add/remove them from your suit any number of times. 

You also cannot stack lv1 frame, lv1 frame, etc. since you only get 1 of each part. (This was something early on I didn't know since I was thinking why anyone would want to use a lv4 shooting program when you can just stack multiples of the lower level)."

Stellaris,ffk5sel,t3_etmjq7,1580016793.0,"From what I understand, there are only 3 types:

1. **Forced Arc Emitter** **+ Cloud Lightening:** Ignores shield & armor and gets stronger with repeatables. Best setup against FE & Contingency. However, short range (150, 60), RNG damage output, and luck getting Void Spawn tech makes it difficult. Not to mention you need to be researching the plasma thrower tree to get Arc Emitters.
2. **Giga Cannon + Neutron Torpedoes**: Giga Cannon melts shields, neutron torpedoes melts everything else. Very long base range (150, 130) and high alpha strike. Good against most things and high DPS of neutron torpedos usually make up for damage reduction against shields.
3. **Tachyon Lance + Kinetic Artillery**: The opposite of the above where  tachyon lance melts armor and kinetic artillery melts shields. Range (150, 120) is pretty good, but is usually not recommended over neutron torpedos since their base damage is 468-1040 with 50% against shields, 150% armor, 175% hull. Compare that to kinetic artillery, it would be 195-585 with 200% damage to shields, but only 50% armor and 125% hull."
