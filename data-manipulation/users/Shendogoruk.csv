infp,ffnsi27,t1_ffl360j,1580070192.0,"I agree, but it takes a certain amount of intelligence to become self-aware."
infp,ffns9ix,t1_ffleo3o,1580070094.0,"It might be that humans generally speaking, are just beasts by nature. Desire for conflicts and bloodthirst. There are not many of us who just seek peace."
infp,ffnrshm,t3_eu4g01,1580069904.0,I agree. I also can't understand why people choose to harm others that didnt do anything wrong to them - for absolutely no reason at all. The world would be much better if we cooperated with each other.  I hope I will be able to deliver powerful messages through my stories and reach people.
selfimprovement,ffnoubw,t3_eu6lid,1580068709.0,"Making countless mistakes is human. And slow thinking isn't always an issue. There are very intelligent people who are slow thinkers. They are not sensory types and tend to see the problem from many different angles. 

If this really worries you, I'd advise that you visit a counselor. It may be an underlying anxiety or depression issue."
infp,ffirtx9,t1_ffiak86,1579981125.0,Lol I interpreted the comic differently.. but that one also makes sense
infp,ffi6d0s,t3_etoghg,1579966279.0,"Great page haha. Do you draw comics? This is unrelated, but I made my comic and want to publish it. I live in Germany and struggle to find some magazine or newspapers to submit a 1 page comic or a very short one. Do you have any idea where I could look into?"

Autistic,ffaj1tt,t3_cztld8,1579736939.0,"It's not autism. It's common for autistic people to lack common sense, but I think more symptoms have to be noticed in order to place yourself on the spectrum even. 

You are just intelligent in other areas, and lack expirience in practical matters."

de,ff3yeat,t1_ff3fok6,1579551561.0,"Danke, aber nicht etwas das Ich brauche nun. Ich suche für offiziel Paper, und nicht social netzwerking Seite, wo mein Eigentum ist nicht geschützt.  Ich kenne Personnen das konnen mir mit Deutsch hilfen. Und diese Comics haben keine viel Text."
DeathPositive,fea6tul,t3_ck25tm,1578945024.0,"I am not raised to be religious, but I strongly believe in ""something"" after life. I think all conscious beings (ranging from ants to humans) expirience ""something"" after their lives. I am open to many possibilities, perhaps we will be transferred to another three-dimensional world or another dimension with entirely different rules."
infp,fe9vxic,t3_duo1cy,1578941896.0,"That doesnt make you dumb. You can't excel at everything. Besides, math skill is not a common flower to blossom in someones garden. Better dodge a bullet by improving your mechanical troubleshooting skills before its too late. This happens to be a common problem among infps as far as I am concerned."
OneTruthPrevails,fe9tv9u,t1_fe9618a,1578941382.0,"Its kinda odd, I wonder how Vodka got into bo, he doesn't seem to fit there with his naivness and low deduction skills."
OneTruthPrevails,fe86qgn,t1_fe5r3iy,1578923175.0,"I agree ,but I am especially interested in relationship between Gin & Vodka, or what caused Gin to snap. He is such an intense character."
OneTruthPrevails,fe4xj2b,t1_fe4fs7m,1578863760.0,"Damn dude, it really feels like it."
facepalm,fdkygge,t1_fdiybn8,1578513749.0,"I have little to no mechanical troubleshooting skill, and I want to get normal at it. I think it is referred to as ""practical intelligence"" sometimes. Sadly, it is smth I've witnessed lacking a lot among intellectuals. But it may be that you just have it, or don't. I don't see how learning to use one object will help you figure out a new one at some later point. Is it familiarity with mechanisms that helps you connect dots in newer situations?"
facepalm,fdi6ka8,t1_fdhwor0,1578436631.0,Simple or complex.. mistake is a mistake. I've seen PhDs in engineering making stupid errors or  overlooking smth obvious.
NoStupidQuestions,fdc8u9m,t3_e687a6,1578269370.0,"It's a somewhat broad term. It can refer to social situations where you are expected to act reasonably, having learned basic rules of civilized behaviour (a result of your parents upbringing). Or thinking about consequences of your actions. 
It could also mean practical skills: maintaining a household, the ability to figure out a new machine/tool (practical intelligence). Atleast thats how I see it."
ForeverAlone,fcsvbdo,t3_da30zo,1577926025.0,I can relate. I am able to solve some extremely difficult puzzles and I am way above average in terms of art and psychology (according to majority of people I've met) .But I sometimes fail incredibly simple tasks by being either absent-minded or overthinking them.
selfimprovement,fcld44g,t1_fcl8two,1577745033.0,"That's kinda comforting to hear. I will try it then. I suppose familiarity with mechanisms and physics helps you connecting dots when having a new tool in front of you. Ok, thanks then."
selfimprovement,fcl3ja4,t1_fcbtzzd,1577739023.0,Thanks. I will consider that option. Are you stating that one gets better at figuring out technic stuff from gaining expirience? I wondered if  you are either naturally smart at practical thinking or you are not.
Lovecraft,fbhf0o3,t3_ede9pd,1576872097.0,"You can only escape from him, if allowed to do so.  The best chances of being safe is to be an insensitive boring fuck. Cthulhu likes to pick on artists and mentally challenged through dreams."
