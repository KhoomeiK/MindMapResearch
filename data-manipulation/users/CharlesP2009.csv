My Model 3 is having collision damage repaired and I’ve been driving a Nissan Leaf for about two weeks.  Even though the Leaf has been around for about a decade CHAdeMO support is way worse!  The stations that do exist are mostly rated for 50kW or less. So I’m grateful for all the 72kW Superchargers we have in Arizona. (And a couple 120 and 150kW too!).  And the Tesla experience is way quicker, easier and you could even say elegant!"
Hypothyroidism,ffglpzk,t1_ffgfcfs,1579909151.0,In my bedroom. Room temp and never exposed to sunlight. But maybe I’ll try keeping it in a drawer to avoid light. Humidity could be better controlled in my room too.
phoenix,fffwjbz,t1_fffoenc,1579893353.0,Can we also tell everyone in a pickup truck or SUV not to stop in the middle of the crosswalk?  Endangering pedestrians and people trying to make a right on red. Behind the stop line please!
phoenix,ffbmedb,t1_ffbf3yh,1579772556.0,Check out SpaceX's [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) service!  They're deploying now and it should be ready for prime time within two years!
