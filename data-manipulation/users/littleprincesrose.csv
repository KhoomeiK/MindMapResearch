For the first few months it was okay, but then my cycles became super long (no period between November and end of January, then the next one after Jan came in April). I started taking it again in April because relying on  condoms was just too stressful with the missing periods. I didn’t have any side effect apart from that, and taking it again went smoothly. I take a different pill now than when I started and it has less side effects."

WeightLossAdvice,feznsms,t3_eqx89b,1579459443.0,"Hey! 

If that motivates you, I’m 22F, 5’0” and 105 lbs now, started from 139 lbs in March. I use calorie counting, too. It’s possible.  

So i understand you’re discouraged, but as others have said the gain is probably due to exercise, and some water weight due to changing up your diet. I dont know the brand you used but some fad diets work so fast by making your body release a lot of water. Maybe going back to normal food upped your sodium levels, also some fluctuation is normal. I have 2-4 lb fluctuation during one day, and sometimes my weight goes up 1-2 lb for a few days for apparently no reason. It’s part of the process. 

A few tips: 

1; download happy scale app (or Libra if you have android). I like daily weigh-ins so my progress doesn’t get lost in the fluctuation, but if that’s too much for you then dont do it that regularly. Happy scale shows trends and uses an average, so it smooths out the normal bumps. Weigh yourself in the morning with no clothes, after bathroom, before eating or drinking anything. 

2; dont just focus on the scale. Get a measuring tape, and measure your waist, hips, thighs, arms etc every 2ish week. Maybe you have clothes that are a little tight now or dont quite fit? Try them on every few weeks, maybe you notice that a pair of pants you couldn’t button up before now fits nicely. Or you need to use new holes on your belt. Also take progress pictures! It might be a little scary now but you’re going to be glad to see where you started. 

3; you need to be accurate with counting. Dont just eyeball, it can mess with your deficit. Get a food scale, it makes life so much easier. Weigh everything- bites matter, dont forget the oil you cook with, the dressings, condiments etc. After a while you’re probably going to know the amounts by heart for your typical foods but it’s important at first. Calorie counting is pretty flexible but you need to be honest with yourself. There are days when things dont go to plan, there is nothing wrong with eating a cookie or getting some junk food- just make sure that you also register these foods too, dont let it all go and make it an excuse to eat everything and not count (But of course sometimes you won’t be able to count and it’s Okay too.). If you have a cheat meal or day the scale will jump up the next morning- dont beat yourself up too much, the water weight leaves after a few days and you’ll be back to normal soon. 

It’s hard, sometimes it’s slow but just keep going! If you are consistent you’re going to feel so much better in the long run! If you have any questions feel free to message me."
WeightLossAdvice,fez021c,t1_feyy0fw,1579452596.0,"I’m 22 but 153 centimeters/5’0”. It’s actually the lowest weight in the healthy range for my stats, so I wouldn’t recommend it for everyone. Originally I didn’t want to lose more than I am now, but I’m still not quite satisfied with how I look. But I’m also not really pushing weight loss right now, I’m at about a ~2-300 deficit, or even less sometimes. But it’s kind of an arbitrary number really, as soon as I’m finished with exams I’m going to focus more on exercise. If I manage to get a little more shape and drop my body fat %, then i dont mind staying at this current weight."
caloriecount,feyyw4b,t1_feyx3tr,1579452198.0,"How long depends on your body. An 500kcal deficit should put you about 1 lb/0,5 kg loss per week, which is the healthy rate for someone who is under about  100kg. Consistency is the key here. At least 20% of your calories should come from protein, the minimum amount is 1 g/kg but if you want to drop your body fat % ideally it should be around 1,6-1,8g protein/kg. Unfortunately you can’t manipulate where you lose fat from, it comes off everywhere, maybe from some places faster than others, but it depends on your genetics. You can do targeted exercise to shape certain body parts though. But it’s possible that you grow muscle and dont neccessarily lose the fat from the same spot at the same time, so temporarily it looks bigger."
caloriecount,feywdvr,t1_feyv78c,1579451315.0,"Okay but looking fit is a slow process. You dont want to risk losing the physique you have now, you want to shed the fat I believe. Which only works with a small but steady deficit. I know patience is hard but taking things slow is worth it. Usually the people who drop a lot of weight in a short time do it from a lot of excess weight, and part of it is water in the beginning. If you’re already at a healthy weight, or just slightly overweight, it usually takes a lot longer because your TDEE is lower than someone’s with a lot of extra weight."
caloriecount,feyuftq,t1_feyohxx,1579450659.0,"That you might not be hungry, but if you dont get in enough nutrients you’re going to suffer consequences for it. If you dont eat enough it often ends with binging. If your diet doesn’t contain enough protein, you won’t be able to build muscle, and you lose the ones you have. Maybe the scale drops lower but your body fat percentage doesn’t, and you won’t neccessarily look the way you expect. You might not get enough vitamins that can end with hair loss, weaker immune system etc. Starving can also mess with your growth process. Your parents are right for not allowing you to eat 800 kcal. If you dont want to eat bread, you can still get your calories from healthy fats. You also dont have to give up on your favourite foods- if it fits your limit, you can get ‘unhealthy snacks’ or ‘junk food’ in moderation, as long as you make sure you’re getting the sufficient amount of nutrients. Why do you feel you need to rush so much with the weight loss? Why the 3 month limit?"
WeightLossAdvice,feypbn7,t3_eqplmq,1579448607.0,"How old are you? What’s your height and weight? If you’re still developing, you shouldn’t try going with an agressive deficit, so the process might be slow. 

Usually weight loss is not linear. It’s funny because you drop a lot in the beginning, then it starts slowing down, but the pounds you lose start to be more and more obvious. You can see the impressive stories but the downside is that it can be discouraging if your journey goes slower. But sometimes it’s normal to go slower. We have this one body and we can’t push it further than it’s reasonable limits. 

I’m 104 pound now and started at 139 in February 2019. So 35 pounds took me 10 months, with a rate of 0,3kg/week. I’ll be honest here: while I’m committed, and decided to make changes for life, it also included that i have to set habits I can stick to, and not feel like I’m missing out or desperately wait until the end. So if there was a celebration, get-together with my friends, vacation etc I didn’t really bother with calories. And my TDEE is low in the first place (I’m 5’0”), about 1540 now, eating 12-1300 calories means with exercise still barely puts me at 500 kcal deficit a day, if at all. I still have about 5 pounds to lose and I would lie if I said i dont get impatient sometimes. I expected to be finished by now. But the thing is, my lifestyle is sustainable. If I have to follow it another 2 months, then so be it. It’s a marathon not a race, and sometimes being patient pays off. 

So what I’m saying is regardless of what others say, no one can tell whether quick weight loss is possible FOR YOU. It depends on your stats, circumstances, individual characteristics. If it ends up being slower, dont beat yourself up. I know you want to be done with it, but I’ll be honest here: if you want a successful maintenance, you will have to keep most of your ‘diet habits’ (being mindful of what/how much you eat, exercise) anyway for life, so you might as well find ways you can enjoy the changes and dont just hope for it to be over. Maybe you dont get there by July, but you’re going to feel so much better by that time if you stick to healthy habits, regardless of what the scale shows. And maybe 6 months, 10 months, 1 year down the line seems like an ungodly long time, but time goes anyway, whatever you do. If you spend that time working on yourself, it’s going to pay off."
PurplePillDebate,feya0dc,t1_fey8guv,1579442777.0,"Sorry but a blog site that refers to the people they are writing about as ‘slut feminists’ does not sound like the height of credibility. 

I’ll correct myself: I loosely quoted the opinions I saw at many places, as the general attitude. Some sites did a very poor reporting on the study, framing it in a way that the effect was comparable. I did not read the paper itself but I dont neccessarily agree with the conclusion- I believe the guidelines were different when the female pill came out. I also heard that the side effects were more severe and long-term so stopping the study was the right call in my opinion. What I’m saying is that if anything, the more popular attitude was that the idea shouldn’t be thrown away because of complications (But of course safety should be a priority)."
PurplePillDebate,fey6omc,t1_fey2pdy,1579441433.0,"When did feminists argue against male birth control?? If anything, what I see mentioned as an issue is that the burden of long-term contraception (which usually comes with a series of side effects) falls on the women. When the trial of some male pill was stopped, the most common talking point was that the fact that they deemed the side effects (that were similar to what women experience) too dangerous while it’s acceptable with the pill for women, is a sign of some double standard in medicine, and not in favour of women. I consider myself a feminist and I literally cannot see any downside in male BC being available, and I never considered it an unpopular opinion."

FeMRADebates,ferbri0,t1_fepdol3,1579352142.0,"I agree with your points. 

Some additional perspective: The Kinsey Reports (1948, 1953) showed that 67% of men and ~50% of women had premarital sex. 58% of men and 26% of women reported having extramarital affairs. (Of course, one of the criticism that this received is that the people who were willing to participate in these studies were more sexually adventurous than the general population.) the numbers of premarital sex rose in the next decades, by the 90s women ‘catching up’ with men in terms of premarital sex. It doesn’t state the number of partners, but does contradict the idea that people in the last century just entered marriage as virgins and stayed monogamous for life. Also it’s not scientific but if you take a look at literature from the last century (or even further), premarital/extramarital affairs seem kind of the norm, the expectation was mostly to just be discreet about it. 


I think what changed really is that people are more open about their sexual lives. The ones who want more variety and aren’t looking for monogamy can live their life that way without having to pretend; but they found ways 100 years ago to be promiscous, too. There is still plenty who are content with serial monogamy (that, I think is the most common form of sexual relationships), or some flings in-between, but they aren’t very vocal about that, and we tend to pay more attention to the outliers. Unfortunately I cannot cite it because it’s not in English, but at my university they did a study on Tinder’s effect. The conclusion was that hookup apps dont make people more promiscous- they are a tool for more promiscous people to find like-minded partners. 

Of course everyone has the right to have personal preferences, boundaries or dealbreakers. I just dont think we need a bunch of pearl-clutching articles to justify those preferences."
WeightLossAdvice,feqiwra,t3_eq5rjz,1579342417.0,"While I mostly agree with the OP, there is a few things i’d like to add. I lost about 30 pounds with it, since March 2019 (it’s probably going faster for most folks, I’m short, started from slightly overweight and sometimes life got in the way, so progress was really slow for me, but steady) with CICO. 

CICO is absolutely the basis of weight loss. If you’re looking to lose weight (or for that matter, gain) counting is your friend. Get a food scale for accuracy, download an app. I would say for the first few days, you dont even need to worry about what to eat- just take a look at how many calories you’re consuming normally, how much energy your typical meals are (you’re probably in for a rude awakening). Then see where you could cut. Snacks? Lighter meals? Coffee/soda? Maybe you could substitue some stuff with lower calorie food? Then go for it and count, usually a ~500 deficit from your TDEE should do it, but feel free to adjust. It might be too agressive, or if you have a lot to lose you might be able to cut more. Get comfortable with it, see how the process goes. 

But then sooner or later you’re going to have to take a look at the macros (good thing is that the calculators already count them!!). You need enough protein to preserve your muscles; I assume most of you there wants to lose fat, not specifically weight. You can play around with carbs and fat- some feel better satiated with higher fat and lower carbs, others need carbs to function properly. Once you’re over the initial cravings, try listen to your body, it will tell you what it wants (for example, since i started cutting, I usually want dairy (like cottage cheese or greek yoghurt), nuts, eggs, meat, so I eat higher fat than recommended, at the expense of carbs, but my friend went vegetarian in the middle of her journey because she couldn’t stomach meat any longer, she just wanted veggies), within limit try it out and see how it works for you. Unfortunately there is no magic rule, it’s trial-error. 

Another thing is freedom. Yes it’s amazing that you dont have to cut out foods. It’s very nice that I can get a glass of wine and still be within my limit, or have some ice cream. I ate cereal for breakfast for months, and didn’t give up on sugar in my coffee until very recently. It definitely makes things easier. However, some foods are very calorie-dense but do nothing for satiety. You might find that you ‘spent’ a lot of calories on it only to feel hungrier. And it’s okay sometimes! But for the most part, you probably want to eat nutritious food (preferably less processed so you control the sugar and fat added) to make you feel fuller, and meet your goals. It might be different for everyone but my experience is that as I lost weight and my TDEE dropped, I have less and less wiggle room; after giving my body what it needs, there isn’t much calories left for additional treats (and if I wouldn’t eat the proper meals, I would be ravenously hungry and end up binging); and since my deficit is small in the first place, if I add an extra snack or something higher calorie than normal, I’m at maintenance. Which is not an issue every once in a while; sometimes I need a break and shoot for maintenance calories or a little over. But it can’t be too often. Anyway that’s not an issue you have to worry about now, or maybe ever. If you’re about to start CICO, I would advise you to follow the 80/20 rule. 80% of your calories (take daily or weekly average, it’s your call) should come from nutritious foods (fruit, veggies, lean meat, non-refined carbs, healthy fats, eggs etc), and the other 20% can be used for treats."
WeightLossAdvice,feq7zwu,t1_feppstg,1579338646.0,"Just Google TDEE or BMR calculator. BMR is what your body burns with just existing, and TDEE adds what you would typically burn with your activities. I believe treadmill shows the amount you burnt, but take it with a grain of salt, those machines usually overshoot. 

Or just download Myfitnesspal/Loseit/Noom/Yazio, these are calorie tracking apps, and calculate your caloric needs when you select your goal. Unless you’re very short and dont have much to lose (or a lot to lose), setting a 0.5 kg/1b loss per week should give you a reasonable number."
1200isplenty,feo74q1,t1_feo0fm5,1579295993.0,"Once when I went to bed reallyy hungry (skipped dinner because i didn’t have the appetite, by the time the hunger came i didn’t want to eat, too close to bedtime)I woke up at 5am, couldn’t fall back asleep due to my stomach rebelling hard. My half asleep brain just decided that shoving bread and butter down my throat is a good idea. 

Now if I’m still uncomfortably hungry after dinner I’ll just look for a quick snack with high protein for 100-200 calories, still in maintenance or a little under. Usually it’s on days when I’m more active than average though, so it’s kind of justified. I guess fasting works for some but I’m the same way like you: depriving messes with my self control more than giving in the craving to a reasonable extent."
AskMen,fen6gft,t1_fen2t15,1579278017.0,"Sorry but this is bad advice. Sure you dont want to jump at them with the family question at the first date, but you can’t always live for the moment only, and I think if the relationship becomes more serious, the topic of marriage and children do need to be discussed honestly, just like any long-term plan. And if you’re incompatible in that regard, hoping them to change their minds will cause resentment to both parties. Either you miss out on something that’s important to you, or they make life-altering decisions out of obligation. Sure, often times people and relationships get more mature, you might not be ready in your 20s but want a family in the 30s, or not quite sure what you want but open to option. But waiting and assuming your partner will know what what you want, or hoping you could change their opinion about something so fundamental like marriage and children sounds like a horrible idea.

forwardsfromgrandma,femzaqp,t1_feknu1a,1579273408.0,"I think traditionally children are thought to be lifelong investments. Maybe the parents didn’t benefit that much from their existence as children (though a very different level of maturity and independence was expected; for example at 10-12 you would be expected to take care of your younger siblings, cook, household chores etc, that you wouldn’t expect from a 12YO now), but they probably continued to work on the farm as adults, too, and the parents relied on them for financial support and caretaking duties as they became too old to work. Also I think they didn’t need to invest nearly as much now; daycare? Older siblings would watch the younger ones, and I believe they were monitored to a much lesser extent than now. Food? They probably ate what they grew/bred, one additional person doesn’t draw the costs much higher, especially with dishes made from cheap ingredients and meant to be made at bulk (like potato and bread). Education? They probably got a basic one, or the family had to choose which child would get the privilege to go towards higher education, while the others worked at the farm. Clothes, toys?  whatever they inherited from the older children, or made at home. Accommodation? I’m not sure about the US but about 100ish year ago it wasn’t very common for everyone to have a separate space/room, so all you need is an additional bed."
AskReddit,fempfnl,t1_fem66um,1579265655.0,"Its not really a family secret, I was just too young to hear about it but unsafe abortions were so common in my family. I never really wondered why my great grandmother had only 2 children, being done by her early 20s. Turns out after having 2 little girls in the middle of war she was desperate that they couldn’t feed a bigger family and she seeked an abortion (someone in the village practising illegally), that made her infertile for the rest of her life. One of her daughters has been suffering the consequences of cervical cancer since her 30s (she’s still alive), she has 3 children but turns out she also had several abortions between them, the cancer is thought to be a consequence of an infection due to one of the abortions (since it was illegal, if she went to the hospital she would have ended up in jail). My aunt on my fathers side also couldn’t have children because she seeked an abortion after leaving her first husband, who abused her, and the unsafe practise left her infertile. 

Note: these stories are from a post-war Soviet bloc country, huge poverty and the state made breeding one of their policies; sex education was non-existent, contraception was illegal and unavailable, abortion was illegal, you can’t seek medical help if you decide to do it (According to my mom, if you went to the hospital for issues that pointed to a potential abortion, you would be questioned by the police first before a medical professional would take a look at you) the other option was to raise as many children as you conceive while the shops were empty and any belongings you had left after the war were forcefully taken away. I dont think women in my family were extremely unlucky or irresponsible; they were married and religious, sex was a marital duty. It was the reality of everyone who lived through that era, my heart breaks if I think about how many others had similar fates. 

All in all: taking away safe and legal means of contraception and abortion is not saving families or morality or whatever. It’s just ruining lives. So much about the good old days."
xxfitness,fegblyp,t3_ep0nu9,1579086463.0,"I was always a chubby kid. I had a sweet tooth, my family’s education about nutrition and what’s healthy is not exactly brilliant, and I hated sports. I was the type of kid who liked books and dolls, and cartoons, I never saw the fun in running around. PE was hell because I was the slowest and very uncoordinated, you know the kid who gets to be picked last in a team. When I was diagnosed with scoliosis at 12 and got a brace, the PE teacher decided that he won’t pay extra attention and i didn’t have to attend from then on (went to the same school from 11 to 19), and it was a relief. So no exercise from then on except for the spine therapy, but I also tried to get away from it as often as possible, and it’s low impact breathing with some basic core strength moves. 

My family has always made comments about my weight/laziness but it’s not like they would lead by example. 

First diet I was 13 but it wasn’t my decision, my mum pushed me to join her with the ‘90 day diet’. You know that awful joke of fad diet when you’re supposed to eat the different macros on separate days, except you have to have fruit for breakfast every day and are allowed to eat veggies (day 1- meat and dairy, day 2 starchy vegetables, day 3 ‘carbs’ (aka you can have pasta, bread, sweets etc), day 4 fruit and day 5 is a water fast but at least she didn’t make me do the latter; rinse and repeat). I know it doesn’t make sense, but as I said nutrition is not my parents strong suit. I hated it and tried to find ways to cheat it, eventually backed out after a few weeks. I guess I was around 110 pounds then but can’t say for sure. 

At about 15 I was also into the Tumblr scene and found the pro-ED blogs (next to the pro-self-harm ones, Ugh). It was a hard time for me, I was diagnosed with depression and felt very lonely, didn’t have much friends I felt I could trust/turn to. I had very low self esteem and often fantasized about having an ED so that I would be skinny and even if it turned out bad, at least people would finally notice that something is wrong with me, and they would pay attention, listen. I know how this sounds, I’m sorry but that was in my head at the time. In a low few days I decided that I’m going to stop eating. Well, not completely but for a few days I only ate literally bites (like one cracker or half an apple). The issue was, I went out drinking and  I woke up in the hospital, after I lost consciousness and didn’t answer my phone, my parents found me (I told them I was in the nearby park) and took me there. I drank a low amount but I guess it was still more than I could handle in that state. The doctors assumed I was drugged and I went with the story at that time, though I really doubt it’s what happened, it was probably due to the starving and alcohol but I didn’t admit it to anyone. After this experience not eating seemed less fun though. 


At 16 I found out about calorie counting. I was insecure about my body and I wanted to be attractive (i was 123 pounds at this point, still a healthy weight but soft), as fast as possible. I learnt about macros and started following quite toxic diet forums, you know the kind with all or nothing mindset. Of course at 16 who listens to sane advice, decided I knew better and ate about 800 kcals a day to lose weight fast (but looking back on my food logs it wasn’t always counted right, so maybe it was more, but I wanted to go as low as possible), except I couldn’t keep up with it and cheated on weekends, I never counted those days. I lost about 10 pounds with this, got discouraged by not seeing results and eventually gave up, gained it all back in a short time. At least I did adapt some healthier habits so I stayed around the 123 lbs mark until I turned 19. 

I was never happy with my body but I didn’t find the strength to change it in myself. I just accepted being insecure. Then I started gaining when I went to university, up to 139 pounds. I’m 22 now, 106 lbs, finally started being more active and mindful of my eating about a year ago. There is a lot of beliefs I need to relearn about eating and appearance. I know my parents had a good intention with trying to restrict how much I eat or hint that maybe I should pick up better habits but the comments stuck, it never actually helped me change, just took a toll on my self esteem. As for society- I definitely adapted the idea that you can only be *really* desirable if you’re skinny. And i got a few mean comments from classmates or other people my age who also had this view. But I also got a decent amount of attention from boys so I started to believe that maybe it’s not that bad, and i had a chance after all to be valuable even if my figure wasn’t perfect. but every time I faced rejection or someone treated me badly, or even when I felt lonely because my friends forgot about me I came to the conclusion that it wouldn’t have happened if I looked better (skinnier) so I started hating on my body again. I’ll be very honest here: the deep rooted belief that your value as a person is determined by weight/appearance is still very strong, and is getting stronger since I started to transform my body. Logically, I know this is not true, and whoever believes this is not someone I should associate with. I’m fighting against it, i dont want to be a bully towards myself nor anyone else.

Person one takes the sex and no longer wants the relationship. The point is, if I say I want X, then you rightfully assume I do want X and not Y. And if I take Y and no longer want X, it’s confusing. 

If you’re on a dating side, or ask someone out, you’re obviously looking for something. Options are A: serious B: casual C: both. If they ask you what you want, and you say A, then isn’t it right you assume you did mean A and not C or B? How hard is it to actually say you’re open to a relationship if you click with someone but also casual in the meantime? It’s not the same as looking for a relationship only. 

Or another example: on an exam, if there are multiple right answers and I only mark one as right, could I argue with the teacher ‘Hey just because I picked A doesn’t mean I dont think B is also right!!’. If I think both is, i mark both. If I ONLY marked A, then it means I thought A is the only possible answer.

A different analogy. We order food. You ask me what I want- I say I’m not very hungry, I JUST want a salad. So you assume all i want is a salad, order it for me and a burger and salad for yourself, because you’re indeed hungry. I ask if I can have a bite from your burger, you hand it to me, I eat it all. Then you look confused and say: you said you wanted a salad? Why didn’t you say burger if that’s what you wanted? Or say youd try both?

And I reply: well just because I said I wanted a salad, it doesn’t mean i also wouldn’t eat a burger if the opportunity is presented. You should have known that I will no longer want the salad if I can get my hands on a burger, it’s your fault for believing I actually wanted a salad, lololol. Now your burger is gone, the fact that you stayed hungry is not my fault, you aren’t communicating clearly!! 

Who would you think is the crazy one between us?

And nr 3: highlighted that way it’s incorrect, sure. But if you insist you want a relationship and talk to someone in a non-platonic context, they aren’t wrong to assume you consider them as a potential partner, are they?"
PurplePillDebate,fe74pqx,t1_fe70ugo,1578909972.0,How exactly?
PurplePillDebate,fe6vukc,t1_fe6qihe,1578906413.0,"The hell? 

If you say you’re looking for a relationship, it translates to ‘I’m not interested in something casual’, therefore, you arent looking for NSA sex, if you talk to someone you consider them a potential partner. So how is the women at fault if she takes what he says at face value, and if he says he wants something serious, talks to her and hangs out with her she assumes he wants to be with her? Sure, no one is entitled to anything but words have meaning and if you lead people on you’re still an asshole. Especially if you’re trying to twist it and blame them later. And if you say you’re JUST (to me, this means exclusively) looking for a relationship but still go for ONS, you’re lying to yourself. If that statement was true, you’d only sleep with people you consider as potential mates. So the person you’re sleeping with could rightfully assume its going to turn serious. 

Your argument stands in the complete opposite direction. Yeah, if someone says they just want something casual/a fwb situation at most but no commitment, and she goes along hoping he will fall for her, then that’s stupid, and in that case being offended doesn’t make sense, because he did exactly what he said he was going to do. In that situation no promises were made and he was clear about his intentions."
boomershumor,fdxc9pi,t1_fdve9gd,1578767353.0,"It’s true, but it’s not society’s place to tell what a succesful life consists of for each individual. If your main aspiration in life is to have children and spend as much time as possible with them, and you’re satisfied with your life -congratulations, I’m happy for you. BUT, it you desire something else, to win an award, publish a book or make your own company, anything career-related really, then it’s also great accomplishment and you aren’t cold or materialistic or unfeminine  or selfish or anything to desire those things. Or if not career-related, but you have a hobby you love or other goals you achieve, and you’re succesful in your own standards, then great and more power to you!! There is no one-size-fits-all life pattern, and we shouldn’t make a hierarchy between what goal is legitimate and ‘real’ and what isn’t. SAHM isn’t less legitimate than CEO- the point is, that it’s your choice and not outside expectations telling you who you should be and what you’re supposed to do and want based on your genitals."
fatlogic,fdwxpqn,t1_fdwmhap,1578763261.0,"About the cost thing, I understand that if you need clothes that are not the general size, you need to pay more. But we also pay the same amount for XXS and XXL when one is half the material, so that argument doesn’t really hold. And as someone who is short and a size 0-2, finding clothes that fit is a pain, and I have to search a lot and/or spend more to be able to buy jeans that looks acceptable (aka the waist doesn’t come up to my boobs, there isn’t 20cm extra material at the ankles, and doesn’t get wrinkly around the knees because that’s where thighs are supposed to go), even though it’s even less material than regular sized ones, so by that principle it should be cheaper, not more expensive. The fashion industry really should take into consideration the different shapes and sizes, regardless of weight. 

I agree with the rest though."
