Just because I eat meat doesn't mean I don't think factory farms and animal abuse is fucked up. It's an awful industry and if it got shut down tomorrow, I'd rejoice. But since it exists, and I'm in a situation where I don't get to decide what I eat, I'm gonna shut it out and forget about this conversation ever happening by tomorrow.
