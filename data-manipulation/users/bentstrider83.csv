boulder,ffpeh34,t3_euh0lj,1580093025.0,Get buzzed by these jocks on my cruiser all the time. The bad thing about that is the fact that it paints all motorcyclists in the same light to the rest of traffic.
college,ffpe96n,t1_ffpb3un,1580092866.0,"I've posted on r/findapath before, but got nothing in return. Either all the careers I've wanted to do are behind me as far as age goes, or I'm just extremely picky when it comes to the paths I've been given. I mean, I'm driving semis and know how to make money doing that. But as far as other career paths go, there are far too many out there that give me a headache when thinking about how to go into them.

 I mean, I've taken some career assessments at the college I'm at now and they don't seem to take my long, troubled history of failing and repeating math courses into account. I mean, more science and engineering related careers? I'll be in school long after everyone I know is either retired or otherwise.


I don't know what I tested for when I was put into the RSP program in grade school, but I'm quite sure it was math related as that was the only subject I wasn't enrolled in the regular classes for. The thing is it's been nearly 20 years since I graduated and I have no idea where those records are. So I guess a rediagnosis out of my own pocket will be the answer. 

Not trying to sound downer. But I feel this school/academic path is something I've been forcing myself to do. I mean, while others I've seen in class were glad to be back after winter break, I'm ready to just regroup again until I figure out what's best. Luckily for me, I'm not married or have any kids, so I'm not under a weird, deadline."
college,ffp9vph,t1_ffp7o08,1580089785.0,"I've been failing/repeating basic math courses for nearly 20 years. This is counting all those that I was failing that I eventually dropped. I feel a history degree is more appropriate for myself since I could remember a lot of dates and corresponding events. Both major ones and ones that occurred in my own personal life.  


The STEM majors may have more of a better outlook as far as employment goes. But I'm getting kind of old and age discrimination may or may not come into play. I'm out of the game as far as a fighter pilot career goes. And I'm not too keen on moving to a major city and taking on a desk job as my future career prospect."
college,ffp9gi9,t3_eugbaq,1580089492.0,"Welcome to the club. Been plugging away, off and on, at various college courses since 17/18. No degree or any substantial credit to my name and I'm hitting 37 this year. I encounter both older and younger students with that knack to learn. But I feel as though I've got to force myself to get through it.  


If anything, I've felt that either the ""one night a week"" classes, late evening classes, or short term(8-9 week courses) seem to be more motivating for myself. But lately, I'm not finding a whole lot of classes meeting that criteria and therefore find myself on the slow path to academic success. I guess that's Murphy's Law though. You find a formula that works right for you and the system(in this case, whomever's in charge of making the schedules for available courses) end up pulling the rug out from under you."
college,ffp7qx1,t3_eu8rls,1580088337.0,"When it comes to math classes, yes. I was in RSP classes during grade school and once that ended, college courses have just been one, mainstreaming nightmare for me. To quell the fears, I try to register for short term classes(I feel the less time between tests, the quicker I could use material in my head before it ""disappears"") and night classes where it's less crowded and people are generally quieter(I go to work late nights, but everyone else in night classes seem drained due to day jobs.)  


  
Of course now I'm finding less night time and short term classes at my current CC. So I'm now having to brave the energized atmosphere I feel I'm being forced into. I'm just getting off of work and not so full of energy. Everyone in this class is either hyper energized, or part of the early college enrollment program(HS students enrolled in college courses).  
I'm thinking of just canceling again and perhaps waiting for Fall when I could get into some night courses. Might have to sacrifice Tues/Thursday nights(lack of one night a week courses as well) and just ride it out then.  


  
No real timetable or career goal in mind other than getting that piece of paper. But with all the time I've taken, I'm beginning to feel like Murtaugh."
college,ffp6inw,t1_ffixd5z,1580087474.0,"And for those of us that have issues remembering basic concepts, it becomes a long winded game of going back to a beginning class and hoping it will stick for the advanced level. I'm one of those people and after awhile, repeating the process due to garbage memory begins to feel like a prison sentence."
WinStupidPrizes,ffljthv,t3_eu18p8,1580040453.0,I'm hungry. Let's cook myself!!
guns,ffku13s,t3_eu0jbl,1580028870.0,"I've seen some videos of firing ranges in CA where even the rental guns are ""fixed"". All these people asking me if ""I'll ever move back?"".

I'd rather jump into a dumpster full of needles."
AskReddit,ffjz6te,t1_ffjw182,1580011000.0,"Or, just take a low paying job where I'm kind of forced to get cheaper things like frozen vegetables and little meat. Use whatever I have left to take road trips on the motorcycle. I'm guessing stay away from food long enough to where you kind of have to remind yourself to eat.

Of course one thing I've noticed through life is if you're too fat, or too skinny, people start worrying about you. I've actually lost weight once in my life, dropped from 350 down to 160 in a year by doing strict cardio. It went from people calling me a ""fatty"", down to ""geez, you need some weight on those bones"". Of course I gained some of it back after a truck crash and a rejection from a law enforcement application occurred within a few months of each other. Even tried getting onto the ""street to seat"" warrant officer helicopter pilot program while I still physically fit the bill, but kept getting the run around(too many recruiters continually pushing infantry or some other thing on me). This was all back in 2008-2010.

Now it's been a decade and I just need to stay healthy for my CDL medical card at the very least. I think I'm more interested in trying to stay healthy as opposed any other goal. One thing at a time. More lifting, less snacking on sugar junk."
AskReddit,ffjl7au,t3_ett7fr,1580000784.0,"Not settling upon an ""easier degree path"" like English or History in my 20s and using it for an Army or Air Force commission. I'm in my late 30s now and was an on-again/off-again college student at the community college level. Failing and repeating basic math courses to try and get into an engineering track.



I eventually got into driving semis in the middle of it all and feel I'm doing alright for my current stage in life. But then I go and read biographies of various general officers in different military branches who became aviators and graduated with degrees in different liberal arts disciplines. I thought to myself: ""all those years of piddling around in a discipline I had no concern for at heart when I could've taken a path like that and possibly ended up much better off?"""
AskReddit,ffjk8m7,t1_ffj3sc4,1580000127.0,"Wish that one phrase would help me. But sadly it doesn't. Maybe one of those long, one man, unsupported bike or hikes cross country might work. Quitting your job for awhile and realizing that income is no longer there to provide you with endless food. Now it's down to rationing what you could get.

A little extreme. But I'm thinking that's an adventurous way of making it work."

moving,fecgwc2,t3_envqqe,1578973631.0,"Been living in a small town in NM since moving out of SoCal back in 2012. Apart from maybe signing up and taking college courses and hitting the gym when it's not chock full of people, I usually make the long drives out to larger cities about 1-2 or more hours away for activities with other people.  


Of course if travel that far is out of the budget, I'd definitely keep abreast of the local events tabs in FB. Or even check out the local sub for your town/city if there is one. Of course the only problem with the latter could be that the sub is more or less dead. I know mine is. Almost like no one in town is into reddit that much."
WinStupidPrizes,fdoce1f,t3_em9fie,1578602616.0,Still would've slowed down and looked regardless of the signals before proceeding.
nscalemodeltrains,fdn4xr6,t3_elvbpc,1578577397.0,I took a break for a little while. Then I recently pulled some excess track and a spare controller out to start playing around again. Of course I just spent a $100 on some boxcars and tank cars.
boulder,fdm0n1p,t3_elxqys,1578536994.0,"Boulder's a nice spot and you'll keep getting the complaints. If anything, the entire metro area and perhaps everything along the 25 is a soft target for complaints. I visit mainly due to the ties I've developed through the bicycle action circles, but stick to my small NM city down here by the TX border due to having moved from the CA desert several years ago.   
Most will stick around, voice their complaints and find a way to keep themselves there. Others will make the ultimate decision to mosey on out. At least the ones staying and voicing complaints are trying to be a little more involved in local matters and making some sort of stand."
boulder,fdm0182,t1_fdlesel,1578536581.0,I concur. Becoming an everyday resident of someplace you used to cherish as a visitor might have some effect on your feelings of the area. All the magic the place used to have has now been replaced by an off sense of normalcy.
WinStupidPrizes,fdg8jtp,t3_eku7ai,1578384582.0,"When I was six, I remember some older kid knocking off a bulb shaped part of a cholla cactus and the bulb flying right into another kids junk. This was back in '89 and it's still cringe to this day!!"
thewalkingdead,fdebb75,t1_fdcukyy,1578335276.0,"The actors from that show seem to have more or less maintained some light screen presence over the years. Mainly bit parts and commercial work.
