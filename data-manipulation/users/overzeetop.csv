They had double hung, single pane windows and would leave the front door open (just a storm door) during the day. It was always toasty warm and comfortable. When we bought the house we replaced the boiler with a heat pump and my MIL complained that the house felt colder. Well, that's because we keep it at 68F instead of 74F. We also pay less that $2k/yr for all electric combined (heat, cool, hw... everything). When we looked up the old oil bills we found they would fill the 500gal tank twice a year, and 3x every other years. 1250 gallons of oil a year, just for heat.

The time and effort it takes to condition humans to effectively and reliably sort trash into recyclable and non-recyclable is non-trivial. It's probably on the order of months in a closed setting like a University (I'm near one, and my experience comes from that). There are times when recycling isn't practical - it's either too expensive, not available on the normal trash schedule, or may have too many restrictions to be reliably sorted by ten thousand customers. The last might be ""we only accept #2 and #5 plastic, and green glass."" There's no way that's going to be a clean recycling stream. 

Anyway, when one of these conditions arises you can either leave the recycling bins in place or swap them for straight trash. Leaving them in place seems unproductive, but in reality it's keeping the training of the users in place so that as soon as a recycling outlet is available the process can continue immediately. If not, you have to go back through several months of re-training of your population and monitoring the waste streams until it's sufficiently pristine to actually send the stream to a recycler. It may seem wasteful, but the cost to stop and start recycling programs at the user end is actually very large whereas the cost to continue the sorting but sending it all to landfill is very small. It allows the refuse stream to be more agile and, ultimately, more environmentally friendly - even if there are extended periods of sending all refuse to landfill."

Original post (for posterity)

Okay, you're about to do \*exactly\* what I'm trying to do, but I'm very weak on the software end of things, esp when it comes to Linux. I've run unRaid for over 10 years as a home server, and there are relatively few hardware gotchas, but the biggest I've run into is that unRaid hates some network chipsets, so if at all possible get a MB that has an Intel or HP LAN.

Second bit: unRaid stable runs on the Linux 4.19 kernel. That means, as far as I can tell, there is no QuickSync (on-chip Intel transcoding) support.  They just rolled back 6.8.0 from 5.x to 4.19 because of some type of conflict when using a docker container with a static IP. I've not been able to figure out if this affects plex or not because, well, I'm a newbie at Linux and Docker containers are basically magic.  QuickSync was to be the magic that allowed me to decommission an old Intel box that does nothing but run Plex (Windows), but I don't know if I can use the beta unRaid (6.8.0rc7 or upcoming 6.9.0rc1) without causing problems in Plex. If you find out, or already know the answer, I would be eternally grateful for a followup post.

As for hardware my build is an ASRock Z390M-ITX/ac motherboard with 16GB RAM (2x8, 2400), 300W silverstone power supply (SFF - I have a Silverstone DS380 ITX case) and an i5-9400. \[Edit: I chose the i5 over the i3-9100/9300 because both i3 and i5 have similar idle wattage and i5 actually has a small edge in power due to it finishing tasks faster; the net time x wattage favors the faster chip in this case. The i7 loses due to inefficiency in cache refresh and heartier onboard GPU - even when idle\] With a PCIe NVMe cache drive I can add 6 SATA drives off the MB.  The case has 8 externally accessible bays and two more internal, so with a SATA PCIe card I could theoretically go to 10 drives. My needs are modest - 5x8TB data is more than I expect to use in the near future.  That's it - that's the whole build. I'm running the server, a cable modem, a Orbi wireless router, two Obihai VoIP gateways, two wireless phone base stations, a Raspberry Pi (PiHole DNS), and a 5 port gigabit unmanaged switch - \*\*all\*\* of which is idling at 60-62 watts. If I had to guess I'd say the server is about half of that wattage (right now it only has 4 3.5"" HDD and a SATA SSD) but I forgot to test the power it before I set it to go live.

EDIT - well, FML, the cooling is not up to snuff for 8x drives in this case. Spacing the drives a bit (every other bay, 4 x 8 TB) it's perfect, with temps 36-37C, but bunch up 4 drives back to back and the middle ones are pushing 46-47C. That's okay for now, but it looks like I may need to print an airflow adapter to put on the side of the drive cage to fill every slot. Either that or find cooler running drives than WD white-labels."

You need to craft a 30-40 second description (ELI5 level) of what you do/ how the money helps your cause, and what kind of benefit the business owner can expect.

Small business - owners will want to know how it helps the community and aligns with their personal values. That means that you need to do a couple minutes of homework on everyone your plan to talk to. They will also want to know that they will be recognized in some fashion - how will you let the community know that ABC company sponsored such a worthy cause and how can they support the owner with new/more business (banner, ad, logo's swag). A past example goes a long way. Weave what you know about them into your mission (but gently), and if it's not any easy fit (say, asking an engineering firm to support theater) point out how much of the community is involved or how important the mission is to your town/city/area. Start with the owner, let them refer you to a manager/employee if needed. Just remember to alter your pitch to play to what you know about the business - make it relevant somehow. 

Chains - oof. I'll let someone else take the meat of that question. In my limited  experience corporate guidelines and limitations give local managers very little discretion for outreach."
