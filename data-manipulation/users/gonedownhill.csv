NEET,fd6md4q,t1_fd6bbjc,1578193075.0,"For me it feels, more energetic, less anxious, a bit euphoric though if I had to talk I find it's hard to speak like I'm drunk I can organise my thoughts easily and quickly but unable to speak up properly. Sadly you can easily build up a tolerance if you take it regularly."

I'm exactly like you, feels like a 28 year old living in a 16 year's body though almost all 16 olds have way more social skills and experiences in life than me. I'm also scared of a family member dying ie getting ill."
NEET,fcv79ck,t3_eiziou,1577996104.0,Yeah on my phone and mostly on tablet. My PC is so old so it's easier this way.

I have a method that's pretty much closer to 100 percent of succeding, I still have to find the courage to go through with it. That's why I said suicide is the only motivation that keeps me going, I hope I clarified that for you :)."
socialanxiety,fcurzil,t1_fctw9gx,1577987308.0,I hope you will get the right things that will work for you :).
NEET,fcurkgv,t1_fcu2ub0,1577987057.0,It's the same with me too. I feel like the  memories of bad things have taken over the few good things happened in the past. But you're just starting over you will certainly be able to change this bad habit. Good luck to you!
socialanxiety,fctvm7i,t1_fctus6u,1577961828.0,I'm sorry you haven't found a good therapist yet. Have you considered seeing a psychiatrist though? Or getting medication?

NEET,fcsn0xk,t1_fcrwee3,1577920069.0,"How can you explain abstract concepts like infinity, zero, gravitation, most concepts found in religions? You can't really explain them with concrete ideas, you only can describe them or illustrate them, give paradigms."
socialanxiety,fcslydz,t1_fcs0svm,1577919352.0,"Medication will most likely work for you. They just don't for me. I read that some people have treatment resistant depression maybe I am one of them. I've been on snri, ssri and tricycle antidepressants so far. Been on Venlafaxine, Fluoxetine, Citalopram, Escitalopram, Sertraline, Paroxetine, Amitriptyline that were the only ones I could think of. And especially for anxiety; Clonazepam, Alprazolam, Lorazepam. Propranolol and Pregabalin. Out of all those medications only clonazepam and pregabalin were the ones helped me with my anxiety at least. But unfortunately they built up a tolerance really quickly and also they could be addictive. I don't also live in the USA and seeing psychiatrists isn't really something most people would do. I know the people in my town who know me and my relatives think that I'm just lazy, not mentally ill. I hope things work out well for you. You should consider seeing a psychiatrist or a therapist ( though I'm not really sure if they are licensed for prescribing drugs, I could be wrong though), medication will most likely help you like they help millions of people."
NEET,fcqqm26,t3_eidnyc,1577890641.0,"I'm really sorry for you. I think I can imagine how life must have been for you over the years, but I don't think I can ever truly imagine. Words don't mean much, but I wish you all the best and I hope you find peace with whatever you decide."
NEET,fcpe2cy,t3_ei7f9k,1577860023.0,"You didn't waste 2019 OP. You got diagnosed, got into therapy, medication, enrolled into school etc. For me, those are some big achievements, especially enrolling into school. Maybe you're felling little down because in hindsight you only remember the bad parts, but there's a lot of improvements and definitely a lot of good parts in 2019 for you."

socialanxiety,fcp6x67,t1_fcp5cod,1577852483.0,"I've been depressed since I was a kid diagnosed that I was clinically depressed when I was 17. I also suffer from severe social anxiety ( struggled with agoraphobia for years). I'm 28 now with no positive change, never had a single friend, a girlfriend or any normal experience at any point in my life. I tried ending my life at 21,23 and 28 and obviously failed. I'm too jaded and tired to wanting anything out of life or even knowing what I want. I think I can say I tried  I really tried to get better for years, psychiatrists, so many medications etc. None of them worked. I'm just too broken and really really tired :)."
socialanxiety,fcp4qdt,t1_fcp2x2n,1577850411.0,"Yes you're probably right and maybe it is true for many. But for me, it takes tremendous courage to end it. And friend, everything you said after the first line are just platitudes to me, no offence."
NEET,fcp4bdx,t1_fcp1x4s,1577850045.0,"I don't think I said you can't explain concepts. Heaven is just an abstract concept created by humans, you can interprete it anyway you can. But if someone articulate that heaven really exists or they can even go explaining what it's like, that's a lie to me, you can't explain abstract concepts using concrete ones. If heaven exists they have to prove it without using any human concepts. Heaven or any other thing that we can talk about ( like afterlife) are just concepts. If really think about it everything is created by mind, there's only ""nothingness"" without mind."

NEET,fcp1m7i,t3_eic5mj,1577847695.0,"No. Every concept is human mind's construct, even the ""concept"" itself. God, karma, nirvana, afterlife etc are all just creations of human mind. No one knows what happenes after we die. If someone ""knows"" they can't explain it to someone else because they won't be able to explain it using words, art, music etc because they are all concepts.

Buddha said "" everything in this world is an illusion, a mind's creation even the mind itself"". In his religion he mentions""nirvana"" many times, but never tried to explain it. I don't know anyone can make any sense of what I wrote, sorry."

socialanxiety,fcna6kf,t1_fcmpfg0,1577807177.0,"That isn't stupid at all. I've had been seen quite a few psychiatrists in the past couple of years. None of them were any help though. I met one that was at least a bit helpful since last year and I've been seen him once every month. So far I've been on so many medications but none of them worked on my clinical depression and severe social anxiety. I'm still on medication but they don't help me with my issues.

Last day of the year is just another day for me like the next day or a day on any month :). I really hate going for a new year, a new decade with all my baggage. But thanks for wishing me a nice last day of the year, I hope you the same. Good for you that you have a great therapist and a support group for your social anxiety. 16 was the year things got really bad for me and it all went downhill well since then, its kind of staggering I'm still around. I hope the next year is going going to be great for you and good luck! :)."
