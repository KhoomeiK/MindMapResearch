offmychest,ff90gjx,t3_es81y1,1579701686.0,"This post reminds me of something I read from a really great book;
Love is a verb, not a feeling. You love someone by serving them, appreciating them, making sacrifices for them, gratifying them, basically doing all those little loving acts that strengthen a relationship and the bond between you two. Love, the feeling, is a fruit of love, the verb. You get that sweet reward after acting on your love, it‚Äôs not something that just pops up randomly. 

I‚Äôm really happy for you! I hope your relationship continues to grow and flourish and you get to experience that feeling more and more :)"

I had lost more than 10kgs at that time, and she, being my own TRAINER, didn‚Äôt even acknowledge it, let alone congratulate me for it, no, she fucking says I GAINED WEIGHT?

feemagers,fdn8nbw,t3_em3q5y,1578580228.0,"That sounds so unfortunate, I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you.

I hope you don‚Äôt think that this determines you though, because even though it is probably hard, you *can* get better if you choose to. Don‚Äôt give up. No one can choose what they‚Äôre born into, but everyone can choose what they become. You are not forever determined by this unfortunate situation. 

Starting small is always the best first step. Do something relatively easy to you everyday that would help you raise your independence (maybe doing a small chore at home, or cooking a meal, picking up a hobby, or anything not too hard you believe would help) and stick to it. Make your own choices. Think for yourself, not your dad or the people around you. You have the freedom of choice, no one can take that away from you. 

I really recommend you read the book ‚ÄòThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective People‚Äô by Stephen R Covey, I just got done with the first habit and it already impacted me a lot. I hope it helps you out! :)"
feemagers,fdn79j3,t3_em8vzy,1578579215.0,"Learn to appreciate and love yourself. The things you do, the way you act, the minor physical details in your appearance. 

Look at yourself with compassion, not criticism.

Treat yourself the way you‚Äôd treat a close loved one. 

Make sacrifices for yourself. Take time to care for yourself and do something you love and enjoy.

*Understand* yourself. 

When you find weaknesses, work on improving them on the basis of your love for yourself, for becoming a better version of yourself, not to make yourself ‚Äòless awful‚Äô.

Don‚Äôt scrutinize your mistakes, instead acknowledge them, correct them, and learn from them the moment they happen. 

You aren‚Äôt perfect, no one is, so don‚Äôt berate yourself for not being so.

It will take time and effort, but it‚Äòll be so worth it in the end for the confidence and self-esteem you‚Äôll gain. I wish you luck!"

feemagers,fcscb1j,t1_fcrx7ej,1577914538.0,"I understand how frustrating such things can be, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you still cannot do what you need to be a better person. In the end, the choice lies with you. What you‚Äôre essentially saying is that all these environmental factors are controlling you, that you have no choice over your own response or decisions, which is false. 

When I said the problem lies with you, I was talking about your perspective of things. Right now, I assume you see it as ‚Äúmy parents do xyz, so I cannot choose to do xyz‚Äù, which is the exact problem. Once you start seeing it as ‚Äúmy parents do xyz, but I can still choose to do xyz to become a better person myself‚Äù, then you can fix it!

Please don‚Äôt be offended by what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm just giving advice, whether received or ignored is up to you. Again, it is your choice!"

You said you want your friends to make you feel good and always include you in activities and care for you, but that might be really hard to get if you only expect it of *them*. ‚ÄúBe the change you want to see in the world.‚Äù Most people want the exact same thing you want in others, yet they don‚Äôt even try doing it themselves, so they go around looking for something in people they don‚Äôt even have in the first place.

Then again, you might have just worded it wrongly and it‚Äôs not really what you do lol. But if it‚Äôs true, try to apply it to yourself a bit and you‚Äôll see how all your relationships will become so much better. Just don‚Äôt do it with an expectation of it getting reciprocated right away, because that might disappoint you. Do it out of your own good will and eventually, the genuine people will return it"

getdisciplined,fc28x12,t3_eflbm1,1577346105.0,"Look at your character and perspective first. To build a habit of doing something, you need to have the knowledge (the *what* and *why*), the skill (the *how*) and the desire (the *want*). Assuming you already know the what and why, and the how, you need the _want_. This desire shouldn‚Äôt stem from temporary benefit, like the short-term pleasure you may get from watching TV or playing video games, no, it should be from _eventual_ benefits. For example, I workout because _eventually_, I *want* to have a fit body. So why do you want to study? To get good grades in the future, pass your classes and get your degree right? Through that, build the habit. 

Don‚Äôt look at it as a chore, like a ‚ÄúI *have* to do this‚Äù. Look at it as a choice, because your own basic character would prefer the consequences of this choice, over the consequences of not doing it. You *choose* to do it. You know why, you know how, and you know you want to. So do it."

An example of a principle is one like OP said, the principle of service, or fairness, honesty, growth, excellence and quality, etc, etc. If you base your paradigm on all these principles, from deep within, then you‚Äôll see a great difference in attitude and behavior.
