Parenting,fglfltk,t1_fglf6b5,1580895227.0,"I did read it.  I know my opinion is unpopular and that’s fine, but OP does way too much talking about her own personal suffering, and those items as I rather rudely pointed out, are extremely minor in nature.  

Her daughter needing help and OP being bitter because it is during a holiday she enjoys?  If the daughter had a medical issue like a broken leg it would be unthinkable to assert she did it on purpose to ruin a holiday.  And if the daughter truly has mental health issues, it’s the same as a broken leg in terms of how much control the daughter has.  

I think the dad and the sons play the role of rescuer.  But also in drama triangle land, the participants move around the triangle, swapping roles to reinforce the triangle.  So I am certain the mother is persecutor and rescuer from time to time, as I think she’s driving this triangle."
Parenting,fgld6h2,t1_fgkxh54,1580891723.0,"You’re the only one that gets it apparently.  OP is the abuser here.  If you ever wondered what the other side of /r/raisedbynarcissists would sound like, this is it. 

“I can’t even install candy crush, I must live on $5 a year for my personal toiletries oh boohoo I am being abused oh boohoo”

The entire screed is about her own suffering, like a victim, not a problem solving parent.  Absolutely incapable of having boundaries with a child.  “Oh I suffer through terrible tv shows for her boohoo!”  Oh good lord, I have a toddler who is “abusing” me with baby shark then. 

The drama triangle requires a persecutor, a victim, and a rescuer.  OP is trying to recruit the internet (likely because friends and therapists are sick of listening) into being the rescuer to validate her role as victim.  

That poor daughter, being forced to participate in a dysfunctional relationship and being painted as abusive."
