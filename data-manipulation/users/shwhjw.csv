The first driver I tried turned out to be a beta driver and I got some black screens, changed to a stable driver and been fine since. After setting a custom fan curve it never gets beyond ~80 degrees, although admittedly I'm not driving it 100% as i'm only on FHD/60Hz."

I guess there's no harm in pre-ordering then cancelling if I buy another beforehand?

With all the ""problems"" of much more expensive monitors (backlight bleeding, signal loss, overshoot, uniformity), how can I trust the quality of the Eve Spectrum, a manufacturer I've never seen a monitor from previously? Is development and quality control really going to be better than (or as good as) the big brands'?"

As a Brit, I found it genuinely disheartening to think that people watch that dumbed-down misleading shit and think it makes serious valid arguments.

Sorry, I needed to share my pain as I would have 100% gone for that, but realised too late. Hopefully it'll come down again soon, or the 850 will be available for a sensible price."

nextfuckinglevel,fdzt209,t3_enddmz,1578795130.0,"Sure it looks pretty, but in my experience driving sims really need some motion to the cockpit, otherwise it just feels like you're ""sliding"" around. Nothing more immersion-breaking than slamming on the brakes, expecting to be flung forward, but instead you slowly glide to a stop.

But I guess anyone wanting a sim on this level has to do it in stages. Maybe the motion is their next investment."
