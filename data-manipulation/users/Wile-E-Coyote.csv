MadeMeSmile,ffb8y99,t1_ffb8e1t,1579755532.0,It's also a very smart move if they love the art. Their main advertising is word of mouth and showing off the work so even if they have to wait a little bit that person would be more likely to return for future work and recommend the artist to others.

Those were some bad times but the guys there helped me through it and not through selling booze. I would usually hang out for a bit since it would be their slow time and chat. They never preached but were always willing to talk if it was slow and would just give a ""Hey man, you may want to take it easy"" when it was needed."

dresdenfiles,fezsyi3,t3_eqfprj,1579461251.0,"Remember the fight at the aquarium. She was able to keep multiple strong practitioners subdued but even Dresden remarks on how she is not overpowering them just keeping them at bay. Ivy had to focus everything on just stopping Tessa when she was attacking. Tessa would be the closest comparison to Ivy in terms of experience so I would say that would mean their raw strength would have to be comparable as well. That seems to mean she would be council level but not near the top, in terms of raw power. There is a lot to be said about experience however."
dresdenfiles,fezof0n,t1_femhxdl,1579459661.0,"Well considering this is Butcher we are talking about I'm imagining a threat where there will be a line along the lines of ""Therapy is easier than necromancy"" while trying to justify bargaining with Mab for Maggie's protection.

UnethicalLifeProTips,fej6xw5,t1_feivct9,1579159446.0,As someone working for a trash company they make life hell for us too. I really hate it when I get a call about a missed pickup and see a scavenger's truck in front of the container in the picture the driver took. That's not even getting into bulky items or hazardous waste people love to throw into dumpsters thinking that in such a large load it won't be a problem.
UnethicalLifeProTips,fej6mbm,t1_feiwpnx,1579159042.0,"It depends on where you are, in some areas there can be overage charges. More than anything it may lead to an extra pickup which in my experience always has a charge and for most dumpsters that can be $250-500."

If it was done by an executive order to shut it down then it could be contested as a violation of Congress's powers granted in the commerce clause, but it may go through if it just cuts out all current funding say pending an environmental impact review.

Yes, sometimes people could have done a better job driving. Other times, it was not in their control at all. Either way, their PTSD is valid.

I catch flack from not driving all the time and hate telling people why. Every time I get behind the wheel I remember my last accident and the feeling of the airbag deploying then the car rolling.

Futurama however would still work. The only problem is they seemed to run out of steam with the last season they did.
