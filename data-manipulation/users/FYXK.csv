OurPresident,ffee7c0,t1_ffedlkj,1579844712.0,"Completely agree! I love Bernie, and if I were American I would definitely be voting for, if not campaigning for him. I’m just saying that, from a more global perspective, his policies seem far more common-sense than left-wing - but that’s not to say he isn’t. All I’m saying is that I think it would be impossible for a presidential candidate to be genuinely radical and still have a shot. There’s way too much other stuff to fix first. America needs to stop being backwards before it can be truly progressive."
OurPresident,ffeck4t,t1_ffe7k8s,1579843135.0,"Not American, but a lot of Bernie’s policies that SEEM really left to Americans are just common sense in most of the developed world.

That said, I’m not aware of anything he’s said that necessarily precludes him from being further left than his current policies. Maybe he’s just playing it smart? He probably wouldn’t have a chance of getting elected in the US if he was radically left-wing, and realistically, implementing a bunch of basic shit like m4a is a priority."

LateStageCapitalism,ff24szz,t1_ff10loa,1579493818.0,"The difference in the level of skill makes one a lot more replaceable than the other, and therefore less valuable. That’s why one gets paid a lot more than the other. I don’t think it’s particularly useful to insist that they’re exactly the same while ignoring all nuance.

I’m not saying they’re not both workers, but one has a lot more freedom and potential for mobility than the other."

australia,fe12akm,t1_fe0lnak,1578821732.0,"I'm in Melbourne too, and I can't believe how bad the smoke has been here some days. There was a day when you couldn't even see buildings the next suburb over - and we aren't even particularly close to any major fires. I can't imagine what it's like to be living in a rural area right now. There needs to be more being done to help these people."
