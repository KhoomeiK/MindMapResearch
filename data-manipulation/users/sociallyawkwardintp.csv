progresspics,ffardwi,t3_esf9mm,1579742718.0,"I used to have an all or nothing mentality where if I wasn't doing everything right I'd lose motivation and give up. Now what I do is if I feel like I'm losing motivation then I still go to the gym, even if I don't feel like it, and tell myself to just do your best. That really helps me the next day then because I'm still in routine and you can build on that success. It's the constant missing of gym days and making bad food choices that makes me lose motivation, but if it's one cheat meal me one day off that's fine. It's just really important for me to stay in routine even if my workout isn't amazing. Consistency beats perfection, always a good phrase to remember."
