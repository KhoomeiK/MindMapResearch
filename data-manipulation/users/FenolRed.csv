AmItheAsshole,fff0n7i,t3_et07oe,1579872394.0,"NTA  I hate dealing with people like your brother and his girlfriend. Because of my surname a lot of people assume I'm Jewish and I've seen the face of disgust when I tell people like your brother that I'm not. I think it's just their excuse to be openly ""racist""(I know it's not about race but  I don't know what to call this behavior)."

People should leave their jewelery at home (unless you are staying at an all inclusive and never leave the complex) because it will be stolen. People from first world countries are known as easy targets here.

Now, no one is going to steal a wedding band unless it's ostentatious."

AmItheAsshole,fc8lln9,t3_egkdrc,1577537454.0,"NTA and if I were you, I would try and find her a psychiatrist ASAP. My father is bipolar. He likes to buy things when he is having a manic episode, mostly useless crap. Ever since he's been on treatment, it has gotten better but still happens from time to time. Expect her to refuse treatment because that's a symptom. 
The only way my mother convinced my father to take his medication was by threatening that he wouldn't see us if he wasn't on treatment. Mental illnesses are harsh."
