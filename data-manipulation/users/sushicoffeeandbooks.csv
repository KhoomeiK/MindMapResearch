cats,fajia21,t3_e9cv1y,1576139071.0,"This happened to me when I adopted my two boys Niffler and Bagheera. We came to see Bagheera after seeing him on the shelter website but he was sharing a kennel with Niffler as they were rescued from the same house. They were being advertised separately but they were so so close I couldn’t bare spilt them so I got them both. Best thing I have ever done. I love them both very much.

Your boys are absolutely beautiful! I’m sure you’ll all bring each other many happy years."
