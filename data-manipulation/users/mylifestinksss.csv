I am also a lover. But unfortunately, that kind of thing isn't rewarded. I want affection but you have to jump through so many hoops to get it that it becomes not worth the trouble.

It really sucks when you know that there are people who have no where near the education and skills you do, but they have a better life because they were not traumatized."
depression,ffh3j0c,t3_ethgqo,1579922130.0,"marriage - lol. it makes me very depressed to realize that marriage isn't about love at all, it's about convenience and how people always want to move up the ladder. It is nothing more than a financial contract. 

kids - lol.  i don't want some kid to be traumatized the way i was

u/NoReason87 is completely right. The fact that society dictates what you should do is incredibly depressing when you know you are not like others. Having children is going to be a disaster for many people. Mental health problems, increasing costs of everything, lack of basic services, etc etc. 

My parents had children because they wanted to fit in society but our family is a total mess.  We are a laughingstock. I think people actually pity us because of how inferior we are."

Also, that's not likely to change someone's mind. If they are in pain, thinking of others missing them won't end the pain.

depression,fdeeko9,t3_ekwbox,1578337319.0,"Yes. 

For me, getting better wont really lead to anything because I am pretty much a gone case. It cannot bring back all the time i lost due to depression (which were some of my prime years). At this point, even if i do get ""better"", i will have to rebuild again which takes a lot of time and effort. I am like you in that I don't want anything in life. Some people were lucky and got off to a great start, and have a lot to live for. As you get older life gets more complicated. I'm not the kind of person that likes complexity. I went through many years being alone, and depressed."
depression,fdedlow,t3_ekqsl7,1578336710.0,at your age i was extremely lonely. i had no one. i was really weird. working out was the only things that helped me. and music.

but i understand what you mean. you feel like you have no future, yet too afraid to kill yourself. it's a feeling that not many will understand."
depression,fd6clal,t3_ejsoej,1578188911.0,"i know. 

no one can see your pain, which isn't necessarily their fault. but, what bothers me is if someone has cancer, people cant necessarily see that either yet everyone rallies around that person and they don't have to hide it from the world.

lets face it. saying you have severe depression is taboo. people will pity you at best. they won't sympathize especially if they dont have mental illness."
depression,fd6c2o7,t3_ejw74l,1578188686.0,"You seem mature beyond your years. At least you know what adulthood is like. At your age, I will still obsessed with video games and thought it would always be like that. 

There is a small subsection of people who were able to make it in something they are really passionate about (acting, etc). They probably have really nice lifestyles. Other than that the average person is working an average job.   


For me, I actually did enjoy my early 20's. You should look into therapy and try to make a 5 year plan. You are WAY too young to be giving up."
depression,fczz1o5,t3_ejosz9,1578111091.0,"i feel you man. everyone in my dad's family was bad at life too. most people died early. my grandfather died early because he got sick and didnt want to live anymore. when you're not good at life, you probably feel lonely, right?"
depression,fczyuue,t3_ejpc4i,1578110993.0,"yeah, if you're not getting girls now it will probably get harder as you get older unless you realize somethings now. look up red pill, watch pick up artist videos, and read the game. you can change things around. you're just too nice and not assertive enough now and if you're feeling suicidal you will never get a goal. show some dominance, LEAD, be funny, and act like you don't give a shit. if you're falling head over heels for a girl, you're doing it the wrong way. if you want a better future, start lifting heavy and have interests outside of girls."
depression,fczydw2,t3_ejdj5b,1578110758.0,"I am extremely afraid of the pain, not about what happens after I die. I have a low pain threshold.  


Here's the thing - why am I so afraid of the pain, if I know that the pain of living longer will be even worse? I know I'm not really going to get better. I have envisioned scenarios in which I'm successful in going about it, but I can't really get myself to try it. I think I'm really a coward."
depression,fczxqpj,t3_ejockg,1578110431.0,"i was put on a 72 hour hold after my suicide attempt, but never told my therapist about my suicidal urges. i don't think you should tell her you're having them. they are programmed to put you in the hospital because if they dont, they could be held liable if something bad happens.

my last psych hold - it sucked being put in the ambulance and stuff, but when iw as in the hospital it wasnt bad. they had good food, the staff was nice, and the patients were really cool and friendly. i liked being there because everyone understood me with no judgment. not saying i want to go back, but im just glad that i wasn't in an area with really whacky people who were screaming all the time."
depression,fczwri9,t3_ejp00t,1578109942.0,I am lucky in that the therapist I currently have completely gets me and I am totally honest with her. Make sure you don't hold anything back. You deserve a better life.

depression,fco60d9,t3_ehzrkw,1577824736.0,"good. social media is just like any other product - they want you to have it so that they can make money. being present, yes, that is key. but you also have to value yourself. easier said than done especially if you have had traumatic past and you feel there is no hope."

depression,fco5fjr,t3_ei6jh8,1577824425.0,lol. i used to think that being around people at a party made me feel better. it doesn't. especially when everyone is so fake. these people and their followers can go live that life if they want.
depression,fcnt9tf,t3_ei30zb,1577817986.0,"I think that if I didn't have depression, I would probably have a lot more responsibility and a lot more attention from people. I would be depended on. Because I'm in my shell and withdrawn from people, no one really cares that I exist. 

Overall, my depression has lasted decades and sometimes I feel like I would rather be me than a normal person, because I'm comfortable with what I know.  Even though I'm depressed, its kind of easy to be depressed because you don't really have to do anything. The mental pain is hard though. 

There was a time when I felt like I was ok (still had underlying issues). I was really in a ""flow"" then. I was getting respect and accolades. That was actually pretty cool because I looked forward to each day."
depression,fcnrv73,t3_ei10pc,1577817243.0,"im so similar to you. i had an advanced degree and didnt starve as a child. i was mentally abused. and i also know that things will only get worse for me as i get older, presumably because im immature and i dont have much talent. some people are able to tackle life because they are strong have have support. i just dont. im not some entrepreneur with a great idea who's going to become a success."

depression,fcksjt2,t3_ehgwoc,1577732262.0,"The hotline is a joke. The government just created the hotline to cover their ass. They don't want suicides as it looks bad on their part.

depression,fcks8wh,t3_ehlgkn,1577732076.0,"This is what is weird for me. I seem to have a good year every three years, and 2017 was my last good year. So by theory, 2020 will be a good year for me right? But I don't really see any hope at this point - my dad wanted to kill himself at the very same age that I am now. And it is not socially acceptable for me to tell anyone I have suicidal thoughts, because it will end up in me going to the hospital. So I do not have anyone to talk to  at this point. it is weird how the universe makes you feel that you have no other option when your brain doesn't work right. 

I mean, I don't seem to have anything to hope for. I don't have any career, any spouse, any money, any friends. Most people in their 30's have all of those things and then they end up building but I can only go backwards it seems.

My advice: find a passion and become the best at it. Later in life, when you want a job, you need to find a talent that you have and get paid well for it. It could be music, it could be anything. Focus now on finding what you're good at and become very dedicated to it. You're already better off than me because you have a good family. You can have a good future if you focus now and learn how to deal with negative thoughts. If you cater to the negative thoughts, and isolate yourself, you are screwed."

I am so sorry this happened to you and I can definitely understand what you're going through. The problem is that a person who has a good life (born to mentally sane parents, had good environment) won't understand anything that you say. They will just say that you're ""blaming"" people.

At this point, even if i do get ""better"", i will have to rebuild again which takes a lot of time and effort. I am like you in that I don't want anything in life. Some people were lucky and got off to a great start, and have a lot to live for. As you get older life gets more complicated. I'm not the kind of person that likes complexity. I went through many years being alone, and depressed."
depression,fdedlow,t3_ekqsl7,1578336710.0,at your age i was extremely lonely. i had no one. i was really weird. working out was the only things that helped me. and music.
depression,fd79ha2,t3_ek7pnd,1578201185.0,"that is awesome. when someone genuinely likes you, that really helps a lot."
depression,fd6d7pt,t3_ek27qj,1578189182.0,"i know about the tired feeling. my life won't get better either. my brain won't allow it to, because it doesn't work properly."
depression,fd6cxcd,t3_ek1svd,1578189058.0,"well you'll feel really lonely if you do all of that. 

but i understand what you mean. you feel like you have no future, yet too afraid to kill yourself. it's a feeling that not many will understand."
depression,fd6clal,t3_ejsoej,1578188911.0,"i know. 

no one can see your pain, which isn't necessarily their fault. but, what bothers me is if someone has cancer, people cant necessarily see that either yet everyone rallies around that person and they don't have to hide it from the world.

lets face it. saying you have severe depression is taboo. people will pity you at best. they won't sympathize especially if they dont have mental illness."
depression,fd6c2o7,t3_ejw74l,1578188686.0,"You seem mature beyond your years. At least you know what adulthood is like. At your age, I will still obsessed with video games and thought it would always be like that. 

There is a small subsection of people who were able to make it in something they are really passionate about (acting, etc). They probably have really nice lifestyles. Other than that the average person is working an average job.   


For me, I actually did enjoy my early 20's. You should look into therapy and try to make a 5 year plan. You are WAY too young to be giving up."
depression,fczz1o5,t3_ejosz9,1578111091.0,"i feel you man. everyone in my dad's family was bad at life too. most people died early. my grandfather died early because he got sick and didnt want to live anymore. when you're not good at life, you probably feel lonely, right?"
depression,fczyuue,t3_ejpc4i,1578110993.0,"yeah, if you're not getting girls now it will probably get harder as you get older unless you realize somethings now. look up red pill, watch pick up artist videos, and read the game. you can change things around. you're just too nice and not assertive enough now and if you're feeling suicidal you will never get a goal. show some dominance, LEAD, be funny, and act like you don't give a shit. if you're falling head over heels for a girl, you're doing it the wrong way. if you want a better future, start lifting heavy and have interests outside of girls."
depression,fczydw2,t3_ejdj5b,1578110758.0,"I am extremely afraid of the pain, not about what happens after I die. I have a low pain threshold.  


Here's the thing - why am I so afraid of the pain, if I know that the pain of living longer will be even worse? I know I'm not really going to get better. I have envisioned scenarios in which I'm successful in going about it, but I can't really get myself to try it. I think I'm really a coward."
depression,fczxqpj,t3_ejockg,1578110431.0,"i was put on a 72 hour hold after my suicide attempt, but never told my therapist about my suicidal urges. i don't think you should tell her you're having them. they are programmed to put you in the hospital because if they dont, they could be held liable if something bad happens.

my last psych hold - it sucked being put in the ambulance and stuff, but when iw as in the hospital it wasnt bad. they had good food, the staff was nice, and the patients were really cool and friendly. i liked being there because everyone understood me with no judgment. not saying i want to go back, but im just glad that i wasn't in an area with really whacky people who were screaming all the time."
depression,fczwri9,t3_ejp00t,1578109942.0,I am lucky in that the therapist I currently have completely gets me and I am totally honest with her. Make sure you don't hold anything back. You deserve a better life.
depression,fcryiyc,t3_eihb2v,1577908398.0,"I was reading the article about that plane crash the other day with the sports reporter. I was like, why couldn't that have been me? She had a great life and wanted to live. Meanwhile, I'm still here, waiting till my last breath."
depression,fco66ud,t3_ei0bz1,1577824833.0,"i don't know if this makes you feel better but those attractive asian girls deal with a lot of drama and b.s. they get involved in things that you definitely dont wanna be a part of. i think a lot of them want out of their cliques because there is so much hate. and everyone is trying to outdo each other. you're isolated, but at the same time, those girls probably don't feel much better than you do esp when their value is derived from their looks."
depression,fco60d9,t3_ehzrkw,1577824736.0,"good. social media is just like any other product - they want you to have it so that they can make money. being present, yes, that is key. but you also have to value yourself. easier said than done especially if you have had traumatic past and you feel there is no hope."
depression,fco5s09,t3_ei6338,1577824616.0,"believe it or not having friends won't make you happy. especially if you feel that you've been a failure. but i know what you mean, you're suffering now and in limbo because you are too scared to go through the process. that's where i am at right now, and believe me, it's not easy. especially when people are actually out there living and you're witnessing it."
depression,fco5ims,t3_ei5th0,1577824474.0,Suggestion #1) Delete your social media accounts
depression,fco5fjr,t3_ei6jh8,1577824425.0,lol. i used to think that being around people at a party made me feel better. it doesn't. especially when everyone is so fake. these people and their followers can go live that life if they want.
depression,fcnt9tf,t3_ei30zb,1577817986.0,"I think that if I didn't have depression, I would probably have a lot more responsibility and a lot more attention from people. I would be depended on. Because I'm in my shell and withdrawn from people, no one really cares that I exist. 

Overall, my depression has lasted decades and sometimes I feel like I would rather be me than a normal person, because I'm comfortable with what I know.  Even though I'm depressed, its kind of easy to be depressed because you don't really have to do anything. The mental pain is hard though. 

There was a time when I felt like I was ok (still had underlying issues). I was really in a ""flow"" then. I was getting respect and accolades. That was actually pretty cool because I looked forward to each day."
depression,fcnrv73,t3_ei10pc,1577817243.0,"im so similar to you. i had an advanced degree and didnt starve as a child. i was mentally abused. and i also know that things will only get worse for me as i get older, presumably because im immature and i dont have much talent. some people are able to tackle life because they are strong have have support. i just dont. im not some entrepreneur with a great idea who's going to become a success."
depression,fcnrlo0,t3_ehve2q,1577817101.0,"damn, i thought about having someone kill me as well. i dont know how to get them to do it though. pay them? they might be worried about the consequences."

depression,fcksjt2,t3_ehgwoc,1577732262.0,"The hotline is a joke. The government just created the hotline to cover their ass. They don't want suicides as it looks bad on their part. Its not like they actually care if the person is suicidal. If you attempt, all kinds of people will try to stop you because they don't want their neighborhood/area associated with a suicide. not because they actually want you to feel better."
depression,fcks8wh,t3_ehlgkn,1577732076.0,"This is what is weird for me. I seem to have a good year every three years, and 2017 was my last good year. So by theory, 2020 will be a good year for me right? But I don't really see any hope at this point - my dad wanted to kill himself at the very same age that I am now. And it is not socially acceptable for me to tell anyone I have suicidal thoughts, because it will end up in me going to the hospital. So I do not have anyone to talk to  at this point. it is weird how the universe makes you feel that you have no other option when your brain doesn't work right. 

I mean, I don't seem to have anything to hope for. I don't have any career, any spouse, any money, any friends. Most people in their 30's have all of those things and then they end up building but I can only go backwards it seems. 

I'm sorry your father is a dick. I know the feeling. When you have a father who is a dick, everything in life is an uphill battle and even if you survive you're just breathing, not really living."
depression,fckrrjy,t3_ehg7l8,1577731781.0,"This decade started well for me, but ended badly. I have a degenerative mental disorder so I feel that as I get older, I'm going more and more off the rails. same thing happened to my grandmother. I wonder how suicidal she was throughout her life.

If you don't have good people around you and a non-defective mind, you are fucked. Period."

depression,fchl299,t3_eh3g9x,1577651475.0,"you're slowly learning that life isn't that easy. the faster you learn that things are only going to get more difficult, the better.

My advice: find a passion and become the best at it. Later in life, when you want a job, you need to find a talent that you have and get paid well for it. It could be music, it could be anything. Focus now on finding what you're good at and become very dedicated to it. You're already better off than me because you have a good family. You can have a good future if you focus now and learn how to deal with negative thoughts. If you cater to the negative thoughts, and isolate yourself, you are screwed."
depression,fchjqpy,t3_eh2784,1577651136.0,"having more money doesn't guarantee you'll feel better. i was making 6 figures at one point, i still felt like a loser as I had no social life and spent my free time talking to people on the internet .

on the other hand, a person making 10 bucks an hour could be quite happy.

life is extremely complex. there is no set cure. you could have a career, a spouse, and a home and still be depressed."
depression,fchhrf7,t3_eh84me,1577650604.0,"You are probably right. There will be a slim fraction of people who might end up successful but this world is becoming complicated and dark. People are really rude to one another and social problems, economic problems, etc will cause major havoc. Mental health is becoming an epidemic. Not much funding for it either. 

Do you get jealous of people who die in car accidents? 

If you are wanting to die, I'm sure there is some power above who knows that you were handed a bad life."
depression,fchgceh,t3_eh9vb9,1577650248.0,"I definitely have not. I have severely depressed family members who aren't good at life, and because of that they are incredibly toxic around me. I've just been breathing, not living. 

I am so sorry this happened to you and I can definitely understand what you're going through. The problem is that a person who has a good life (born to mentally sane parents, had good environment) won't understand anything that you say. They will just say that you're ""blaming"" people. 

I have had some good years but then like you things go south. I'll have some major setback that makes my depression return and then I go back to giving up on everything that I was doing. When I'm in my shell, I completely isolate myself."

depression,fchctap,t3_eh41bc,1577649292.0,"try this. do something really nice for one of them and make it public. i think what you need to have is ulterior motives. you're not doing the nice thing because you're a nice person. you're doing it because you want people to appreciate you more. i hate to break it to you this way, but you might be a boring person. the universe right now is telling you to change something in order to get more love."
depression,fbcfjrs,t1_fb8to6m,1576722717.0,"same here.

for a while, i was ok. but it was my mind tricking me into thinking that i was ok. I have ALWAYS had a mental health condition. It will never go away. 

I'd say the only thing is, that my 14 year old self wouldn't have known how to do it."
