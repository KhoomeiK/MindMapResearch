They’re also fab for after sex if you don’t have time for a full-scale cleanup, particularly if you’re prone to thrush."
veganuk,ffqzjnr,t3_eum5hj,1580147162.0,Gluten free options. They’re sorely missing from fast food places!
veganuk,ffqyd83,t1_ffq9sus,1580146410.0,"I did my first Ocado shop last week and I got two substitutions! Hoping that it was a one off. In their defence, they were very good substitutions, a different brand of balsamic vinegar and the plain creamy Sheese instead of the garlic and herb one."

thesims,ffqpwep,t1_ffo3a2l,1580140880.0,When TS3 came out I absolutely *hated* this EP as it’s such a departure from the series. But now I realise it’s got a particular charm that I quite enjoy.
thesims,ffqk539,t3_eucm8e,1580136798.0,I didn’t know I needed this until now.
Instagramreality,ffq635d,t1_ffq5gpj,1580122497.0,Somebody recommended it to me for slow-healing tattoos so I found some in the bathroom cabinet and the smell was... triggering.

Instagramreality,ffq1jcu,t1_ffpzxhl,1580115289.0,"My mum has some super genes that means she’s never had stretch marks, so when I got them on my thighs at 11 (early growth spurt) she took me to the doctor because she didn’t know what they were. I was so ashamed of them for *years* because I had no idea they were perfectly normal."
unitedkingdom,ffltwzo,t3_eu4ph1,1580044159.0,I use Klarna all the time for clothes purchases. Gives you 30 days to pay and reflects the price change as soon as you send something back. It’s very convenient.

NoStupidQuestions,ffla09l,t1_ffjr0ij,1580036873.0,Oof I get the opposite. Makes me feel way more anxious.
NoStupidQuestions,ffl96g3,t1_ffkqvxh,1580036645.0,"Enquire about toric lenses! They’re ever so slightly weighted so they don’t spin in your eye. I used to wear regular lenses as they didn’t make torics in my prescription, and when I finally got them I could read 4 lines further down on the chart. Truly a game changer."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffhqr8x,t1_ffgv2o5,1579948919.0,I can definitely tell you’ve read a lot of The Daily Mail. This is spot on.
vegan,ffhpm19,t3_etio8t,1579947153.0,"I did keto for about 6 months a couple years back as I have PCOS and ‘they’ claimed it would help. But I felt shitty without vegetables, and then I thought to myself, ‘why am I scared of vegetables? Why am I following a diet that demonises VEGETABLES?’ It’s so fucking dumb."

unitedkingdom,ffc1sjd,t3_espwwa,1579789376.0,"I massively cut down on my meat intake towards the end of last year and have been doing Veganuary since the second (because no one wants to make big lifestyle changes when hungover). 

I’ve genuinely found it really easy, probably helped by the fact that dairy was quite clearly messing my tummy up. 

Once I stopped looking at meals as ‘veggies, a carb, a protein’, it became much easier. I make a lot of stuff in the Instant Pot and add brown rice or pasta along with veggies or salad. And contrary to how I used to feel when I ate beans, it’s settled my IBS right down!"
unitedkingdom,ffc1hyf,t1_ffbqrui,1579789155.0,"This is one of my fave veggie recipes, I like to add beans to it and pressure cook it so it’s done really fast: https://veganheaven.org/recipe/mushroom-bourguignon-super-easy-recipe/"

vegan,ff6oefn,t1_ff5vvq9,1579631506.0,"I too thought they’d been banned a long time ago. I did see one with animals in the 90s, but I think since then the public has viewed them pretty harshly so maybe they just haven’t come over here?"
todayilearned,ff67uf6,t1_ff5tkh5,1579621199.0,"> I always find that some time away from work has me chompin' at the bit to get back. 

Speak for yourself! I took nearly all my holiday in November and December and going back was as awful as I expected."
todayilearned,ff67nnp,t1_ff5gywy,1579621072.0,"That still sounds absurd to me. In England, both my primary and high schools were 9-3.30."
veganuk,ff4ku72,t1_ff4912y,1579566046.0,"I did keto too, for like 6 months. How did you find it? I was always hungry, never experienced that fabled boost in energy, and working out became *really* hard. And I really missed veggies!"
