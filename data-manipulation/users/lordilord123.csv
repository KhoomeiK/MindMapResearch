antifeminists,fe1w4eg,t1_fe1kkql,1578831615.0,"Okay, lets say what you call ""pussypass"" is real, then it probably takes away 5-10% of woman crimes.
But there is no ""pussypass"" for stuff like serious assault or armed robbery.
Men just commit more crimes than woman get over it bro.
The thing is they are still a small part of all men and dont represent the majority of men. 
But what you are doing is denying facts.."
antifeminists,fe1ij6t,t1_fdzxvfc,1578826837.0,"Woman deserve the same pay/hour, in the same work, but if they work less obviously they deserve less, how isnt that common sense.

Men obviously commit more crimes how do you deny it. 
The reason is testosterone, if youre in a bar and somebody gets the fuck beaten out of them it was most likely a man."
antifeminists,fdyy832,t3_en6l4q,1578784734.0,"Tbh it has nothing to do with equality/lack of equality if more men are in prison or homeless. 
They just commit more crimes and are more often self destructive in critical life situations.
Its a fact im sry but i cant agree with the listed points being indicators for sexism towards men.
It only shows that men and woman are different in their being, and in my opinion there is nothing wrong with that. 
Both genders tend to have their strengths and weaknesses."
antifeminists,fdknb5s,t3_elo74g,1578507132.0,"smh you guys really need to stop report these pink pillars..
Obviously these woman are a very, very small minority mostly built out of tremendously low educated woman who probably enjoy low social status aswell have a history of physical & mental abusage throught men which is hard, but they are blinded from their hate..
They are not rational and you shouldnt treat them like they are.. no point in discussing with these people, its as senseless as discussing or shaming radical islamists or rasict cu clux clan.
The biggest problem these woman have is not with men, its with themselves. 
And we, as rational people should care for our wellbeing and dont give this much of our expensive time to these low self worth people who have absolutely nothing we could be interested in."

You just wont find them here because these woman are for equality the same what radical leftists are for the liquidation if racism- they do more harm than good even if their intension might be decent."

And if you probably go on avoiding talk to them they are not going to stop Think it..
Anyway, the moment you talk in a nice day to them its all forgotten but you can not find out of you dont take the step.

When my education program starts, i will see if i Made enough progress to stay at work around people for the whole day. 

If thats not the case,  which i thibk is very likely considering my actual situation i will need to make a decision
- stationary therapy 
- move to another City, see how life goes while working on self improvement & probably stationary therapy if it doesnt work out. 


I need to change a lot of things, very important is like you said grattitude& self love, self worth..
I also recently read a book about how positive thinking can change your life and im trying to reprogram my subconcious mind for my own benefits."
