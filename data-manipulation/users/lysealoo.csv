bipolar,fdibrvr,t1_fdi9a43,1578439373.0,I also have to take it in the morning because I'll be up all night. That is crazy it does that differently to others.

bipolar,fdcnadv,t3_ekkifi,1578279150.0,"I'm behind I guess, what's it mean?"
bipolar,fc97fdq,t1_fc8rbw0,1577548229.0,Yeah I was looking it up but didn't find much about how it feels to experience it. Didn't know if that's what's happening.
bipolar,fc8l122,t1_fc6y05d,1577537120.0,"Is the tachycardia that weird whole body sensation I get that I have to sit down? Like I feel a flood of adrenaline or something and I'm tingly in my chest and it extends to my limbs.  I started feeling those on seroquel, went away on latuda, its back on vraylar. 

So weird feeling. And it happens randomly."
bipolarart,fbyaijp,t3_eex8fj,1577212076.0,I LOVE the way that nose is drawn. It looks so good!
