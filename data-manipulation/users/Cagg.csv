However, he's welcome to change dentists wherever he wants. Dentist should have been smarter about the fee. Which essentially prolly exists to keep people from fucking up his schedule which is fair. 

Itd be like someone buying the wrong part for a massive car restoration project. Going to return it and being charged a restocking fee and then deciding to go elsewhere.  A smart business would recognize the potential and inform then ""usually we'd charge a restock fee but since it's your first time/ you're buying a lot of parts I'm gonna waive it.""

The doc has the policy to protect his time and schedule.  Thats fair, but OP is fair to choose and change docs whenever he chooses. Neither one is as an asshole.

Tailgating and cell phone use while driving are illegal, too. I’m sure if she had a dash cam it would easily prove her guilty since she was on the phone. 

No I'm not ESH, both of them endangered people. My point is though if someone comes screaming up on you flashing their high beams it's probably the case they are in an emergency. Just move over the fact brake checking is being considered as an acceptable option is bonkers. 

>
>What if he couldn’t move over? I’ve been in that situation before, where a speed demon rode my ass for three miles because I couldn’t get past traffic enough to let him by. That’s not the easiest solution, here. 

If you cant move over I say let off the gas and wave them on, when you're slow enough I'm sure theyll pass but the main difference is you arent suddenly and rapidly changing speeds.

>Lastly, what if he didn’t break check her? What if he legitimately had to break? Then what? Just because this one situation was a break check doesn’t mean that people like her exist and kill people on the road every day. And they don’t need someone to break check them; they run through red lights and hit other cars and pedestrians and they kill people too. OP’s interference isn’t necessary for idiotic drivers to do idiotic things. 

Then what? Then hes not the asshole, however, he didn't have to brake he didnt have to slam his brakes and go 65 to 35. Of course people like this exist on the road but it's not your job to police them. See if you can catch a plate and call the police. 

>Don’t be an apologist for her. She gave zero shits about everyone else’s safety, about killing people, so I’m sure a break check is the LEAST of her concerns.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

I never once claimed she was faultless dont put words in my mouth. I'm just pointing out brake checking is extremely reckless and shouldnt be a thing.

We still dont even know WHY she was on the phone, speeding and flashing her lights I'm not convinced it wasnt an emergency. Why wouldnt she have passed on a broken yellow? Who would tell the police the were on their phone? It doesn't make sense tbh.

This is the one factor I thought might be at play. I understand how you could feel this way but you should be more secure in your relationship. if someone wants to cheat they can, at any point. They might have to lower their standards or whatever, but they can. The only thing anchoring them to us is the promise and commitment we made to each other. You should feel confident that your boyfriend is committed to you and won't wander off over some big tits. Hell even if he loves YOUR body that is ephemeral everyone gets old.
