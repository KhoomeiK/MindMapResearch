That just means they pick on someone else weaker right? Not that it's your fault. But it sure isn't a solution. I don't expect children to have the solution, but I am sure there is more to be done by the adults involved."
atheism,ffbpoas,t1_ffbb1ua,1579777479.0,"All of that is fair but only brushes on my question.

It sounds like in your case you believe you were the ""type of student to be bullied"" but you were not. Lucky.

I am just curious if violently standing up for oneself actively stops bullies, or escalates the violence. And I don't know either way. I definitely wouldn't personally use an 11 year old as a test subject to find out."
atheism,ffarfbl,t1_ffad4n7,1579742744.0,It also could have lead to even more extreme physical retaliation. By OP's description she was caught by surprise. She couldn't have avoided it. Are you any sure fighting back is more likely to have stopped it than escalating the problem?
BadMensAnatomy,fes8uvn,t1_feqeipv,1579362645.0,Tits don't cure erectile disfunction. You sure can use ED to try to manipulate someone though.

I just happen to know better than to let people stew in misogyny, sexism and hate isn't some passive thing that *happens* to people when they don't have sex. There is attitude, upbringing, and these echo chambers. And of course personal choice. It's not some disease people catch."
IncelTears,fenitwu,t1_fenggvg,1579285619.0,"I have spent time with objectively attractive people who simply weren't worth exploring a relationship with. Even if attractive is a good piece of one night stands, many people are in it for relationships, short or long term."
IncelTears,fenfkb1,t1_fen5jcm,1579283612.0,"For someone who can write paragraphs to call people names, this simple contradiction seems like one you can't overcome. 

Either all people who don't have sex (but not by choice) are incels, or there are other things wrong with incels. Logic finds it likely to be the latter."
IncelTears,fenezhq,t1_femuldo,1579283257.0,"Women chose men for varied reasons. Because women are individuals. Some are into looks, some money, some resources. Most just want a connection with someone."
IncelTears,fenec7r,t1_fen839b,1579282865.0,The group seems to really enjoy bringing themselves down it's the smallest piece of self deprecation honestly.
dndmemes,fen42dv,t1_fen3dkr,1579276511.0,"Saying cr fans literally means all of them. That's how language works. If I said ""pens use ink"" and ""all pens use ink"" they mean the same thing.

You could just accept that you being imprecise changed the meaning of your statement."
dndmemes,fen15jy,t1_femwi8h,1579274649.0,I think the difference between some and all is not semantic and it is really divisive of a community to suggest entire subgroups are involved in some bad practice.

Like we could say ""why celebrate [insert holiday], we needed a habitable earth first?"" But I think that is arguing semantics and misses the point."
wholesomememes,fd3sia8,t1_fd3ox17,1578161313.0,"So I think you missed the point. Why do you feel you need proof of a woman doing something you would instantly accept a man doing? It's no one's job to prove that women are equal in potential, because they just are.

wholesomememes,fd3n9ek,t1_fd3m8ok,1578159920.0,"Your edit tried to make it wholesome but you would never ask for ""give me one provable example of a man as a mechanic."" And you really need to check that sexism- women can do some boss shit, just like anyone else homie."

I moved 2 streets and went from super fast fiber with at&t to only having the slowest 2 tiers available at comcast."
news,fc6q4ii,t1_fc6p416,1577486652.0,"90% of the time, I have to encounter smoke at the entrance to a public building, as I said. An example, because you missed it the first time. Even following laws about distance from the entrance (most businesses maybe some states have these) I have had to walk through a dozen people who made a near impenetrable wall of smoke. That isn't an isolated occurence. Easily hundreds at this point in my life. At university it was 4 classes per day so doing this 20 times a week. Now mind you some campuses are smoke free now but not all.

What is my endgame? Pretty clear. I have the right to never have to endure that. It causes me physical harm. I don't care where or when they do it, as long as it doesn't interfere with my life.

My right to not have others harm me DOES supercede someone's right to enjoy a cigarette."

Many of the positions that are only 12-15 per hour (its 10 min wage here) require years of experience or degrees despite being entry level. 

If fast food and retail is hiring 100 people at minimum wage and an up and coming business is hiring 5 people at competitive wages, young adults are going to end up in minimum wage, regardless of professionalism and work ethic."
