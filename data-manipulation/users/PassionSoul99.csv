depression,fgjwxop,t1_fgjwr05,1580852994.0,Yay aha. I have mood swings too but depression is my baseline mood recently and it peaks and lowers from that baseline.
depression,fgjwdcy,t1_fgjw2gg,1580852677.0,"Yeah if you feel that way it would be a concern since you can get worse for a bit when you first start until they're in your system. 

They helped me cope a bit though from 2017-2018. Was on prozac/fluoxetine"
depression,fgjvuk4,t1_fgjvp32,1580852387.0,I have therapy on thursday though so hopefully i can get on anti depressants again. Havent been on them for a year now but I desperately need them again.
depression,fgjvfkv,t1_fgjvdjs,1580852159.0,it's painful

trees,fgj4y73,t1_fgiuy71,1580837064.0,"Cool man he'll be fine just sometimes the hyperactivity gets out of control for me sometimes, it depends on my mood as well though but its only on sativas."

Coffee,fgijopu,t1_fgi4mih,1580823629.0,No problem hope it works out for you.
Coffee,fghxq0v,t1_fghts2c,1580797206.0,Yeah I’m gonna get a temperate kettle one of these days aha. For now I boil the kettle and wait did it to stop bubbling the pour.
Coffee,fggri5h,t1_fggr919,1580767945.0,I have yet to try the inverted method but regular method is handy due to the drainage allowing me to add a little more so my cup is filled. The only argument for inverted I know about is it allows longer steep times. I watched a video of a barista brewing inverted and regular side by side and she tasted them and said they were identical so I’m not really sold on inverted tbh.
Coffee,fggr4fa,t1_fggpywn,1580767704.0,Yeah it would be awesome if an Aeropress could brew 500ml at once cos my favourite cup is 500ml and I haven’t used it since I got my Aeropress.
Coffee,fggr0rm,t1_fggqszc,1580767642.0,"If you mean do I dilute similar to an Americano? Nope. When I initially pour the 250g of water in to the top it drains a little and I add a little more back to the top, let it steep, and plunge. Doing this fills my 350ml cup perfectly."
Coffee,fggphfm,t1_fggpcu8,1580766716.0,"Cool I’ll give it a shot sometime. 
I’m pretty sure I read 18 grams is ideal for Aeropress though and it’s working for me. Doesn’t taste weak at all to me."
Coffee,fggpbyf,t1_fggf8hy,1580766627.0,"Yeah I love how the puck just pops out, french press was a nightmare to clean and sometimes I couldn’t be bothered and forget and would have to resort to instant (yuck) in the morning or until I cleaned it."
Coffee,fggp7d4,t1_fgggj74,1580766552.0,"I use regular method and fill it above number 4, let it drain into cup slightly, then fill back to the 4 and brew for 1:30 minutes. 
I use a 350 ml cup."
Coffee,fggp0qh,t1_fggm2jf,1580766442.0,I can’t even imagine how that wouldn’t be bitter.
Coffee,fggow66,t1_fggosrs,1580766367.0,Yeah same. This morning I tried extra fine and it came out bitter so I’m going back to medium fine.
Coffee,fggothg,t1_fggojz3,1580766321.0,Define unorthodox amount of coffee? I don’t really like using TOO much because I like my bag to last me to get the best bang for my buck. The VERY most id use for a single cup when using french press was 30 grams. Aeropress is amazing with 18 grams for 250ml
Coffee,fggd6eh,t1_fggbgm9,1580759383.0,Yeah it’s a shame more people don’t know about it
Coffee,fgg7fts,t3_eyaziq,1580755876.0,"If your uk based I get my coffee from RAVE, they roast and ship it the same day and it tastes great. Think I’m gonna try HasBean on my next order though."

Coffee,ffzvhzz,t1_ffzuz2q,1580393982.0,Thanks.
Coffee,ffzvha8,t1_ffzusg3,1580393967.0,Usually 30 grams for 500ml personally.  I'll try that though thanks.
Coffee,ffzu4wv,t1_ffztyk7,1580392940.0,"Cool, thanks for the info. Guess I'm just gonna have to use a smaller cup then. Unless I fill the rest of the way up with hot water like a lot of cafe's do with espresso."

LSD,ffbh3on,t3_espu28,1579765014.0,They’ve made me not identify with the political system more than I previously was if anything.
depression,febagw5,t1_feaklct,1578956912.0,"Thanks man, we have been trying that with meals and other outings and it’s better than sitting in all the time."

tea,fdgbivn,t3_el42oc,1578388657.0,Mei Leaf mostly but I don’t drink the expensive stuff everyday. My everyday tea is clipper organic green tea.
