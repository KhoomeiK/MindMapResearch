bulletjournal,fdi2w66,t3_elaond,1578434760.0,I wish I had your sex drive. I just had a baby 6 months ago and in the past year we have maybe had sex 7 times.
bulletjournal,fdeojav,t3_ekzywy,1578343348.0,Anyone else a Sunday starter or is it just me?
bulletjournal,fd5vzcr,t1_fd5vu7w,1578182188.0,I have not! Thank you!
keto,fcjc7yu,t3_ehfe2p,1577682758.0,I always need a buddy. It’s so hard to keep at it when your friends and families stuff their face with whatever they want. But I’ve convinced my mother to start with me New Years.
stopsmoking,famkgzv,t1_famget7,1576206036.0,All of this started out as a joke. I don’t need help. Chill out. It’s not that serious. Like you said if he wants to quit then he will. And I will support him. But he doesn’t need to “man up”
