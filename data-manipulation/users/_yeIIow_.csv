dogs,fffphwc,t1_fffonua,1579888979.0,"hmmm i see yr point.... i think it’s the duty of the owners to reward appropriate play, self regulation, check ins, and recall during play, to redirect occasionally especially if it’s too rough or give enforced breaks.... but ultimately other dogs aren’t humans, they have their own communication and it includes light snapping, growling, even pinning and mouthing, mother dogs do it too, they’re using the tools they have to enact boundaries, they don’t have the tools to run and get a different toy and redirect puppy behavior or the cognitive skills to reward wen puppy is appropriate, that’s just not the association the puppy or other dogs have to each other... 

i don’t think personally that positive only training doesn’t involve discomfort occasionally in general, but i know what u mean, even if it’s safe and ultimately okay, letting other dogs give corrections technically seems like a sort of punishment/negative shaping technique"
