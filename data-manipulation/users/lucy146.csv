pregnant,ffazris,t3_esjdwf,1579748278.0,"Thisss! I’m 29 weeks today and I feel every bit of it.. Naturally I stay at around 100/110lbs, but being 131 is throwing me off. I live in leggings and sweats and big tshirts and hoodies, and I have like no desire to have sex because I hate the way my belly looks.. and honestly it’s not even bad, I have really good skin and carry my weight fairly well and my fiancé loves it (he wants me to keep the weight lol) but my bellybutton is really dark and sticks out like a literal button and I’m just super self conscious about the way I look.."
AskAnAmerican,ffayawh,t3_esebsj,1579747304.0,"My grandad is a rural carrier and typically gets small gifts around Christmas, sometimes he’ll also bring home children’s books that people don’t want for any grandchildren /great grandchildren."
AskReddit,fezkaoo,t3_equok1,1579458244.0,"My dad would keep containers full of water in the basement. He wouldn’t buy bottled water, he would just use empty soda bottles or milk jugs and fill them with tap water “just in case”"

Hair,fecixgy,t1_fecf2a3,1578975031.0,Maybe a little bit of mousse just to clean it up a little? Help train it also
dogs,fdln5jk,t1_fdlhomt,1578527810.0,"That’s my issue, she DOES go out every night before bed, but always wakes me up sometime throughout the night wanting to go back outside.."
dogs,fdkp5mn,t1_fdkp0vy,1578508242.0,She most definitely does. My door frame and blinds can tell you all about it!
dogs,fdkouik,t1_fdkobdb,1578508057.0,"She cannot handle being in a room alone much less in a crate. And I honestly do not have the energy at the moment to try to even begin crate training her. She cannot stand if one member of the family is outside without her (if SO, myself, or my dog, go outside she’s pacing from the door to the window whining until they come back.)"
dogs,fdkogea,t1_fdkno9x,1578507821.0,Well her ‘mess’ is literally just her shitting everywhere or chewing on the kids toys that are left out (but that’s expected from a dog her age) usually I bring her into my bedroom so she doesn’t go in the house or chew anything and she’s fine. She just wakes me up constantly. I’ve tried ignoring her but she just gets louder and is much more persistent than I am..
dogs,fdko2ux,t1_fdkncki,1578507595.0,My only issue with letting her out more during the day is that she will stay gone ALL day with the neighbor dogs. And I can’t walk her 3-4+ times everyday with two toddlers and it being so cold.. I let her out early in the morning (before the neighbor lets their dogs out) and then again usually early afternoon and call her back in after about 20-30 minutes (rural area allows for dogs to run lose as long as they’re not causing and problems)
dogs,fdknibq,t1_fdkn4eq,1578507250.0,"She freaks out in the crate and has some extreme separation anxiety.. the one time we did put her in a crate she ended up flipping it and breaking it.

I’ve tried getting ready and then letting her out but she still insists on going out again a few hours later. And If I let her out and go back to bed she’s at the door barking sometimes 10 minutes later or a few hours later.."
AskReddit,fdkkjc6,t3_elssvy,1578505510.0,That when I was an adult I would just know my multiplication and division. (Age =knowledge?) I HATED multiplication in school and still can’t multiply off the top of my head.

dogs,fcltb3m,t3_eho07v,1577755951.0,"My dog helped me a great deal, but the key would be to find the right dog. When I got my girl I was searching shelters for a dog and happened to come across her, she was older than all the other dogs I had seen from 3 separate shelters and we clicked with just eye contact. She’s been by my side since that day. Still a stray at heart but she always comes home and is very stable minded. It just depends entirely on the dog."
relationships,f8thv6o,t1_f8thebe,1574803716.0,"I’ve been working on my jealousy for a long time now and I’m trying to find a happy medium, we’ve also gone a few rounds about him being hypocritical but I tend to shut down during arguments and just drop the subject."
