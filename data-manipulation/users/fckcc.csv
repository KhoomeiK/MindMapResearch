KimetsuNoYaiba,fejmz0j,t3_epfi6g,1579180317.0,"Y'all are so weird. I don't mean to be a buzzkill, but are there no other *legal* characters you can sexualize instead of a 14 year old? Yes, she can age up/down but she's still 14 regardless. Keep it in your pants even if they are just animations."

depression,fcxrsoa,t3_ejeyfi,1578069581.0,"I can relate because my ex who just recently broke up with me was truly the only person I could be completely honest with or cry to. I'm still devastated and miserable. No matter how hard I try to distract myself, I just feel as though lonliness is always looming over my head. I never know what to say, but I hope everything works out for you."
confession,fctcmy3,t1_fct05s0,1577939086.0,Why would I do that? (Sorry idk if this is a joke or not)
confession,fctcllu,t1_fct9t66,1577939055.0,"I never asked to be friends with her after the fact though, I just tried to be friendly with her and she tried to sabotage my other friendships years later and I don't know why."

depression,fcp4dhd,t3_eibb6g,1577850094.0,I feel you. Honestly the seemingly silliest things get me down sometimes. You're not a creep and it's normal to feel this way after being treated so rudely! Keep your chin up :) have a good new year!

orangeisthenewblack,fc9iyjh,t3_egpw8y,1577553349.0,"Yeah, Kukudio was really scary to me. She was delusional but at the same time... wasn't? She also didn't have good conflict resolution skills, but overall kept under the radar in the prison. I really wish we found out what she was in for. She said she never hurt anyone but her definition of such may be very skewed in her delusions. 
Even Suzanne, who obviously has her own struggles, was more than aware that they wouldn't be able to live in the woods forever and such..."
conspiracy,fc6wytr,t3_egdy3q,1577491640.0,"Y'all are really immature. Instead just of focusing on what actually occured like you should, y'all attack their identity as well. There's nothing wrong with being confused or making mistakes, but calling them a ""he/she"" among other things isn't how you properly and maturely discuss this topic. Grow up, regardless of how you feel towards their identification."
