This makes no sense to me. Based on your living situation. Any guest coming to town would stay in a hotel. Why would you stay in a hotel!! That just boggles the mind.

It usually is a given that out of town guest stay in a hotel if they home is not equipped to accommodate them"

I live in the Washington DC area and do not ride much anymore. There is just to much traffic at all times of the day. It gets to a point that you think WHEN am I going to get into an accident verses IF. Sooner or later it more then likely is going to happen.

It does suck that you had to travel while sick but what were you supposed to do? As for him he said what he had to say. But for them to keep going on and on about it is a AH move. I would have set his ass straight as well.

For me I do not get attention like that so I thought they were crazy to blow them off. But I realized that they get attention ALL the time so they can be picky as hell who they give there attention to.

EscapefromTarkov,feceqtc,t3_eod9tr,1578972168.0,For me I think I will wait till full release. IMO the upgrade is mainly for the larger stash and secure container. If you can justify spending the money on those 2 things then go for it.
AmItheAsshole,fecc24e,t1_fea93z6,1578970466.0,Now that I think about it. Why didnt OP ask her what it was and just go get it. It was probably something that was inexpensive or obviously not roomies stuff. For me the text would have been good enough especially if they are dated the same damn day. A step further would be if there were older text along with pics at least.

I get it you need to be cautious. But the dated text messages should have been enough dude.   


I was going to vote AH but I feel you were to cautious. What was the point of asking for more proof and being presented with viable proof (text message) and still not letting her in.

AS a business owner she screwed you over. You lost a days pay because of her. The 100 is not even going to cover it.   


She basically either read your terms and did not care or did not read them. I suspect she read them and figured you would just do it.
