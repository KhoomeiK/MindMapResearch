worldbuilding,ffcotmk,t3_eswrhp,1579804028.0,"The book American Gods (less so the show, no hate, just less so) has some similar themes.  One of the characters is Wisakedjak, or Whisky Jack - which is actually Iktomi a Lakota spider-god and trickster.

I always thought a fun corruption of that theme would be having Wisakedjak instead be a literal embodiment of Jack Daniels, as if people had worshiped (and lets be honest, they do) the drink so heavily it has been made manifest.

Along those lines Paul Bunyon & John the Conqueror would be fun characters."

GiftofGames,ff7fpvc,t1_ff7dj8a,1579648497.0,"I don't really feel like I owe you an explanation on my financial situation.  I use games to relax as a form of self-care and I can't afford to buy the thing I'm into currently.  I am a student currently, I don't work, my financial aid isn't for games.

I have a lot of games, many of which are bundles from over the years, I have some expensive titles too because people get and lose money over the years, some of my games I haven't played because I never had interest in playing them.  My account is over 9 years old, no shit my profile lvl is 45.

I am active in this community somewhat, I have gifted double what I've received, I've gone out of my way to fulfill a request in the middle of a giveaway I was running just to make someones day.  Who are you?

Fuck me for asking right?"

I completely understand, and made reference to, those organs are still part of your body.  There are a few parts of your body you don't use, but you feel them or what they're attached to."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fegsp7q,t1_fegbyso,1579101644.0,"I don't want to belittle your point - gunshots are devastating and you're right that anywhere a bullet enters your body is going to be harmful.

There are parts of your body you don't use though - [vestigial organs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_vestigiality) are a thing.  

But again, can't get to one of those with a bullet without causing all kinds of horrible damage, just the way you worded it gave me pause."
worldbuilding,feelv6j,t3_eorcks,1579036387.0,"I'm not sure if it has a sub-genre name but Revolution & Enter the Badlands (tv shows) were the first things that popped into my head. 

There is a book series [The Emberverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emberverse_series) that fits the bill, I've only heard about it (I live in the area it's set and used to LARP)."
worldbuilding,feekfug,t3_eoqtgg,1579035553.0,"There's a lot of different ways you can take this.  I know you don't want to make a God of XYZ but thats the common way - something like portfolios from D&D where you pick a couple of things your deity is either in charge of or considers it part of their purview and give it a name.  

The things could be important aspects of mudane peoples lives; like mining, fishing, herding animals; they could be cosmic constants like night, day, the sun, harvest season; they could be specific to your game/world like the a specific region, or from a specific event like a battle.  I think the idea of giving the deity a lot of things rather than just one big thing gives them a little more uniqueness.

So with steampunk you could have your god of steam, but give it flavor from other things in the world - I could see some fun history where an air god and an earth god that were friends, the earth god died so the air god took over it's portfolios - use that as the myth for why you have floating islands.  From there I would just keep rifting on myths that fit in your world - add gods and heroes as needed.  Why did the earth god die?  The cave-world god wanted to expand his territory.  Why are the island flying?  To get away from the cave-world.  These are examples of how to go not necessarily what you should use.

With those myths, every time you add a hero or something, you're adding a bunch of artifacts (the heroes gear or story elements) that become very thematically organic.

Hope this helps."
