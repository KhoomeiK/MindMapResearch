Austin,fe5aquc,t1_fe51bzn,1578867123.0,"Nope.  

I used to work in the industry. Here's what happened in my center, and what was *common* in others. This was a few years ago and not in this city, so I'm not speaking as an authority on Austin.  

So there's a few ways to get people to recycle. The easiest way, is the way Austin does it. Drop all your shit in a can that's recyclable, we'll recycle it. Great in theory, pain in the dick in practice. At my center, people brought their recycling and self sorted. We accepted:  

* Tin Cans  
*  Aluminum cans
* #1 plastics
* #2 plastics 
* paper
* cardboard 
* glass  

And then a few other more rare things. The problem with the above is #1, self serve. You have to bring the shit down. #2, not accepting everything raises the amount of effort, so some people don't care enough.  

So instead, you just accept everything and then sort it from there. And you're going to get a ton of useless shit you don't want or can't be recycled, and you throw it the fuck away. Because shit like #7 plastic or glass is at the end of it's lifecycle, it takes more money and energy to recycle (ish) than it  does to just create new. So there's no market for it and you have to get rid of it somehow.  

But the things from my list above? That's the stuff you really want, and turns out, comprises the bulk of what's recycled anyway."

todayilearned,fe07vcy,t1_fdzs5mc,1578805415.0,">then are SOL for the summer where they get some other job  

That entirely depends on the state and district of the teacher. Here, it's common for teachers to get a 12 month salary, and they choose 
to work over the summer because hey money. Yes, for some it's summer school, but there's always work to be done to make more money."
