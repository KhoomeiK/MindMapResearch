MMORPG,ff9si56,t3_esasvf,1579720271.0,Yeah not an MMO it's kinda like kenshi if you ever saw or played that but anyway the devs said that they are working on the English localization as their number 1 priority right now since it did so good on steam in china but right now there is no exact date as far as I know plus translating chinese to english is tough especially if your trying to be accurate.
MMORPG,ff9s4sm,t3_escckz,1579720006.0,That's what they want us to believe so we pre-order.

gamingsuggestions,feknkn6,t1_fekkjdh,1579203771.0,"I second space station 13. It's a really nice game with servers for hardcore role-playing or just lighter stuff and there are a lot of roles you can play like lawyer, detective, chaplain, biologist, doctor, janitor, botanist, cook, bartender and more."
gamingsuggestions,fej59h9,t3_epduyw,1579157432.0,"Rend is one though it has quite a lot of bad reviews on steam on account of the fact that the devolopers kinda dropped it but in terms of co-op survival with friends I'd say it's pretty damn nice since you just join a server and play together. You can hunt, cook, mine, forge, tame and a lot more stuff. 

Unfortunately or fortunately servers are up for the game but not a lot of people are playing so there is usually only about 1-3 people online at the same time on any given server so you'd have the place more or less all to yourselves."

RagnarokMEternalLove,fe6g7j7,t3_envi0p,1578889938.0,I'm waiting for a new game or server after I wasted all my zeny on refining.
NoMansSkyTheGame,fe3kxhv,t1_fe3kedu,1578850239.0,True. Ships would be kind of less unique and rare then if all you need to do is customize it.
NoMansSkyTheGame,fe3kc6i,t3_enowd1,1578850076.0,Should have someone stand right there while you start up the ship to see if they die from the heat or if nothing happens.
NoMansSkyTheGame,fdzw00n,t3_enhlub,1578797126.0,Possibly NSFW?

destiny2,fdwcji6,t3_emzwn7,1578757334.0,Thanks for the comments and tips guys I got this in the Nightfall: The Ordeal Vanguard. I've really only been playing on and off for a while so I didn't even know of Xur until now.
pics,fdscd1w,t3_emp2z2,1578699377.0,I get mixed feelings when I look at this.
depression,fdsc1jn,t3_emqxrt,1578699158.0,I don't really know. To be honest if I was given proof that heaven or hell were real places or that we do go somewhere when we die then I wouldn't really care and I'd have probably killed myself years ago.
lonely,fdow9m0,t3_emd4vo,1578614316.0,I do it way too often despite the fact that I really don't have any friends or at least no one that would message me first.
depression,fdm407h,t3_em1i69,1578539261.0,Yeah I got zero motivation for anything. Hoping to work on improving this year though hopefully.
lonely,fdlbr83,t3_elvmuq,1578520640.0,I feel like I wrote this post...
gamingsuggestions,fdlam0w,t3_eliifi,1578519961.0,"Since you like Roguelikes and Action maybe you could try Let It Die. It's pretty fun imo and depending on how much you like Roguelikes it could give you endless hours of fun.
 https://store.steampowered.com/app/794600/LET_IT_DIE/

You could also try Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup though it's 2D and not on steam."
gamingsuggestions,fdl9yc5,t1_fdinxaq,1578519575.0,When it comes to Monster Hunter World it might seem repetitive when you watch gameplay videos but when you play it yourself you definitely won't think that. It mag seem like you just do the same stuff everytime but each hunt is never really the same since the monsters can really go to any part of the map they want or chase you down and the fact that they can fight each other keeps everything fresh so even if you fight the same monster 10 times in a row it won't really feel like your doing the same thing plus each weapon plays completely different too.
gamingsuggestions,fdl8pbe,t3_elilb6,1578518945.0,"Toram online( anime style MMORPG with a classless system so you can choose which skills you want to make your ideal character , a good story and decent graphics)

 Alchemia Story ( anime styled turn based MMO rpg with very great character customization and graphics for mobile as well as a decent story with likeable characters)

 Villagers and Heroes ( cross platform MMORPG that has things like life skills such as fishing, farming and carpentry but is kind of dated graphics wise)

The world of Magic (cute 2d MMORPG)

Graal ( 2d social MMORPG for for people of all ages really)

Wooz World ( 2d social MMO mainly focused on making friends, chatting, getting more clothes, furnitures and accessories for you character)

old school RuneScape..

Call of Duty Mobile"

gamingsuggestions,fdl62pr,t1_fdk57ec,1578517667.0,"I second all of these especially Bioshock, Risk of Rain 2, Alan Wake and Let It Die!"
gamingsuggestions,fdl4ncu,t1_fdk0crp,1578516976.0,"Maybe you could try something like the bow, bow gun, sword and shield, insect glaive or dual blades? Might do a bit less damage with some of them but they are a bit less heavy compared to other weapons and a little more fast paced in some cases."
gamingsuggestions,fdl42c9,t3_elmwzk,1578516693.0,"If you loved Ragnarok then you could play Ragnarok M Eternal Love it's on mobile but they also have it on PC as well and the graphics are great. they added auto farming too to lessen the grind also they added a way for people to lvl up a bit faster without spending a lot of time but don't get put off by the auto it's not the kind that doesn't do what you want you can set up what skills you want your character to use while autoing and when it comes to mvp hunting, pvp or gvg most people play manually or they will be destroyed.

It gets a lot of events and it's also very active with some seriously competitive guilds and casual ones too."
gamingsuggestions,fdl30ew,t3_elod2b,1578516188.0," I recommend No Man's Sky it's great game and at the beginning you are on an unknown planet you have to survive on while looking for resources to fix your space ship while cataloguing plants and possibly dangerous animals as well as keeping yourself alive by making sure your protected against the harsh environments that might be present on a planet such as snow storms, extreme heat and acid rain.

Once your done with that one planet there are possibly billions more out there for you to explore with new plants and animals (animals vary a lot so you could see a dinosaur, a giant crab, some tentacle monsters, wolves, wolves with six eyes, deep sea cows, flying jelly fish and all kinds of crazy different animals that may be unique and never before seen by anyone except you) you can harvest resources from, fend off and ride not to mention the fact that you can build bases with all sorts of cool stuff. 

You can also play online with more than a dozen people if I'm not mistaken. 

There are also alien space stations you can go to to talk with aliens and possibly learn some of their language or maybe just buy a new ship or upgrade the one you already have."
gamingsuggestions,fdl07u6,t3_elqp3s,1578514740.0,"There is Black Squad imo it is pretty fun and it's basically a bit like CoD and cs go and for me it's a lot more fun. I mainly just play the events which is usually a 10 vs 10 match and it's gets pretty intense and tactical.


I tried Ironsight but I felt it really wasn't as good and was somewhat off."
gamingsuggestions,fdkzf4c,t1_fdi8rps,1578514313.0,Yes Borderlands 2 for the win and maybe Warframe as well since at the beginning the missions are slow enough to get used to the keyboard and mouse somewhat then  it gets progressively more fast paced on some missions.
MMORPG,fdkxvub,t1_fdilorw,1578513413.0,New players will catch up but they obviously have to put in the time to grind skills which will take a large amount of time if you are competitive. If you play like 1-2 hours a day you won't be catching up anytime soon but you won't really be left out of anything.
MMORPG,fdkww4p,t3_elr5v3,1578512831.0,"It was a mobile MMO called Iruna Online that got me into MMOs. It was about maybe 6 years ago that I started playing it and I didn't really understand what to do but I soon found a guild filled with people that would help me with quests and show me the ropes so before I knew it years went by and those people in the guild I joined became long lasting friends. I don't really play that game anymore since most anyone I knew on it aren't playing anymore but I can say that it was the most memorable MMO I've ever played and the best one to me.

I've played all the main MMOs and a lot of the older and lesser known ones but none have given me the same joyful and fun feeling I got while playing Iruna back in the day."
depression,fdksdza,t3_elqwy9,1578510166.0,Mainly because I'm really lonely and I'm not good at making or keeping friends.
socialanxiety,fdks6c6,t3_elp28w,1578510040.0,Really too relatable. Heck sometimes I might not come out of the bathroom stall at work for a long time until I'm sure I'm not gonna see anyone.

MMORPG,fctjjxr,t3_eispi9,1577945513.0,"Despite no MMOs right now being like those shows I'd say since your new to MMOs even though theme park MMOs 
don't sound that great on paper for first timers I think they would be pretty enjoyable especially if you try something that you don't need to play every single day even when you don't want to."
MMORPG,fctiz8l,t3_eijsyz,1577944914.0,I expected as much.
amipretty,fcthpto,t3_eiqpaf,1577943658.0,Looking really good if I lived anywhere near you I would defo date you. Just try to find some good guy like that other person said.
