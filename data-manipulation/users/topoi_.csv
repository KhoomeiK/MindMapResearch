GetMotivated,ff3oufj,t1_ff3n50o,1579545662.0,I suppose it makes sense in the context of the show then. As a stand-alone quote though I dont think it works. Thanks for the explanation !
GetMotivated,ff3kq63,t1_ff38u9k,1579543118.0,"That’s dumb af. Make someone in your family’s day better. Our lives ain’t all about money. And some days you can’t be a better person. People have emotions that make them feel like shit, that’s a normality. If you constantly compare yourself to yesterday you’ll only end up feeling worse when you can’t accomplish something"

osugame,fckqpwp,t1_fckip6w,1577731136.0,a bit easier is kinda an understatement. These high bpm aim heavy maps aren’t easy but the same amount of bounty for touchscreen vs tablet/mouse is kinda unfair. respect it a lot and glad to see scores on these maps but a ton of players have grinded for these scores... they’re just that much harder without touch screen
