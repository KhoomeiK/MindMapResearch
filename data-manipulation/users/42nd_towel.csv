politics,fgijvo1,t1_fgifyp4,1580823785.0,"I volunteer with my local party in a different state, and I can confirm our state party is just as incompetent. I think it’s due to high turnover rate of paid staff. Others are just volunteers. But yeah, there are ways to make the technology work better, like just use a bunch of google sheets, or upload photos to a shared google drive and have a small handful of people updating the sheet and flagging / moving the photos that are done."

teslainvestorsclub,fgfgt1t,t3_ey5a8c,1580738319.0,It’s not wise to put 100% of your money in any one stock. A general rule of thumb is not to put more than 5% of your money in one thing.

teslamotors,fg7yedk,t3_ex61d9,1580604669.0,"I think Elon has talked about this features strategy and prioritizing resources. Basically the end goal is full automation with no human input. As such, that explains why Teslas don’t have and won’t have features like blind spot lights in the mirrors, heated steering wheels, HUDs, etc. any part that will be made obsolete and is going away, why spend time and effort making it more complex now. It won’t be needed soon. Or that’s the idea anyway, and why we don’t have these features."
teslamotors,fg7m2iv,t1_fg7jris,1580595816.0,"yep this is how I understand it too. Also eliminating ""hard coding"" of behaviors like ""if this, then do that."" With a perfect and complete neural net, it should be able to just sample all the cameras and sensors, and know ""output this accelerator value, turn wheel this many degrees"" just like a human would, except our output is ""press your foot"" and ""grab the wheel and turn."" Just bypass the human and put the brain in the machine."

teslamotors,fg7dkc2,t1_fg7d55w,1580589918.0,"Ohh I want a pothole detector too. But where I live, my car would just refuse to drive anywhere if it didn’t want to hit potholes. Wouldn’t leave the driveway. “I’m sorry Dave, I can’t do that.”"
teslamotors,fg7brjv,t1_fg7b67r,1580588702.0,"I’m by no means an expert, but I also seem to recall them saying they’re not just using neural nets for image recognition, but also for behavioral things. And they’ll keep getting better as they add more types. One type they demoed and already shipped was the lane cut in detection. Instead of hard coding “if car blinker on” or “if car crosses lane, then it’s cutting in” they give it examples of true cases, rewind the video, then train what it looks like leading up to it. I’m sure there will be more in the future, like not just “this is a person and moving this direction” but “this person is trying to cross the street” or “this construction worker is waving me to proceed.”"
teslamotors,fg7aymw,t1_fg79gkk,1580588144.0,"Yeah Elon talked a bit about it in the Podcast. The way I understood it, each camera is independently looking at each image separately to identify objects. And they have neural nets that look at one single image and recognize things. The new versions of the neural nets will look at all 8 cameras and the output is a 3D map with distances and everything, almost like they have lidar, but all just using cameras. And a next step also is to not just look at one frame, but neural nets will look at a sequence of frames to perceive motion in 3D."

aww,ffxyb78,t1_ffxd41k,1580334814.0,I heard it actually helps them to practice with dogs because they can feel anxious reading around other people or adults if they make mistakes or go slow or whatever. Practicing with a dog is more relaxing and a judgement free zone. He’s just a good listener.

personalfinance,ffwmxwc,t3_evfz0d,1580305883.0,"I’ll have to double check mine, it’s the first year I’ve done it, but I think mine is different. I don’t get a “discount” on the purchase. I pay full price at the time I buy it. Then a year later if I still have it, they just deposit 20% of what I paid right into my payroll with taxes and stuff taken out. So if I understand correctly, I don’t have to do this trick? Because the “discount” actually just came as extra pay and was taxed then, and the stock itself was paid for full price and sold for whatever it was a year later."
apple,ffv29p8,t1_ffv1acb,1580254020.0,"Yep, it appears to be an iCloud issue, possibly related to family sharing? I have signed out, wiped all devices, and even tried setting up as new without using a backup. One weird thing I found was even though the phone was removed from my devices list under iCloud settings, it actually was listed in some hidden menu under iTunes authorized devices on my Mac, so I removed it there too. The only reason I say it might have something to do with family sharing is because I set up a bogus account a couple years back to try as a workaround for a different issue (wanted to completely reset Music recommendations but keep past purchases). Anyway, that whole thing was a bad idea since there was no real child involved, but I had issues removing / deleting the fake account because of the “age” of the child. Anyway, I finally got Support to disable my family sharing and unlink my main account from that “family,” but I have a suspicion that I accidentally have my “child” linked to that phone, and something on their back end makes it still show up (even though my family sharing mess was turned off)."

However, I do have the time available, and it’s never taken more than a few minutes for me, and my state does have absentee mail-in ballots available if needed, but still I prefer the feeling of in person. Hard to describe."
todayilearned,ffmuvy4,t1_ffmc6v2,1580059213.0,"My office just moved to the ABW (activity based workstations!), work wherever! First come first serve! Problem is we're hiring like crazy, and we're getting to the point where we have more people than desks. (And the new parking garage they built is over capacity now too). The idea of ABW being, some people are in meetings or other areas, so you don't need a desk for everyone. We have little lockers, backpacks and laptops, take your stuff when you get up. But in practice, you often times can't find an open desk when you need one. Also we're not allowed to work at home. I guess the GM of the site got burned in the past with people ""working"" at home and not doing anything or something, and so we can't work remotely (even though 50% of our workers are 3rd party contractors who work off site anyway)."

I might like to add adjustable thigh support if I’m being picky, but could probably do without. Besides how soft the cushioning is, I loved how the lumbar support goes up and down, not just in and out. In the Subaru/Toyota vehicles I’ve tried with lumbar support, for some reason it’s way too low. It hits my tailbone, not the curve of my back."
