She almost died from alcohol/drug abuse just before Christmas 2017. I travelled the 400 or so miles by train literally 4 days before Christmas to see her in hospital, didn't help she was in the same ICU my nan (whom I love deeply) died in. Somehow she survived a huge heart attack and multiple organ failure. Bear in mind this is the first time I'd seen her in about 8 years.

My brother set her up with a new phone to stay in contact when she got out and the NHS assigned her an alcohol counsellor. Less than a week later she had sold the phone and was drinking again. I get nightmares near Christmas time now because I'm just waiting for the phone call to tell me she's dead. It's fucking awful but you're better off away from that shit. You do you, and if a time ever comes where she's ready to help herself then maybe you can be there for her, not that she would deserve it.

It can be hard to support someone in a career like that because the work is so stressful sometimes, but I had a low stress job so I was able to take on some of that stress. Also I've always had to cook and clean for myself and have a strong stomach so I did a lot around the flat and all of the more disgusting tasks (cleaning the toilet etc.). So we complimented each other well. It didn't work out but her being successful and, by many metrics, better than me was never an issue.
