I place my credentials in my resume after my name (Jane A. Doe, SPHR) and again further down the resume under a header I titled Education & Professional Certifications.  I have a bullet there that reads: Senior Professional in Human Resources (SPHR) – HR Certification Institute.  I don't find it to be an overuse at all. My work email signature also has my credentials listed after my name.  Be proud of your achievement in advancing your knowledge of the profession. Wear it and share it!"

AskHR,ff4m04m,t3_erla1n,1579566852.0,"No, not harassment.  Did you ask him what specifically he meant by the comments?  Don't just read into them.  Ask him."
AskHR,ff4lhvk,t3_eri8r4,1579566503.0,"You say that you showed the text to your supervisor and now you are getting the cold shoulder from the co-worker.  It sounds like your supervisor talked to her and now this is how she is behaving towards you.  If you still feel as though this is a problem, I would recommend you go back to the supervisor and share how her behavior continues to affect your ability to get your job done.  If you see no change from there, I would then escalate to HR.  HR is not going to fire you for speaking the truth about a difficult work environment nor will they think you are a problem.  No one has the right to make the workplace miserable for others."
AskHR,ff4ku90,t3_erkfhz,1579566047.0,"It would be helpful to have more context about how she approached you.  What was her reason for speaking with you about your co-worker?  My guess is that she is aware something is going on with your co-worker and is doing some investigating.  Did she reassure you about any confidentiality (to the extent possible) around your conversation?  From what I can see, her questions seem appropriate.  She isn't there everyday with the co-worker so she is relying on his co-workers (like you) to help provide feedback about him.  Hopefully, she speaks with others as well.  I would not be concerned about it and I don't believe it is inappropriate."
