doordash,ff68jxr,t1_ff5v9sl,1579621664.0,Depends on where you live.
doordash,ff68e43,t1_ff61sl5,1579621558.0,Sounds fishy af. Cooperate with the insurance company and your charge gets dropped?
doordash,ff6855c,t1_ff67n40,1579621391.0,Thanks Dad
doordash,ff3xf2y,t3_erip0l,1579550954.0,"I keep mine in my red bag, next to the food"
doordash,femvtcj,t1_femvo3u,1579270936.0,It's DD having to pay less for base pay. Your being pendantic.
doordash,femvc9z,t1_femmvcx,1579270587.0,"Which will get declined by all the drivers forcing them to up the base pay to get the order accepted; therefore, resulting in doordash having to pay a higher base pay to get the order accepted. It's simple supply and demand."
doordash,feky2ze,t1_fejw9dv,1579209988.0,Of course base pay is affected by the customer tip lol. Most of my offers would be for 3 bucks if it weren't for customer tip. People wouldn't take the orders if the totals didn't include at least some of the customer tip.
doordash,fejoncc,t1_fehtgyr,1579181784.0,You say it's the truth but the only reference your giving is your own logic. Unless you work at DD I don't see how you could have any more information than anyone else.
mildlyinteresting,feiwfbh,t1_feiqz46,1579149063.0,It's especially frustrating for me because I'm frustrated for the both of you.
mildlyinteresting,feivv6s,t1_fein6h5,1579148622.0,These are all real conversations between real people.
doordash,feisz50,t3_epde3s,1579146414.0,"It would result in DoorDash having to up the base pay for the order to get excepted. So, as long as a driver is accepting reasonable orders then customer's cash tip at the end would be an unexpected bonus. Of course DoorDash wants to discourage customers tipping in cash because then DoorDash cannot use customer tips to subsidize driver pay, because if the customer did not tip up front then DD could not use the customer's tip for the initial offer to the driver."
doordash,feht4ik,t1_fehdkey,1579123345.0,"He's saying he was told it's a lottery, but your insisting it's based in AR. How do you know?"
doordash,fehsot2,t1_fehru4o,1579123100.0,A box would probably work though.
doordash,fehs0qf,t1_fehlihz,1579122723.0,I'm afraid I'd get out of the car with a boner.
doordash,fehrwzh,t1_fehqkoc,1579122665.0,"I love how stupid this comment is lol. Thanks, bro."
doordash,fehrppd,t1_fehrhu2,1579122551.0,Children and grown ass adults who don't give a fuck.
doordash,fea5bnw,t1_fe6no4y,1578944535.0,"Great assessment. Sometimes I have difficulty trying to explain how tip stealing is still sort of a thing. And this does it perfectly.  They aren't stealing the tip, but they don't pay the driver as much when you tip good. I'd like to know if when DD begins to up the pay of an order as it gets declined if they are upping their base pay or if they are ""revealing"" more of the tip. Regardless, even if they are upping their pay they still won't need to up it as much if the customer tips well because the order can start with a higher revealed amount (due to padding of customer tip), resulting in it getting passed around less and accepted sooner, resulting in less bumps to base pay."

todayilearned,fe7vuel,t1_fe6jbv7,1578919773.0,"I didn't imply anything and I wasn't speaking to you, so I think you inferred an obligation from a conversation that didn't involve you. I appreciate your input though."
todayilearned,fe6ivz8,t1_fe6iidp,1578892326.0,Thank you for redirecting the conversation away from personal attacks and towards the topic. I agree with what you just said. Did you feel obligated to be proud of their decision?
todayilearned,fe6i4zo,t1_fe6hwlq,1578891631.0,You've crafted quite the story from the few sentences before you. Do you normally operate under so many assumptions?
todayilearned,fe6hi26,t1_fe6h9uj,1578891058.0,But I don't have any cutting scars. Do you know how to speak your mind?

doordash,fe6g3ej,t1_fe6b6bp,1578889841.0,Tony was giving out a tip alright.
doordash,fe6fvbq,t3_enyo53,1578889648.0,"Drivers get your tip, but DoorDash hides the tips and full pay from the drivers, so even if you tip really high you won't really be getting better service because doordash can hide the full amount from the driver.

Also, DoorDash wants you to tip high so they can use customer tips to subsidize their driver pay. If customers tip high then door dash can pay less."
doordash,fe6fpsc,t3_enz2qp,1578889520.0,It sounds like you asked too many questions.
todayilearned,fe6f709,t1_fe6ev8r,1578889090.0,This is what we get for peaking into the colorful brainwashing box.. Back to the senses I suppose.
todayilearned,fe6erco,t1_fe67jty,1578888730.0,It's alarming honestly. I've noticed a trend of suicide shaming on Reddit lately. I don't trust this place.

doordash,fe2wz7l,t3_enoa9k,1578843748.0,DoorDash has actually programmed your subconscious to work yourself while you are sleeping. Good work last last night.
