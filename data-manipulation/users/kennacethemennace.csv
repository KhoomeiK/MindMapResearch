todayilearned,ff8jkv2,t3_es5vd7,1579681501.0,"That's what I don't get. Why is universal healthcare is such a partisan issue. TriCare for the US military is basically universal healthcare. It works amazingly, though it's everyones taxes paying for medical bills belonging to less than 1% of the population.

Honestly, if you're not fucked up in the head or limb after doing 20 years, you're probably healthy enough not needing the VAs assistance. But I guess we could use more money for more contracts."

Jokes,fbiukwu,t3_edghbw,1576914996.0,Father's son + grandmother = Father's grandchild is also Father's sibling. Father's other children will be aunts and uncles to their newborn niece/nephew who will also be their aunt/uncle...? My head hurts.
