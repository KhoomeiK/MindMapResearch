Take a deep breath and do not worry about the lies you told to her (but stop adding more to the pile - that would make it worse). You can deal with that later.  


Just ask her out. Like: ""You wanna do something after school?"" It's more on the neutral side so that she doesn'st have decisive clues about your intent.

The thing is: There's a lot of assumptions in your topic and that can be harmful. Clear your mind and take a risk. I mean, you're not a loser to her - she clearly texts and speaks with you often as you said - so at least she has positive attitude towards you."
