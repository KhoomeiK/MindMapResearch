finance,fdcs7rp,t1_fdcqs5n,1578282804.0,"I broker life insurance nationally, all product lines (term, whole, iul, vul, current assumption with 40+ carriers). Agents working for whole life companies (like Northwest mutual, new York Life etc....) Will certainly highlight the risks to a virtually unfair degree (my job essentially is to help determine what type of product/ sales concept makes sense for every client based on their needs- so I don't particularly care if I'm selling whole, IUL, or VUL as long as it's best for the client- whole life agents very much care which you purchase and will say almost anything to make that happen in their favor). Generally speaking IUL insurance costs are significantly lower than whole and offer greater upside (whole life is a great way to lock in a solid 4-5% rate of return, but doesn't offer the chance to take advantage of years where market performance is strong) , certainly I recommend speaking to a fin advisor who can highlight all the risks/rewards, again speaking very generally if your portfolio includes any bonds you can do substantially better by treating an IUL or whole life policy as your bond alternative."

At it's core IUL is a vehicle that offers tax free growth and tax free distributions with downside risk and capped growth potential ( generally tied to a&p 500 your floor is 0 and cap generally around 12-13%) But....Make sure you don't get a product with ""smoke and mirrors"" like the PacLife PDX.
