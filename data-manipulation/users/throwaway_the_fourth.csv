1. `a == a` for any `a`.
2. `a == b` if and only if `b == a` for any `a`, `b` (where ""if and only if"" means that `a == b` and `b == a` will either both be `True` or both be `False`).
3. If `a == b` and `b == c`, then `a == c`.

These qualities are nice because it gels with how we think about equality: it should be reflexive (#1), symmetric (#2), and transitive (#3).

This behavior of dicts and OrderedDicts fails the third condition. Even though `AO == A` and `A == BO`, `AO != BO`."
