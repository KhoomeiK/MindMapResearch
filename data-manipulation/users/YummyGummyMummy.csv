MovieDetails,fgl6f84,t1_fgkwjpf,1580883603.0,"I get what youre saying. But in regards to the movie, isn't the context of her being a prostitue overtly sexual? That really shouldn't be legal"

todayilearned,fgkzyh3,t1_fgkzkmz,1580877868.0,"My dude, you are doing exactly what you are accusing me of. And it bothered you so much you tried to take a cheap shot at me. I even apologized for having a harsh tone with you, and you still got bitter and shitty. I know youre in ""argument mode"" or whatever, but youre being ridiculous and petty. You dont know everything about everything, deal with it and move on."
AskReddit,fgkzn83,t1_fgkf8xp,1580877619.0,This is probably the best thing Ive read in at least 2 weeks
todayilearned,fgkzgs0,t1_fgkz8pd,1580877480.0,Tell yourself whatever makes you happy. All i said was that you dont know what youre talking about. Im sorry your word wasnt as revered as you hoped it would be.

todayilearned,fgkvvsf,t1_fgkqy66,1580874823.0,"Medication can dull people's livelihoods. I wont deny that. But if it changes someone to that extent then its not working the way it should. Its not something thats supposed to be prescribed willy-nilly. Therapy should come first, medication is for people who are naturally chemically imbalanced.

Medication is not a cure, it should never be looked at as such. Its something to assist you. 

I think its a bit presumptuous of you to blame your friend's personality changes all on medication. That may have been from your perspective, but you're not the one walking in their shoes. Same for other people. 

I dont need someone who has a negative bias towards medication telling me I should look into the long term side effects. Ive been through the ringer with different medications. Its been an ongoing thing in my life. Ive tried to forgo medication all together, only to inevitably have a breakdown. I know what the side effects are, Ive disliked them and stopped for my own benefit when necessary. 

You dont have any personal experience with this at all and are only speaking from an outside perspective. I do apologize for being harsh, but you dont really know what youre talking about."

todayilearned,fgkqhrp,t1_fgklvc2,1580871362.0,"That is such a negative way to look at medicinal treatment. If your medication dampens your life and personality, you should talk to your doctor and find out what works for you.

This kind of talk is what made me hesitant to seek out treatment. This kind if talk makes others hesitant to seek treatment. Think before you speak."

atheism,fgb54ni,t1_fg7hwel,1580658633.0,You call religious people delusional only to circle back and say the same thing about complete atheists when really you couldve just said that about both of them to begin with. I think its super lame seeing people condescend towards others for their religious beliefs AT ALL. Its clear you just like talking down to others and need your ego fix.
TwoXChromosomes,fg7fiq7,t1_fg7ai9v,1580591256.0,Its pretty sad youre exerting your will over another person and acting like it doesnt matter just because youre not doing it in a sexual fashion.

atheism,fg7dqx4,t1_fg7c6zw,1580590039.0,"By being atheist you have faith that there is no god. Sure you might not have a ""religious"" faith, but it still is a belief. You are equally delusional so own up to it instead picking at your opposites."

atheism,fg7ad45,t1_fg6zw1w,1580587736.0,"You dont have any evidence that a deity didnt start the big bang. To some, the big bang could be evidence of a god.

The only thing we can actually prove is that we dont know. Life itself could be indicative of a God. It could also be indicative that everything is random and has no meaning.

You dont have the high ground to call religious people delusional. You want to shoot the shit at an easy target, do it to yourself."

drawing,fg75oe3,t3_ewrkh9,1580584597.0,"Okay, so this is a lot better than what I thought it was based on your post before! Give yourself some credit! I would do what another commenter suggested to do, to put a grid on the image and work by the square. That way you can zoom in and really see which direction you need your lines to go. 

One thing that helps me, personally, is imagining what the body looks like without clothes. Sounds pervy but clothes can really throw off anatomy if youre not careful so I usually just do body then clothes. That way i can be sure that everything ""makes sense""."

I guess guys in my area just literally arent allowed to talk about their own traumas in a support group. Its really fucked how we can offer so many resources to women but almost none to men."

drawing,fg2ycmq,t3_ewkyui,1580461453.0,"Drawing is as much a mental thing as it is a skill thing! It takes a lot of mental practice to figure out how youre going to map things out. Sometimes giving the impression that theres detail is more powerful than trying to map out every little detail.

Unfortunately, unless you post your work all youll get is abstract advice. If you want someone to point out what you can do to improve they have to see what you can do to begin with."

wholesomeanimemes,ffzhn52,t1_ffzhci4,1580379598.0,Its really unfortunate. Its one of the few mainstream medias that actively harbors and supports creeps with pedophilish mentalities. People think that just because its a cartoon child that excuses the fact theyre fetishizing children or young teens. I dont think the rest of us should harbor this kind of shit just because its been wrongly normalized.
