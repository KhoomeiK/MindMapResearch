fatlogic,ffi6qtv,t3_ets22v,1579966561.0,"By eating 1700/1800 kcal a day, I lost 23lb, not cutting diary, beef and gluten, and I fit (I think) a US 8. Truth is: you may have cut certain foods, but surely you eat way more than 1800 kcal everyday."

fatlogic,evsgd2m,t1_evqaabu,1564745309.0,"I was 174 lbs at 5'6"" and I was a lot on the large side, how can she be so delusional?"
