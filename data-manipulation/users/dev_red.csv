It was interesting. I didn't really mind, because I'll hear anything, but it struck me as a ""I'm a new woman so here are all the fun things I'm discovering, fellow woman"". 

It's not going to be a anti-lgbtq thing to not want to hear about sex details. I've been chastised a bit before for saying how sex is generally not a workplace thing. No one wants to know that. I've found though, the LGBT people share a lot more about their identity and sex lives.

The intermittent re-enforcement of sometimes it looking hopeful and them saying they want to work on it, but never really have action for the words. It's enough to keep you breadcrumbing along. It makes sense you feel a bit silly now, too, as it's so clear now. Forgive yourself for 'not seeing it earlier' and all that. Now you know what to look for and how to trust your gut more. 

I recently got out of a similar situation, where ultimately all the talking and begging for communication from him didn't work. Absolutely nothing worked during, and only after I said I can't be with him anymore did that spur any sort of real action..  but not really. I even tried to blame myself saying maybe I don't recognize the actions. I would ask what he was doing or what working on it meant to him. Didn't get much of an answer. Just not really interested in it. Constant emotional neglect and feeling like I was taking care of someone else for two years. I felt pretty stupid too, when I realized that nothing will change. The only change will be not being together. Now I'm totally empty inside because that took so much more out of me than I imagined. Forgiving myself for letting it go on so long is a process."

You stay trapped because of lack of self-esteem or knowing that it can be different. Narcs are experts at knowing exactly how to keep one with them.

One of my exes would get so incredibly angry that he would take the steering wheel from me when I was driving and turn it a bit. Not enough to actually ever cause a crash.. but enough for me to know it was bad. I still was with him though, because he was a raging narcissist and knew exactly how to keep me there.

I sleep with a nice woman pretty much weekly now, and it's a fwb situation. Maybe because my heart is worn out from the break up, but I don't really feel a relationship. I enjoy pleasuring her more than receiving. It's fun! When you have the chance I'd recommend it. It feels.. lighter and more trusting. But that could just be me. 

Since I've done it now, I started looking at more women and actually imagining doing things for them. I ignore men even harder now. I noticed a few years ago too that all my crushes were women despite being with a man."

Worthwhile depends on all three individuals involved."
relationships,fd76atu,t3_ek5zcq,1578199988.0,"I feel like I just went through this little adventure myself. Also 30 but a woman. 

Now I have an attitude of ""fuck it, just going to be myself"" and try not to regret anything I say or something. Because who the fuck cares. Life is short. The planet is on fire. You're going to die anyways. Change if you want, but also just chill. 

I also feel like the weirdo. I'm a woman who is really into computers and so it's hard to talk to people about that. I literally have people excuse themselves as quickly as possible. But some of them stay and it's awesome. You'll meet many more people. You can actively do this as you choose, passively, or take a break from people entirely. 

I just went through a painful break up so it kind of made me more avoidant. Though I'm also going to a sex club next week for the first time so I'm also taking this time to explore myself. I'm also having trouble feeling connected with people so I'm trying different stuff out. Nothing to lose by trying. 

It's just you and your life. You will be more or less self-aware in the moment. You could practice awareness stuff too and mainly take a pause when talking and thinking. Having a lot of friends as adults also seems unheard of. I feel like that's why there are so many bars and adult places to hang out. So we can meet people. School and work is otherwise where you see the same people all the time. It's hard.

Also, one of the greatest places to meet people is at a music festival. There are so many these days. Give that a shot. 

There are a ton of people I butt heads with and it's both of us. Not just me. I don't really care anymore. I'm going to be as kind and empathetic as possible with people and if they're butthurt because I outsmarted them or something at work then I don't care."

sex,fd6oq1i,t1_fd6nts7,1578193888.0,"This is barely about the sex acts, I think. It's about how he's communicating. It seems like he's unwilling to volunteer more information or to help her feel better about it. It's alarming that apparently everything else is so great but this kind of communication!

You and your wife spoke enough to understand those things about each other, so you're both happy. It'd be great if OP could at least have some answers or a path forward with her husband. He doesn't seem willing to walk with her."

sex,fd6l7ph,t1_fd6kyxd,1578192653.0,"No of course not. That's what the communication part is for. That's not an exhaustive list. So far in all of her comments he gives small one wordish answers and doesn't say much. In my experience, it's been those two. May be something else with him then."
