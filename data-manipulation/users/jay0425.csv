depression,fc7pked,t3_egne8q,1577515257.0,Good job! I'm so proud of you :)
depression,fc7ov0f,t3_egn89m,1577514658.0,"I agree with you but I really think you should give life a second chance. You're right about others getting their way and they may have everything handed down to them. But everyone goes through stuff. Everyone. That's what life is. The ups and downs and sometimes there are more downs than ups but don't lose yourself to that. The downs are what makes the ups feel so good. I know it feels like the best option right now is to just forget everything because it feels like your life lost meaning, but I really mean it when I say you'll get better. Things will get better. I don't know what kind of situation you're in right now, but if you have that mentality nothing will be fixed. I'm not asking you to just blindly accept this and suddenly feel optimistic because truth is you won't. But I'm asking you to try. Try for someone or something because I want you to get better. People go through stuff just like you, and giving life a second chance may be the reason you see things getting better for you. Please just know that asking for help is fine. Everyone on reddit will try their best to support you. Please just don't give up."
