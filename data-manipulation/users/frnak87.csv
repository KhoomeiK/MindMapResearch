NoStupidQuestions,fffxckw,t3_et6mos,1579893860.0,"There's a few rules to remember.

If you have a dependent clause at the front of a sentence then you use a comma to offset it. Don't use it if it's at the end.Example:""When I went to the store, I bought milk"" can be rewritten as ""I bought milk when I went to the store.""

You do use them to offset nonessential information but do not use them for essential information.How do you know? If removing the information causes confusion, it needs to be there. For example:  *The tourists* **eating ice cream cones** *were not allowed into the museum until they finished eating.*

You can combine sentences using coordinating conjunctions OR semicolons but you CANNOT combine sentences with commas.

""I went to the movies and she went to dinner""""I went to the movies; she went to dinner""both are acceptable but""I went to the movies, she went to dinner"" is not.

Coordinating conjunctions are easier to remember that they are in the acronym FANBOYS and are 3 letters or less.ForAndNorButOrYet

So

Of course, offsetting dialogue tags, separating lists, separating adjectives that describe a noun,  separating numbers, name of state from city, etc. etc. etc. are all rules too.

But the joining of sentences and the dependent clauses I think are the most abused / misused."
