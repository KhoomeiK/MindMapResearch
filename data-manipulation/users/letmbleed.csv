bjj,fdi8i0k,t1_fdgpxuu,1578437635.0,"I didn’t say there should be no quiet time. I said you can learn to deal with a little noise instead of whining about not having perfect conditions. This isn’t tennis, where they shut everyone up so you can concentrate. You need to man up and get past it. Or don’t. I don’t really care. My training is going fine."
bjj,fdgji0k,t1_fdgj9x4,1578399321.0,"Of course not. I also don’t say that I’m trying to get better at murder. You know, cuz I’m mature enough to know that this stuff ain’t that serious."
bjj,fdggw9n,t1_fdg6t5j,1578396260.0,"I do. I’m a black belt who’s been doing this for over twenty years.  I’ve trained with kids in the room, I’ve trained with annoying rap music blasting in the background,  and I’ve trained in hundred degree weather and hundred percent humidity.  I’ve managed to do it all without whining about background noise. 

Speaking of terrible logic, it’s odd that you go the “no knives or slams” route after claiming that you’re trying to get better at murder."
bjj,fdej9rw,t3_ekuiud,1578340210.0,It’s a good thing there’s no background noise at tournaments or in street fights!

facepalm,fcz4ibt,t1_fcz0lw6,1578093502.0,"Your “thanks for playing” wasn’t meant to imply that you’d won an argument?  Be honest now. 

Where did you see outrage on my part?  You were implying that Obama wasn’t being weak and possibly treasonous because the money he gave Iran was [possibly] just the return of frozen assets. I’d argue that it doesn’t matter. It was a definite sign of weakness."
bjj,fcz044v,t3_ej9s3b,1578090931.0,I’m only half joking when I say that you should’ve mocked her for being a pussy.
bjj,fcyzzt6,t1_fcx0y12,1578090852.0,"Meh. Even if the latter, he did nothing wrong. This isn’t golf. She’s a high enough rank to not whine about something like this."
bjj,fcyzpiu,t3_ejj0tu,1578090669.0,"I’ve had this issue for years. It takes my body a little time to chill the eff out. If I go to bed too soon after training, this happens. I’ve never really thought much of it. I just watch a little tv when I’m done training."

facepalm,fcyxzjz,t1_fcyv41l,1578089559.0,"So you consider that some kind of victory?  That’s kind of pathetic. Whether the payment was a return of frozen assets or a payoff is up for debate. That it was an embarrassing display of the Obama administration’s weak foreign policy, general beta-ness, and borderline treasonous tendencies is not."
facepalm,fcyxo6r,t1_fcyx2wl,1578089356.0,"That’s debatable. The White House’s argument is that it was an act of self defense against an upcoming threat. I’m not an expert on the subject, but from what I’ve seen, and what I’ve discussed with friends who are experts, there is a great deal of debate over whether this type of action violates any laws. Of course, you wouldn’t have heard both sides of the debate, because the news is shamelessly one sided."
facepalm,fcyx0mw,t1_fcywr4q,1578088940.0,"He gave the order for a drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in retaliation for an attack on our embassy in Iran. The killing happened in Baghdad, by the way. Not in Iran."
facepalm,fcywtsi,t1_fcyw8hs,1578088818.0,"My point stands. We don’t need to wait until our citizens are dead in order to respond to an attack.  That’s the Obama/Hillary way. That way doesn’t work.  

Also, let’s not forget that the guy we killed was responsible for the deaths of many Americans.  Arguing that we shouldn’t have killed him is like arguing that we shouldn’t have killed Bin Laden. Though I get that, if Trump has been in office when we got him, the left would most certainly have been outraged. 

And if we’re worried about impeachment and due process, let’s proceed with the impeachment. Let’s now play a political game where we try to hold on to it until we’re able to get the number we need to convict. By your logic, Democrats can keep stalling  til the end of his presidency, and render him unable to do anything at all."
facepalm,fcytflu,t1_fcyhhpj,1578086699.0,He was killed in retaliation for an attack on a US embassy. It’s funny how people keep conveniently leaving that part out.
facepalm,fcytbrn,t1_fcyayla,1578086633.0,"They’re backed by Russia. It’s not impossible that something like this could lead to a world war, but it’s also not likely. This is really nothing too different from what we’ve been seeing for decades now."
facepalm,fcyt837,t1_fcyp2e4,1578086570.0,"Perhaps you aren’t aware that the assets were frozen when Iran took American hostages, and dared us to do anything about it."
facepalm,fcysxvj,t1_fcyrzzv,1578086396.0,"I think some people really believe that we’ve started WWIII. Those people are either uninformed, suffering from severe cases of Trump Derangement Syndrome, stupid, or all of the above."

bjj,fc6aznb,t1_fc5y8re,1577476365.0,"When I was coming up the ranks, we always turned that into a joke. If my friends or I tapped out a higher belt, we’d then immediately go to the bathroom, or start rolling with someone else. Then, when the guy inevitably insisted on another go, we’d say, “ I’m sorry. You’re just not ready yet.”  We’d eventually get an even worse beating, but it was funny af."
CaneCorso,fc4d7th,t3_eg3ylq,1577413278.0,I feed mine kibble mixed with raw.  She LOVES it.
trashyboners,fc1iyuq,t3_ec8ed4,1577320168.0,You guys still following her on Snapchat?  It’s gotten really messed up. Apparently the guy beat the crap out of her because of the picture she posted while high on meds from an endoscopy.  She’s pretty badly busted up.
