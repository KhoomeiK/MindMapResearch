AmItheAsshole,ffc489e,t1_ffc3pzg,1579791138.0,"I didn't scream tirades either, but behind the scenes I was furious.  My boss left the university because of backstabbing and his colleagues were terrible to him, it was extremely toxic.  I enjoyed working with him, and enjoyed the job and I was livid that he was being treated this way.  

When the unemployment agency contacted the place I last worked, they LIED to them and told them I quit voluntarily.  I ran out of funds from one state and claimed benefits from another state.  Again, they lied.  Proves what a shitty place it was.

I did keep my cool though when my boss told me he was leaving and why, but I completely understand feeling betrayed and saying things in the heat of the moment.  I felt like unleashing hell, honestly.  But you're right, I handled it differently, but I don't blame the guy one bit.

Edit to add:  I was sweet and nice to everyone, even the person who was terrible to my boss, only because I was hoping to get another job with the university."
