todayilearned,ff3mzlk,t1_ff1vli6,1579544517.0,"It basically boils down to:

1. Live somewhere where you make more than the median salary, meaning that living frugally results in a fair amount of your salary going into savings.  Depending on what you can do, pick accordingly.  For example I don't actually like programming, hence my desire to retire as soon as passive income allows, but I'm good at it. If I followed my guidance counselors advice to do what I love, I'd be a broke ass History Professor.  Or more likely an unemployed dude who got a PhD history since the market is massively oversupplied with them.
2.  Build up a cash base so that any kind of surprise expense (""Oh the van needs a new transmission and rebuild of the 4x4 system"") can be paid entirely out of your money market/high interest savings account/etc.  That way you never need to prematurely sell stock and pay short term capital gains, cash in a bond early, etc.
3. To reiterate above, avoid short term capital gains taxation at all costs.  
4. Cash salary is also an inefficient want to get paid.  If you're working for a proven company, take enough cash that you can live decently, save that rainy fund up, and pay taxes on your stock when it vests.  Take all other compensation as stock and just pay somewhere between 0 to 20 percent on it (since long term capital gains is income dependent).  

After that invest.  I had a leg up by living in Silicon Valley and knowing where Google and Apple would put their next campuses, so I was able to go in and buy nearby real estate that would massively increase in value, but honestly if you're just plowing money into a pretty standard index fund, bond portfolio, etc you have low risks but you'll end up nicely situated later in life.  Look around for local options that may bring in income (ex: if you live near a major university, renting to students can be profitable)."

todayilearned,ff1lln5,t1_ff1j0vd,1579481182.0,"Did it fresh of college.  I my first five years in the van, then I did a tiny house and went full time remote for just shy of three years.  Drove all over the Americas.  I split my money between boring old index funds and buying condos in the Valley and rented them out (in the Sunnyvale/Cupertino/Mountain View/San Jose area).  I have my own house and should pretty much be set to retire in about 8 more years.  I have 6 years until the last condo is paid off.  Assuming we're not in the midst of another tech bubble popping I do renovations on them as they turn over and then once they're all done, I'm confident they're 100% paid off, up to code, and capable of commanding premium rates I can just retire and live on the passive income.  

The big win was that I was getting Google stock off my first RSU grant as sub 100 a share and didn't need to sell it to help pay living expenses or help pay my taxes at time of vesting.  I only sold at times when I felt I had too much Google and needed to diversify via purchasing real estate or index funds and I always held them long enough to only be on the hook for long term capital gains."
todayilearned,ff1jx00,t1_ff1ijtm,1579480371.0,"The security guards, cafeteria workers, cleaning crew, etc started doing out of necessity, there was simply nothing they could afford on their salary in anything less than a 2 hour commute.  So instead of a bunch of higher end camper vans and such dotting the company parking lot at night, there were full on RVs with entire families.  Google didn't like the optics of that and push the overnight folks off the company lots (now they camp on the public roads leading up to campus) by limiting parking hours.  Starting in 2019 the city of Mountain View started putting in overnight bans on street parking."
todayilearned,ff1brsf,t1_ff16yrg,1579477245.0,"I did at Google for five years.  

Had a nice low profile camper van that I kept things I had an immediate need for in and slept in it for privacy since honestly the nap pods are overrated.  Just on site facilities for hygiene, dining, and exercise.  Either slept in the van or booked a nice hotel room if I had a date go well.  Had a pickup and drop off dry cleaning/laundry service for my clothing.  The savings on food and utilities more than offset the dry cleaning and hotel rooms.

Had a storage unit big enough to keep the rest of my stuff and kept a regular car in it for when I didn't want to drive the camper van around (camper van mostly sat in employee parking).  Most weekends though I'd just drive the camper van to Yosemite/a State Beach/etc and spend the weekend chilling there.

Saved at least 800 a month by doing this (since per person rent varies depending on how many tech nerds you're willing to cram into one ranch house).  Then rents got crazy and it went from being a thing a certain subset of weird tech nerds did to something all the blue collar employees did to survive and they cracked down on it."
news,fela64e,t3_epobdj,1579217425.0,"The other thing is that super weird about this is that the guy sounds like an established customer and the hold up was a hold on his new paycheck.  I had this happen to me once in college and my credit union just let me pull the 700 dollars and waived the over draft fee.  But they also told me if turned out to be check fraud they'd reinstate the overdraft fee and come after me.  Which was fair.

What kind of shit bank won't advance a customer at least a portion of the held check?"
AskReddit,fehsdby,t1_fehlgtc,1579122921.0,"Rather than a blanket ban, I'd propose this.  After the the movie/television season airs, an economist/financial planner/forensic accountant is called in to figure out the expenses of the family.  So groceries, mortgage, replacing cars the kids wrecked as plot points, etc.  From there we can derive the salary of each parent.  For every 5 grand bumbling dad earns over the median salary for whatever region the TV show is set in, the writer has to endure a kick a to groin.  Conversely if you accurately portrayed the lifestyle of what happens when you're a moron, have more kids than you can support, etc, you are free to go.  

So you want to write the trope where bumbling dad can afford a 5 bedroom in an upper middle class neighborhood for him, his stay at home wife, and three kids and still have money for a mid season arc where he takes the kids to Disneyland all on his salary?  Better have balls of steel.  

I always assume the dads aren't bumbling, they're depressed because despite making serious bank and clearly having a successful career their entire nuclear family treats them like shit and belittle them constantly.  Dad needs a divorce attorney and someone who help him understand domestic violence can be entirely emotional."
buildapc,fecnydl,t3_eoghgt,1578978706.0,"There are three potential things you can do right off the bat.

The first is upgrade the RAM to at least 8 GB if you have less than that.  16 can be useful for certain productivity workloads and can be nice if you don't want to have your gazillion Chrome tabs before starting a AAA game.  You have to figure out if you have DDR3 or DDR4, the times on what you have right now, and if you just want to add or redo the RAM entirely.  If you have DDR3, used DDR3 is cheap, especially from local system scrappers.  DDR4 won't be as cheap but is relevant since both current AMD and Intel chipsets use it (so if you upgraded mobo and CPU, prior to the DDR5 chipsets releasing you can carry it forward).  Depending on if you have DDR3 or DDR4 you can google to find out about timings, what your mobo supports, etc.  If you have DDR3 and plan on getting a CPU soon though, just skip right to a new CPU, DDR4, and mobo.

Second I'll assume fairly old means no SSD.  That's a fairly straight forward quality of life improvement.  If your board has an m.2 slot, you can go straight to a m.2 drive.  Otherwise you can get a SATA SSD and copy to that.  Samsung has a nice free disk cloning tool (to copy your current drive to the new disk).  If you buy a non Samsung disk you can find other 3rd party options (or some other manufacturers provide them) or just do a fresh install.  This is a low risk upgrade in that any SSD you buy would be relevant in a new build.  Even if you get a new mobo with an m.2 slot, a SATA SSD is fast enough to run your office applications, older games, etc off.

Third you can do video card and if needed power supply.  This is the tricky one, in if you have a strong enough PSU you can just drop in a new card.  If you have a lower wattage PSU you can drop in a lower end card that doesn't draw as much power, but then of course you're going to want to upgrade that card sooner.  If you do upgrade PSU, figure out what your end game system looks like (so near future CPU, mobo, GPU, etc) and buy a PSU that can support that.  A PSU is something you can carry between builds.

Outside of those stand alone options you can see if there is a legit used CPU option.  If your friend had say a board with an Intel i5, there is an i7 that fits that socket.  You can research into that and used CPU prices to see if there is anything worthwhile there.  Generally though, absent a good deal, it's normally better just to jump to the newest AMD or Intel CPU and also do the mobo at the same time (and possible PSU depending on the wattage and/or RAM if your current build doesn't have DDR4 RAM).  So that's another thing to look into.  If you have an i7, probably no upgrade path without also replacing the mobo.  If you have an AMD FX, your upgrade path is a new CPU and mobo.  Bulldozer was not a good CPU architecture.   

Case of course can be done whenever, as long as this isn't some old whacky Dell/IBM/whatever with a non standard mobo whose mounts don't align with ATX/ITX/etc standard.  If you do your case figure out your mobo size (ATX/ITX,etc) and then buy a case at least that big.  If you want to venture into water cooling or whatever you can buy bigger sized cases, but you can't go smaller than your current mobo."
bayarea,fdfa32x,t1_fdefcyr,1578356840.0,"This morning as my Transbay bus was getting onto the freeway, I noticed the campers had those orange triangles out to close down a lane so they could do bike chop stop stuff on the pavement as the entire shoulder is now filled with tents and crap."
bayarea,fd6nfou,t3_ek596v,1578193434.0,"Banks simply will not extend loans to homes in certain conditions.  So when you go to sell, you'll want to go over that with the realtor and address those things.  This could mean roof repairs, tearing the deck off and just putting in some steps to avoid having the deck hazard pop on the inspection report, etc.  Foundation issues, pest issues, etc can also sometimes be issues.

The other thing to consider is what would you be willing to do.  If Bob wants to buy your house and is putting his entire life savings into the downpayment, Bob can't afford to do the roof.  Bob could however probably afford to finance another 30k in principle on the house and you do the roof (and the roof probably costs under 30k, so profit to you).  So make sure your realtor knows what you'd be willing to do for a commiserate increase in price.  There can also be credit back setups and stuff there cash goes back to the homeowner to cover repairs.  Work that out.

If you want to sell fast though, just clear all the major structure hazards and Section 1 of the pest report."
StarWarsCantina,fd68l1z,t3_ek5b7g,1578187156.0,"For a family, if you have a big enough table and budget X-Wing can be really fun.  That being said the core game pack is literally 2 TIEs vs an X-Wing (or at least it was for v1).  So you have to some serious miniature hording to get up to family sized.  You can either go toward three way battles using the scum faction or go for larger encounters.

Our house rules are Imperials vs Rebels with Scum draftable as mercenaries for a 10% charge over their stated cost.  If you get into the game it makes more sense but in brief each ship, pilot, upgrade for the ship, etc costs points. so if you want to hire Boba Fett you pay a premium.

The other thing there for a family is that means you need a pretty big diversity of miniatures.  Especially since so you can vary starfighter composition between games.  So you need enough minifigs for everyone to have at least a pair and some spare ones not being used.  My kids really got into it, so we have 4 of each ship class and normally folks fly a ""flight"" of the same four fighters, which means I have a couple shelves worth of minis.

The other thing is house rules for command structure, who commands what ships, etc.   I'd also note that in my personal opinion once they got away from kind of the core ships we all saw in the X-wing vs TIE video games there was a break in the meta game.  I'd focus my collection on either the stuff that came after (the K-Wings, ARC-170, T-70 Wing, First Order TIEs, etc) or stick to the core stuff (T-65 X-wing, A-Wing, B-Wing, Y-Wing, TIE Bomber, TIE x1, etc).  The only non X-Wing vs TIE ship I've found I enjoy is the Imperial Raider.  

Star Wars Imperial Assault is also good for a card game that supports folks out of the box and doesn't need house rules for more players.  Star Wars Legion also works, but now you're collecting ground combat expansions instead of starfight expansions, so basically it's which sounds better to you.  

Otherwise two copies of Star Wars Rebellion off Good old Games and some LAN action."
bayarea,fd65jkb,t1_fd3m3w5,1578185827.0,"I mean they should though.  Even if tomorrow we decide to reverse the decades of wage stagnation that most Americans have experienced, labor begins to reorganize for better blue collar wages and perks, and the government begins build/approve the density and mass transit we should have built years ago, it would take 5 to 10 years to really feel the impact.

If a teacher/bus driver/whoever wants to raise their kid in a house/condo they own vs constantly moving apartments, the ability to live near their place of work, the only realistic way they get that is to leave the Bay Area.

They're not the ones who suffer, the NIMBYs pay the price as blue collar labor shortages occur, school class size increases, etc."
