That's what you think. I know what's it like to need these things to feel full. Back in the day I never considered anything meal if it didn't have fries or anything starchy.

When I first tried to live without them I lost my mind. I never felt full and it was horrible but you grow out of it and i swear you never feel better.

I cut out bread pasta fries and anything that's more than 25g of carbs per 100g

It seemed unrealistic but I did it. I had a powerful motivation though. If you have that, itll be easy."

Eat more meat, vegetables, seafood, coffee, green tea. 

Anything but starchy and sugary stuff. They fuck up the chemicals in your brain by giving you a big shot of dopamine while you're eating but then after you're depressed for the whole day.

Starch is stuff like pasta, bread, fries. Google it. Anything you feel bloated easily after."

Find something like people hobbies passions or love to get you started in feeling like your life is not a dead end and theres potential in your life changing for the best.

When you can envision a potential happy future, you'll have meaning and motivation to do the work because you want to, not because you have to. Motivation to be productive in your personal life as well because you want.

Now go think hard on why deep down you're not okay with your life. What's wrong? How can you change that? Find ways to stop yourself from seeing your life as a dead end."

selfimprovement,fcpo7wb,t3_eial4f,1577868556.0,"I've been waiting for someone to ask that.

After years of miserably making resolutions and failing, I realised something so simple and true.

Isnt it stupid to making a goal and start acting like you already accomplished that goal from day 1? 

For example, ""I will eat 5 vegetables everyday"" and you immeidatly start eating 5 a day. 

What you're doing is fooling yourself. Your goal is to be able to eat 5 a day. This is what you're aiming for, not what you're starting with. Its understandable if you cant do it from day 1.

You're not bad if you only start with 1 a day and pick a very comfortable pace to start adding vegetables to your day. 

What you're doing is slowly comfortably training your system to tolerate and like vegetables and someday you'll reach your goal 5 veggies a day.

But ppl still begin at the end and say ""I'm eating 5 veggies from now on and that's it."" That's stupid cause you're shocking your system. I think we do that cause we wanna feel like it's a new year and it's a new chance to be perfect, but that's a wrong mentality. 

Perfection isnt getting everything right from day 1. It's doing the smartest thing you can do at all times.

And the smartest way to change, is by studying yourself and what you're motivated by and what you can tolerate then developing a plan to change exponentially over time.

You keep it a constant 5 veg a day from day 1 and fail and hate yourself.

Or you can start with half a veggie or even 1/8 of a veggie and by getting 1% better everyday. 

If you start with a bite a day (let's say 0.25 of a veggie) you'll end up eating 10 veggies a day by 2021 without realizing it.

Or 37 a day if you start with 1 veggie.

selfimprovement,fcphoaw,t3_eibqls,1577864539.0,"I also understood that concept in the book No Sweat by Michelle something.

It's about eating right and excersizing and it explains how the more energy you spend excersizing the more you can produce energy (stronger)

People think when they tire themselves out, they're weak but it's actually making you stronger."
selfimprovement,fcp8b1b,t1_fcnhsv6,1577853841.0,"What's funny is that I started the new decade by drinking for the first time in my life. If anything for me, it was super inspiring and motivating.

I wont get into it but it was the moment I stopped trying to be perfect in everyone's eyes. Someone who doesnt rely on substances. Ffs I dont even drink coffee cause the caffeine messes with your system.  I wanted to be this perfect sober person who doesnt need substances to function. 

I'm kinda still that person and I dont think I'll drink again, it wasn't much. It was a small glass. I just did it as a moment to show myself that the reason I'm a failure in life is because I dont have respect for myself. I am based on how others will judge me. So when I was shaking and I finally.dared to.take.that sip. It felt like I own my life and I decide what's right for me.

This new autonomy is what unlocked motivation to make my life better. I was always depressed and suicidal before which is way I avoided substances. I knew if I start, I'll never stop. I was depressed because I didn't take care of my life. I didn't want it. I let it rot for many years. I was waiting for death and it was because I never felt autonomy over it. It wasn't mine. It was other people's and their judgments and opinions."
selfimprovement,fcp7s18,t3_ei1wln,1577853322.0,"I came up with the same thing when I was became alone in August and my best friend left me. The last chance i had of having someone in my life.

I was already depressed and done with life and then I was even more depressed to the point where I've realised how to beat depression.

When so much is going on and each area of your life is failing, you feel like it's too much and you're just done but then I made a health plan where I only have to worry about one thing at a time

The first year or two years: physical health

Second: mental health

Third: growth (growing your skills, hobbies and interests)

Fourth: financial (focusing on doing what you really wanna do, not a random 9 to 5)

Fifth: environmental (surrounding yourself and living in a positive non-toxic enviroment)

Sixth: social (genuine friends and relationships)

Seventh (optional): spiritual (formulating a sense of meaning and purpose in your life and of life itself)


That's my decade resolution. My deadline is 2030. 

I at least wanna complete level 4 by 2030. 

Keep in mind that those levels are intertwined with each other. You may not feel like being physical if your mental health is causing you to be depressed. 

That's when you gotta comfort yourself and tell yourself that your depression means nothing and that you'll deal with it later. 

Thats the beauty of this program. You dont get to stress and overwhelm anymore. Your mind is only clear to think about one thing now. Your only worry is ""when am I going for a run"" cause when you're mind is that clear, it's easy to laser focus on one goal and that's how you achieve that goal."

selfimprovement,fc7zvta,t3_eg100i,1577523104.0,"I always thought of myself as ""ugly."" I said I'm one of those people that are fundamentally ugly meaning no amount of effort and working out will change me.

But then I posted myself on r/rateme and I had people telling me I'm a 4 to a 5 to an 8. Clearly something is wrong. People couldn't rank me. I was all the numbers. 

I realised that what makes me attractive isnt a perfectly physical youthful face or whatever. It's all about how people percieve you that makes you attractive.

Here's the secret. No one is attractive by nature itself. Yes. People are attracted to ""pretty"" faces but not because they're ""pretty"" but because society associated that ""pretty"" face with confidence and character and people are attracted to confidence and character, so their attraction to that face gives off an illusion that they're attracted to that face for that face itself but really because it means the person the face belongs to has character and confidence.

So throw away the mirror cause it doesnt tell you squat about yourself. Focus on who you are as a person and your personality and character. That's what makes you dreamy not a meaningless face."
