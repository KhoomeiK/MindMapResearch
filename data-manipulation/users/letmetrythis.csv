""So much different things going on at a high speed"", there are games with the similar idea without these issues. And if you then think about  how much Riot is actually earning... If you take a look at DotA 2, they have voice chat for your whole team, heroes actually communicating with one another, much more active items which means even more things going on, and a lower amount of bugs than League does. You can even reply to your Steam friends (and see their messages) via ingame chat. I'm often having issues with replying to my League friends while ingame."
AdviceAnimals,ffc8vho,t1_ffc707a,1579794202.0,"Nah, flashing is only a warning for something up ahead, either cops or something on the road so you become attentive and lower your speed no matter how fast you're going (you can hardly notice someone's speed from the opposite direction anyway). But if OP wasn't warned, he'd get a ticket, and everyone here is saying how dangerous his speed actually was. In Balkan, on probably worse roads, it's considered ""normal"" to drive 15-20 km/h over the speed limit."

And then we have the ""going 15 miles over, you'll kill someone"". Definitely never heard of in Balkan countries. If you're not driving  15-20 km/h more than speed limit, ""you're a slow poke"" and might get sweared at."

selfimprovement,ff8uhhu,t1_ff8tg4b,1579696511.0,"Hey man, it's a nonzero day type of habit. I've based my habit part on ""mini-habits"", feel free to google about it. It's pretty much the same as telling yourself you'll do ""at least one push-up a day"". Basically, if you tell yourself you'll do 100 push-ups a day, there will be days where you'll say  ""Ugh, way too tired, if I can't do 100, why would I bother doing 1 or 2 push-ups"" and postpone it. But if you tell yourself you'll do at least one push-up a day, then you'll get on the ground, do that one push-up, and when you start, you're already going with it, so why wouldn't you do 10, or who knows, maybe 20? The hardest thing is actually starting, that's when our mind is talking ourselves out of it, after you start it's a lot easier. There's a book ""The slight edge"" which talks about it.

So, the same is with at least one page a day. Be it e-book or a normal book, once I start reading, it's always more pages than that one. But even if I don't feel like it, as you've said, one page is better than none, it's about building a habit. Now when I'm having some extra time not doing anything, instead of opening Instagram or FB, I open Readera on my phone and read a few pages. It adds up :)"

For habits use Loop Habit Tracker. After you create a habit in it, you can use a widget on your home screen, which you can press when you have finished your habit for that day, in the same what that widget serves as a reminder. It's perfect. I've been using it for quite a while, currently going strong, 99 days of ""read at least one page of a book per day"".

Another option is Habitica RPG. Basically, you have your avatar, by doing tasks and habits you get experience and level up, if you fail to do them, you lose HP. It's based on gamification, works really well. Also there are specific habit guilds which can serve for accountability.

For To-Do list, I'd recommend Todoist. If you connect it to your Google Calendar (you can do that in the browser version of the app), you can set your Google Calendar to remind you one hour before a task. That way, you get a free version but with reminders, worked great for me so far."

If you want help, do this: break up with your boyfriend right away, your relationship isn't good and your boyfriend deserves to know that. You're looking for attention from a guy you know less than your boyfriend. I realize all of you are still young, but the earlier you learn this, the better. Don't make a fool out of a person you're in a relationship with. That stuff hits you back when you least expect it.

relationship_advice,fejtrri,t3_epjyse,1579185662.0,"First thing I noticed is that you didn't give yourself any time after that break-up before getting into a new relationship, to just be with yourself. I'm not gonna get into that anyway, as that's not the issue here. BUT, you need to treat that trauma. You deserve it, and your boyfriend deserves it too. Have you talked to him at all about it, does he know? Due to the trauma so young, you have probably blocked those sensors to actually cope with all that. That seems shown by you not showing any emotions or compassion. Definitely look into therapy, as soon as possible. You're quite young, and the sooner you treat that trauma, the better.

You've gone through a lot, abuse is not something that you can simply just let go, especially those you've suffered through. And to be honest, it's not that ""due to being exposed to sex at young age it has become a meaningless thing"". Due to trauma connected to it and due to the abuse, you did the only thing a child can do to cope with it, shut down any feelings that come with it. Once you treat that trauma, you'll be able to enjoy sex and everything about it. It'll take some time, but don't let yourself wait, tell your boyfriend about this, tell him that you'd like to seek therapy, due to the abuse you're not able to let that trauma go, and since he sounds as a great person, he'll be as supportive as he can be. Also, those deep, dark thoughts that haunt you are also connected with all of this. All of this is bottled inside of you, and therapy will be the way to open up that bottle and let it go.  
Good luck, and I wish you and your SO the best in following years of your lives, don't let the trauma win :)"
relationship_advice,fegrdfg,t1_fegqv44,1579100749.0,"I believe you man. Sometimes it's good to remember that we aren't able to control other people's reactions. But at the same time, we shouldn't be walking on egg-shells just to avoid that reaction completely, that won't make you happy in the long run. Real relationships get built in those storms and arguments. If they don't, it's not the one for you. Keep your head up buddy, you seem like a great guy. :)"

You're afraid of being honest yourself, you're afraid of hurting her feelings (because at the same time, you're protecting your own feelings as well), so it makes it easier to just ""go-with-the-flow"" and not rock any boats. Best question is, do you think you deserve normal, functional loving relationship without stupid games? If you want to act as a man, you'll have to make decisions. Being indecisive won't help you (trust me, I've been there), every action you do will move you forward as a person. Sometimes your decisions will be wrong, sometimes they'll be right, but every time you own up to it and learn from it. Just like in this case."

DecidingToBeBetter,fed2nhp,t1_fe96f1u,1578995703.0,">The aggregate response (as reflected in a system like upvoting/downvoting) would be inverted if a female Op made an identical post about her partner not loving her anymore after she gained weight during a period of grieving a parent - the response would be  *strongly* to the effect of, well, what I said it would be, which you seem to recognise

You do realize that OP didn't go make a (sad) post about how ""his partner doesn't love him anymore after he gained weight during a period of grieving a parent"", right? If OP, as a man, simply and only wrote what you said, he'd get the exact same support as a female OP would (get a divorce, hit the gym etc). Yeah, this is Reddit, 90% of relationship advices are ""you deserve better, break up with him/her, relationships can't be fixed"" etc. OP never said how much time has already passed since those events happened. Sometimes you need the person next to you to be your reality-check. Maybe she's been supportive for who knows how long, and can't stand it anymore. Your point, in the linked comment, is basically saying ""yeah, keep feeling bad, don't improve yourself for someone else"". Let's say OP likes to gamble. He says ""yeah, gambling is so much fun, sometimes I lose our family's money and then we all suffer, but it's fun"". Would it still be okay, in your earlier point, for OP's wife to be ""supportive, in better or worse""? I know it's not the same, but you get my point. This was his wake-up call, and even the OP himself said that he'll get better himself not depending on if they'll stay together or get divorced."
