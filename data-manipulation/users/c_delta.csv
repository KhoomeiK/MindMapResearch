Still a bit of a holy war, especially when you have something that is not constrained by address space, like storage on a linear track (magnetic, optical and such) or data transfer rates. Which is why the IEC introduced ki in the 1990s (pardon, in the 0x7C0s) to avoid the inherent ambiguity of using the same prefix for base-10 and base-2 orders of magnitude. While professional standards have usually come around to avoiding the double use of metric prefixes, the IEC convention has not caught on universally - particularly OS vendors tend to stubbornly stick to using GB when they mean GiB, while hard drive vendors, through a combination of hard drives not being overly concerned with powers of two and larger numbers selling better, prefer to advertise decimal GB instead of GiB.

I expected as much. Anything else would be rather negligent. The reasons you are not going to find one here are not so much electrical safety as they are related to the design of our wall plates and plugs. Wall sockets tend to be a bit bulkier, and the plate design is very modular - a large frame with individual plates inside for stuff like switches, outlets, dimmers or blank covers, along with other, more modern features. I could certainly see one AV plate and one outlet plate mounted to the same frame, but going to different holes in the wall.

That said, in-wall A/V is by no means a common feature outside of office buildings, since a lot of homes have solid walls, with cables routed through slits carved into the brick or concrete and then plastered in. In-wall conduit exists, but is an expense many shy away from. I have seen people routing cables through the wall for a mounted TV, but that was in a relatively modern building and the duct was basically a pipe that sat flush with the wall on both ends, no special socket mounted."

DIY,fexhygx,t3_equ14f,1579431302.0,"The page is a bit hard to read for non-Americans, but it says ""15 Amp, 125-Volt tamper-resistant outlet"". 

One interesting tidbit about ""low voltage"" is how context-dependent it is. It means ""less than 1000 V"" to power engineers (and electricians), which is a bit counter-intuitive for home users for whom mains voltage tends to be the highest voltage they encounter on a regular basis. Anything that is low enough to be safe to touch is known as ""extra-low voltage"". Meanwhile, in microelectronics, 12 V counts as ""high voltage"" at times.

Edit for clarity (along with some rewording of the above):

Therefore, when looking at electrical installations, it is best to look for other cues rather than just a label of ""low voltage"" or ""high voltage"", since that meaning changes both depending on the industry the label is from and the local standards whereever you are. A/V, telephone, networking, all those communication lines are usually SELV and should be sufficiently insulated from anything whose voltage can be a shock hazard, like the mains. Mains plugs and sockets should never be used for safe-to-touch wiring, lest someone mix them up. 

In your case, the fact that a NEMA 5-15 socket is used on the outlet, along with the specified voltage rating of 125 V, outlines that receptacle as suitable for wiring to a typical North American electrical supply. But for any work on installations, if you are not sure what you are doing, speak to someone who has the necessary qualifications to work on installations where you live. I am not sure about the USA, much less your particular corner of it, but in my corner of Europe, adding a new wall outlet will at least legally require the installation to be signed off by a licensed electrician."

That however means that green also makes a great reference to distinguish what part of the image to cut out, since green is the clearest color you have. Furthermore, green is pretty far away from most natural human skin colors, so you have less of a chance of accidentally cutting away part of someone's face.

The latter is also part of the reason why blue is sometimes used. Back when cameras were still analog, the individual colors were not as different in clarity as they are now. Blue is also far away from natural skin colors, but it is also, unlike green, far away from natural vegetation colors, and it had some advantages regarding chemical film by being an extreme wavelength."

The Wehrmacht, on the other hand, were what the German army became under Nazi rule. Since a lot of Germans of that time were Nazis, they answered to a Nazi government and the high ranks had a disproportionate amount of party members, it is fair to say that the Wehrmacht both qualifies as *the* German army and *a* Nazi army (but not *the* Nazi army since that is the Waffen-SS). The Wehrmacht was a mix of enthusiastic Nazis, conscripts and people who just wanted to defend their home.

The fact that they were not the Waffen-SS was used in the post-war period to create the ""clean Wehrmacht myth"", that the average soldier was probably not responsible for any major crimes because those acts would have been handled by the SS. Mostly to help people whose loved ones were soldiers cope with the realization of all the evil committed by German troops.

OnePiece,fd8kh2h,t1_fd6i6lm,1578219461.0,"Take a look at other Japanese kids' shows, and how they use 獣.

One example that comes to my mind is Super Sentai. The most straightforward example would be Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger, an animal-themed team, which includes anything from fiece creatures like tigers and polar bears to wildlife with more gentle reputation like deer or elephants. Doubutsu Sentai Zyuohger uses ""animal"" and ""beast"" in the same title, and contains a similar, although less vast, mix of animals. On the other hand, Kyoryu Sentain Zyuranger and Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger (yeah, very clever there, Toei) use beast for things like dinosaurs and sabretooth tigers, which tend to have quite a fierce reputation, though brachiosaurs and such less predatory ones tend to be included in the teams.

Point is, ""beast"" and ""animal"" are pretty much synonymous in the sense in which they appear in expressions like Hyakujuu. Wiktionary lists the top definition of ""beast"" as ""Any animal other than a human; usually only applied to land vertebrates, especially large or dangerous four-footed ones."". The word ""beast"" itself is derived from the Latin word for animal, *bestia*. And those beastly Sentais, at least those which feature present-day animals, also include stuff like apes and sharks and eagles, so both bipeds and non-land animals are represented. Kaido's crew is quite short on sea dwellers for the obvious devil fruit reasons, but there have been airborne gifters and invertebrate ones.

Point is, ""animal"" is not that different from ""beast"", but while Juu's Kun reading ""kemono"" literally translates to ""hair thing"" or ""furry"", clearly all kinds of animals, furry or not, are part of Kaido's crew, and ""beast"" is clearly meant to imply ""non-human animal"" rather than ""brutal being"".

Bottom line, I do not think ""animal kingdom"" is a perfect translation by any means, because with all the kids' shows featuring cute and cuddly animals, it comes across as a bit softer than Kaido's crew is. Also, most pirate crews in OP are named after the leader's epithet, so if Kaido is King of the Beasts, it makes sense for that same word ""beast"" to appear in the crew's name. But I find it quite a bit less jarring than, say, Zolo (which totally ruins the fact that his name is a thinly-veiled Zorro reference). And it is not like they could not have done worse than ""Animal Kingdom"". Imagine if Kaido headed the ""Bunch'o'Furries Pirates"".

And yes, TL Notes for the win. Some people want to learn about other places, especially with all the references to Japanese culture in Wano. It is not like the translated version of Wano is based on the ""alternative history California"" from Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney."
