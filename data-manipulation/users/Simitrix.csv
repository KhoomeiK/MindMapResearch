The reason I quit was coz there was just not much content but now you can easily lvl with quests(to 61 and the story is also nicer), there's dark rifts that take a few min if you're not in full tet/pen already and are pretty fun with good rewards. Lifeskilling is million times better if you're into that(added bartering which is fun) and same with marketplace as he said and new continents- you'd have plenty new things to explore just as it is right now.  
Honestly I think it depends how much you enjoyed playing whichever class you had, if you were really into it, then just continue and if not then can make a new one..it won't REALLY matter  
The whole ""p2w"" shit people are saying is just whatever unless you want to be in top guilds with top gear. You can EASILY play without spending much-my bf made a new char now that we came back and hasn't spent, grinding and making money without issues(silver no longer takes up weight) and before that he bought his pets from mp+got them from events. So yeah if you'd come back then I'd suggest you take it slow and find something you enjoy even if it's not meta and what not  
Hope I could help \^\^"

The images from the vet office are still playing when I try to sleep, but I am trying to find comfort knowing that he had an amazing life, even if it was cut short and how we absolutely showered him with love every single day. 
I'm so sorry for your and OP's loss, hope you'll manage to find peace soon"

We'll give him a nice burial tomorrow with his favourite toys and blanket in the box with him and say our goodbyes"
