todayilearned,fciubra,t1_fci4y02,1577669996.0,"The white is to reflect the light so you don't need as many lights to make the rooms seem as bright.  Big rooms, with black cabinets you'd need a lot more light and a lot more power (granted, the power for the lighting is just a drop in the bucket compared to critical load).

The lack of markings is just more that the people that typically work in a DC understand where they are and less about security measures to prevent people from finding their way out.  You're never really letting a random walk around the data center unescorted and realistically there isn't much they are going to be able to run off with.  The sites are usually set up in a grid format and it's very intuitive when you are used to it.  

All real data centers have hot and cold aisle, servers pull cold air from the front and exhaust in the back so you place racks essentially back to back.  There are two schools of thought for containment, hot or cold.  It's usually dictated by what would make the facility operate more efficiently.  Raised floor environments it's pretty easy to just do cold containment with doors on the ends of the rows and top panels on the cabinets.  You have to take fire suppression into account in either.  

The massive massive solar panel farm across the street likely only produces enough power to run some of the lights and normal house power and doesn't really power the servers.  It's literally just to check a mark that they are using some ""green"" power.  These buildings are around 32 megawatts of critical load and with more needed for essential load depending on the PUE"
todayilearned,fcitj2z,t1_fcilo33,1577669454.0,It's actually very uncommon in most data centers to use any type of gas for fire suppression.  Especially sites the size of apple.  There are rules on how far you can be from a door and how many people have access to the facility to even allow gas.  What's typical is a system like VESDA combined with dry water suppression lines above.  Rather than worrying about fire suppression more measures are taken to ensure there are no combustable materials in the data center and fire walls.
