infj,felzub5,t3_epihd9,1579235290.0,"Interesting question. I took a self-assessment (which was given to me by a therapist) once and the results stated a had a high level of ""self-sacrifice"" which could be viewed as problematic. I do feel that I self-sacrifice in general. It's not so much because I'm trying to please people, but I often feel that I'm in the position to sacrifice- I often think of who's in the most need in any given moment and if it's the other person, I will sacrifice (as long as it doesn't put me in harm's way).

In the past I had a relationship that could be seen as codependent, but after I went to therapy I went to therapy that hasn't been an issue in romantic relationships. I think the previous experience was due to growing up in a household where my parents' feelings were more important, so it was necessary to focus more on them. 

Nowadays I don't have many romantic relationships because it's not something I feel that interested in. When I have gotten into relationships recently, I can feel smothered pretty easily and I like my independence."
dyscalculia,fehn825,t3_ep79ev,1579119965.0,"Haha. I used to have my older brother help me and he'd always get frustrated with me and say, ""We just went over this the other day. How do you not remember?"""
infj,fehiiaq,t3_ep0em7,1579117232.0,"Yes, I feel the same way."
hsp,fdr7c3e,t3_emk5tr,1578680525.0,"For me, I try to look at headlines and keep up with current events that are related to need and/or requires change and decide which stories to read more about; I read an article once saying that from an evolution standpoint, the HSP gene gives people the ability to recognize when to take action when there are disasters, social matters, etc. Although there's a lot of suffering going on in the world that I won't be able to alleviate, I do want to look for things that I can do to help and I'm only able to do that if I know what's going on in the world. This doesn't necessarily mean that I have to watch the news all day. I might sign up to stay informed about a nonprofit campaign that I can volunteer with.

I remember watching an interview many years ago of an elderly woman who was living in a war-torn area. She said she understands that we might not be able to help, but she just wanted the world to be aware of what she and her family are going through. I want to see these people who feel unseen. And if it becomes too much emotionally, I might practice a loving kindness meditation where I'm focusing on sending out love for those suffering.

I do think it's important that we all practice self-care and are mindful of what feels like too much for us because although we want to help everyone, we can't help anyone if our own mental health isn't taken care of first. Personally, I need ""down time"" throughout the week where I just have quiet and can meditate, but I will try to keep up on news for the reasons I stated above.

Best wishes to all of you."

dyscalculia,fde66kk,t1_fddefyg,1578332049.0,"Yes, I know what you mean. During my first week of working in retail my cash register was actually short and I had no idea why. Thankfully they didn't fire me, but they did print out every transaction I made that day and asked me to circle any mistakes I made (which wasn't easy for me to do given the dyscalculia). I think it would have given me some peace of mind to use a calculator while I was working."

dyscalculia,fd5vgyd,t1_fd400cv,1578181996.0,"I agree. I think that learning about its existence and what to watch for should be taught to anyone going into teaching. My teachers never mentioned it and they treated me like I was just a bad student. In elementary school I would often show up with the math homework incomplete and the teacher would place me out in the hallway for the entire class (which doesn't help when you have a learning disability). 

Then in high school my math teacher encouraged me to switch into a home ec class saying, ""Just because you do the homework doesn't mean I'm going to pass you."" 

No one ever mentioned the possibility of dyscalculia."

PMDD,fcs3uas,t1_fck889t,1577911071.0,"I think part of the issue is that some people have been diagnosed as PMDD and it has felt (to me anyway) like there's been some judgement that maybe that person doesn't have PMDD and it's just PMS.

If someone is questioning whether they have it then I like the idea of a flair but I also find it helpful to keep in mind that we have no idea whether someone has already been diagnosed (unless they say so) and what their journey has been. I've recently become uncomfortable posting here for that reason.

I like the new flair comment that was posted today. I think that will be helpful for the community."

dyscalculia,fcobmff,t1_fcob208,1577828275.0,"Good luck! I hope that you can find someone who can help you. It took me a long time to figure out that I have dyscalculia because, like you said, a lot of people don't know about it. Don't give up."
dyscalculia,fcoau7y,t1_fco5h3i,1577827731.0,"I'm not sure what resources you have available near you. I had my testing done through a university's Counseling and Psychological Services department. It would be difficult to know for sure without being tested, unfortunately."
dyscalculia,fco535s,t3_ei75sn,1577824238.0,"Hi, I'm sorry that you're going through that. I can relate to that frustration. Is there someone at your school that you can talk to about getting tested for dyscalculia, like a counselor?"
dyscalculia,fcngs1u,t3_ei4oct,1577811391.0,"Hi, I'm glad you're able to get tested soon. As for financial aid, I don't think it will be affected either way and most likely the grading scale won't change (at least in my experience). When I got tested, the person who did the testing made specific recommendations for accommodations that they felt would help me and then I had to meet with my school's disability office for them to approve the accommodations. It could be things like extra time, taking the test in a separate room, being able to use a calculator on the exam, being able to use notes, etc. But it will be up to your school to decide the appropriate accommodations for you if it's determined that you have dyscalculia. Best wishes."

Recently I've seen that some states have changed which subjects are required for the certification exam and math has been replaced with other topics (like ethics)."

PMDD,fck6w5m,t3_ehmx89,1577718268.0,"For me, I just keep in mind that like you said, I don't know the severity of what people are going through and I don't want to invalidate anyone's experience. I think for some folks it's tough to even put into words how bad things can get. I've always had a hard time being open with my feelings and describing how bad I'm feeling. I'm used to downplaying it and isolating myself. 

I haven't read anything that indicates measuring hormone levels would be helpful for PMDD but maybe in the future science will be advanced enough to be able to track something specifically for PMDD."
Buddhism,fcjxf53,t3_ehjh9q,1577709255.0,"I like the way that Pema Chodron explains it here: “First we acknowledge what we feel – shame, revenge, embarrassment, remorse. Then we forgive ourselves for being human. Then, in the spirit of not wallowing in the pain, we let go and make a fresh start. We don’t have to carry the burden with us anymore. We can acknowledge, forgive and start anew. If we practice this way, little by little we’ll learn to abide with the feeling of regret for having hurt ourselves and others. We will also learn self-forgiveness. Eventually at our own speed, we’ll even find our capacity to forgive those who have done us harm. We will discover forgiveness as a natural expression of the open heart, an expression of our basic goodness. Each moment is an opportunity to make a fresh start.”"

dyscalculia,fcjwdow,t3_ehk51g,1577707943.0,"I don't know if other people find this helpful, but I like to use different colors for things because it helps me keep things straight, like how it's done in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVYwunbpMHA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVYwunbpMHA)

When I was in my math class I would watch a lot of videos and would pause and sometimes replay certain parts so that I could understand. And I'd need to pause again to think about what was just said.

I also find example problems extremely helpful with written instructions next to it. For example, if you had an example problem that showed each step, with the numbers in different colors or highlighted, and next to it you write out what you just did for that step. Then you could write out another problem that's very similar for her to do on her own using your example right next to it. For me, I would need to go back and look at the example over and over each time I did a problem."
