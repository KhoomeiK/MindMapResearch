I maxed out the target distance, put all of my (limited) training into practice, took 3 shots nearly 20 seconds apart, and was floored with the results! I'll get a new hand before I get a new gun, lol."

bipolar,ferthmh,t1_ferqzk2,1579358225.0,"I'll need to finish reading the book. I only got to the part where she started having psychotic episodes. I started off as creative, but it slowly turned into a numbing psychosis. Now I can't generate an intuitive thought of my life depended on it. It's all just irritable loops and noise. The spending, I believe, comes from the impulsivity of the disease, which also fuels the grand ideas. 
You're doing very well keeping chemicals out of your body. I understand, too, that medications are hit or miss. However, meds are important, especially if you're feeling irritable. This is coming from a guy who stopped taking meds and watched with twisted glee as the world burned around me. There's good people in this sub, you'll find nothing but love and friendship here. I know I have."
bipolar,ferqfdr,t3_eqewga,1579357164.0,"Weed, alcohol, and other dopamine blockers can cause that as well from my experience. It skips straight to psychosis and irritability. Leaving creativity in the dust. Are you taking any medications? Talk therapy?"

bipolar,ferncuj,t3_eqdils,1579356075.0,"I've been going public for a few months and I've noticed the further I go away from my inner circle of family/friends, the more vitriol I get from people. There's a core lack of understanding of mental health in the United States. Culturally, Black Americans have a hate-hate relationship with doctors and clinicians in general. So I find it best to only involve my inner circle. 
Of course, when I'm manic, I don't know how to shut tf up so at that point, errrbody and their momma is going to hear about it lol"
bipolar,ferm24y,t3_eqbgek,1579355674.0,Don't be so hard on yourself Friend. Bi definition (seewhatIdidthere?) we're going to experience the downs along with the ups. Now it's your turn to be cared for. Breathe. Sleep. Drink water. And soak up the love and inspiration coming your way.

bipolar,fepcz70,t3_eq8xuz,1579317477.0,I'm on 900mg of Lithium daily. Doc just prescribed 25mg of Seroquel b/c I'm still not sleeping. Hope it works well for the both of us. Good luck out there
Glocks,fepa2zr,t3_eqameo,1579315533.0,"To add to the already great advice: the amount of rounds you send downrange mean nothing, and will probably reinforce bad habits. Front sight focus, dry fire practice will save you money."
bipolar,fejugp7,t3_epco6s,1579186119.0,Do you have one that was drawn before meds? Interesting to see how our self-image has evolved once our minds are quieted. Great work!

bipolar,fcuyemo,t1_f93tu5g,1577991007.0,"Just had my first psych meeting today & was prescribed lithium again after years on non-compliance. The number one side effect of bipolar disorder in general is feeling like you're in more control than reality, and we just stop taking meds based on that false sense of control. Don't be hard on yourself if you feel like stopping without a cause. Try to have a proper support group to call you out on your shit & make sure you're still on your meds. Good luck out there."

Going to see the case worker who has helped my son, and ask for assistance for myself. I appreciate you kind strangers for helping me cut through the noise in my head. I'm still cycling every couple of hours, but I have more hope than tears now, so off I go."
