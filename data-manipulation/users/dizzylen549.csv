bipolar,ffdy9ck,t3_eszzgt,1579831918.0,I didn't start gaining until I was at a much higher dosage.
bipolar,fds5nfd,t3_emvvbi,1578694904.0,"I am fortunate to have an incredibly supportive partner. Depending upon which side of the curve I go extreme on, we have a plan for a credit card check-out system so I don't overspend, a preset schedule to tru and get sleep, locking up all sharps and meds, he administers my meds. I've signed permission for him to talk with my psych and therapist (2-way) but trust that he'll only do it when necessary, and hospitalization is a last resort."
bipolar,fdpqx8c,t3_emkdp0,1578637115.0,"I used to be on Seroquel but couldn't handle the stupor and still ended up cycling. I was on 400mg twice a day. I am now on lamictal, lithium, and rexulti.  It has taken a lot of trial and error to figure out this concoction which has kept me stable for about 6 months."
SkincareAddiction,fcsi1t8,t3_eilqz6,1577916905.0,I use it and I don't dislike it but I wouldn't claim that it does anything fabulous. I'll finish with what I have because my skin is doing well with it (in combination with other serums and such) but I don't think it is worth a repurchase. I use the orange cartridge for fatigue with the oil free moisturizer in the morning and the blue cartridge for texture with the dramatically different moisturizer at night. I have been using this combo for about 3 months but didn't notice any real change in texture or dullness until I added a separate serum.
bipolar,fcf05wh,t3_eh0cw5,1577625339.0,I wish you all the best! IOP was a great environment for me. I hope it works out well for you and you get the help you need.
