NonZeroDay,ffd77cx,t1_ffc6549,1579814761.0,"I know it's hard but you'll find out who your allies and advocates are if you can push yourself with this bit of vulnerability. It will feel rewarding to get positive responses. And I'm sure your teachers would rather have you tell them that something is off because you've been feeling off rather than having to guess, and maybe concluding that you just don't care about their class or them."
NonZeroDay,ff9gpwd,t3_es5xtn,1579712649.0,You can do it! Even part of the assignments is better than nothing. And maybe talk to your teachers and tell them how you've been feeling?

loseit,ff4r72x,t1_ff4r21x,1579570483.0,I feel like this post would do better as its own thread? That way it will be more searchable. Would you mind un-hiding it?
TwoXChromosomes,fevr328,t1_fes5yvi,1579400489.0,There are some things with therapy that suck at first but you have to feel to process. But also shop around until you find a therapist that works for you!
TwoXChromosomes,fevnula,t1_feva5mh,1579399505.0,Oh idk she was getting pressure from a grown ass man and her dad acted like it was ok? The man that she probably pictures when thinking of a protector suddenly revealed to her that he's not worried about her being in a situation that makes her scared or uncomfortable?
TwoXChromosomes,fevnock,t3_eqp86l,1579399431.0,I would strongly recommend talking to him honestly about how he made you feel. He might not realize how much you still need him and how his reaction felt.
NonZeroDay,fepcntz,t3_eq56fy,1579317261.0,"I used to cry for no reason and then I went on depression medication and it helped. Also, try just making one call at a time. You don't need to do all the calls at once."

weddingshaming,fegsf45,t1_fefboyj,1579101456.0,My ex husband was just like this. It was infuriating and exhausting.
weddingshaming,fegscss,t1_feeqrma,1579101414.0,Can almost guarantee it's not an act. His behavior is ridiculously reminiscent of my first husband.
