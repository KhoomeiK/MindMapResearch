I remember reading a British ww2 study on the effectiveness of artillery for the amount of shells that would cause almost 100% casualties to standing men would only cause something like 5-10% to people in a basic foxhole.  This is why people began working on ToT barrages as the first shells to land will cause by far the most damage.  Its also why modern artillery is so nasty, in ww2 it might land 50 yards away on the first shot giving people time to jump into cover,  modern stuff might land within 10 yards."

Canada also has the highest amount of Ukrainians among western countries so their would be a larger amount of flights going to Canada from Ukraine anyway.
