translator,ff03qd7,t1_feyu8w8,1579464823.0,"I was actually trying to figure out which LT's those were from the description. Your comment jogged my memory of something I had read a long time ago so I did some Googling. According to [these](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Trivia/GuardiansCrusade) [three](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197501-guardians-crusade/faqs/4740) [sources,](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/197501-guardians-crusade/75447853) there is a Russian Roulette LT called ""Rust Bucket"" that was censored out of the American release. I would bet  that is what we are looking at in the top picture. The katakana in the menu seems to confirm that this LT would be near the other ""R""-named LTs.

As for the second, if you read through the thread that I linked above, you'll find this little gem:

> I did actually just moments ago discovered an unused LT in the Japanese version through messing around with a hex editor, (...) its name roughly translates to ""Equal"" (...) he kind of looks like a balance scale with legs and his effect is making anyone who deals damage also take the damage they deal

So that probably accounts for the second one. Again, looking at the katakana in the screenshots, a name starting with ""E"" would fit in there as well. Hope I might have helped a little."
