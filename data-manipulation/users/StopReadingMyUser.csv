I've called many people the wrong name. Including my first girlfriend... for 3 months...... we're no longer together.

I once tried to help an old lady in a scooter at walmart reach some mac'n'cheese by comically ""running to the rescue"" only to twist my ankle and curl up in agony on the floor for several minutes while my friend yelled at me to get up.

I wore a windbreaker, flip flops, and a tucked-in T-shirt (complete with a belt) for nearly a year in college. I also drove around on a manual kid's scooter, but that was dope and everyone was obviously hella jealous even though no one else had one.
