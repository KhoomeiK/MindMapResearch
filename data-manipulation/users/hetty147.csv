However, what I called shit was that post. And since you’re by far not the first one to post it, it’s definitely not your original post. So no, it’s not personal. Learn the damn difference. 
Oh and btw, I swear a lot. Always have and always will. What’s with people online getting offended by “bad words”. They’re just words"

Seriously if you can’t handle people getting annoying over a post they’ve seen at least 15 times on this subreddit just don’t post."
