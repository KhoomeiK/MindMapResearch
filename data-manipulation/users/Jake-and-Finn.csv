The reason I say it's shitty is because they broke tons of shaders. Active camo, glass, the covenant dropship, water, etc. And they also messed up the fov and didn't support widescreen so the UI is really stretched. It's just poorly done. But God I love it so much."

When you walk around with a skirt or a dress made of such a material it clings to you really bad and doesn't look right. A slip is a garment, usually a very thin skirt, that is just a little shorter than the main skirt, and it doesn't build up static. It acts as a buffer so everything moves smoothly. Body shapers like hers can also act as slips."

pcmasterrace,ff8vdl2,t1_ff8r81r,1579697374.0,"It's not hard, per se, but it does add more complexity and takes time and money during development to make initialization code more flexible so that it can run outside of the initialization phase of startup.

My friend's dad is (was? Don't know these days) a beast at ping pong and he would spin it almost every time. He'd hit it going really fast and it would almost stop on the table with backspin or he'd hit it with a forward spin and it would bounce and shoot forward. He could also curve it side to side.
