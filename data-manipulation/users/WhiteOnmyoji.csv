This is a Games Workshop Retailer policy:  Retailers must provide clearly-marked GAMES WORKSHOP shelf-space. The BV Products (along with any other GAMES WORKSHOP products carried by the Retailer) should be segregated in the store and not intermingled with other product brands. 

Fantasy Flight is also owned by Asmodee, which owns other games publishers like Plaid Hat Games, Days of Wonder, Z-Man Games, and Catan Studios. Asmodee also recently added Atomic Mass Games to their portfolio and they just published Marvel Crisis Protocol. Also Fantasy Flight is the publisher and designer of  Star Wars X-Wing, Armada, Legion. Losing Fantasy Flight, while not as detrimental to losing magic, is still a big blow as you lose all other Asmodee lines."

To be a good sub you need to be able to know where your breaking point is and be strong enough to assert your self if you're not getting what you want out of it. Its easy to flip into head space and ride the endorphins, but you need to be strong enough to maintain enough control to demand that respect.

I've been practicing BDSM as both a Dom and a sub for over 25 years.

I hate telling you this but I'm going to parrot Dan Savage here.

Any way, makes complete sense the pressure is probably his pushing on your prostate and it's an intense feeling, it can feel too much. even if it doesn't hurt. Eventually you will cum, may not be the orgasm you're used to but it will be an orgasm.

My advice is, you do what you're comfortable with. if you think you're able to ride it to the end do it, but you should stop when you want to. Sex is about listening to your and your partner's body. So if your body wants to stop just stop.
