While I understand you are only pretending to not understand why this man believes it isn't acceptable to buy Blizzard games, I'm going to walk you through it anyway, just because the best way to make a troll fuck off is still to disassemble his bullshit:

Why did you think this person thought it wasn't acceptable to buy Blizzard video games? You knew full well that he was talking about their behavior with regard to China. There is no way you thought his point was that they're all bad, and therefore you buy them because he's wrong and they are in fact good. You knew he was talking about China, you said you would buy them anyway because they are good, I correctly interpreted you're answer for what it really was: you would buy them because you want to (like any retail purchase; this being the extent of your bullshit answer is what made it clear you were worthless by the way), and you don't give a fuck about China."

While it was nice of you to stop refuting the true things I was saying after you first floundering attempt, moving on to a conversation about what you feel a motorist should be responsible for when we were having a conversation of the things OP said was very strange. But, regardless: 

>The cyclist is 100% at fault here because if you bike on the road without lights you can ruin your own life and someone else's because you're too fucking dense to either wear something to make yourself visible or bike somewhere safer. 

No, the driver is 100% at fault because there are bikes on the road without reflectors or lights (and many things that are not bikes, including people) and they chose to drive in a way that did not allow them to avoid an incident with these things. The driver is also the one with control of all of the kinetic energy. 

>Do you expect drivers to have to drive 20kph max everywhere at night just because some cyclist might be on the road without lights?

Not everywhere. On urban roads without enough viability to react and with no shoulder: Yes. Abso-fucking-lutely, yes. Are you fucking insane? There are lights on almost every road one would encounter these situations. If you can't see DRIVE FUCKING 20KPH OR GO TO FUCKING JAIL FOR THE MURDER YOU COMMITTED BY NOT DOING YOUR DUE DILIGENCE.

You keep bringing up these illegal moving violations that are not relevant here. This is a discussion of how bikes are entitled to be on the road despite OP not being able to see them. A cyclist riding down the road legally being hit by a car and killed was killed by the driver of the car. 

>>Why aren't vehicles taking precautions like driving at a speed that allows them to react to things? This is a failing of government more than anything.

>I mean, it goes the same for drivers as it does cyclists. You can't find a car that *doesn't* have headlights. Majority of modern cars even have automatic headlights. You also can't get arrested for hitting a deer, nor can you get sued by one. 

So you're saying you drive through the night entirely willing to hit a deer because you're secure in the knowledge that you aren't legally in the wrong? What an amazing argument for it to be entirely the drivers responsibility for hitting a cyclist. Apparently otherwise it just be an unfortunate situation. 

The driver is responsible for not hitting things with their car. If you don't feel that responsibility then you can fuck off, because you're as shitty and entitled of a human being as OP is. 

>It's an unfortunate circumstance. A cyclist would, I hope, be smart enough to ride safely and have the proper gear and attire. There's a reason the saying is ""deer in the headlights."" They're not exactly bright creatures. 

Hence why you're responsible for driving defensively. A cyclist in improper gear and attire is something you can reasonably expect to encounter, much like a deer. So do what you need to do to avoid hitting it. 

>>It absolutely does not. Once again: cyclists aren't in care and control of a massive object moving with the kinetic energy of a 25 handgun rounds.

>It does. If people are going to share the road with vehicles, they are just as responsible for their safety, and the safety of others, as the drivers right beside them.

No. They aren't. Don't drive if you think it's other people's responsibility to keep you safe. You need to be removed from the roads, Jesus christ. 

>Irresponsible cyclists can be just as dangerous. A vehicle may have to swerve or slam on their brakes to avoid a cyclist which can cause a wreck. 

Once again, this is a discussion of responsible cyclists. If a vehicle needs to swerve to avoid a cyclist riding on the road they are entitled to ride on after that cyclist did nothing wrong, the only cyclists we are discussing, then that driver is negligent for more than one reason. If a driver saw a cyclist raping someone in the street and hit that person with their car the cyclist also may be slightly in the wrong, but you know full well that isn't what we're talking about. 

Stop moving the goalposts because you want to feel more right. 

>Cyclists are entitled to the road just as drivers are, they are just as responsible for their safety as the drivers are. Any clothing is appropriate at the appropriate times. Cyclists should not be riding at night with no lights in black clothing. It seems cyclists are all too keen on passing 100% of the responsibility on drivers, which isn't right.

It is absolutely right. The roads don't belong you and your car as much as you want them to. If someone hits a cyclist wearing dark clothing because they felt entitled to not give  enough of a fuck to drive in a way that allows  them to react to road hazards, most of which won't have reflectors, then that driver deserves to rot in prison.

It isn't. In most places reflectors and lights on bikes is in fact the law, to the point where its harder to get a bike without them than it is to get a bike with them. This is the case in OPs state.

>If they are going to be sharing the road with a 2-ton metal death machine, why aren't they taking precautions to make it safer for everybody? 

They overwhelmingly are. The people who ride bikes without reflectors are usually the ones that do far more egregious shit like running lights and riding in the wrong direction, as well, and there aren't a huge number of them. It is illegal in the state OP lives in to ride without lights.

Likely a troll, just ignore them."
MurderedByWords,feinomh,t1_feigfpd,1579142788.0,No it doesn't. A cheap bag of coffee using a relatively standard amount is like $0.50. Maybe $0.25 if you like your coffee to taste like water but Starbucks decidedly does not.

These 4 or 5 people learned that the entire basis the entire online economy works on is broken, and they just sat on that information. It doesn't matter if someone can actually decrypt it it only matters that they know its decryptable. It was annoying to need to suspend disbelief to that degree."

Give anything a year or two and everyone will just stop giving a fuck. Hence why we have the shit gaming landscape we have now: first EA and 2K and Rockstar start fucking us over with their endless money-grubbing, anti-consumer bullshit, and gamers the world over thank them for it. Now Epic comes on the scene and there's one more cock for gamers to suck while they get short changed, all while once again flocking back to Blizzard as it supports a regime perpetrating a literal second Holocaust. I hate this fucking hobby. And the people who share it. You're all fucking worthless scum.
