YouShouldKnow,fekbtr9,t1_fekb2y3,1579196776.0,"Ahhhh this makes so much sense! Well that's really frustrating for American Amazon sellers, especially ones selling quality goods. 

I am starting to remember now about that podcast, there was a story about this American Amazon seller selling (I believe) handmade BBQ tools, and out of nowhere, he started seeing a Chinese seller selling the same exact things using his pictures but much, much cheaper. He went through a whole ordeal of trying to lower his price to match this Chinese seller's price and then complaining about this to Amazon about this because he was losing a lot of money at this point. And in the end, Amazon basically fucked him. Really sad.

Edit: Of course the Chinese seller's tools were of very poor quality, and not the same as this American seller's at all. So the buyers were complaining about the product, and this also negatively affected the American seller's business. All around terrible."

YouShouldKnow,fek4tnq,t1_fek4mf7,1579192625.0,Yeah the address part doesn't make sense at all. And they had my phone number too because it was on the shipping label. It was a bit unsettling but they haven't sent me anything since 2017 so...hmm
YouShouldKnow,fek438a,t1_fejl3e1,1579192181.0,"This happened to me!!! Over the course of 2-3 months, I got just the most random things: tv wall mount, iPhone case (I have a pixel), and keychain. I contacted Amazon and they were definitely useless. There were no orders on my account and no charges on my credit cards. I did a bunch of research and couldn't find anything.

Then months later I was listening to a podcast about Amazon sellers (can't remember which podcast it was), and one thing some Amazon sellers do is send their items to random recipients in the hopes that they'll leave then positive reviews... Still not sure how true that is but it's an explanation that kind of makes sense?"
