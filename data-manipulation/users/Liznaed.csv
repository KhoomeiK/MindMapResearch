I'd recommend for you to do some regular face studies at first, train yourself to break down different parts of the face into basic shapes, learn how it works etc before you can start making cartoon caricatures. When you learn the fundamentals well enough, you could start studying caricatures and cartoony styles you personally like to develop your style further.

artcritique,feoowr5,t3_eia6eh,1579303293.0,"I'd suggest making a very light general sketch before elaborating, this looks like you drew him on the fly, making him look a bit disproportionate and wonky.

artcritique,feoo0kv,t3_en8zz0,1579302796.0,"First thing I noticed is how you shade with black, this is a pretty big no-no if you want your artwork to look vibrant and add depth. If you're painting digitally, make sure to shift your color wheel ever so slightly to one side when picking a darker value of a color for your shadow. When cell shading, pick a dark color for the shadows instead of black, because the ambient light usually reflects off of shadows. If you look at snow, for example, if the sky is blue then the dark parts of the snow will look blue. Black shading only works in a colorless environment, your character should have dark red shadows since she's in a pink environment. Otherwise, you've got a great base; your proportions are mostly fine and from now on it's just a question about getting used to the digital art medium. Good luck!"
artcritique,feon3fs,t3_epe9f7,1579302495.0,"I recommend blocking out areas that might have hard shading first, as if you were cell shading, then filling those areas in with light cross hatching, then working from there. Try to either keep all the lines of your sketching in one direction or make the shadow transitions softer, right now the sketching looks quite chaotic. 

I'd also recommend looking into bounce light and terminators, as that can add a lot of depth to an object.

Otherwise, the shapes are quite well defined and you did a good job giving this object depth!"
