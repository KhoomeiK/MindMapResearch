According to...? From the NY Times article, which is the only reference I've been able to find to the 30km procession:

>General Suleimani’s [...] was received with military salutes at the airport in Ahvaz, a city in the southwest. A funeral procession then made its way through Ahvaz [...].

>A mass of people snaked across the city’s main streets and a long bridge over the Karoun River. Stretching over 30 kilometers, or almost 20 miles, the crowds of men and women in black carried flags and photos of Mr. Suleimani and beat their chests in unison as Islamic prayers blasted from speakers around the city.

Measuring the major roads in the city from the airport, across the bridge, to the other side of town maxes out at 11 miles. Someone is deliberately deceptive."
