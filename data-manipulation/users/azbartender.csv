Nurse,ffy30jq,t1_ffu92e8,1580337587.0,So I should make accommodations for a coworker who can't do their job because I chose to work in a female dominated profession?  Really?!?
Nurse,fft7zvd,t1_ffqgqbl,1580211584.0,"I never said that her superiors should suggest she find a new job, you went there because that's what you assumed I meant, typical.  Why should I find a different job because a co-worker CHOSE to get pregnant and can't do the job any more?"
Nurse,ffqazft,t1_ffpfy7a,1580128754.0,Any nurse that can't do the job they were hired to do should find a job that they are more suited for.
Nurse,ffpbou3,t1_ffpb7ue,1580091048.0,Not being able to take a chunk of the patient population means you can't the job the same way you could do it before.  And I absolutely agree that you have every right to protect yourself but not at the expense of your fellow employees.
Nurse,ffpb3fw,t3_euav6i,1580090633.0,You do kinda sound like you're whining/being dramatic about it.  If you're so worried about it find a nice safe clinic job until you give birth.  If you can't do the job you shouldn't be there.
