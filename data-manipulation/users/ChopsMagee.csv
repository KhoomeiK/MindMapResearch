I come from a normal environment, loving parents who were not rich or poor, the only violence was when my dad got the slipper out which happened once every few months.

But I do have aspergers and I was very hyperactive as a child and liked bashing my head against a wall (not hard, just so they touched) amongst other things.

I am now a 37 year old and I am nothing like I was then, and the parts that held me back with aspergers, like social things I have worked hard on.

Anyway without babbling on nobody knew I was an aspie because the medical side wasn't there to diagnose me....but my son just turned 5 and also has asperger's and I see him being very similar to how I was but I will fight tooth and nail to make sure he is not like me."
