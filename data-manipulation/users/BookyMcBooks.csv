If there's only 50 people online, and 25 of them are really good, and the rest are noobs, well, you're all going to get placed in the same match, because people don't want to wait forever for a match to start. The game isn't going to wait for 25 more equally skilled players to log on, it's just going to start a match.

If there are 100 players online, 50 are noobs and 50 are really good, then it should start a match that feels like people are more or less equally skilled.

SBMM is about distributing the skilled players and the noob players in the most optimal way. If there's 50 players online and they're vastly different in terms of skill, it isn't really the algorithm's fault, it's the lack of equally skilled players that you could be matched with.
