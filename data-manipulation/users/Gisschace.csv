I don’t think either of these are unreasonable. What I do think is unreasonable is if you’ve handed over your contact details just to express interest in something and then you get a daily email. Once a week or every few days is more than enough.

I dabbled in the past and can totally see that being the case. A few of them went upstairs while the others stayed downstairs at the party, and then they sat around chatting. I’ve been at many a party where you want to do a line but others at the party may not do it or you don’t know them that well or they might be anti drugs. So you sneak off in a little group under the pretence of having a chat elsewhere. Then you set it up somewhere quiet and give those in the know a little wink and a nudge to go in and help themselves.

I split up with my ex and honestly a month later I was ready to go.

The break was clean, straight forward, I can look back on the relationship with fondness but I don’t want to go back into it. There are no lingering emotional scars from it. We tried and it didn’t work, time for something new.

I’m generally a pragmatic person and I think that helps. I also know that neither of us did anything wrong so there’s nothing for me to process or get over. 

In fact I think having a 10 year relationship is a success and shows I have the emotional stability for a relationship. 

It was far harder to get over short situationships in my 20s than this.

Futurology,fe6zd9g,t1_fe6xnf6,1578908066.0,"Yeah I get that and my comment was a response to that. There aren't really any 'rivers' in Dubai, but there are old river beds/streams off the mountains. The issue Dubai has is exactly what you said, putting in the infrastructure needed and (most importantly because it doesn't happen right now) maintaining it. Most of these 'flash floods' can be prevented right now but they don't do things like properly clear the drains, which the rest of the year fills up with sand. One problem is a lot of the infrastructure is controlled by individual developers and planning regs are practically non existent (good luck finding a well maintained pavement). If you look into where the floods are it's usually in an area controlled by one of these developers, like a hotel. So there needs to be a government down directives to properly enforce proper drainage regs and then manage the maintenance.  

I lived there last year through the unusual rain we had, the vast vast majority of issues could have been prevented through education (they started campaigns to teach people how to drive in the rain) and maintenance. To give you an idea of what we're talking about, the rain was about 30 mins of semi hard rain, not a torrential downpour for hours. It would do that on and off for maybe a couple of hours and then be clear for the rest of the day. And you get that for maybe 5 days a year. It's something any other country could handle with no problems.

SkincareAddiction,fe3759h,t1_fe3561i,1578846575.0,"You sound like you need it! I got a huge one cause I have a large space but if you have a smaller room you can get cute little ones. Then there are options to add oils and things like that, but I’ve never bothered with those. 

I am lazy with cleaning it, I put the plastic bits in the dishwasher and then clean the element by soaking it in white vinegar (bought 5 litres of the stuff especially) and the lime scale comes off. Might be a better way of doing it. Mines lasted 5 years though so must be doing something right."
SkincareAddiction,fe2syt8,t1_fe2pnnv,1578842506.0,"Haha well they’re all sold in sq ft per room and who has that sort of information to hand when they’re flicking through the laminated book of dreams?? 

I do have another tip, some have night lights you can’t turn off so if you’re sensitive to light then make sure you don’t get one with those."
SkincareAddiction,fe2o6gs,t1_fe2n51c,1578841100.0,"I didn’t put much thought into it, I just got the biggest and cheapest on Argos. My house is unusual in that my bedroom is in a mezzanine over a large living room, so I need one which can do a large space. But they do really cute ones for smaller spaces.

Ooo I do have a tip, buy a massive bottle of white vinegar to descale it. Mine has lasted 5 years now with descaling every few months."
relationships,fe2mv2v,t1_fe28bzl,1578840655.0,"Yes this! No doubt he’s started to escalate the relationship and she’s feeling uncomfortable. She might not even be able to understand and articulate that so her way of reaching out was to ‘get in to trouble’ by telling you about the lie.

It just shows she’s still such a child and not as mature as people think. It could be a cry for help, not a thought through confession. 

There’s also an aspect of pride here where she doesn’t want to confess she was wrong, no doubt she argued she should be in this relationship in the first place. So doesn’t feel like she can ask directly for help. 

So her way of getting help is trying to get you to enforce the boundaries she doesn’t feel able to herself.

I think if they sat down and talked to her she might actually be relieved and appreciate the help to get out. Asking her the simple question ‘do you still want to be in this relationship?’ Will probably reveal a lot."
BravoRealHousewives,fe2kgy7,t1_fe2jg28,1578839501.0,"No I don’t think that’s difficult, if you read what the renovations were you’ll see they were things like rewiring, adding heating systems and fixing wooden beams and were planned before they agreed to move in:

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48746609

Secondly they’re now moving to Windsor because the cost of renovating a property there is 50% cheaper than renovating where they are now. That doesn’t sound difficult to me at all, in fact very prudent.

And aside, how do you know it’s her decision? How do you know the same renovations wouldn’t have happened if Harry was with anyone else?

Kate and Wills spent £4 million on renovating their Kensington Palace apartments - is that Kate being difficult??? If we’re going on the numbers then she must be 50% more difficult than Meghan.

And your second paragraph is striking, you’ve literally said she isn’t ‘towing the line’ which tells me that’s your problem with her. She doesn’t have to ‘toe the line’ for you or anyone else - that’s entitlement."

SkincareAddiction,fe2b7bb,t1_fe20yd1,1578836429.0,"Yeah I had a flat like that and it was gross, you could touch the walls and come away with damp hands. The landlord brought round a dehumidifier and it was on for two days solid and I had to empty the tray every two hours.

I think we’ve got better at keeping damp out of new builds but it means it’s flipped the other way. So if anyone is in a new build and has itchy skin get a humidifier!"
SkincareAddiction,fe2agtk,t1_fe21wpx,1578836288.0,Moving countries and needed it for work! I actually did a lot of googling about it beforehand and it’s quite common. If people are doing things like photo shoots abroad they take them. Obviously the pros have fancy flight cases but they cost over £100 so in my suitcase it went
SkincareAddiction,fe1yqi3,t1_fe1xvrb,1578832434.0,I’ve lived in two places in the UK where I’ve needed humidifiers. Both were new flats which had floor to ceiling windows and this time of year when the heating is on the air would get soooo dry. I was always itchy but didn’t realise what it was until I got a nest and the humidity was 25%!  So I run one in my flat overnight which keeps it up to around 45-50%.
datingoverthirty,fe1wqnf,t1_fe1u1ym,1578831801.0,"Yeah but I wouldn’t assume this comes from a bad place. If she was intending something then she wouldn’t tell you about him at all.

It’s probably either insecurity on her side, or she likes to hear you say no cause it validates your feelings for her, or something like that.

I don’t think she’s handled it well but it’s not something to be too concerned about. I would just say ‘of course I do!’ enthusiastically and see what her response is to that."
datingoverthirty,fe1rea7,t3_enmkj2,1578830028.0,"Did she ever go on a date with him? Seems strange she would want to chat to him when he was just an conversation went no where.

All I can think is she wants you to tell her not too, maybe she’s looking to clarify that you’re serious now?"
BravoRealHousewives,fe1l1ah,t1_fe1j3ao,1578827850.0,"And the subjective assessment is she is treated differently to other royals. The question is why is she getting this different treatment? And this has been her complaint. 

I’d love to see examples of her being difficult"
SkincareAddiction,fe1ivb9,t1_fe0xn4b,1578826996.0,"Yeah I’ve travelled a lot and never had a problem with any bottles breaking. When they’re in your suitcase with all your clothes they’re well cushioned.

I’ve even traveled with an IMac in my suitcase twice now with no problems so a little TO bottle will be fine."
datingoverthirty,fe1imw1,t1_fe182ec,1578826885.0,"That’s a good question, it doesn’t change the prep time it just means I have to incorporate it into my morning routine and then take make up with me to freshen up before the date. It’s not a lot but it is a bit of a drag remembering to pack it and then it takes up room in my already full bag.

It is less commitment overall as I am already out and less likely to have other commitments I would on the weekend. So I’d probably be more inclined to go.

Now you could probably say well you don’t have to do all of that. But then I am conventionally attractive and assume men match with me because of that. So I want to live up to those expectations.

Like I said if I am happy and excited to be meeting you then putting in that effort is no biggie because I want to impress you. Which is why sharing more messages is important."
AskUK,fe1hl4g,t1_fe1dyt2,1578826611.0,"That’s what I always think, life must be so exhausting hating everyone. Just chill and your life would be so much better. So much energy wasted on hating other people"

BravoRealHousewives,fe1en8s,t1_fe10g5k,1578825636.0,"No they aren’t cherry picking, they’re deliberately pointed out instances where she was treated differently. Such as criticising her for showing skin when Kate has done the same. The point being she is getting different treatment to other royals. The question is why. Coincidentally (or not) Michelle Obama also got criticised for showing ‘too much skin’.

Now I am not denying that if she was a white American or even a white common British woman she wouldn’t get the same treatment. She totally would, the press would only be happy with a compliant blue blooded woman who shuts up and toes the line. They tried it with Kate until she shut up and acted like the perfect princess, which is what she has had to do. They would find other ways to tear her down. Cause a confident woman who knows her own mind and isn’t afraid of sticking up for herself is the DMs worst nightmare.

What they’re doing with Meghan is aligning the criticism with known racist tropes, like she’s difficult (black women are accused of being difficult) or bringing up her relationship with her Dad (black fathers are stereotyped as dead beats).

These are the dog whistles, a dog whistle doesn’t mean it’s nothing. A dog whistle is something which appears to have one meaning to most people but actually has an meaning which sub groups pick up and run with. Other examples of dog whistles are Farage talking about hordes of immigrants making their way to the UK or Trumps ‘caravan’. Its codified language which just skirts the line and is a subtle way of triggering particular groups. In this case it creates page clicks for the daily mail. But it also triggers those trolls who send her abuse."

BravoRealHousewives,fe0z979,t1_fe0w4ww,1578820673.0,"I guess you didn’t go through the other two articles? They have linked examples of how she is treated differently to other royals, which is why I posted them despite being the guardian.

And you can not dismiss the presses role in encouraging trolls. If you see the hashtags used they’re directly tied back to press coverage of her being ‘difficult’.

Like I said, they can’t outwardly be sexiest and racist and whateverelsist towards her but they know a dog whistle when they hear one and know how to use it.

Everything else in your post is just opinion"
BravoRealHousewives,fe0tiuc,t1_fe0ery6,1578818498.0,"Look if you’re looking for a newspaper calling her a bl*ck b*tch you know you aren’t going to find it. They’re far to clever for that.

But here’s some reading which shows some of the treatment she gets and how it compares to other royals:
