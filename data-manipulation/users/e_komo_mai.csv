crochet,fdmajz0,t3_elzfxa,1578543976.0,Question as I know nothing about knitting. Can you not make them by knitting or is that a crochet thing?
AskReddit,fdm9v1r,t3_els9lh,1578543445.0,"If it's a 1 shot, and you have a clear story, just go with it and somehow add something to get them back to the story. 

If it's a long campaign, just do whatever. Make them rolls for checks. Let the dice to the talking. It's a RPG, so as long as they aren't complete jerks to you or other players, let them play their characters the way they created them."

sex,fcaxx3d,t1_fc8uure,1577578796.0,I can breathe through them if I'm alone and make a conscious effort to do so. But if it's me with a partner and it just comes on in the moment? Hell no. I'm too focused on what just happened to breathe. Haha.

The other rows dont have me do that but then if I dont, the criss-crosses dont match up. So I'm a little confused. I've worked this and pulled it out several times because it just doesnt look right. Please help."
