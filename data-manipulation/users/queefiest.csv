Personally if I ever feel like writing a will now even at 31 because if for whatever reason I become a vegetable or if I'm almost fully paralyzed but capable of communication, or something where I'm going to be miserable for the rest of my life (or unconscious) then I don't want doctor resources being wasted on me.

tifu,fcmnw78,t1_fcm8ai7,1577783509.0,At that age I'm just going to be honest about what it is. Currently my daughter is 5 and she has found it and thought it was her phone and thankfully it's child proofed to turn it on. This happened a year ago I think and because of her age I just acted like it was no big deal and hid it much better. I figure if I make a big deal it will spark her curiosity. When she's 10 if she ends up finding it I'll just explain what it is and she can be grossed out about it for a bit. I'd rather she was grossed out than make sex uncomfortable. My mom explained sex to me but she made it very clinical. I always felt ashamed of my sexuality for the longest time too because she would make fun of me whenever I had a crush on a boy. Plus I wasn't allowed to date boys. It made sex really weird and I think it's why I was so promiscuous when I finally was able to have sex. I think if I just act like sex is a normal thing and she gets grossed out that it's a healthier reaction than what I was given.
