politics,ff9jgx7,t1_ff9ayzh,1579714315.0,"Because it helps them marginalize a group who's gained strength and momentum over the past decades, while also giving them more credibility to prove they're TOTALLY NOT a bunch of self-hating closeted satanist homosexuals. Not that I believe that last part, but considering the amount of projection we've seen from the US right, that's probably what they are."
depression,ff0v6al,t3_er2c9d,1579472590.0,"I turned 31 a few weeks ago and I know exactly how you're feeling. Here I am, single, working a job somewhat related to what I wanted to do but with terrible pay and no job security, living cheque to cheque. I ""followed my dreams"" for the past 5-6 years and I feel neither accomplished nor valued. Everybody around me is earning decent salaries, establishing themselves as ""real"" adults with good careers while I'm just kind of existing and going through the motions with nothing but semi-successful moral achievements.

These past holidays have been the hardest of my life. I was alone for most of them, and realized that all my friends have been slipping away from me, through their careers, relationships or just moving away. Whereas I've just been kind of a passenger in my own life and have nothing to show for it. I'd never felt so alone on so many levels before.

Realizing this pushed me to ask myself hard questions, and I decided to move to a different continent before the end of the year. I have nothing holding me where I currently am and I feel the need to step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself for once. This doesn't make me feel any less dissatisfied with how my life went up to now but it gives me hope that I can do whatever I want to not feel the same way in 5-10 years.

All this to say, you're not alone. And more importantly, it's not too late to switch things up. There's no guarantee of success or happiness, but we owe it to ourselves to seek change and give ourselves a shot at better/more fulfilling lives. Keep your head up! :)"

depression,fdlv0aq,t1_fdlu905,1578533136.0,"That's good! It all starts from small actions like that. Even if you feel like therapy is not working, there's so many different approaches, psychological outlooks, etc. A friend had to go through 3-4 different therapists before they found one that could get them to change their outlook, it's a process. 

There's nothing wrong with signing up on a dating website that isn't hookup-oriented (OKC, POF, etc) and just talking to women. Even the ones you may not find attractive, because they probably know exactly how you feel. Every decent convo is a confidence booster that will help. But eyes on the prize dude, and that's you. You need to have a positive relationship with yourself before anything else comes. So expect nothing. Maybe talk with your therapist about the best ways to put yourself out there without risking being so hurt again? There's ways. You got this."
depression,fdltcdt,t1_fdls5ik,1578532015.0,"I've been there. There's no easy way to go at it, you just have to fight the negative thoughts every day. Don't trust your mind, it's been conditioned to make you think you cannot be/do better. It's overwhelming but it's the only way. Therapy and medication can help sometimes but you have to want to make changes first. And if you do, you'll be so thankful for allowing yourself to have a shot at a better life. 

I'm right there with you about the couples thing. I had a depressive episode that was caused by that during the holidays. But the truth is, it's tunnel vision. There's single people everywhere, we just don't notice them because they don't remind us that we're alone. The same way there's lots of smallish, overweight dudes in happy relationships :). There's so much hope for you, you just have to give it a real go. Seek help if you need, talk to people around you. It's ok not to have it all figured out. You just have to give yourself a real shot. :)"
depression,fdlrpx2,t1_fdlqrry,1578530912.0,"Dude, fuck statistics. Do you know how many people lie when participating in polls and stuff like that? Especially when it comes to being a virgin? Also, 10% of hundreds of millions is... tens of millions. You're nowhere near alone even if the stats are accurate. Which I doubt.

I get that it feels impossible to love yourself. It might feel like that for a while still. But set the rest of these things in motion, and it might become plausible at some point, you just cannot imagine it right now. There's no magic recipe. I worked on myself for 10 years before I could confidently say I somewhat loved myself. But the baby steps along the way will help a lot.

I'm not in a position to offer advice on the imaginary girlfriends but you probably know it's not healthy. But maybe you can use them as inspiration for your writing? Having a deep imagination is a gift, you just have to use it for the right reasons."
depression,fdlppfp,t3_elvipt,1578529537.0,"Cheer up friend, you're not the only one to feel that way and the good news is, there's so much you can do to feel better. 

You're so young still, and your potential is only limited by your desire to be the best version of yourself. The harsh truth is, you need to love yourself before someone else can love you, as people have told you. The same way you probably wouldn't settle for just ANY girl, women do the same, and desperate relationships between desperate people do not work out. You may ending up finding a girlfriend without loving yourself, but I can guarantee it won't solve the rest of your problems and will probably mess with your relationship, so the crucial thing is to focus on YOU. I used to be like you 12-13 years ago. I hated the way I looked, I always felt awkward around women (still kinda do sometimes), didn't go out much and thought I'd be alone forever (granted I'm (M31) single atm, but that's another topic). It all worked out (kinda) because I gave myself a shot to be who I wanted to be.

In terms of jobs, you need to start with the lowest possible standards because you have no experience. Print CVs by the dozen and drop them off at any place around you. If that doesn't work, any fast food place will have you. It's gonna suck, but you'll have some money, will be able to afford investing in your hobbies, in going out, and in yourself, mostly and may even make some friends. You know, girls work there too ;). You do that for a few months and then you can move up to trying to get a nicer job, but we all gotta start at the bottom. Having money in your pockets will make you feel more independent, more like a grown up and less like a kid. You'll be able to go places, do things and that all goes towards your personal growth as a human being, and (unfortunately, because fuck capitalism), will make you more attractive to potential dates. 

Being confident is hard when you're used to rejection. I've been there, and am still working on it a decade later. But the most crucial thing to fight this is remembering the good in you. You've noted all your flaws in your post but I'd like to see you list what you think your strengths and qualities are. Start from there. Make lists of things you want to accomplish. Set things in motion and find ways to work on your goals a little bit everyday. Accept that some days, you won't be good enough, and that it's ok. You clearly have the desire to work on yourself and improve. You just need to figure out why you want to, and how you can do it. Getting a gf should not be the end-all, be-all, it's just another step in life. 

Also, real life is not American Pie. The day you find a woman that loves you, she will be thankful to guide you towards having a sexual life. She won't be embarrassed, she'll be happy that you haven't been fucked up over by  women who turned you into a fuckboy or whatever term people use these days. The only thing is, when that opportunity comes, be honest, don't hide it. Losing your virginity to a hooker will probably fuck you up your perception of sex for life, please don't do it. 

Otherwise, don't starve yourself. This is the worst way to lose weight and will fuck with your mood and the way you go through your day. Fruits and veggies are your best friends. Fat and sugar aren't. I hate going to the gym to I started biking everywhere and lost 40+ pounds in a year. You can do it too.

Finally, be yourself. So you love tv shows, video games and writing. That's great! That's three super popular subjects you can talk about with other people and create bonds with over. Maybe your town has a writing club, or creative writing classes. Take one of those. Work on the things you love, don't try to ""find"" other hobbies for the sake of being more interesting to people. 

Chin up dude, you're just getting started in life and have every chance to be the person you want to be. You just have to give yourself the chance to become that person, love yourself just enough to find the necessary drive to make the first steps. The rest will follow. :)"
depression,fd5b5sm,t3_ek08l0,1578175926.0,"It helps to remember that other people are used to seeing us the way we are, whereas we only see ourselves through the mirror and pics/videos. That's why people rarely agree when I say I find myself ugly on any given picture, because they're used to seeing me from every angle and I'm not. 

Ugly is very relative, and we're the worst judges of that when it comes to ourselves. Learn to accept and love the way you are, because most people probably don't think you're nearly as ugly as you may believe you are."
torontoraptors,fd45vic,t3_ejzhka,1578164675.0,"MIA scored one more point last night against ORL than they did against us, and lost. The difference was, ORL didn't have a record-breaking bad shooting night, so they won. No matter how good your defence is, you won't win many games if you score 80ish points per game."
depression,fcojppe,t3_ei19sk,1577833944.0,"Most likely spending it alone for the second year in a row. Most of my friends are going to this event where other friends are DJing, but I didn't buy a ticket and am too broke to get drunk there anyway. I'm single, haven't been invited to any house parties and no friend reached out to do something, so I guess it's gonna be video games, weed and beer for me tonight. 

My mom's over in France and it just turned midnight there, so I'm waiting for her call before turning off my phone and trying not to care about being alone. Still stings tho."
depression,fcoie80,t3_ehzrkw,1577832971.0,"This post really hit home, OP. On Dec. 25th, I made a bet with myself to stay off social media between Christmas and 2020. I had a few relapses where I checked some tweets and a few IG stories (and made sure I didn't skip on urgent messages) but for the most part I stuck to it, with Reddit being the sole exception. 

A week later, I feel a sense of clarity in my thoughts that I haven't had in a while. I realized that being constantly exposed to people's lives through social media really makes you care too much about what others do and think, and life through the social media eye really becomes a big whole performative act in which everyone overshares in order to seem normal/happy. Through this week, I've had the chance to take a long hard look at my life and confront myself on why I've been deeply unhappy this year despite things looking up at the start of 2019. 

Turns out I'm happier when I don't spend hours every day looking at what people post on social media. Thoughts are clearer, my goals and outlook on life aren't tainted by social pressure and for the first time in a long time, I feel somewhat in control again. We'll see how long that lasts but it's a nice change. Hopefully you experience similar results."
