depression,ff8wnbz,t1_ff8f9lk,1579698528.0,"Thanks, I appreciate it. Best of luck to you as well."
depression,ff8wm2u,t1_ff8uf6u,1579698497.0,I live in their house by myself. With my finances where they are at the moment it's not feasible. Plus my dad is highly allergic to dogs and cats so it's a no go.
depression,ff7ypt3,t1_ff7xkrx,1579661541.0,"Thanks. It took a long time for me to realize that I'm not some monster or a failure like I used to believe. It also took me a long time to realize just how strong I am. Depression is kind of like trying to walk upstream. The footing is unsteady and no matter where I step the water just keeps coming, hammering away at me. But I'm still here, sopping wet, fighting my way forward."
depression,ff7jkzf,t1_ff7itja,1579651071.0,"I don't unfortunately. I currently live at my parents house as well so it's not really an option either. I do, however, go visit a friend occasionally that has a dog and two cats. They always flock to me whenever I'm there. It's kinda nice."
depression,ff7j5ln,t1_ff71l45,1579650782.0,I talk with friends sometimes. Or try to. Some of them understand better than others. But talking face-to-face is a whole other beast.
depression,ff7igb0,t1_ff6apjb,1579650304.0,"I feel like I put on a mask years ago that virtually never comes off. There's times where it does, hours or days or maybe even a week. But it always goes back on."
depression,ff7i10u,t1_ff6azk1,1579650021.0,"My parents know from a few years ago, but it's never really talked about. For My dad and step-mom's part, though, they know if I don't initiate a conversation I just won't talk about it. My friends, on the other hand, I don't know. We've had a few talks about what depression is like or that I have it, but it usually doesn't go much farther."
depression,ff5imtk,t1_ff5ih2m,1579594599.0,"I reached out to a friend over the weekend and told him I was feeling detached. He came and picked me up so we could just hang out. It felt good for awhile, but after he went to bed I cried myself to sleep on his couch. I don't like people a whole lot. With basically being stuck in my house the last 3 weeks due to an injury, though, I'm feeling especially bad. I just want someone to hug me."
depression,feu6lyi,t3_eqcju4,1579383622.0,"I finally had a conversation with a friend about depression the other night while we were playing video games. Between me having depression and him suffering from severe anxiety I was able to just have an honest conversation about how shit gets to me and how I feel empty all the time. And it was the first time I've had one of those conversations with someone without being told how to fix things and get out of my ""rut.""

I get people wanting, or at least trying, to help. Sometimes, though, all I want, all I need, is someone to listen to me. I'm a fucking human being, not a side project."
depression,febbhh4,t1_feb806e,1578957142.0,"My dreams always wind up being about things I've lost or things I want/wanted. They're never extravagant. I'll sit with someone on the couch, go for a walk, maybe have a cup of coffee. But they feel real. So when I wake up there's just a hole."
depression,fe9yctm,t3_eo4b8x,1578942571.0,"My dreams have been particularly intense lately, though it's left me feeling hollow. I wake up and can't shake the feeling that I've lost something, that another door has been closed on me."
depression,fdi5cqn,t3_elhxst,1578436014.0,"That's awesome. I dread doing household tasks even though I know I'll feel a little bit better afterwards. Finally talked myself into doing a sink full of dishes the other day, and it was like a weight being lifted. The small things sometimes have such a big impact."
depression,fdi3yo1,t3_elhhgz,1578435312.0,"I feel like this a lot. Generally speaking, people irritate me. I don't like crowded areas, I don't particularly care for meeting lots of new people, and I'm rather particular about who I spend my time with. Still, when I'm alone too much I feel so detached from everyone and everything. Definitely relate to the feeling of wanting someone to be close with. I fucking miss just having someone I can sit next to and watch TV with and other small stuff like that."
depression,fdfkzq0,t3_ekw3j2,1578364141.0,"When my last relationship ended my ex told me she couldn't handle me when I went all ""depression mode"" and waved her hand for effect. Then had the audacity to say she hoped we could still be friends. All I could say was okay. Then I packed up my shit and left, swearing I'd never talk to her again. And I've kept that promise.

I understand that I can be a lot to handle at times, and I know it's hard to see someone you care about suffer but feel unable to help. The way I look at it, though, is that if someone really cares about me they won't just bail when the chips are down. I'm open with people I want to date about my struggles with depression and being a recovered addict. They can either accept that or they can't."
depression,fdfjitk,t3_ekuia8,1578363176.0,"Sometimes I feel like I'm Atlas, being crushed beneath the weight of the world yet somehow still holding on, refusing to give up. But then I shift the weight, take a deep breath, and stand tall, the burden of the past, of all I've lost, of all the mistakes I've made inconsequential in comparison to my spirit.

When that happens the real me takes center stage. And what a glorious performance he gives. A sly grin oft tugging at his lips he moves ever forward, mind clear, eyes full of life, no moment too small to enjoy, no problem too big to overcome. Like Atlas, though, I seem to be unable to ever truly be free of my burdens and so the curtain closes, the mask once more at the fore."
depression,fdfc235,t3_el170m,1578358155.0,"All the time. I catch a lot of flak from some of my friends because I've been single for so long. They always tell me I just need to go for it and message people, then get real quiet when I point out how all of our conversations start. And I get it, people have lives. At the moment, I don't. All the same, I constantly question why I waste my time trying to talk to people who never bother to message me first."

depression,fd6b8oq,t3_ek5kik,1578188327.0,"Don't have a family but i can relate to the money trouble. Left a job I'd been at for two and a half years in Nov. Was unemployed for a month and money started drying up fast thanks to the holidays and bills. Got hired at a job I felt good about only to discover almost immediately that I absolutely hate it and that it would, at best, delay me going completely and utterly broke. Then two days ago I fractured my foot. The past two days have just been a mess of emotions, that big ""what now"" question hanging over me."
depression,fd6af9b,t3_ek5msi,1578187978.0,"That's what drove me to work in healthcare. I knew I couldn't help myself, but I thought that if I could only help other people maybe I wouldn't feel so hollow. For awhile it worked. I even came to believe that I really wanted to be a nurse. But everything's come full circle, and now I have no fucking idea what I'm doing."
depression,fd5o6q3,t3_ejxm7l,1578179589.0,"Congrats, keep up the good work. Some days working out makes me feel significantly better. Some it feels more like maintenance than anything else. Still, it helps to know that I'm working on things."
depression,fd5manw,t3_ejx4cu,1578179012.0,"I absolutely can't stand this line of thinking. Just because the rest of the world can't see our struggles doesn't mean they're not real. Equally as important is the reality that depression doesn't solely feed off of bad shit happening. Some of my worst days have come when nothing particularly bad happens. Hell, I've cried myself to sleep after having a pretty good day plenty of times."
depression,fcvkszu,t1_fcugex5,1578004229.0,I went to visit a friend the other day and his dog was glued to me the moment I sat down. The love pets give us is just so absolute. They don't care how we look at ourselves. They don't care how we've struggled. They just love us for existing. Pets really are amazing.

depression,fcokbj8,t1_fcok1fc,1577834388.0,"Ah shit, my bad. Do you know if you have any common interests with them outside of school? Much as I love my couple friends I have found that fairly often I have to initiate when it comes to hanging out. It's frustrating, sure, but honestly I'm the only one that doesn't really have much of a life."
depression,fcojsn6,t1_fcojkbj,1577834004.0,School friends can wind up being your closest friends. If I wasn't still friends with 2 people from high School and 1 from college I don't really know if I'd have any friends to be honest.
depression,fco7x4h,t3_ei7mgi,1577825788.0,"My goal for 2020 is to say good-fucking-bye to the people that weren't there for me or who can't accept me for who I am. You disappear when I need someone to talk to and am feeling low? Fuck you. Don't like that I'm not always rainbows and butterflies? Fuck you. Can't stand that I'm reserved and take a bit to actually open up? Fuck you. We've gotten to know each other and you don't think you really like what you see? Great, here's a fuck you for your trouble.

I'm done with those people. You either want me in your life or you don't. I'm me. I'm weird and quiet and loud and sensitive and a lot to handle at times. But I'm the kind of person that would give the shirt off my back just to see someone I care about smile. And I'm sure as fuck done apologizing for it."
depression,fco37nf,t3_ei5k49,1577823222.0,Thank you. I hope you have a good new years.
depression,fcnrx42,t3_ei5j8p,1577817271.0,Things like this always mean so much. It feels great when someone just makes you feel like a human. I'm glad you had such a positive experience.
depression,fcmahd7,t3_ehrota,1577768706.0,"I saw your edit, and I'm glad you're doing a bit better. I used to work with people with developmental disabilities. One morning while I was showering someone I noticed he was unusually quiet so I asked what was wrong. He was upset because he had seen on the news that someone had committed suicide. We ended up having a pretty long talk about depression. And after our talk he told me he just wished that he could help people who were feeling sad. That morning as I drove home I bawled my eyes out.

I've sat on the floor, staring at a bottle of painkillers or with a knife at my throat, wanting nothing more than everything to end, to finally be at peace. I've drank till I puked blood and then kept drinking, hoping that my body would just shut down and I'd never wake up. But I could never bring myself to go through with it.

I thought about all of that while we were talking. It completely blew my mind how someone with their own struggles could have such compassion for a complete stranger. But there he was, crying, wishing more than anything that he could have helped. It made me realize that no matter how alone I felt there was someone out there that cared."
depression,fcm8e6r,t1_fcm7o6n,1577766974.0,One of the few things I take comfort in is that I've managed to make it this far without a whole lot of help. When I got clean from painkillers I did it all on my own in spite of certain family members pressuring me to keep using. It's those things I look to and focus on when I'm feeling alone.
depression,fcm7hvf,t3_ehotyn,1577766256.0,The number of times people have told me if I ever need anything or I ever need to talk and then disappeared royally pisses me off. I try so hard to be there for people when they need me. But when I need someone I'm lucky to get a single message.
depression,fcha5le,t1_fch54n3,1577648658.0,"Thanks. I'm in a much better place now than I was last year, or even most of this year, to actually try dating. Depression, anxiety, and my past with addiction make things weird though. There's a lot of people that understand everyone has had their struggles. But there's also a lot of people who can't understand just how hard it is dealing with that stuff. I'm straightforward about these days because hiding it doesn't change what has happened or what I still go through. And frankly if someone can't deal with that, fuck em."
depression,fcgkwj7,t1_fcaa2k2,1577641262.0,"Yeah it just sucks. I have such a hard time communicating and opening up to people that when I do start to get close to someone everything feels amplified. More than anything, though, it's being ghosted that feels the worst."
depression,fcapxgt,t1_fcabjqp,1577574240.0,That sounds like a good plan for the day. It's easy to get overwhelmed when so many big things are happening. But sometimes dialing it back and focusing on the things right in front of you can help you catch your breath and sort your thoughts out.
depression,fc9r7vr,t3_egrutg,1577556994.0,I used to call off at Wal-Mart claiming that I had a migraine when I was just depressed. Currently training at a job I started recently and trying to convince myself to go into work has been a nightmare.
depression,fc9q260,t3_egr1c1,1577556474.0,"Last year I got really close to someone for the first time in years. I tried to convince myself for months that I should just go for it and ask her out. We had such great chemistry. When we were together we laughed and joked and had an absolute blast. We even shared some life experience so it was so easy to talk about stuff. But when I finally worked up the courage to ask her out she just up and disappeared.

Fast forward 18 months, someone else comes along. Someone that I get along with amazingly well, that makes me laugh and smile, that I can talk to about everything (including addiction, anxiety, and depression). The difference is that this time I actually had a shot. We spent some time together, held hands, cuddled, kissed. It was amazing and felt like the start of something really great. But then a week ago the messages just stopped.

I don't know. I know these things happen sometimes and that in instances like this we pretty much never wind up getting answers. Still, it fucking hurts to wait so long for someone to come along that makes you feel like this only for them to disappear. Just wish I could catch a break after everything I've been through and overcome."
depression,fc9mq51,t3_egoxgv,1577555000.0,"At my lowest point I forced myself to stop looking for big moments or experiences and started focusing on the little things. Sometimes it was something as simple as sitting quietly for a few minutes enjoying a cup of coffee. Others it was taking a shower and brushing my teeth so that I could just feel clean. Over the years I've found that finding something positive, no matter how small, can have a big impact."
depression,fc9luzw,t3_egrb98,1577554614.0,"I make a lot of jokes about not having had sex for a long time, but honestly it's whatever. Being starved for intimacy, though, fuck that hurts. I got to experience some intimacy for the first time in years the past two weeks, and it was intoxicating. The feeling of just melting into someone and having everything else just fade away is unlike anything. Sadly it didn't work out. But having a chance to feel something like that, however short lived and painful it was/is, is something I wouldn't trade."
depression,fc9ilol,t3_egqe95,1577553206.0,"I've dealt with depression for so long that I honestly don't know what I was beforehand. My entire family are extroverts, but I'm so far from the tree that I can't help but wonder what happened. There's times where I'm so easy going and good with people. And others I start getting agitated and anxious if I'm around a group of people for more than an hr or two."
depression,fc256m4,t1_fc248u3,1577340907.0,"A couple of my friends know my whole story, but I only really talk to one of them when I'm having a breakdown. With someone I'm interested in having a relationship with? That I struggle with. My last girlfriend broke up with me because ""I can't handle you when you're all depression mode."" Four and a half years later that still hurts because how can someone treat you like you're just broken and then turn around and dump some shit like that on you? People are fucked."
