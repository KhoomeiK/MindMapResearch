AmItheAsshole,ffrmhp5,t3_eurjt5,1580161103.0,"NTA but OP, make sure you tell hospital staff WELL beforehand that you don't want them in the room for the birth. Nurses are well equipped to dealing with this sort of thing and chances are you'll be able to speak with someone when you arrive to deliver the baby, but just in case FIL and hubby talk over you so you can't get a word in, or if you are in late stages of labor and unable to communicate well, PLEASE inform L&D ahead of time of your wishes"

MedicalGore,ff9sdam,t1_ff84iup,1579720176.0,I took an angle grinder to the nose and only later realized how close I was to losing an eye. When it hit my nose it whipped around and abraded a section right underneath my eye. I never go without my face shield anymore.

AmItheAsshole,felfg3v,t1_fel9x5y,1579220914.0,"I disagree about talking about pay being taboo. It's only taboo because employers make it seem that way. Many women have been paid less than their male counterparts for years without even knowing it, and only found out because someone decided to talk about it at some point. Pay should be an open topic and people shouldn't feel ashamed to talk about it."

todayilearned,fdwlvjd,t1_fdwjfzh,1578760024.0,"The only reason I can come up with why having your baby carted to you at work is because we (women) still have to struggle with getting work done and taking care of baby. We would still likely be passed over for promotions, pay increases, and still be viewed as sub par to our male counterparts that didn't have to have their babies at work.

Also, the crying would be awful to deal with in an office environment, especially if there was a lot of phone use.

It's great to explore ideas, though. Because clearly, something needs to be done."

homestead,fdkh3am,t1_fdk4o11,1578503739.0,I am also curious about a basic startup cost. I have about 5 acres and am planning a large garden so naturally I'd like a couple hives (and a million other things down the road of course) but not sure what I'm looking at cost wise.
homestead,fdeg252,t1_fde63jc,1578338245.0,Thanks! In the spring I'll be putting in fencing for any goats I eventually end up with. I have just under 5 acres so I'm hoping that will be enough to keep them happy enough to want to stay inside the fence haha

MedicalGore,fdcreuc,t1_fdcqc59,1578282189.0,"I'd assume a meat grinder would be on a counter. Babies that young don't just find their way onto counters without some help. So let's assume the baby got onto the counter herself. So then you have to assume the parents or an adult isn't watching her, because she managed to get her entire fucking arm stuck in there. On top of that, the machine had to be running for it to do that kind of damage. So that means that either parents or supervisory adult isn't in the room for an extended period of time with a meat grinder running, or they didn't give a fuck.  Either way, parents/adult in charge are to fully blame for this."
MedicalGore,fdcr3vs,t1_fdcngmy,1578281961.0,I think it depends on the location. I sliced my thumb open and watched a tendon shoot up into my thumb and disappear forever. I sewed myself up and recovered with full range of motion. I know that isn't always the case though.
