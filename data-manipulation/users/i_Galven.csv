you imbecile, i use the stuff occasionally, i'm just not an addict the way you are, the fuck are you talking about?

reactions are different, the bodily effects are not.

well in that case thank heavens we were blessed with such an enlightened person as yourself to lead us out of the darkness. You are not at all a delusional hedonistic narcissist who can't restrain him/herself enough to pass a fucking drug test."

>states like Maine and Nevada are setting the trends for the future with new legislation that prevents discrimination for drug use.

oh, you mean states where it's legalized? Gee, i wonder why. Second, if there wasn't any difference, why would the employers ever screen? what difference does it make for them if you're high or not? third, your boss can come up with an excuse and fire you on the spot whenever he/she wants, those legislations protect only against the most blatant abuses."

hmm, for some reason, i don't believe you, considering that it's a well known fact that drug users have a poor perception of their functionality under the influence.

>I smoke marijuana very heavily and I'm not going to stop.

This sorta statement doesn't come from a high-functioning individual.

not that it matters what i think. The simple reality is you can't get both of the things you want. So you either curb the usage to reasonable levels or you get stuck in a low paying job where you're always at the risk of losing said job."
