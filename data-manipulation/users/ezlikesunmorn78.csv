AskReddit,femf6kn,t1_femecmn,1579252316.0,"It's very difficult. I have physical and psychological disabilities that have affected me the majority of my life. I know some of my health issues were due to a predisposition as well as environmental factors. Btw, I am 41 now. I am facing the home stretch, but I am so torn. Trying to find resources online or forums is extremely difficult due to the fact most are for women who can not have their own children or those that do not want children. I am assuming I can (though I haven't tried to find out) and I do want. Besides the painful physical conditions, I think the biggest fear is passing on the mental health disorders. It wouldn't be fair to knowingly give someone else the hell I live with daily. I know that with my spine and hips, even carrying a baby would result in months of bedrest. I do not have a partner or much of a support system and I'm on disability, so I'm poor. I try to remind myself that my decision is 99% the best for a child and 1% my own selfish wants. What is best for another person's life (IMO) shouldn't include suffering if it's in my control. I think my biological clock started screaming at me in my early 30's. Part of me wants to listen so bad and try before my time runs out. It's a war of the mind against the mind. 

Just take it day by day and don't rush any decisions. You have a lot of living to do one your own :) In ten years, see where life has taken you. I know when I was 20, life was MUCH different than 30 or even 40. Part of me still thinks I'm in my 20's and have all the time in the world to decide. I still have the mentality that I'm not ready, but when is ""ready""? I think I'm trying to constantly trick my own brain. It's funny how life throws curveballs. Seriously, just enjoy each other's company and go do the things you want and can still do. 

Society thinks women should have children. Women are getting pregnant much later in life now in order to fulfill their own dreams. I feel guilt knowing I haven't produced any grandchildren for my parents, but then I remember they aren't the ones who will struggle every day. Meanwhile, I'm watching ""cute babies say their first word"" on YouTube against my better judgement lol. I know I'd be an awesome mom, but those pesky genes have me so worried. I know they can test for a lot now in utero, but by then it's kinda too late. I'll stick with my pets I suppose lol. Stay strong!"
AskReddit,femcyzy,t1_femcvjv,1579249188.0,Your biological clock will typically pester you and urge you to reproduce. It gets stronger as you get older. It's like a nagging drive you have no control over (can't turn it off).
AskReddit,fei6gre,t3_ep1mtj,1579131340.0,"Put all of my animals outside so they can be found/not eat me, pick a neighbor and then throw all of my sex & kinky $hit in the neighbor's yard, and then try to off myself. I want to go out on my terms."
AskReddit,fef0sf7,t3_eondj6,1579045498.0,My ex does this every day. More on the weekends. Strategy is alcoholism.
dogs,fecjndj,t1_fecekko,1578975530.0,"Tater! I love it! If he’s anything like my Dakota was, keep a short leash around squirrels lol. He still snagged a few out back. He was also trained very well, but he still had the IDGAF attitude and would sometimes break out for a stroll for a couple hours. I think he thought he just rented a room from me or something lol! I found borador on a hybrid dog breed site. You’d be surprised what people have come up with for mutts hahaha! Tater might want a friend to play with down the road too! maybe find some toys he can chase in the yard the fills the herding part of him? Dakota was obsessed with the laser pen! He knew it wasn’t real but wow he’d go nuts! Night time with the laser pen outside was fun too! I wish you nothing but joy with him! And thank you for your condolences. They never live long enough...."
dogs,fecbdn4,t3_eo5tdp,1578970094.0,"Omfg! Someone should lend them one for a trail run for one week! Better yet, two of them. Should solve that. Pets are not presents (unless to yourself). If money is a factor, compile a list of prices and medical bills for what she wants. Might deter her. I f-ing hate people with her mindset. 

Poor dog being outside on a chain reminds me of all those Hurricane Katrina photos where the chains looped trees and power lines and hung the sweet babies. Then there are the predators out there that they can’t run from, weather conditions, loneliness, a sad life for many.  It’s not a yard accessory! Can’t protect you inside. Fleas. Ticks. Muscle atrophy. Barking for attention bugging neighbors. Kids teasing it. I could go on. At least get a run or zip line. Grrrr!!!"
dogs,feap2vq,t3_eo3sk2,1578950967.0,"Ohio here. The county shelters tend to be on a sliding scale of age. Youngest are up to $350 and oldest are usually a bit above $100. If they have been there a long time, they will be cheaper as well. On holidays, they have specials for about 98% of the dogs being $19! Most are pitties and they are trying to clear out for space. All come with shots, spay/neuter, microchip, etc.  Rural shelters tend to be less expensive.

Breed specific rescues are very high. $600-$1500. Because - well, they can. Many shelters will send purebred dogs to these rescues, which I have conflicting feelings about. However, if it helps county shelters with funding, I can see why they do it. 

$200ish for a rescue dog is a bargain if it includes the shots, spay/neuter, chip, etc. That is what you'd pay at a clinic for these services or more. 

A rescue dog will generally pay you back in undying love for saving them. They know ;) Some need more time/love/training to warm up and trust again, but it's worth it!"
dogs,feale62,t1_fe83rkv,1578950063.0,Awww I just put my borador to sleep last week. He lived to be 15. Incredibly smart (border collie) and loyal (lab). Amazing dog! I never heard anyone else call the breed by the hybrid name until you. I hope you have a long and happy life together!
AskReddit,fe5jklb,t3_ennslu,1578870246.0,"Don't forget sunscreen! Wear a facial moisturizer with a minimum 15 spf daily (or more if prolonged outside exposure) and use a minimum 30 spf  and includes UVA/UVB protection when spending time outdoors. I buy the spray kind so I can reach all parts of me. Reapply every 80 minutes. Your skin and health will thank you for it down the road. You CAN still get tan while wearing sunscreen, so don't let that deter you.

Don't spend beyond your means. It's  fine to treat yourself now and then, but going out with friends or to eat all of the time will bite you in the long run. Stay away from credit cards unless you are trying to build your credit. Research how to safely use a card to do this.

Youtube and Google are your oysters. If you need knowledge, need a tutorial for fixing something, money saving hacks, it's all there. Don't be afraid to try something out of your comfort zone.

There are MANY resources for help online. Be it in FB or Reddit forums, county/city/state sites, use what you have available to do the research if you need necessities, appliances, help moving, it's all out there and there are people and organizations willing to help if necessary.

You will likely grow apart from old friends as you venture out in the world and make new ones. Check in once in a while, but just know that they are also changing and in ten years, you likely won't be the same person each other knew and that is okay.

Edited to add something VERY important:

We all hate reading contracts, but when it comes to a lease, work, car, I can not stress enough how important it is to take the extra few minutes and read them before signing. Also, make contracts if loaning/borrowing money and be as detailed as possible. Find a template online if you need to. A lot of people out there will be more than happy to screw you over and sleep well at night. I don't care if you've known them since you were in diapers or just met them ten minutes ago. CYA! That's old school for COVER YOUR ASS! It only takes a few minutes and you will have peace of mind. Honestly, go on YT and watch several shows of The People's Court. I have learned so much as an adult from that show. Minor things we brush off can come back to haunt us. Best of luck out there."
Advice,fctnf0c,t1_fctn3l0,1577950107.0,Couple hundred? Wow. It is worth a shot though. I know many youtubers get a ton of emails and it will get lost in the mix. Better to try than not. You definitely helped me and pointed me in a new direction. Thank you!
Advice,fctn8m6,t3_eiqp4x,1577949881.0,"I would definitely check with local churches and the Salvation Army. I would also try a Community Action center near you and see what they can do or refer you to. I am so sorry you are going through this. I am having many struggles of my own and can empathize. Oh, maybe check on or post on Craigslist or your neighborhood Facebook group! You'd be surprised how generous people can be. Best of luck!"
