You should make the effort to learn what you're supposed to know. At least the basic's, standards and best practices. 

If you don't know them, then read up on them before asking someone unless they are explicitly training you on them. 

If it's something new and you're experienced enough to know that, then asking a person may be the best solution for timeliness.

It's because while even it could maneuver much better, the crew would die. Or at least be severely injured. 

I'm not sure if you have read/listened to the books or not, but high-G maneuvers require drugs and chemical being injected into the crew via the seats. It's painful and harsh on the bodies. And IIRC, expensive. So they tend to not do high-G much.
