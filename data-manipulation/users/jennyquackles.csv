loseit,fflpcey,t3_eu42fv,1580042382.0,I’m logging my weekend! I used to track religiously Monday to Friday then ‘forget’ at the weekend and eat too much of everything. I logged yesterday (Saturday) and I’m logging everything today! This small step should hopefully prevent me binging away my weeks work over the weekend.

AskUK,fenhlqu,t3_eq3hhv,1579284862.0,I’ve just bought one and I really like it. The syrups are a bit expensive but not necessary for sparkling water which is mainly what I use it for. I think it works out at pence more expensive than buying bottled sparking water once you include gas prices but the plastic saved justifies that for me.
