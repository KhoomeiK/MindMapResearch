AskReddit,ffgqaib,t1_fffzveo,1579912330.0,My mom bought me a brand new honda civic when I was 19 - car is almost 11 years old and only has 125k miles on it. I am hoping it lasts me another 100k miles/10 years because I live in LA and this city is a death trap for cars.
AskReddit,ffge9bp,t1_ffgaxb6,1579904288.0,Yeahhhh I decided to stop this conversation when you used the word 'brainwash'-thank you for making your views on women so perfectly clear. :)

AskReddit,ffg9p53,t1_ffg96pw,1579901480.0,"Yes because there are no teams whatsoever where people do the same thing, ie tennis?"
AskReddit,ffg9agj,t1_ffg5v3c,1579901229.0,">It's natures way of literally telling us our roles.

Women who cannot have children or do not want them are not killing themselves with these types of numbers though. So why have they been able to evolve from their evolutionary motives?"
AskReddit,ffg2r11,t1_fffymej,1579897199.0,"Okay, but women are adapting to not adhering to their ""biological drives and motivators"" of not having children without these kinds of numbers. To be honest, I think men have this mentality that a lot will always be given to them and women have always been told to fight for it because they are the inferior species. Women have been fighting hard to the pendulum is swinging the other way and men have begun acting defeated because women are leveling up. It doesn't always have to be one person provides for the family and the other takes care of the children, why can't it be both? That is what men have to learn to accept, that we are not in the 1950s anymore, and life should be a team rather than a ""this is your job and this is mine"" mindset."

AskReddit,fffvw9h,t1_fffny7n,1579892949.0,">Wtf is up with cats?

I heard it is because they are trying to throw off their scent to other animals by spreading their poop scent all around. Mine does it and it is hilarious."
AskReddit,fffvnhu,t3_etbrdf,1579892795.0,"My cat is extremely territorial. My new boyfriend didn't believe me until while we were making out on my couch, my big ol' main coon went behind him and when he went to look to see what my cat was doing, my cat sucker-punched my boyfriend on the face three times with his paw, ran away to my kitchen, started opening and slamming shut the lower kitchen cupboards, and then ran to his litter box to take a massive shit. 

He also would get in between us in bed, put his back to me, stretch all four legs out and slowly put his claws into my boyfriends back and then retract them again. When my boyfriend told him to stop and turned over to go back to sleep, five minutes later my cat did the same thing with all four of his paws, but would only put \*1\* claw into his back. 

They are bffs now because my boyfriend is a morning person and I am not, which is something very useful to my cat."
AskReddit,ffd0lut,t1_ffbic4i,1579811067.0,"> I might just die from frickin grief

I begin to cry anytime I think about it. I don't think I would be able to go on. I know other people have and will, but I would need to be committed."
