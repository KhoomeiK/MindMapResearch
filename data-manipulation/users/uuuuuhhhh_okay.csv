Thanks to gerrymandering, voter suppression, poor voting booths and a Russian propaganda machine our votes will likely not make any difference at all.

What we're actually trying to ""beat"" is a rigged system that relies on voter suppression, gerrymandered districts, and a Russian propaganda campaign designed to spread dissent.

Reform needs to be our goal. Impeachment and removal are a band-aid on a much bigger problem. Sure, register to vote and do your best to get him out of office. But this only gets worse if we don't break the machine that caused this, and that is far more daunting than we realize.
