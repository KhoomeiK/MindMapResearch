whatisthisthing,fde3qjx,t3_ejg5l9,1578330510.0,"Likely solved. I was hoping for a more specific understanding of what it was for, but some sort of multitool for a tractor or other equipment is the most likely answer. Thanks!"

I don't know what the solution is, when there's no water and the temperatures are this high. It's painful to see the flooding in Jakarta, and not be able to help in either situation."
AskReddit,fczj10q,t1_fcmlv3s,1578102312.0,"Thanks, was looking for that one."
whatisthisthing,fcy8ss0,t1_fcxkwqz,1578076456.0,That guy doesn't know what it is either.
whatisthisthing,fcxvgne,t1_fcxprf7,1578071074.0,"Appreciate your comment. He was absolutely hilarious, and delivered the driest of sarcastic remarks with a soft Georgia accent. The kind where syllables get drawn out and added in, and saying ""well bless your heart"" is code for FU. He was also a brilliant engineer whose best inventions got sucked into the military industrial vortex.  Humour was definitely his weapon of choice."
whatisthisthing,fcxkwqz,t3_ejg5l9,1578065425.0,"Digging through images of tractor wrenches, and I found one! No more info than what I had, but at least there's proof there was more than one made - [https://www.ebay.com/itm/113345434917](https://www.ebay.com/itm/113345434917)"
whatisthisthing,fcxjxkd,t1_fcxiqil,1578064763.0,"I had to look up halligan. Ok, there's clearly been hammering done on this thing, you can see the strain around the openings in a few places as well. It looks like quite a bit of force was in use. This one makes the most sense to me, for those square and 6-sided sockets. The ends look more like the drain plug wrenches. I'm wondering if this was specialized for some industry, like maybe trains."
whatisthisthing,fcxino9,t1_fcxia4y,1578063882.0,The ends certainly look similar. Would the various shaped holes fit over other sizes of drain plugs then?

whatisthisthing,fcxi8c5,t1_fcxgu6n,1578063581.0,Interesting! I've always been puzzled by that one hole that doesn't match its framing.

AnatolianShepherdDogs,fcqyixq,t1_fcqwsjc,1577894130.0,"Well, every ASD I've ever met could and would hold their bladder for ridiculously long periods of time, and also had the ability to pee on absolutely everything for hours while out hiking. Camels in the shape of dogs. Getting over excited would reduce bladder control. Livestock Guardian Dog breeds should never peer-play with humans. No teeth on humans ever. No pawing, chewing, tagging, zooming into, tackling, or playing leapfrog over humans. There needs to be a line between ""ways it's ok to play with other dogs"" and ""ways it's ok to play with people."" Always redirect mouthiness and puppy-style play into something else that you're ok with a 100lb dog doing. 

Fetch usually doesn't really work with them because it has nothing to do with security, but some of them will play that way when young. The majority of my interactions with my adult are her coming for affection, or me calling her to me for a physical checkup, which also involves affection. If her attitude is bouncy and play-focused, I give her a raw bone to chew on, or stand aside and laugh while she gets her zoomies out like a racehorse."
AnatolianShepherdDogs,fcqv3nr,t3_eij302,1577892669.0,"You can put a belly band on him for this phase. It's likely related to the fear phase associated with conflicts resulting from hormonal changes. This too shall pass. I'd rule out any urinary infections or issues, and continue to ensure that he's readily able to communicate his need to go out, and get a response to that. Remember, these dogs were not intended to be indoors, and marking territory is part of what they do. Excitable puppies don't always have appropriate responses to strangers at the door anyway. When they're approaching 100lbs, that response becomes highly important. Have a friend come over and work with you on practicing greeting people politely at the door, complete with tasty treats."
offmychest,fcjyc81,t3_ehkpfs,1577710368.0,"Some people get energetically charged by new sights & places, or we wouldn't have adventured far as humans. One of my high school friends decided to visit Bangkok when he was in his 30's, and wound up living and working in the area. It's pretty easy to be a (for example) English as a 2nd Language teacher in some places, which is how he paid his way at first. Settling down wasn't quite enough for him either, and he wrote for a travel magazine for a long time. That gave him the excuse/budget to just go places that interested him and take photos. Guess what I'm saying is - go for it. :)"
politics,fcjuk0h,t3_eheb38,1577705447.0,"So completely wrong for such a selfless lifetime of fighting for others, to be given such a painful death sentence."
AnatolianShepherdDogs,fc9svys,t1_fc3ksno,1577557721.0,"Aww, she looks so uncertain. I don't see any Anatolian in that dog, I see either an underfed adult german shepherd, or perhaps a younger dog that's not finished growing. I'd recommend as much couch-snuggling as she'll allow, and look into her eyes smiling whenever possible."
AnatolianShepherdDogs,fc3i9sg,t3_efyqtl,1577390397.0,"Photos would really help.   
It would be unusual to mix a German Shepherd - a herding breed, with an Anatolian Shepherd Dog, which is a livestock guardian breed. They have very different instinctive behaviors and motivations, so how the final temperament/behavior turns out at adulthood would be anyone's guess. I got an alleged 4 yo female ASD mix from a rescue years ago, and she turned out to be less than 1 year old purebred. My current ASD is also a 120lb purebred; listed as a 75lb GSD mix by the shelter. One pix of your dog from the side, another of the head, pretty please?"
poultry,fc3hn6n,t1_fc2pswf,1577390001.0,"They're quite bold, hardy, and reproduce readily without predation. A friend of mine had a pair on her pond, got distracted with her son's football season at school, and suddenly had 47 of them."
