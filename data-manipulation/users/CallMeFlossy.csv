Generally, something physical that doesn’t require serious mental work. 

I also try to avoid consuming right off the bat — food, internet, etc."

If you are slow or still developing your skills or primarily learning as you go along, then I don't think you'll arrive at a price that feels fair to you or your customers. In that case, cost + how much you feel is a reasonable profit is a better option."

ETA: That jig is using a plunge router. But if you follow /r/caddis789's tip of tilting the bit into the center of the cut, then moving it towards the end marks after it's flush, it will work fine. Just take multiple passes of no more than 1/8"" cutting depth until you reach your desired depth."

marketing,fc8ygvg,t1_fc77kpd,1577544120.0,"I think this advice is not only solid, but extends far beyond the end of life industry.

It's not just identity, as you pointed out, but also the personality of the individual representing that identity. I'll use myself as an example. I have a pretty sincere (some would say ""serious"") personality. I am also the face of our sales force. A ""wacky"" campaign is going to fall flat the minute someone is sitting across the table from me and realizes I'm not an accurate reflection of what they were led to anticipate.

Not having the personality of the copy align with the people customers initially meet is going to make things a degree or two harder."
woodworking,fc8uh2d,t1_fc82k7j,1577542170.0,"[I put this together really quickly for you.](https://craftercompanions.com/downloads/wood/router-repeatable-fixed-groove.pdf) It's pretty much a one-off jig, but it should do the job for you.

Basically, it's just an auxiliary base (8""x10"", 1/2"" thick) with a hole centered for the bit and mounting holes for the router base.

Attach a 1/4"" hardwood track along the length of the base. I'd mount the base to the router before attaching the track, so that you can ensure it's positioned precisely 1/4"" from the edge of the bit.

To use it, the track serves as a fence for the the first cut, positioning it 1/4"" in from the edge of the workpiece. Then move the track into the groove and route the next slot. Repeat as needed.

If your first groove isn't 1/4"" from the edge, route the first groove, then use the jig.

Hope this helps. Happy woodworking."

getdisciplined,fc5frtk,t3_eg8yba,1577456323.0,"As others have mentioned, a routine and some things to do give you momentum. I, too, have the next day's clothes laid out, make my bed immediately (to the dog's chagrin), turn on the coffee pot (set up the night before) and begin a workout. Before you know it, you're moving -- have been moving -- and you really haven't even had to think about it yet.

The ""to-do"" list part of things -- my advice is to have a few easily/quickly accomplished things on it. Mine often includes something as simple as ""knit one row"" for a project I'm working on; or ""add guidelines to drawing."" Takes five minutes, moves things forward, has positive mental movement. 

One last tip I'll add is to awaken to a tidy home. The night before, clean up the kitchen. Do a quick declutter of the main living areas. Avoid throwing your clothes on the floor before crawling into bed. Starting the day in an ordered environment is a great way to begin a new day."
