Then once you prove those points they then go on to say how washed cowboy was. Bare in mind, these are the same people who said before the fight how Conor will start well but Cowboy will get him down the stretch while listing all his accolades, which was completely fine. The petty excuses after the fact are not fine though. Quite embarrassing to the sport, and a great way to keep the meathead stereotype going."

the fundamental wrong process of thought. Corruption was a result of socialism, socialism didn't fail because of corruption. It breeds corruption at its core.
