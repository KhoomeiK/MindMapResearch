Tinder,ffm7qg8,t3_eu48by,1580049950.0,Is that Ugly Naked Guy from Friends???
photography,ffkqhww,t1_ffk8c84,1580027115.0,Thank you!
photography,ffjlqbl,t1_ffj7z52,1580001149.0,Thanks for the information!
M43,ffjl9mx,t3_dnqdrn,1580000829.0,"Was looking on reddit for peoples opinions on this camera (as I think about buying it as my first), when I stumbled upon this picture. My first reaction was holy shit what a beautiful pictire. This is the best eiffeltower picture I have ever seen!"
photography,ffijf0n,t1_ffij9h6,1579975296.0,I was referring to the OLYMPUS OM-D E-M10 Mark II 14-42mm II R Kit. Sorry I didn't clarify that!
photography,ffi0kgo,t1_ffhz8hw,1579961393.0,"I'll keep it in mind, thank you for your insight!"
photography,ffhwoq3,t1_ffhwfqh,1579957257.0,"Thank you for your detailed response!! I also want this to be my learning camera. However when I talk about buying a camera, people try to discourage me as they say that its a waste of money as you could take pictures with your phone. However your response motivates me to go for it!"
photography,ffhw7x6,t3_ethmxr,1579956700.0," I would very much like to get into photography and I found the Olympus  kit for a reasonable price where I live (as it received a pretty good  di scount). However, my friend said that I shouldn't buy it as it is from  2015 and that I should get something newer (this, of course, is more expensive). However, my question is just if its still worth it buying this olympus in 2020? I'm a beginner (only made photos with my phone but want to step it up) and I'm mostly going to take pictures of landscapes, architectures and just travel pictures."
makemychoice,ff4dw38,t3_erklet,1579561294.0,School man!! Dont suck it up until.you retire becauuse thats still a  loooooooooot of years . You will otherwise regret having worked a job you hate for years while you had the chance to change  it.
Erasmus,feth4mf,t1_fetdk4f,1579375404.0,Do you happen to know if employers care about the uni someone went to during erasmus? Because I don't know to be honest.
SuicideWatch,feso2p2,t3_eqg8kz,1579367297.0,"I think the advice others have given you is pretty good. As you are 17 and nearly 18, maybe you can try to find a reason to move out and get some distance between you and your parents. Maybe university/college or just a job"
millionairemakers,feq64fm,t3_eq81a8,1579338111.0,"About to go manditorily abroad for my studies, so this will lighten the weight my study loan has to carry! Anyway just hope that even if it isnt me, he will make good use of it!"
SuicideWatch,fejxi92,t3_epeyn6,1579188106.0,I'm happy for you!! Hope you can get yourself entirely back on rails! We are rooting here for you
netflixwitcher,feermjr,t3_eooulo,1579039731.0,Perfect!!
Tinder,fe4cm5i,t3_ens1at,1578857889.0,Not a really good one no. At least he didnt ask for nudes 4/10
Tinder,fdrctrd,t1_fdrbysr,1578682619.0,"True, I understand what you mean yeah. Tinder isnt made for finding friends and she should look for another app yes. If someone is interested in becoming friends, they'll swipe right on her and most of the time not. But about the dirty words, that doesnt need to be per se on tinder if you catch my drift."
makemychoice,fdqs4ep,t3_ekuhrc,1578673699.0,"1 semester, you have to balance fun and money. You have made some fun in the first semester I guess, now you have to compare if the extra money is worth the new experiences that you will receive if you stay an extra semester. As i see you are worried about the money not enabling you to spend too much, i think you should go back. What experiences will you get by staying another month, is there much new stuff to see/do/live? Or more of the same?"
makemychoice,fdqr8zt,t3_emrje5,1578673164.0,No
Tinder,fdq2z76,t1_fdpxb63,1578652323.0,"The tinder culture turned itself into dirty words and stuff, however not everyone is a fan of that of course. Maybe there are some people who'd like to use tinder but not in a way most people do."
Tinder,fdlp7lu,t3_em09oc,1578529205.0,Too harsh man
makemychoice,fd9ib9w,t1_fd9i8hp,1578233727.0,Thanks smilebot!!
makemychoice,fd9i7wr,t3_ekd02t,1578233666.0,"First one, be productive, not like us :("
makemychoice,fcxjcma,t3_ej4iyw,1578064363.0,"I guess don't. Wigs are pretty expensive, and maybe your fiance would think you to be less attractive. Think about it for some more time and talk about it with your fiance. Maybe it is an impulsive decision so take some time to think about it."
makemychoice,fcxj075,t3_ejb6k1,1578064125.0,"Wait for the PS5, the ps4 is getting to the end of its lifetime and it will be better for you to save some more money and get something that will last you many more years than if you buy a ps4. Until then, play some other games on your pc or switch"
makemychoice,fcxisws,t3_ejf8cz,1578063984.0,"Econ with a Cs Minor, follow what you love but which also can get you a job. Economists are always needed so you'll find a job. Especially some knowledge about CS will make you more attractive for recruiters as that is something good to have next to economics"
SuicideWatch,fcaaqyz,t1_fca3gpb,1577565769.0,"You don't deserve anything bad, you might feel worthless but that doesnt mean you should punish yourself or even kill yourself. What is bothering you to make you want to take your life?"
SuicideWatch,f7omj25,t3_dx8wz2,1573929929.0,"May he rest in peace, he sounded like a really nice guy to have known"
