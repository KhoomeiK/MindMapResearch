oddlyterrifying,ffl57jh,t1_ffk53wt,1580035010.0,We had coyotes roaming our neighborhood once. I woke up to their crying in the middle of the night. It makes your blood run cold.
roanoke,ffhuoev,t1_ffglx9h,1579954748.0,Lou's has mail order deep dish. They're amazing.
ChoosingBeggars,ffht357,t1_ffhksqt,1579952492.0,"I'm in a mutual sharing agreement with my best friend. She has cable, so I use her log in for HBO go/cable stuff and she uses my Hulu and Amazon Prime. 

I've had someone ask to use my Hulu and at no point offered anything in return/even said thank you. So I changed the password and told her I had to cancel it."
UpliftingNews,ffhsvs9,t1_ffh5o33,1579952189.0,"I'm in the same boat. I work for an insurance company and the only plans they offer are high deductible. 



We were recently merged with another company and their plans start in the middle of the year. So, if you meet your deductible before the new plan year starts in June, you get to start again. We have a baby due in March, so we'll definitely hit that deductible."
badwomensanatomy,ffg9spr,t1_fffxv7c,1579901541.0,"Man. I had the opposite post children. Had no problem conceiving #1 but trying for #2 ended in a PCOS diagnosis. Eventually got pregnant with medicinal help. 

After this one, shop is closed for business. If they could just scoop everything out and it didn't require hormones, I'd totally do it."
notliketheothergirls,fffthf4,t1_fffnbh8,1579891445.0,Have you ever had a fun dip shooter? It's magical. Tastes like pure candy.
TheRightCantMeme,fff2xxn,t1_ffej2ck,1579874277.0,Now you need to spill details!
UpliftingNews,fff1uvo,t1_ffdtva3,1579873407.0,Which I don't understand how they haven't seen the booms in economy in the states that have legalized it.
UpliftingNews,fff1n9u,t1_ffdungl,1579873232.0,It's in fine print on the marriage certificate. My husband and I barely squeaked in under the wire. /s
AskReddit,ffdpymx,t1_ffbv1k1,1579826166.0,"I had started a new job and a couple months in, they found out I like to make cupcakes. It was something I definitely did as a hobby in college. Our director was retiring and they brought me in and asked if I'd make cupcakes. 450 cupcakes for $25. They ended up having some elderly ladies make a couple sheet cakes instead."
AskMen,ffctpja,t1_ffbqzhz,1579807060.0,"I don't wear mine, but my husband puts his on every day. I've never really been a ring/jewelry person. Currently 8 months pregnant, no one is hitting on me."
gardening,ff8uosg,t1_ff8fsaq,1579696712.0,"I'm sure we do. When we bought the house, it was just these Holly bushes in the flower bed and they looked fairly new. We pulled up photos of the house when it was initially sold before us and the amount of over growth that they cut back on Smooth Sumac (still have shoots and stumps popping up everywhere) and Holly was insane."
gardening,ff7stu9,t1_ff6qvzn,1579657513.0,We had Holly bushes that were in front of our house. Had them chopped down when we had a Bradford Pear removed from our front yard. Somehow we didn't dig up a single root or two and they're sprouting everywhere. We literally cannot kill them and they continue to pop up.
AskReddit,ff6z71d,t3_es06ay,1579637909.0,Honey Crisp are my go to. The crunch is so satisfying.
AskReddit,ff6z340,t1_ff6y0qv,1579637845.0,I wasn't as impressed with the Cosmic Crisp as I wanted to be. It was good but I don't know if it was good enough to justify the price vs a honey crisp.
relationship_advice,ff67rtb,t1_ff5sszv,1579621150.0,"While I was pregnant, I basically lived in my husband's underwear because they were super stretchy and comfy. Everything can just breathe better."

instantkarma,ff655k8,t1_ff5wjpf,1579619379.0,"There's a stretch of highway near us that has the 'commercial vehicles prohibited in left lane' when it becomes 3 lanes. Yet, for some reason several don't think that applies to them. Like ok, we're now going 15 under because you thought you could get around them. Thanks!"
NoStupidQuestions,ff2yqgk,t1_ff0pgfu,1579528878.0,They were spoofing the phone number for my work phone and calling me with that number. I never picked up because it was listed as outside of my service area for work until I decided to Google it and my own contact info popped up.
science,feqjgl2,t1_fepm5la,1579342572.0,This is why I don't beat myself up over the occasional Jimmy Johns sandwich while pregnant. Currently 32 weeks with second kid and there's never been a listeria recall on deli meat. Now bagged lettuce and ice cream and frozen vegetables on the other hand...
AskReddit,feofkwc,t1_fenbkyx,1579299524.0,Congratulations! Currently at 32 weeks and July seems so long ago when I found out but it goes by so quickly at the same time!
AskReddit,feof1vx,t1_feo75ns,1579299216.0,Same. I just finished my masters and grand total is over 80k including undergrad. Even with income based repayment plans in place I'm paying over $400 a month and it's killing us. I figured that masters would have raised my income at least a tiny bit.
gaming,fenni94,t1_fen43y4,1579288222.0,Man. I loved my SP.
AnimalCrossing,fen87oj,t1_fen3u0h,1579279107.0,That's ideal scenario. What else are you going to do. You can't really run around.
AnimalCrossing,fen39jb,t3_eq0kqb,1579276003.0,Our due date is 4 days before release. I'm excited to play during late night wake up feedings.
Showerthoughts,fejlxz8,t1_fejctz0,1579179360.0,Orgasms cause the uterus/cervix to contract which may kick start labor. Others say it's because the sperm can soften the cervix.
Showerthoughts,fejltop,t1_fejb9ir,1579179246.0,"Currently 32 weeks, I can barely breathe, let alone enjoy sex. I couldn't even imagine full term sex."
eatsandwiches,fehdgkq,t1_feh30km,1579114285.0,I was so confused. The recipe says chicken burger but that definitely looks like beef. But putting buffalo chicken dip ON a burger would be incredible.
politics,fegkw6s,t1_fefx7q4,1579095939.0,"Brought this up to my mother (very conservative). My grandmother went through cancer treatment for years and we found out they remortgaged their home to pay medical. Now that Grandma has passed, grandpa has zero savings and a house that the mortgage is higher than when they bought it 20 years ago. Mom also has several health issues and routinely bitches about her high deductible and price of insurance. 

I brought up the fact that literally none of those costs would exist with M4A."
AfterpartyTheGame,fef113o,t3_eoteia,1579045654.0,"If you have game pass, play it there. There's always trials for game pass/ultimate. I just did a 3 mo trial for $1."
BabyBumps,feezma5,t1_feekxny,1579044730.0,I wish we had done this. My grandpa walked into the room during my induction because my grandma was a couple floors below getting her treatment so he thought he'd just stop by. HE STAYED FOR SO LONG but I was so exhausted I didn't think to tell him to GTFO.
BabyBumps,feeyzve,t1_feed9cg,1579044329.0,"I referred to #1 as Donkey Kong (last name). When they kind of laughed and then asked 'no really, what are you naming her' I'd deadpan and say it's a family name."
BabyBumps,feeyodv,t1_feejq53,1579044120.0,"I had the opposite issue with my first. Baby wouldn't latch, she screamed so much (because she was hungry and I couldn't express enough) and it was like I wanted to throw her in the trash when I asked them for formula. They ended up bringing us this tubing to syringe formula through on our finger to not get her nipple confused instead of just letting us give her the bottle."
aww,feeuzs4,t1_feeuh5b,1579041793.0,"Oh same. If I had found out while I was a teenager, where the relationship with my mom was trash, I probably would have done something dramatic."
aww,feeu80n,t1_fee8ule,1579041316.0,I found my birth mother on Facebook just because I was curious. I never contacted her though because I'm not sure I want to open that box.
aww,feetxr9,t1_feep6c6,1579041139.0,It's definitely one of those things that at first I felt SUPER weird. Like my whole life was some weird lie. But they're still my parents.
aww,feeixdn,t1_feeewhx,1579034680.0,"I think a lot of it was, 'well we can't tell her now, let's just pretend like it didn't happen.'"
aww,fee9ldq,t1_fee4tsh,1579029226.0,"This is the way to do it. I found out I was adopted when I was 22. Grandma let it slip during Christmas one year, as my parents had told her I knew so she'd stop asking them to tell me. 

It was definitely a shock and made things make way more sense."
AmItheAsshole,fee3fxk,t1_fedodrn,1579025598.0,Right. I think it'd be different if he had tweeted/posted on Instagram but this is def NTA.
insanepeoplefacebook,feacdh5,t1_fea34tc,1578946951.0,Definitely. When I left my last job it was for just over 10k pay increase. I mentioned it when I gave my two weeks and they laughed and said....well....good luck!
insanepeoplefacebook,fe84xqr,t1_fe7p3mb,1578922627.0,Some times. Depending on what part of the generation they fall in. My mom is a Boomer and I was born in 90. She's towards the cut off I believe.
insanepeoplefacebook,fe84pdy,t1_fe7pzki,1578922534.0,"I've ended up switching jobs every two years or so so my pay increases. Sorry that the 2% increases aren't cutting it. I'm now making almost 20k more than I was in 2015 because I didn't stay at that job.



 If I was still there, my pay would have gone up a whopping 4% (maybe!) at this point (not including the yearly increase in health insurance costs that always conveniently mirrored our increases)."
personalfinance,fdqnyps,t1_fdqhr2w,1578671116.0,"We did something similar. My husband stays home during the day and (luckily) his job lets him work evenings. So we basically switch off. We don't see each other much but for what we were going to pay in daycare, we make it work."
worldnews,fdqn48n,t1_fdqhsx7,1578670583.0,"Not only that, you're paying monthly for it but also before it helps at all, hopefully you have 4500 laying around for that deductible."
AskReddit,fdn14wn,t1_fdm4tca,1578574071.0,"We have a 3 year old. Some days she'll eat 2 bites, some days she'll clear her plate. When we're at the inlaws, they continue to offer her something different, hoping she'll eat more. Stop. If she's hungry, she'll eat."
AskReddit,fdkzm6y,t1_fdkr3mn,1578514415.0,That's the exact image I always had in my head was a mineshaft with a track going through it.
LifeProTips,fdkwrnn,t1_fdjr31p,1578512758.0,"Someone I worked with (so a grown ass adult) referred to hers as her Marianne. Like woman, you've had two children, it's a vagina/vulva. 

My 3 year old refers to hers as a vagina and it's always a shock to the grandparents. She also thinks it's hilarious to throw it into our body part naming songs/game."
MadeMeSmile,fdkuz8j,t1_fdkamcv,1578511702.0,"I had the same thing happen, the gelatin caps kind of all melted together. It was horrible to pull them apart."
AskReddit,fdjs7nc,t1_fdihukt,1578485583.0,"When I worked at social services, I saw a family with Havoc and Riot. I could not believe it. Had to have them verify spellings to double check that's what the names said."
AskReddit,fdihvyh,t1_fdh0rkp,1578443279.0,"Ugh. We hear that constantly in Virginia. We had snow today and it's going to be 70 on Saturday. We get it 'if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes'"
BabyBumps,fdi0nmp,t1_fdhqru7,1578433629.0,"Dude...the hip pain can fuck right off. I haven't been able to lay on my side in 12+ weeks, so I've been sleeping in a weird hybrid recliner/hospital bed prop up and I'm over itttttttt."
1200isplenty,fdi07yc,t1_fdhocmf,1578433393.0,Can agree. Our KK burned down a few years back and they had recently rebuilt one. The lines to get hot donuts even 5 years later is ridiculous. I'm much more of a cake donut fan.
MurderedByWords,fdhgbjn,t1_fdgu07b,1578422039.0,"As an adult, when I realized green beans didn't HAVE to be mushy and from a can, they became 100 times better."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdfjrd6,t1_fdf7f7b,1578363337.0,"I came off of my birth control when we decided to have kids. I always assumed I just never had a sex drive. Turns out it was the birth control that completely ruined it.  Currently pregnant with #2 and have zero plans on future children, also zero plans to go back on birth control."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdeii89,t1_fddnnxi,1578339747.0,But like....a good hot dog off the grill is amazing. I'll take that over a hamburger any day.
AmItheAsshole,fddr6zm,t1_fddizgw,1578321835.0,"Oh my god. I am so sorry. Any time we go to Disney, I have the utmost respect for the cast members there because I couldn't IMAGINE dealing with that amount of people on a daily basis, especially those that are entitled and crazy rude."
BabyBumps,fd9ruek,t3_ekdwax,1578237214.0,I'm on #2 and didn't feel movement until after 19 weeks. I wouldn't worry too much.
BabyBumps,fd8wx9k,t1_fd8ib56,1578224660.0,"I think the station, only because I know when I worked as admin in a hospital, nurses couldn't reheat patients food for them if it was in their room (for infection reasons maybe?). So probably for procedure/safety, the station would be better."
MildlyVandalised,fd8vugr,t1_fd7i70i,1578224164.0,"Very similar to what Coca Cola did with the names on the bottles. I don't drink coke but ended up buying one because it actually had my name spelled correctly. 

Marketing, man."
todayilearned,fd3t9ed,t1_fd2tu73,1578161427.0,The amount of people who don't understand that men can rear children as well is insane. My husband stays home during the day (works evenings so we switch when I get off work) and the amount of people that comment on him doing all the parent stuff at her school is crazy.
starterpacks,fd2a4kl,t1_fd28v9f,1578144098.0,We had Pop tarts (usually store brand though) pretty consistently. But toaster strudels were an exciting surprise when they were purchased. It was like fucking Christmas.
