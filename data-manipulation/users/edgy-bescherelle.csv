askteenboys,fdoh65x,t1_fdofc11,1578605060.0,"My girlfriend. She has the same kind of fantasies so that’s cool. Remember: it’s fantasies, which means that it isn’t actually what I want to do every seconds of my life but only when I’m horny. However, I think that her fantasies were caused by past traumatic experiences, so I don’t think I will ever try to do that kind of stuff with her."

Besides that, I’m a really gentle dom and fucking love giving affection, cuddling and kissing so I’m kind of confused as to why I have those fantasies"

askteenboys,fdgs9v1,t3_elbwjj,1578407021.0,"Ordinary stuff honestly, like when the train is late, or when the bus is late or when a teacher is absent so you have to stay at school while doing nothing for an hour (teachers aren’t replaced when they are absent for less than a week here). Idk, I just don’t really care and don’t have much better to do so daily inconveniences don’t bother me, I usually laugh and try to make my friends laugh too so they aren’t too frustrated that something like that happened. As I said, I know it’s probably just me though, because I don’t do anything during my free time unlike my friends who go out and do sports or whatnot and actually have stuff planned"

depression,fd2q607,t1_fczdq29,1578150589.0,"Yes, pretty useful when you’re confused. However, sometimes I don’t say it out loud and instead I close my eyes and picture myself above my body. By doing so, I try to destroy all my ego (notion of self) and look at my situation objectively. pretty cool too"
depression,fcz733v,t1_fcz55tq,1578094994.0,"I know it shouldn’t make me feel better but knowing that someone has a similar experience kind of does.. I’m sorry for your loss, and I really am since I can imagine what it felt like. And don’t worry, sometimes I do the same: I talk about my problems out loud to myself. I don’t do this to vent to myself or anything, I do it to analyse my situation and find a way of coping with it or whatnot :)"
depression,fcz3iik,t1_fcwsfku,1578092924.0,"Same here. I haven’t properly cried since 4 years and that was because my life long friend died (my dog). I was 12 I think and getting my emotions ignored is probably what’s made me unable to cry since then. I dropped a few tears because of a really relatable video a few months ago but that’s about it. It sucks, really sucks. I often feel like crying, letting it all out would help a ton but I just can’t. It’s as if you weren’t able to ride a bike because you don’t have a good balance anymore even though you learned to ride as a kid, it’s really frustrating and it feels like you can’t help it"

You see, there’s nothing you need to really understand here. Depression is a mental illness, you can have it even if your life may seem perfect to others. It’s literally caused by a chemical reaction. If you think you may suffer from depression, try to get an appointment with a psychologist and then you’ll know for sure. A therapist might also be a good idea, so consider it. Good luck and don’t give up"
