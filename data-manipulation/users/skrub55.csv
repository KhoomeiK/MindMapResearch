You could wonder if that meant you couldn't loan your phone to someone to work on, and that's where the line is blurry. The principles of socialism should indicate that so long as you do not charge him to use the phone it is fine, but realistically in a socialist society with wealth evenly distributed, if someone you weren't in a position of power over wanted to pay you $20 to borrow the phone and make a commission, no one would stop you, even if that is technically a capitalist relation"
