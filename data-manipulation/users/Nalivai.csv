Left wingers will vote only for their ideal candidate and only if they could be persuaded and there is enough stamps lying around.   
That's why it's extremely important to counteract that attitude by just voting. It's not ""voting is useless so I wouldn't"", it's ""I wouldn't vote, thus rendering voting useless""."
