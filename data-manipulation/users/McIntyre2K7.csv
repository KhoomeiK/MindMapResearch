AskReddit,ffvi2pp,t3_ev5zdg,1580264619.0,Like 3 weeks ago watching King of the Hill on Hulu. I got to the Series finale. Bobby finally joined a team and they made it to state. Hank got to watch Bobby win a state championship. They went back home and grilled together. After 13 seasons they finally found something they could do together.

CFB,ffvgnsk,t3_ev62ar,1580263676.0,Not gonna lie to you. What college football needs is another 2007 season.
WrestlemaniaPlans,ffv5xd1,t1_ffv1egi,1580256444.0,Midnight during the week. 2am on the weekends. However if there’s an event at Amalie Arena which will be on Thursday-Saturday and Monday. It should run until 2am. It’s free and once comes every 15 minutes. As we get closer I’ll post the actual schedule for mania week.
WrestlemaniaPlans,ffsg8mz,t1_ffqahh3,1580180957.0,It would be nice if AEW has an event on the Wednesday after Mania but I feel like everyone might be flying out on Tuesday morning.
videos,ffjlzfb,t1_ffjgc01,1580001316.0,You gotta desperate the character from the real person. Cliff Huxtable was a good father. As far as Bill Cosby is concerned. He can get a first class ticket to hell wearing a gasoline jumpsuit.
WrestlemaniaPlans,ffgr8py,t1_ffgr268,1579913018.0,Parking for Events at Amalie???? It’s in downtown. There are tons of parking lots and parking garages. Parking shouldn’t be a big deal.
AskReddit,ffcd3vm,t3_esr647,1579796864.0,Going to work......

Daughter to parents: how did I get handsome?

WrestlemaniaPlans,ffavr9x,t1_ffav8xl,1579745618.0,"It would be the bus. I would say it would be a 30-45 minute ride. You can take the bus to Ybor, jump on the streetcar and the street car will drop you off right in front of Amalie arena.  You can take public transit to the events. You might just need to Uber back to your hotel room. I’m trying collaborate with the local transit agency to see if there will be routes running if mania ends after midnight for some reason."
WrestlemaniaPlans,ffaup38,t1_ffarfpc,1579744914.0,"You can stay in that area. If you are looking at a hotel that's on Busch Blvd, only pick the Holiday Inn. The other hotels are really sketchy. There's a Wingate, La Quinta and Home2 just north of Busch Gardens and those aren't a bad choice. You would be able to take public transit from those the hotels in the area to ybor to see the smaller events. You can even take it downtown for the WWE events as well."
WrestlemaniaPlans,ff9mep1,t1_ff9cyrl,1579716044.0,I know AEW said they would never run a show on Mania week. Maybe they will have a show on the Wednesday after mania. Then again most people might leave on Tuesday morning.

WrestlemaniaPlans,ff8yan6,t1_ff8y1ma,1579699958.0,I don’t think it’s booked. If it was for a concert or event we would have known by now. Tickets are usually on sale for MONTHS before the event takes place. I could also see them holding the arena just in case the basketball teams make a post season tourney.
WrestlemaniaPlans,ff8xwhz,t1_ff8xs7o,1579699630.0,Yuengling Center fka the USF Sun Dome. But I could see some shady shit going on behind the scenes because the same people that manage Amalie Arena also mange this arena as well.
WrestlemaniaPlans,ff8u7e2,t3_es50k5,1579696233.0,"That’s the thing I don’t get. Why did ROH choose Lakeland when there’s a 10,000 seat arena in a same town not being used during Mania week?"
KingOfTheHill,ff8tx8g,t1_ff8rbw7,1579695946.0,I agree with you. The fact that Hank kept saying Bobby ain’t right only for him to go on and do something they both loved. Plus Bobby getting a state championship was the icing on the cake.
AmericanAthletic,ff4kdi9,t3_er860w,1579565724.0,"Nope. There’s no reason for the AAC to expand when the B12 is going to fall apart in 2024. They could take the B12 leftovers (WVU, Iowa State, Kansas State and 2 additional schools) to make 16. Boise had its change to join the Big East and then they ditched it at the last second."
NCAAFBseries,ff4k0qk,t1_ff3wx2n,1579565475.0,"I get where you are coming from but I bought it because I wanted to support the smaller developers. Plus that game came out MONTHS before the NCAA said that players can profit on their likeness. I would assume next years version will be better and people will probably have the option of doing roster share and on-line play. To be honest I’ve think I’ve played it less than 10 times since buying it. 

I think the whole loot boxes thing kinda sucks. I came from an age where there were only two ways to unlock stuff. You either beat the game or you entered cheat codes. This paying extra for unique items is bs.

tampa,fer7cio,t1_feplpkw,1579350712.0,I forgot about those as well. I could see those climate controlled ones being turned into little studio apartments only to charge outrageous prices. Only a matter of time until someone converts them into apartments.
tampa,fepk0c2,t1_fepjmja,1579322488.0,"I think it is. I live down the street from that Publix. When I left I drove by the Kmart and they had a sign up saying “Florida Mall” coming soon. If anything I thought the old Kmart could have been a Bowling Alley. As far as the storage facilities, there were only 2 of them i knew of: the one on 56th north of Fowler and the other one by King High. I do see they built one on Flower and now the old bowling alley on Busch is a storage facility."
tampa,fephooq,t1_fepfo0t,1579320765.0,I’ve never been to Grove Wesley Chapel. They had a better chance of buying the old Bowling Alley on Busch. It also looks like a flea market is going to come to the old K-Mart next to the Publix on Busch. I guess it kinda makes sense as Big Top Flea Market is going to close.
tampa,fepeq0b,t1_fepdxn9,1579318663.0,If that was the case then they should have just copied what’s going in Westchase. They have the shops on the first floor with apartments above it.
tampa,fepc2zt,t1_fel179v,1579316874.0,True. I thought the only reason Downtown Temple Terrace didn’t pan out is because the city and the developer didn’t see eye to eye when it came to the height of the buildings?
WrestlemaniaPlans,felqc46,t1_felq2u8,1579228359.0,Unfortunately it’s in September and yes that salad is good.
WrestlemaniaPlans,feloi8y,t1_felm6ii,1579227094.0,That restaurant is really popular. It’s really packed on 1903 day. (This is the one day of the year where the prices were the same as they were in 1903).
WrestlemaniaPlans,felodjr,t1_fdfsnem,1579227004.0,Is it a good area??? It’s a good area.
tampa,feitf83,t1_feih5za,1579146740.0,I feel like they are waiting until the area around the mall is redeveloped then they will sell the mall.
tampa,fed7bu4,t1_febyarb,1579002271.0,Not really. When Metro Rapid absorbed the Route 2 it became slower. Heck half the time I’m driving from work and I see the Metro Rapid on 275 because traffic cause it to fall behind schedule.
tampa,fed78k4,t1_fe9paah,1579002163.0,I believe the Sligh Ave route is coming back at the end of March. Along with another route that goes on Livingston Ave north of Bearss. I think didn’t do the changes back in October as they needed time to get the new busses.

WrestlemaniaPlans,fdrjg9e,t1_fdri93v,1578685345.0,Correct. You can take to it Amalie and the convention center for WWE Axxess as well.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fdp1pz5,t1_fdmdn1d,1578617914.0,It depends on what time you are going. There's a bus near the hotel you are staying that goes to Ybor City and Downtown. You could always catch a bus to it and if the event ends late you can take a uber home.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fdlwlum,t1_fdhx3wk,1578534249.0,If you are near the international plaza there is a bus you can take that will drop you off at the stadium. No need to walk.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fdlwgus,t1_fcx1645,1578534155.0,You're right by the Yungeling factory. They offer free tours as they are America's oldest brewery. You are down the street from Busch Gardens. As most of the events are either in Ybor or Downtown you are good.

todayilearned,fdltgq2,t1_fdlpy1u,1578532096.0,FWIW they did it to almost every major city that had a trolley company. GM and the oil companies must have blackmailed mayors.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fdlsr2u,t1_fdlpt9b,1578531615.0,Don't think that's going to happen we have cruise ships that leave from downtown as well as the Port of Tampa nearby.  You would be able to canoe or boat down the river.

AskReddit,fdh9sd6,t3_elekbj,1578418461.0,In the NFL. I think that both teams should get a chance to get the ball in overtime. No kickoffs just start the with ball at your own 40 yard line.

WrestlemaniaPlans,fdgkwk2,t1_fddkk4d,1578400765.0,I have no idea what you are talking about. I live in Temple Terrace and it’s not bad at all. Plus the area that you are talking about is still Tampa. Temple Terrace starts like 2 miles east of Busch Gardens. Now there’s a part south of the river that is kinda sketchy.

He actually had a map as well that showed all the cities around the world that were invaded. It sucks that we will not get any more episodes. We didn’t find out Colony was cancelled until the day of the season finale. USA was so tight lipped about it.
colony,fdefgin,t1_fcy6j7x,1578337870.0,He did not. I think he’s never going to reveal them just in case it gets a reboot in the future. However he did say that the humans would remain under occupation.

WrestlemaniaPlans,fd5w1ai,t1_fd5v4rn,1578182209.0,Yea. That’s northwest of the airport if I’m not mistaken. It’s the suburbs and strip malls.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fd5aqkv,t1_fcxb2d3,1578175803.0,You can take redcoach back to Orlando as well. They have a shuttle that goes to the airport as well since the station is 5 minutes away from the airport.

As far as the intercity service from Tampa to Orlando that is possibly the cheapest of the options. With the RedCoach service you would probably need to take a uber from the station to Disney.


EDIT: As for the public transit. I have created a map above that has the buses that will go near the stadium."
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcta9bx,t1_fct9zdu,1577937103.0,I will add parking spots tomorrow.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcss4cd,t1_fcspxlk,1577923716.0,Yea that area looks sketchy however it is going through a redevelopment phase. You are down the street from the La Segunda Bakery. If you want a Cuban Sandwich that is one of the places I would go to.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcrtieo,t1_fcrh3ro,1577906413.0,"Your welcome. Here are some additional options:

Megabus: https://us.megabus.com/

WrestlemaniaPlans,fcrab42,t1_fcpzuvi,1577899056.0,"I will add those areas to the map as well. Some of the tourist areas: Hyde Park, Downtown Tampa, Seminole Heights, Busch Gardens (theme park) and Adventure Island (across the street from Busch Gardens), Zoo Tampa, Florida Aquarium, Ybor. 

As far as least safe. I feel safe everywhere in Tampa.  Ybor City is safe at night however, don't go North of Interstate 4. If you travel up 22nd Street."
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcr8obb,t1_fcr5jne,1577898390.0,"So there are multiple options to get from Orlando to Tampa. My suggestion would be to use Red Coach. The station is 5 minutes away from Orlando International Airport. They have a express bus that goes from their station to Downtown Tampa and round trip will cost you $20. Just make sure you select ""Orlando Red Coach Station to Tampa-Downtown."" The link to the website is below. Hope this helps.

WrestlemaniaPlans,fcossp7,t1_fcmn5k7,1577840572.0,The mods said they would. I will reach out to them again.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcosqd5,t1_fcnlfhi,1577840523.0,Public transit for the shows at Amalie. As the route that goes by the place you are staying at stops running after midnight.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcoslj6,t1_fcny1be,1577840425.0,Correct but there are no toll booths in Tampa. They got rid of them for the toll by plate/sunpass as the old toll booths were holding up traffic.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcoqo7m,t1_fcoqj1g,1577838985.0,True but I would reach out to the promoter and see if they are allowed to serve alcohol before selling your tix.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcocwwr,t1_fcocmq5,1577829166.0,It is a safe area.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fco62oz,t1_fcny4hc,1577824771.0,Seminole Heights. It’s centrally located close to Downtown and Ybor. You are close to restaurants as well.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcmaofi,t1_fcm9dh7,1577768875.0,"Thank you. I just want you guys to have a good experience here. 

Zoo Tampa and the Florida Aquarium do have extra experiences you can add. There's some other's as well. I'm working on a huge guide that I will post here when I'm done.

If you want a good Cuban I would suggest West Tampa Sandwich Shop."
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcmab0i,t1_fcm9l2k,1577768553.0,"Yea, that is normal. Just give yourself some extra time just in case of an accident. There are 3 bridges into Tampa if there's an accident on one then the others become parking lots."
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcm9u29,t1_fcm9nkf,1577768156.0,Unfortunately it does not.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcm91te,t1_fcm8tw6,1577767506.0,So the streetcar goes from Downtown to Ybor City. Unfortunately you would need to Uber or drive.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcm8tfj,t1_fcm881e,1577767317.0,You sure can ask for it when you get to the car rental place. There is plenty of parking spaces. I’ll add them to the map that I created tomorrow as well.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fcm56qr,t1_fcm4hk4,1577764527.0,In Tampa it is toll by plate. They will take a picture of a plate and send it to the registered owner. If you are doing a rental just ask them for a sunpass for tolls. Which toll road are you using if you don’t mind me asking?
WrestlemaniaPlans,fclyyb8,t1_fclv0cy,1577759916.0,Also. Axxess is in walking distance of the arena. The only thing that wont be close is the stadium for Mania. I have created a new Q&A post as well.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fclymjq,t1_fclvsrj,1577759678.0,We have 2. The Selmon Crosstown and The Veterans Expressway. The Crosstown runs through downtown Tampa. The Veterans starts near the airport. They are both toll by plate so you won’t see any toll booths on them.
WrestlemaniaPlans,fclu553,t1_fcltn0b,1577756525.0,You can't go wrong either was as it's really cheap to rent a car from Tampa International Airport. It would depend on where you are staying. The shows that are in Ybor and the WWE shows at Amalie Arena and WWE Axxess (convention center) are connected by a free streetcar that you can take and it runs every 15 minutes. You could always drive to a parking garage in the area an take the streetcar.
