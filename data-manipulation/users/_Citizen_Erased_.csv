There’s a bunch of drug related communities out there that have been around longer and have more respectful people.

interestingasfuck,ff4tba1,t3_ermcug,1579571940.0,"Ok everyone. I know you’re mad that you’ve never been able to see these, but bear with me. It’s all about getting double vision. If you’re looking at the wall and put your finger close to your face, do you see 2 fingers? That’s double vision. If you can make your finger double by looking at something farther away with your hand in front of your eyes, you can see a magic eye puzzle. The trick is to get exactly the right amount of doubling. If you drew two dots on a white piece of paper, you could double them into four dots, right? Well what if you took the two middle dots and lined them up, so now you see three. That’s the ticket right there. Getting that perfect alignment. Everyone has the ability to do this, but if they don’t know how it’s supposed to work it can be horribly frustrating. Just stare at the picture with various distances of double vision until the 3D image begins to appear. Your visual cortex might take over and try to lock on to this. Be sure to relax and go with it if it does. The proper doubling distance is probably only a centimeter or two. Good luck you guys, I have faith in you!"
