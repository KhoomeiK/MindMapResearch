Don't get me wrong, I largely agree with several of their positions. Im a Canadian conservative, so while I am more right than left when it comes to my countries politics, im pretty far left compared to most Americans. I fully support radical changes to the education sector, up to and including free tuition. I also support Universal Basic Income, I feel like its an inevitability in a capitalist society, and while I want to maintain a capitalist society, we need to provide for the basic needs of our citizens. And finally I support medical care for all. It does work up here in Canada, and it would be painful at first with the massive health insurance industry come crashing down, but it would eventually be beneficial and cost saving for society as a whole. However I find it frustrating when people with similar left leaning views understate the undertaking that these things are. America has specific attributes that make these things cost astronomically more than the European counterparts (and Canada/Australia to a degree) that Americans love to talk about. Canada for example is larger geographically than the US, far more rural outside of major cities, and our healthcare gets stretched in rural areas due to geographical and budget concerns. This is inevitable. The US is not much smaller than Canada, and has 10x more population. The costs of implementing is just going to be inherently more expensive in the US due to the geography and population. Thats not to say it shouldn't happen, but it would be essentially the most expensive single national program in American history. 

I feel that many current Republicans dont uphold Conservative values. I could never vote for Trump if I was an American citizen, purely out of objection to his demeanor, his misuse of the American military, and his position on the Second Amendment.  With that being said, I can understand why some people will refuse to vote for Democrats, given some worrying positions on both the first and second amendment. Ultimately partisan issues on both sides will dominate political discourse with a first past the post system. Both sides use fringe issues that aren't as politically critical compared to a solid economy, an equitable system of laws, and an excellent standard of living for our citizens. They over  appeal to the most radical parts of their base in order to find a partisan reason to hate somebody. For example,, immigration is the gun control of the Republican party.  First amendment is the abortion issue for the Democrats.  A proportional system such as MMP that allows proportionality while also allowing representation for rural communities would be ideal.

>Depends on the things though. Things that are scare should need to be paid for, but reasonable prices and reasonable assurances should also be given. A million dollar beach house in Malibu shouldn't be a basic right, a small apartment with a basic kitchen, bathroom, shower, and bed should. 

So a small apartment in Malibu with basic amenities should be free? Because the house itself has little to do with the cost, its the cost of the land. How do you propose providing housing for everybody when everybody wants to live in major coastal cities? You can already get cheap/subsidized housing by moving to rural areas that are desperate for workers. This is just yet another completely unrealistic daydream by an uneducated socialist teenager. Again, things cost money.

>We already have ""free"" water, food, and and air. Or we have a system for the subsidization of those things. Food stamps, for instance. And laws that require companies to provide free water to anyone who asks for it. The next goals of society should be making housing and healthcare a priority. 

Yeh none of that is free. Water is provided for by municipalities, which is paid for by city taxes like property tax and business licenses. Food stamps are paid for by federal taxes, and state programs are paid by state taxes. Air isn't controlled or regulated, and it would be impossible to do so, I'm confused why you included that.

If you are advocating for collectivism in healthcare, thats one thing. It's accomplishable through vast reform and increasing taxes heavily. However collectivism in housing is another story. Unless you are willing to restrict freedom of movement, freedom of Association, as well as completely destroy the American economy, you cant provide socialized housing for everybody. Its a childish dream that would likely lead to authoritarian states in order to provide an extremely small percentage of the population housing.

>No one is saying things should cost money. What they're saying is that the government should be footing the bill instead if spending trillions on the military. Also, taxing the *fuck* out of the upper class would go a long way towards paying for those services. 

Military spending is around 3-4% of GDP. Being a member of NATO means you have to spend minimum 2% on military.  Healthcare spending is about 7-9% of the GDP. Socialized healthcare would likely at least double or triple costs until the market had time to respond. 

All these people constantly asking for ""tax the rich"". Would it surprise you that the upper class already pays more than 50% of current taxes? I'm all for increasing tax burdens on billionaires, but I would like defined terms first. What constitutes rich? Top 5%? Top 10%? Or Top 1%? I've heard chap trap house retards call for death of people like my uncle who grinded his whole life to buy an apartment building to rent out for a fair price.   

>Right now the ""right"" of someone being obscenely wealthy is more protected than the right to shelter or healthcare, and that's pretty unacceptable imo.

Let's define necessary. Is an AR15 necessary to survive in a modern society? Mostly no, unless you live in extreme high crime areas. However we generally don't define living in a free state as only allowing the necessary. Otherwise we wouldn't allow smoking, fast vehicles, alcohol, fast food etc that all cause exponentially more deaths than guns do. A free society is about weighing your options and making value judgements based on that. 

If you meant that an AR15 isn't necessary as in it has no purpose, then you would be hilariously wrong. AR15s have numerous purposes, several of which they are probably the best option.


1. Sport Shooting. 3 Gun is a pretty large sport, with millions of participants worldwide. The AR or a rifle similar to it is necessary in order to compete. 

2. Hunting. The AR15 is the most popular hunting rifle in america by far, as it's light, durable, great for both medium sized game and varmints. The modularity of an AR15 makes it easy to adapt to any hunting task. I would hunt with an AR15 if I didn't already have a rifle i use.

3. Home defense. The AR 15 is the single most effective firearm to use in a home invasion type scenario. The rounds tend not to overpenetrate drywall, there is a solid mag capacity in case you miss, and you can easily attach lights to an ar15. Pistols require too much training, shotguns are too heavy and long, and both of them tend to overpenetrate drywall

4. Tyranny. Whether or not you agree with the existence of the second amendment, it cant really be argued that an intermediate caliber, modular rifle is the best for fighting against government over reach. The AR15 is the best of these options.

So there's clearly reasons to own one, whether or not you have a reason to. As to the cost/benefit, firearms can be beneficial to society, and the data is not conclusive. While Gun deaths are high in the US, most of that is suicide and gang shootings. Gun control has little affect on either of those. The remainder of deaths are tragic yes, but compared to the amount of times guns save people (the CDC found anywhere between 500k and 3.5 million times a year), then the data shows that guns have a net positive benefit.

Not that I expect you to change your mind. Most people are stubborn and refuse to admit they are wrong even in the face of data. For your information, im not even American. I live in one of those countries that you and other ignorant posters fetishize as being so much better than the US, and guess what? We have a ton of guns and very little gun crime. The Gun control that we do have has had little to no statistical affect on violent crime. It's almost as if violent crime is a social and cultural issue rather than blaming tools. The US has high gun crime due to high inequality."

Constitutionally:

1. The concept of repeating firearms existed prior to the constitution. Some of the founding fathers owned some. They didnt explicitly limit what you could own, in fact they did the opposite with (shall not be infringed). 

2. When you actually analyze the language used in the constitution, its two very clear parts. Both the ability to form and maintain a militia, as well as the right for the individual to arm themselves. Militias were expected to keep similar quality arms as the army. Hell private citizens even owned and operated warships after the constitution. If we were to follow the constitution to the letter, there would be no NFA, and artillery/missiles would be permissable to citizens



Historically: 

1. Its impossible to say what an American insurrection would look like, but purely based off of previous conflicts: Americas armed forces are easily the strongest in the world, ans have been since WW2. Despite this fact, they have lost several conflicts due to a multitude of reasons. The most famous is that America does not do well fighting asymettric warfare. Where as other countries generally have no qualms violently quashing rebellions, and care little about collateral damage, the US is a highly liberalized society where the welfare of both it's troops and world citizens is paramount. The US lost Vietnam/Afghanistan/Korea/Iraq as they were unable to conduct a traditional campaign against a state, and did not have the political appetite for unrestricted guerilla warfare. Its extremely naiive to think that if the US was unable to win an asymmetric war against foreign nations, that they would be willing to do the same to their own people. Any sort of unrestricted warfare against anybody, never mind American citizens is going to require a vastly different reality with both our military and society as a whole. Hence the whole ""what is your ar15 going to do against drones in the sky"" is a shit argument, because it doesn't really reflect the truths of modem conflicts. 


2. Even if it was lets say the entire Amwrican military vs even 10% of American gun owners, that's an incredibly difficult fight even with drones, tanks, cruise missiles etc. Theres approximately 110m gun owners in the US. 10% would be 11 million armed combatants. With roughly 1m combat troops in the US, that would be a 10 to 1 advantage. Going even further,  the majority of American troops are deployed around the globe. Now take into account the insurrection would have essentially open access to the homes and families of the other side, I dont see that as a winning fight.


3. At any point where the US government starts openly bombing it's own citizens, that is when it has failed as a state. Its not realistic, and doesn't really capture what would likely happen.


In reality tyranny is a slower process. Its preceded by decades of erosion of freedoms, fear mongering, jingoism, etc. Its absolutely mind boggling to me that Americans would willingly take a giant step towards tyranny by disarming themselves"
