nhl,ffjyj4v,t3_eu1i58,1580010477.0,Whats so bad about it? It makes it easier to see where the puck is. Thats one thing that makes hockey tough to watch sometimes. I sometimes lose track of where the puck is and who has it in other games.
nhl,ffiyl84,t1_ffhk59y,1579985909.0,"It would probably be tough, but doable."
nhl,ffh8jwd,t1_ffh7twf,1579926187.0,It didn't count because the puck has to go *in* the net. you can see on the replay that the puck hooked around and bounced off the wall they had there and landed on the net.
nhl,ffh7j77,t3_etlsps,1579925321.0,"It was an interesting idea but the scoring didn't make sense and they messed up with how that 10 point net is and that you can shoot over the net and it looks like its in the net but its really on top of the net. Also, it doesn't make sense to me that the highest scoring target is in the center of the ice, and the targets beyond that are lower scoring. The biggest, and tallest target is also worth the most points? That doesn't make sense!. It was cool to see them shoot the puck so far in the air tho."
nhl,ffh6b1l,t3_etloxk,1579924307.0,Umm maybe thats because they are the hosting city?? Just a wild theory there.
nhl,ffh55zd,t3_etlfut,1579923406.0,So you are saying that wasn't his real score?
nhl,ffh4wzd,t3_etl4ib,1579923211.0,"If they had it on my channel, I didn't notice it. But the glowing boards was distracting tho."
nhl,ffh49cj,t3_etl45d,1579922699.0,"It was a distraction for me. I watched it more than I watched the hockey action. I was trying to figure out if it was a tv effect or really on there in real life. Then I did realize it was on tv and I was surprised! It wasn't jittery when they moved the camera, it didn't cover up anyone or get mixed up, so they did a great job with the effect, it just distracted me because it was new and bright."

Nationals,ff8i1mi,t1_ff68o4l,1579679425.0,And the other no hitter was only a no hitter because of a fielding error. He personally made no mistakes in that one either. Plus he had a 1-hitter the week before the no-hitter against the Pirates that was incredibly dominate too! He is a sure-fire hall of famer and will be the first player inducted with a Washington Nationals hat on!

interestingasfuck,feubgck,t1_fet38zu,1579384947.0,Maybe so but the problem is the bear or cheetah would probably catch you and maul you before you had a chance to outlast it. Especially a cheetah because he would probably do something dirty to stop you (because he is a cheetah.... a cheater.... lol)

caps,fetzyev,t3_eqlzy2,1579381742.0,"I know we are talkin about this great game and how amazing Ove is, and he is, of course, but I googled trying to do research on the most consecutive hat tricks, and I saw that Wayne Gretzky scored 10 hat tricks in two consecutive seasons. Ove has had 26 hat tricks in his whole career. Gretzky had almost that many in 2 seasons!! That's amazing! And Gretzky had 92 and 87 goals in those two seasons. Plus, he had back to back hat tricks, but he had 4 goals in one and 5 goals in the other. That's just insane!! How does that even happen? I'm a noob in hockey, so forgive me if this is well known, and you all are like duh! But this just blew me away. I've known about Gretzky long before I started closely following hockey, of course, but I didn't know he did that."

Their fur acts kinda like their whiskers do in telling them how much room they have around them to move. They are used to being naked, of course, so when they have clothes on, their fur is detecting that they are trapped in a tight spot and they kinda think they can't move even if they tried but they don't really see anything trapping them so their lil kitty brains kinda glitches out and they freeze up."

I'd like to know how we overcame that. I guess frequent sign changing and stuff. We have very smart guys on our team. Stras was the victim of more traditional sign stealing by the Dodgers and he overcame that.
