netflix,ffcoalp,t1_ffcny36,1579803706.0,"I see. I got a bit further from that part, but it was totally disjointed. Writing style should have been more alluding or backed with foreshadowing."
netflix,ffcnlbh,t1_ffcnjfi,1579803271.0,"Yeah the dude was just weird. I am New Englander and it felt weird to hear such words.

I tried to figure out does he mean we don't serve Rich folk? It just felt out of place. Like it's also a gas station do people not know how to serve themselves at a gas station? Like why the immediate hang up? What significant purpose does this have to the narrative?"
netflix,ffcn4z0,t1_ffbxlf9,1579802989.0,"Kind of also felt it was poorly written. Like the New Englanders saying, ""We don't serve your kind."",  felt extraordinarily out of character for that region of the United States. It's just not something you see. NE is considered extremely woke especially anyone in their 45-55 range of age. 

I just felt like the writer has never traveled before to see the different cultural behaviors and social norms."
netflix,ffcmtu8,t3_esqo7b,1579802801.0,I couldn't make it past the first 5 mins. It was too stale for me.
netflix,ffarze2,t3_esh438,1579743112.0,Netflix rotates it library due to licensing agreements.
funny,ffahfty,t1_ff9mcjw,1579735818.0,The best substitute for plastic straws are ones made from dried wheat. They are both biodegradable and not likely to immediately turn to mush.

funny,ffa0cx2,t1_ff9sb7v,1579725327.0,Told you I have that bias. Drugs typically make you feel colder. There is logic to this. I live somewhere where it's 22 to 32 Celsius all the time. If I see a dirty winter parka on someone in the middle of summer. That person is on drugs and what ever you say about it I won't believe. That is my bias.
funny,ff9p3fc,t1_ff9g4g3,1579717733.0,There is general bias. It's often confused with racism or people will we use the race defense because it's easier to point. Clothes that are baggy on someone in the middle of the warm heat always has me on edge because those peeps have been doing drugs. Violence and mental issues are common in with druggies.
pcmasterrace,ff7pcqk,t1_ff7mkyx,1579655085.0,"You have two sets of reaction times. Hand movement is often related to muscle memory and doesn't always align with a person's eye reaction time.  The brain has to process the information to trigger muscle memory. And so you have one reaction dependent on the other. It's why often pro players will shoot around blind corners because the reaction time of your hands are typically faster when relying on muscle memory. 

The time to do this is definitely much slower than what you see. I read an optometrist's response to a similar question a while back where he said you can see 1000 frames but your brain only process 150 of them at a moment. 

So if you can have a 128 rate tick server it's likely your reaction time is falling much lower there than that. I would say it's probably noticable between the ranges of 20-90 ticks a second but it's entirely a rough guess. I am also sure a high pinnacle of pro-ness can do anything up to 128."
