Hmmm why could that be where is the correlation"
LateStageCapitalism,ffqdr4n,t1_ffqcdep,1580131503.0,"They asked you if you want to talk about lynching and you’re bringing up immigrants.

Did black people immigrate here, Mr. racist as fuck?

No, but whites did and committed genocide.

This isn’t your land; unlike Iceland fuckwad."
LateStageCapitalism,ffqdi30,t1_ffq1jgn,1580131272.0,"Yeah, they just directly cause it’s ridiculous price by having government backed student loans. Normally a lender has to asses whether or not a person has the means to pay back the loan. That’s the risk in lending. There is no risk in student lending, you can’t get out of that loan at all with a few exceptions."
LateStageCapitalism,ffqd4bo,t1_ffpyqyr,1580130909.0,You’re indirectly contributing to the killing either way.
LateStageCapitalism,ffqd2lt,t1_ffq875y,1580130861.0,8k x 4 = 32k. How bad is it when 32k is considered not much?
todayilearned,ffpg76w,t1_ffpejzx,1580094258.0,Yeah completely ignore population and bring up physical size like that means any fucking thing.
lostgeneration,ffm8zl4,t1_ffjuuqx,1580050661.0,If you had any understanding of economics you would know that her school has nothing to do with it. Her degree has nothing to do with it. Schools are not anti capitalism schools are making billions of dollars off of every graduating class because of it.
lostgeneration,ffm81ls,t1_ffjvb5f,1580050143.0,"Someone going through a tough situation is not a knock against them, which is what you’re implying.

You’re implying that someone with a degree shouldn’t ever work a “regular job” because of some type of notion they should automatically have a prestigious life on virtue of having a degree? Real life doesn’t work like that.

Nevermind the degrees at all, someone being a bartender or shoveling shit isn’t something funny or to knock them or that takes away anything from their character. You don’t get it."
LateStageCapitalism,ffkcdx3,t1_ffk5a6f,1580020465.0,"I’m not answering your question directly but off the top of my head I know a couple big things are he started the income tax, and it’s said that he gave America over to the oligarchs.... Chase, Carnegie, Colgate, Rockefeller, etc. the robber barons that still exist now."

news,ffik4r1,t1_ffiiic9,1579975789.0,That’s a violation of several of your rights in the Constitutional bill of rights. And several states ban automatic policing like traffic cameras under the principle of the right to face your accuser.
worldnews,ffij9ve,t1_ffiikfh,1579975200.0,Yeah. US is fucked.
toptalent,ffi7eb6,t1_ffi4x60,1579967037.0,"No, but in Illinois they have a state, city and just applied a freaking county tax to it too. Peoples receipts for $250 have like $75 of straight taxes. Of course it’ll improve over time as supply increases but those taxes aren’t changing."
LateStageCapitalism,ffgqfb8,t1_ffgpg3x,1579912428.0,Yeah I know better I normally wouldn’t do that. No surprise that my post is -20 but ultimately it worked out in this situation as far as the correct information being disseminated.
LateStageCapitalism,ffgm33a,t1_ffgg21x,1579909397.0,Oh good to know I need to do some research on it it’s just something I heard from a few people
LateStageCapitalism,ffgf7cb,t1_ffgdayw,1579904883.0,Bit off topic but I was all for eating plant based meat until I heard about all the harsh chemicals they are using to make it taste like meat and that one impossible patty has more estrogen in it than a women’s body produces in a year.

If not then sugar is what’s delicious, not coffee.

DebateCommunism,ffe16xb,t1_ffcl34s,1579834041.0,Huey Newton was riddled with bullets while asleep in bed with his wife by the POLICE because he was such an effective leader who brought together the working class of all races.
Socialism_101,ffe0uot,t1_ffclvjo,1579833792.0,Pick your battles. I’d die on that hill. Seeing someone who is 30 minutes late is completely absurd.
BreadTube,ffdv7ez,t1_ffdrkz2,1579829747.0,"Online distrust of police is stringent because we’re raised and taught the exact opposite. All throughout school you’re taught police are there to help you, which is false. Police are state actors - any judge will tell you that - they are legally allowed to lie to you and the main function of police is maintaining the status quo. A vast majority of bad publicity that police get are situations where they are prioritizating and violently protecting property at the cost of human life. Police will kill you - end your life - to recover property that is insured. So how can you be anti-capitalism and pro police? It makes absolutely no sense. Your Miranda rights clearly say “you have the right to remain silent, anything you say **can and will** be used against you in a court of law” there is no ambiguity."
ABoringDystopia,ffb9ika,t1_ffb9fev,1579756187.0,Yeah exactly.
ABoringDystopia,ffb8us2,t1_ffb8p8h,1579755428.0,"No he’s never been a republican in his life. He likes what Bernie stands for but he says he’ll never win in the U.S., electability etc. Worth noting that he accurately called the Trump win way ahead of time.

chicago_illinois,ffb4fkj,t1_ffb36nu,1579751522.0,It cost over $400 for registration and plates for 15+ year old used cars in Illinois now. $151 plate stickers a 50% increase from last year. Chicago city stickers. County and state tax on marijuana. $250 weed receipts have over $70 in taxes alone.  10% sales tax. Gas tax. Bag tax. Red lights cameras with a half second long yellow light. Speed cameras. Parking meters $8 an hour.
chicago_illinois,ffb1atc,t1_ffa2iq8,1579749319.0,"Using Munster as your example is honestly laughable. Munster is the most expensive city in NWI. An average working class person considering moving to Indiana isn’t considering a 210k house or a 450k house. I’m considering the move, Munster is nowhere near in my budget. Meanwhile in Merriville there’s houses sitting on an acre of land with taxes below a grand.

If a person has the means to afford a god damn half a million dollar house then I guess the taxes don’t matter, what else is new? Meanwhile there’s houses in the 150k~ range in Illinois that are taxed at the same total amount or more than your example."
