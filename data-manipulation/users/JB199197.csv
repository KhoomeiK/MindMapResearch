OutOfTheLoop,fffuwax,t1_fffnf49,1579892320.0,"I know for a fact that you haven't watched any of those podcasts.  I know for a fact that you have never listened to any of those people actually talk.  I know this because none of those people are racist.  None of them are anti-Semitic.  One of them is an actual Jew.  So yeah, you think anyone who isn't a progressive is a Nazi.  Which in my opinion just completely discredits anything you have to say."
OutOfTheLoop,fffmxza,t1_ffflewh,1579887423.0,"Dude, when has he ever had a ""neo-nazi"" on the show.  You haven't ever actually watched the show.  I know this because anyone who has knows that what you're saying is bullshit.  Why are you so afraid of people having discussions?  Why can't we listen to people with different views.  What you call a ""neo-nazi"" is most likely just someone on the right end of the spectrum.  If what these people are saying sways people to think differently it's most likely because it makes sense.  You want people to make decisions and vote based on ignorance.  You don't want them to hear someone from the right speak because you are afraid it will make sense to them.  They might even realize that what people like you call nazi's, has nothing to do with actual racism at all."
TrueOffMyChest,ff7a5mw,t3_eryzzg,1579644372.0,"I have the same problem.  I'm 28 and I can honestly say I finally look like I'm about 19.  The most annoying part is when other dudes try to punk you.  Like they talk down to you.  Do you work out?  I know it sounds cliche but having a mans body really helps in our scenario.  Especially if you are having trouble getting girls.  You can find a girl that also looks young for her age.  To be honest though, you probably pay more attention to it than anyone else.  You are paying attention to all the people that are looking for any excuse to look down at someone.  I agree, it is annoying when someone mistakes you for a young kid.  And you're like mother fucker I'm out here living life just like you, my mommy isn't fucking tucking me in at night anymore.  So, in conclusion, put on about 20 pounds of muscle if you can and you will notice things change.  You will put on weight in your face also and that will help."
TrueOffMyChest,ff63dlc,t3_eru77q,1579618122.0,Sometimes I spit in my dreams and I wake up mid spit.  But it's never like a full on spit.  It's like a weak ptuy.  And it just goes right on my face.
TrueOffMyChest,ff60k8m,t1_ff5s0pq,1579616019.0,It's almost certainly too much porn.  Low t is uncommon when you are in your 20s
TwoXChromosomes,ff4m888,t3_eri6ob,1579567010.0,Kind of off topic but why the fuck would you ask children for naked photos on facebook or something like that?  How do these people sleep at night without constantly worrying that they will be caught.  It's like the people that murder someone and then post themselves standing at the crime scene with the murder weapon on facebook live and then have the audacity to be surprised that they got caught.  Like why would you knowingly put evidence of you being a fucking weirdo on the fucking internet?
TrueOffMyChest,ff41btz,t3_erfsal,1579553391.0,"I believe that any time you give one group of people power over another group of people it is inevitable for group a to abuse that power.  Even in the states I think that some serious reforms need to take place. 

 I think the way that the left and antifa goes about it is seriously wrong though.  And I feel like the right just tries to act like nothing is wrong when it is super clear that there are corrupt officers violating rights of U.S citizens.  And they do this because they no that they will get away with it.  Some officers walk around with thousands of complaints made against them yet nothing ever happens.

  We pay these people to protect and serve and instead they harass us and we (the people who pay their salaries) are powerless to do anything besides make a complaint and be threatened while doing so. 

  I can't imagine the injustices that go on in China.  I believe everything they say about their police abusing citizens."
TrueOffMyChest,ff1a8ms,t3_er3gnf,1579476791.0,"It always baffles me how spoiled some people really are.  The worst is when you are in the same party of someone who is giving a waiter a hard time or something.  I value my time in those positions because you really get a good understanding of how shitty some people can really be.  When people think that you are beneath them, the way they treat you says a lot about their personality."
TrueOffMyChest,ff0xf7c,t3_eqwez3,1579473244.0,Is this really even a thing to post here?  Is that even frowned upon it controversial in any way?
TrueOffMyChest,feuyji1,t3_eqo96y,1579391205.0,Go seek professional help.  You won't be outed unless you plan on hurting someone.  Nobody here is qualified to deal with this.  Go seek professional help before you destroy someone else's life or your own.  You will have Dr. patient confidentiality.  Don't talk to someone from the school.  Find your own Dr. and make sure you go over the rules of disclosure before you talk to anyone if that makes you feel better.
TrueOffMyChest,feuxei5,t3_eqgl9u,1579390923.0,There's a good chance that in your lifetime you will see a solution to your problem.
TrueOffMyChest,feuwnjp,t1_festx3v,1579390682.0,They don't always bully for amusement.  Young kids who experience pain and suffering usually turn there pain towards others simply because they don't know any better and they don't know what else to do with that pain.  A lot of kids end up regretting their actions and feeling even worse because of it.  Bottom line is nobody is winning when it comes to bullying.  Its a similar thing with little kids torturing animals.  Most of them feel deep shame and regret from it.  Being young and experiencing fear and a lack of control in such extreme ways without having any developed coping mechanisms to deal with it wouldn't be fun for anyone.  That fear gets so pent up and it unfortunately comes out in terrible ways.  It's not right for kids to bully.  However it isn't as simple as saying he's a bully so he is bad.  A lot of times these kids are getting bullied themselves by their parents or older siblings.
TrueOffMyChest,fepcm16,t3_epuk11,1579317227.0,It's terrible that she thinks of children as if they are some type of accessory.  People should only have children if they know they will be able to provide them with the best possible environment.
TrueOffMyChest,feky2bi,t3_eppd9e,1579209977.0,"Bro your 21.  Most people aren't going to be famous.  You need to change your idea of success.  Not everyone gets to be rich.  If you are able to take pride in maybe even holding a job you might be able to build your confidence and move up in the world.  You're 21, you have no idea where you will be in 10 years.  Trust me.  

edit: go watch fight club.  A lot of what that movie is about will ring home for you. I just thought of that."
TrueOffMyChest,fekxmhc,t1_fekstkf,1579209715.0,"Maybe you can't directly fire someone because of who they support politically.  However, you can have that person harassed until they have no choice and are forced to quit themselves which can even be worse in terms of claiming unemployment or getting a severance package etc.

It has become acceptable to physically assault people in certain areas for wearing a MAGA hat.  Despite the fact that it has been proven over and over that being a trump supporter and let's say being a racist or misogynist are completely seperate things.  Also, being left on the political spectrum does not automatically exclude you from being those things either.  Yet some people are attacked and ""outed"" as racists just because they support the president.

I have seen countless videos online of people getting jumped while everyone simply stands there doing nothing about it acting like the person deserved it.  I'm almost positive someone is going to comment that they did deserve it on this post."
offmychest,fehtbjh,t1_fehjo1y,1579123454.0,"Whenever you even think about bringing something up will your mom start crying and say "" I was a good mother.""  Because that's what my mom does lol.  And she was a straight up bully in ways I didn't understand until I was older.  She will just casually avoid admitting to anything though.  She was a single mother so I try to be understanding but then there are things like her blaming me for her boyfriend breaking up with her.  That is just something I would never even think about saying to a child, nor would I be so stupid to think a child could ever be the cause of my failures like that."
funny,fehsojk,t1_fehpz4l,1579123096.0,They have a specific order in which they will try to swindle you.  Like they will start with the story about how they need money to pick up their kids and if you say no they go down the list until they eventually ask you for like a cigarette or something.
offmychest,fehs3ny,t3_ep5d4a,1579122769.0,I hope you didn't sign the papers.   The way paul/paula went about it and the person he hired whoever that was sound like pieces of shit.
TrueOffMyChest,fed9b6t,t3_eochg9,1579004484.0,"I think the voting system is flawed.  Instead of seeing how many people vote each way we only see the outcome.  So you post an opinion, 60 pepper disagree, 50 people agree and you never share that opinion again.  Also I cant stand when you post something that really isn't that controversial but you can tell people get upset so they just down vote you to hell.  It doesn't really matter, it isn't worth anything, but it just helps endorse infirce a very one sided, Echo chamber.  It really isn't a good website for discussing anything.  But people on this website act like they are so open minded.  And everyone has the same god damn humor.  The make the same fucking jokes over and over.  I don't really like this website when I really think about it."
TrueOffMyChest,fdzxf4l,t3_enamd5,1578798142.0,"Every time a see a white guy with a black girl I scream at the top of my lungs ""damnnn he must have a huge dick."""
TrueOffMyChest,fdxt7a8,t3_en9icv,1578772653.0,"Some people use other people to feel better about themselves.  They put you in a box and as soon as you try to get out of it, they will try to take you down and put you back inside of it.  As I get older I find these people are so much easier to spot and I just avoid them at all costs.  Friends should want you to be the best you can be.  

And I'm sorry, but being skinny(not unhealthy skinny) or healthy is good for you.  It's good for your self esteem and it is good when people try to be the best version of themselves because it demonstrates to other people that you are confident and you want the best out of life.  I have been overweight before and people sometimes don't realize how it can be so detrimental to your happiness.  How you can be so unhappy with the way you look but the only comfort you can find is eating more.  Like in Austin powers it really can be a vicious cycle lol.  

Good for you for trying to make a positive change in your life.  Those other people don't even realize that their toxic attitude towards other is most likely their main problem in life, not their weight."
