I find, in reference to these things, it helps to be more stern than accepting of defeat. If you want to make the change happen, you can. Everyone can become more this or more that. Use yourself as a benchmarker for your results and not others.

Monitoring your progress helps to remind you about what you've undergone. 

Walking always burns calories. 

Carbonated water (no sugars or additives) may help you quell hunger pangs while you're adjusting.

When it comes to this sort of stuff, though, I find the internal perception is really the driver for the rest of it. Your words may hold you back as much as any condition. If you are serious about adjusting your body, make it more present in your conscious awareness and focus. If you're constantly discouraging, comparing, defeatist, quit, or avoid, then you will continually struggle to overcome your difficulties.


Higher reps equaling cardio is common knowledge among those who commit to exercising with weights. I'm going to assume you haven't done very much research. Its well understood that more movement=cardio=fat burning. 

What we input and allow to swim around inside our minds dictates who we are and what we do. If you focus on why you can't, this will reflect in your choices and actions. It only takes a bit of confidence in achievement to have belief. I would suggest you find online communities that share ideas, accomplishments, support, and that generally keep the idea of the body as a temple to love and take care of. Find YouTubers similar to you undergoing a journey. Maybe start a YouTube for people like you out there who could use support and strength, it would also keep you accountable. 

You don't have to go all out if it means you are going to avoid doing it. A snowball needs momentum. Maintain consistency and take the steps you're comfortable with. 

Input and consistency. This will, with absolutely no shred of doubt, draw you closer to accomplishing what you set out for."
memes,ffikq6s,t1_ffik8b7,1579976204.0,"Calories in vs calories out doesn't require you to take on Herculean feats. You can pace out your exercising. Higher repetitions with lower weights is also a form of cardio that isn't taxing on the lungs

Your choice words are a bit telling. I understand the hunger, but if you are constantly telling yourself you are undergoing literal starvation, you're attaching enough negative connotation to collapse your efforts. Consider the internal dialogue you use and how it may reflect your choices and perceptions. Humans evolved in a climate of food scarcity. Bodies adjust to dietary changes. You feel starved because limiting calories means your body is using stored fat to fuel itself."
memes,ffik8br,t1_ffie7tx,1579975858.0,"Conditioning. Your brains sending you positive feedback on food. You can balance that out with consistently validating yourself of your efforts exercising and the results you get. Don't need to shit on yourself when doing the ""wrong"" thing, just continuously validate yourself for doing the right thing. Slowly but surely you change the programming.

The conditioning is pretty powerful though. Addiction is like a weasel that will justify itself at every turn, making people accept that they can't overcome it simply because its easier than the hill they have to climb to overcome it. You could do it, but I'm assuming your brains already finding ways to say you can't. Very disempowering.

Also social anxiety is something I struggled with. Basically just my body and brain telling me ""I'm not comfortable here"". Instead of avoiding that anxiety, I faced it. I changed my perception, understood other people's conditioned views, how they're entitled to them, and their perception doesn't necessarily determine who I am unless I'm actively trying to impress them. I'm just existing. From there its just repetition again, conditioning. I kept socializing until I could socialize. I said a ton of dumb and uncomfortable stuff that caused my nervous system to send me shocks of anxiety. Eventually learned more of the language of the people i was communicating with. Comedy, wit, listening, responding, flirting, whatever. 

After you desensitized yourself to the stress and the fear, you become more immune and able to handle more of it.

I'm sorry but if you sit back on excuses you will -always- be this way. These are tools of avoidance, not solutions.

I sympathize with you and try my best to understand the experience of you or others before I turn to speaking on what to do.

philosophy,ffgk09m,t1_fffzdgj,1579908000.0,"Part of that takes defining better. ""Better"" is a subjective thing lol. The experience of life is relative. Life sort of places us into binary situations. Things like powerful laws with equal weight will rub up on each other, and one must get chosen over the other. Same goes for values.

There are many desires. Some become more forward than others. Some become more forward because of behavioral and physical addiction. I might have a craving for McDonalds, but I also want to lose weight or feel healthy. Or even aside that, I satisfy the craving and now I physically feel like shit. How are we defining better in this case?

This is maybe outside the framework you've posited, but the Buddhists remove desire from their lives and operate in a matter of just experience. ""Being"" as opposed to ""doing"", experiencing over chasing after goals. Humans are aware of (what can be perceived as) the problematic nature of desire and addiction, and utilize certain methods to give themselves more self control so that desires and addictions aren't always at the wheel. Monks, meditation/vipassana, self control, dissociations and ego deaths etc. This can offer them space for new direction.

I know it's pedantic, but it's hard to answer your question with certain words like ""ever"" and ""objectively better"". Does satisfying a desire *ever* make things better? Yeah I'll go out on a limb and say thats been the case for many people, but it doesn't account for them all."

""That physical reality may potentially not exist if we were unable to perceive it?"" That's one school of thought, yes. Again, we don't know. Conscious examination is an experiencer. Just making up an example, perhaps the universe was conjured for the intent of experience. There's also the simulation theory, that we're essentially being data harvested. 

To me, until all is known, these are only different ways to look at the same thing for our own usage that allows us to go through life with a certain perception as a means to discover, experience, and manipulate our sandbox.

We don't know, and that's the point that's made against absolution. One reason I can think of, in terms of how that relates to us and societies, is that if we're taught there's objective truth, and that someone can make an empirical claim about objective truth, then they control direction absolutely. Our science and our material feats of engineering give us a lot of belief because we see and experience them, which is part of the tree that inclines us to accept material absolution. 

Our mathematics don't have absolutes. Our physics break down in black holes. The quantum realm is completely surreal to our fundamental understandings thus far. We don't know if our constants are constant. We are grabbing a still frame from of our current space and time through our own biological composition and our state of perception. So to me, we pick a truth to roll with that houses ideology for belief, and walk the path that this avenue of belief takes us down for exploration purposes.

In the acknowledgement of our innate biases, we have a freedom to choose another path. You can take that about as far as you want, because the body has certain tastes and preferences.

My thoughts

The truth (depending on definition) is either none of our perceptions, or all of them through a collection of individual experiences. It's the only measure we currently have to base reality off of.

I see this problem of defining absolution in a still frame of time through our developed senses. I don't know of anything we can empirically claim as absolute, but just something we're currently experiencing. It's just a pattern of thought to roll with or not to house different ambitions and perceptions. That, to me, is what philosophy is supposed to be about, and I'm somewhat frustrated that its been convoluted into a bunch of linguistic games and people trying to prove this way over that. There's no inherent pattern in the stars, but we project them to house a way of being, and utilize that belief as a means to explore this thing we're taking part in.

I don't want to say these thought experiments within philosophy are pedantic and meaningless, all explorations have their own merits. What bothers me is that I feel we've lost sight that they are mere ways of looking at the same thing that give us the liberation to choose what paths we intend to follow, and has instead become a bit masturbatory in engaging in who is right. We pull a bunch of patterns that sound right until we have enough of a web for belief, then we use that web to guide our action."

This is completely false. Again, I take external narrative with a grain of salt. 

When I visited in 2016, Castro was opening up with personal computers. I was outside a University in Havanna and saw some people with laptops. Many people have phones. There is access to internet.

Keep in mind that China also controls their internet. Countries do this so there's less exposure to other indoctrinating propaganda. One thing the states is supremely effective at is spinning narrative, so I'm really not surprised that a country like Cuba would put boarders on access to information as a means to contain their cultural perspective. 

Their food IS really good food. Literally all fresh non-GMO all organic food.

Cuba has always been renowned for its medical competency. 


What Cuba is doing is uplifting the whole. That means fanning out wealth and distributing it among the people. Aiming for luxury is not a wrong or immoral pursuit, but I think if so many people are living lavish while we still have a lot of people struggling to get an education, have affordable health care, along with a ton of housing speculation, then personally, I think our priorities need consideration."

Did you read your article before you linked it?

""Even factoring in its low GDP per capita, the Human Development Index (HDI) lists Cuba in the “high human development” category; it excels not just in health and education, but also in women’s participation and political inclusion. Cuba has eliminated child malnutrition. No children sleep on the streets. In fact, there is no homelessness. Even during the hungry years of economic crisis of the 1990s, Cubans did not starve. Cuba stuck with the planned economy and it enabled them to ration their scarce resources.

Yes, salaries are extremely low (as both Fidel and Raul have lamented) – but Cubans’ salaries do not determine their standard of living. About 85% of Cubans own their own homes and rent cannot exceed 4% of a tenant’s income. The state provides a (very) basic food basket while utility bills, transport and medicine costs are kept low. The opera, cinema, ballet and so on are cheap for all. High-quality education and healthcare are free. They are part of the material wealth of Cuba and should not be dismissed – as if individual consumption of consumer goods were the only measure of economic success.""

Kicking a drug habit under major stress when that drug is often an escape from stress (or trauma) is counterproductive while under the stress of being on the street. I would sincerely implore anyone to go live on the street for a week and just take note of how much stress your body feels and how that translates to your thoughts and emotions. If drugs are your escape, then it maintains the cycle. I don't disagree with pulling yourself up to an extent, but people are still humans at some point. Moving past hard addiction while on the street is evidently a superhuman feat, as it is rarely accomplished.

Moving from the streets into housing is not an immediate drug addiction solution, but it goes a long way to help the individual down a path where much of the exhaustion the streets causes is freed up, offering them potential space to face the struggle of breaking the addiction."

There's a faux economy of pressure setup whereby those on the bottom essentially -have- to accept something bare minimum at some point as a means to live, because of the increasing cost of living.

Much of the model we maintain is to constrict people into place while they are conditioned within it's framework that shapes how they come to see the world.
