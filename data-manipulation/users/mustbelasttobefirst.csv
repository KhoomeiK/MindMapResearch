DebateReligion,feqa7aq,t3_eqdmwi,1579339414.0,"My favourite bible phrase is ""Sorrow sobers the soul""  . To keep it short, when you suffer,you are not under the luxury of this sinful world.  You are forced to be righteous.  Its obvious that this world is corrupt,but the world doesnt see the big picture. When you suffer,you start seeing the bigger picture.

When i would read, the visions would change the words on me.  I was sent words like,""messiah,son of man,king of ages,good sheppard,son of man will jump 150 feet in the air,son of man must suffer"".  I never heard these words before and had to wrap my head around these words to figure out the message. 

One year i had a vision. I read some sentences, I didnt know what it meant.  A year later i started reading the bible and i realized i visionzed two bible verses.  

I heard that it is written in the quran that if God is talking to you,he will send you scripture.

The story of Job in the bible was about a righteous man who lost everything. I feel like job right now.  My life was worse 2 years ago,but i still have issues. I need to live a life like job.

Im realizing that my visions is leading up to an event. Has to do with the messiah."
DebateReligion,feq2307,t3_eqdmwi,1579336392.0,"I have had a personal experience. I did what you would say were hallulcinations, i tried to find a logical explanation to what was happening to me.  Took me years to accept the fact what i was getting was real,the visions of words.  I was getting words i never heard off,i would have to google it to find the meaning to these words.  I had a vision that the world was created almost 6000 years ago. Their is a biblical theory about this.  I have been getting them for 5 years.  

When it comes to religion.  I believe in God,left the church.  I read the torah,quran, and bible.  These books have wisdom,but have problems with them also.  Im on my own journey now. Its me and God only.

For truth. I have a shitty life, bunch of problems.  But i learned that only through suffering,do you learn the truth."

So bottom line, I left religion because religion promote a God that's is not the same God that it's written in the Books and these books are contaminated with lies.
