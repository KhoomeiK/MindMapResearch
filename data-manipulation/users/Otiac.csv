This benefits the world, it benefits the countries the US is competing against in these little studies. Other countries avoid the costly R&D that the US conducts, then they buy the resulting products further down the line once economies of scale have ramped up to make them more affordable. Other countries have a seemingly more cost-efficient health care system because they are not footing the bill for global medical advances like the US is.

2) Health care is not of a worse quality in the US than it is in Canada, Australia, and western Europe. Americans have the [highest survival rates from treatable diseases like cancer.](http://b-i.forbesimg.com/theapothecary/files/2011/11/CONCORD-table1.jpg), we consistently have the best specialist medical care in the world. Half of all medical patents *in the world* are filed in the US. People literally come from all over the world to seek treatment here, nobody goes to England, or France, or Denmark to get treatment. Five-year survival rates for breast cancer are higher in the United States than England, Denmark, Germany, and Spain, according to the American Cancer Society. In the United States, the survival rate for prostate cancer is 99.1 percent. In Denmark it's 47.7 percent. For kidney cancer patients, the survival rate here is 68.4 percent. It's just 45.6 percent in England -- which the Commonwealth Fund ranked as the number-one healthcare system in the world. Those numbers are *pathetic* for those systems, and damn if you want those numbers here too.

3) People wonder why the US spends more but less people are covered. Well, even [uninsured Americans](http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba596) receive wider and more timely screening, diagnosis, and treatment than Canadians, Australians and western Europeans. The US health care system is the most responsive in the world, even concerning uninsured people, and this makes it expensive.

4) Regarding infant mortality - actually learn what you're talking about. The United States typically places far down the list behind France, Greece, Italy, Hungary, even Cuba. This comparison is notoriously unreliable, because countries either use different definitions of a live birth -- or fudge their numbers. The United States, for example, counts every live birth in its infant mortality statistics. But France only includes babies born after 22 weeks of gestation. In Poland, a baby has to weigh more than 1 pound, 2 ounces to count as a live birth. The World Health Organization notes that it's common practice in several countries, including Belgium, France, and Spain, ""to register as live births only those infants who survived for a specified period beyond birth."" What's more, the United States has significantly more pre-term births than other countries. That fact alone accounts for ""much of the high infant mortality rate in the U.S.,"" according to a report from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db23.pdf). The CDC found that if the United States had the same pre-term birth rate as Sweden, our infant mortality rate would be cut nearly in half. We actually try to let the children live and save the child as opposed to just abort and forget. No thanks!

5) Treatment delays were so chronic in the United Kingdom, for example, that the government had to issue a formal requirement that patients shouldn't have to wait more than four months for treatments authorized by their general practitioner. The Royal College of Physicians found that poor care -- including doctors trying to keep costs down -- caused nearly two-thirds of asthma deaths in the U.K. in 2012. In Canada, the average patient seeking an elective medical service has to wait four-and-a-half months between being recommended for treatment by their primary care physician and actually receiving it.

Suuuuure. You're just...wrong about all of this, ignorant about all of it, and won't change your mind. Sorry, I'll keep by 99% survival rate for prostate cancer and other treatable disease, short wait times, and available care everywhere. You can have your 47% survival rate and wait two months to start the chemo."

Warhammer40k,ffmhtyo,t1_ffkqsr2,1580054855.0,"Primer helps the paint stick to the surface of the model and make it easier to coat/control. It's the first step in painting a model, as the bare plastic won't let the paint adhere to the surface well and doesn't allow for a very even finish. I'm a little surprised you didn't prime this model, it looks pretty good for that.

Depending on your model/army's base color is really what you prime with - for that one, for instance, Chaos Black is the obvious choice, then you go back over the primer with regular paint to give a nice, smooth finish. 

[Here](https://citadelcolour.com/playlist/6038888620001/6038126833001) is their tutorial on how to use them. It's just a balance of being far enough away from the model that the primer doesn't pool on it, losing you details, and being close enough that you can get a coat that's as thin as possible while covering the entire model's surface."
