pokemon,ffsgm22,t3_euo4lt,1580181220.0,Perfection. This is the style of pokemon I grew up with and will always remember.  You've captured it perfectly.
pokemon,ffsgh2r,t3_eurlxp,1580181124.0,"Ah yes, two of the most abundant and annoying pokemon from earlier gens. Gorgeous artwork."
omad,ffseb89,t3_euxbw6,1580179630.0,"When I'm hungry I just think about dinner and every minute that passes is one minute closer to eating!

I also like thinking about the empty feeling in my stomach. To me that feeling means thin, healthy, lightweight! These thoughts get me through my fast."
omad,ffr2t3a,t3_euj7zl,1580149221.0,"I eat during 5pm-6pm. It works well for me as I can look forward to a big meal and be satisfied throughout the night. 
If I were to eat in the morning or afternoon, now I don't have anything to look forward to and I'll most likely go to bed hungry.  It's easier to ignore the cravings for food if you know you can have a ton later in the day."
AskReddit,ffon85q,t3_eu6iol,1580079460.0,"I've looked up boxers before (the dog breed) and was shown images of actual boxers with gloves on, guys wearing all kinds of underwear, and eventually gigantic dongs."
aww,ffoler8,t1_ffmrje8,1580078900.0,"Perfect size (not big not small), short fur, fearsome looking yet adorable and playful, extremely loyal, resilient, etc. Perfect dog for those who don't want a large dog but don't want a small one. Intimidating towards strangers. Easy hygiene maintenance."
AskReddit,ffm9tbe,t1_ffkcm29,1580051032.0,"I'm not sure what changed.. I just started thinking that I couldn't give a fuck less what that person thinks, what she thinks, what he thinks. 

I'll dress how I want, say what I want, do what I want, all within reason of course. 

But if someone doesn't like it, they can go stick a fire poker up their ass. And that's been my attitude since... Having that attitude has helped me out tremendously."
AskReddit,ffkbozh,t1_ffir9by,1580020149.0,"I really feel this. I've been a coward most of my life.
It wasn't until these past 5 years that I really stopped giving a fuck and haven't laid down like a submissive little bitch anymore. It's a great feeling and I wish I would've done this earlier in my life."
AbruptChaos,ffkajnh,t1_ffiotmc,1580019629.0,True. The ancient fossil I live in was built in 1892. It has withstood many windy storms with no problems except for a leaking roof which has been replaced.
leaves,ffi6mge,t3_etpsup,1579966472.0,"I smoked off and on (mostly on) for almost 10 years.
After coming back from my last break, weed started making me experience the worst anxiety and panic attacks while high.

I stopped smoking for good a year ago, and I promise life is much better without it! Anxiety has gone way down and I do not have severe panic attacks anymore. You will not regret quitting."
leaves,ffi5rqg,t3_etq37f,1579965826.0,"I completely agree with you.
A year ago I had to stop smoking weed because I would experience the worst anxiety and panic attacks while high, along with pain.

The fact that I can't smoke it because of health problems really suck. I also feel like a relationship has ended, one that I didn't want to end. I feel like weed broke up with me lol.

I am also heartbroken that I can no longer enjoy a high and relax on the couch at night. I no longer have that excited feeling to come home & chill out with a bowl.

But there are definitely more upsides to not smoking vs smoking. It does get easier and feels amazing not having the weight of weed attached to you."
LifeProTips,ffha59x,t1_fff853c,1579927600.0,"Holy shit that's my name and I have the same issues. People will say ""hey lisa""  ""hey leah"" etc, and I whip my head to look at them only to find out they were not calling for me...."

velvethippos,ffduqdg,t3_esuo23,1579829407.0,"Adorable, never met a dog that doesn't love PB.
I feed my dogs pills in wet food and they love it.

Peanut powder is a great option. It isn't made with oil, you just mix it with water and it's amazing!"

AskReddit,ff9fzqp,t1_ff7ui5p,1579712205.0,"Agreed.
My bf's step mom never asks about me or my bf. She ONLY talks about her dead sons that died from drugs, and talks only about her kin. It's so rude. She has a one track mind and it's boring."
leaves,ff80m8g,t3_es1zhw,1579662891.0,"That's amazing!
It's been a year for me and I feel great. No weed has become the new normal for me. It's definitely easier to resist the urge! I've learned how to entertain myself without the use of it.

Have fun on your new journey being just ""you"" and not the intoxicated version."

 One day I decided to eat a bunch of food and had some later in the evening. I woke up in the middle of the night with the worst stomach pains and nausea I've ever felt. My stomach was super bloated and I thought I was going to burst open.

It's so crazy how your body adjusts to your new lifestyle. When you venture out of your normal food routine, good god does your body notice."

I've slowly gotten there, but the holidays came and I've gained 5 pounds and all I see in the mirror is my thighs  :/

When I hop on the scale every day and see the number is lower than yesterday, that right there is my motivation to keep going."
science,fepderu,t1_fepb2rd,1579317769.0,"I have to disagree. I believe long term use will have some sort of negative affect, such as memory loss, possible respiratory issues, and mental health problems like increased anxiety or depression. I know firsthand that weed can cause anxiety.

I do think that weed is the better choice out of drugs and alcohol, but only on occasion and not for every day use."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fen1d6c,t1_feluou4,1579274786.0,Came here looking for this comment
AskReddit,fel3p3r,t1_fej5w5o,1579213385.0,"Same! I had a cyst for months and it already hurt occasionally, but when it ruptured, it was the worst pain I've ever felt."
unpopularopinion,fel2s66,t1_fek1j0a,1579212817.0,"Thank you for the info! My pain came from an ovarian cyst. I would feel slight pain throughout my day, but when I smoked, it became unbearable. I couldn't move my torso in any direction without feeling extreme sharp pain.

I had just smoked one night when all of a sudden I was in immense pain and couldn't move. Went to the ER and found out it had ruptured.
 
Sometimes I wonder if it was going to rupture without weed, or if weed caused it to rupture.."
dogs,fekj0ty,t3_epjpxx,1579201059.0,"I do! I even walk my dogs every single day, no matter the weather or the time.

But for some reason I always feel bad leaving... My boy freaks out every time.

I also feel bad for leaving them home on a beautiful sunny day. I just feel guilty."
unpopularopinion,fejpwhf,t1_feizx86,1579182809.0,"Thank you! I miss it very much, but I have improved my life since quitting so I'll stay away from it.
I am also confused why people get offended when you share an experience that's different than theirs. I think they want to believe that there is absolutely nothing wrong with weed, and that you're doing it wrong. 

Congrats to you for quitting as well!"
unpopularopinion,fejpidy,t1_fejd7t8,1579182498.0,"I would also search symptoms while high and find that I had cancer and would die in 5 minutes.. Definitely added to the anxiety!

I'd experiment with weed and quit for a few months and see how your anxiety and pain levels are. I wouldn't even do edibles.. 

Since quitting, I no longer feel any type of internal pain :) It was so scary, being high and having a sharp pain in my stomach and get worse with every movement. I would try to get sober real quick! 

I do recommend CBD oil! Either by ingesting or vaping it. Personally, it gives me a calming effect just like weed, but without the high. No pains, no munchies, and if you feel anxious about anything, CBD helps take it away.

Good luck with everything!"
science,feiyo1z,t3_ep3gm3,1579150927.0,So is this a good or bad thing?
unpopularopinion,feiyauq,t1_feipac9,1579150613.0,"You sound exactly like me. Smoked that long over those ages every single night before bed.

I was overweight because of the munchies, woke up feeling groggy, couldn't focus on much and didn't have the best short term memory. 

I was addicted to it and got so angry when I ran out and couldn't find any to smoke.

The biggest reason why I quit for good a year ago is because weed started making me have panic attacks and severe anxiety. I swear it can make you feel internal pain more than you would sober."
science,feflulq,t1_feenh6a,1579059100.0,"I can't agree with you enough!
I've been an on and off weed smoker for several years. 

Finally, after coming back from an 8 month hiatus, I realized weed gives me panic attacks & severe anxiety while high. I can no longer smoke it unfortunately..

During my years of smoking, I was overweight due to munching everything in sight, had bad short term memory, and occasional anger outbursts. 
I was also addicted to it and got real angry when I ran out and couldn't find any to smoke.

It's a better alternative to drugs and alcohol for sure. But I agree that people out there make it seem like weed has absolutely no side effects when it definitely does.

I wish it was legalized all over, but hope people understand there ARE real, sometimes serious, side effects."
velvethippos,fef0gru,t3_eom0p4,1579045284.0,"I wish pitties would be bred more frequently with other breeds to create a smaller mini pit... if that's even possible?

dogs,fecf0yr,t3_eofekz,1578972359.0,"My 9 year old pit just started shaking out of nowhere, it's been off and on for four days now. He had been trembling/shaking horribly and it looked pretty serious..

Took him to the vet today and turns out he has a painful back/spine.

I'd take her to the vet just to make sure it isn't something serious! Sometimes problems go away on their own, but if your dog seems to be in pain, I'd take her."
aww,fea7x2i,t3_eo6njp,1578945408.0,Dog is not happy. Would not let the kids continue petting.
Awwducational,fe2w2ww,t3_endrki,1578843467.0,"I don't understand why anyone wants a docked tail. It looks silly and doesn't benefit the dog AT ALL. Maybe it was a benefit when dogs were working on the farm, but that's rare nowadays.

Not to mention, who doesn't want to see a tail wag when you come home? Seeing my dog wag his tail is one of the best things about being a dog parent."

It's ashame you'd rather use a man made product on your lady bits than coconut oil. I know you'll probably say coconut oil is also man made or whatever, but no matter what, it is more natural than lubricant. 

You should do more research on coconut oil because it seems you did a quick Google search and recited the first thing you read instead of finding informative articles.

I am done arguing with a stranger who hasn't even tried something they are so against Lol.
 Have a wonderful time frying your vag with artificial goo."

I say to everyone, use it and enjoy it. It's natural, tastes great, and not filled with chemicals. Don't knock something until you try it."

I just had chicken wings yesterday and they weighed 10.2 ounces. After I finished them I weighed the bones and they weighed 3 ounces, so I actually ate 7.2 ounces of chicken! 

I weigh everything and it's quite annoying at first but becomes routine and  normal after a while :)
