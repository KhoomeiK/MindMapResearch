With a credit card this doesn't matter, but with a debit card this could set aside a huge chunk of your available balance.   

I'd definitely recommend using a credit card for safety. And besides, you're throwing away money if you're not using one to earn airline or hotel points. Just use them like you'd use your debit card. Pay your entire balance every month and be smart."

AskReddit,fendie4,t1_fenbyfr,1579282359.0,"Fair enough. I actually ended up have a discussion with my wife about this.   


She had the same conclusion, but I pointed out that they could have tried to catch the ""killer"" at any point during the year. It's possible that the basilisk might appear on the map, but even if they didn't they could have seen Ginny out of bed in the corridor where the attack happened if they had looked.   

My wife said that they just used to check for teachers outside of secret passages.    

I'm pretty sure they could have turned in the map to McGonagall to help with the hunt for the person attempting to kill muggle borns as an alternative.    

Basically, my new theory is that the Map was never planned for in books 1&2 and it was an asspull plot device for book 3 and trying to retcon the first 2 books to account for its existence is a fucking headache."
