The wave was brought forth by a propaganda artist who popularized what is  known to art historians as ""kampfkunst"" or ""struggle art"". The Holocaust started a year earlier due to Hitler's success in art school, and concentration camps operated well into the 60s. Europe watched in awe of the Reichs clear vision for a prosperous future, and the EU was formed to peacefully pursue shared goals in eugenics, medicine, and engineering. The US and Russia became great enemies, deciding to focus on militaristic science instead, and by 2010, they had weakened each other enough to allow the EU to invade over the next decade, finally establisbing the Universal Fourth Reich in 2020."
