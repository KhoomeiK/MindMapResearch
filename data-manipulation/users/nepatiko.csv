shittytattoos,ff0ll79,t1_fezfbn3,1579470027.0,"Tbh it's not necessary ugle (nothing a lol touch up couldn't fix), I just hate that it's literally just a rectangle lmao."
shittytattoos,ff0lcxb,t1_feznukk,1579469940.0,Lmao never thought of that! Good one
shittytattoos,ff0l7ik,t1_fezsbv2,1579469885.0,"Idk I don't necessarily regret this though. Now it just makes for a funny story! But to be honest if my parents had tried to try to stop me from getting a tattoo, it'd have made me want to get one even more. Be careful about that! Teenage minds are peculiar"
shittytattoos,feyw28t,t1_feysc57,1579451152.0,Lmao can't beat that

Aquariums,fexr7lq,t3_equisd,1579435024.0,I bet you can purchase some automatic feeders that dispense food at a set time. Have you tried looking for those?

NoStupidQuestions,fdh5th7,t1_fdh5os2,1578416008.0,Dang... Wild to imagine that I might live to see something like this.
NoStupidQuestions,fdh2fa7,t1_fdh2a98,1578413920.0,Damn right! Gotta try while there's still time. This is gonna require some DRASTIC changes though
NoStupidQuestions,fdh253a,t1_fdh1o15,1578413743.0,"Yeah I realize that. I'm feeling the effects of climate change and it's genuinely concerning. We've got no snow in Lithuania but a decade ago you'd have snow up at least up to your knees at this point. The summers are scorching hot compared to even a few years ago and a LOT of heatwaves started occuring. And these changes aren't even that horrible compared to other countries.  It's stressing me tf out, but it does calm me down that we still have a chance to fix this. Please don't try this sense of stability away from me:)"
NoStupidQuestions,fdh1ggv,t1_fdh1ato,1578413311.0,Yeah but we still got time! That's the best news I've heard in quite a while

NoStupidQuestions,fdh0tyz,t1_fdh07wh,1578412914.0,"Very true! And I'm trying to change my habits because of this, but my personal changes won't be enough if them big companies like Nestle won't stop pouring absurd amount of chemicals into the atmosphere.
To clarify, I'm not glad that Earth will end in a couple hundred years, but I'm glad to know that we have some time to slow down climate change cause I was certain that most life on Earth will cease to exist in a couple of decades and we're way beyond return."
NoStupidQuestions,fdh03je,t1_fdgzwgz,1578412447.0,"Yeah this question always fucked with me but then I realized I can just, like, adopt? I mean they're already there so I'm not bringing them into this world to suffer. (I'm still 17 and wanna have kids in the future for context lol)"
NoStupidQuestions,fdgzo89,t1_fdgz2r2,1578412175.0,Damn I genuinely thought it'd be like 15-20 years tops. That's kinda nice to hear!
