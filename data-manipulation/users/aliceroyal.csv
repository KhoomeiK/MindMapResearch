We talked about our conservative Catholic family and how nasty they are to people who don't fit the correct political/moral mold, and my relative chose to disclose that they had had an abortion as a teenager without telling \*anyone\* about the pregnancy or the abortion. They had (and still have) no regrets. I felt honored that they were comfortable sharing that with me...I'm 100% sure their life would have been very different if they had decided to carry to term."

You have a disability, you are entitled to reasonable accommodation under the ADA and Title IX (at least if you're in the US, but other countries have similar laws). Asking for the prof to use a color you can see is certainly 'reasonable', and the prof was absolutely being unreasonable and discriminatory under the law--not to mention an asshole under basic decency.

I highly recommend seeing if your uni has a disability services office and getting in touch as well. They can help you with contacting all of your professors to explain your needs formally, on paper, which helps a lot if one of them wants to be a dick about it. I am disabled and I worked for that office in college and there were always one or two profs who raised a fuss but knowing it was coming from the office/could easily be reported to a dean helped. You can get profs to use the right color markers plus things like recorded lectures, having someone like that other student share their notes with you, etc. Hope it all works out for you :)"

I used my tax return last year to buy a refurbished model ($50-100 cheaper usually) with a ramp so my disabled kitty can use it along with his able-bodied elder brother. 

I have depression and I was buying non-clumping litter and just dumping it once a WEEK. It was disgusting and shameful, not to mention a health hazard for the cats. I empty my LR once or twice a week now but since it’s always scooped clean it’s so much better for them. I buy one $30 box of Slide litter every two months vs. $50/month of the non-clumping. You really should use the Slide with it. Works better than any other litter.
