worldnews,fgufkxa,t1_fgr66v6,1581119583.0,"It's because everyone expected Mueller to go after and do serious damage to a man unchecked in a position of power. Mueller's decisions will be studied for a long time, but many of his *inactions,* made his final report a firecracker at best.

Nearly half the country pined their hopes on him, that as Special Counsel, he would shock the system back towards equilibrium. Instead, he punted to Congress; a Congress thoroughly compromised to Russian and Trumpian interests. If not conspiracy, that would at least to many, show that Mueller for all that he was relegated to be of character and integrity, did not have the character and integrity to do the action that *was* necessary for the greater public and instead invoked a path or process that was almost guaranteed to lead to disillusionment.

When *that* happens, the emotional value you assign someone drops if not evacuates altogether. It's not that you have witnessed more escalations so profound that you can't devote time and memory to keep him in the foreground of current events. It's more that he, through his actions, created a perception of letting the idea of justice down. House moved to Impeachment, in many ways, because the Mueller Report was a waste of time. It consolidated many things that were circumstantially known, though not explicitly at the time, but did very little beyond.

The investigation also removed several actors from the stage, but those actors had already played that their part and were low hanging fruit. Essentially, an easy out took place; and for a man who supposedly rose to fame in taking down a mafia crime family and Enron, the outcome of the Trump investigation, comparatively, was honestly pathetic.

In other words, you stopped giving a shit about him and that's why you forgot. Everyone only has a finite amount of emotional quotient available to be distributed across a variety of things in their life. Mueller failed, in whatever assignment given to him and the public sentiment that backed him to it's end, and thus your brain subconsciously said ""I had put 10 points in his bucket. That's a terrible waste. Flush and reassign."""

climate,fgoiy35,t1_fgniruf,1580971683.0,"There's a YouTube channel that broke down what it would take to fly an electric 737 across the Atlantic. You'd basically need 2-3x the weight of the plane in LiON batteries to get it off the ground and keep it in air long enough to fly across the Atlantic, of a current 737 design.

For context, consider this:

If scientists announced literally tomorrow they've made a game changing breakthrough, 2x energy density per kilogram of kerosene in electric batteries in the same volume of space. It will take at least 3-5 years for it to leave the lab and get to market. Once in market, it will take another 1-2 years to scale to mass production, and another 2-3 years beyond that to be incorporated into plane designs which are tested, certified and human rated, before being opened up to the public to fly in. So a minimum of 6 years from *tomorrow* for the first electric mass transport of significance. Maximum of 10 years.

If the announcement comes in 3 years, then add 10 years on top of that before it gets to market."
climate,fgoiuwr,t3_ezbf4w,1580971587.0,"That's because there's no current breakthrough that can match the energy density of kerosene per kilogram. Airlines can only take things so far with frame design. They're working on newer wings, shark winglets for better efficiency in the air, engines that allow for longer flights, and other little things that can move more people for similar amounts of fuel utilization. 

Until we achieve a breakthrough, where mass market scalability allows for a switch to an electric fleet, we're stuck pretty with fossil fuels for our transportation economy. It's easy to say we need to go green here, but running things on the ground or even in water is *massively* easier than flying.
