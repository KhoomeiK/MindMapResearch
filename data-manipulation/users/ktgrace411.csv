labrador,fcnfkwm,t1_fcne0hv,1577810699.0,"Thank you, I appreciate you clarification that means a lot to me. Like I said in my post: I‚Äôve heard valid arguments from both campus and ultimately I‚Äôm just grateful this goofy little girl came into my life regardless of the ultimate conclusion about silvers."
labrador,fcnbzmg,t1_fcn2spe,1577808405.0,"Hi! Just to jump in: 
1. Not sure why you felt the need to comment this on the post of my pup. I‚Äôm not trying to promote silver labs or engage in dialogue. Just sharing a photo of my beloved dog.
2. I rescued Scout, did not get her from a breeder. Since then I‚Äôve become very familiar with the debate around silver labs. I don‚Äôt feel the need to jump into the fray but what I can say is Scout is sweet, affectionate, and does not have skin issues. 
3. AKC doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúnot recognize‚Äù silvers they content that their original definition of chocolate includes a variety of shades including a light brown or silver-ish color. Again, doesn‚Äôt really matter to me but just giving and FYI. 
4. There is vehement feelings on both sides of the debate. It not worth my energy being impassioned on either side. However, please keep in mind she‚Äôs my cherished dog, and all I was doing was sharing what I think is a beautiful photo.
All the Best."
