cats,fcotody,t3_ei7ums,1577841263.0,Vinegar might be a safer bet then bleach. Personally I never let bleach anywhere near my stuff. I’ve found I’m pretty sensitive to the stuff. But due to be using the brita filter pitcher with mine I have to clean it far less and same with the filter. Though I do tend to top it up once a day with the pitcher.

cats,fcojlza,t1_fcojhtk,1577833866.0,"Exactly!  More water is better. Also I bought my cats a big fuzzy, plushy like cat cave for Christmas and one of my cats LOVES it!"
cats,fcojbc3,t1_fcoj6hr,1577833644.0,I have the circle one!  And I think so too. I used to have this huge clunky one and it was a pain to clean. I also have a brita filter pitcher I use to put water in it. It’s abit pricy. But it cuts down on calcium residue and cleaning honestly.
cats,fcoj27l,t1_fcobfr9,1577833457.0,I got my cats one of those daisy water fountain and they love it. And It’s super easy to clean.
