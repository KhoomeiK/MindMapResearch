occult,ffzqpph,t3_ew576u,1580390105.0,It happens to me when I do rituals. I actually made a post about this on the /Wicca page. It happens to a lot of people and if your intentions right :) I feel they’d understand
bipolar2,ffzqlq8,t3_ew54ly,1580390009.0,It looks cute though
Psychic,ffsf5tr,t3_euzenm,1580180205.0,It’s happening already. People are going to awaken thru tragic events
Wicca,ffqjmw6,t1_ffqjh1u,1580136417.0,Thank you! Your coven sounds like an open group. :)
Psychic,ffqeaap,t3_eunmut,1580131985.0,Sick and anxious
Dreams,ffou9kq,t3_euezmz,1580081921.0,I have dreams about rape every now and then and just had one recently. Yes it did put me into a shock and it is scary. But what helps me is breathing and telling myself I’m awake and that didn’t happen. And to think of all the good things that happened in real life. Reassurance helps me the most.
Psychic,ffou1mq,t3_euf2i8,1580081833.0,It feels haunted tbh..
tarot,ffm9tpc,t3_eu7oev,1580051039.0,Imo. To me this seems that she will recover and be strong which I’m guessing she is in this perjod now.. but to keep healthy habits that will keep her strong bc their might be health complications on the way
Wicca,ffkj9wd,t1_ffkj542,1580023685.0,Thank you! Yes this ceremony seems very personal :) I have a bond with nature so this seems so awesome
