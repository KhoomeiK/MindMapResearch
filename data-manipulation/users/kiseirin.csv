television,fe07b3g,t3_chbj3f,1578804950.0,"That's true. Schur has said in interviews that he prefers to have his comedies be more optimistic and he purposefully stays away from cynicism.

It comes down to personal preference, whether you prefer this kind of humor or not. Some people like the more optimistic humor that Schur's sitcoms have. For me, I find that cynical humor tends to make me laugh more, but optimistic humor tends to bring me back to the show more. 

As long as the writing is strong, I don't really mind what tone the show goes for. My favourite comedies of all time are Arrested Development and The Good Place. AD is a lot more cynical in tone, but the jokes are so well written that I can't help but laugh out loud. And TGP has such excellent writing, characterization, world building and theme exploration that I honestly couldn't care less that it's not as funny as some other shows."

Veep,fd970om,t1_fd7oy2w,1578229289.0,"Not confusing, I just don't find it very funny, apart from some lines of witty dialogue. It just makes me feel like I'm watching a different show from everyone else, because others say that they found the show very funny. 

The show is still great, I just feel like I'm missing out on something."
getdisciplined,fc8staj,t1_fc55j3a,1577541344.0,"My thoughts exactly. The breaking point for whether you want to be great at a subject shouldn't be whether you're ""talented"" enough, but whether you're passionate about the subject. As long as you're passionate about something, being ""untalented"" is nothing but a hurdle to cross.

Thanks for sharing that anecdote, I'm going to be saving it for whenever I feel down or unmotivated."
getdisciplined,fc8rxlf,t1_fc24ivr,1577540902.0,"I agree. When performance and skill can be broken down, studied and applied to others, it makes the whole point of ""talent"" a bit moot"
getdisciplined,fc8rliu,t1_fc2tg8v,1577540733.0,"I believe both, that intellect can be divided and each subgroup is quantifiable. And yes, some people do have higher innate intellect than others, but it can still definitely be improved. The brain may not really be a muscle but it can still be exercised and improved."
getdisciplined,fc8r8bp,t1_fc20dw3,1577540540.0,"That's a good point. I used to be one of those people, who just kept reading self-help books and just using them to make me feel better, instead of actually improving my life. 

The thing is, though, the idea of ""success"" (in any form), at least to me, acts as a goal, and just having that goal motivates me to work. The plus side is, you end up doing good things along the way."
