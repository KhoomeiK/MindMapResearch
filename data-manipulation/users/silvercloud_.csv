offmychest,feu6e3v,t1_fel2d1c,1579383546.0,Thanks for the honesty and realistic mindset... going through something mental and really needed to read what you placed about fear.
bigdickproblems,fes61l4,t3_epb7m0,1579361817.0,"DHT has more to do with masculine secondary sex characteristics, so a  man with a very hairy chest and stomach, a hairy back and arms, and lots of leg hair would be more likely to lose the hair on his head than a twinky kind of guy. Jf if you’re fat, your body hair genetics don’t apply because the fat crowds out follicles. This is the reverse genetics of it, as men with lots of body hair usually have bigger cocks, but this doesn’t exclude smoother guys because their body hair follicles may be less receptive to DHT."

offmychest,fel16q5,t1_fekxpz4,1579211841.0,"God, same. It’s like suddenly hitting a point in life where everything that used to be “fun” feels “broke” and the only things worth doing are socializing (which is a crapshoot 60% of the time), eating, and creating. Not even sarcastic, I think people get raptured or something when they have “PTSD” (a symptom of modern society - no civilian /should/ have PTSD) and can reach a state of permanent anxiety about nothing. Then others gaslight your experiences because of the NSA or whetfer they’re scared of?  Nah, I’m outtie. Small inner circles are smarter if the universe is heating up. Less traffic to the destination ;)"

biology,fe8zbw0,t1_fe02gzl,1578932514.0,You literally just rewrote the original post in your own holier-than-though style. Static. You filled my brain with statis.
antidepressants,fe8xb8p,t1_fe07ee9,1578931997.0,"Yes! Wellbutrin (DNRI) covers my SAD, helps me manage my ADHD, and helps me smoke less cigarettes. Sertraline (SSRI) makes it easier for me to mentally focus and calm my senses when I have panic attack’s associated to PTSD related to a sexual assault. Modafinil (NDRI) helps me stay alert enough to be truly awake, not just “aroused” as adderall made me feels. I likely have narcolepsy... Adderall (DRA) hallucinoses are certainly more auditory but more like I can hear my own internal voice louder and more clearly, which is amazing for executive functioning but not for staying awake. 
Buspirone (SNRI) helps me slow my breathing and heart rate when anxiety shows up. It is a non-benzo anxiolytic and mental stimulant. 
Awaiting my Narcolepsy with Cataplexy diagnosis from a sleep specialist. I have all the genes for it, ADHD, and seasonal affective disorder. Hope this helped!"
antidepressants,fdzwply,t3_emyvpb,1578797634.0,"I did the health + ancestry for $200. The expensive part of the process is getting ur genetic codes, which you get from 23&me."
antidepressants,fdvzv8o,t1_fdsx5bz,1578753568.0,"23&me has the .zip file, you just download it after getting your results from them!"
antidepressants,fdsr0wn,t3_emyvpb,1578706827.0,"It’s a scam for anything detailed. They just tell you if your piss smells like asparagus or how likely you are to be a deep or light sleeper etc. However, you can download your raw genome as a .zip and upload it into medically reviewed research sites for a service charge (Promethease is the one I used, $12) which will cross reference your SNPs with international medical journals and you can use this info to figure out what may work. 

EX; 23&Me said I am probably a coffee drinker and cigarette smoker, but Promethease showed which genes for ADHD I had, which gave me an idea on what medications would work best for the anxiety and depressions."
