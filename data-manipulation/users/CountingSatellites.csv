It’s next level genetics where researchers are finding that environmental exposure or conditioning of stress, fear, anxiety, etc can be passed to offspring- not even just when experienced in utero, but even long before offspring are even conceived. 

With humans, they’re finding that the children of parents that experienced war, famine, or other trauma can pass on the effects of those experiences via chemical markers on there genes [to their future children and even grandchildren.](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190326-what-is-epigenetics)

With mice, they’ve found that conditioning male mice to a fearful stimulus will result in their future offspring showing the same fear response to the same stimulus even though those offspring had never actually been exposed to it previously.

I agree with much of your philosophy, but honestly, it sounds like you need a compromise. You’re absolutely right that the only way this is going to get better is with consistent training. But keep in mind, training a reactive dog is a marathon, not a sprint, and it can be mentally and emotionally exhausting. It’s important to take care of yourself and manage your own stress levels along the way.

It sounds like you’re really committed to physical exercise to get rid of his energy, but this is not the only way to tire a dog out (and shouldn’t be.) Mental enrichment (provided by things like nose games, puzzles toys, trick training, etc) is just as, if not more, important as physical exercise, and it has the advantage of being calming and often reducing anxiety. Your dog also needs to learn to relax on his own and just be able to chill. Look up [calmness training](https://youtu.be/wesm2OpE_2c).

As for walks, its okay to turn around and go home if your dog is too anxious and reacting. In fact, it’s probably better that you do. Read about [Trigger Stacking](http://www.woofliketomeet.com/2016/03/trigger-stacking-how-we-set-our-dogs-up-to-fail/) to better understand this. You’re not gaining anything by continuing to push your dog over their threshold. No learning is happening at that point.

I also agree that you should never be allowing your dog off leash in a public space. A dog park is no place for a reactive pit. (I say this as the owner of a pit mix.) If anything goes wrong, even if your dog doesn’t start it, you will be blamed.

There’s no one way to train a reactive dog. Someone else mentioned that you should be listening to your dog (their body language, reactions, what they respond best to) and adjusting your training based on that, and I agree. I’d really recommend you pick up a copy of the book [The Other End of the Leash by Patricia McConnell](https://www.amazon.com/Other-End-Leash-What-Around/dp/034544678X/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?keywords=the+other+end+of+the+leash&qid=1579730497&sprefix=the+other+end+of+t&sr=8-2). 
The author is a well-renowned behaviorist that has a lot of experience with reactivity and other problem behaviors, and this book will help you both better understand your dog which should help get you on the same page."
reactivedogs,ff0ffi4,t1_fez7w02,1579468354.0,"Sitting by the window is not a bad thing unless he’s reacting /barking at things outside. It provides mental stimulation, and that’s good. If he reacts to dogs, people, or other things outside the window, you can use that as an opportunity to countercondition. Or you can calmly remove him from the situation- just don’t allow him to react uncontrollably to whatever triggers him- it’s self-rewarding and just makes reactivity worse.

It’s important that dogs learn to chill and relax and entertain themselves in appropriate ways. Look up”calmness training.” Be sure you also provide a variety of safe chews- chewing is relaxing and a good way for a dog to pass the time.

Mental stimulation will also tire a dog out, often better than physical exercise. Puzzle toys, nose games, and positive-reinforcement based obedience or trick training are great ways of providing mental exercise. As will making your walks “sniffy walks.”

I realize he’s already eating about 30% less than the amount on the bag/can, but those amounts are geared towards young active dogs and often recommend more than what many dogs need.

If you’re worried about him feeling hungry if you cut back his food more, you can substitute some of his food for canned plain pumpkin or green beans which are both lower calorie and easy on sensitive stomachs. Lots of dogs really like green beans, so you could maybe use fresh or frozen beans as treats. Make sure any treats you do give are small pieces.

You could also have him work for his food by putting it in a treat ball or something like the Kong wobbler. It’ll get him moving a bit more, and it’s also really great for mental exercise.

If he suffers from some joint pain, look into a join supplement to help strengthen them. But, the best thing you can do for that which will make the most difference is to get the extra weight off.

You said you can’t really extend his walks, so instead you could try to make them more productive by finding a place to walk that has more hills. You’ll burn a few more calories that way.

Bad owners can certainly create a bad/problematic dog whether that be blatant abuse/neglect, training a dog to be aggressive, etc, or simply not training or socializing them well. 

On the other hand, a good owner that treats their dog well, provides for their physical and mental needs, trains and socialized them, is going to greatly increase their chances of having a well-adjusted good dog.

But that is just not all there is to it. Good or bad owner, you’re still dealing with the individual temperament of that dog, and some dogs are predisposed to fear, anxiety, reactivity and aggression. Not to mention more normal and accepted behavior that can make for a more difficult dog such as high prey drive, “independence” - aka not biddable/easy to train, distrust of strangers, etc.

Even the best owners and trainers can have a dog with behavior and aggression issues, and the difference comes down to how they’re managed. Good trainers with aggressive dogs or dogs with behavior issues work hard to manage those issues. They train coping mechanisms, desensitize and counter-condition. They don’t put their dogs in situations that aggravate those issues, like taking their dog to the dog park or to busy public places. (Or in the case of [hacks like Mr. Milan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/56dht5/discussion_ok_lay_it_on_me_why_is_caesar_milan/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app ), they apply outdated and disproven dominance theory methods to bully a dog into complying.)

Let’s take well-renowned behaviorist Patricia McConnell, for example, whose life work is to study animal behavior and worked for decades with difficult dogs using actual science-based methods. She’s written extensively about her reactive selectively dog-aggressive Border Collie (RIP Willy)- a dog that she trained from puppy-hood, socialized extensively, and worked with closely for the work he was bred to do: herd sheep. Willie showed signs of reactivity as a very young pup, and it was an ongoing effort over many years to get that dog to a better place.

So yes, experienced trainers can have aggressive dogs or dogs with behavioral issues. They just manage and work with them to try and make it less of an issue. Level of success depends on BOTH dog and owner (and some dogs unfortunately cannot be helped.)

As much as people with easy well-behaved well-adjusted dogs would like to believe, it’s not just them, and a dog that has behavioral or aggression issues is not necessarily the fault of the owner."
dogs,fec6y53,t1_febh3ej,1578967702.0,"Yes, I did say more likely because animals are still individuals, and although a breed as a whole will have certain traits, individuals within that group will vary. That doesn’t change the fact that dogs can be genetically predisposed to dog aggression. And what is it that you think a specific breed is if not a group of genetically similar individuals bred for a specific purpose? Even the breed clubs recognize this- Akita’s, pits, chows, bull terriers, etc- all more likely to be genetically predisposed to dog aggression. 

And for the record, I have a pit mix - I think most pits are lovely dogs, but I also believe in being honest about the breed and the issues they face. Being dishonest about the fact that they are more likely to be dog-aggressive than other breeds (which no, I’m not saying that all will be) is setting them and their owners up to fail.

It is also harmful to the people with difficult dogs that train and socialize and treat their dogs well but still have a dog that is reactive or doesn’t get along with other dogs.

She is also rewarded with treats for walking a ways without any tension.

We didn’t move very far when I first started doing this... it went something like this:
Start walking, she lunges ahead and pulls, stop, cue her to sit, start moving while luring her to not lunge ahead by holding a treat at my side, give treat, she’d lunge ahead again... repeat. It took 15-20 min to go half a block. Vigorous play before the “walk” helps to get out some of the pent up energy and excitement.

Eventually she started getting the idea that tension=stop, no tension=reward+movement, and I started to increase the amount of time between treats. Now, she usually needs some reminding at the start of our walks, but then the rest of our walk is much more relaxed with only a reminder now and then.

Treat scatters are what worked best to desensitize her, that and “leave it” when she started to focus on the car. Asking her to sit and focus on me was too much to start with, but we worked our way there eventually.

Teach the treat scatters as a cue and practice often in non-distracting situations and randomly on walks- I say “go find!” And then drop a small handful of treats on the ground to sniff out. You’ll probably have to use really good treats like bits of real chicken or hot dogs to start with. (I would buy pre-cooked chicken strips in deli section because super easy). The goal is that he will instantly start searching the ground for treats when you give the cue. To start with, even if you can get his attention for a few seconds, you’re doing good. Eventually, you want him to look to you for treats when he hears a car coming because that means your counter-conditioning is working.

Do the treat scatter as soon as you notice a car approaching, before they get anxious about it. That way, at the point when they would normally react, he’ll instead be too focused on the food. Continue to drop treats until the car has passed. Sniffing is a relaxing thing for most dogs, so it has that advantage as well.

Whatever technique you use, try to practice at a distance where he’s aware but below the threshold where he would react. You will make the most progress this way.

Your dog is still adjusting to his new home and people. His stress levels are high and he hasn’t yet developed trust and a strong bond with you.

And, It’s okay to keep walks to a minimum at this point while you work on this issue. Keep them short and go out at quiet times when there is less traffic. If he’s reacting to every car, he’s at the point that he can’t learn, and it’s best to turn around and go home instead of further increasing his anxiety.

Shameless plug for r/reactivedogs"
Dogtraining,fdem8pm,t1_fdei6qg,1578341998.0,"It’s possible that’s the case, but it’s also very likely not. It’s more likely that he just wasn’t fully socialized as a pup. Lots of dogs that have never been mistreated are fearful of men, since, generally speaking, men are larger/taller and have deeper voices which is typically more intimidating. It’s also not uncommon for some dogs to react poorly to seemingly innocuous things that they aren’t as familiar with, like hats/hoods, glasses, walkers, or even something like the way a person stands or moves.

What you’re dealing with is fear reactivity. You can address it with a training program of desensitization and counter-conditioning. The goal is to change their perceptions about the things they find scary by pairing them with really good things- think pavlov’s dogs.

Dogtraining,fddaabh,t1_fdcsdj1,1578302260.0,"Neat! Thanks for sharing those results! Pretty cool that she’s got both Catahoula and Aussie. I follow r/doggyDNA, and it seems that the majority of merle dogs that come up there are from Aussie genetics- not as many that are actually catahoula.  And you’re right- her nose sure is quite a bit longer than it appears in your original photo. She’s such a pretty girl."
dogs,fdbmvkv,t1_fda3dij,1578258975.0,"It’s a good idea to keep them tethered to you with a leash while your home, and if you can’t supervise, a crate is a good idea. Proper crate training take time, though. 

When I got my dog, she didn’t like being in the crate- she didn’t want to go in, and it took her about 15 min to settle down after I left. I couldn’t really avoid it because I also had to go to work, and she would certainly destroy things if I left her out. But, we worked on proper crate training in the evenings, and now she enjoys her crate (often choosing it over the couch!)"
Dogtraining,fdbktoo,t1_fdbgnxo,1578258328.0,"Op says she’s catahoula/BC, but if they haven’t done a dna test I’d guess probably Aussie/pit due to the popularity of merle Aussies and her blocky features."

reactivedogs,fd7lxhy,t3_ek2lou,1578206512.0,"Your dog has developed reactivity/aggression towards other dogs, but that does not mean it will turn into aggression towards people. Many dogs are perfectly fine around people, but just don’t do well with other dogs.

It also doesn’t mean that you did anything wrong that led to this. Often, there is a strong genetic component to reactivity, and some dogs, no matter how well they’re socialized, will become intolerant to other dogs.

The good news is, there is a lot you can do to help manage this with proper training, and your dog can still be a wonderful pet. Although you’re going to have to change your expectations a bit, I’m afraid. (Which honestly, is often one of the harder parts about having a reactive dog, as many here can relate.) 

You can probably eventually get to the point where you can take him hiking or to the beach (on-leash), but dog parks and other places with off-leash dogs will be out of the question.

You mention that he’s worse with you than he is with your husband- that’s likely not a protective thing, but probably him feeding off of your own anxiety about the situation. Reactivity is often based in fear and anxiety- the mentality of “I’ll get him before he gets me.” If you are anxious, your dog will feed off of that, and it’ll make their reaction worse.

A big part of reactive dog training is about building confidence.  Teaching your dog appropriate behavior so they know how to handle a situation, teaching them to look to you and trust you for guidance, and that means confident and positive handling on your part, and setting your dog up to succeed. It means you practice your handling techniques often so that you both know what to do and how to react when you encounter another dog.

Anyway...

Here’s a list of resources that I’ve been compiling that I’ve found very helpful with my own dog (a GSD/pit/husky mix). We’ve also worked with trainers well versed in reactivity, so I’ve included some of the skills commonly taught in reactive dog classes. Some of this is geared specifically toward leash reactivity, but the same concepts apply to other situations.

Foundation Skills

When dealing with reactivity, being able to get your dog’s attention or employ a distraction at the right moment is really critical. These are foundation skills for dealing with reactivity.

[Name game](https://www.clickertraining.com/node/4386) (a clicker is not essential- you can use your praise word instead.) Goal: focus.

[Look at Me](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/training/dogs-attention-look-command/). Goal: Focus

[It’s Your Choice](https://susangarrettdogagility.com/2018/06/why-choice-is-the-critical-key-to-a-great-dog/). Goal: Impulse control

[Leave It](https://resources.bestfriends.org/article/how-teach-dog-leave-it) (Make sure you are giving a different treat, not the one they’re supposed to leave.) Goal: Impulse control

[Emergency U-turn](http://tuffpuptraining.com/blog/2015/1/9/masterung-the-emergency-u-turn). Goal: Management- being able to get out of a situation that will cause the dog to go over threshold.

[Find It](https://journeydogtraining.com/basic-steps-reactive-dog-training/) Goal: Distraction/diffusion

[Engage/Disengage](https://positivepartnersdogtraining.com/the-engage-disengage-game-help-for-reactive-dogs/). Goal: counterconditioning and desensitization.

Start by working on these skills in a quiet area indoors, gradually increasing distractions. Then start practicing outdoors in an area with few distractions, again gradually increasing distractions. This is the key to getting a distracted dog to pay attention to you outside. If your dog can’t focus, you need to take a step back (quite literally, in some cases). Set your dog up to succeed- try not to put them in situations where they will fail."

DoggyDNA,fcv2ko9,t3_ej0gia,1577993333.0,"Wow. I wonder how accurate that Pharaoh Hound dna actually is. It’s not a common breed, and very very rarely legitimately found in mixed breeds. (In fact, the only records that [Embark seems to have](https://my.embarkvet.com/breeds/pharaoh_hound#dogs) of the breed are purebreds- no mixed breeds.)"
AskVet,fcuqzem,t1_fcujowx,1577986726.0,I’m pretty sure they understand they need to get the cone on. They are asking for advice on how to go about doing that safely.
DoggyDNA,fcuorld,t3_eizorl,1577985488.0,"Full-blooded pits can have prick ears, it’s just not as common. I don’t see any GSD in her. GSD ears have a very different shape."
madisonwi,fcsjna5,t1_fcoifc2,1577917899.0,"As the owner of a pit mix, i agree with much of what you say. I think it’s important to be realistic and honest about the breed. They can be wonderful when raised and trained and socialized properly, and a good dog can be ruined when not. But, despite what some would like to believe, it is absolutely NOT just about how you raise them, and believing so is ignorant and harmful because it leads to people getting dogs (of all breeds) that are unsuitable for their lifestyle or ones that they can’t handle. At best, this results in more dogs ending up in shelters... At worst, it can lead to dangerous situations.

Pits are not nanny dogs as some claim. That idea is ridiculous and doesn’t help the breed at all, in fact, I’d say it does just the opposite and gives the anti-pit crowd even more fodder. They are terriers that were bred (and still are, unfortunately) for dog fighting, and as such they tend to be higher energy, have a high prey drive, and can also be prone to dog aggression (after age 2, in particular). Even the breed clubs acknowledge and understand this. Rampant irresponsible breeding has resulted in dogs all across the temperament spectrum, though, so while these are general characteristics, it’s really a mixed bag of of what you’ll get."
reactivedogs,fcmh5q1,t1_fcm34dv,1577775090.0,"Those first several months are the hardest... especially that point where you’re at now- when the excitement of a new pet has subsided and yet they’re still settling in, you’re still getting to know and understand each other, and you’re learning to deal with reactivity on top of that."

reactivedogs,fbxeamr,t1_fbu3sbu,1577182829.0,"Just so there’s no confusion, you absolutely can have rules and structure with positive reinforcement training. In fact, it’s an integral part of it for most dogs."
