relationship_advice,ffvodbz,t3_ev66yp,1580268901.0,"OP, you have not actually been in this relationship for 16 years, you've been an adult for 4 or 5 years. Ignore the part of you that believes the sunk cost fallacy and chalk up the last couple of years to a learning, because if you stay, you will lose the rest of your life. I feel for you dear, but this will cost you everything if you don't go."
