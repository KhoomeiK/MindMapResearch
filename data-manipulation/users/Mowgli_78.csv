PhoenixPoint,ffcw1ug,t3_esro63,1579808454.0,"In addition to all already said, I would like to highlight what is IMHO a fatal flaw of PP, which no matter how you look at it, was born to be compared to XCOM2 WotC.

Shooting. Not the in-game rules or the first person PoV but *the* feeling. In Gatecrasher you start with rifles, rifles that ra-ta-ta pretty well for 3-5 damage. Everytime you hit it feels *good*, powerful. RA-TA-TA. It might have to do with sound design (an essential part of video game development) or the way the rag dolls behave, or the very brief cutscene you get every single time. Every ra-ta-ta feels different yet good and powerful. It's exciting.

Later on you get pew-pews and shooms-shooms, environment reacts, windows break and vehicles kaboom. When you end a factory mission you behold the mayhem you caused from the Skyranger.

All these feelings disappear like tears in the rain in PP. It's just dull. A wall is just a poligon. Enemies fall on the spot. Every shot is just dice rolling. It's hard to explain, PP feels like chess, and I love chess, but XCOM feels like Call of Duty. Call it inmersion or catharsis, but XCOM is alive and thrilling and PP is bland, boring. It all get worse when you compare cutscenes made in-engine with a yet another grim sci-fi art. (IMHO!) 


In the end, tl;dr: XCOM is fun, but not only for gameplay reasons. We all wanted PP to be awesome, but it isn't and I don't know how to make it better without overhauling sound and visuals. Thinking about PP, about what it could have been, makes me somehow sad."
