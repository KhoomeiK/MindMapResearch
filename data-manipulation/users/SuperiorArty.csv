Showerthoughts,fgnyrxk,t1_fgnml3q,1580955874.0,"Actually, they changed it for awhile in the comics to tie in to the movies. He got the power by being killed by a vampiric like villain, then being reborn into a mutant spider that ate the previously mentioned villain, died, then gave birth to a fully matured Peter Parker...

AND THEN, when they decide to get rid of it, the decided to have Aunt May get shot, forcing Peter to travel across the marvel universe to various characters like Doctor Doom and Doctor Strange, only to be told they can’t heal a bullet wound. So Peter decided to make a deal with the literal devil by trading his (twenty year old in real life) marriage with Mary Jane.

And they still haven’t reverted that decision"
