I’d be... well, semi-wary of taking Kratom as an addict. My brother (who has a very addictive personality) has a Kratom problem. I mean, he’s tried to taper down, and has bad anxiety if he doesn’t take it. It’s not a totally faultless plant. It’s helped people get off heroin and other drugs, absolutely, and its effects and withdrawal aren’t nearly as dangerous or bad as say heroin, if at all. But if you trust yourself and occasionally are able to do t breaks, it’s worth a try.

kratom,fficuwu,t3_etsl25,1579970845.0,"I’d start with 1.5-2grams (a little under 3-4 capsules). I started w/ 2grams once a day. LESS IS MORE. Take more and you risk vomiting and passing out (I mean, being sedated). So less is more at first.

You’ll hopefully feel energized but calm. I liken it to the energy of adderall (without grinding teeth, heart pounding, being unable to eat), plus the calmness of Xanax (without the drowsiness). It’s really a great plant. Helps with my anxiety, pain, tachycardia syndrome and depression.

Also, strange thing: I haven’t had a cold in over 1.5 years. Haven’t been sick. Apparently Kratom contains antioxidants and I wonder if the antioxidants in Kratom are preventing me from being sick."

It’s criminal.

I don’t get why insurance won’t cover a drug. Do they want us to be hospitalized or institutionalized? *because hospitalization is actually more $$ than the drug itself. Give me the drug, and you won’t have to spend $$ on me in the hospital every other month!* Dumbasses."

What they don’t tell you is, depression gives us the empathy we need to really relate to people on a bigger level. It’s a huge curse, but sometimes a gift.

Even as a teen I said to myself “I will be for others what I never had for myself”.

So here i am. I have a ways to go, but genuinely helping others is natural to me. Because of the torture I went through."

I have an issue with auditory processing and if someone tells me to do something it goes in one ear out the other no matter how well I listen. Currently I’m at a job where my supervisor knows I’m autistic and she’s GREAT about it. I’ve had 2-3 sensory meltdowns/panic attacks at work and even then she’s understanding. It’s a dream come true. I’ve had workplaces where I was ostracized or discriminated against, and this is not one of them.

A diagnosis was great for me to be validated and it’ll be great if I get accommodations when I go back to school, so I heavily suggest you do get that diagnosis.

Shockingly, I just moved out of my parents’ place at 24 and it’s been surprisingly good for me (despite my huge worries that I wouldn’t be able to function, executive function issues). I feel so much better about myself now that I’ve moved out and proven I’m capable.

I highly recommend occupational therapy. It can be made specific for autistic people."

aspergers,ff94gxq,t3_esadtd,1579704620.0,"There’s the extreme male brain theory, which I do not subscribe to, that many people think autism (especially in women) revolves around.

I don’t subscribe to this as its pretty sexist and stereotypes men and autistic people further.

Yeah, I definitely have more “male” interests but remember that gender is mainly a social construct and women are probably only *expected* to be more social than men through gender norms.

Also that autism probably isn’t that much more common in men—but that women are held to different standards and so aren’t diagnosed as easily.

Disclaimer: I have a few mom/dad friends, and respect good parents immensely. But should a screaming 3 yo be in a movie theater? Should a kid be kicking my seat on the plane?

I don’t like kids but tolerate them in places they can be, like a doctors office or the supermarket, AS LONG AS they aren’t shitheads. But more and more parents are parenting through iPads and iPhones, and when their kid misbehaves, I have EVERY right to be fucking annoyed! Especially if you don’t discipline them!

BUT, please don’t go for it. Even if you’re a very mature 15 yo, it doesn’t matter. A 23 yo man does NOT have any business being with a minor. It’s one thing if you’re 24 and he’s 32. You’re both adults. But 15 and 23... is wrong, legally and maturity wise. I promise you in only 2-3 years you’ll look back at yourself and be like “wow, I’m DIFFERENT.” People aren’t the same at 16 as they are at 15, or 17 and 16... as you get older your maturity sort of solidifies. But at 15, even a mature 15 yo has no business with a 23 yo. I swear. I promise this.

I smoke flower. Have a one hitter and take a few hits before bed or whatever. This is, from my experience, the best way to take CBD because you absorb more, it’s cheaper, effective immediately, etc. A bottle of 500mg CBD may cost $40, but 500mg CBD in flower costs like $10."
