food,ffef6z7,t1_ffe6igi,1579845713.0,"Personally, I'll pound out the chicken breasts so they're nice and even add a little oil, salt and pepper to each side, cook them on medium / high for like 4-5 minutes on each side until they're nicely browned. Once I'm fairly convinced they're cooked through, I'll take them off the heat and put them on to a cutting board. Slice up the veggies (well do this when the chicken is cooking), using the same pan add a little oil to the pan and toss in the veggies, cook to your preference. Turn the heat down low - slice up the chick and toss pieces back into the frying pan with the veggies, as well as whatever seasoning / sauce that your putting in (I normally use some fajita seasoning, some powder, little water and oil, mix it in), let it simmer at low until everything has come together nicely and your good to go. Grab some fajita shells, whatever toppings ya want and your ready to rock.

Just another note - those fajita seasoning packets that you see in the stores - make sure you don't just pour the whole packet in without checking how much chicken it's good for. Even at that, I'd use a little less otherwise it can be a little overpowering. But the more ya make it, the better you'll be able to adjust."

Wild boar is a darker meat, more like a cross between pork and beef - usually a little richer in flavor. 

Keep in mind that farmed, and wild boar meat will taste different too... farmed animals provided for the most part a grain / grass diet, they're harvested at a particular age, at a particular time of year to get a somewhat predictable harvest quality.  Wild boar is like rolling a dice, boils down to time of year, age, diet of the particular boar."

AskReddit,ff6f3hx,t3_erstu3,1579625817.0,"I sleep naked. I haven't had to deal with fire or murderers... I did end up with a visitor one night though...

So it was a summer or two ago, hot as hell outside. It was evening, I was at my computer and I had opened the double patio door beside me, and drew the screen closed and locked. Couple hours later, bed time. I queued up an episode of American Dad or something to listen to before falling asleep. Kill the lights, crawl into bed and go about setting my alarm for the next morning. 

As I'm doing so, I noticed a shadow flicker in my room that wasn't really consistent with the going ons in the room. I put my phone down and watch... There it goes again, shit. I've got one of those monster moths in my room. Ah well, that'll be a tomorrow prob... Fuck that's a REAAAALLY big moth. Shit is that? Yep, it's a bat.

So first things first, lets confirm it's a bat. This things doing loops around my room - and the last thing I want is to get smacked in the face by a bat, so I crawl out of my bed down onto the floor and crawl over to my light still naked and feeling a little exposed obviously. Yep it's a fucking bat. What the - how did it... ugh. OK so now what. OK well, I don't want this guy getting out of my room, so I crawl over to the door and crawl out shutting the door behind me and contemplate just going to sleep on the couch. Nah I can't do that, I'll never find the thing again. An idea strikes and I walk into my spare room that's got all my fishing and outdoor gear to retrieve my trout net. It's this small handheld fishing net that has a diameter of about 28""... Perfect. If this doesn't work I can go get the 52"" carp net...

So I sneak back into my room shutting the door back behind me, time to face off with this thing. So the lights on, theres a ceiling fan in the middle of my room which is spinning, and the bat is doing laps around the outside the fan range - right about face height... Perfect. So I've got one hand on my balls, the other on the net - priorities right? I spend a little time watching how this things moves, get the net ready, and miss. Little fucker dodged my net. I stop, I watch a bit - try again annnnnd miss. This went on for a minute or two - one would almost think this guy had radar or something... Another try or two, finally netted the little guy. I flip the net gently so that the bat can't fly out, and while on my way to the living room balcony I grab a pair of boxers off floor and pull those up. Make it to the balcony, release the little guy... and spend the next 2 hours trying to fall back asleep."
