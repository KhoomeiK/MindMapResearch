politics,ffu9j7x,t1_fftfei0,1580237325.0,"Well two things: 1) there's no definitive smoking gun that proves that Huawei is spying on its clients, all that is ever really gone off of is that the have closer ties to the government. Which, lets be real, is basically every US tech company as well. 
2) Huawei is the most competitive bid on the market right now, and Trump and telecom companies will not lower their bids to make their competitive. 

So as the UK, you're literally paying a premium on unfounded allegations. Mind you its more or less proven with the Snowden leaks that that the US has leaned on telecom companies before to spy on individuals."
politics,fftdggk,t1_fftc8tt,1580217281.0,"Yeah, it's not like the US has an active spy program that included bugging the phones of their international allies or anything. 

The issue you you run into with this is that the US's agenda is also self serving as well. Trump (and Obama before him) are basically telling other countries to not bu the cheaper product and to pay US companies more instead."

worldnews,fenupzt,t1_fenu784,1579291105.0,That's fair but having their own currency and fiscal policy will probably end being an exception that will have to be made if Britain joins again. Half the EU has already learned the hard way that giving up control of currency and rates to Germany is a very losing poposition.
worldnews,fenuhem,t1_fen1nre,1579290961.0,"I think it'll depend on the state of the country. If Britain chugs along fine after Brexit, it'll be a hard pill to swallow if the country begs to join the EU with less terms than when they left."
