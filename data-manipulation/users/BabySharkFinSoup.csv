However, reacting and sensing where to go is more important.  You have to have a read on your opponent.  And some fighters can read others better.  It’s why watching tape is so important in sports.

Plenty of photojournalist share personal images, and plenty of people throughout history have taken near death photos of their loved ones.  And many photojournalist are freelance, ie their boss is themselves and they quite literally sell photographs for money...just because it’s not a lot of money doesn’t change the fact that it’s profitable.

But a realistic account from a husband on the impending death of his wife is suddenly too much for the internet.  This is what death looks like for many, and it is their story to share.  I get it may not be everyone’s choice to share something this intimate and difficult, and that is totally fine and understandable.  But some people heal by opening up, sharing an honest look into the difficulties, being able to relate to others....and that’s totally okay too.

ETA: Also, why is it acceptable for photographers to profit off images of the suffering or death of others, but it’s wrong for someone to simply share their own journey?   Surely making money off suffering is worse than someone just opening a window into their life.
