Jazz,fezpy61,t1_feyj8gd,1579460188.0,"Playlists tend to concentrate on the hits of an artist and you never get to hear the other tracks.  CDs are fine but one of its benefits ends up being a negative. Put a CD in and it will take up 40+ minutes of time.  I have found many albums that require repeated listenings.  

Records are about 20 minutes a side.  Repeated listenings are much easier and flipping over a record is not that much of an imposition. If I am 25 minutes into a CD and still not  enjoying it I have to make the conscious decision to stop the CD before it is finished. I feel guilty doing that. And once I have done that it is likely I will not listen a second time. I've missed out on repeat listenings.

But most important of all to me is the sound quality.  I prefer analog. Many people prefer digital. Vinyl definitely sounds different. Maybe it relates to an anti-digital article by Roger Ebert from 1999. ""Hollywood has not spent a dime, for example, to research the intriguing question, do film and digital create different brain states? Some theoreticians believe that film creates reverie, video creates hypnosis; wouldn't it be ironic if digital audiences found they were missing an ineffable part of the moviegoing experience?""
