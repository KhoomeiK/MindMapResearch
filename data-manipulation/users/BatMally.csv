If you’re only a high school graduate, or worse, a dropout, work no longer pays. If the federal minimum wage in 1968 had kept up with inflation and productivity, it would now be $22 an hour. Instead, it’s $7.25.

And those zipcodes and their residents have been *pillaged* by corporate America. Via legal bribery and regulatory capture, the wealthy have turned the economy into a heads we win, tails you lose proposition for themselves.

Or even something as simple as believing in science.

Sure, they love to trot out the cost of human trials, but that old cannard isn't really true. The avg cost of human trials is in the millions, not billions (another lie big pharma loves to trot out) and they even recoup quite a bit of that through tax breaks and even direct payment from the US government.

Regulation probably *saves* big pharma more than it costs them. Pay attention to the lawsuits they encounter when they fudge their numbers and release a dangerous drug.

I swear I've never heard worse excuses for bad behavior than what I hear from big pharma. Bitching about R&D costs. Fuck you. R&D is the *entire reason for their fucking existence*. It's insane.
