I had a guitar teacher who was 69 but talking to him was if I was talking to someone who was half his age. Some of my best friends are having more fun in their 30's than their 20's.

When your out and about shopping, make an effort to talk to employees, male or female. Cashiers, managers, stockers, whatever. Just learn to make small talk with people.

This will carry over when you talk to girls because I'm sure your anxious or nervous of talking to them. The only way to get better at that is to talk to girls that make you nervous. Whether it's asking them out or just talking.

What got me through this, started off as a very shy guy with no social skills. Then I worked at Kohls and Wal-Mart as simple stockers. That will force you to work on your social skills like nothing else. Tackling it day in and day out. It will be uncomfortable for a bit but if you can expose yourself to those situations....Your brain will catch onto patterns. You will stutter, blank mind, embarrass yourself, say the wrong thing, etc. Hell I still do these occasionally but it makes me laugh! That's all necessary for you to get better. Failure is how you get good.

What kind of job do you have? Because if you don't have a job where your constantly surrounded by people, then you going to need to do some of this stuff on your own or get a different job. Believe me, It took me almost 3-4 years(I was a slow learner) before I was confident in my social skills but it shouldn't take that long for anyone else.

Late in life? your not late at all man. I got started at 25-26 and still improving. How do you date girls? Ask them out. Whether that's see a cute girl as your out and about and just walk up to her and compliment her and ask her out vs a wingman introduces you to someone. Whatever the method. What changed for me, start doing things that scare the shit out of you. If it's simply talking to girls, go out shopping or something and just make small talk with a few girls around you. If it makes you nervous, do that thing. Try it 100 times if you need to, cuz I can almost guarantee that anyone who wants to get good has only asked out a few women or done these kinds of things a few times. Ask out 25 girls and get used to rejection. Expand your comfort zone enough times and you'll be surprised at what happens.

This kind of goes without saying, you want to make sure your the best version of yourself, take care of your body, your appearance, hit the gym, learn some good habits, keep your mind active. Conquer your fears, the more confident you are the better your luck with women. They pick up in that shit instantly. So it's like a domino effect. 

When I decided to do a bunch of hard shit and stick it out, lifting when it got uncomfortably heavy, failing repeatedly, tackling my fear of heights by going on the slingshot, skyscraper and then skydiving. Bit extreme but it was extremely uncomfortable and very new to me. The more shit I did like this, the more people responded to me and notice me much more than ever. Where as most people avoid discomfort...I get used to it and push through. 

It's going to take a lot of work but if you stick with it, your entire life change! Don't try to tackle 5 areas of your life all at once, focus on one at time and get that area up as much as possible and then move on to the next area.

TL;DR Do shit that scares you, become more confident! Magic happens. Sounds kind of cheesy, it does go against the grain from what society tells us to do but I've found that it works so much better than anything else."

Your smile is lovely and just I can tell just looking in your eyes that your a very sweet and kind woman. Keep your head up! Also noticed the My Hero Academia poster in the background, HIGH-FIVE!"

I've solved a few programming problems from CodeWars and Hackerrank. Also started dabbling into Unity tutorials since it supports C# which is nice. Beyond that though, not too much.

That's true, I haven't really looked at that many certifications at my community college besides the Computer Science degree itself. It's just that my previous experience of college was 4 years ago and I had a different mindset back then. Even though I know what it takes now that I've worked like hell to get my license, my car, and experienced a ton of other milestones, I'm afraid of going back. Which might be what I need to do."

AskReddit,fe64u0n,t3_enut7n,1578881810.0,"Back when I worked at Wal-Mart overnights, there was a female co-worker that I had my eyes on and I thought she was very beautiful. She was my best friends sister, I was 25 and she had to of been like 21-22? Her brother/my best friend is 9 years older than me and love him to death. I asked her out over facebook messenger twice because I wanted to date her. Rejected twice. which I was fine with until one day I was talking to a co-worker who was into weightlifting and we were talking about bench press. She over hears it and just straight up looks me in the eye and says ""YOU bench press?!?! HAHA!"" essentially laughing in my face, which at the time I was Squating, Benching, overhead Pressing and dead lifting but my body didn't show that I lifted...Despite Squating 180-200 pounds(not high lifts but decent). My heart sank after I heard that and I don't think I've ever talked to her since. now of course not even a week or two later she gets into a relationship with another guy who is skinny like me but is taller and probably comes from a good family. So she had options and I didn't which sucked. At the time, she had everything I wanted in a woman, Red hair, big boobs, nice ass, hour glass figure, bubbly personality. Every guy has eyes on her and I don't think she understands why, she probably thinks that everyone is super nice to her but in reality....lol Every guy wants to get in her pants because she is very attractive.

After that, I still feel that pain and that pain pushed me in my lifting, made me want to strive for girls way hotter than her. In fact, I did have sex with a woman who in my opinion was way hotter than her."

While most of us men don't have anything to offer until we're in our mid to late 20's and beyond. Like we get better with age but we have to EARN every single bit to attract the opposite sex while women are just handed beauty on a silver platter. The irony is most have no idea on what to do with beauty so it's poorly spent(some learn early though). Now of course, not every woman is like this but from what I have seen, so many people that I knew have peaked in HS and aren't doing anything with their lives while I'm just getting started."
