gardening,ffcn3hb,t1_fesvs4j,1579802963.0,"Thank you. The two videos are very helpful.

So if I'm not mistaken, during the process of repotting, I loosen the rootball or cut some off to the point where oil soil can be easily removed (maybe won't like a rootball anymore and kinda look like the roots of an immature plant, but with longer roots) and then do the standard repotting procedure. What I'm worried is that not all roots are as strong as they appear, some of them are very fragile and thin which can fall off very easily. Is there a need for concern? or it's fine as long as the main roots remain intact?

I chose Pothos because I like how it looks (I prefer green instead of colourful houseplants) and beginner friendly (as you said, they are extremely tough). I used to have a really small cactus and they required totally different environment and treatment. I'm not getting any direct sunlight so I can't grow a cactus in my new flat"

So would you say that they prefer human contact more? I guess they're not as easy to get scared, is that right? Less active means they don't spend their time on the wheel as often yes? and probably sleep more?

Haha I won't blame you dw. All personalities are ok for me. I consider this my fate, you know? Like what kind of bond does god want me to have with my hamster, and I'll adjust my attitude towards the hamster accordingly."

Oh so basically I skipped one step straight to dwarfs haha. Yeah I don't have a problem with getting a baby male. Currently, my male hamsters are friendlier. The female one ignores me most of the time and only come to me when there's treats lol. I know this has nothing to do with gender, I just happened to have them like this.

Yeah I'm gonna get a very big aquarium if I can find it, or I'll probably merge two into one, not sure yet. I want to respect the elderly so I'm not gonna get a new one just yet.

I agree. Anxiety disorders are all about your perception on certain things that make you anxious. If I can tune down that perception a little bit, I might be able to force myself to break through that wall.

I actually know that people don't really care about what I do but my brain says it differently. I need to be able to control my thoughts and the way I think so I can step out of this downward spiral. Yeah, you're right, it's gonna take time but I'll make sure to plan my journey of recovery."

Anxiety,fezbdhx,t1_fetsy2p,1579455658.0,"Yeah I agree that the inside factors (self confidence, insecurities etc.) are far more important than the outside factors (how I look). I also have social anxiety so it's a bit challenging for me to join a group or an organisation to feel surrounded by peers with the same interest. Everything is related and I think my depression also has some effect on my anxiety as well.

It's good advice. Surrounding yourself by the right people can be life changing. You might even find friends or potential relationships but it's really hard for me to do that at my current mental condition. Might have to work on something less difficult first and then go back to your plan. Good plan, thanks for the reply"

Yes I've heard about exposure therapy. The more you do something out of your comfort zone, the easier it gets. However, this method doesn't have that much effect on me personally. Instead, I feel more anxious because I doubt myself why I can't do this after so many attempts.

Meds are helping but they are not a permanent fix. I'm discussing this with my counsellor as well, maybe I'm doing the exposure therapy thing wrong. I'm gonna ask my counsellor for some advice regarding that.

Anxiety,fez91r2,t1_fetd9ew,1579454976.0,"Yes. People mind their own business especially where I live. With social media, I think people are more accepting that people take photos everywhere they go. It's just that one second glance when you hold up your phone and people look kinda surprised. They probably just don't want to be in the photo but my mind can't help but interpreting that as me being weird.

Thanks for the encouragement."
gardening,fesdg65,t1_fejotul,1579364096.0,"Understood. One size up, I'll remember that. I'm kinda worried about repotting in the future because this pot I bought is actually taller than the standard pots they sell. I'm afraid that the rootball will become too tall and repotting kinda lose its purpose because I may not be able to buy a bigger tall pot and therefore less room for the plant to grow more (which is one of the reasons of repotting right?)

Is there like a ratio on how much soil you put in the pot before putting in the rootball and then how much soil you put on top/side? Otherwise it'll look like the plant is shrunk inside the pot (Should've asked this before my first repot)

I've repotted it after I bought it and you said it was the standard way of repotting. For future reference, if the rootball is surrounded by so many roots, it'll be very difficult to loosen it up and replace the compact, old soil inside the rootball. Tearing it open will become a disaster. What am I supposed to do in that situation?

Yeah I'll try to do the weight measurement method with the finger method to make sure I don't mess up. It'll probably take me years of practice but it's worth the time.

Yeah I could tell you're so passionate about plants from the very beginning. I was born in 1995 so I was more into phones, Internet and stuff in high school+ my parents didn't want houseplants so this is kinda a new territory for me.

I asked that question mainly because you replied so many times with so much information and details. Are you very interested in teaching others about what you know? Considering you're the only person who replied to my post. Even if someone answered, they wouldn't bother answering questions soooo many times.  I apologise if I cause you any inconvenience.

That's why I owe you a massive thank you."
gardening,fej8wtb,t1_fe4k7zz,1579161989.0,"Good news. I found 2 very hidden spot on the edge of the pot for me to the finger test, really had to focus and find it cause the leaves are all covering the edge. 

One thing that's worth mentioning about the test is that soil seems naturally cool to touch so it's sometimes confusing if the soil is cool or SLIGHTLY moist. Is there a set definition on dryness? Does it mean that the soil has to be in sort of dust form and/or without anything sticking to your finger? I found one single leaf that turned completely yellow (I know you said one leaf doesn't mean something bad) but I would like to make sure that I get the basics right and not the culprit of a disaster. 

I'm not gonna do it now but as the plant gradually grow and needs repotting (next year or two I presume), is it a good idea to buy a 2 sizes up of a pot rather than a standard, recommended 1 size up? That way it'll make the finger test so much easier. I know experienced houseplant owners can tell if the plant is dry just by feeling its weight but I'm not that experienced as you can tell already. 

I know I'm treating my pothos like a baby but I'm just committed to let it  thrive as long as possible, it a sense of responsibility if that makes sense. You mind if you tell me if you're a full-time gardener or someone that's very passionate about plants? You're very knowledgeable.

Thank you"
gardening,fe39sus,t1_fddy9zb,1578847292.0,"Thanks again

Okay I won't use the hairpin method then but it'll take a very long time to reach that step anyway. We'll be getting a consistent 90%+ humidity in Spring, sometimes 100% so it's fine for it to grow, still won't use that method though. We have a sub-tropical climate.

The biggest problem right now is that it's really challenging for me to do the finger test. The stems are everywhere, even round the edge of the pot. As you said,

>  equivalent of moist forest soil (use a mix of equal parts peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite) 

which is the case for this plant but the soil seems so compact (3-month new soil). The only possible way for me to do the test was at the edge of the pot where there's nothing there but the stems are everywhere even around the edge of the pot and I don't want to force my finger into the soil and potentially damage the roots of the cuttings. Last time I risked it and forced one finger in and the soil was moist like 2 inches down (well the plant dying would be so much worse than me risking it) so it's good for now but it's not good to do that every time, both to  the plant and to my finger. I consider this a weird case because I've never seen this problem anywhere both in real life and on the web.

Yeah I agree, we have a lot of pothos grown near our apartment building but I've never thought about them as being unnecessary or ugly and stuff. I quite like the pattern. I don't take the plant less seriously because of it's too common, just like I wouldn't destroy a patch of grass just because it would grow back quickly."
depression,fe3486e,t1_fdscna3,1578845795.0,"There may be too many drugs but the doses of all the meds are very low. My psychiatrist said that he needs to stablise my mood by increasing motivation, eliminate the person in my brain and take  Clonazepam if necessary to control my anxiety. 

He said that he didn't want to up the doses too much because they would make me sleepy and stay at home all day which is against his goal.

He also cannot up the dose of my antidepressant because I have history of fainting due to serotonin level, so in order to make up for it, he added another ""supplement"".

When I was hospitalised because of fainting, a psychiatrist evaluated the meds and said it was logical for my psychiatrist to prescribe those meds...so I don't know what to believe. I wouldn't dare to stop taking some of them myself cause I'm worried about withdrawl"
depression,fdrhwfg,t1_fdre3xp,1578684693.0,"Thanks for the reply.

I asked my psychiatrist if I could take reduce the doses because they've been making me very sleepy

I was feeling suicidal when he prescribed some of those meds and he already tried reducing the doses, and then the feeling of depression and suicidal thoughts worsened. After that, he increased the doses back to normal immediately and said the doses couldn't be reduced until my mood becomes more stable

Even now that you think that I'm over medicated, I still feel really depressed all the time, like my brain is constantly telling me to end my life but the meds worked before so my psychiatrist decided to stick with the combination. 

I'm also not very good with serotonin-related meds, some antidepressants that got me hospitalised before so his options are quite limited"

Unfortunately, because of my living conditions, I can't put my pothos outdoors which is sad because I really wanted to take care of a huge bushy pothos. It's a huge achievement and responsibility

But I assume it's still possible to make it look kinda bushy but small (even very small) indoors right? 

> So you achieve this by breaking it down periodicaly 

Do you mean that I break down a vine into cuttings and just accumulate more cuttings to put into the pot to give it more of a bushy looking eventually? I've also heard that some people use hairpins and pin the vine into the soil to make long vines look kinda bushy? If your method (if I didn't misunderstand) sounds good, then I prefer to stick with your method.

Yeah I've read about pothos being a ""lazy person's treasure blah blah blah"" before I purchased the pothos. I'm the type of person who likes to take things precisely and seriously so it's not a problem in terms of moisture.

Ah good. I managed to learn something from watching a few YouTube videos. I'm eager to learn more because I like natural, calmness, green and the sense of responsibility. I developed this interest when I was in high school but my parents were against it at that time haha. I'm in my mid 20s now, I probably should've started learning sooner but I guess hopefully I'll have 60+ years to make up for it haha

Yes, my ultimate goal is to grow it until it gets bushy and huge like this ([https://youtu.be/mBmeOL0AHkY?t=349](https://youtu.be/mBmeOL0AHkY?t=349)) \[It's a different species I know\]. I know it's most likely not gonna happen considering my experience but it's worth a try.

A video, the above one actually, says that in order to make it look bushy, I have to cut the long vines and by doing that it'll make the plant grows upward and bushy. Is that what you mean by ""stop every so often, cut it up into cuttings, and then combine with the)? After that sentence, I'm confused when you say the term ""parent plant"" because you say that it's a potful of root cuttings thus not a single plant. How do I know which one is the parent?

So to achieve my goal, splitting the pothos sounds like that would be doing the opposite of that. If I want to do that, do I use a totally different approach from what  you mention here?

>What is your potting mix formulation?

The potting mix is just a regular store bought all purpose potting mix without any nutrients whatsoever. Thanks for the tip about watering, that's reassuring.

It raised my concern because the stems are very dense even around the edge of the pot so it's really difficult for me to do the finger test, at least without the risk of damaging some the roots

So the soil is actually only like two months old but I noticed that it's really compact for my finger to reach down. The soil is moist at the moment, about a week after watering. It's so compact that it felt like rubber so I had to kinda use a bit of force to check the moisture

One additional question: As you know, I have to move the stems and leaves to what it's like down there and do the finger test. Will moving them with the back of my hand cause any damage to the plant if I do it too often? I'm asking that because I've heard that some plants don't like to be touched.

Thank you and sorry again for not responding haha. I probably missed the notification."

google,fd21f4z,t3_ejkht1,1578140162.0,The swiping gestures still exist on Android 10 but they also added a new sets of gestures that integrate all the left and right swipe features in the middle swipe. Kinda like you only get a home button on iPhones and you swipe left or right instead of pressing the back button. You can choose between 3 different ways of navigation

I usually go to the huge computer store nearby instead of buying stuff online, things are cheaper than what you get online, believe it or not. I don't have a lot of trust in aliexpress either unlike Amazon.

I don't think I need bluetooth anymore considering I have ""normal"" stereo speakers instead of a JBL flip 3. The AC88 is very popular and it gets a lot of good reviews so that's why I put that in my shopping list.

But I'll definitely do some research on those two cards so I won't regret buying anything

Thanks"

I'm getting 4x the speed with my current USB adapter (which is supposed to be slower than PCIE cards) than the AC58BT. I'm thinking if I should try to fix the issue or get an upgrade. My router doesn't support wifi 6 anyway.

Thanks for the information though"

galaxys10,fcqzkko,t1_fcqmm0j,1577894562.0,"Yeah that sucks. I really liked that sound, especially when the others were kinda crappy

I think they just thought the updated sound suits its name better but in reality no one cares about the name of it. It also sucks because you can't add your own.

Well I'm not very certain about the battery drain part, maybe I just happen to look at the percentage more often haha because battery issues are kinda common after a big software update like this one

Apps (like discord or Gmail) with side menus on the left that you need to swipe to see are kinda problematic too, when you swipe left there is like a 90% chance it will go back instead of showing the hidden menu and I've tried all the sensitivity options. But I'm sure it'll improve when those apps become more compatible with the gesture.

Well to be honest, other than those problems I'm really enjoying this update, especially the gestures and the animations. Everything looks so smooth."

There is like a 20~40min awake time during the time I spent playing with my phone on my bed and it counted as ""awake"" which is good.
I don't understand how the GW manges to know if I'm on my bed or not lol, seems spooky haha"

I was talking about the period before you sleep, like the time you spend playing with your phone before sleeping lol but I get your point.
I have a 44mm. Similarly I get 10min or lower deep sleep but everything else lies within the normal range it suggests so I assume it's accurate in that aspect."

Although I can't be look things from  your perspective because I'm a local, People are pretty accepting to all races and the religion you believe in, people usually just mind their own business. You may be treated like Asians get noticed easily in the west, with no intention of racism. Especially if you're born in the 80s/90s/00s, you'll find yourself easier to make friends with the younger generations due to globalisation. Even if they were racist, they wouldn't say it out loud, it's a social norm.
