AskReddit,feqlre1,t1_feplmw5,1579343362.0,Ooh I loved dashboard confessional when I saw them last year. Yeah he was a little whiney but I didn't really mind. I just felt bad for him. Haha
ChoosingBeggars,fel6acd,t1_feerkgy,1579214972.0,I thought maybe it was some weird trans reference.

AskReddit,fdgi0jm,t3_ekt5n3,1578397645.0,"I work shifts and have this funny week where on Monday I start at 8.45am and then the rest of the week is 12.30 - 21.00. This week only happens once on a ten week rota. Guess who got a call from the big boss at 10.30am one Monday asking where I was. I am still a little annoyed they didn't call me earlier as I had to catch my time up. I'm quite trusted at work so they understood an honest mistake. All the managers thought I had agreed with a different manager to come in late for an appointment or something but no one knew, they just trusted me, until 10.30 when they thought it was a little odd."

fatlogic,fcxmcm4,t1_fcvyv4t,1578066388.0,Yep. I dissected a human in uni. Taking off the skin and fascia was easy and a delicate process. The student next to me had to hack away at the layers of fat just to get to the fascia cos their cadaver was obese. It was gross.
fatlogic,fcpvbx3,t1_fcoxaxl,1577872918.0,My dad got it. He didn't even realise he wasn't eating fruit and vegetables enough until he started getting sores on his legs that wouldn't heal!
fatlogic,fcmo728,t1_fcl4pgx,1577783935.0,Concerning morality - people should have a moral obligation to do what's best for their friends and family and that includes trying to be as healthy as possible. If they are healthy they will be around to see their children grow up and they will be healthy enough to play with them.
fatlogic,fcdv2rl,t1_fcatdl8,1577614119.0,"I was at work recently talking to a kind slim colleague. I am overweight, not obese and another colleague is obese. We were talking about food and the slim colleague starts saying sometimes it's medical, sometimes genetic etc. So I interrupt and say I know mine is cos I eat too much! I was worried about my obese colleagues opinion but she said the same, we both agreed we love food! The slim colleague was dumbfounded. Haha"
