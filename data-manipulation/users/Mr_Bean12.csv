NintendoSwitch,ffitgzh,t3_etphem,1579982304.0,"I got a new Switch. I have a few cartridges from a friend. When I put in the cartridge, it asked me to download an update. The games were - Mario Tennis and Overcooked 2. Here are my questions - 

1) Are those game patches released after the game was released?

2) I believe the patches get installed on my console?

3) When I return the cartridge, is there a way to clean up the patch space?"
