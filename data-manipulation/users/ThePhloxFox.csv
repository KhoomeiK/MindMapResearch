AskReddit,ffprv5j,t3_eu4uge,1580103469.0,Sometimes I use these nose strips to breathe better at night. They’re packaged similar to Band Aids. If you open one in the dark the glue separating will luminese making blue light. This never fails to fill me with joy!
bulletjournal,fdwhhny,t3_en6qil,1578758747.0,Another good one is “What is the most important step a man can take?”
fountainpens,fczx4zo,t1_fczlem2,1578110133.0,"What m800 nibs have you tried? I just got my first one with an EF, and while it’s ok I’m not in love. I’m considering getting a grind or saving up for a new nib to swap around."
facepalm,fctgdyz,t1_fct947v,1577942413.0,Seriously! It looks like it got termites.
fountainpens,fcrjjbs,t3_eil2e3,1577902643.0,Chili red!
fountainpens,fcok9xo,t1_fcnpohm,1577834355.0,Another one checking in! I didn’t realize there was such a crossover!
fountainpens,fcoihav,t3_ei9qlt,1577833033.0,That’s a really nice looking pen! The color is great.
fountainpens,fcnbyxz,t3_ei4jpt,1577808392.0,"Wow!! You must be so excited, that’s a bunch of really great stuff!!"
fountainpens,fcn72x7,t3_ei2mp4,1577804974.0,A beautiful pen with a beautiful drawing of a beautiful cat! This is really great :-)
fountainpens,fcn6988,t1_fcn0wlt,1577804370.0,"Another 7 pens, 5 at the nibmeister, 1 in the mail, and a Kanilea on order. I’ll make another post once they’re all in."
fountainpens,fcn65el,t1_fcn0m5q,1577804290.0,This one is the melted crayons. It reminds me of the Lisa Frank stuff I loved as a kid!
fountainpens,fcn61tq,t1_fcmk425,1577804216.0,That’s my newest pen! The M is much thicker than I expected but it’s incredibly smooth to write with.
fountainpens,fcmzr49,t1_fcmjzyk,1577798957.0,"Sounds like one of those is in my future, thanks!"
fountainpens,fcmyqtb,t1_fcmwxkt,1577797933.0,I never thought I would own it myself! It was a perfect storm of an unexpected bonus when someone was selling it on penswap.
fountainpens,fcmyivi,t1_fcmgl2b,1577797700.0,"With the grease I’m not having any leaks, but I’m sure it’s not designed for it. It started with a Bock nib, I don’t remember if it was screw on though. With the new housing it fits the 3776 nib perfectly.
  
The Namiki has a M nib, it’s very smooth!"
fountainpens,fcmy9jq,t1_fcmeppe,1577797426.0,"I have a 3776 sent to the nibmeister right now getting the grind I’m considering for this one, we’ll see how much I like it on there first!"
AmItheAsshole,fcmeu9c,t3_ehw713,1577772669.0,"NTA! I say that to my cat in front of my husband all the time, it’s just a turn of phrase!"
fountainpens,fcmee63,t1_fcme2q9,1577772232.0,"It’s really wonderful! It has an elastic bold nib, and I’m trying to decide if I want to get a grind on it..."
bulletjournal,fcme4th,t3_ehu4ms,1577771982.0,This is really lovely!
fountainpens,fcmdkvu,t1_fcmd1wu,1577771465.0,"My favorite has to be the Namiki followed closely by the Nakaya, but I honestly love them all. They each have their own personality and I find myself favoring one for a while and then switching off. For the nibs I used a housing from Flexible Nib Factory, and yes I eyedropper both pens. I found that a little silicon grease stops any potential leaks!"

fountainpens,fcmcl7d,t3_ehuxgg,1577770550.0,Honestly the Azure is my favorite out of all of them! If they sold it in the US I’d pick one up.
fountainpens,fcmbu6a,t1_fcmaz0c,1577769882.0,"Looks like Archer and Olive! I’ve been thinking of getting the same one. OP, how is the paper with fountain pens? Does it show sheen?"
fountainpens,fcmbb0l,t3_ehybj4,1577769422.0,"From left to right: Schon Pocket Six (with a Platinum 3776 nib), Aurora Optima, Namiki Moonlight Raden, Visconti Homo Sapiens, Pen18111 (with a Sailor nib), S.T. DuPont Shoot the Moon, Nakaya Cat Paradise, Pilot Vanishing Point, Pelikan m600."
fountainpens,fcmaizn,t1_fcm86dc,1577768745.0,"I’m switching over to Tomoe River paper this year. Rhodia is fantastic for normal pens and markers, but it just doesn’t show enough sheen. Tomoe River may take a bit to dry, but that’s what gives me the sheen I crave, and can be mitigated with the pen/ink you choose."
fountainpens,fcm7mfz,t3_ehpzbs,1577766356.0,Troublemaker Milky Ocean- it reminds me of watercolors.
fountainpens,fcm7a40,t3_ehq83k,1577766089.0,"I have the cover you linked in brown, and I use it everyday. The leather feels great and the quality is fantastic. I push it to its limits, but it can carry a lot. In the pockets on the left I have a pocket sized (hippo noto) notebook, some sticky notes, and a straight edge (from Galen). In the large pocket under everything on the left I have an A5 Tomoe River notepad. Then I can fit in 6 pens (4 normal, 2 oversized). And on the right in my bullet journal (I was using a Rhodia goal book this year). I even got a matching 10 pen case for the rest of my pen collection. I would absolutely recommend it."
notebooks,fck6v5j,t1_fck5mpb,1577718247.0,Nice! Bet that was hard to get ahold of.
bulletjournal,fcjd913,t3_eh9jsv,1577683628.0,I love the rate your day. Maybe I’ll try that.
fountainpens,fcj5hjb,t3_ehdhe8,1577677759.0,"I have the 3776 Galaxy! It’s really gorgeous, you won’t be disappointed. It will make you want more raden pens though!  
  
This year I put together my perfect pen collection, so unless there’s an amazing limited edition I don’t think I’ll be buying anything. My goal this year is to find each pen’s “soulmate” ink."
fountainpens,fcfp77c,t3_eh63v4,1577632398.0,Lovely! Where did you get them?
fountainpens,fcbd8dh,t3_egt5nq,1577585439.0,Lovely!
fountainpens,fc931sk,t3_eglxkq,1577546219.0,"Really fantastic collection! They’re all so interesting to look at, they have so much detail. You have a great eye for pens!"
fountainpens,fc6uwiz,t3_egblx1,1577490126.0,"It's a bit out of your budget, but I bought [this pen](https://www.iguanasell.com/products/namiki-tradition-origami-crane-fountain-pen-maki-e-fk-35-smt) (Namiki Origami Crane) as my first Maki-e and love it."
