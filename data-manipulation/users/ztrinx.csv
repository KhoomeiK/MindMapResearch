Depends. You can pick any movie in the world and I can find flaws with it. Doesn't mean they are valid. And I certainly don't consider your objections valid, since your suggestions would make the movie suck or at least way less iconic. 

But as you said, that's fine, people like different things."

IAmA,fdjiuug,t1_fdj1uns,1578472829.0,"Correct. The clinical studies back in the day proved regrowth or stop of hairloss on the crown/back of the head, which is why all brands state that. I think there wasn't an incentive for further studies after that, but I haven't read or looked at similar research bin years, so I could be wrong.

What I mean to say is that Minoxidil does seem to work for a receeding hairline in terms of stopping/slowing down hairloss (based on feedback from many users and myself, idk if there is actual studies to prove it). Some even indicate that they regrow a bit of hair. It is, however, impossible to regrow dead hair follicles, that requires a transplant. 

TL;DR you cannot regrow your hairline with minoxidil/ attain your previous hairline before it started to receed."

Have used minoxidil for 8 years. It works. Results will always vary depending on genes and state of the hair before you begin to use it. But it definitely isn't some wonder magic drug."
IAmA,fdet0mt,t1_fde8j5e,1578345989.0,"1. Finasteride
2. Minoxidil

In that order in terms of effectiveness. Finasteride is not for everyone and can have side effects. But can be extremely effective for some men, especially when used early on.

Note, you cannot really stop a receeding hairline ones the follicles are dead. That requires a transplant."

Yes, mostly. 

>What treatments actually have some level of success?

1. Minoxidil
2. Hair transplant 
3. Finasteride

The big three, and they actually work. The better your hair and the sooner you begin, the better. Minoxidil is always a good start and requires little thought. 

>What factors determine if someone is suitable for follicle transplants?

You can easily get a free consultation by a good expert, which you should, if you want to go in that direction. A receeding hairline with a dense and good amount of doner hair in the back is usually suitable. 

And do not even think about going to a cheap/ offshore doctor."
IAmA,fderjby,t1_fde8i9n,1578345111.0,"No, it will not. There is however no reason to wash your hair daily. Conversely, not washing your hair also wouldn't lead to hair loss."
IAmA,fder5j8,t1_fdecmc9,1578344885.0,">The best way to help slow/stop it is: 

>1. Healthy diet, 

>2. Exercise consistently, 

>3. Attempt to lower your stress level

You have got to be kidding me. Those first three things will do absolutely nothing to slow/stop male pattern baldness. You are a disgrace. 

>4. Start with over the counter shampoos/conditioner/leave in products that are supportive of fighting the DHT (dihydrotestestosterone)

Yes, fighting DHT will ACTUALLY help. Use topical solutions like minoxidil foam, as most shampoos/conditioners that combat DHT are too expensive and ineffective. But if you have the money, use them too. 

5. Hair transplant

6. Finasteride 

The above is the only things that will actually help you against male pattern baldness.

EDIT: Unbelievable that I am actually being downvoted for stating the truth. Please provide me with a single piece of evidence to support the claim that you can stop/slow male pattern baldness via:

1. Healthy diet
2. Exercise consistently
3. Attempt to lower your stress level"

It is all genes, unfortunately. If you have male pattern baldness in your genes, the right food and healthy lifestyle will do nothing to save your hair."
IAmA,fdepwxt,t1_fdekrdv,1578344150.0,">If you already have a bald spot, it’s too late

It is indeed possible to only use it once a day. But results will always vary. Additionally, all things being equal, the better your hair/ the earlier you begin using it, the better your results."
IAmA,fdeoxov,t1_fdeahzx,1578343578.0,">Is minoxidil actually working?

Yes, it works. The liquid is a pain in the ass to live with, get the foam, and don't pay for the most expensive brand. 

It is, however, not magic. It cannot regrow dead hair follicles and you have to use it every single day; twice a day is the recommendation, and best, but one may be just enough. 

>is it true that it cannot be used 4 hours before and after the hair was washed? 

Never heard that one, no. Use it every morning after a quick hair rinse in the sink."
