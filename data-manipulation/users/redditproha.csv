OutOfTheLoop,ffy4wpr,t1_ffy2vca,1580338608.0,"This is my pet peeve. In every day use it's acceptable but not in scientific use. So it's better to use it in its scientific context when talking about science otherwise it becomes very easy for the general public to conflate the term. The original comment wasn't referring to a scientific theory but they were using it in a medical science context. 

In context and relation to this discussion, I'm thinking about climate change and how people are quick to claim ""it's only a theory"". Using the terms properly helps to quell this argument.
