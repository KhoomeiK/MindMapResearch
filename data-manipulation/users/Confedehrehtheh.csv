They're four of the legendary lords available in Total War so I bet that's where this was made initially."

ageofsigmar,ff3ouyc,t1_ff3ig7n,1579545671.0,"Thanks! I wanted robes that could use a color for any great clan easily, but still had a heavy Pestilens feel. Purple for sores and wounds, and a good color for cloth on other things too"

instantkarma,ff3ho12,t1_ff3c74j,1579541247.0,"That makes me so sad. My little guy is a rescue, found him in the hood of my truck, and this is the first time I've ever been glad he's terrified of the front yard. He refuses to go out there but he'll chill in the back all day long if it's warm and sunny. I'm sorry about your kitty."

The scheme is the same across all of them, but this guy has the most variation in color between the sword, robes, eye, and fur. Base is still WIP but it might stay the basic muddy look since I don't really want to get too into it for another billion of these guys."

educationalgifs,fdifisf,t1_fdi22lo,1578441744.0,"Does it though? Knowing that the last L is a silent consonant, the word is pretty distinctly separated into three syllables. If anything the english pronunciation violates those rules as there isn't really a way to pronounce ""tl"" on its own. The combination pretty much always comes when the t is a part of another syllable, consonant combination, or adding ""ly"" and creating an adverb.

Edit: To be clear, I am genuinely curious. It's not a distinction that really makes sense to me considering the origin of the word. It feels like the same situation as ""bologna"", another really weird English pronunciation."
educationalgifs,fdiejzc,t1_fdi81oq,1578441121.0,I've got family from Texas and have never been north of the Bible Belt or west of the Mississippi myself. Not once have i ever heard someone pronounce taco like that without intentionally mispronouncing it.
educationalgifs,fdhze9o,t1_fdhyk0v,1578432952.0,"But it's not an English word. Taco should be pronounced tay-coh by ""normal"" English rules(because those are super consistent right) yet nobody that isn't goofing around is going to say it like that."

dragonage,fdc9hpx,t1_fdc7loj,1578269755.0,Yeah I'm probably just overlooking something simple like that. I avoid using guides for anything but I was super sure that I had the correct answer and I just hadn't started a quest or something and wanted to see what was wrong.
dragonage,fdc29kf,t1_fdbvqym,1578265676.0,"Xyex is correct. This is about how no finish button, codex entry, or laser would show up. There has to be something I'm missing because I followed a step by step for one of them and it still didn't work. However another did so clearly I'm just a big dumb dummy"
dragonage,fdc1xnz,t1_fdbsizr,1578265493.0,"Yes. I matched my solution to the one that shows at the bottom and I saw nothing different between them. I was confused so I did it again with a guide online, which was the same solution as mine and nothing happened. Which makes no sense to me but I might just be blind"
dragonage,fdbfkym,t1_fdbedlt,1578256881.0,After I posted this I went and did one of them in Storm Coast again and it gave me a constellation and finish button so clearly something went wrong with the others. Not sure how since I was following a step-by-step guide which confirmed my first attempts so who knows.
dragonage,fdbfkhe,t1_fdbdatw,1578256877.0,I completed one in the Hinterlands and then two in Storm Coast. After I posted this I went and did one of them in Storm Coast again and it gave me a constellation and finish button so clearly something went wrong with the others.

2007scape,fcs8iv2,t1_fcs2f0g,1577912946.0,"There's a pretty common phrase taught in machine learning courses that fits nicely here:
Trash data in, trash data out."
ageofsigmar,fcpad97,t1_fcp8q9m,1577856042.0,"That would kind of be the equivalent to keywords in magic. Things like Flying, Deathtouch, etc.

I'm talking about specific wording. For instance in Warhammer sometimes the term ""Complete a move"" is used. Intuitively I would think that means the movement phase, but it can actually mean any kind of move. Pile-in, charge, movement phase, destruction allegiance ability, whatever.

Going back to the MTG example I gave initially, in the rules the word ""When"" or ""Whenever"" immediately implies a trigger, something that uses the game's stack and can be responded to. And that is consistent always. If you see those words, it's a trigger. Warhammer doesn't really have that from everything I've seen."
ageofsigmar,fcnwutl,t3_eg2xp7,1577820041.0,"Maybe it's just me and my inexperience on the tabletop, but Warhammer in general feels like it could really use a rules-wording pass like MTG had years ago. There shouldn't be room for interpretation when it comes to rules and things should make intuitive sense imo.

For those that don't know, early cards in Magic the Gathering had very strange wordings and rules were established on a card-by-card basis. In the late 90's they established Oracle and wordings became uniform across cards that would result in the same effect. They also made sure to give a rules meaning to the language. ""When ~this card~ enters the battlefield..."" and ""As ~this card~ enters the battlefield..."" mean two very different things. 

Coming back to AoS now there's issues with wordings that make things just frustrating for new players because they don't make sense intuitively. If I have a 4+ to hit, ""Reroll fails"" means you can't reroll a die that shows a 4 that fails because of a -1 modifier, which is dumb because intuitively the roll failed. More recent rules updates have done things like rerolling everything instead of only fails to get around that, but that shouldn't matter."
magicTCG,fcne006,t1_fcnaeax,1577809728.0,"Anyone that says this is entirely unplayable is fooling themselves for sure. Being blue is a pretty big upside, even if it's limited to enchantments. Especially in modern, acting as FoN fodder in modern while digging pretty deep for 3 mana is a big deal.

Purphory Nodes, Rest in Peace, Stony Silence, Suppression Field, On Thin Ice are all playable in some capacity."
magicTCG,fcn96vz,t1_fcmvpvm,1577806491.0,That's a horrible argument against 3 mana spells. Especially ones that fit into blue decks that can play force of negation.
