If they aren’t on the tables already then they are normally at a self service counter somewhere nearby."

DoesAnybodyElse,ffjt0r5,t3_etuwmh,1580006147.0,"I have curiosity issues so I feel like I have to know who it was knocking. My family don’t have to make appointments to see me, they can pop round whenever they like. I always check who’s there, if it’s an unwanted caller I just get rid of them quick. I don’t like my partner or children opening the door after dark though, if I’m working then they used to ignore it but now they check the door cam we had installed. I would say over 80% of unexpected knocks were welcomed after we saw who it was. We don’t get too many cold callers or random knockers where I live."

Quite a lot are mental health and some are very young children who are probably fine but the parents panic (done that myself) but occasionally we get cases such as your mum’s, more commonly over weekends when ambulances tend to be busier anyway."
