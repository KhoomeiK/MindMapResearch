And I dont mean structural issues, or safety problems with the construction I mean the quality of the finishing work, and the reliability of the appliances or heating/cooling system etc, are on the decline in pre builds, even the luxury ones.

And purpose built rental buildings are often different in subtle but inportant than ones intended for homeowner use.  
The main difference I see is that rental buildings will have electric baseboard heating. Contrast this with the homeowner unit, which has a forced air heat pump. Same with appliances, maybe the stove or microwave is  half size model, and the floor linoleum.
