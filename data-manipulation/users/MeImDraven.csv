People are never interested in things until they try them or atleast things that are similar.

Like if someone thinks fried eggplant tastes gross, but they've never tried it, then they don't ACTUALLY think fried eggplant tastes gross. You'll litterally never know unless you try and push yourself through it (This works with everything as long as the action isn't actually damaging to you)."
u_throwaway_xox_,fexml59,t1_fevvvzy,1579433294.0,"That is how I can tell you've never attempted to take care of a plant.

Nurturing something containing life which is innocent and fragile is actually the best way to remove loneliness. It shows you that you matter to it. It shows you that something as tiny as this one little flower/plant appreciates everything you do. It shows you that hard work pays off.

That being said, if you get plants, just don't overwater them, forget to water them, or remove them from the sun.
+if you live somewhere cold, get a hearty indoor plant or let it grow under a plant growing lightbulb.
++grow multiple seeds at once for the best results, because sometimes root-rot or bugs harm the plants

Cant knock it 'til you try it, eh.

(Me saying that isn't referring to using this thing as a means to feel needed, as in dependency, moreso as a way to show that you ARE truly not alone)"

Have you ever tried cooking? It is very fun; you fail the first few times, but after a while you get the hang of it. Sometimes you fail again and again and again and only disappoint yourself, but if you keep at it, through trial and error, you eventually become amazing. Some of the foods you love, others will hate. I love tteokbokki and Eastern European bread dumplings, my mom hates them. I love sushi, most of my friends hate it. I love rabbit, duck, and venison, maybe one or two of the people I know like these foods.
Keep doing your best and understand that its its good to be different. Go down your own path (+ make sure not to make others' paths more difficult than they already are).

Gardening is a lot of fun too, it shows you how difficult it is to do right compared to how easy it is to ruin it all. When your plant fruits/flowers/blooms, it shows you the benefits of doing right and trying your best."
