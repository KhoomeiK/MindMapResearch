>I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice;  ... ; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season.""

House costs are skyrocketing. So are food costs, transportation, education, energy, everything. But wages aren't.

They clearly state in the document that this decision is limited to the space a license plate occupies. They state that there is no rule against him putting his name literally beside that space.

I don't think we disagree? Some of the articles I found were definitely saying this was about any young person in treatment and I was more or less trying to preemptively defend against people that primarily read right wing blogs like that.

I could have expanded on it but even the idea that detransition rates reflect rates of regret is pretty lousy. From some of the worse articles I looked at makes me think that a lot of detransitioning is more about how the people around someone reacted rather than any internal regret.

The worst part of all of this is that I couldn't find a lot of positive articles, mostly just right wing hate rants passed off as journalism by some major outlets or criticisms of them.

Another question worth asking is ""Of all the people that began the process young, how many have regretted it?"". I can't find any good data on it. Some places are saying as low at 1%, some people are claiming as high at 85%. The studies that show higher numbers seem a little flawed, saying things like ""Kids that dropped out of the medical process have detransitioned"" which isn't really true, and ""detransition"" is different from regret anyway. Too many of the higher results I'm finding seemed to be largely reported on by disreputable sources like Metro UK or random sites that sound like ""freedom-of-libery-thought-journal.party"" so I'm suspecting it isn't nearly that high.

But if it was as high as 85%, then yeah we should be looking seriously at an age minimum. But if it's as low as 1%, or even 20%, we shouldn't block the majority because some people regret it. Doctors are pretty good and finding out when a treatment isn't right for a patient, and that type of filtering process probably makes up a bulk of that ""dropped out of medical treatments"" statistic. We're already heading in a pretty sound direction, throwing additional barriers is probably not what we need right now."

He seems like someone who earnestly believes he did something wrong, she seems like someone that got caught. Consider when they came forward, for Wylie it was pretty soon after Trump's election. For Kaiser it was after Wylie handed over all his evidence.

Looking at where they currently work should tell you all you need to know. Wylie works for H&M clothing stores, Kaiser works for a data collection firm that works with Donald Trump."
Documentaries,fdi28m5,t1_fdi0ytj,1578434432.0,">  but my entire life it has been called the Tulsa race riots

But that isn't even true. You used ""Up until 2018 it was known as the Tulsa race riots"" as your defense for calling it that. Sure, there was a vested interest in Whites calling it that, but others have been calling it the Tulsa massacre since it happened.

It's not about ""being in the wrong"" Christ. You were corrected and went on the defensive. You really think the name of something has no effect on the way people perceive the event? No, names matter. Word choice matters. A riot is a pretty bad way to describe it, and if you went your whole life calling it that and someone points out the error, your response shouldn't be ""well that's what I always called it so"".

Growing up in a place like America, you pick up racist views. Contrary to popular believe I don't think anyone holding on to them are automatically a card carrying racist. But when you are given a chance to confront those ideas, learn from them and change, lashing out and digging in your heals isn't a great look."

The major ""news"" networks (examples are CTV or CBC, similar to like NBC or PBS) are available for free as part of a very old deal that made the physical cable network private in the first place. In exchange for control over the formally publicly owned cable infrastructure they had to make their flagship stations publicly available, and they had to broadcast the news on those same stations.

Again, I was of the understanding that America had a similar deal. That would be a huge bummer if you guys lost that during the switch to digital. We get ~6 channels for free up here."
