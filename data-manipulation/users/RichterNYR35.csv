armstrongandgetty,ffkc2b4,t3_eu0ofa,1580020317.0,"> But am I crazy to think it's possible Marshall could have been forced out? The show started off the New Year not having a regular news cast without missing a beat; initially I thought Marshall may be replaced.

If you remember, it took them a while to find Hanson to replace Vince. It wasn’t the next day.

> The show does have a recent history of curious departures. Vincent left abruptly and A & G provided baseless reasons why on air.

The curious departures aren’t really a thing. You just need to remember that none of those guys work for Jack and Joe. They work for iHeartRadio, and the station. Vince made too much money. So the station let him go. Before him, Dominic broke the rules by using the Armstrong and Getty name to try to advertise his own personal podcast. He was worn by management, but he kept doing it.

> Knowing that A & G just renewed their contract, perhaps Marshall wasn't part of their future plans. Thoughts?

I think marshals departure has been in the works for a while. If you remember six months ago he started talking about putting his condo on the market. It was for a reason and now we know it. He’s probably just worked for a long ass time, what like 60 years in radio. I really do think he just retired."

I’ll have movers at my house moving everything out into a storage locker, and I’ll go to my cell phone provider and change my phone number and turn it to private so no one knows who has it. Other than that it’s easy because I don’t really talk to any of my family and I don’t have a whole Lotta friends.
