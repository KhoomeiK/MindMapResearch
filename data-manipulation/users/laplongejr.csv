""There's always one"" ? That's so obvious that I never thought about th...  
I KNOW WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH IT!!!  

In fact, it would be NOT only for gameplay purposes, but lore purposes too : by definition, the UEE can't communicate with a system with zero jump points, they can only know there's no known jumppoints leading to Oretani, right?  
What if ""a system can't have zero jumppoints"" wasn't not only a logic requirement, but a physical rule?  

In other words, when Oretani's entry point close, another one will open in Oretani... but from the exterior, there's nearly no chance to know where it will open as you would need to search in the whole universe.  
The only ""not insane luck"" method to know where the JP is would be to have a team in Oretani, ready to probe the next point.  

So Oretani was *never cut off from the exterior*, it was simply that nobody near the next JP noticed it before it closed off and that Oretanians never managed to contact UEE space.  
In 500 years, Oretanians could have explored a lot of systems we don't know anything at all, in such conditions it could have a mega-structure like in ""Valerian and Loreline"" with representatives of many races.  

Some uses from that I can think of : 

1) If there's always one jump point open *inside*, but opening/closing regularly, it could be used for random fasttravel...  
Like Stanton -> Oretani -> wait -> Sol  
Not really useful instead for people wanting to let the past behind them and wanting to explore unchartered space.  

2) Probably the most secure system for a military-oriented group, as after a while, there's no way to counterattack the people inside.  

3) Maybe a temporary Jump Point could be ""maintained"" by doing something important on the ""exterior"", imagine having to go to Vanduul space to break the anchor preventing Oretani to reconnect with the UEE later?"

In the 21st century, an unreliable contraception method shouldn't be used when you can, you know... not do the thing. It's the absolute last resort solution...  

[EDIT] Just read the list of counterindications, are they really *recommending* a 1% chance with a lot of conditions where it doesn't work at all? I'm stumped... There are 66 millions people in the UK, let's say a third are woman : if they used this method, that would mean 2 millions unwanted children!"

I was almost sad for them.  

When Alya talks about Magestia, she doesn't talk about a comic, she's talking about a person *really* busy fighting supervillains elsewhere! Nadia Chamak's report about a supervilain is not ""it's incredible that happens"", it's ""it's incredible they consider France a target"". And Marinette/Adrien already heared/watched superheroes on TV and have a slight idea about what a superhero war looks like...  

Extra points for the police not believing the superheroes can help despite the fact other countries do, in Bakerix Marinette's grandpa not considering Superheroes a part of his youth, etc."

Mind you, no new taxes were raised, it was simply harder to ""forget""  declaring some customers who paid without a card... since then, I never pay cash the first time I go somewhere, sadly that means no tips for the workers too.

Due to Belgian taxes, an employer pay a lot more than what the employee even receives, so it seems it's impossible to have correct quality at the price expected by the customers. :(   
So either you end with crap food, or you try to take as much inexperimented students as you can (not optimal service) ... and if you avoid both, you need ""the other way"" to lower prices..."

miraculousladybug,ff8i4so,t1_ff7iz1m,1579679538.0,"Remind me of a fix-fic and a reddit post noting that if the Eiffel Tower was destroyed several times per week by a supervilain able to interfere with *four* (or five) governments without problems to the point the *Police Nationale* was under the orders of the Mayor of Paris... Tourists would probably go elsewhere.  

FYI, here's the list of governments *attacked* by Hawk Moth.
Basically, the show won't never see him judged for his actions given the list of international crimes the poor guy has done... 
  
- France : we could list the whole show, but forceful control of government official (Rogercop,Maledictor) and unlawful declaration of independance (Darkblade) are already pretty bad things in almost all juridictions of the world... special awards goes to Siren and Frozer.  

- Kowar(FR)/Achu(US) : Rather obvious in hindsight, Princess Fragrance used *chemical weapon* on the Heir prince... I must agree I don't know much about Achu, but that doesn't seem the kind of thing you forget the next day.
- Egypt : Maybe the Pharaoh incident (my memories are unclear on this one)  
- Egypt 2 : *Future Hawk Moth* is lucky, nobody know about the degradation of archelogical remains caused when sending Bunnix in the past, ""before"" the Timetagger incident

- Italie : Rather subtile, can you remember why? Heroe's Day confirmed Lila ""Volpina"" Rossi is the daughter of a diplomat. Yup, that means that France accords her a special status... Applying mind control on an underage girl during her first day at school is not nice [\[^citation ^needed \]](https://xkcd.com/285/) , but having an official Italian delegation asking ""what the heck is this Butterfly guy?"" during France's next meeting must be extra awkward...

Those were the 4 direct victims of Hawk Moth, but two other governments are affected by the French Miraculous war...
- United Kingdom : Hawk Moth *accidently lost control* during the Startrain incident, resulting in collateral damage including Big Ben... it didn't last long but my headcanon is that a UK official got a weird day gathering informations from the other 3 countries.
- China? : The only one not a victim, but reanimating Feast resulted into the reappearance of the temple in Tibet... I'm sad for whoever France sends to the next UN security concil.

*Note that in Cat Blanc's timeline , the number of affected countries goes from 6 to 195, but I'm not really sure ""destroying the moon, threatening all live on Earth and nearly destroying the Universe"" fits into any currently existing law.  
This post is not given as legal councel as I'm not a lawyer.*"
