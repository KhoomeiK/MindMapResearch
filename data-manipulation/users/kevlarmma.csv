lego,ff2je3y,t1_ff2esit,1579508803.0,Which ones?? I haven’t tried the statue or Yoda yet but I’m having a ton of fun doing the Friends set. It’s been decades since I last built legos and it’s definitely becoming a new adult hobby!
facepalm,ff1rcpk,t1_ff1c2pe,1579484483.0,"Never mind, I see you’re faking to be a European and slamming socialism / anyone on the left in all your post history. Now I get why you can’t imagine someone speaking neutrally about a topic because you’re so much of an extremist."
facepalm,ff1r28b,t1_ff1c2pe,1579484305.0,Is that so impossible for you to imagine?
Tinder,ff1q8o3,t1_ff1mrj5,1579483770.0,"Trust me, OP is full of shit saying she responded and they’ve been talking. Girls hate this kind of shit — sexualizing the conversation like that and so quickly. 

There’s a reason OP shared it before her response... it’s because anyone that understands women will understand that this was low effort, creepy, and not attractive behavior."
facepalm,fezpol2,t1_feyzdjk,1579460099.0,"I got an angry phone call from a parent because I teach social studies and talked about impeachment with 100% bipartisan neutrality since I wanted the students to have a safe space to ask questions and talk about things without feeling judged or persuaded.

The parent said “12 year olds aren’t ready to talk about that yet” and I was just thinking “Bitch how do I think more highly about your own daughter’s maturity level and critical thinking skills than her own damn mother.”"

It’s this one! I’m building one or two sets this weekend but leaving the Yoda for students to work on when they’re stuck at school waiting for a parent to come pick em’ up."

SandersForPresident,fe5omfy,t1_fe5ii2r,1578872264.0,Didn’t Bernie not get the nomination in 2016? So your comment is pretty meaningless.

instantkarma,fe02777,t3_enf763,1578801226.0,/u/PJ09 please explain why this post was somehow allowed yet the OP of the content had their post removed by you for not being instant karma?

Credit to that person on Twitter doesn’t stop you from being a piece of shit for doing that."

nextfuckinglevel,fdtcr34,t1_fdsrz7a,1578714908.0,"I mean, a rockback & cross counter is risky but also one of the best moves I’ve personally used since it got me my only career knockout. (MMA though, not boxing or MT)

Plus, Conor McGregor is famous for his rock back cross counter. Good advice from little man at a beginner level but advanced fighters (like you probably are) can use a backwards slip to set up a banger of a shot."
nextfuckinglevel,fdtc502,t1_fdssl68,1578714663.0,"I found your comment on going to nationals and getting gold hard to believe so I wanted to fact-check, but after your first Trump post I decided “fuck it I like this dude and I don’t give a shit if his comment is true or not.” Lol"
WWE,fdt32gc,t1_fdszxfk,1578711275.0,Wow you are a straight up cunt. I was agreeing with you and you went full pussy ass bitch mode lmao
WWE,fdsxehs,t1_fds4s0s,1578709183.0,"I was an MMA fighter with a good few ammy fights and a pro fight before becoming a middle school teacher, and I’ve always had the same outlook on Pro Wrestling:

Yes, it’s fake. Yes, it’s fight choreography. But no, it’s not like a fucking dance routine and those guys take real and legitimate damage to their bodies that a lot of MMA fighters couldn’t take. Shit man, I’ve seen UFC fighters get fully KO’d by a fall on their head that some WWE dudes would just eat like a bowl of cereal.

I find it a bit disrespectful of wrestling fans to act like wrestling is like a real fight because honestly nothing else can be compared to the intensity of a real fight. At the same time, I find it even more disrespectful when MMA fans act like wrestlers are just a dance team and don’t respect the incredible athleticism wrestling takes as well as the damage those guys tolerate and put their bodies through.

Ok, rant over. Lol."
wow,fdo7rdk,t1_fdo7dp1,1578600364.0,He — Uncle Rico — already competes with two rabbits (Napoleon and pedro) for my attention so a new Vulpera is the last thing he wants!
roomba,fdm8d4t,t1_fdm7w22,1578542326.0,"I tried searching the topic on reddit and didn’t see that thread, thanks a ton since that’s exactly what I was looking for!

Sorry for sounding like an idiot but what’s the big plus of having a HEPA filter? If that’s for the allergies, I can just let it run when I’m at work or outside having a smoke and leave the windows open. My bigger concern would be hay clogging it or it not being able to pick up pellets!"

wiedzmin,fbyvmzk,t1_fbyunuh,1577227555.0,"That’s fine, but you shouldn’t think your subjective idea of Geralt is even in the ballpark of being as legitimate as Sapkowski’s. Just because you have an opinion doesn’t mean it’s a good opinion, since Sap’s opinion on the matter is literally the only one that matters."
