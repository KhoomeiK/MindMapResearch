funny,fghn315,t1_fghmqoh,1580788625.0,You might have now figured this out but it started in sports (or similar competitions) where there was a foul line. To toe the line meant your tow touched but didn't cross the line.
CFL,fghmkl4,t1_fghmicb,1580788265.0,Yes
BobsBurgers,fghm62j,t1_fghgvqb,1580787986.0,"I wasn't a fan of that either. Personal preference but I just thought it was a bit pandering. If you enjoyed it that's great. I like football anyway, they don't need to speak my language to get me to watch."
todayilearned,fghd0dc,t1_fgfwj8m,1580782100.0,What are they doing to your teeth? A cleaning wasn't even 15 minutes for me. But I went regularly because my insurance covered it.
todayilearned,fghctsh,t1_fggbcd5,1580781980.0,"I wasn't even sedated for mine,basically just a non-complicated pulling. I got prescribed 600mg of ibuprofen pills but didn't end up using them. 

It just wasn't too bad for me. I was lucky."
todayilearned,fghcocc,t1_fgg7u0v,1580781884.0,I didn't even have that after my wisdom teeth were taken out but I didn't have any complications.
BobsBurgers,fghawzy,t1_fggm0dr,1580780741.0,"I actually thought it was a bit... pandering I guess is the word. It was insulting how targeted to Latinos it was. 

We get it black Americans and white Americans like football and Latinos are your next market. Singing in Spanish isn't going to make people like a sport."
CFL,fgg5h8w,t1_fgg4p3r,1580754668.0,Wouldn't that likely be better money though?
Boxing,fgeiufd,t1_fgee2p0,1580700535.0,It's become a figure of speech but cro magnon was a name given to a specimen of early Homo sapien.
NoStupidQuestions,fgehwlw,t1_fgefdcc,1580699890.0,"He killed multiple kids, ate them, and then wrote these letters to their parents. He is unbelievably over the top horror movie levels of disturbing."
CFL,fgb6o9a,t3_exjzat,1580659019.0,Any idea roughly what years he played? That would narrow it down a lot.
science,fg3iq7u,t1_fg3iids,1580482501.0,Which at the time was the most effective way to save the highest number of people.
Boxing,fg2h3zy,t1_fg2ggxt,1580444892.0,"I thought he sat the first couple rounds but I might be wrong. 

I have definitely seen people sit the first half and stand the later rounds. Not sure about this fight though."
Boxing,fg2gh7h,t1_fg2g38t,1580444540.0,"It's just people over reacting. 

They are controlled movements not ticks."
Boxing,fg2g8ja,t1_fg2fwzr,1580444413.0,"Muscles will keep working longer if they are used. 

Have you ever noticed that once you sit and relax your muscles feel worse? It has something to do with tissue relaxation and lactic acid seeping deeper into the tissue."
Boxing,fg2f0k5,t3_ewbquk,1580443758.0,Diaz's cut man deserves a medal. That cut is looking better now than it did 3 rounds ago.
Boxing,fg2du3r,t1_fg2dk6b,1580443125.0,"Definitely! Yes he is cross eyed, but the commentator is talking about some irritation or something else out of the ordinary."
Boxing,fg2dogg,t1_fg2djd3,1580443044.0,I think if it gets stopped right now Diaz wins.
Boxing,fg2d6fb,t1_fg2cpe6,1580442781.0,"It would make it harder to watch the eyes to predict his movement. 

It might force people to watch the hands more."

discworld,fg0vowz,t1_ffzyn0q,1580415942.0,Was that in regards to Vimes or Moist? I thought it was Moist but I don't have the best memory.

Paladins,ffxg96t,t1_ffxg44y,1580324533.0,In my experience people from Quebec expect everyone to speak French much more often than people from France.
Paladins,ffxfa9l,t1_ffx6jbz,1580323972.0,You could make them buyable with crystals but include a code with the legos as well.
Paladins,ffxf60s,t1_ffx3f7c,1580323903.0,"I always assume they are from Quebec. It never even crossed my mind that I might be playing against people from France.  


I'm dumb."
Animesuggest,ffx7zfu,t3_evk4zd,1580319651.0,"Others might find them an odd recommendation but I always find sports anime inspiring.   


{Run with the wind} has 2 characters dealing with some pretty heavy feelings  
{Haikyu} is just a hypefest of trying your best will pay off eventually  
{Hajime no Ippo} doesn't particularly deal with any feelings but the main character's hard work and optimism has made me feel better in the past.   


If sports anime isn't your thing all my other suggestions are listed in other comments."
somethingimade,ffx6bhs,t3_ev7cuq,1580318667.0,These are beautiful! You have definitely captured the shape of the petals and stamen much better in this set. The colour is even spot on.
deadpool,ffvrlkd,t3_evbrfv,1580271282.0,Did you ever pet an old dog that has those weird fatty limps under the skin? They aren't actually hurting the animal but they feel gross... I imagine Wade's whole body is just tiny little lumps like that.
gifs,ffvr7lh,t1_ffu6jny,1580270986.0,All I could think of was Blues Clues lol.
pics,ffvclfi,t1_ffvc99y,1580260948.0,I think Americans call them beanies. They can be unisex but most are made for boys or girls.
Paladins,ffupfbp,t1_ffukel0,1580246777.0,Gotta make 'em all!
WTF,fftlzwt,t1_fftktm2,1580223964.0,That might be the original resolution. Watching sports clips from the early 90's I always feel like I need new glasses.
mildlyinteresting,ffs9uqw,t1_ffrvc73,1580176664.0,"The drawbacks are that it is much more labour intensive, time consuming, and expensive. This way takes less equipment and training."
funny,ffs9lab,t3_euulet,1580176484.0,"I appreciate the level of the slap, just hard enough to make a sound but light enough to not actually hurt."
fitbit,ffjn39r,t3_etxdwa,1580002065.0,"Cut out all drinks except water. There are a lot of ""hidden"" calories in drinks. If walking/cardio isn't doing it for you try lifting weights. I don't lose much weight when I get into it but I do lose inches. Stayed the same weight but went down 4 pant sizes since I started lifting again."

Paladins,ffj2mqd,t1_ffivhl9,1579988836.0,I don't know if it was the main reason but I believe that is why some were removed.
Paladins,fffyboj,t1_fffq6ib,1579894468.0,I legit miss this one. I know it was used sarcastically more often than not but I used it sincerely and I miss it.
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffek5wr,t1_ffe6szv,1579851402.0,They have large snow blower attachments and/or use front end loaders to remove the snow.

funny,ff9vjc5,t1_ff9pybh,1579722423.0,I think it is just decorative colouring. The gear shifter has one that runs around the splitter as well.
Paladins,ff989zy,t3_esa0ra,1579707145.0,"> as useful as a paper weight in space 

I love this and I am going to start using it."

mildlyinteresting,ff33pgz,t1_ff2s8i2,1579532888.0,Once you are orientated just delete that stuff and you have a neat USB stick to use. I can't use their website to carry files around.
BobsBurgers,ff0xkyf,t3_eqyo1y,1579473298.0,This reminds me of the Merb'ys from Newfoundland! Check them out online they are hilarious.

gifs,few6i3t,t1_few5dhm,1579405985.0,They are referencing Letterkenny. It is a pretty common phrase though.
WTF,fepbb6n,t1_fepa7rw,1579316355.0,I have been surrounded before. Driving slowly forward they will get out of the way. The car was dented and a nasty crack in the windshield but the only casualty was the bicycle the guy ditched to get out of the way.
WTF,fepb26b,t1_fep1tf6,1579316187.0,He could have honked the horn and drove away if they came towards him. Not even chavs are going to stand in front of a moving car.
pics,femsr24,t1_femsdsy,1579268550.0,"Our swimming lessons were taught by the lifeguards at the pool. It was organized lessons during the morning in the summers. When I did swimming lessons they were colours, treading water with clothes on was introduced in the later lessons (I think green?). They also taught first aid, CPR and basic life guarding techniques.

If you passed all the lessons and we're 16 you could take the bronze cross (I think that's what it was called) to get your lifeguarding qualifications."

It would also take months for me to walk to Brazil but Google maps will estimate it for me."
funny,fed296b,t1_fecxyv7,1578995102.0,Not sure in this context but my university had this for students at night. A pair of students would walk you where you were going and then walk back together so no one was alone at night.
EtsySellers,fe2cf3z,t1_fe23s27,1578836816.0,If you watch to the end of the video she makes them into hair pieces.
WTF,fe096qt,t1_fe07go9,1578806570.0,"I understand what you are saying. I am just disagreeing with you. My stance is if you are properly covered and no other overtly sexual things are going on there is no reason to ban it in public. I don't see why it is any worse than some socially acceptable clothing that is much more revealing. 

I was simply asking where your personal line was out of curiosity."
WTF,fe06rek,t1_fe06h4t,1578804505.0,"It is not like strapping on a Fleshlight, it's like a guy going out in pleather pants with a dancers cup and a vest with no shirt. Everyone knows he is looking for sex but all the bits are well covered. 

What is your opinion on the giant furry suits in public? Those are used for sex play like 90% of the time as well."
WTF,fe05g2y,t1_fe054pa,1578803508.0,"I am saying it isn't hurting anyone. As long as the 2 people are simply sitting and eating, there is no touching or audible discussion of the upcoming plans there is no reason this shouldn't take place in public.

I have done exactly what these people are doing with mundane clothes and no one had any idea it was happening. This choice of clothes makes it more obvious but doesn't hurt anyone."
WTF,fe03lru,t1_fdzy805,1578802217.0,That was sort of my point. As far as we can tell this is just clothing. Odd clothing but very mundane clothing is often used in sex play as well. No reason to ban it in public.
WTF,fdzsx3y,t1_fdznt33,1578795038.0,But lots of people jack off to yoga pants and use them in sex play as well. Should we can those in public too?

NoStupidQuestions,fdl9xfb,t1_fdl9ca6,1578519560.0,Technical they are different animals. The size is because different species grow to different average sizes.
NoStupidQuestions,fdkwiss,t1_fdjovb0,1578512613.0,Unless you are putting them away you can leave the condom on. The dildo isn't ejaculating so you only have to worry about the outside getting dirty.
