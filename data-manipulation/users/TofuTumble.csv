aww,ff9a68d,t1_ff99unv,1579708347.0,"Based on the tag in the dog’s ear, and how happy/healthy the puppy seems, this is probably an area with a high stray dog population taken care of by the locals."
nothingeverhappens,ff63kjp,t3_erv5nc,1579618261.0,"My dad once pulled up behind me in a drivethru, saw me in front of him and (gently) hit my car on purpose to get my attention for a laugh. Dads are dorks."
23andme,fetqw56,t3_eqkuae,1579378558.0,"I had 2 things pop up. One that told me I’m a greater risk of developing celiac disease, which I have. The other was a variant detected for macular degeneration (I think it’s to do with eyes?) but not at an increased risk. 

What I found more interesting was the traits. The test confirmed that I’m just not meant to be a singer."
Celiac,fensdjn,t1_fenqnsf,1579290066.0,That’s so weird. My first IgA test was used to start my celiac diagnosis and my doctors told me it meant I had a wheat allergy. Then they did the ttg test for celiac. This whole thing confuses me. If it’s not actually related to celiac I’m pretty mad that they didn’t investigate a year ago why it was so high.
AskReddit,feksxcz,t3_epnw34,1579206937.0,I woke up in the middle of the night to him pulling the covers up on me and kissing my forehead. He didn’t know I woke up and went to sleep cuddling me. It’s my favorite memory.

AmItheAsshole,fe8exi7,t1_fe89540,1578925427.0,People who claim to have a health issue that don’t have it tend to spread misinformation about that health issue and that causes real problems for people who actually live with it.
Celiac,fdnmzg8,t3_emaur9,1578589164.0,"I don’t know if it’s related to celiac, but I can’t drink more than a half cup of soda before my stomach starts doing flips and I’m nonstop burping."
Celiac,fdnmthk,t1_fdmftog,1578589070.0,This is definitely the worst thing about celiac for me. I always feel like such a nuisance.
aww,fdl307p,t1_fdl2p96,1578516185.0,I think the bars are on a safari truck
aww,fdkxkyi,t1_fdkxcmf,1578513236.0,No links but my dog accidentally got into my roommates unsecured stash and she ended up in the emergency vet with seizures. First thing they asked me was if she was exposed to pot.
migraine,fdgoiyc,t1_fcn9x8g,1578404053.0,Clarify for me.. do you think period pain is over exaggerated? Or not taken seriously enough (like migraines)? Your wording sounds like you think period pain isn’t serious.

dogs,fc5ht1n,t1_fc5gjo5,1577457984.0,"I think those are the people that buy the absolute shit dog food that costs $15 for a big bag, and they’re not thinking of (or maybe don’t take their dog to) the vet."
PublicFreakout,fbgcx0x,t1_fbg9mp2,1576845293.0,And the officer is immune from being sued or prosecuted? That’s gross.
