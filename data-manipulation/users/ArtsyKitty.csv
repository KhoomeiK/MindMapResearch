One week, he surprised me with a gorgeous Tiffany’s necklace with our first initials carved in them and also a vacation. The vacation was amazing and both of us were so happy. 

Fast forward a few days and he broke off our engagement. He didn’t give a reason, I was crying, he was crying. None of it made any sense. There wasn’t another woman. I still don’t know why. 

Anyways, about 2 days later I was so depressed about the whole ordeal that I was driving to the train tracks by my work. I didn’t want to live without him and I knew when each train was an express which meant it wouldn’t stop. I was 100% committed on killing myself. 

On the way there though, I was BAWLING and shaking. I was stopped at a red light where a freight train was passing through. A complete stranger to the right of my lane honked which startled me. He put down his window and was kind of doing these hand movements to roll down mine. I did. He asked if I was okay, I didn’t answer because I just was sobbing uncontrollably.
