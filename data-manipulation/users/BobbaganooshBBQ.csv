We used to sit in my buddies’ cul de sac when we were about 20, have a beer and shoot the shit.  Friend A is facing one direction while friends B and C face the opposite. Friend A sees a multicolored light come flying from horizon to above them at lightning speed. The entire court is lit up so bright it looked like daylight.  Friend A says the bright light went out, multicolored lights blinked and it was gone just as fast, back to the horizon.  So only A saw the coming and going but they were all temporarily blinded by the sudden light change.
