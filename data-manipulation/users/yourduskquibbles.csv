YouShouldKnow,ff26eyf,t1_fehobxi,1579495120.0,"> Just wondering why you don't list Adblock Plus? It took me a while to figure out that the one-click install link would work since it only mentions uBlock Origin.

Adblock Plus, atleast at the time of list creation doesn't provide the compatibility for the [extended uBO filter syntax](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax#extended-syntax) that is used throughout a lot of the list to help with cosmetic site adjustments.

Even without that, some filters in the list would be loaded properly (mainly newletter subscribe filters and social media share filters) but it's possible websites could be buggy and not display properly using Adblock plus without the uBO extended syntax so it is not recommended for that adblocker."

That should do it if you are using the [`raw txt link`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourduskquibbles/webannoyances/master/ultralist.txt). It should also be available as a default filter list that you can enable in Adguard under the 'Annoyances' filter section of adguard."
