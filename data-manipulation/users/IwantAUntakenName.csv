It just like he knows his fan base isn't gonna like this because it's not *him*, it's some watered down bs that doesn't make for good music, at least from a person of his image. Shady had always been this violent f*ck everyone kinda guy but now he's trying to say shady wants to say all this crap that contradicts the image he's made for himself?"
