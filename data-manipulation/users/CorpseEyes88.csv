TumblrInAction,ffeq5l4,t1_ffe3ee0,1579859939.0,"People have this weird idea that different=bad, which is so ironic considering they're also people who want to normalise the different constantly. So they Rob them of words specifically for them and instead suggest they have a word for everyone. It's dumb."
Filmmakers,ffcm5g3,t1_ffcly3f,1579802386.0,"Explanation is probably not alien, is all I'm saying. Also lie detectors aren't very reliable and can be pretty inaccurate."
Filmmakers,ffcjiqv,t1_ffc04oa,1579800800.0,It's nonsense and was likely made up to sell the story. Where's the proof it ever happened
Filmmakers,ffbzm4e,t1_ffbzfqs,1579787694.0,How does that make it scarier? The story it was based on is obviously bullshit
blursedimages,ff3ca6m,t1_ff3a5yd,1579538314.0,"Their support is way bigger because they're a company and I'm just one person, so obviously. But considering how big a company it is the money is basically nothing to them. They likely make much more than that in a day. You think a company giving a days worth of revenue (or less) to a charity sounds exceptional to you?"
blursedimages,ff3bz0v,t1_ff3910s,1579538159.0,"I'm not shitting on something good, I'm glad they gave any money at all. What I'm shitting on is the fact this is something that is very obviously a marketing tactic and nothing more. If it was a campaign that they truly cared about it'd be a much bigger deal. You're just fooling for it and now seeing the company as 'doing good for the community' when considering the amount they gave its blindingly obvious they don't care that much at all unless if it benefits the company."
blursedimages,ff35eqz,t1_ff2s8km,1579534096.0,"That's not my point. The amount of money is so small in comparison to the company that it's laughable. They did it to seem good in the eyes of lgbt people and lgbt allies because that's what makes people like your company now. If they actually cared they'd have donated a lot more. Its nothing to do with the fact that I'd be able to donate more, it's the fact that they donated a tiny sum in the grand scheme of their company just to seem like they care when really it's just a marketing tactic. It's better than nothing of course, but it's being done cynically, so the intent isn't really that good."
blursedimages,ff2n0ra,t1_ff2mtb4,1579514122.0,"Yeah I am, because when you compare how much they earn daily its basically nothing to them. They only did it for marketing and did it as cheap as possible without it sounding too bad to the general person."
blursedimages,ff2lt9v,t1_ff2lohx,1579512250.0,"Idc if its better than other companies, it's still not what you want from something claiming to be for charity. It was less about the charity and more about getting social points for the company"
blursedimages,ff2l7pv,t1_ff2jaj2,1579511357.0,"That's not entirely true, they only donated £10,000 from the revenue to Lgbt charities, which is a joke considering how big of a company M&S are and how small that amount of money are to them. It was all just a sleezy marketing move."

Filmmakers,ff19pmk,t1_ff13pon,1579476606.0,You're a fucking moron. I'm not going to continue arguing with an idiot who Refuses to listen lmao
Filmmakers,ff12o4c,t1_ff0gu2t,1579474639.0,"Using a random quote doesn't change the fact you're wrong. Stop doubling down on your misinformed point, it's just embarrassing now lmao."
Filmmakers,ff041p2,t1_fezyfg8,1579464951.0,"4th wall breaking is a theatre and film convention and it's something done intentionally and requires something meta to happen (talking to audience, referencing the audience etc.) The breaking of immersion is different and is usually not intentional. For example when there was a Starbucks cup in an episode of got. It's not breaking the fourth wall, it's just a mistake that people notice and then causes them to get taken out of the films world. It's two different things so stop saying they're the same."
