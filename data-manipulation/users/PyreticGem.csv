todayilearned,ff08381,t1_fezzhay,1579466198.0,It's pretty appropriate considering that the US intentionally murdered hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians after their political and military leadership had already been defeated and was in the process of negotiating surrender. Not great to die because some selfish American generals wanted a bargaining chip to get a more advantageous deal.

I actually did not guess it, I have no idea what you're talking about.

You seem overly afraid of downvotes, and you're not even arguing that the last season was good, it just seems like you're unwilling to look at 7-8 objectively ""out of respect"" for the previous seasons which is an odd mentality to take when judging a TV show."
freefolk,fezak2r,t1_feyzwa8,1579455375.0,"""Better than anything else out there"" doesn't matter, we're not grading on a curve here.

If everything else is shit, and something slightly less shitty comes out, it doesn't make it non-shit.

Plus you can compare it to itself as it was in the past, and it's obviously a massive, unforgivable drop in quality."
