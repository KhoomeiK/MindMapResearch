I noticed I got a few refreshed stages when I happened to check at midnight but then the next stage would have zero so it make me think that maybe there was a timer or something for the stage refreshing

Thanks for clearing that up!"

aww,fe2mi6r,t1_fe2d2uj,1578840566.0,"Dunno who downvoted you

I like pit bulls but your reasons for not wanting one are valid with your previous experiences and life situation if that's how you feel

And your disagreements with the shelter you have dealt with so far are also valid in my opinion ($600 IS a lot for a stray, and you didn't say $400 was too much for a dog, but complained they wanted $400 for a dog they wouldn't allow you to meet before hand. If they're anything like my local shelters you don't get your money back if your pet doesn't work out at home so that's a real problem if you can't meet them first)"

AskReddit,fcogbxw,t3_ei21zo,1577831550.0,"Sisters husband told me that when he was in the army, before he was with my sister, he was in Russia for a while and that he was in a cafe and once a woman  he was looking at spread her legs at him while sitting at a table and that she had no underwear on so she was showing him her cooch.

I'm a girl and I was like 15 and he was in his 30s at the time so I had no idea why he would have ever told me that. I felt uncomfortable about it at the time so I made the subject change, but later on remembered what he said and realized  just how inappropriate that was to say to his wife's 15 year old sister, not just because of my age and but also because like it's a weird thing to brag about to your wife family members in general.

For those that might ask he never talked to me about that kinda stuff again thankfully. But it still weirds me out to remember it."
funny,fclud26,t1_fckrfje,1577756681.0,"Makes me think of those brands of vaginal soap

&#x200B;

If your hygiene is at least halfway decent you don't new to wash your vagina with soap. It's self cleaning and all that jazz.

&#x200B;

But then they make soap marketed for your privates 

&#x200B;

And people see it and go should I be using soap on my vagina? And thus they start buying a soap specifically to be used on a part of the body where's you don't need to use soap, and where in general using soap on that does more nad than good (yeast infections due to off setting the balance of things down there.

And if memory serves it's expensive to boot."
