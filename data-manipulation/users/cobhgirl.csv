Essentially, a neighbourhood gets notification in regular intervals (twice a year, I think) that on a given day large items will be collected by the council. This could be furniture, white goods, electronics, old paint tubs, lumber, etc.

So the evening before, everyone puts their large items to the kerb, to be collected the next day. As children and students, we loved it. There always was some perfectly good furniture, pots, pans, plates, etc etc that could be had for free.

It got a bit out of hand in the 90s, as people started coming in with vans collecting up everything they thought they could sell on at fleamarkets, and they often ended up distributing the items that had been on (relatively) neat piles all over the streets. I think they've stopped the  practice altogether in some areas. If you have large items to take away, you need to arrange it directly with the council now.

The problem is, the surveys were a global standard, in other words tailored to the US markets. The answers ranged from Very Satisfied to Satisfied to Neutral to Dissatisfied to Very Dissatisfied. I was working for the German market. And if you fix a problem for a German, they will be ""neutral"". It's what they expected to happen, no reason to be satisfied about it. They would have been satisfied if the problem had never occurred in the first place. They would possibly be Very Satisfied if you not only fixed their problem, but ensured that they would never again have any problems, ever, and then sent them a bunch of flowers.

So Neutral, to us, means everything went ok, there were no issues, business as usual.

Neutral to the genius who came up with the system is a negative score.

We got A LOT of Neutral surveys. Usually with a short comment saying something along the lines of ""Everything ok, problem fixed quickly enough, thanks!"".

TBH, I feel it's academical trying to argue what is worse - having your life destroyed by addiction directly, or having it destroyed indirectly and through no fault of your own by being driven into crippling debt, living under constant threat of violence and at the mercy of loansharks through the behaviour of a family member.

Whenever you pass a restaurant of food stand, whenever you have your lunch at work, etc. you will be exposed to the smell of cooked meat.
And I would have to say that personally, I found that to be the case much more so in India than anywhere else I had been previously. Smells of any kind seemed to be magnified. I cannot imagine how one would live there and avoid those smells?

I would also argue that a tin of powdered stock in the kitchen cupboard or 2 unbroken eggs sitting in a fridge are not going to be offensive to anyone, unless one went looking for them.

india,fed5clj,t3_eogkmk,1578999655.0,"I felt very much in two minds when I visited India as a vegetarian (vegetarian for ethical reasons).

In Western countries, you're sometimes lucky if there is one vegetarian option on a restaurant's menu, and that itself will often be ""Please ask your waiter"". This roughly translate as ""Ask us, and we'll go through the back of the fridge and maybe the peels from yesterday, fry up what we find, throw some soy sauce over it and sell it to you as stir-fry for €20"". So having so many choices and such delicious options was a fantastic experience for me.

However, when I chatted with my colleagues while there, I had more than one of them mention to me how some of their family members would use their vegetarianism almost like a weapon. One told me that he and his wife were no longer vegetarian, and consequently her parents had cut contact for years. Even after they had re-established contact, they would not set foot into the non-veg couples house for a long time. They now do come and visit, but the couple have to ""cleanse"" the house before the parents arrive, to make sure that there is no meat in the house at all. Not even powdered chicken stock. And no eggs in the fridge, either.

brexit,fe9di0h,t1_fe84ata,1578936610.0,">Why were people who voted for Brexit so easily to be manipulated by one group of people, but so hard to be manipulated by the remain group?

Because the manipulators for Brexit have a massive head start. Several decades, in fact.

I'm not from the UK and don't live there, but for the past 5 or so years have consumed quite a bit of their news and entertainment (hubby is from the UK, and we live in Ireland, so it's easy to access), and frankly I'm not sure I would be pro-EU if I had been spoon-fed the anti-EU polemic for so long, both from the media and from the politicians. The EU was a really handy whipping boy for the UK political establishment, they could be blamed for absolutely every single wrong in the country, from too many darkies on the streets to the price of fish and chips to the lack of social housing. Politician from both the left and the right have used the EU as an handy excuse for their own shortcomings, and the media were happy enough to invent a few more hair-raising tall tales on top of it.

It apparently was in nobody's interest to speak up and correct neither politicians nor journalists. Add to that that the British public is highly unlikely to access any foreign media, in no small part due to the obstacle of not having a second language, there was nothing there to redress the balance in the public perception.

I really, really hate it when people imply that Leave voters are somehow more stupid than others. I don't think they are, necessarily. We're all human, and if we're being told something for long enough, and we can't easily establish it's untrue, why wouldn't we believe it? As I said, I'm firmly pro-EU, but if I had spent my 40+ years in the UK instead of other EU countries, I would not want to bet that I wouldn't have bought into Brexit, too.

It's not a failing on the side of the population. It's a failing on the side of the media and the political establishment. And it's a failing they will not be held to account for, unfortunately. 

Cameron had just ""won"" the first Scottish independence referendum, and I guess he felt that it would be easy to win the Brexit referendum, too. After all, nevermind the years of badmouthing the EU, to anyone who could see the bigger picture it would be obvious that the UK was better off inside than out. He never realised that most of the population at this point had never seen been shown this bigger picture, and that him changing his tune from ""The EU is to blame for lack of housing, lack of healthcare, lack of jobs and lack of fish!"" to ""Our economy would not be as strong as it is today without the EU, we would have serious difficulties if we decided to leave"" would be seen by most as disingenuous and two-faced."

vegetarian,fdkbph2,t3_elqrz4,1578500492.0,"Only you can decide this.

My advise would be : Don't beat yourself up about it. You'e gone 6 month as a vegetarian. If the cravings are too much now, maybe allow yourself the thing you crave the most (burger pizza?), then see how you feel after that. I think it might be worth a try to see if giving in now will allow you to go without meat for longer afterwards, maybe 9 month or a year? And then see if you can increase the time even further next time. 

Or maybe go back to being flexitarian.

It may also be a good idea to have a medical check-up. While a vegetarian diet would give a healthy adult all they need in nutrition, it is possible that you may be low on some vitamins or iron. This could easily cause cravings as you describe them.

That's just a suggestion, though, and it's completely up to you. But please do not feel like a failure if you do decide to stop being vegetarian for now. This isn't a competition, and it's not something you have to see through to win. It's a personal decision, based on personal reasons for each and every one, and it's a decision we make anew every single day. It's not all-or-nothing - if I decided to eat meat today, that would be my choice. And if then tomorrow I decided not to eat meat any more, I would be vegetarian again."

But forgiveness does change the future, the future of the survivors.They have a choice of letting their negative emotions, their anger and pain rule the rest of their lives, or to forgive and move on.

That does not mean that forgiveness is easy, far from it! It still would have taken them an unimaginable amount of reflection, care, love and hope to work through the grief and suffering. And the fact that so many of them managed to do that, and managed to see beyond their own shattered hopes and dreams to notice that the perpetrator's family was in the same place as they were, but were being vilified on top, and to actually find the strength to go out and help them...
