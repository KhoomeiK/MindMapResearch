If i have time, i like to bake my potatoes for about 45 mins to an hour at 350 or 375f. Wait for them to cool off and then dice whatever I plan on eating and saving the rest for later use. That is my prefered method. 

Next method is the boil. Ill fill a pot with cold water, add scrubbed whole potatoes and bring them to a boil without a lid and then gently simmer them until theyre soft to the touch but not exploded and split in the water. Wait to cool. Dice and fry.

You dont always have to wait to cool but it is easier to handle if they are.

I love potatoes so i always have cooked whole taters on hand. Once a week I'll par cook about 3 pounds and just take a few when i decide I want some for that evening."
AskCulinary,ffn7d55,t3_eu9v7i,1580062763.0,"Yeah it sounds like you moved them around too much. If youre not deep frying, you need to keep everything in the pan still so you can make that nice crust. Id also go away from frying in olive oil as that has a low smoke point and will leave an off putting taste.

Also using a parcooked tuber will shorten your cook time and give you more of a crust. 

Good luck!"
