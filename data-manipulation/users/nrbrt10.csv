Taxation =! Theft you're assuming your conclusion and running with it. The reason healthcare in the US is so expensive is because there are a lot of middlemen to pay for a service the government can do better and cheaper, most bills aim to remove these middlemen which would make healthcare more affordable.

According to BI they made more than 11 billion dollars on 2013, but most of it wasn't through hard work at the office, but capital gains i.e. investments. You can argue that they've worked to where they are now, and you'd be right, but their *current* wealth isn't generated by hard work.
