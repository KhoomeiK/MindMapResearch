hoarding,fdwmim5,t1_fdwkjfa,1578760243.0,Thank you. It truly is nice to hear from other people that the struggle is real. Lol!
hoarding,fdsk857,t1_fds5ybf,1578704215.0,"My mother turns 60 this year. Yikes. My brother and I always talk about just moving her out of the current mess (and then burning it to the ground), though we know that it will never change her hoarding tendancies.

She told me today that she wants to be back in her own space next week. To which I replied that we need to move some things out before that can happen. She agreed, but I know it will be a fight through the whole thing."
hoarding,fdsjo4i,t1_fdprbwa,1578703995.0,"The pets are all sequestered in their own areas, though I have to move through the hoard to get to them. Some on the front porch, some in a bathroom, some in the garage, etc..., so they are not free in the mess, which helps in maintaining their needs.

Moving them only proves an issue because there are so many. She is an animal hoarder as well. My mother breeds specialty cats. They are varieties of Siamese, Himalayan, and Polydactyl cats. She does sell them, so she uses that as a reason to continue having so many, and she cares for all of them, but there are 17 cats currently.

It is all just so much."
hoarding,fdsisfa,t1_fdqit8a,1578703551.0,"Thank you for your response and advice! I am glad to hear that my (literal) gut reaction to the mess is not to be dismissed. I will look into contacting someone that can be helpful as soon as I can.

I guess the motivation behind my questions is that I want to address the mess with her there. I don't want to make it worse by taking it into my own hands while she is decrepit. Especially as she is in a safe location currently.

I do, however, have a scary tendency to put myself in the lowest priority slot, and it has proven detrimental to my health in the past. And the animals fall into my care for the time being, which means that I need to do what is right for them."

AskReddit,f789a6e,t3_dutswh,1573488388.0,"At roller derby practice. I was up on my toe stops, chest to chest with a team mate, and pushing while they were bracing against me. I rolled my right foot over the toe stop, and all of my weight landed on the front of my right ankle, bending my foot backwards. Strained the joint and all it's connective tissue."
