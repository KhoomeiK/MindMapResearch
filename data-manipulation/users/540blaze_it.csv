I'm only going less than 30mph but im still coming to these cars and the intersection. Pull on the e-brake, nothing. The rear wheels are already moving and spinning too fast for that to work. I ended up swerving around the cars at the stop sign, going into the other lane and swerving hard right, to not hit the oncoming traffic and to slow me down. very scary"

cars,fcgpt3h,t1_fcbb0y6,1577642826.0,"I enjoyed the car, it was so pretty. I liked looking at it in my garage more than driving it. 

TL;DR of why I sold: The manual trans is very clunky around town, and i live just a 15 min drive between work and home. It shines at highway speeds but 1st/2nd gear puttin thru town is pretty awful. 

Other main reason - just worried about the rod bearings, didn't want to worry every time i turned on the car ""will this be the day it blows"". I could have had em replaced, but that seemed crazy to spend 3000 bucks fixing an issue no other engines have. and people have replaced RB's just to have an engine failure later anyway. I mentally took that 3 grand and put it in the next car fund. 

The other main reason: it wasn't that fast and felt pretty bloated. My other car is a supercharged e36 m3, which is 350hp vs my 450hp e92, but much more nimble and feels better in my hands for some reason. The 450hp of the e92 was all up top at 8400rpm. Between waiting for the 10-60 oil to warm up and my short commute, i never could ring it out and use the power. I think some mid range turbo power will do me nicely"
