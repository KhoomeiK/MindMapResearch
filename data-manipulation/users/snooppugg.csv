I’d totally drive to another state to meet a rescue but that’s me and obviously we are in much different situations. I just know my life would be very different if I’d gone with a puppy from a breeder versus the incredible senior goof of a dog I have now who honestly keeps me going.

I think breeders should be far more regulated and limits should be put on the number of them. I didn’t once say they’re all bad or lump them in with puppy mills. Part of the problem is the ignorance of those who don’t consider other options like you obviously have.

To each there own. I hope you find the most perfect puppy."

And what rescue isn’t allowing you to meet a dog? With most of not all you have to meet them.

Yes, some shelters act that way as many are underfunded with overworked employees dealing with terrible supervisors. That’s how my local shelter is.

Yes, I know dogs aren’t an accessory? But some of the most incredible companions I’ve had in my life were the goofiest dogs. My dog and my cats are my children."

WorkOnline,fdogorj,t1_fdof3kq,1578604782.0,"I'll be completely honest and straight up, they've changed their pay scheme and structure up multiple times since September 2018 when I started with them and it's kind of confusing. Sorry this is so long.

Here's the current breakdown as best as I can explain:

You start with a base right: advertised at $13-$23/hr (I'm at roughly $16 an hour currently). You only receive this for time you are actually teaching even if you're schedule for other hours that don't get filled with classes (previously they offered half pay for any standby time).

They also have a stability factor that they throw in that's based on the number of classes you have with the same student. Honestly the highest rate only goes to like $1.03 and I can't even figure out where they're adding this to my pay.

Then there's the step bonus ranging from an extra $1/hr up to $7/hr based on how many hours you work in a month.

There are also cancellation subsidies like if a student cancels last minute (30-50% basepay) and a bonus of $7 for every trial class converted to a paying student.

This probably comes off as kind of confusing and honestly, many of us have been confused off and on. For example with me though, I'm scheduled 28 hours (7 a week) with them a month and on average I'd say I make between $350-$400 a month. Some months it's more if I add on extra time, some months it's less like when students cancel for school holidays or if I take time off."
