politics,fdlachb,t1_fdl9qn9,1578519804.0,"That's why I repeatedly pointed out the author of that article is an establishment Dem.  The author's POV is explicitly NOT the point of view of most Sanders supporters, but the fact that it's written from the point of view of a centrist makes it more compelling for those who try to argue Bernie isn't practical or realistic, because the author is arguing that he is practical and realistic, despite appearances.

Bernie supporters read that article and think, ""yes, he does have a good voting record, yes, he has shown the ability to get practical results, and no, you're wrong for disagreeing with his rhetoric because the Democratic party and US electoral politics as a whole truly does need to be massively restructured (aka 'revolutionized,') but yes, thanks for formulating an argument that will be useful for convincing others who see things the way you do.""

edit: And just as an aside to address what appears to be the general tone of your comments: of course a political ""revolution"" is unlikely.  Any serious attempt to go against the tide of the massively powerful, massively wealthy forces that seek to maintain the status quo is likely to fail, but if one believes that things are not currently as they should be, why wouldn't you come up with a plan for what improvement looks like, and once you have a plan, why wouldn't you seek to popularize that plan with straightforward, simple messaging.  I think it's important not to cling so tightly to the cynicism that allows us to feel we see through the ""bullshit"" that we miss an opportunity to participate in an effort that could galvanize broad swaths of people in an earnest attempt to make positive change."
politics,fdl47ie,t1_fdl33aj,1578516764.0,"There's nothing baffling about an establishment Dem writing an article directed at other establishment Dems about why Sanders' actions are practical and have produced concrete results despite his message being focused on ""political revolution.""  If you actually read the article you shouldn't be confused.  The author explains that he and many establishment Dems don't like how Bernie disparages a political approach as cowardly that they simply see as pragmatic, they don't like the idea of a ""revolution"" because they believe in the centrist incrementalism characteristic of the Democratic party, this despite the fact that Bernie has explained his vision of revolution simply involves a far more active electorate than the left has seen in the past several decades, medicare for all, higher taxes on the wealthy, free public education, etc.  The article very clearly explains that despite the fact that he and many establishment Dems dislike messaging that they see as overblown or unnecessarily contentious, Bernie's voting record reflects realistic, consistent progress within the means available to him."
politics,fdl1fqg,t1_fdl0e0p,1578515383.0,"When people talk about ""navigating bureaucracy"" in this context, they mean advancing an actual cause and getting concrete results within a bureaucratic system, not advancing one's own self-interest while paying lip-service to liberal concerns, which is what Biden does."
politics,fdl18i9,t1_fdl0g5v,1578515279.0,"This article is aimed specifically at establishment Dems who don't believe in the idea of ""a political revolution.""   It isn't written for those who already believe in the message Bernie is running on."
politics,fdl0wsc,t1_fdkzorj,1578515104.0,"No, ""everyone else"" in this thread does not get it, and it isn't ""squabbling"" to acknowledge there is a difference between the candidates.  I believe those who do their research and are seriously interested in advancing the causes espoused by both Sanders and Warren would be prudent to move over to the Sanders side.  I don't hate Warren and I don't disparage those who currently feel they would vote for her, but the fact is the two camps cannibalize each others voters so it is important to get as many people as possible who are actually on the left voting for a single candidate so that candidate can beat Biden.  Biden voters aren't as vocal on reddit, but hopefully when they are Bernie supporters respond enthusiastically just as I am doing here."

AskReddit,fdhsfrc,t1_fdh7okq,1578429290.0,"The entire upvote-downvote system encourages a style of discussion that is either A: obsessively pedantic and pseudo-rational (because people don't want to get called out and downvoted for some minor quibble that they will inevitably get gotcha'd on) or B: ""creative"" and ""funny"" in ways that fall in line with a house style that has previously been shown to be successful.  Most comments that don't aim for bland general popularity don't get seen.  Sticking to smaller subreddits helps though."
