unpopularopinion,ff7dug8,t3_erx2x0,1579647264.0,"agreed. frankly I see *no* issue in placing all religions and ideologies under equal amounts of scrutiny. 

no ideology is to be protected from scrutiny or humour or... anything. as humans, we criticize. and to limit said criticism is to limit progress."
AMA,feo59mc,t3_epycy7,1579295332.0,"Hey. Im sorry. 

Pls don't spend the 2 weeks stressing. There's a lot of people who'll tell you to get a lot of things done in your last two weeks, and, while that is true, you should prioritize yourself here. Im sure the most you could ask of your last two weeks on Earth is to simply be happy more or less. So do that, be happy. See family. Tell them you love them. 

This is an insanely sad time. I'm sure. but if you can maybe come to terms with the scenario and live out your weeks happy-ish, you'll be happier. 

disclaimer: I'm not in your scenario and I've got no clue hard hard this is. so maybe take my advice with a grain of salt. I have, though, been on the other side when my father was given a short prognosis and passed. and I can tell you this : if you can find a way to be happy now, your family will follow. also, this is the latest memory they'll have of you; you being happy in the toughest time. a solid legacy to leave. 

good luck."

unpopularopinion,fefrv1d,t1_fef90kw,1579063358.0,"good question. maybe broaden their horizons in regard to opposing views? maybe they're under the impression that everyone should be accepting of all races in all regards, but this is untrue. so, besides ""lowering their opinion of me"", I expect to allow them to become a more aware member of society and thus more productive. 


you see, not all statements and pov's revolve around the person's feelings and opinions. informing someone that you aren't feeling the connection because you find their darker pigment less attractive is 100% acceptable and even honorable as it's a level of honestly many lack. furthermore, any alternative rationale you may give would obstruct the truth in a false effort to preserve *feelings*. 

racism is predetermining someone's worth based on race. racism is an issue because worth is determined independent of appearance. attraction on the other hand, *does* concern appearance, thus making skin colour a very valid factor."

trying to protect your kid from ""the real world"" is only putting off the inevitable and does a lot more harm than good. parents should teach the kid how to deal with these real world things and to have a conscience when comming across them. I would not stop my kid from using the internet or regulating what they do. I'd teach them right and wrong and what they *shouldn't* do but I'll trust that when they come across that nipple they'll understand it's inappropriate but it's life and will just keep scrolling."

ie. circumcision is bad because your doing it to a kid who can't decide for themselves. this argument rests on the morality of surgically altering your kids genitalia, not on how important it is that you happened to remove some extra skin from his dick. 

so when you respond that circumcision is not a big deal, you are not even remotely addressing the points made regarding principal.

you brushed off that response but they make a good point. 

1- Most aren't scared of death, we're scared of how we'll die. 

2- Untill you have to face it, your opinion on it is only a guess on how you'd react. till it happens you've got no clue. 

So, yeah, death is natural and inevitable and thus shouldn't be feared. I agree. but the way you go out? not inevitably bad and not always natural.
