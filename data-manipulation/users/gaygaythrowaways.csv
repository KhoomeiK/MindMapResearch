No one is impressed by this."
dogs,ffoggtn,t3_euchyq,1580077362.0,"I'm a big supporter of behavioral euthanasia when it's necessary. I think you really need to try a positive reinforcement trainer to work on counter conditioning with this dog before considering euthanizing. The training he's been subjected to has likely made his fear of people much, much worse. But you don't know how well he may take to counter conditioning and desensitization is you don't try!

I'd look for a certified vet behaviorist to get a realistic prognosis. They will typically be able to refer out to a positive reinforcement trainer that they trust!"
dogs,ffodvy4,t1_ffo3zgr,1580076669.0,"Oooooh that's such a good idea!! My dog very recently learned to bow but the cue is very awkward, it's even hard for her to understand when I'm doing it. That's a much better idea, no clue why I didn't even consider it lol. 

For some reason every child we've come across is super impressed by her jumping up to touch their hand with her nose. She loves touch and jumping, she's basically spring loaded lol. It works well because it's very simple and difficult her to not interpret a hand held with the palm facing down correctly! She'll get frustrated and bark when she can't figure out what someone else is trying to cue her to do so I gotta keep it simple enough."

dogs,ffnus5z,t1_ffnj2b1,1580071117.0,Typically lip licking is either some level of anxiety or anticipation. My dog lip licks when loud trolleys pass by (anxiety) and when I shake a bag of treats (anticipation).

dogs,ffhi9xa,t1_ffgeeqs,1579936471.0,"Agreed. Reactive dogs exist, and it's a behavioral problem in itself. But a dog who barks on leash because it's frustrated it can't greet another dog is NOT the same as a dog who would kill another dog if given the chance.

I regularly see the term 'reactive' used to describe aggressive dogs. ""Oh that tiny dog shouldn't have been off leash, my dog is reactive and that's why he grabbed onto its neck and shook it!"" That's aggression y'all. But you almost NEVER see anyone flatly describing their dog as human or dog aggressive. It's just ""severe reactivity""."

Admittedly even pit puppies! They're cute and it's not their fault they're going to grow up to be too dangerous to be pets in our society.

But that... it looks ill. Like it looks like somethings wrong and it's not cute at all."
BanPitBulls,ffdnp5l,t1_ffdi0w9,1579824760.0,"Unfortunately many dogs ARE afraid of toddlers running because it is very erratic and unpredictable compared to adult human behavior. This is typically due to the dog not being socialized with small kids during the critical period when they are very young puppies. I love little kids and obviously a one year old isn't intimidating to ME, but I can see why it would confuse and concern a dog that isn't used to it! 

However - biting the kid in the face is NOT a normal or appropriate response from a dog. A nervous dog should flee the situation, maybe hide behind the owner or bark if they're cornered. But often the ""fear"" of children these pits are displaying is more akin to predatory behavior and the pit folks compare them to the normal dogs who might be skittish around kids. I have a herding breed rescue who would bark at (and back away from) a strange toddler if they ""charged"" her, but she sure as hell wouldn't lunge or snap or BITE the poor thing! I've been working on it and I don't let toddlers near her because I'm not an idiot. How a one year old was ""accidentally"" given access to this aggressive pit is beyond me."
dogs,ffafcsv,t1_ffaepui,1579734424.0,"My dog was very well cared for, there's no need to make assumptions about my dog suffering.

I agree with you in that I believe I only post on relevant topics, I certainly don't make a point to post about aggression on posts that aren't already about aggression.

It's just really frustrating to constantly be told ""Goodbye I won't talk to you, you're prejudiced!"" for giving honest opinions and thoughts based on my experiences.

However, the dog has already shown it will seek out a familiar dog and spontaneously attack it. This is not normal dog behavior. Dogs give each other cues that are escalating - they go from subtle to more obvious (barking, growling, raised hackles, air snaps). Not from subtle to attacking. A dog as large as a mastiff that acts this way is unsafe in the hands of most people."

These dogs were bred to guard property from strangers and your dog acted accordingly when he was approached by a strange person. Due to their size and strength they can really, really do damage to someone or even kill them.

If you do not have the appropriate home for a tibetan mastiff and you are unable to put in the work to manage the dog properly, I would opt to euthanize for the public's safety."
BanPitBulls,ff74no3,t3_es0yn2,1579641045.0,"I don't believe we should take anyone's personal pet dog and euthanize them if they have shown no signs of aggression. The owners should still treat them as a danger toward other pets and any vulnerable people, but that can be managed by leashes, muzzles, and proper containment in a responsible home (which is unfortunately rare).

However - there is no need to keep adopting potentially dangerous dogs out into the public. Euthanasia of bully breeds in shelters would do a lot toward slowly eradicating the type of dog that is most likely to disfigure, maim, and kill both humans and other animals alike. Humane euthanasia is peaceful and painless for the animal. Wallowing in ""no-kill"" shelters for years on end is animal abuse, imo. There's no way to tell which pitbulls will turn on, and warnings are often minimal. So proactive action would be necessary to actually put a dent in this very real issue."
Dogtraining,ff68wkv,t1_ff5zb5x,1579621892.0,"Not only that - but correcting the growling also tells the dog ""You can't growl to warn me when you're uncomfortable!""

dogs,ff45g45,t1_ff44pti,1579555951.0,"I think in all honesty, if you are going to regularly bring your dog to a dog park with mostly unknown dogs, it's very likely she'll get into some sort of fight at some point in her life. Most dog ""fights"" are just noisy arguments that don't involve any actual teeth on skin, so they sound a lot scarier than they look! 

There are dogs that will stand down in absolutely all situations, but that's relatively uncommon for adult dogs. And even then there is no guarantee another dog won't get aggressive and snap at or bite your dog anyways, regardless of whether or not she participates.

dogs,ff42wqy,t3_erjde5,1579554370.0,"I went through this exact same situation, panic and anxiety about my dog being a ""bad dog"" and all!

Unfortunately, there are pushy dogs at dog parks and their owners often have little control or understanding of dog body language. My dog can be rough and she nips heels during play, but she has excellent recall off other dogs and I'm very attentive to ensure the other dog is also having fun! 

She had some bad experiences at the local smaller dog park (small urban space, lots of dogs) and was becoming increasingly defensive. Where she would previously run away or tuck her tail, she'd started baring her teeth and air snapping when large dogs would get overly physical with her. This isn't abnormal dog communication at all and isn't a bad thing. However, it is a sign that your dog may too frequently be in uncomfortable situations if this is a new behavior. I started becoming more proactive and we avoid small dog parks until about 8 pm now where there are virtually no dogs. She much prefers to go to a large wooded park where she can tree squirrels in the fenced area and ignore other dogs lol. 

I really don't think this is a sign that your dog isn't a dog park candidate or she'll never enjoy the dog park again. I'd make sure to leave if this particular dog is there and to keep a closer eye on her body language so you can call her off when she begins to get uncomfortable. Teeth baring is well within socially acceptable dog body language and is not an indicator that your dog is going to flip any switches, just that she's going to react like a typical adult dog if pushed too far by a dog ignoring her other signals!"

We've just worked on a solid recall off other dogs and it works perfectly. Her recall isn't 100% off everything (squirrels are her kryptonite) but learning to recall off play with dogs has gone very well with consistency. You need to start smaller - work on recall off dogs before the play gets intense or rough. Call her off just after sniffing a dog or playing for a few seconds. Reward heavily! And then work up to recall off more intense play. There's no need to punish the behavior - you need to be able to catch it and recall when the other dog is uncomfortable. 

Learning from other dogs didn't really work for her because she'll interpret being charged after heel nipping as her successfully continuing the chase game. So it was all on me!"

There is no actual evidence that people are misreporting dog attacks as ""pit bull attacks"" when it was truly a fluffy golden retriever."

Yeah I owned a child and dog aggressive (with little to no warning) pit bull rescue for four years. A living nightmare and no one believed me when I insisted she was a ticking time bomb. I never let her near dogs or kids again so she never actually got the chance to bite. But she straight up muzzle punched a child out of nowhere for just existing which was a horrible experience."
dogs,febmfwk,t1_feblywg,1578960389.0,"Lol. Dogs don't exist in a vacuum. Many herding dogs will attempt to herd other animals or people. Retrievers will retrieve a ball despite it not being water fowl. 

I have owned a truly dog aggressive pit bull before and therefore I would not be choosing to purchase an APBT from a breeder or any other source. My preference is for a dog breed that is not prone for dog or human aggression. Nothing wrong with those traits if you can manage them, but I'm not interested in experiencing that again."
dogs,febk0s1,t1_febjikl,1578959644.0,Child aggression is not inherent to GSDs and Mals. Dog aggression is inherent to many APBTs and other breeds as well. You can minimize and manage but dogs have been trained for generations for specific breed traits and I understand you'll continue to cover your ears and deny it until you experience true genetic dog aggression rearing it's head. Best of luck with that!
