AskReddit,ffq4vxk,t1_ffq2ybj,1580120632.0,"I also used to think biting your nails was quite unusual, but I've come to realise it's actually extremely common, for most it's not a habit though.

And we're not talking about passing a disease, since it's not a disease a dog has, but rather a bacteria that has landed anywhere on a dog (around the outside and in their mouth) and you then picked it up when kissing him.

From your research, you're telling me if a dog chews shit and spews it out, it is safe to eat? Since your claim is that once bacteria goes into a dogs mouth it gets neutralised, or otherwise there'd always be a chance that some remnants of feces protect bacteria inside it and you are able to catch it during kissing."
AskReddit,ffq2q1w,t1_ffq0zet,1580117147.0,"""have never been passed from human feces to dog mouth to human mouth""?


That's a really strong claim there mate and knowing the number of bacteria that exist in our feces and how the resistance of bacteria comes from single units surviving what has killed all of the other bacteria I think it's a false claim.


But outside of that there is no rational gross. If someone reeks of shit, but it's just a shit smell cologne, it doesn't mean he's sick, or he's a disease carrier but it does mean we're disgusted by him.

But hey you keep doing your dog kissing/licking/macking or whatever you enjoy. It's similar to biting your nails after using public transport: unlikely to give you a disease but when it does, it really won't feel worth it."
AskReddit,ffq01eh,t1_ffpy44t,1580113092.0,"A) bacteria can survive quite a long time in a fertile land like a mouth. 


B) I don't think anyone is talking about passing bacteria, this is a thread about what makes you flaccid/dry and this shit turns me into a sponge instantly, no matter how you try to defend your proxy-shit-eating habits"
