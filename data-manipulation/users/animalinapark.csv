I agree that the guy got what was coming, but people should really be more aware what a single fall can do to you. Dying is not the worst thing. 

You can become a shell of your former self, not really knowing why things dont work out anymore. You slowly waste away, suffering for the rest of your life, battling against your crippled mind. That, in my opinion, is worse than death."
todayilearned,ffnoxe4,t1_ffnnvjg,1580068743.0,"Sony WH1000XM3, but Bose QC35 II or even Bose 700 could be a bit better. Comes down to how you prefer your music to be flavored by them. Sony should have more noise reduction."
todayilearned,ffn9awm,t1_ffmlix4,1580063357.0,"They aren't especially effective at cancelling human voices. They are good at reducing background noise and such but talking not so much. And I have supposedly the best ANC headphones. Only having the noise cancelling on and nothing else also brings this odd pressurised sensation that I don't like.

You have to listen to some ambient sound or music to really not hear anything else, and it's pretty good if you find something that suits your concentration."

Futurology,fekjgcd,t1_fekjeil,1579201317.0,Kay well I'm done with this.

They aren't special just because you think so. They use basically the same components as any other smartphone. They have their own cpu which is good, but it's nothing mindblowing. Their screens are good but there are better."
Futurology,fek9ct8,t1_fek6b86,1579195318.0,"No, basically as zack said nothing to do with the inherent ""betterness"" of the phone, just perceived value.

No idea where you pulled the rest from."
ABoringDystopia,fek6i6x,t1_fejmlii,1579193630.0,"Technically, but it isn't producing anything other than numbers in systems.

Give the poorest percentage the same amount divided equally and all that money flows through the entire economy, buying houses, clothes, food, all kinds of products that support thousands of different individual companies, which in turn pay their employees who keep the ball rolling.

A single person just simply can't stimulate the economy at all."
Futurology,fek5718,t1_fek4fzo,1579192849.0,"That's a huge amount of claims without any evidence.

It seems to me the price of the product is the most significant factor. Because a new iphone costs a lot, people who want an Apple product no matter what but can't afford the newer ones go for a lot older phones to save some money. I've seen 4 year old refurbished iphones cost more than the newest android model with superior specs in every way."
