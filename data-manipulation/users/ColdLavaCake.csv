socialskills,fepdmht,t3_eq4cqc,1579317914.0,"I also used to do the same in primary school and it worked with most of the kids but in highschool it was of no use and I would always end up being a laughing stock for a number of people, I was a quiet kid, always observing, only speak when it was needed.
So when the water was above the head I started to follow #TIT# #FOR# #TAT# rule for sometime giving it back without having a second thought and thing got better after some time I wasn't the laughing stock anymore and cut to 3 months past this incident me and my best friend were discussing about this and he told me,
""what you did was absolutely correct whenever you were being laughed at there were many people who wants to help you but unless you speak up for yourself nobody's going to do that for you"" 
That hit me hard and I was like it's true,  you need to establish you grounds, you need to give importance to yourself, you need to establish your boundaries as well as respect boundaries of others. 
And karma takes care of the rest bro."
