science,feg0sof,t3_eosjxc,1579072073.0,"So mainly the difference between THC inhibiting growth or increasing growth depends on the cannabinoid receptors' health. Which would make sense as to why HPV+ patients would be negatively affected by THC concerning tumors. So maybe we need more research on the essentiality of our cannibinoid receptors, because it has been proven that pure concencrated THC has slowed tumor growth while protecting healthy cells. 

If they really truly wanna cure cancer, this study seems like a pretty viable link. And if the people who make chemo meds wanna keep making money, they better start lobbying for legalization so they can figure it out first and capitalize instead of fighting the change."

WWE,fds2jul,t1_fdrmrxr,1578693353.0,"The plain fact of the matter, in Nikki and John's case, is that she fell out of love with him. He was never around. They saw each other once a month at the most. She thought she could be okay with that. But the idea that she would never be a mom after watching her sister be a great mom got in her head. And then even if she did convince him to let her do it, what kind of dad would that be for her kid? She knew it, even he knew it. He said it relentlessly that he couldn't be the dad he'd wanna be cuz he was a workaholic. 

They had a typical end of the road too, where every time they are together all they did was fight. He was reasonable. She didn't want him to be reasonable, she wanted him to be emotional. And then she started dancing with that dude and realized she didn't click with John, even after 8 years, as well as she clicked with this random guy. And decided that was the tipping point. She tried to stick it out with John for the fans, but didn't wanna betray her heart for popularity any more. And she didn't wanna get divorced again. So. Yeah. It wasn't about winning for her, it was about not losing.

That said, I'm pretty sure she cheated on John with Artem.

John, who had lived with the inner turmoil of trying to be everything he could to give this woman what he thought she deserved, decided changing himself even as a mega millionare was entirely worth it. So he did. He was ready to quit working and settle down. Be there, as a dad and husband. So when he realized she was already too far gone by te time he had conceded, and then lost her. It fucked him up so bad he quit working and disappeared in China. He doesn't even wanna be on TV anymore and only does it for the right paychecks. I feel for him.

The fan girl in me was praying the break up was a work, she'd ""be with Artem"", ""cheat"" on Artem with cena, and then the two of them would elope. Boom a whole season of Total Bellas. And then in the next one she could be pregnant."

A long, LONG time ago, it seemed to make sense to people, to make the states equal, that some votes had a bigger stock than others, so one state couldn't decide the fate of the entire country. But we fully recognize now that that is not necessary anymore. A lot of states are making the decision to make our ""electoral college"" null and void by siding the state votes with the popular vote. I don't think any of us can apologize enough, which sucks for those of us who did NOT vote for him.

science,fcjsahp,t3_ehb2fq,1577702141.0,"The power the mind has over our bodies is irrefutable, and I would venture to guess the things we think affect our evolution, too. So of course the mere stress of meeting the criteria of manhood would affect men physically. 

As a woman with two boys, I can see how difficult it is to be a man in today's society. The women have sort of taken the helm in trying to become equal, and women are capable of whatever they want to do. But no one is really talking about the problems men have in developing emotionally, or really, beyond anything physical. 

I grew up in the end of ""don't be a sissy"" or ""you hit like a girl"" or ""what are you some kind of fairy"" and the effect is an unattainable ideology for perfect manliness. All men have to be Ron Swanson. Denying that men have emotions or feelings can be catastrophic, even deadly. We chalk up manliness to be this sort of mostly physical thing. Build stuff, be good at this physical activity. Work hard. Which, men are physically stronger than women and to deny that would be pure ignorance.

But while men are more physical creatures than women, I am of the theory that men's emotions are more intense and powerful than women's. And while women are naturally more inclined to empathy due to maternity, I would venture to guess men probably feel more deeply, and it needs to be further studied and understood.

You can be a man, and be into sports and construction and all the typical stuff. And you can also accept that sometimes things hurt and it's okay to feel sad or lost or confused or afraid. You don't have to turn it into anger or rage. You can be a man and be into gardening and glitter and ponies. And it doesn't make you any less of a man than the egg-and-bacon-eating Ron Swansons of the world. Redefine what being a man means. And it starts with dads. The most severely undervalued job in the world. Dads change the world by empowering their sons, showing them how to navigate their emotions, and how to handle themselves physically too."
