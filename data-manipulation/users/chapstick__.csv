technology,ffmhs8e,t1_ffmh6gs,1580054826.0,I do. I use really bulky cases because I find the small phones really uncomfortable to hold. But the phone still crack and when they do they crack front and back.
technology,ffi4uhf,t1_ffhxsno,1579965117.0,I hat this argument so much. Phone in my opinion are getting way to thin to be comfortable. I would much rather the phone thick enough to hold and fit a analog jack with usb-c. All the other extra space could go to a battery. Right now I'm stuck with getting really bulky cases or else the phone will practically slip out of my hand. Also can we go back to aluminum bodys I'm tired of my entire phone cracking.
cycling,ffgk0qr,t1_fffybh1,1579908008.0,Not to argue with you but I think another point to make is would you drive less. This guy must drive everywhere if he doesn't commute on bike at all.
cycling,fffsm9q,t1_fffs6cs,1579890910.0,Your solution is completely bs. Just because you dont commute does not mean you are suddenly in the right. This is like saying of you dont want to get hit just use bike indoors. Bikes are a utility first and foremost and a luxury 2nd. So dont act like leaving your bike locked up anywhere is the problem because it completely ignore commuter.

bicycling,fezyf3z,t1_fezx08c,1579463248.0,I would say peloton does not seem to be a brand that will last long enough to warrant a investmant. I think in about 2 or 3 years the bikes are just going to be landfill or fancy looking spin bike with a built in tablet. Atleast the other set is compatible with multiple programs and leaves you with atleast a bike that can be used outside of just the work out regime. You could even get an e-bike with good rain gear and shoes could use it to get around.

news,fdhl425,t1_fdhkfco,1578424947.0,More cars = equal more traffic. You are not the only driver and there are more every day. Your traffic I's going to continuously get worse unless there are viable alternatives. Trains are not feasible in the near future. City wills say it takes 5 years and then it will take 10 more with delays. Not to mention that they will still take up road space because trains are not some magical entity existing outside of space and time and will still follow roads that are put right up against property and other Important infrastructure.

BaseBuildingGames,fddqxed,t1_fdct6dm,1578321626.0,What I'm really kind of holding out for befor getting completely immersed  is more mechanical things.

todayilearned,fdanmch,t1_fdack3n,1578248067.0,But the problem is any added suger is more than you need.. Most processed foods have added sugars. Even if you only had one can of coke a day you would still be healthier with out any coke or soda.

cycling,fd6ce3w,t1_fd4fc2d,1578188823.0,Its because american drivers are so used to having lanes as wide as highway lanes that anything smaller is considered unsafe. I cant tell you how many time I have almost been hit by people that dont want to be to close to the center.
cycling,fd6buef,t1_fd4bgsf,1578188588.0,I actually had a driving instructor say that pedestrians are supposed to go against traffic because if a car does something dangerous you atleast have a chance to see it and react. He didt understand why bicyclists where not supposed to do the same.

postmates,fcztju8,t1_fczlrrd,1578108365.0,"Realtalk thought if you job requires anything at all you should get pretty good at maintenance for it. Most tools you need can be borrowed at o'reilly's with only a security deposit that you get back completely on return. Tires on cars I understand, but frankly if you can not or refuse to do your own maintenance then get a job that does not require your car for more than commuting because YOU WILL HAVE MORE MONEY. Post mates for me is only really profitable by bike in the city, and only because I do my own maintenance. You stand to make more at Starbucks where they will help with your health insurance, reimburse you for education at ASU, and even let you deduct money you spend on bus commuting from your taxable income."

comics,fcpijhp,t1_fcphrni,1577865220.0,"There is just alot of misinformation about why american(and any other developed country) are having more and more obesity problems. When the bigger problem is that we are not being as careful about the substance of what we eat. Soda is always bad for you no matter what your portion size is. All of these low fat foods are are empty calories or processed food are just not actually making people feel fool so they eat more. This idea that Americans ""just eat to much"" is wrong and the problem lies almost entirely in that processed foods are not good for us. And that the food pyramid that we all learned is inherently flawed. This is coming from someone that had to eat close to 4000 calories a day to not lose weight mainly because I stayed away from foods that where not sustaining."
Games,fcpfsec,t1_fcpf6nj,1577862058.0,"And frankly that is still the house developers fault.  If they wanted a house to be built well they should have paid more. Otherwise it's there fault for cheaping out. Yeah its suck for whoever ends up living in the house but if the developer is not paying the construction workers enough to have the right amount of people, or to use the best materials, then they are only getting what they payed for."
comics,fcpf29y,t3_eiep94,1577861184.0,You know I feel this whole portion size debate is leading to a lot of bad information being spread around.  If your working a physical hard job or working out  even a little bit the portions on a box are tiny. Frankly people just need to stop eating empty calories like nonfat milk or foods loaded with sugar and most peoples body's are pretty good at figuring out how mutch you should eat.
Games,fcpd4zn,t1_fcpb9s7,1577858962.0,For the dev the publisher is the customer. Think of it as more like if a housing developer stopped paying the construction workers. It's the housing developers problem if the construction doesn't get finished.
