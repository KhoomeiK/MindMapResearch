apexlegends,fc4h4kl,t1_fc3f5ai,1577416496.0,"SBMM doesn’t affect the majority in a negative way tho. Just the vocal minority at top 10%. Don’t know what good 10% of the community leaving will do. The loud opinions on here will sure have some impact, don’t get my wrong, but it won’t mean as much.

It’s just like fortnite, and every other game that introduced SBMM."
