I also learnt that they could veto laws by not signing the bill, although no one's done that before? Maybe they are more powerful than I thought."

Something batted at his face. Mouse opened his eyes, blinking at the tiny creature that dared disturb his slumber. For a moment it had soft, vulnerable skin and warm, delicious blood flowing underneath and a tiny, bright mind that he longed to poke at. Then Mouse blinked, and the dream-memory faded and there was a tiny orange kitten looking down at him in curiosity. 

Mouse cuffed the kitten lightly with one paw. The creature fled squealing with excitement. Not scared. Disappointing.

The part of Mouse that was Cat was irritated. The part that was Other wanted to scream its fury at being woken.

But they were both small sounds. Annoying, but quiet. Almost a dream. There had once been a Cat. There had once been an Other. But now they were Mouse. And Mouse didn't have to listen to the Cat or the Other.

He rose from the cooling floor. The sun had moved from his nap spot. That meant it was time to patrol. Mouse stretched. He needed to be ready to pounce.

Mouse strode idly, surveying his territory. He ignored the Food Place. The human Doris wasn't in there and she put the food into the Cold Box or the locked boxes when she wasn't there. Not that it could stop Mouse. He was quick, like the Cat, and clever, like the Other. But it was effort and Doris might get screechy.

Mouse absently flicked his tail as the orange kitten began to pace at his side, imitating the light sway of Mouse's tail and the tilt of his head. The creature was small and irritating, but persistent. The Other didn't like that. The Other had been woken by small, irritating and persistent creatures. It had been pulled here, and then it had been put into something small and irritating and persistent that had fought and fought and fought. Sometimes it had been itself. Sometimes it had been Cat. And then both had become Mouse and Mouse hadn't liked the humans that had put the Cat and the Other together.

Mouse's whiskers twitched and he snapped to attention. They were nearly at THE THING. Mouse didn't like THE THING. It didn't obey him. He had tried to catch its attention more than once and he had failed. There weren't many things that didn't obey Mouse and he liked few of them.

Ginger was at THE THING. She sat under it, purring with pleasure as THE THING lightly scratched her back. THE THING was magic. Mouse knew that. Pebbles had said so and Pebbles was smarter than Mouse. Pebbles was not Cat and not Other and not human and he was smarter than all of them. And scarier. Pebbles said that THE THING was magic and the magic ignored Mouse because Mr Fuzzyfeet asked it to.

Fuzzy also didn't obey Mouse. Mouse really did not like that. And Fuzzy would be smug if he knew how much Mouse didn't like that, so Mouse pretended that he didn't see THE THING as he walked past it. He wouldn't let Fuzzy see how much he irritated Mouse. But Mouse dig out one of Doris' smelliest socks and leave it in Fuzzy's bed. That would teach him.

The orange kitten hesitated for a moment at THE THING, torn between getting scritches and following Mouse. But only for a moment. Then she was at Mouse's side again. It surprised Mouse how much that pleased him. The Cat would have been irritated. The Other wouldn't have cared at all. But Mouse was becoming something that was neither and he didn't know how to feel about that. So he just slowed his pace to make sure the kitten wouldn't fall behind. 

Anyway, they were nearly outside now and Doris would leak salty water if something tried to eat the kitten. The little thing had no sense of danger at all. It poked at and followed Mouse after all. He should keep it close and make sure it stayed alive.

No. Maybe he should teach it to stay safe. He could smell a familiar foe. The beefy bulldog walking past his house and its beefy human would be the perfect prey for the kitten to practice on. Plus it might be funny to see the dog run up a tree. Yes. It was time to terrify the dog again.
