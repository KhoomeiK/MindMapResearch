* Infinite bottles of beer on the wall. Take one down, pass it around.
* Infinite bottles of beer on the wall.

I was impressed that he didn't try to do ""infinite minus one"", as most of his peers would."
HomeImprovement,fgl1r1q,t1_fgkp21n,1580879336.0,"If they didn't sand all the old paint off, there still is plenty of lead paint on those floor boards.

Unfortunately, if the new paint doesn't adhere, painting another coat won't fix anything. It'll just come off again. In the past, there might have been the option to skip some of the sanding. Now, there isn't."
HomeImprovement,fgkzy1l,t1_fgkzmkw,1580877859.0,"Ah, good to know. I was just a little disturbed by what looked like plain old cabinets everywhere.

I like hoods that extend all the way over the front of the frontmost burner. But with induction (which you seem to have) you can sometimes get away with smaller integrated hoods"
HomeImprovement,fgkz3rp,t1_fgjs7v1,1580877200.0,Do you really have no vent hood in all this open concept space? Or does it just not show on the pictures
HomeImprovement,fgkq6dt,t1_fgkolb3,1580871169.0,"That's true. Hadn't thought of that. But you're right, plaster is more annoying than sheetrock. In fact sheetrock is so easy to work with, it's really a non issue to make minor changes to your walls. The same isn't true for plaster"
immigration,fgkg0o4,t1_fgkd6ad,1580864697.0,"Thanks for the correction. I didn't realize it was only so few.

Oh, and while talking about funny special cases, I think one way to avoid some of these taxes would be to establish residence in Puerto Rico prior to moving out of the US. But that's probably wildly impractical for most people"
AskReddit,fgk6uu8,t1_fgjw9ld,1580858744.0,"You want honest answers, which is hard to get, as the interviewer has a vested interest in making the company look as favorable as possible.

So, asking questions that are expected to get somewhat negative responses is great, as it gives the interviewer less of an incentive to whitewash their answer.

Another good one is ""tell me what you most dislike about your job"". It's open ended, puts them on the spot, and they know that if they lie too much you simply won't believe them. It's the reverse of the dreaded ""tell about a time when you made a mistake"" question, that so many candidates struggle with.

Or similar: ""If there was one thing you could change about your job, what would it be?"""
immigration,fgk50r9,t1_fgjsc43,1580857626.0,"Downvoting me, because you don't like the message is really silly. That doesn't change the laws, nor does is change just how aggressively some of these laws are enforced. California is particularly strict in their enforcement and I know several people who were caught by surprise.

On the other hand, if you think that what I am saying is actually wrong, then maybe follow up with a comment pointing out my mistake. That's always welcome -- and it is infinitely more helpful to /u/JustATemp614 than downvoting me."
HomeImprovement,fgjy3j2,t1_fgjx2a6,1580853654.0,"All the open showers that I have seen and that worked, had a relatively small opening for you to enter/exit, but were enclosed on the remaining sides. They also usually moved the opening as far away from the shower head as possible. And the floor was sloped gently (too little to notice unless you knew what to look for).

None of that is rocket science. But its apparently sufficiently complicated that it does require an actual designer or architect instead of a home owner whose sole education came from HGTV"
HomeImprovement,fgjv0m6,t1_fghvmnz,1580851925.0,"That's just poor design.

There absolutely is no excuse for getting water all over the place, no matter whether there is or isn't a door. This is very much a solvable problem.

Heat retention is a little more tricky to do right, but even that is doable. I have stayed in several places (both hotels and AirBNB) that got this right."
HomeImprovement,fgjupwc,t1_fghddtn,1580851760.0,"It depends a lot on the overall design of the shower stall. I have stayed in hotels that have open walk-in showers and that worked beautifully. Absolutely no loss of heat.

I have also stayed in places that clearly could have used the help of a competent architect."
HomeImprovement,fgjufrb,t1_fgix62f,1580851603.0,"A wall is ideally just some sheetrock and a little bit of framing. Super easy to open and to close again. It only gets complicated, if there is lots of plumbing/electrical involved, or if it is a load-bearing wall. And even that is generally a solvable problem.

People have way too much respect of walls. There is nothing magic or complicated about them. Easy to remove and easy to install."
HomeImprovement,fgju96e,t1_fgisnlz,1580851504.0,"If you go to all this trouble, don't skimp on the hardware. Cheap hardware might be less than $50, but good hardware isn't really **that** much more expensive. And it makes a huge difference."
HomeImprovement,fgju55y,t1_fgilim5,1580851443.0,"It the walls have no mechanical parts (i.e. plumbing, electrical, ...) in them, then opening the walls and installing the pocket doors is usually really straight-forward. A little more tricky for load-bearing walls, but still doable.

For a non-load-bearing wall, this isn't even a big project. A handyman could easily crank that work out in a weekend. Hell, you could even DIY."
HomeImprovement,fgjty4o,t1_fgjexc9,1580851336.0,"The load bearing part is usually doable. You need a bigger header, and you might need an engineer to sign off on things.

But the mechanical part is the killer. Sometimes there really is no way you can relocate that waste stack anywhere else."
HomeImprovement,fgjtp54,t1_fgj1c2b,1580851200.0,"I love the pocket doors that we put into our house. The space savings are very real. And they don't look tacky. They just look like doors.

But I would not want any barn doors. Just not the æsthetic that works for our house."
immigration,fgjsc43,t3_eyw8w7,1580850433.0,"Please be really careful with this. As a green card holder, you need to report taxes on your world-wide *income*, no matter where you live at the time. You also need to report your world-wide *assets* (savings accounts, brokerage accounts, property, retirement accounts, other guaranteed benefits, ...). Failing to do so can quickly cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties. And as with most tax-related things, there usually isn't a statute of limitations. So, this will haunt you for the rest of your life.

And of course, if you ever planned on getting US citizenship, this will be a huge hurdle to overcome.

If you are lucky, there is a tax treaty between your wife's home country and the US. If it happens to apply, it can reduce the tax burden. But the devil is in the details, as the US doesn't treat all assets and investments the same as other countries. This is particularly problematic with retirement accounts and with real-estate.

See a professional before making your decision, and make sure you absolutely file your taxes each year, even if you don't owe anything. Filing is really important; this is doubly-true for the declaration of your foreign assets.

And this is not even talking about state taxes. Many states will keep collecting taxes even after you have moved outside of the country. Your last state of residence is usually entitled to these taxes, and it is extremely difficult to get out of this obligation; it is almost impossible to do so, if you plan on keeping your green card or returning to the US (even just for a visit). And to add insult to injury, tax treaties don't protect you from state taxes. So, you should assume that you will definitely owe those. If you happen to live in a state that lets you out of that obligation, consider it an unexpected windfall."
