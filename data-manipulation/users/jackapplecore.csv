Showerthoughts,fgsz4g2,t1_fgsworz,1581095669.0,"I didn’t. I just pulled a funny look. My side of the convo was pleasant. Don’t assume. It stayed a positive experience for my son. As his dad, that’s my primary goal. Keep him safe, happy and learning. I’m aware it’s statistically untrue that cops are all bad. It was equally weird to have had someone open with that. It wasn’t even on my mind at the moment until he said that."
Showerthoughts,fgsui07,t3_f0aqj1,1581092923.0,"Had my son at a library once and a police officer was nearby ticketing a person for running a red light. Hes two and of course he likes big, shiny, blinky things.  So I walk him over to the motorcycle so he can take a look. The cop finishes writing the ticket, returns to the bike, looks at my son and says 'Good! There's no reason to be afraid. We wont hurt you.' Completely unbidden, triggered or otherwise brought on by any actions or words of my own. He brought it up out of the blue to a kid and his dad just looking at a cool motorcycle. I gave him a funny look and moved on to asking if he had a sticker for my son.

I wondered. They are aware they scare people. Otherwise he wouldn't have opened the conversation like that. Awkward to say the least. But it says a lot about police/public interactions if the cops are already expecting random people to distrust them. Already on the defensive from the get go. My son didn't care. He got a sticker. But it bothered me.

I don't appreciate cops the way I need to. He didn't help my view of them."

CPTSD,fgstnqx,t3_f07kn9,1581092423.0,"All the time. I'm saying the things I was too afraid to say because of the potential backlash. Its saved up hate and anger and righteous indignation and all that good stuff. Usually in the shower or worse, at the wheel. I've had to pull over as if she was in the car with me just so I could breathe and calm down. Yelling, screaming!"

That was tough. But life got tougher. She’ll need lots of support for a while after that. Without it, someone does end up there."
abusiverelationships,fgsn7ad,t1_fgsblut,1581088399.0,Could be. I’ve questioned my own reality in the face of her ranting and haranguing.  Been 5150’ed before?
carporn,fgrtr7n,t3_ezxjao,1581057270.0,"I remember when the Dodge Viper first came out. They made a big ballyhoo about it having 13 inch rotors up front. Now that doesn’t seem so exotic.

This makes sense. I read somewhere that it’s good operating practice to engineer brakes that exert a stopping force at least six times greater than the engine can produce power. Don’t know where I read it. Can’t back it up. But it seems to make sense."

abusiverelationships,fgq8q4o,t3_ezwxt1,1581019955.0,"She’s so perfect in public, she never shows the person I lived with for eight years. She’s flashed it in front of her folks and other relatives. But in public, creative Verbal denigration, discounting my life experiences, criticizing me through the kids (this happens a lot in public) With a more degrees than a thermometer, she always seems able to creatively make it look normal. At home she used the threat of divorce to silence arguments and make me acquiesce. When we finally did divorce, she started holding the kids over my head when we argued over something minor. She’d never do that in public. She routinely ramps up her anger to 100 in private but in public, she’ll find creative ways to get her barbs in, then unload with both barrels once in the car or if we cross paths caring for the kids."

Ahh California St! There’s a great Italian restaurant you should visit. No worries, it’s on the ground floor. Perbacco. $$$$. But worth it. They make their own cured meats and their gnocchi is peerless. 

Now, if you want to feel safe at height, the 63rd floor of Salesforce tower is accessible to the public. It helped me. Still afraid. Just less anxious."
