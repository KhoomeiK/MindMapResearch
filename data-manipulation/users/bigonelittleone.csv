namenerds,ffv20pm,t3_evdkeh,1580253860.0,"Honestly I think what the parents call the child at home / what the child themselves wants to be called dictate the nicknames, unless they are painfully obvious. I know two charlottes neither of which was *ever* shortened to Charlie. They occasionally got Charl (pronounced Sharl) but not often. I also know a lot of Matthews who never got Matt, Nicholases who never got Nick and Samanthas who never got Sam. If you introduce your baby always as Charlotte and when she talks, she introduces herself as Charlotte, I would struggle to imagine people calling her Charlie of their own accord"
namenerds,ffv1fiq,t1_ffuz6mz,1580253478.0,I actually love just Wolf with Jude and Cohen!
namenerds,ffv12kr,t3_ev6zi6,1580253245.0,"Bexley, Bankstyn, Baylor, Bradley and Burns are by far the worst on this list

I also hate that “y” is just thrown in there and pronounced as if it’s spelled correctly. If Camryn were pronounced Cam-Rin I’d be more forgiving but I can almost guarantee it’s pronounced Cameron against all common sense."
namenerds,ffuzunr,t1_ffu2vc4,1580252527.0,That’s so interesting! I wanted to find out more and found [this article](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/deepbaltic.com/2016/09/23/why-you-will-almost-definitely-have-to-change-your-name-when-speaking-latvian/amp/) really enlightening on the topic of Latvian naming conventions!
namenerds,ffuyfpq,t3_ev951t,1580251738.0,"I feel like the first letter of the middle name is *so* not enough of a theme to push through with if you’re not crazy about any of the names! Just pick something that is meaningful to you as a couple, honour a family member, pick something that has a meaning that you love, or something that you think sounds nice with the first name! Don’t just name her something you dislike just because it begins with an A. I also personally think that following a name that ends with a vowel with a name that starts with a vowel always sounds a little off."
namenerds,ffuxnux,t3_ev9il0,1580251310.0,"Is Ashe pronounced more like Ash or like Asha?

I was going to suggest Alaska but on second thoughts paired with Winter it possibly becomes a bit “snow themed” haha.

Edit: also I notice everyone has assumed this is to name a little girl - OP is that correct? Ashe Winter could very feasibly be a baby boy’s name"
namenerds,ffuwrlq,t3_ev27wx,1580250817.0,"My friend just called her newborn Alma - I think that fits really nicely with your girls’ names! Ruby is also one of my favourite names of all time, along with Lucy/Lucie."
muacirclejerk,ffq3n1l,t1_ffpli62,1580118623.0,"I don’t have as many as 50 but I have 11 face brushes (each for a different product) and then probably 20+ eyeshadow brushes, some of which I have multiple that have the same function but I use them for different colours"
entertainment,ffq0n2y,t1_ffpxy7u,1580113952.0,That’s disgusting.
entertainment,ffq0kor,t1_ffpv5iv,1580113850.0,"I hope so. When I first read that he and his daughter died in a helicopter crash, I imagined plummeting to the ground and it being a terrifying and painful death. It’s much nicer to hope they had no fear and it was over quickly."
todayilearned,ffpzt0t,t1_ffpznar,1580112765.0,Goshhh that seems like such a difficult language to learn! Especially from a western perspective where there is no ability to ‘guess’ at a pronunciation due to the completely different alphabet. Thanks for explaining! I can also see why Ariana would think it meant “7 rings” which makes the title here seem a little unfair.
todayilearned,ffpzjv4,t1_ffpz5zp,1580112414.0,Thanks!
