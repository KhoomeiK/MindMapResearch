When I was getting out late 2014 - early 2015, they were trying to cut down troop numbers. They even had programs to involuntarily separate enlisted members if they had some paperwork on them. I wanted to stay in and re-enlist, but I was given a ""Not eligible for re-enlistment"" and had to separate.

TAPS never once mentioned to us how much better it would be to stay in during this time, they knew it would be insulting as hell so they really strove to help make the transition easier."
