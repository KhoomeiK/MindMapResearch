SocialistRA,fez3iz3,t3_eqrsvr,1579453556.0,"Here is their statement:

""The Metro DC chapter of the Socialist Rifle Association urges all members to stay away from Richmond on January 20th. It was decided that we would not coordinate with the groups going on the 20th for a number of reasons – mainly, half of those groups would see us dead if they could. There is no good in putting a visible target on our backs just to make it easier on those who would. While as a chapter and as individuals we will not be at the rally, this does not mean that we are not involved in the fight for gun rights in Virginia.
With the announcement of the arrests of 6 members (2 three-person teams) of The Base who were planning on attacking the rally this week, this caution has been justified. The politicians in Richmond would see us disarmed in the face of rising fascist violence against our communities.
To combat this, we have been working for months on coordinating and pooling resources with our chapter members and other left-of-center and minority gun organizations in the state to schedule meetings with State Delegates, Senators, or their aides.
Frankly, the immediate push for gun control before literally any other initiative is abhorrent. We have seen time and time again the Democratic obsession with gun control, no matter the cost, no matter the effectiveness. This has led to them losing control of legislatures state and nationwide for decades. Instead of focusing on helping, this single mindedness kills off any hope for further social justice/equality/progress, and cedes ground to conservatives who pay lip service to firearms while cutting the social safety nets and enriching themselves at the expense of not only the current working class, but their own children’s future. 
We have signed onto a joint statement with other leftist organizations in Virginia that goes into more detail https://nrworkerspower.com/2020/01/17/arm-the-people-not-the-state/"""

Even a .22 slug is going to hurt, and with a .22 you can pop off 2-3 rounds on target rapidly due to near zero recoil. You're unlikely to get into a sustained gun fight like in combat or a police shootout, so why carry a double stack if it's uncomfortable? Just my 2 cents."
