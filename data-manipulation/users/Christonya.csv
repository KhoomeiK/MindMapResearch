CruciblePlaybook,ffm143a,t1_fflvm2c,1580046808.0,That seems odd then. I imagine it wouldn’t work great since the target will take a big burst and then you have to draw your bow before being able to finish him.

Really for me it’s more preference. My gear as is is almost perfectly optimized while running mods / stuff that will be avail today, as well as next year today.  Rather then building an new set each season just to benefit from the seasonal mods."
CruciblePlaybook,ffcmb03,t1_ffcm3mr,1579802479.0,"Absolutely correct. Just keep in mind next seasons armour will be rolling with their own mods, and they will drop with higher base stats. So the dawn armour will eventually fall off."
CruciblePlaybook,ffcm7m4,t1_ffchm0e,1579802422.0,"Well for a titan, 35 mobility with traction should be more then enough, unless you still feel sluggish at tier 5. Resilience has a lot more power so you’d probably want close to 8, and recovery could be 2 or 8 depending on your subclass choice."

CruciblePlaybook,ffchdpd,t1_ffcguw6,1579799498.0,"I would have to double check to be 100% sure, but I believe the first 2 ( might be 3) tiers of resil give you the most power per stat until like, 7-10. So unless you hard stack resilience those middle levels drop off in power per point. Combine that with a hunter (who will likely avoid most damage via mobility) and you’re pretty much where you want to be with just that tier 2."
CruciblePlaybook,ffcgxcp,t3_estjg2,1579799219.0,"The reason why I’m ignoring it; next season, we will likely get new season based armour... which won’t be able to even use it. For pve, sure I can see it’s benefit, but for pvp? Would rather use the mods I’ll be using next season anyways."
CruciblePlaybook,ffcgpeb,t1_ffce9zw,1579799082.0,"A suggestion, when turning in gunsmith materials keep an eye out for elegy with a snap roll. Not a sniper people usually talk about, but I have a sneaking suspicion it might be the best energy sniper in the game when god rolled. 

Also for gear, you’re basically looking for 6-9 mobility, 2 resilience, and 18-22 recovery. With that getting 80 recovery (which is really all you need) and 100 mobility is pretty doable. Mods go to mobility, and the 2 (4 masterworked) resil is enough to get you to 16, so a single item with 6 resil hits that tier 2 breakpoint. Then your secondary stats go to int / disc depending on play style."
CruciblePlaybook,ffce4ag,t3_esug59,1579797494.0,"Currently all my gear has high regen, medium mobility, and then a mix of disc / int. Doing so with traction and mobility / recovery mods, depending on my exotic I have 100 mobility and any where from 80-100 recovery. So more optimized gear is probably your issue there. 

As for snipers, I hear all the time “choose what fees best to you” the only exception I see there is snapshot, just because that snap scope is often the difference between a kill, or a miss."

Lately I’ve been messing with weapon rolls (as I’ve gotten to the stage where I want to min / max that aspect of my character now) and what I’ve found, is if you go to light.gg, most weapons will have recommended perks for each activity, as well as just displaying them all along with the hidden stats of the weapon.

1. While invisible your super lasts DRAMATICALLY longer. 
2. While outside of stealth you are super squishy. 

When I play wraith, my goal with my super is to scout, and flank. I’ll use my radar to gauge where players are, and then super to flank them. 

On a single enemy, I will always use my right click (heavy) attack. This is partially because it flings me in the air (to hit titans / warlocks that try to fly away) but also because it will OHK and keep me in stealth, which as I mentioned, let’s my super last significantly longer. If there are two enemies, I’ll use my light attack to gap close / kill the first guy and the heavy for the second. 

If there are two players in close proximity, I’ll also heavy attack to kill both of them.  Basically if you will go more then a few seconds to find your next target, heavy will almost always be better to keep your supers duration up.
