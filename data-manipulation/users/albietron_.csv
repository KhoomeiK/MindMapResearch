The biggest gain was just to accept that it is okay that I am this way and there is nothing wrong with me. I accept I am quite and that is fine. In doing really well now in social situations and don't feel anxious at all. To be be honest I still don't like social situations very much but I can cope better.

The harbour can be interesting as well (Biggest harbour in Europe if I'm not mistaken) I think you can book touring boat trips.

Amsterdam is really close by and has a lot of good museums as well (Stedelijk museum, Rijksmuseum and van Gogh museum) There is a lot of great historical architecture in the city centre canals etc. The zoo is really nice as well but maybe not the time of the year.
