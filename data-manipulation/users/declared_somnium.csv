As callous as it does sound, the mental health side is the local authority. If they have a work coach, then they can often catch it, and make these referrals. The case manager doesn't have that level of contact. I could have sat across from any of the claimants I oversaw, even the ones who needed regular contact (and I did have a few). They'd never even know I was their CM, and there would only be one person I'd tell. They were an awesome person who had to have their housing element recalculated because the calculation software wasn't smart enough for their situation. They were never angry about it if I missed it, and the payment was short.

Nope, because they aren’t allowed to do so by law. Data Protection and all that. Is the case manager, work coach, or decision maker, magically able to know where a person is at all times.

I heard some doozies, but if a person said it was for hospitalisation, the procedure never goes near a sanction.

You get three good causes to fail to attend. If you miss and get three in a row, then it does go to a decision maker, but that’s not an instant sanction.

Can be done in the job centre or over the phone. But the key thing here is that the terms are agreed on before hand.

Work coaches and case managers are pretty chilled and have seen and heard some shit, trust me. They will be nothing but understanding if you even so much as utter the word anxiety.

It can even be listed in the fucking application. Any work coach will see that and factor it in.

My cousin, well she’s got a problem in that she can’t seem to be happy being single and has an intense desire for that fairytale happily married life.

A few years back, she starts talking with this Mormon bloke and claims to be in love with him, has met him lots of times, spends hours on video calls with him and the like. After a few months, he proposes, and she sorts out her first passport, leaves her son with an ex boyfriend (he was as close as being this kids dad as possible) and swears up and down to the rest of her family that she isn’t going to get married.

First time outside the country, possibly first time she ever met this guy (she lies to us about this shit, a lot) and she gets married.

Before this, she converts to Mormonism and tells us how she feels so connected to them, which she hasn’t felt for so long (she never goes out, so kind of hard to feel connected) but still drinks wine and smokes.

She spends a while talking about being happily married and how she imagines her dad would be so happy for her. Spoiler alert, he wouldn’t be. He hated religion and Americans, and this guy was super religious and a yank, he’d be rolling in his grave.

About a year later, she’s in the process of getting the unconsummated marriage annulled. Straight up annulled, no divorce, just throwing the damn thing away.

There was also the time she got cat fished, one of the pictures featured on gay blogs for years and was of a body builder that was actually fairly local, and married with a kid. She claimed to have seen that guy. Who was a former soldier, firefighter, and a model. He did have a connection to the fire service, but he was far from a sculpted Adonis he pretended to be.

When you see a happy little puppy getting a bit agitated around an argumentative trio of kids, and she seeks safety in her cage. Well at times you kind of want to join her in there.

I’m also aware that not everyone who has a cage for their dog uses it in the way that my sister does, and I heartily agree with you, in those situations it is cruel to the dog, and your point was 100% true. I just disagreed with the sweeping generalisation.

My sisters dog is not mistreated, she’s not unhappy. She’s a loving little puppy that can get so excited to see her boys that she’ll have a little pee on the floor (we’re working on that) She’s a pampered little pooch that loves a good cuddle, and loves to chase balls. She’s also not thrilled with wearing a coat to go out for a walk at the moment, but the poor little thing starts to shiver.

She’ll also have a little tantrum if her bed has to be cleaned, by scratching at the plastic floor of her cage, huffing, and glaring at my sister, until she’s picked up. Then she will refuse to look at her.

She’s a happy little dog with her little space to sleep in. I can’t speak for the other people with dogs that use cages, but in this situation, she’s happy and loved."

My sister has a dog with a cage. By and large the dog is never locked in there, other than during meal times. That’s more to stop my three nephews feeding her something dogs can’t eat, rather than control her behaviour. At night, she will get locked in to sleep. When my sister and brother in law go to bed, though she will huff and groan until you do go to bed.

Let me also point out that said dog does genuinely like her cage. She can get peace from three boys in there, even with the door open. Since they all know that the cage is like her bedroom. She will go in and out of it whenever she wants.

During the day, since my sister doesn’t work, this happy little jack Russel gets to trot her sassy little butt where she wishes. She gets cuddles aplenty, and walks a plenty. Though she could do without rain, or mud, or scary things (read as everything, she’s a wuss saw her bark at a shadow, her own shadow)

The only time my sisters dog won’t willingly go into her cage is when said cage is in a car. It’s her place, her little room with her favourite bed that she stole from my cat, and some of her favourite toys too.

So please don’t make sweeping generalisations over dogs and cages. I’m not saying what you said is false, just that it’s not entirely true."

Apart from during meals. Since she’d pester for food.

During the quiet parts of the day, she demands cuddles, particularly if you have something warm she can cuddle up beneath.

Don’t think of it as a place of punishment, think of it as a tiny bedroom for a dog. Upon which, if she’s at my place for the night, my cat will sleep on top of, to remind that foul dog (his view, not mine) of her proper place.

She really does need that quiet little bed too, since my youngest nephew will not let the poor dog walk anywhere. He has to pick her up constantly. If she wants to go to bed, she will walk in to her cage, curl up on her nice soft bed, and huff and glare at you until you relent and go to bed yourself to let her sleep.

AskReddit,fddnu3c,t3_eklsip,1578319003.0,"I guess I was lucky. My dad cheated on my mum at least once before he ran off with his butch lesbian looking side piece that had the same name as my mum. My sister and I stayed with my mum, who never really went out with anyone after that. I think I was 5 when he left, and I have no memories other than a very vague one of when he got my sister and I some cats.

The sperm donor (as my sister and I have taken to calling him) had two kids with his new wife, and for a while we would visit my him. Right up until his wife hit me. I wasn’t very old, and I don’t really remember much. I think we were helping the sperm donor clean his minibus and I got a seat wet.

After that, we never visited again. He was invited to the christening of two of his three grandchildren, and my sisters wedding. (We know he got the wedding invitation because I posted it through his door myself) When he didn’t show up, he wasn’t invited to the christening of grandchild numero tres.

Of his two new kids (my step brother and sister) My step sister was emotionally abused by the side piece, and told that we wanted nothing to do with her for years, with the step brother joining in. Her mother is a petty and spiteful woman, and my sister has perfected the use of facebook to piss her off. She’s a coward that only uses words now that we’re older and bigger. If she ever raised a hand to my sister or I. There would be a three fold response from My sister, my mum, and myself. No internet tough guy intended, but I’d love a reason to punch that bitch.

In 2019, she got in touch with my sister to tell us all of this, and that she had had a baby and was away from her POS parents with a loving boyfriend and his supportive parents. I can’t imagine the courage it took for her to do this, but she was rewarded for it. My family accepted her with open arms, and my sister and her three boys love her little boy, and are more than happy to babysit him. He’s a sweet kid, and she landed on her feet. With two families that care about her and love her.

As for the sperm donor. Well other than his dads funeral (which is another story entirely, dude was an habitual liar), and his mums funeral (my grandma, a fucking legend that sided with her grandkids over the entire cheating shit) over the last five or so years. He’s said maybe ten words to me since I was 19. I’m 30 now.

So, of the two options, looking at all of the other replies on here, I won the damn lottery. If only my step sister didn’t have to take the brunt of it.

Oh, besides the fact that his wife looks like she prefers women, the sperm donor looked like an 80’s gay porn star. The more I learn about him, the more I regret that he’s related to me, the man is the living embodiment of scum that advocated killing his own mother when her Alzheimer’s got bad, just to stop her being a strain of society. He also advocated killing kittens and puppies, in case you guys really want to hate this fucker."

I’m also kind of hamstrung by the official secrets act, so gotta be careful lest I fall foul of the law. Plus, even though I haven’t worked there in nearly a year now, this person still makes me angry.

To summarise what that phrase was, the benefit I worked on, the statement would show a deduction of X that was made because a different (and older) benefit had paid it before. It can be very baffling, but in these situations a person is no better, or worse, off payment wise. This person thought, because it was showing as being taken away on one system, it was just gone. I honestly can’t think of a good analogy for it.

The payments made by the system I was one were broken down into different elements. Standard Allowance, the portion offered to everyone (this portion was where most deductions were made. You have a debt from housing arrears, a sanction, utilities. Those get taken from there, up to 40%) I won’t say how much was supposed to be paid since that can be identifying, but with all of the money from other debts, we were taking the full 40%. Some of those were sanctions, basically the punishment used by the system I was on. These were in place because somewhere in the fuck up of a system we used, they weren’t put in the right category. They were told to look for work, even though they couldn’t due to their situation. They were being appealed, but that was one for each of their many punishments. Since this is the government, it was slow going.

Then you would have other elements dependant on your situation. So housing, medical, children, childcare (those two are different) For debts, we were not allowed to touch these. 

However, if a list of other, older, benefits are paid still (things like Carers allowance, Industrial Injuries Disability Benefit, and a few others) Those fell under separate rules. As they were still being paid by the same company, as it were, they couldn’t be paid by us again.  So when the system I worked on (the newer benefit) calculated these payments. The money paid already was taken off, and it was taken from the whole.

Reading that back, it still won’t make much sense, but fuck it. If you wanna get a better view, look up what the government advises on Universal Credit, find an online calculator and play around.

I can understand why the person in this situation was so angry with us, and believe me, they were fucking furious, but it’s kind of hard to feel the appropriate feelings here when each month we get told that we can’t do our damn jobs, that we’re inept. When the shit that is holding it all up is beyond our pay grade, and trying to resolve it means talking with people that we can’t actually speak with directly, because it’s the government with a fetish for red tape.

You might want to skip past this since it devolved into a nonsensical rant. Might make your head hurt to read it, but damn did it feel good to get it out of my system. There isn’t a TL:DR. It’s just a lot of angry down there.

I’m not going to talk about this person, because it also reminds me of the people who would threaten suicide for an appointment, and then call up to complain after they hung up the phone, because we called the police and they broke down their door. It reminds me of having to tell a person that someone paid much more money than I am hasn’t made a decision on if you are unfit to work, even though I can see all of the fucking evidence, and it says right here that you can barely walk without your arsehole opening up and letting your fucking intestines fall all over the god damn floor. So we can’t pay you the money that you fucking need to eat and keep your house warm, or charge your fucking electric wheelchair up. Sorry, I’m not allowed to make that call even though I can see that the doctor has said, in fucking black and white, that they are not fit to work, and never will be. Nope, got to be the prick in another part of the god damn country that makes that decision, which is the fucking title of their god damn job, but the indecisive fuckers never have enough to make a decision even though they’d gotten everything they have ever fucking needed. It reminds me of having to call a person up to ask if they are going to be dead in the next six months, only for them to be a fucking smart arse and state that life is a terminal illness. Real fucking smart, arsehole, do you get how nerve wracking it is to have to ask that kind of shit?
