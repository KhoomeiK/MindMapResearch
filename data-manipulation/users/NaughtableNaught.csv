Mr Thanit is the Phuket Public Health Office Chief. He's not the doctor who treated Mr. Shorley, but a public official with a vested interest in Phuket province not being seen as a dangerous area for the Wuhan flu. Thai officials have not been too hesitant to lie in the past for similar reasons.

So, if you own a condo that you receive mail at, you're not a tourist, period, regardless of how often you visit? I disagree. Not everyone has a single permanent address.

As an aside, the word ""semantics"" does not mean ""irrelevant details"" or ""sophistry"". Meaning and definitions matter, important stuff shouldn't be decided based on ""I feel this is so""."

""Not living there"" is insufficient: each tourist is living at their destination while they're staying there, unless they happen to die. 

If you're visiting on a short package tour, surely you're a tourist, but beyond that, there are plenty of edge cases, so definitions are important."

Not in most countries at Thailand's level of development. 

You're right that immigration officials have wide leeway to refuse anyone for any reason. However, in developing and middle-income countries they tend not to be especially inclined to refuse entry at random to visitors from wealthier nations who broke no rules. The exception are a few places unsavory enough to deny entry for political reasons or to solicit bribes. 

In places like Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, Malaysia etc, if you come from a developed country, have a tourist visa or qualify for a visa-free entry, you won't be randomly refused entry no matter how many times you enter or how long you stay (as long as it's within the rules). Thailand used to be like this.

In developed countries where many visitors try to immigrate (and might claim public benefits), scrutiny is higher and there are more refusals. Usually, clear and sensible rules are followed (e.g. ""visiting too often"" is in itself not sufficient). Occasionally, xenophobic madness happens (e.g. Trump's Muslim ban)... but that's not an example for anyone to emulate.

> real tourists rarely are denied

This is a ""no true Scotsman"" argument -- if you were denied entry for any reason, you can't possibly be a ""real tourist"" (whatever that means)."
Thailand,fegzdzx,t1_fegyd4g,1579105899.0,That's not entirely uncommon on this subreddit. It's small enough that a personal grudge matters.
Thailand,fegwaia,t1_fegtfrt,1579103961.0,"That's an interesting find, but all we know is that 13 people being refused in a day was once reported on some local blog on a slow news day. 

It can't be concluded that that a similar or larger number of refusals would usually get reported or even that there weren't significantly more than 13 refusals on that day alone or on a typical day. 

In addition, this was just Suvarnabhumi, and there are 4-5 other major international airports in Thailand."

Do you know the number or percentage of people being denied entry? If so, please share it. To make the claim above, you must know it at least approximately. 

All I have to go on are fairly frequent online reports, but I don't know the official numbers, not even approximately. Obviously, the number of reports in a forum like ThaiVisa would be significantly smaller than the overall number of refusals of entry. It's important to note that such reports were almost non-existent before 2015 or so, and started picking up during Big Joke's crackdown. 

Perhaps some people embellish, but if you have a fair number of stories where before there were none, something is going on."

People are questioned and refused entry at airports for reasons along the lines of ""visiting Thailand too much"" or unsupported suspicions of working illegally, where criteria are not defined anywhere, not subject to review, and entirely at the whim of an immigration officer.

It's tempting to be in denial about this and try to come up with excuses as to why it'll never happen to me and how there must have been some unreported reason which doesn't apply to me... but doing that is ultimately delusional."
