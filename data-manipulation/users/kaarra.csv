DunderMifflin,ff8bu7i,t3_es7n3m,1579672226.0,I’d probably trade Creed for Jim and Gabe for Erin. Erin really grew on me. Packer is absolutely my top least favorite character but I also just don’t like the actor.

reddeadredemption,fewtk0e,t3_eqqtgs,1579419277.0,Did Westworld ever get better? I loved season one (mostly because of my love for RDR) but I just couldn’t get into S2 and now I find there’s going to be a S3.
