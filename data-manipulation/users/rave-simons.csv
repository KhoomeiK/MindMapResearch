rpg,felp769,t1_felagk2,1579227570.0,"I remember when I used to argue like this on the internet when I was younger. 

What I realize now is that it's so, so ineffectual. By breaking people's posts into little chunks like this, arguments inevitably dissolve into petty little fights over minutia. Missing the forest for the trees.

It also leads arguments to be far more about rhetoric than they are about a contest of ideas. Which isn't enlightening for anyone."
nottheonion,felkhqs,t1_fek6xqn,1579224352.0,Having a massive free trade zone and labor pool to pull from is a pretty big benefit to the wealthier states.

Like, what's the joke here? I'm such a terrible student and writer that the only way I could have gotten a good grade was by pandering?"
Games,fdj9olb,t1_fdj58j4,1578462529.0,"Saying we should consume more...

When the average American produces almost 3x the CO2 of the average UK citizen.

In the face of extreme global climate change that will define this century and displace millions. 

So I can own my own Radiohead CD? 

Like fucking, what."
Games,fdfcfcj,t1_fdda1eg,1578358404.0,"Owning your own things is often wasteful, expensive, and inefficient. It's an American ethic, just like over-consumption.

I could care less about owning most of my games. 95% of my steam games I've either never played or never touched after beating. I would probably have saved a lot through some sort of new rental service."
todayilearned,fcuxk2r,t1_fcushjq,1577990535.0,I am not saying that.
todayilearned,fcuqx17,t1_fcupj25,1577986689.0,"You know that realistic fiction is a whole very popular genre, right? More popular than scifi/fantasy?"
Friendsatthetable,fcb3suc,t1_fbdvytn,1577581984.0,Have you thought about hacking those mechanics into beam saber? I wonder if it would be easier to go in that direction than the reverse.
bladesinthedark,fcadf1o,t3_eguhzb,1577567309.0,"At the heart of this I think is the question of whether D&D has surged recently because of a particular cultural confluence or because 5e is such a good product. If it's the former, then any replacement rpg could maybe have taken its place with a strong enough brand and marketing in place. If it's the latter, the whole pie would still be very small without 5e.

But I don't think that's really a question you can answer through quantitative data."
Foodforthought,fcacufn,t1_fcaald1,1577566952.0,"Why do I even bother responding to people who's standard of evidence is Mel ""you look like a fucking pig in heat, and if you get raped by a pack of n***ers it will be your fault"" Gibson."
Foodforthought,fca7plg,t1_fc91iok,1577564311.0,"Palantirs business model is like selling missiles to the military. You know exactly what they're going to do and you either don't care or support it. Regardless, it bought your new Tesla."
Foodforthought,fca7fs6,t1_fc9k5xe,1577564188.0,"Peter Thiel vocally offered to make a Muslim registry for Trump years ago. This isn't an ""oops, didnt see that coming"" situation. 

This is a corporation headed by a vocal long-time conservative who supports these policies and who is directing his organization of amoral tech elite to enable them. Every person involved had full knowledge of what was coming beforehand or else their head was in the sand."
Foodforthought,fca6rtv,t1_fc98qdt,1577563894.0,Don't forget the amoral masses of programmers and data scientists (and personal assistants and HR people on and on) who do his bidding for a fat paycheck.
Foodforthought,fca6iyt,t1_fca3omi,1577563784.0,"I'd actually recommend being really critical of the ""died out from disease"" narrative. Native Americans died in such huge numbers from disease in large part because of displacement and disruption of life patterns that came with colonization. You're much more susceptible to disease if you're hungry, dehydrated, and don't know where the medicines are, after all."
