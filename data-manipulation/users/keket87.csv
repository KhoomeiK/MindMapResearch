fatlogic,ffr6bo7,t1_ffr4jjf,1580151401.0,Canada got Halo Top (somewhat) recently. I was so excited after listening to people rave about it. Only to be horribly disappointed when it was both expensive as hell and tasted terrible. I tried a few flavours but they all just tasted so artificial and the texture was awful.
fatlogic,ffqibmn,t3_etrtx3,1580135395.0,"I posted a week or so ago about my weight not budging despite daily exercise and what I thought was a small but reasonable deficit. Scale would not budge after 3 full weeks, not even the usual ""water weight"" loss that a lot of people get when cutting out junk food. Despite that, I wanted to be healthier and stronger so I kept at it. 

Over the weekend, the woosh started. I am down five pounds in about a month. CICO works people, do the work and give it time."
birthcontrol,fflyz0k,t3_eu586q,1580045891.0,"I had Mirena for 8 or 9 months I think, during which time I didn't have much in the way of bleeding but I did gain 15lbs and constantly looked bloated and pregnant. Switched from Mirena to copper in one day, lost the weight within 6 weeks without trying and immediately the bloating went away. My cycle went back to normal pretty quickly and I've had the copper since Sep 2018 and I still love just letting my body do what it wants to do."

fatlogic,ff6q2bn,t1_ff6f0zp,1579632505.0,">But I'm under no illusion that they're ""entertainment foods.""

I really like the phrase ""entertainment foods"". For instance, I spend 4 hours playing video games on a weekend, that's entertainment, it's not inherently super helpful to me as an organism. Likewise, cheesecake isn't inherently helpful as a fuel source, but it's enjoyable, so it's okay in moderation as entertainment."

AskWomen,feyc7o7,t3_equwgy,1579443624.0,"Extremophiles. Organisms that are capable of living under the most ridiculous conditions like high heat, high pressure, acid, etc. Knowing that some microbes can withstand and even thrive under punishing conditions gives us some indication if there might be life on other planets"
fatlogic,fesxp2n,t3_eqi4rp,1579369994.0,"I wish they'd stop pretending that genetics are a catch all get out of jail free card. Yes, there is a small percentage of people for whom genetics plays a role in increasing your likelihood of getting T2D. Unfortunately, this means the opposite of what they think it means. Instead of  ""oh but its muh geeeens!"" , its ""sorry, you have to work harder to avoid getting it"".

Diabetes is fucking serious. Can it be managed? Sure. But it's work. And anyone not working to manage it properly is going to eventually learn how serious it is. Ketoacidosis, neuropathy, cataracts, immune suppression, chronic infections, hypoglycemia, the list goes on. So if you're genetically predisposed to it, you need to be even more diligent about maintaining a good diet and execise and a healthy body weight."

loseit,femy8u1,t3_epxsyn,1579272690.0,"I feel like HAES has morphed over the past few years, or I just never knew what it really was to begin with.  I remember it being more about ""Hey, regardless of your weight, getting exercise and enough sleep, good nutrition like lean protein, complex carbs and veggies, drinking enough water, those are all good things for your body."" There was also a focus for health professionals to focus not just on the patient's weight when dealing with problems. Sure, less weight on that arthritic knee would help, but also here's a plan for physiotherapy., info on icing/warming, medications, etc. 

Now it seems like HAES is bascially ""I don't ever want to do anything uncomfortable because my body doesn't like it"" and that just feels really infantile."
