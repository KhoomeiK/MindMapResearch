In my state you need to have an attorney file for divorce on grounds of habitual drunkenness and request an emergency hearing asking for a temporary order.

They like for you to finalize the final divorce order/decree within a year after that so you’ve got some time for her to choose to get help or go through with it but that’s how you make someone leave who refuses.

I do not understand women who do not want to work at all. It’s a waste of a brain and earning potential to never work. I do understand mothers staying home while their children are small, I only worked part time until my son went to school. But I have plenty of time to work while he’s at school and I’m good at what I do AND I have turned into the breadwinner because of it.  Sometimes I don’t enjoy that weight on my shoulders but it still feels good to not have to rely on anyone. My husband does still work full time but his career is coming to an end while mine is ramping up. Maybe I would be resentful if I didn’t want to work but dang she had 25 years of freedom."

I didn’t think the rules were too unreasonable until you said you don’t get to keep the car. Totally unfair. I’ve been a teen driver and I’ve also gifted my teen son my car.

My parents had me pay for gas and insurance and the car was mine. I did drive my sister to school and our sports. I took my car to college and continued paying only gas and insurance.

I gave my son my car and he only had to pay for gas. When he moved out we did have him put the car in his name and get his own insurance but zero strings.

I’m kind of shocked your parents want you driving the siblings around daily. It took years before I let my son drive with his brother, it’s dangerous out there!"

My friends and I refer to our periods as “shark week” because it’s a bloody fucking disaster. My son overheard us say something about it and really wanted to know what we were talking about. I told him all the moms hate shark week on tv because it’s boring, sharks bite, sharks have lots of teeth, end of boring story. He nodded and went to play."

AmItheAsshole,fdm327b,t3_elv6ew,1578538633.0,"Nah but why were you okay with your income withholdings going to pay back child support? I would have thrown a fit in a CPAs office before now.

If you didn’t know you could protect your portion then I doubt the ex wife knew it either, she just wanted the child support paid.

I would have a professional file the proper documents to have your portion of the tax returns sent to you only AFTER meeting with a bankruptcy attorney.  It sounds like you’re insolvent so it’s possible a Chapter 7 would be fast and easy.  You need the bankruptcy attorney to tell you what to do and when with the tax refund and car.  See if there is any social security death benefit while you’re asking questions. He obviously worked long enough to pay in."

You are going to have to find a salon you can afford and tell her you’ve found someone that you want to try. And then never let her touch your hair again. I would have a different answer if you absolutely loved the results but do not compromise on hair that isn’t exactly how you wanted it."

This is the age when kids start making up ideas in their head about an absent parent. It was very good for you to be honest. Your mother isn’t wrong necessarily but maybe what she thinks is age-appropriate doesn’t match what you think your kid can handle.

My friend’s daughter started saying all she wanted was to see her father for her 8th birthday after not seeing him since she was a toddler. She was never told that he lived in a nursing home in another state because his organs were failing from alcoholism. Which pain is worse? Expecting your Daddy who you do not remember to show up at your birthday party or being told why he won’t? He died that year and she stopped worrying about him. You did the right thing."

It’s a rough life and we’re both glad he’s out but I know he misses it."
