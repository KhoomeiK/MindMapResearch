dogs,ff5djjx,t1_ff5d6dw,1579588382.0,"why not both? You definitely shouldn't tell a dog not to do something without teaching it a better option first, but dogs should also have some discipline in their life. YMMV."
dogs,ff5cht3,t1_ff5857n,1579587247.0,"Are you saying dogs don't learn consequences? He's not saying kick the dog if it barks, just tell it no and make sure the dog knows what no means. It's nothing crazy."
dogs,ff5bmv8,t3_erpfjz,1579586356.0,"Yes, but you should have someone/yourself come by in the afternoon to check on him and ensure he is comfortable/has water etc. Obviously don't leave him out in extreme weather or in an non secure area/tie out"
dogs,feivzbc,t1_fefz1iu,1579148710.0,"unfortunately it is in some cases. Petland, one of the largest pet retailers in the US sells their dogs from puppy mills. https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/2008-investigation-report-petland.pdf"
dogs,fefxc9l,t3_eov5o7,1579068311.0,"Prongs are great, but your pup shouldn't be yelping from one. Has he been acclimated to it? (Let him wear it and get used to it before attatching leash, play with him and give him some treats while he's wearing it etc.) also make sure it is properly sized, and if he's not pulling consider a martingale instead if slipping the collar is his only issue."
VetTech,fefx3y2,t1_fee8r55,1579068080.0,"Yeah I think animals on college campuses is a whole other thing.
I managed to have a malinois mix and my maltese with me in my dorm (legally) this year but that was a LOT of work and I honestly don't think most people who think they want to bring their pet with them would actually be willing to make the social life/time/financial sacrafices that come with that. 

My mali is no longer with me (fear biter..which I did not know when I got him) but my little one has been with me through hell and back. But I got her based off of my Dr.'s recommendation, not to try and skirt pet rules, I fully support assistance animals when needed and the rules are followed but the problem is it seems like only 2 other people actually do those things. I know a girl on campus who got a doberman puppy, and neglects it and now the puppy poops on the floor and bites anyone who comes over. I don't know how that dog is still here..yet i got in trouble for letting my roommate walk my dog while I was sick."
dogs,fefws2t,t1_feeu1zf,1579067755.0,"The dogs that are in those stores come from really horrible places called puppy mills, where moms and dads are kept in cages their entire lives and only used for breeding. Those dogs rarely if ever get veterinary care or walks, some never see sunlight or grass, they are usually not groomed or cared for beyond basic life support and making sure they can keep making babies for $$. A good breeder would care where their puppies go and usually would never breed for profit. They will advertise that they are USDA approved but the USDA minimums are very basic, allowing a dog to be in a cage barely larger than itself its entire life as long as it has food and water :("

HomeDecorating,fecmylq,t1_fe9saav,1578977933.0,I can cover the headboards with a sheet? I do have some all white sheets but they are all white so it might look weird. I was considering buying some fabric and attatching that to some cardboard for structure and placing it over the headboard but idk if that would also be weird/maybe stinky?? :o
HomeDecorating,fecmvfd,t1_fe9rpxj,1578977862.0,Yeah they stuck me in a really moldy room last year so I guess this is make up for that lol. Smart idea with the blanket and pillows..I guess that's a good excuse to buy more haha.

VetTech,fe9467x,t3_enzh6p,1578934035.0,"I think there's two kinds of fake service dog/esa owners and it's those that are selfish, and those that are uneducated, sometimes both. You can't fix someone else's personality but educational pamphlets could work wonders, along with good representation of what a service dog is supposed to look and act like. I would be happy to make some pamphlets if your clinic may be interested in this, or i'm sure there's many online."
VetTech,fe93xxj,t1_fe7x0w8,1578933931.0,There's a lot of shady programs out there unfortunately with not a whole lot of regulation that take advantage of the struggle disabled people/vets are going through and charge/fundraise insane amounts of money to give those people extremely subpar dogs. It's the worst kind of service dog fraud because instead of just one person being selfish it's someone directly taking advantage of others. I was unfortunately a victim of this scam too..it's really fucked up. :(

veterinaryschool,fe4ybcn,t3_enhz8e,1578863942.0,"If you can, YES!! That would make it so much easier to get experience in undergrad. Even with a lot of volunteer experience and letters of recommendation I struggled to get a job at a clinic and settled for shadowing, but why not get clinical experience AND get paid for it? Also, pursuing AP exams especially chemistry/physics will help you a ton."
Veterinary,fe4xpii,t3_enoozs,1578863820.0,"not a DVM, but maybe you could get a job helping out as a stable hand or something similar if you are worried about reputation. I agree with the other commentor that retail is too much work for not enough pay. Maybe working at a local coffee shop or something similar would be nice too? I work at Starbucks and there's some people that only work a few days a week or on weekends around here. The pay isn't great but there's bonuses and good benefits, and you will get a raise if you stick around."
dogs,fdyog17,t3_en9rmp,1578781949.0,"I think a big part of this controversy is that people believe their dog should never experience anything averse or unpleasant. This is simply not realistic or healthy. There isn't anything inherently wrong with using aversives if they are used humanely and within reason. The idea that dogs simply don't learn from aversives is wrong though. Think of it this way, if you let your kid touch a hot stove once, you have let the kid learn to not touch a hot stove. If you use a prong collar to correct a dog's pulling, it has learned not to pull. You wouldn't shove a kid's hand in the stove all the time to teach it not to touch the stove. Just like that, you shouldn't be correcting your dog all the time. If used appropriately, the dog has already learned. Keep in mind though some dogs may find a certain thing more aversive than others. My terrier couldn't care less about a choke collar correction, but many dogs would be very sensitive to this. So I use rewards and a vibration collar instead because that motivates her more. Some dogs don't care about the vibration or the food. Some dogs don't mind head collars which are frequently recommended over than prongs. If she could talk, i'm sure she would say she would much rather wear a prong than a head collar. The way I see it is use the method that works for the dog in front of you within reason, and don't correct a dog unnecessarily- especially if it hasn't been taught and rewarded for an alternate behavior and doesn't understand what you are asking of him."
dogs,fdyn2me,t1_fdyf9al,1578781554.0,ideal as in it feels better for the person training lol
dogs,fdld6uy,t3_elvk51,1578521506.0,"Not quite the same thing but in high school my maltese mix was working for me as my service dog. We had around 3000 kids, as it was a large public school, and I went to class just the same as everyone else. I left class about 2 minutes early just so she wouldn't get stepped on but I never really missed any material due to that, as my teachers knew I would leave early and give me anything I needed before I left. She laid down on a mat under my desk while I did my work and I would just fold up the mat and put it in my backpack to take it to each class. She came with me to everything pretty much, even school plays and presentations. 

During lunch time she would get a break and I'd let her run around the field or play with my friends while we ate. She was trained and socialized from 8 weeks old though so IDK if this would be as successful with an older dog, but she was about a year old when she started going to school with me. She's 4 now and we are in college, never had an issue except one time she got sick and my mom had to pick her up to take her to the vet but I think as long as the teacher can plan for that then it shouldn't be an issue. The only other problem I had was lab safety in anatomy class, but that just involved getting her used to booties and practicing her stay so she was safe from the cats being dissected, which was..unique to proof for lol. She did get overwhelmed by fire alarms but that's about it, and even then she was OK once we got outside. 

Honestly some of the kids in high school were super annoying about it and would try to distract her or ask invasive questions but that happens no matter what. She did really cheer people up and if possible I would always let someone play with her if they were upset. On a few occasions one of my friends or classmates would have some personal issue going on and I could tell they were upset or they left class due to an anxiety attack and I would bring pancakes over to cheer them up. She even got a photo in the yearbook and a buzzfeed article, so that was cool. I would say she definitely brought up the morale of students and staff, while a service dog isn't optional though a therapy dog is so it would be important to ensure everyone is comfortable with one around but it was a great experience. She's a therapy dog now instead and the rules are a bit different, the dog would have to be certified by a therapy dog organization usually involving a CGC and then additional training. The dog would also have to be older and up to date on all shots/preventatives/most likely fixed. Now is a great time to start training but I think that age is too young for a dog to handle a full day of school. That kind of environment requires a truly bombproof dog."
dogs,fdlank8,t3_ele34n,1578519986.0,I think your roommate is a straight up psychopath.
dogs,fdg30fl,t1_fdft2ir,1578378123.0,"Yeah it's not the dogs fault but it has already learned that it is OK to attack other animals and possibly people and the owners are willingly not managing that behavior. It being dead is not really such a horrible thing. There's plenty of dogs in shelters that don't bite people and deserve a good home, why not save those instead? A dangerous dog is fine if it has owners that are willing and able to manage it but a dangerous dog with shitty owners is just a recipe for tragedy."
dogs,fdc4icf,t1_fdaj8tu,1578266951.0,"I can't imagine not owning any of this equipment. My daily use is a leather buckle and lead but I love having the e collar for a backup around horses or off leash in public, and I use a prong and treat bag when we're at the vet or a show to make sure she is on her best behavior. 

Regardless of what anyone says about e collars, it will always be more humane to shock/vibrate her than let her get stomped on by a horse or hit by a car or whatever else. I rarely ever need to use it but I feel much safer having it as an option. 

Also love having a long line, cooling coat and sweater! Although my dog might be a bit spoiled with all the extra equipment I own lol"
dogs,fdc3umz,t3_ekiy42,1578266578.0,"It depends on the owner and their lifestyle. If someone is living on their own or feels like they could benefit from a dog for protection and doesn't mind using a muzzle in public and can safely manage a human aggressive dog, who cares if they own a Caucasian shepherd or whatever else for their own safety, it's a free country.

If someone is going to get a human aggressive dog as an extension of their ego and not manage it properly that's a whole different story."
dogs,fdc3jli,t1_fdbya9e,1578266404.0,"Listen I hear you on the fakes thing but this kind of passive aggressive rant post is really going to accomplish nothing. Nobody in this sub is supporting fakes, and most people doing this are either not aware what they are doing is wrong or just don't care. The best way to combat this problem is more education aimed at the general public and business owners, cracking down on the shady scam certificate websites, regulating what can be sold on ebay/etsy/amazon etc. and more strict legislation. Maybe create some flyers to pass out to local businesses where you've observed this problem, or avoid businesses who just don't care (Looking @ you walmart..) 

It's a very frustrating problem and I share your opinion but I think the best thing to do is channel those emotions towards something productive. Not trying to be patronizing here, just being real. Nobody has ever changed their behavior over an argument on social media tbh"

truelesbians,fccjtbo,t1_fcc6n84,1577599212.0,"That could really happen with any sexuality though. Before I figured out my sexuality I was dating a guy who I thought I was attracted to. Really I never got butterflies or fell in love though, I didn't realize I was only romantically attracted towards women and would only want to marry a woman, doesn't mean it was his fault or anything."
Veterinary,fc5tjaz,t1_fc532qs,1577465549.0,"Nope, that's why I'm asking here to get an idea of what the consequences could be. I am well aware of how lovely the DEA is, but I also don't see why they would randomly prosecute some DVM who hasn't done anything. If I were to be risking my patients that's another story but that's never something I would do. 

I am taking about using MMJ in my own time for a medical condition I have had for the past 10 years and will always have which makes my life pretty miserable without MMJ. I'm sure the DEA might have other opinions, but if they're involved already I think there's bigger problems on your plate."
