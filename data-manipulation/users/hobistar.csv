I mean they were announcers last time and now they even participated in a huge collab stage and did so well.
I'll support them as much as I can and hope for greater achievements as time goes by"

unpopularkpopopinions,feuyump,t3_epy054,1579391302.0,"I liked both versions very well. 

I don't want to refer to any given opinions before since I only want to voice my own opinion and don't want to invalid any others.

For the MV- version it was definitely something I would not have expected despite the hint at contemporary dance. I was pleasantly surprised for the musical composition as well as the visual presentation (choreography). 

What I really like about both versions is how the voices of the 7 members are heavily altered in a way that gave me the impression of an instrument instead of  human voices. In the MV- version it slightly contrasts the soft but yet jarring instrumentals, but still doesn't feel that out of place. Moreso an added instrument. In the audio version it's embedded into the more trap like setting, which resonates more than the other version and takes away the uneasiness that is represented in the first which makes it a lot more easy to listen to and even makes it more upbeat.

I could write more and more about the lyrics and the choreography but for now I'll break it here. As said before I like it really much and it increased my anticipation for the upcoming album. 

It's definitely something experimental and can or should be viewed with criticism and different point of views. That's what art is for in my perspective, in many forms and it would make it alot more boring if everyone had the same stance towards it."
depression,fet7tmx,t1_fepfqfp,1579372530.0,"This is exactly how I feel, passion, in no matter what kind of form, would give me a reason to look forward, a reason to take my time for something and feel at ease or even proud when I succeeded. But there isn't anything, like everything I do for now are things to just survive, everyday stuff to maintain my physical health but nothing that would go beyond that."
depression,fet5b47,t1_feofsg1,1579371944.0,To say sorry usually doesn't help a damn thing but I seriously hate to see someone else feeling the same shit like I do..

depression,fet3sjg,t1_fenu98u,1579371551.0,"I also like writing, it sucks that in your case others strip away your passion in some kind of way... I hope it'll fall into place someday for you"

kpop,feiav1q,t1_fehzf90,1579134198.0,Yeah that time a few hours ago when I actually thought I had a chance to even sit outside the venue lol but seriously I wish us lots of luck
depression,feeh3qt,t3_eojiuf,1579033629.0,... I kinda thought that's normal when I feel that way. As far as I remember I never experience it differently...
kpopthoughts,fdqppln,t1_fdqlmcn,1578672210.0,"Personally I would also like that. After I saw how the topic was handled I was a bit frustrated that it was dismissed in some cases as I said in my post too, it's rational and kind of necessary to remind where a fan stands and what kind of relationship it is between idol and fan.

And regarding your second paragraph, I can unterstand where you come from, with a group so big as our fandom it annoys how you basically talk into the abyss when addressing such sensitive topics. But I can also see that this would also be dismissed, in some way they already tell us to respect others, also other artists but sadly it's not executed that way... A direct addressing wouldn't hurt, that's right"
kpopthoughts,fdprwfc,t1_fdp34tf,1578638129.0,"Thank you for commenting and contributing to the discussion that kind of... Failed :D but especially your last sentence is what I would deem necessary in general, it's not bad to take a step back to criticize oneself or the bigger picture in general.
All in all I agree with you!"
kpopthoughts,fddvtut,t3_ekpkgb,1578325225.0,"I actually do, even though I know what outsiders can think of armys I don't see myself spoken to if someone calls a whole fandom toxic, when I know for a fact that it's not true. There are toxic people and I despise them but I found a great and joyful side to it that I cherish and try to preserve :)"
kpopthoughts,fddutsz,t1_fddb5wx,1578324522.0,"Exactly! 

For me that saying ""there always will be bad apples"" does not imply that therefore we should just let them be but moreso that they exist but you can't throw everyone into one bucket while it really isn't every single member of one fandom

 And sadly there is a correlation between how big a fandom is and how loud the toxic side of a fandom can get. It just makes sense the more people, the higher the chance for more bad apples (not saying that it's always given with an increasing fandom, but it can correlate!)

Sadly no one can really do anything against them, try to go against someone that toxic and you'll see yourself setting up new accounts because your old ones got reported, there is literally no way to civilly tell them about what they do wrong because you mostly talk against a wall."
kpopthoughts,fddtjlr,t3_ekslt9,1578323607.0,"I can totally understand you, I feel the same way. 

I personally don't invest myself that much to know any little detail about an idol and I will not let someone tell me that I should do that. The same with other things, hobbies, music, art and entertainment in general, they are there for your enjoyment. No matter how you consume it, in what expend you learn about it, the moment you find joy in it it's your thing. End of story."
kpop,fdcg8ux,t3_ekjsab,1578274145.0,"You've got so many comments but I still wanted to throw my coin in there too :/!

Well I would say I'm casual about it. If anything music related comes up or if someone sees my photo card and asks I will tell them that I like that certain genre and list a few artists, some unterstand it and some don't but at the end of the day nothing I would lose a second thought about.

With my family I'm a bit different, back then I remember showing my mom nct's debut song because I liked it so much, she didn't really care but after a while and a cinema visit she accidentally turned into a fan herself."
kpopthoughts,fci9k5t,t3_egn3dh,1577659412.0,"I love love love their song omgt, it's so catchy, found it randomly and since then have it in my playlist.... It upsets me how things turned out for them though... I didn't follow them that closely and only heard about their disbandment"
kpopthoughts,fcgvtjw,t3_eh0r6x,1577644433.0,"It's really hypocritical how so many literally anticipate the big reveal but in the same breath they want a more humane approach for stuff like that. 

I couldn't care any less and I only know about it because I have seen it mentioned in comments ect. But I know it will be so big that I can't even make my around it and that frustrates me. Even if real or not, it's not my cup of tea to know who dates who"
unpopularkpopopinions,fcawo2h,t1_fcaanr3,1577578089.0,"I feel so bad for them because seriously at first glance you didn't immediately notice someone missing and they just wanted to quickly translate the post for non Korean speaking fans.
 it's one thing to point something out but it's a complete different story to attack someone like that..."
kpopthoughts,fcavr6n,t1_fcar5ej,1577577569.0,I immediately thought of it as an anime opening too! Agree with you
depression,fak3r79,t3_e9jhrs,1576160330.0,"It frustrates me because, I know that there are people around me, I am not ""alone"" but I feel lonely and telling me the first won't make my loneliness go away.  

It's like a sticker they glue on your forehead while passing you, to say at least they did something to prevent your suffering."
