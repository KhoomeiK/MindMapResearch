It's good down to 5 degrees, which will be good for all but the worst day of the worst winters around here. (I've only seen it get that low a few times and only for like a day.) Right now mine is in a pot because I intend to move at some point in the not too distant future."
DFWGardening,ff23y8q,t1_ff1k3ka,1579493147.0,That sounds awesome. I'll be in touch. Thanks!

tumblr,fezvjnk,t1_fezlwbt,1579462210.0,Same here. Worked just fine.
DFWGardening,fezqw7v,t1_fezli28,1579460514.0,"Yes, unless you're willing to put in a bunch of extra care. 

If you're wanting a fruit tree in your yard there a options though. Apple and mulberry will grow well. Peach trees can do really well and I have a fig and a pomegranate tree. The pomegranate is the most cold hardy variety I could find."

DFWGardening,fezmus8,t1_fezl8hb,1579459130.0,I actually know of someone who has two lemon trees on their property here. They just wrap the trunk with an extension cord and put Christmas lights throughout the branches and plug it in when it gets too cold. The heat from it all is warm enough to keep the more cold hardy lemon varieties warm at our lowest temps.

DFWGardening,fezl2l7,t1_fewktox,1579458472.0,"That would be great! I have considered growing from seed, but it takes far longer to bear fruit and it may not even be similar to the avocados tree the seed came from, so I thought propagating would be a better route."

The north wanted to count slaves as part of the population for tax purpose, but not for representation in Congress. The south wanted the opposite. Hence, counting them as 3/5 of a person for each being a compromise."

AskReddit,fcyod9k,t1_fcyjr9n,1578083830.0,I just mean that you can't legally sell a body part and plasma qualifies for that. They get around it by paying you for your time and the plasma is considered a donation.
