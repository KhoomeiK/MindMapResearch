Idk what its name is in the community. Notable matchups are i guess yawn and ryu atm so i'll mention those, Yawn is beatable if we can buff something to absurd numbers with impulses since they don't have hard removal just seals so they will have to keep blocking which removes their MP advantage but overall i'd say matchup is in yawns favor 60/40.  Ryu is not that difficult to beat since our minions have huge health values which is hard to remove with just number based damage so i'd say that matchup favors us given that we start out well. And there are some lower tier leaders that i almost never lost to, such as nergigante and X. X is especially free because they usually buff up some small cost minion to big numbers and try to win that way but we have too many hard removals to answer that strategy and nergigante just can't keep up with how fast this deck plays."
hearthstone,ff6fxmq,t1_ff6d4l3,1579626341.0,"Games general model is far cheaper. Riot stated their way of monetizing the game mainly will be from cosmetics and not cards. You don't buy card packs as there are no card packs in the game you just craft what you want. And game has a leveling system for all regions in the game that keeps giving you cards and ways to craft whatever you'd like. You'll probably struggle a bit in the beginning but as you level having a sizeable collection shouldn't be an issue. Also same as hearthstone,if you start early in card games you tend to always have a large collection."
hearthstone,ff67dhs,t1_ff62alz,1579620883.0,"The RNG battling mechanic didn't really cause any problems. I played the fuck out of artifact when it came out and better player most of the time won the match regardless. There were ridiculous winrates going around where skilled players would get like 80+% wr. My gripe with the game was that cards were terribly designed and games powerlevel was overall ridiculously high. Artifact had insane board clears like 5 mana nether and late game ""i win"" cards that just dropped onto the board and annihilated the winning chances of your opponent while also having some insane aggro cards that allowed you to knock down a 40 health tower in the first 3-4 turns of the game. I loved the item mechanics and the turn priority system that forced you to think of all your 3 lanes simultaneusly instead of focusing on your 3 lanes individually but jesus fuck every card in the game felt terrible to play against. So many i win cards and so many game deciding RNG cards like that one card which prevented your guys in a lane from dying with 50% chance."
hearthstone,ff66o6r,t3_eru14m,1579620417.0,"Honestly, LoR looks way better at the moment and this is coming from someone who does enjoy current state of HS. HS threw away hand management and card advantage concepts in favor of discover and random card generation. LoR has more interesting minion combat because everything doesn't have rush and partial defenders advantage is in the game(unlike magic multiple units can't block one unit hence i call it partial) which makes attacking and defending deeper than HS' method of attacker chooses where to go. 3 different spell speeds is a very cool concept aswell which is something HS again doesn't have. LoR also doesn't have odd engine limitations of HS(such as being unable to target cards from your hand with spells or battlecries) which severely limits the developers design space. Something else i like is the leftover mana mechanic where you can store up to 3 mana in your leftover slot that you can only use on spell cards, which creates interesting situations where you might intentionally botch a turn to fill up the spell mana on turn 3 for example and on turn 4 play a 7 mana spell. It also gives you safety if you're playing control since control tends to float mana often and thats a good way ofensuring controls floated mana canbe used other turns on removing stuff instead of just going to waste. Another thing i have to give riot to is their balance philosophy and how often they patch up their games. If you play LoR expect a balance update once a month at the very least. 

I wouldn't ever say ""commit to the game 100000% its the best game ever made"" because frankly everyone has their own taste and you might not like the game but i'd say at least give it a shot for a while and if you turn out enjoying it more just stick to LoR because in the current HS trajectory HS seems like it'll only get more and more expensive."

TryndamereMains,ff5qsci,t1_ff5q505,1579606510.0,"Yeah i get it but it fills the same function as attack damage(except skill scaling),makes you hit harder by a consistent amount. On 100% crit there would be no difference since 100% chance to do 200% damage is the same thing as doing 100% bonus damage every autoattack but anything in between it'd be like buying ad and not crit chance. Idk i like crit the way it is. But to answer  your question; trynd would be weaker since he relies on early damage potential of crits to get lane dominance. Your lane would be significantly worse, to the point i dont think he'd be playable. A passive that says your autos do 35% more dmg is terrible when your kit relies on your autos to do damage."

TryndamereMains,fencwqb,t3_epkzli,1579281996.0,"Im a pretty old tryndamere player myself, ive been playing him since early season 3 and got on to playing him after watching hao videos and streams. The reason why no cdr trynd worked back then is because of few reasons:

1) You had no good ways of building cdr on tryndamere. Tri force built off zeal so you had no cdr,and essence reaver didn't exist back then. You could get cdr from like buying brutalizer or getting cdr quints but brutalizer didn't build into anything tryndamere wanted and cdr quints were fucking trolling on tryndamere. No way you'd sacrifice 10%ish attack speed for cdr. 

2) Games cdr was lower in general and mobility wasnt nearly as common. People you'd be punching were shit like veigar anivia orianna etc. with less cdr themselves so you didn't have trouble catching up to people unlike now where if you don't buy cdr everyone will dash around you while you're trying to run at them like an idiot

3) Ghost was way stronger than it currently is since it gave all the movespeed immediately instead of slowly ramping up so you could just ghost and dive peoples asses with no problem. Even riven couldn't get away from you.

Here are all the reasons trynd builds cdr now aqnd why its dumb not to build cdr:

1) You quite literally don't sacrifice anything for it. You get your crit chance just the same,you get your ad just the same, your attack speed is a bit lower than what it used to be than in season 3 but lethal tempo does a good job bridging that gap in 1v1s so you don't feel the difference that much. If you still do tho, get a bork or a guinsoo and you're set. 

2) Mobility powercreep means not getting cdr asks for getting permanently kited by every champion in existence.

My point is, don't be a boomer trying to live the glory days and buy cdr its good. You'll lose some turret pushing speed by not getting more attack speed sure but you're still one of the fastest splitpushers in the game, only outdone by yorick trundle and nasus who are all splitpush bots. And everything else is just better. You have more catch up, you have better dueling, you do more damage with cdr since you proc sheen more with your e's, its just good."
TryndamereMains,fenbjej,t3_epz8rt,1579281156.0,"Trynds early game is incredible maybe you need some more practice on it. If anything i'd say tryndamere as a champion is more similar to lane bullies like renekton than scalers like nasus. Go flash ignite, have lethal tempo as your primary, start e, build up fury and spin into people to crit them down. Early crits are way stronger than most champion abilities and since you have the attack speed on tempo you can get them again and again for early game kill pressure. After establishing your health/kill lead you start starving the opponent from cs by either freezing or slow pushing and go from there. But yeah all of this comes with practice. Watch some high elo tryndameres and see how they play and try to replicate the early game yourself."
TryndamereMains,fenb2wl,t1_femspre,1579280872.0,"Morde is a free matchup for trynd. He can't match your early game and he has no escapes. If you let him farm for a while and go even with you you'll have a bad time sure, but there's no reason why you'd allow that anyway. There are better champs to ban out there than mordekaiser. My bans personally are if i'm blind picking i ban malphite, and if i'm 4-5th pick i ban some good ganker or a bot laner who is good in the early game, since your bot not inting its lane is far more important than you doing well and honestly trynd isn't terrible into anything really outside of fringe picks like TK who you shouldn't ban anyway."
leagueoflegends,fenahsg,t1_femzlbu,1579280503.0,I want to strangle whoever came up with the phrase stat check. Its the most overused bullshit phrase in video game history. Every champion is appareantly no skill brain dead stat check who can be played by just rolling your face on the keyboard.
CompetitiveHS,fen2of5,t1_fen06bt,1579275631.0,"Yeah thats my suspicion too but maybe a 2-3 pirate that comes with huffer might offset the early mulligan loss. It remains to be seen though, i just feel like this might be okay because sky raiders can give you more of this guy and he's a really strong pirate overall. And i mean quest payoff for pirate warrior isn't bad at all either 4-3's every turn is way better than armor up for an aggressive deck. It'll enable you to last longer against more controlly lists."
CompetitiveHS,fen227e,t1_femvy6g,1579275234.0,"I mean sure but thats not really the issue with the no quest version. The problem with it is that this deck doesn't offer anything other than win% against control lists which largely don't exist in the metagame at the expense of your aggro win% getting lower. Doesn't mean you can't win with this variant, i mean as long as you can get the resurrects off in a timely manner you should be alright but you will struggle in games where the quest version would've been fine in. Elysiana is usually dead, galakrond value doesn't kick in until later into the game either and kronx is admittedly a really good card but i don't think running it warrants cutting great cards like the quest and vargoth. Like idk, if i face this as a tempo deck i'll be happier than facing the generic resurrect priest with quest. I think if galakrond priest is to succeed it needs to do so w/o the mass resurrect shenanigans because with them it just looks like a worse ress priest who has some extra win percentages against stuff like highlander control warrior and highlander mage and nobody plays those."

leagueoflegends,fem7vg4,t1_feldocd,1579242928.0,"> but isnt that the point of high skill ceiling? 

Kind of, but not to the extent you're talking about here. Champions shouldn't be better or worse depending on their skill ceiling. Champions should be better or worse depending on the situational skill shown by the player. Good example is lee sin, if you're capable of getting great kicks off in the late game his general late game weakness goes away and you're rewarded with relevance in that spot where you're supposed to be dumpster tier. That isn't something a renekton is capable of performing because he doesn't have a strong utility spell like that. Akali or champioms similar to her though, because they're high skill ceiling gets the right to be better than everyone which is wrong. Game isn't fun when a players character is obviously way better than everyone elses in that lobby and just because its high skill ceiling it shouldn't be allowed. Im okay with these nerfs honestly they're giving her thebzoe treatment. Nuke her off the orbit and then incrementally buff. As it is she's too strong and incremental nerfs didn't brought her down to where other champions are."

CompetitiveHS,feko6w8,t1_fekl0eq,1579204139.0,"Other than what can be generically said for this guy, being an auto include in every quest deck ever other than priest, an interesting discussion to raise is whether this guy enables a hack the system pirate warrior or not. This being a pirate is really good for a deck of that type and aggro decks like having overstatted minions who can also attack immediately. You also have the 2-3's to draw cards for you too so its hard to run out of steam with it. And hoard pillagers are good at making sure you can finish the quest consistently. And finally you have the highroll potential of getting more of these guys off the new 1-2 warrior pirate which is nuts. Obv drawback is that you have one less mulligan and one less card in your starting hand which can be a big deal. But at least you don't have to play hack the system on turn 1 unlike other aggro quests that didn't work out in the past,like marsh queen and murloc shaman quest.

He was a pivotal card to enable combo priest as it drew you like 5 cards on average. Same with mass res, it is an archetype enabler on its own since when you play mass res the minions you run with that deck are all things that heavily synergise with it.

All in all priest is an average class with a lot of variety in how you can play it ( there are no invoke galakrond builds, there are otk builds with leeroy, the albatross stuff is also there, you have last xpansions combo priest and the most prominent build of resurrect priest) which is more than what some classes can say, like paladin or druid who only have one viable deck to play at the moment."

Playing from behind is hard for every class but priest, who has access to a quest that punishes their opponent for using their tempo lead and pressuring their health total. Tempo deck is forced to sit back and build a board for 5 turns and wait for priests board clears or them developping a board.

Priest is fine,it always was fine and it'll remain fine. Certain priest packages like galakrond suck sure but i mean, we had freeze shaman before, that didn't mean shaman as a whole was bad and blizzard was biased against it or whatever. Uldum combo priest was good and was tier 1 prior to evolve coming to standard for some reason, dod res priest is solid t2,and we don't know where they'll end up being after the new adventure cards but i'm still betting on priest being a solid high t2 to low t1 deck."

Like idk what to say if you play tank tops and are having good success you clearly know something that i don't but if you don't play them i'd suggest playing maokai or sion for 15 games straight. I like playing tanks but my experience with them recently is every time i win my team was already doing well or was even and i became a win more factor and when my team was behind best i could do is help win one or two teamfights in the midgame and fall off as the enemy damage dealers scaled into the late game and mine didn't. The problem with tank top laners is that you can't effect your win condition of fed carries that can follow up on your initiation outside of your 5 minute cd summoner. I don't have any issues with jungle tanks or support tanks or even mid tanks, just top lane is too isolated at the moment to play a tank in it(in soloq)"

They're good, if i had 4 teammates i know are good in clash i'd pick a tank over bruisers every time but thats not how ranked is. Its far more reliable to give yourself the highest %chance to carry because you're the only constant variable in the game. So i'd say unless you know a specific tank counters the specific opposing laner you're playing against(think malphite into tryndamere) playing tanks is going to be worse than playing a damage dealer even if theyre better on paper due to the reasons you listed."

What is being ""kind to animals"" ? If you're looking at it from the standpoint of a vegan person you can make the case that killing of any animal is cruelty, but then singling out islam or qurban is weird because literally any other abrahamic religion allows you to use animals as food sources. 

> Except black dogs of course. Islam believes black dogs are evil.

Nothing in islamic scripture states that black dogs are evil, there might be hadiths that im not aware of, but thats not islamic scripture its basically a prominent muslim declaring black dogs being evil which doesn't mean the religion considers black dogs as evil creatures. Also i've yet to see a single human being, after living in a muslim country the last 23 ish years, who called a black dog an evil animal. And i've heard some weird shit like chess or wearing jeans being haram. So its probably something that noone really takes into serious consideration.

And those are your, facts ? None of what you said is factual its just confrontational crap that just seeks to start up a fight on comments. They're subjective at best, incorrect information at worst."

Which is not different than just slaughtering an animal for food in any other reason whatsoever, you just do it for a religious cause instead.

We're not talking about communism we're talking about islam. Islam is a religion its not an ideology.

I can also find arcane weird texts in any religion, that doesn't mean for example, christians of today are okay with slavery.

And finally cesar milan is a hack so nothing that he has to say in his dumb website has any weight to it. Dogs dp live in packs, that doesn't mean they have ""alpha"" dogs leading them. Alpha behavior in other animals don't match what the dogs do in their owm packs. For example an alpha male monkey will protect a pack of females and young ones, and they'll be the only male in the pack who has the right to mate. Occasionally they'll be challenged by other candidate males looking to be the alpha of the pack and if the candidate wins the challenge they become the alpha and they'll be the big monkey who is in charge of mating and protecting. No dog breed has such behavior. Some stray can't randomly come in and become the next alpha, and dogs don't have the whole exclusive mating rights thing either.  Dog packs are more cooperative and they don't have their pack leaders. My city has plenty of stray dog packs and i've yet to see a single one of them have an alpha dog in them."

You're way too pessimistic when it gets to slow cards and this quote easily shows this. You're saying that if the hero power casted flame strike every turn it'd be still bad, when it would easily be the best hero power in the history of hearthstone, so much so i'd argue playing reno on 10 would win you every game as mage. This hero power is fine/pretty good. It'll give you dozens of mana worth of value in an elongated game. The challenge is playing this and not dying immediately if you're low on health total.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone

I was playing the traditional version of highlander before but i really hated the fact that i had to run terrible cards (in terms of tempo) in the deck such as give a minion +1 attack or 3 mana deal 3. So i decided i would cut all of them, and i put in a dragon package instead. Imo there are some drawbacks and some upsides to this list, namely our late game is worse since we are lacking the lackey generation of galakrond variant, and we are lacking late game power plays such as kronx's devastations, togwaggle and galakrond himself but instead we gain a lot more early to mid game tempo since instead of running slow cards like praise galakrond we run things like faerie dragon that tempo rogue already used to play in the past. And generally the dragons in the deck arent conceptually foreign to rogue at all like i said faerie dragon was a staple in tempo rogue and feywing is just a bigger faerie dragon so it is still good. Also big ol' whelp is directly  comparable to azure drake which rogues also ran till it got hof'd. And when you frizz them they become even better tempo plays, also while we have less resource generation we have solid draw in candle breath which is a 3 mana draw 3. Waxadred is a bit foreign to rogue but i think of him as a no effect 5 mana 7-5 dragon and that is already good enough for me. It has better than premium stats and they are well distributed. If you have any questions or any card inclusions you'd like to propose i'd like to hear them."
