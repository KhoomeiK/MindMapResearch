AskReddit,fem9hti,t3_epkaux,1579244758.0,"Worked in a slightly more high end optical store and our â€œwhaleâ€ was this guy who was a dignitary at an embassy. He would come in every so often and ask for the most expensive frames and lens we have available, and he would always ask us to bill it under a different name every time. 

He once had his 13 year old daughter come in for a pair and she choose this $100 pair of Guess frame which he promptly switched to a gold framed Chanel ones that were in the $500-$800 range, lens not included yet. And you guessed it, different name, most likely a subordinate who doesnâ€™t need glasses but healthcare covers it or something, no idea. 

My boss started â€œhidingâ€ me by not having me work on days he likes to come in after he offered me a job as a translator/assistant. I know English and a little Mandarin, thatâ€™s it. While my boss did things that were questionable, he took care of me and Iâ€™m grateful for that."
