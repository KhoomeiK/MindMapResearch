It's worth pointing out that Reinforce only boosts your capture power in **friendly controlled areas**, meaning you can only use it for defense after you've captured the point. You can't use it to attack enemy-held points, or for the initial capture of the center strongpoint in Warfare mode. This is also why it's not available to attackers in Offensive mode.

Encouraged only affects the **sectors** resource output, it does not affect node output, so it's not very useful right now.

A good technique is to use Last Stand first, then Reinforce and Encouraged (and supply, strafe, bombing run if you want, for free). If you have 60 manpower you can use all three manpower abilities and it will only cost you the initial 30 to use Last Stand. You still have to have 30 manpower left over to use the other manpower abilities though, so you need at least 60 to begin with."

Everybody is susceptible to misinformation and all of the biases/fallacies that were listed in this segment.

People believe that if you're an organ donor the paramedics won't try as hard to save your life if you're injured. People believe that swimming within 30 minutes of eating a meal will give you a cramp in the water.

Anti-vaxxers are a segment of society that has fallen into the trap that we are all vulnerable to and have even fallen into ourselves. The difference is that their beliefs can have a detrimental effect on children.

So, unlike astrology and aquatic superstitions, we need to fix this problem. We aren't going to do it by deriding these people and ""exposing"" them with undercover news segments. That's just going to drive them away and confirm their suspicions that everybody is out to get them.

For instance, Andrew Williams was paid $2,335 for his house and three lots, and even though he had originally asked for $3,500, the final compensation still represented a significant increase over the $125 that he had paid for the property in 1825.
