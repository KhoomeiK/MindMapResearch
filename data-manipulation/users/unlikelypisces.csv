AskReddit,fgqawem,t1_fgpuqle,1581020985.0,"I went to the ""Super Bloom"" in SoCal last year.  Thought it would be fun to take the wife and kids out on a nice nature walk and enjoy the bloom, and maybe snap 3 or 4 pics in the moment.  Got there, and there were herds of teen and 20-something girls, plastered with makeup, hair did, wearing carefully chosen outfits all taking pictures of each other in numerous poses.  They were everywhere.  None really enjoying the scenery, purely focused on getting the best pic. Like seriously, what do likes on IG do for you anyways??"

I am just familiar with the past 30 yeas and can say that income inequality has increased dramatically. But if you are comparing 1930's to today, at least based on 2 min of google research, it is similar to today's levels."
news,ffthr5b,t1_fft4fx8,1580220873.0,"It reminds me of an article I read recently where one of Google's attorneys was saying it's a fiduciary responsibility to infringe on patents, because they can make so much by infringing and the fines if they end up losing a patent infringement lawsuit are negligible and often many years later."

todayilearned,ff3grx2,t1_ff3286p,1579540710.0,"My wife, who is petite and skinny, and looks young for her age is also legally disabled. She shattered her knee cap when she lived in a small village with inadequate medical care as a kid and it never healed correctly. Four or five surgeries later, which occured during her teen and young adult years, she still suffers from severe chronic pain and arthritis. Her knee gets visibly swollen if she walks too much. She has a handicap placard. I love telling people off who question her placard or give her dirty looks about it. One of my favorites is when we were trying to enter a state park for a discount using the placard, and the ranger asked ""What's wrong with her?"". And I politely said, ""Sir, that her private medical information."" And he profusely apologized and let us through."

Ask for a side of ""pickle"" to go with. Usually is diced veggies marinated in a spicy, salty, vinegary sauce."
