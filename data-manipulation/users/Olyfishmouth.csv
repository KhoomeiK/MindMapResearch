fatlogic,ffdt09y,t1_ffc4jbo,1579828179.0,That's essentially a bottle of wine. Which if it's a strong red or a sweet wine can have nearly as many calories as a pint of ice cream.
fatlogic,ffdnnii,t3_eszxrf,1579824733.0,I might not feel guilty but I would feel regret because that much fat and chocolate together would give me mean reflux.
xxfitness,ffd1zoj,t3_ese4qn,1579811837.0,"Over the past four years I have gone from 204-260-198-233-189. I had two pregnancies, first one with twins and second with one baby. I am 6'0 with a large frame so 189 looks fairly athletic on me. 

I don't count calories unless I am starving at night to figure out if maybe I accidentally under-ate. I work out 5-6 days a week with weights or spinning and have some physical hobbies. If my weight loss stalls or I gain a few, I cut out alcohol and cut back on sweets, and try to change out starchy foods for green foods. I used to calorie track so I have a decent mental ballpark of the nutrition of various things. I am lucky in that my caloric needs are high due to my height and muscle bulk. 

I eat the most at breakfast and lunch, less at dinner because I have reflux and a big night-time meal upsets my stomach. I don't eat a lot of animal fat for the same reason. I am also lactose intolerant so dairy is very limited."
fatlogic,ff9amtx,t1_ff8a1mj,1579708634.0,Absolutely not. I am not a butthole doctor.
fatlogic,ff89u7a,t1_ff7h0t8,1579670292.0,A lot of type 2 diabetics get used to the feeling of having sugars over 150 and that is the only thing that feels normal to them. Which is why they make blood glucose monitors instead of having people dose insulin when they feel like it.
fatlogic,ff89fki,t1_ff7rokk,1579669912.0,"I live in a small city and am a doctor. I see patients at my gym ALL the time (and co-workers, and my kid's dentist, and physical therapists I refer to). I want to make small talk with them as little as they probably do with me. A smile and a nod is the only thing I'll do."
fatlogic,ff87s55,t1_ff7pu8u,1579668446.0,My sister has a small third nipple (looks like a mole) and it did make a little milk when she was breastfeeding.
CozyPlaces,ff7fwh7,t3_es2d2m,1579648618.0,The entire state of Texas is a sauna for 6 months out of the year.
