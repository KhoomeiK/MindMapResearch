I can already see some part of a future for you. You'll have to hold out and see how things go for you. In the meanwhile, relax and let things play out.

Breakups are generally more critical a.k.a hard to deal with the closer they are to the day it happened. As time unfolds, you'll gradually feel better and move on and that woe you have will subside.."
OnePiece,fc9na8j,t3_egsz5b,1577555254.0,If Joyboy is the source of the straw hat. Then I guess that sarcophagus with the straw hat resting upon it is where some trace of Joyboy is stored - i.e his body.
