Not who you replied to, and also not taking sides in the exchange everyone above us is having.

But, there are videos taken inside of hospitals that show a lot of deaths. A few days ago one video emerged and, given the stats at the time, would've shown 4%-6% of supposed deaths all in a 2 minute clip.
