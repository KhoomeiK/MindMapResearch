Search for actual vulnerabilities in the java version they are using. Just because software isn't the latest version doesn't automatically mean it's vulnerable.

I wouldn't exclude anything. Senior management are the only ones who should be doing that through formal risk acceptance.

Something seemed to change in the 90s (I was a teen so I can't say I know what it was) all I remember was ""women want a sensitive man"" and things started turning to ""I'm owed something because they're rich and I'm not"".
