worldbuilding,ffbyzny,t3_essk5p,1579787202.0,"Depends on the motivations for settlement. My personal favourite is building up a riverine island and developing a population centre from there.

**Paris** began on an Island in the middle of the Seine, heavily walled and purely defensive in placement. It was the seat of royalty and a mercantile hub, drawing resources from the surrounding countryside.

**Tenochtitlan** was constructed in a naturally fertile floodplain, turning the swamps of lake Texcoco into farmland and maintaining their urban centre on natural and manmade islands. 

In the Corsair's Valley, **Atongwa** began as a series of islands, connected by stone bridges, the urban sprawl and aquatic farmland eventually expanding to connect them. Its towers and walls cast long shadows on the canal suburbs at lake-level. An island city is an incredibly defensable position, not to mention the agricultural potentials.

In my old world **Maarda**, the city of Maarken is a towering sprawl of red brick and tile, procedurally developing from cities on the islands coasts, building inward to the vast palace at the center."

worldbuilding,few2ovu,t3_eqlzh4,1579404632.0,"You have two towns in the **Kana Unity** that are not yet connected by roads? One of these is likely very new, most likely an agricultural community formed in an undeveloped river valley. 

You want to make a road, so you don't need to appeal to the emperor, simply the lords of the connecting town and to the local mining authority to outsource the materials, if you cannot mine your own.

You should use stone or brick, as it will be the cheapest for you and there is no standard. 

You have a town filled with able bodied workers, so declare this project as your community's current industry and your people will be supplied with comparable funding.

The arcology or town you are building to will likely accept this with open arms, depending on the ruling clan."
