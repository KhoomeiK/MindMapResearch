Most of the book is about training herding dogs to herd but chapter 7 is entitled ""Working Personality Types in Herding Dogs"" and explains seven common personality types with their characteristics/behavior basics/and how best to approach training for each personality type"
dogs,ffgcc9s,t1_ff1e7ia,1579903097.0,this thread is hilarious
reactivedogs,ffg2l3o,t1_fffy4d6,1579897097.0,"I'm not here to be a contrarian. but generally, most stranger and dog selectivness won't start to show until a dog matures (1 to 2 years depending upons size -- browsing any of the dog/dog training sites/forums will show that it's at this maturation/settling into adult personality that many owners start to have problems because their once sweet puppy has become an adult). 

most puppies of any and all breeds will be stranger-friendly and dog-friendly certainly within the first year and up to the second fear stage (8 to 14) months unless they have a lot of negative experiences (ie a bad attack that leads to blood). so it's unsurprising that as of now littermates are doing fine and that your puppy has been fine outside the home. but those things still don't indicate it's not a genetic/breed thing.

I think this resource, especially that underneath the subheading ""The Pack at Home"" might be of interest to you as your puppy sounds like she's exhibiting a similar thing but to an extreme (such as may happen with genetics gone wrong)

reactivedogs,fffuvw0,t1_fffu2pm,1579892313.0,"... >Breeding ignores science entirely. If breeding actually used science

but okay. for the record, you're the one who singled out the pit in my comments when it's more likely it's the akita background that's causing issues. akitas are not easy dogs and are prone to human aggression which pits are not. no one would recommend an akita to a first-time owner for this reason, particularly an akita from unknown parentage.

reactivedogs,fffshn2,t1_fffr2zo,1579890829.0,"I'm confused by your statement. I'm not saying breeding uses science for 'better' dogs, it uses science for dogs that subscribe to what a group of people believes is their version of a better dog. 

you have brachycephalic dogs because people wanted the look of brachycephalic dogs. people liked the snub nose so they bred for hte snub nose.

have you heard of the russian fox experiment in which scientists specifically choose foxes based on their relative friendliness and gradually over generations created a tame and friendly 'breed' of foxes?

and yes, pit bulls are more dog aggressive because they were bred for gaminess plus tenacity in order to create a dog that would excel at dog fights. it is incredibly irresponsible to say that pit bulls are not more prone to dog aggression than other breeds.
from a pit-bull friendly website:
>Dog aggression is a common issue in pit bulls. In fact, the UKC's official breed standard for the American Pit Bull Terrier states that ""most APBTs exhibit some level of dog aggression."" But while dog aggression may be normal in pit bulls, that doesn't mean it can't become a problem.

reactivedogs,fffmg9s,t1_fffh091,1579887121.0,"Putting together a breed hard-wired with dog aggression (pit) with a breed hard-wired with protectiveness (Akita) with a breed hard-wired with stubbornness (husky) is likely to have uglier issues than any one dog of a full breed. The whole reason there are breeds is because tens of thousands of people specifically isolated certain traits (behavioral and physical) in order to replicate them. To ignore breed predispositions is to ignore science. While there always may be outliers, especially with mutts, breed profiles are a strong indicator of expected behavior and can significantly help an owner determine how to deal with certain behavior problems (ie training a herding dog vs training a terrier). so when we say it's genetic, it's that these hard-wired traits somehow got fucked up to their extremes. bad breeding practices (such as that which would cause such a mutt mix) can be blamed.

ETA: from a personal anecdote, I never truly understood some of my shepherd mix's quirks until I read a herding dog-specific book that separated common herding dog personalities and had a whole section on the ""low self-esteem dog"". I had never even thought that dogs could have 'low self-esteem' but reading that chapter and seeing how it played into his breed profile revolutionized how I approached and trained my dog with great effects."
reactivedogs,fffe59c,t1_fff08lf,1579881977.0,"Her history says Akita, pit, husky mix with some others. I personally think it is a genetic/neurological issue as no puppy should act like that. 

op, I read your other puppy101 post and I'm sorry about all those saying you're doing wrong. You've done all you could, possibly spending thousands or more. This isn't your fault. Normal puppies don't act like that. Even puppies who were abused wouldn't act like this. Listen to your vets and behaviorists, and I hope when your heart is ready you'll find the right puppy who will love you back because having a dog that is fully yours and fully loyal is an incredible relationship."

dogs,fcryu7q,t1_fcrpm7e,1577908574.0,"FWIW I appreciate this type of advice. The first time I had a puppy stung by a wasp, I freaked out and rushed to the vet and paid a couple of hundred dollars to be given basically Benadryl. The next time it happened, I did it on my own and he got better in the same amount of time and my pocketbook was a whole lot happier. Would have liked a more commonsense answer such as yours the first time around instead of having to pay for the experience.

and re: OP, my dog had a similar sprain jumping from the sitter's SUV when they were watching him. I gave him just a bit of aspirin, put him on bedrest and stayed home for the weekend to watch. He was back up and about by Monday. If he hadn't I would've gone to the vet -- but in my situation, waiting seemed the smarter, more cost effective option. but ymmv."
AskTruFemcels,fckq8fz,t1_fckb3gx,1577730837.0,"lol I just finished 'the stand' and was searching reddit for wtf was there to like about franny and came across your now locked thread.

I just wanna say, I'm 100% with you on nick the asshole and, in addition to his raping and deserting a 16/17year old, he also is heroic for leaving two men to die in cells..

I hated nick. I hated franny for writing all that shit about harold and treating him like shit and never ever apologizing and still going back to shit on him -- even after she realizes how much harold helped them get to the west. I hated stu for being the most boring ass vanilla character I've ever seen be a protagonist. and I hate that the most interesting character, the guy who could have had the most satisfying of redemeption character arcs, end in sucide.

I can't believe I wasted 48 hours listening to a book in which the least deserving people get the happiest ending. altho, as you write, neither of those two are going to survive.

assassinscreed,fcg8eo3,t1_fcg55r3,1577637572.0,"yea, it confuses me too. and while I say I loved zero horizon dawn, I felt like the story went way too fast, I started it and then suddenly I was done, and the map felt too constrained and small. I had only skyrim then to compare it to and so thought maybe most all game maps were like zhd and skyrim was just unique in its scale.

and then came odyssey and BAM so much space, exploration, and quest choices. 

sad to hear that this find and seek formula isn't common, I hope ubisoft keeps it for the next ac release"
dogs,fc7e66k,t3_eglcs2,1577504765.0,">why would they want to purposely kill dogs?

stop. this isn't about purposely killing dogs, no vet would last long if they were purposely killing dogs. this is about how all things come with their risks, including vaccines.

when my dog was under 6 months old, I took him for one round of vaccines and he didn't react well to one of them. for about a week following the vaccine he was lethargic, had snot coming out, etc. I put him on bed rest and he got better fairly quickly. vaccines help protect animals from the worst of certain diseases, but they do so by containing germs of those diseases. have you ever gotten a flu shot and felt a little sick afterwards? that's why. your doctor wasn't out to get you sick just like my vet wasn't out to get my dog sick, it just sometimes happens when your immune system isn't fully ready to take on the vaccine.

your parent's puppy had a horrible reaction, it sucks, but it happens. taking any vaccine is a risk albeit a very, very, very small one and *almost always worth it for the long-term protections.

note, that said, there is a subsector of vets that believe we are over-vaccinating pets and your parents may be getting some of their information from that crowd. imo, that subsector is not wholly wrong or misguided, but there's a big difference between over-vaccination and no vaccinations at all. if this puppy was on the right vaccination schedule, then she was just one of the tiny minority have a fatally adverse reaction to it. 

your parents are also grieving. let them grieve. this is not a time to lecture them even if you know they are in the wrong."
