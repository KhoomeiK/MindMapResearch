This is definitely useful. I went from a medtronic to Tslim and I was so used to medtronic letting me at least get home to change my reservoir after dismissing the alarm. The Tslim is less forgiving and will yell at you until you change it, no matter how many times you dismiss the alarm."

Dexcom: the inserters are bulky but easy to do one handed. You can try different areas of your body. The FDA has only approved it for stomach. A lot of people use their upper buttocks area, arm, or even thigh. With your arm make sure you pick a fattier area to insert it. If it hits muscle it'll hurt and you'll have to dispose of it. Make sure you don't put it somewhere that you naturally bend. Get over tape for it. Dexcom will send you transparent tape type patches for free. I buy simpatch on Amazon they're better at keeping the site stuck even through sweating and showering. I also use skin tac underneath the patches and my sensor lasts well beyond 10 days. If one bleeds when you insert it that's fine. You can keep it in if the bleeding stops. If it continues to bleed you'll need to remove it. If you have to remove a sensor before the 10 days is up for any reason call dexcom and they'll send you a replacement.
