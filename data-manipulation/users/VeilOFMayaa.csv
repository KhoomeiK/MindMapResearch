They told me after 3 months id be hired on with the company and get a significant raise.

It was an oilfield type shop so sandblasting/lifting very heavy pipe all day long. I was making 15 an hour which is minimum wage and offered 16 to go on with the company itself. I told them what the recruiter told me and she just lied to me to get them to pay the agency for my labour. I told the recruiter to kiss my ass and apologised to the company and quit that day."
