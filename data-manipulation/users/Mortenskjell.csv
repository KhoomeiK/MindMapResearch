There is absolutely no shame at all to reach out for help. I have friends who have done it. It made me look a little differently at them, it made me think they are braver and more mature than i ever knew they were."

Ending your life is not the answer, even though it sounds tempting

I work at a psycosis hospital and i see some shit.
I have also been in some dark places. Inside my own head to be exact.
Every fucked up thought you've had, i've had. 
Although a part of me will always be broken, i managed to ""get out"" of it and i am stronger than ever.

As i write this comment i am sitting outside the room of a patent. Her door is open so i can see her. I sit here, to make sure she doesn't kill herself in some way. Even though i dont really know her, it would hurt a ton if she died, because of the thought that i could have prevented it.

I also lost a friend to suicide a year and a half ago. I grieved alone because i was not friends with his other friend circle.

You may not think of this right now, but the pain you would leave behind for the people who know you, is tremendous.

I am not going to tell you that i know how you feel, i probably don't. But i am going to tell you that i believe in you, and that i hope you dont end your story here.

Stay strong"

Last thursday she invited me on a trip in the mountains/Woods to sleep in hammocks. And that friday we did. However she is a very genuine person and she is kind to most people.
But as a girl, would you invite someone you met only about a month or two ago, to do something like that if you didn't have a thing for him?

5- I know for sure that i am joining the military.
But i am a strong individual in a lot of ways and i like to push myself hard. To give it all, and even a little more. Being a marine is a mong others one of the branches that would offer an opportunity to test my gut, and possiblr even help others.

Advice,fc5l2ew,t3_eg8w4a,1577460463.0,"My advice?
Allow yourself to feel, and take your time. Dont compare yourself to others, as we all go through stuff differently. And if you feel like it, talk about it. Its healthy to get stuff off your chest. 

But dont get so caught up in it that you dont move on. You dont have to do that yet, but sooner or later you gotta move on. This is the price to pay for loving someone, and although it hurts it is worth it.

And when you get the strength to move forward, dont ever forget her. Dont look back and dwell to much, but remember where you came from!

This is how i deal with stuff.  There is no right way to do it, but i am confident that you will find out a way that is right for you.
