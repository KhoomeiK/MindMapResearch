AskReddit,ffuv8li,t1_ffunkru,1580249980.0,"Well, it was actually two things so I'll keep it short. The first one was my views on homosexuality. I grew up believing in the standard ""God hates the gays"" passages like Romans 1 and Sodom and Gamorrah due to a good few technicalities in language. I recently started actually looking into it since my new girlfriend is bi. and realized that almost every one of the verses I held dear were actually talking about rape and forced religious prostitution.  The other one was my views on sex as a whole. I again was told that literally any sexual activity was a sin and even thinking about it was sinful. Turns out, I had been so judgemental of other people for just *wanting to have the vaguest notion of sex* and got even more offended when they were gay.

I keep hearing this and I feel like you might not understand what it means. While the government can choose to censor people (i.e. not allowing people to gather in a public place and speak about religion or something) a private community electing not to have people discussing unrelated (or unwanted) topics is NOT censorship. 

For example, if you're on a vacuum cleaner forum and you go into the main page and begin posting unrelated material about Free Hong Kong, regardless of how noble your intentions were, you are only getting in the way between people and their vacuums. You should expect to have your post removed because it's just unwelcome, not because the vague notion of private censorship.

By the same metric, carrying a flag that says ""I hate anyone who isn't Korean"" into Times Square is actually completely legal (albeit tasteless). If a private citizen begins harassing you over it even if you had done nothing more than *exist*, than that hostile person is in the wrong even if what you were saying was the textbook definition of hatespeech. At the end of the day, hatespeech is protected speech in the USA but the government allows other groups to self-regulate what they're saying. 

Tl;Dr A private group saying that you can't talk about something = not censorship

The literal government saying that you can't talk about something in a public place = censorship

What you were talking about earlier isn't censorship.

EDIT: I'm talking about US government here."
