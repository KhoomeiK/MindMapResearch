Don't want to comment about your stepmom as I don't have anything positive to say. Look after yourself, move out if you must and keep an eye on your dad. Sounds like he will need your support emotionally/mentally. Hugs"

If you have no commitments or responsibilities, list the things that make you happy. If practical to pursue them to make a living, do it. Differentiate between hobbies and things that can sustain your lifestyle. Best of luck."

\-figure out what motivates you (some passion, money, etc) and start in that direction even at entry level positions. Slog it out

\-move to a different city/state where there are abundant jobs, earn some money and while you're doing that , try to figure out your next steps.

Good luck"

I've lost a few along the way due to this phenomenon of people being 'busy', 'forgetful', 'unenthusiastic'. You'll put in the needed effort if it is worth it. Be loving, but don't lose your self-worth."
