I've fucked up over the holidays and gained back 5lbs! When I stepped on the scale, i was very discouraged and disappointed in myself. I'm now back at square one and eating 1000 - 1200 daily and doing cardio for 40 mins and fit in some strength training. I know I can easily lose the weight, but I feel bad because I got carried away."
