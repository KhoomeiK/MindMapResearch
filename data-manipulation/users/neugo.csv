EDIT:  I should rephrase that, as I know how much Redditors like to ignore your argument to focus on any meaningless error you made...  If property values go up massively, overnight, that means that people were willing to offer a lot more for the property (than they were before) - and that these offers were accepted (property values and tax-assessments are based on an area's sales-history).  That is demand rising massively.  The whole demand curve shifting to the right, because of the stadium.  So, demand (for that property/location) is now higher.  Not lower.  What land has ever risen so much in value that no one would buy it?  Has it ever happened once in all of human history?  Also, the stadium takes land for residential apartments away, so supply contracts (if they bulldozed residential buildings to build the stadium) or stays the same (if they built on bare land that was off-the-market).  Either way, you have higher demand for your property - or, you have higher demand in a market that's low on supply.  Either option is WAY better for you (financially) than what you had before."

I ran the numbers and, if you could magically take 10% of the world's military spending, that would only leave you with less than 50 cents per hungry/impoverished person, per day - to end both hunger and poverty.  Oh, and that's for people who are both hungry and impoverished.  If a person is just hungry, you only have 25c per day.  And vice versa.

todayilearned,ff54l43,t3_ermtk2,1579580065.0,"This is not really true.  10% of $1.7 trillion is $170 billion per year.  WorldHunger.org says that there are 815 million 'chronically undernourished' people on Earth.

So...  You have to provide food for ***a minimum*** of 815 million people (likely a lot more, seeing as there are hungry people who aren't chronically undernourished).  Let's be generous and say a billion.  But, that's not all.  You want to 'end poverty' as well.

The World Bank says there were 736 million people living in poverty in 2015.  The poverty level they use is $1.90 a day.  So, again, the real number is likely a lot higher than 736 million if you want to actually end poverty (you'd want to make sure everyone on Earth gets at least $5 or $10 a day, minimum).

So, to end poverty and hunger, you're going to have to feed a billion people - and hand another billion people a bunch of free money.  Minimum.

Can you do that on your budget of $170 billion a year?  No, you cannot.  Most of these people are in places where it's pretty hard to get them food and money.  And, if you can, warlords just steal it.

Handing a billion people (up to) $1.90 a day costs you (up to) $693.50 a year per person.  And this doesn't include distribution costs, which will be astronomical!

10% of the world's military spending means you have less than 50 cents per day to feed each these people (AND take them out of poverty)!

I imagine it's cheaper nowadays, but not by a lot..."
IAmA,fel4s87,t1_fek1u85,1579214052.0,"Rape is a he-said/she-said type of crime (which makes it extremely hard to prosecute because it often comes down to one person's word vs. another's).  So, you would expect it to have a much higher exceptional-clearance rate than most other types of crimes.

EDIT:  Love it when Reddit down-votes you, not because you are wrong, but because they *really* don't like that you are right...  Sigh."
television,fel2gep,t1_fekwje7,1579212614.0,"But...  Netflix and their customers would be a lot better off if they purchased half as many productions, but chose much higher-quality (instead of hoovering up all the worst/cheapest shit imaginable)."
television,fel25s6,t1_fekw07u,1579212429.0,"No shit!  But, Netflix is paying extra to buy the North American rights to movies and tv-shows made in 20+ different languages.  They aren't just buying Italian shows to play in Italy.  They are buying mediocre Italian/French/Danish/etc... productions to play in the US and Canada (because they can get them a lot cheaper than English language productions or high-quality foreign productions)."

Oooh boy, 186 more stand-up comedy acts!  3,200 more foreign tv-shows!  886 more documentaries!  5,786 more straight-to-video quality films!"
canada,fej6f6r,t1_fehx7x4,1579158800.0,"If it's only $1m a year - that's actually a tremendous value!  Think of the publicity value alone of having royals living in Canada!  There have been $100m campaigns promoting Canada around the world that didn't accomplish half of what having Royals move here would.  We've received probably a million or two worth of publicity so far, just from all the articles written around the world already.  Look at how much investment came to Canada after events like the Olympics, Expo 86, etc...  Billions of dollars.  And those were short events.  Having royals live here give value for the entire time.  Every article written about them will be about how they don't live in the UK."
