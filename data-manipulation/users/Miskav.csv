It's abundantly clear that the climate we live in now is different from 25+ years ago. Even the animals living here are different from our normal native fauna. 

Insects massively going extinct, instead being replaced by tropical insects. Birds no longer nesting where they used to. 

And this is north-western europe. 

We used to have more snow in a year than we've had in the last 2 decades."

Nowadays? You're lucky to have 1 day with snow, and that's just a tiny amount. 

The climate has changed so much in less than half a century, it's terrifying.
