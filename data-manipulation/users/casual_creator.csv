I will be happy to consider the idea that it did occur during FOTR (despite any direct evidence pointing to it), but it is discussed during the Helms Deep section of the Two Towers BTS, while actors are talking about injuries sustained during filming of Helms Deep/Two Towers. I will also point out that Fellowship also has a segment on injuries (ie Sam’s foot being stabbed, Merry getting a splinter), but there is no mention of Viggo’s tooth there.   

Edit: I was also able to find this first hand account:  

> In one take, Mortensen was battling an Uruk-Hai [note: there were no Uruk-Hai at Weathertop] a powerful and ferocious strain of orc, when a blade that was jutting from an extra's armour slashed into his face. ""I thought, Oh my God, he's lost his face,"" recalls Perez, who then saw that the blade had somehow missed Mortensen's flesh but split his tooth - literally in half. ""I said, 'You lost half a tooth.' And he looked at me and said, 'Look for it. You can stick it on with superglue.' And I said, 'No, come on, don't be silly, you can't.'"" Mortensen finally relented and went to a dentist's office, still in full battle armour.

Corridor,ffm87fc,t1_ffgsm8q,1580050172.0,"You’re making a SHIT TON of assumptions about people who were effectively background extras in the video.   

The only reason you know Wren feels this way is because he’s the star of the video, telling you why it means so much to him. You know literally nothing about the feelings of anyone else there. The experience could easily be just as important/meaningful (if not more so) to any of them."
Corridor,ffm6x2l,t1_ffkfecw,1580049583.0,"Eh. Is it really growth, though? We used to get multiple videos each week that starred the entire gang and whose content featured everything from goofing off, to games, to tutorials, to behind the scenes of other projects. We now get two videos a week, where one of them is *always* the same three people sitting on a couch, having jumped on the tired React-style video trend, and they don’t even spend enough time on any example to make it really worthwhile.      

That isn’t an evolution. It’s a degradation, imo. Don’t get me wrong: I *love* the Crew and even their “worst” video is still pretty great (I agree with the other users view on Wren’s kick flip video), but it’s a definite devolution of the channel. I can appreciate they’ve done this due to the LOE and better financial returns, but it’s still sad to see.     

The problem is that they’ve spread themselves too thin, and unfortunately, the Crew channel was put on the chopping block. It’s no longer the Corridor *Crew* channel; it’s “the same three people from Corridor React Channel.”   

To be clear, I’m not really complaining, more so just stating my view on the situation here. I’ve got zero ill will towards the guys. It’s their channel, their job and livelihood and we get to see all their hard work for free. I’m certainly not trying to raise a pitchfork over changes they decide to make. I’d rather have one good Crew video a week than several videos that leave anything to be desired."

I was in third or fourth grade and we were learning about Jamestown. John Smith, Pocahontas, and all that. Just so happens that the Disney’s Pocahontas had just been released. My teacher was LIVID at how much they got wrong. She hauled us all into the computer lab, explained what the internet and email was, and we sat and watched her write a scathing email to Disney about the film."
movies,fd78snr,t1_fd48uks,1578200925.0,"I thought the concept of the flick was really interesting, but the execution was terrible. They really should have pushed further with the body horror angle, imo. I could have forgiven the movie of its sins and ended it thinking it was somewhat decent, but that final scene absolutely killed all the good Will I tried to have for the movie."
movies,fd783cy,t1_fd6rpcs,1578200663.0,"> And an emperor would never fight a gladiator like that lmao   

Sort of...the real Commodus LOVED gladiatorial fights and very often *did* fight. But while his opponents would eventually submit and their lives would be spared, he was known to kill his opponents in practice matches. He would also drag out wounded soldiers and prisoners of war to the arena and personally kill them. So I find the movie having Commodus stab Maximus and then fight him in the arena to be accurate *in spirit*.   

My favorite little tidbit about Gladiator is how in real life, popular gladiators had what amounted to marketing deals, they’d advertise for local businesses using their popularity to boost sales, much like today’s athletes, but it wasn’t shown in the film because they worried people would think it was stupid and anachronistic."

movies,fd3xrnk,t1_fd2360o,1578162555.0,"There’s a documentary on Hulu about one of the Bond actors, Lazenby, that is really eye opening about what it takes to be Bond. Never mind the grueling shoots and press tours, but the studio makes a point to effectively *own* you the entire time you’re under contract (not just while filming or doing press), to the point of telling you where to eat, what to wear, how to look (no facial hair, etc), the actors entire lives’ are completely micromanaged for two-three years per film. It’s gotta be exhausting.  

Add onto that how hard Craig has to work to get each film made, I can 100% see why at the end of filming he just wants to be done with it for a while. Craig has likened it to asking a marathon runner if they want to run again right as they collapse at the finish line."

It was just a bit playing up on Ford’s feelings about Star Wars.

Lara Croft’s look was designed to titillate. She’s an archeologist...that for some reason runs around in booty shorts and a skin tight tank top to show off an exaggerated porn star body.   

Now I have ZERO issue with sexualized characters, but to try and claim that Lara’s design was that of an asexual nun until Edios started putting images of her in silk dresses in game magazines is totally disingenuous. There’s a reason every boy in the early 90s believed in a secret nude cheat."

ConanBeingAwesome,fcsakdp,t1_fcnlr65,1577913828.0,"Short version:  

The Tonight Show is a major late night talk show, having aired since the 50s. Jay Leno had been hosting since 92. Conan, host of another show on the same channel, NBC, was promised The Tonight Show when Jay retired. Once Conan finally starts hosting the Tonight Show, Jay regrets retiring and gets Conan fired, stealing the Tonight Show back, only to retire *again* just a few years later.  The show is now hosted by Jimmy Fallon, and Conan has his own little media empire on another channel.     

There’s a bit more to it than that, in regards to HOW Leno got Conan forced out, but that’s the basic gist of it. It was a pretty big deal when it happened, with pretty much the entire US entertainment industry seeing Leno as a villain (rightly so), which is why Leno’s return didn’t last very long."
