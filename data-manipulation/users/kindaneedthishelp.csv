depression,fbxjzf8,t1_fbxjx3d,1577191079.0,Something like that ðŸ˜‚.  Itâ€™s fucked tho itâ€™s all good itâ€™s going well then all of a sudden ur back at the start.  Do you think we all get hurt so much because we fall straight away for the first person to make us feel happy. Itâ€™s not something Iâ€™m used to feeling so I donâ€™t wanna lose it when I get it
