IAmA,ffi2oah,t3_etr9mc,1579963312.0,"My 19 year old son was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He's being seen by a psychiatrist and we have now begun the challenge of finding him the correct combination of medications. His psychiatrist has mentioned to him several times that he'll be more successful with CBT, but he doesn't feel it will help. He has seen therapists in the past, but has told me that he didn't want to open up to a stranger and would just tell them what he thought they wanted to hear. How do we get past this hurdle and allow him to see the benifits of therapy in conjunction with his meds?"
bipolar,fezz0s8,t3_er14q5,1579463400.0,This is so true. It takes discipline but so beneficial to make those lifestyle changes.

bipolar,felvvzp,t3_epulqj,1579232244.0,"Im proud of you for having the strength to attend a support group. They can be so helpful, yet still so hard sometimes to be strong enough to reach for that support. I know how hard these episodes can be but try and remember it's not permanent. Put your energy onto something positive that can help occupy your thoughts. Doesn't have to be big. Maybe clean out a hall closet or cabinet and gather things you can donate.  What are some of your favorite things to do?"
unpopularopinion,fe6g71v,t1_fe6ff30,1578889927.0,"It's though to be in debt but the important thing to remember is it's not too late to start over. You are now better equipped to make decisions that won't be so tough on you. The debt will eventually be paid,  but you'll never get the time you spent being unsatisfied with your career choices. So be true to yourself."
unpopularopinion,fe62slz,t1_fe5yujm,1578880500.0,"That's so great that you allowed him that freedom and didn't put unnecessary pressure on him. I know it's not the best advice for everyone,  but I rather know I gave them the opportunity to live their life based on their own choices. Kudos to you and your son!"
unpopularopinion,fe2m3dg,t3_eno1rp,1578840348.0,"I tell my boys if you can pay your own bills, aren't hurting you or anyone and anything around you, you do you. There's no rule book that says how you should live your life. I don't care what career they choose as long as they are happy and heathy. College can help, but there are so many different paths you can take and still have a fulfilling life. I really believe there is too much pressure to become relevant rather than living in the present and enjoying your short time on this planet."

aww,fdoghu1,t3_em7y9g,1578604672.0,Im going to send this picture to people when they text me too early. Too cute!
bipolar,fdnfqr6,t3_emamkg,1578584849.0,"My son and I are struggling with this as well. We have tried so many things, even had him take that gene test as well. I feel conned with that test, it basically just says which meds might work, nothing really helpful in the end, just another bill we can't afford. Our next step is going to be some cognitive behavioral therapy with some BP support groups that are offered for free throughout the city. We found a few options on this website https://www.dbsalliance.org/support/chapters-and-support-groups/find-a-support-group/

Hopefully you can find something from this organization that can help you get a little more support that can work along side your meds. Good luck."
stopdrinking,fdndc4v,t3_emaw7d,1578583371.0,"I struggle with this when I'm up in the middle of the night obsessing over my life with a fine toothed comb. The only thing that has given me some solace is when given the opportunity, I've talked to some people who've witnessed my drunken behavior and apologized. I've explained that I had some underlying issues that I was only masking with drinking, and since I wasn't addressing my issues, the drinking took over. I wasn't a weeknight drinker,  but when I did drink on the weekends I drank until I blacked out. I feel I did this because I didn't want the fun times to end and swing me back into reality to deal with my problems. I embarrassed a lot of people, including myself. Thankfully the few people I've talked to have been quite understanding and forgiving. It makes me feel a little better and realize most people aren't hanging onto those memories as much as I am. Its not always the easiest conversation, but I haven't had a negative experience yet. Thankfully you're on a good path. Hopefully you can get some solace as well."
