I'll streamline this: no one gives a fuck about the Frankfurt school and tumblr denizens who don't know what the history and meaning of intersectional actually is. Cultural Marxism is a dead niche and conservatives have tricked you into chasing ghosts. What you're espousing is only a half-step away from THE JEWS ARE BEHIND IT. Because, eventually, you'll have to start identifying actual Cultural Marxists, and you won't really find anyone who identifies as one. So, obviously, it must be a bunch of Jews who are hiding their identity. Weather or not you're a Jew yourself is irrelevant, cognitive bias is a bitch."

You've probably not consumed content that links ""Cultural Marxism"" to Jews yet, which is a good thing. But, now that you've accepted the narrative of ""Cultural Marxism"", the next rung on the ladder is anti-Semitism. The Frankfurt shit is a nifty little handwave, where alt righters pull out a history book and try to prove they're right. Current modern thinking has nothing to do with it, and Conservatives have been using that as code for Jews for literally decades now. This whole thing stretches pretty far back."

Or, have a kitchen is closed time vs building closed times, which can easily bewilder the average idiot customer and lead to confrontation. I'm used to tourists, so ymmv.

Easiest option is simple: no orders after posted closing time. A 10:01 ticket is pushing your luck, and I'm in a corporate chain. Keep it simple, keep it easy to understand, make it clear to the customer that shit is immidiately turned off. If you get a refire, get the KM to crank a burner and push it out as fast as you can."
