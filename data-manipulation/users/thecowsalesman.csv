Mustang,fgv1wdc,t1_fgufhdr,1581134822.0,"  I got it on sale for Black Friday for $7900 however you can get great deals on used kits just be careful obviously. Lethal performance is the website I used they were excellent to deal with.  As for daily drivability it’s great that’s one thing with the positive displacement superchargers they do drive like stock if you’re not in it, stepping on it is another story entirely."
Mustang,fgubzoz,t1_fgu6in5,1581117141.0,You gonna change out to a 2.65? I don’t know if the 2.3 will support that much power.
Mustang,fgtnvk9,t1_fgtgx53,1581107040.0,Are you running the gen3 or gen3r?
Mustang,fgtbjyy,t1_fgt50io,1581102167.0,Whipple gen 5 blower and exhaust right now. Looking at doing fuel system and meth injection next before building the engine for big boost.
Mustang,fgrsoyp,t3_ezzje1,1581056196.0,"I feel that, currently at 689 wanting 1000."

smoking,fgqiz5k,t1_fgqi7gw,1581025100.0,I normally don't bother searing mine and it still comes out great.
Whatcouldgowrong,fgqaxft,t1_fgq6mqq,1581020999.0,I LIKE TAINTS
Mustang,ffz1s4g,t1_ffyvoa4,1580361185.0,It drives really good pretty close to stock when you’re not in it aside from the cracks and pops out of the exhaust now. However when you floor it everything changes it’s hard to explain how fast it feels but at 70 mph I’ve spun the tires.
Mustang,ffyd55s,t1_ffyaasp,1580343584.0,Not sure after a custom tune and dropping 1 pulley size I’d like to be at 750
Mustang,ffxzbp9,t1_ffxu14h,1580335403.0,Yes I did Boundary oil pump and crank gears. I didn't do that myself though I was worried about re timing the engine so I had a shop do it.
Mustang,ffxrze9,t1_ffxomtl,1580331258.0,Whipple provides a tune it was super easy to flash
Mustang,ffx7bb1,t1_ffx6p6m,1580319253.0,Maybe 12 hours total over 3 days. It was not bad at all it’s a lot of work but not very difficult work. Agreed on it being rewarding :)
aww,ffv3leo,t1_ffv2u3v,1580254877.0,Love this one :)
gaming,ffds448,t1_ffdh7wz,1579827552.0,"Really good, but very much so an arcade game there are so sim aspects at all."
aww,ff4sqyw,t1_ff4qb41,1579571555.0,I bit hard
oddlysatisfying,feieplv,t1_fehgg3o,1579136781.0,This is the way.
Mustang,fdoyhpt,t3_emd37h,1578615776.0,Doesn’t sound like rod knock or valve train it’s something lose and vibrating
