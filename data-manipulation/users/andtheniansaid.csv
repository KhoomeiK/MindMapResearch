ukpolitics,fgibjr2,t1_fgi498l,1580815532.0,"> Oxford University’s Energy and Power group reckons we can meet the demand using smart chargers and only an extra 20MW into the grid.

Where are you getting that from? It's 6GW - 18GW extra capacity that's needed:

>The impact on peak demand will depend on the charging scenario. A sensible charging structure would
encourage off-peak charging (thereby reducing peak demand and the need for additional capacity).32
In Figure 5, in the Two Degrees scenario, most consumers charge their vehicles in off-peak periods
and the resulting increase in peak demand is only 6 GW. For the Consumer Power scenario, NG
estimates an increment of 18GW or about 30 percent of today’s peak demand; this reflects a central
planner’s caution, with many consumers assumed to charge at peak times. Even if we take this worstcase scenario, an increase of 18 GW of peak capacity would require construction of only about 600MW
of new capacity a year over the period, well below levels of construction over past decades. For
instance, compare the requirement of 18GW over 30 years with the construction of about 30GW of gasfired generation capacity in the 20 years from 1990.

The vast majority of those are using computers day to day, and a massive chunk of them have access and use a lot of data protected by GDPR. Some of those people can barely stick an equation into excel or open a zip file. Why on earth would you give them anything but a locked down box? What advantage is there to doing so?

The idea that when you have hundreds or thousands of staff you would trust them all to use their computers to secure IT best standard practices all the time is absolute nonsense. Much better to only give them the tools they need and limit what they can do, than risk someone clicking on some dodgy email or installing software from a dodgy site. It's not about losing data, of course anything important should be on servers and backed up, it's mainly about it being stolen."

When people only need certain software to do their roles, there is no reason *not* to lock down boxes. If they need something else they can always just ask and it can be dealt with by IT admins if it's legitimate."
