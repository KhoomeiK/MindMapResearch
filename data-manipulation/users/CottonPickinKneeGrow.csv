I swear Redditors actually think posting/commenting on Reddit is all they have to do to fix a problem, then go back to being the source of the problem which is everyone doing nothing."
WearOS,ff9ov37,t1_ff9mh7z,1579717566.0,"The problem is this argument relies on Wear OS having watch that can compete with the AW or Galaxy watches and there isn't even a new chip in the planning or design stages or even one announced outside rumors.  Even if they announced the perfect chip today it would be 2 years before we start to see him in watches.  Same with a Pixel Watch, which would need to run that chip.

I don't see how the current condition of Wear OS can improve in any reasonable time to make a difference at his point.  It has languished for so long and I don't see it improving anytime soon.  Meanwhile, people continue to buy new Galaxy and Apple watches."

> On August 18, after the first Anglo-French attempt was made in Warsaw to open the eyes of the Poles, Foreign Minister Beck told the French ambassador, Leon Noel, that the Russians were ”of no military value,” and General Stachiewicz, Chief of the Polish General Staff, backed him up by declaring that he saw ”no benefit to be gained by Red Army troops operating in Poland.”


> It would be disastrous [Bonnet told him] if, in consequence of a Polish refusal, the Russian negotiations were to break down . . . **It was an untenable position for the Poles to take up in refusing the only immediate efficacious help that could reach them in the event of a German attack.  It would put the British and French Governments in an almost impossible position if we had to ask our respective countries to go to war in defense of Poland, which had refused this help**
