winemaking,ffdh682,t1_ffdev7z,1579820774.0,"There's always a chance, I've been there before and it tastes pretty nasty. Although if you've sulphured it properly and you're not necessarily going to keep it for years it should be okay"
winemaking,ffbxkf6,t1_ffbx9za,1579786006.0,"If it's non-commercial I'd probably just make a simple syrup with sugar and water. The SO2 will stop any more oxidation, but it's more because if you do add sugar you'll have wild yeast trying to ferment it.

If you wanted another option you could try fortifying it and making a vermouth, or making mulled wine. You'd be amazed at what a few spices will do"
winemaking,ffbwed4,t3_esslt8,1579784981.0,"If I were you I'd run a small trial doing both and see what works best. I've never tried fortifying an oxidised wine, but I've back sweetened before. It probably won't have a whole load of character if you do, but it will make it more drinkable. I'd also think about adding more sulphur if you do sweeten as it won't last long otherwise"

wine,fenm5xx,t3_eq4inp,1579287650.0,"I'd probably start by explaining how varied Chardonnay can be, describing richer, oakier new world styles, then contrasting that to how Pouilly-Fusé and white burgundy in general tends to be much more crisp and delicate."

wine,fen8jvp,t3_eq2lt7,1579279317.0,"What exactly do you mean by 'budget'? For me, $60 would be quite a lot of money for budget wine glasses.

In terms of what is good for not too much money, I'm not sure if it's available in the US, but I'd recommend Dartington crystal. It's pretty good quality and a set of 6 glasses is around £40. Of course if you really want budget, IKEA do decent wine glasses for £2 each, but they're nowhere near as good as any sort of crystal"
winemaking,fel8w5t,t3_epjcgh,1579216607.0,"The advice I was given whilst studying was to have some sort of brand first before you start investing heavily. If you have a good source of grapes and you haven't already, you might be best doing custom crush/contact winemaking for a year or two and seeing if you can sell the wine easily"
winemaking,fed1zm1,t3_eogf2n,1578994705.0,"I'd probably use something like CY-3079 or Zymaflore CX9, although EC-1118 should work fine. If you're unsure on the SG it might be worth buying a cheap hydrometer just to measure it yourself.

Also what do you mean by the usual instructions? Is there something you were hoping to change about them?"
wine,fdmrvdw,t3_em0dd1,1578562701.0,"Not sure how much they'd be in the US but there's a few good wines in the UK I'd recommend for around £20-40

winemaking,fbxkngh,t3_eez0la,1577191883.0,"It should work if you're careful with how much you add and don't over do it. My advice would be to deacidify a small amount as a trial to work out how much you need before doing the whole batch. Also if it's anything like calcium carbonate it will leave a salt deposit, so it's best to add all your soda to about a quarter of it, then rack it back into the main batch to leave the deposit behind. The main thing is just to try it before you fully commit though"
