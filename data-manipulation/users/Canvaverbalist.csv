Par exemple, dans une société qui n'en parle pas vraiment, y'a des chances que tu te fasse attoucher et tripoter dans le métro. Ici, si tu voyais quelqu'un faire ça dans le métro, une fille dans un coin clairement en détresse pendant qu'un dude se frotte dessus, est-ce que tu va réagir? Très probablement, j'espère. Tu te diras pas ""Oh je sais pas trop, je veux pas avoir l'air de ci ou ça..."" non parce que tu le sais très bien que t'as 200% de la société qui te back parce qu'on se répète sans cesse à quel point c'est aberrant. Si tu te lève pis tu dit ""Hey mon calisse, qu'est-ce tu fais là!?"" t'auras pas le sentiment d'être niaiseux ou de déranger ou de briser des normes sociales - au contraire.
