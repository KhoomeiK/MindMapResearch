I’m a 27 year old female and I would much rather have a guy tell me “hey, I think we’re in two different places in our lives right now” than continue to make me believe that things are good. If she’s mature, she’ll understand, thank you for the time and effort you put into what you guys had and move on. At this age, we should all be able to communicate TRUTH with one another. Worst thing that can happen is that she cries and gets upset but just know that eventually she’ll get over it. Being “broken up” with sucks, but it’s part of life. Work on yourself and your career and when the right time comes and you’re ready, you’ll find someone who matches your drive and your hustle. 

Just be honest with her, things will be fine and you’ll have a lot of weight lifted off your shoulders the sooner you do it.

Adoption,fdtbdid,t3_en1llo,1578714373.0,"My parents gave me up for adoption 27 years ago. 
It was probably the best thing they could have done but every situation and outcome vary. I was adopted into an amazing family, both of my adopted parents loved and always made me feel like an actual biological child. The family, kind of but I always felt like the outcast. My adopted parents knew how to save money and be financially responsible, so I grew up high middle class. My biological parents were junkies, my mom was a meth and heroine addict and my dad was the same. They had about 6 or 7 kids all together including myself. I was in foster care for about a year, my foster family from what i see in pictures were loving and I was definitely cared for in their time of having me. 

I suffer from separation anxiety as an adult now and I do deal with being able to feel “attached”  to anyone if that makes sense. I have a daughter who is 10 and I’ve never love a human being the way I love her. I’ve never met my biological family because I’m too scared too look into it, thinking I might be a burden to them by wanting to know them. 

Just think about what kind of adoption you would consider having, open or closed. 
Mine was closed and I think that made it harder on me growing up. But i can also understand why it was. What you’re deciding to do is so appreciated to those who can’t have kids. That’s why parents adopted me and I know they’re so grateful that my biological parents put me up for adoption. 

If I could thank my biological parents I would, what they did really gave me another chance at a good life with an amazing set of parents who always made sure I had food in my stomach, a warm bed, clean clothes and went to a good school"
