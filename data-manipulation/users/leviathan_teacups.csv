The korean music industry is... A nightmare. I like the group this guy is in (EXO) lol. Shit's fucked. He hasn't revealed the identity of his fiancee if i remember correctly and I don't blame him. These bitches be crazy. 

Here are some examples (using this group). Seriously, this is some next level shit:

A crazy ass bitch back in 2014 selling (what they claimed was) a member's underwear for $10. Even going as far as to say there were pubic hairs still on it. 

Another time the group leader found a camera in their practice room and had to tell their manager. I think there were some in their hotel room too. (Even managed to record audio of a previous member showering) 

Had fans grab them in the airport for some reason

Getting tickets to be on the same airplane as them.


It's not as.... Bad as it was when they were ""hot"" (as in, extremely popular. I was there for that lol. I've been a fan since 2013. EXO fans used to be as bad as BTS fans but I like to think everything is more chill now)"

*Hello, folks. Welcome to my ranch. Today I'm going to prepare a delicious Mole Verde. It's one of the preferred dishes of my family and I think you guys will like it as well.*

*Now I am going to teach you how to prepare it!*

*Here I have everything washed. I have* 

*half a kilo of tomatoes, three serrano (?) peppers.*

*three cloves of garlic, half of an onion, sprigs of parsley, one of cilantro, some radish leaves (?), two poblano peppers, four lettuce leaves* ***(iceberg lettuce, I guess),*** *sesame, and pumpkin seeds.*

*Now, I'm going to cook the tomatos with the serrano peppers, onions, and garlic. I'm gonna put a bit of salt so it can cook.*

*And while that cooks, I'm going to chop the poblano peppers* ***(she doesn't say serrano or poblano here but I'm putting this here to differentiate seeing as she only says ""peppers"" w/out specifying which),*** *and here I also have the chicken ready. Now I'm going to chop the poblano peppers and all of the vegetables.*

*This, I'm going to fry (* ***indicating the sesame & pumpkin seeds),*** *in a saucepan without oil. Now I'm going to peel the poblano peppers.....*

*Now I'm going to cook the pumpkin seeds...*

***(this part was a bit difficult to hear because of the loud sound of the spoon on the pan)*** *Well, now after toasting them, I'm going to take it off so they don't get burned.*

*Now I'm going to put in the sesame. This you have to cover because it can jump* ***(at you).***

*Well, now I'm going to preheat the saucepan with oil, I'm going to put a little bit of oil...* 

*While that heats up, I'm going to grind all the peppers and vegetables. I'm gonna put them* ***(she kind of stutters here, but she means that she's going to put them all in the blender).***

*And I'm going to put some chicken broth so it'll come out very delicious.... the chicken broth.*

*Put a bit of salt.*

*Well, now I'm going to put the peppers* **(the grinded up peppers + vegetables from the blender),** *in the saucepan and with that, I'll keep stirring it and keep pouring it in there. I'm gonna put a bit of pumpkin seeds so that they're grinded* ***(grounded?)*** *well. A bit of sesame so they're grounded very very well, so they're not left ungrounded. I'm going to pour some chicken broth, little bit of salt.* 

*Well, now it's done. I'm going to taste it to see if it has enough salt. Needs more salt* **(lol).**

*Now I'm going to let it... Make sure it's boiled well to put it in the chicken. Look at how delicious it looks!!*

 *Now it's boiled very very well,* *I'm going to put in the chicken.... I'm not going to let it boil more  going to take it off soon.*

*Well, I'm going to leave it on for just a bit so it'll be ready.*

*Well, look at how delicious it looks. Now I'm going to serve it to see how well it turned out.... And the peppers... I'm going to serve it with red rice.*
