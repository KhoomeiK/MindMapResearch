Well, good luck with Latuda, hope it gets you through all right."
MAOIs,ffktost,t1_ffhp1zw,1580028678.0,"Yes, you'd think so. I guess worst-case scenario they're moving towards discontinuing Nardil and and are testing the waters to gauge the response :/"
MAOIs,ffh1ei4,t3_esj36o,1579920518.0,"Antipsychotics can be pretty heavy. A TCA, for example nortriptyline, could gave been an alternative bridging agent. But hey, if you're happy with Latuda, there's no problem :)"
MAOIs,ffh0cbp,t3_etjork,1579919711.0,"I wonder if Dr Gillman has any thoughts on the current shortage of MAOIs in Australia (and a few other countries as well). 

It's a scandalous situation. The resupply date for Nardil has just been changed from March to December! 

To make matters worse, the Canadian version they made available for use during the shortage is now also out of stock, for how long is anyone's guess.

These fucking drug companies, I don't trust anything they say."
MAOIs,ffff4gq,t3_et4gz4,1579882599.0,"They're now saying December 2020 for the Australian Nardil to be back in stock ... what a fucking joke ...

MAOIs,ffe4mpg,t3_et4gz4,1579836576.0,So they're saying April now?
MAOIs,ffe4knf,t3_et4gz4,1579836533.0,"I have just enough of the Canadian stuff to last until March, when the Link brand is supposed to be back in stock. If it's pushed back, I'm fucked :/"
Drugs,ffc1mow,t3_esnba8,1579789254.0,"I got into MDMA in a big way back when I was in my 20s. Looking back, I was struggling with social anxiety and was self-medicating.

I was doing pills 3-4 times a week, for about a year. 

When I quit, my anxiety was 100 times worse and  I was very depressed.

I'm now 45, and gave been on and off antidepressants for the past 20 years. I'm on meds at the moment.

I'm not trying to say the OP will be the same. Quite possibly I would have ended up with depression anyway. It seems to go hand in hand wirh anxiety disorders.

But doing all that MD made things worse for me, for sure. It's a damaging drug to get hooked on. Maybe not too bad if you can keep it to very occasional use. Too bad I couldn't."
