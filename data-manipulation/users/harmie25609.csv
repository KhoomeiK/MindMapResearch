Parenting,ff2prfp,t3_er9ztk,1579518327.0,"As a daughter I can tell you why I don't speak to my father, and why I haven't for over a year. 
When I was a child  my dad was super abusive. He beat me over 20.times with a wooden spoon because I wasn't eating properly. I was eating the food he gave me  but he bear me because I didn't eat it the way he wanted me to. He would threaten to hit me with sticks on a number of occasions. 
My earliest memory was being locked in my room as a 5 or 6 year old. I ended up going to the toilet in a tin because my dad wouldn't let me leave the room. 
I had to buy my own school supplies from the age of 11 with my pocket money. I was super stressed constantly because I couldn't buy stuff I needed, like the apron I needed for home economics. 
He would constantly insult my friends. Some of my friends in primary school where not very acedemic. He would bitch about how they were slow. 
My breaking point was when my dad went on holiday with my step mum. He made out like it was only him and my step mum going. About 2 weeks before he left, he told me they were paying for my step sister's to go. I never got invited. I know that they probably couldn't afford to take me and pay for me, but if they had invited me I could have saved up to go with them. I was also pissed that he made it out that it was just him and my step mum going for months  it felt like i was deliberately left out. 
I'm still struggling."
