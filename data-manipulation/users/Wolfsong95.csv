WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ff4xzpc,t3_ero7o5,1579575154.0,That is kind of scary. It looks like his head is detached from its body. Dogs and cats are comfortable in the weirdest positions.

NoStupidQuestions,ff2st93,t1_ff2s0ii,1579522645.0,"Yeah, technically they can be because dogs sometimes hump each other to show dominance (depends on the dog). But they won't have sexual feelings toward a puppy because it's unnatural, unless taught to by a bad breeder."

NoStupidQuestions,fepap1c,t1_fep8zrg,1579315940.0,"I guess technically you can if they don't blur your face. I remember a Youtuber getting in trouble for something like that like 5-10 years ago (maybe a few more). I think it was Shane Dawson. A random woman was walking down the street behind him, and he had to blur the woman's face after she threatened legal action against him."

Sims4,feos8ev,t1_feooh40,1579304700.0,"That's weird. Two of my sims that are siblings had the romantic bar filled a little, but there were no romantic interactions. I thought it was a mod and corrected it with mcc command, but maybe it's a another glitch. Patches have been causing a lot of those lately."
Unexpected,feor8n1,t3_eq1xdv,1579304347.0,That's not really unexpected for Alaska. Alaska is next to Canada and moose kind of just materialize in some people's yards in some parts of Canada.

Sims4,feomwk4,t3_eq83ie,1579302405.0,"Maybe a mod. From my understanding of EA's limits on the game, they block the possibility of relationships like this."
techsupport,feodcb8,t3_eq78q3,1579298623.0,Did you reinstall the game after fixing what was causing the error message? That may be the problem. You might need to delete it and reinstall it. Sorry you may have to sit through that long loading screen again.
NoStupidQuestions,fenlaev,t1_fenkia3,1579287112.0,"That's why I said it's weird to me. Even if the paparazzi is on public land when they take the pic, it's an invasion of privacy. People in California (where this usually happens) can't record each other without both parties' consent, why can a group of people take pictures and then own pics of a person without consent. And sometimes without that person even knowing."
Sims4,fenklss,t1_femjfia,1579286696.0,It shows lol. But at least you'll have cute photos.
Sims4,fenj7k5,t3_eq3zvy,1579285849.0,"Maybe try restarting origin will help. If not, restart your ps4. If that doesn't help, you may have to contact origin."

NoStupidQuestions,fenigfk,t3_eq4070,1579285388.0,"It's kind of like when you have a professional pay to take your picture. You're paying for their use of a quality camera and the effort it took for them to take the photo. Until you pay, the pic is their property.  However, it's still weird to me that the paparazzi can do this without the person's consent."

Sims4,femm4fl,t3_epwa6d,1579262166.0,"I have been experiencing this weird glitch in my game where no sim can have a single baby without me using mcc comand. Every time someone gets pregnant since the last patch, they have at least twins. It's kind of annoying."
Sims4,femlxez,t3_epw6gp,1579261932.0,Maybe now more people will make cc and mods for them too.
Sims4,femlt0a,t3_epvaoz,1579261785.0,"I have an interracial couple with five kids. When they had the last baby I randomly decided to name him Idris after Idris Elba. The first 4 kids all took more after their dad, who's white, and were really light skinned. When Idris aged up, I was so shocked for a sec and then I was lmao because of the coincidence. He was so dark-skinned, like way darker than the mom. It was like the game knew who I named him after. Genetics are so weird."

LifeProTips,fegm976,t1_feglg2k,1579097058.0,"Yeah, I suppose, but I still think getting stuff from your former neighbors is different  to getting stuff you randomly found somewhere."
LifeProTips,fegkr0k,t3_ep20yg,1579095797.0,"I've always been taught to not bring stuff I see on the side of the road home because of stuff like this, no matter how good it looks. 9 times out 10, it's on the curb/ side of the road for a reason. I doubt many rich people just casually leave new expensive objects along the road."

NoStupidQuestions,fegis2m,t3_ep22j1,1579094056.0,"I've known siblings who were only a year a part because their mom had sibling 1 and immediately got pregnant again (like within 2-3 months of the 1st sibling' s birth). So I guess it's possible to have babies really close together, but I'm pretty sure a doctor would recommend at least a year before getting pregnant again. 

However I've been told during the first months after a baby is born, the mom can be super fertile, so to answer your question, maybe a month/ 2 so your body can recover from the first baby and your cycle can return, but I'm not an expert."

I remember a Youtuber getting in trouble for something like that like 5-10 years ago (maybe a few more). I think it was Shane Dawson.

And sometimes without that person even knowing."

He was so dark-skinned, like way darker than the mom. It was like the game knew who I named him after. Genetics are so weird."

So I guess it's possible to have babies really close together, but I'm pretty sure a doctor would recommend at least a year before getting pregnant again. 

However I've been told during the first months after a baby is born, the mom can be super fertile, so to answer your question, maybe a month/ 2 so your body can recover from the first baby and your cycle can return, but I'm not an expert."

It may have been helpful if the movie focused a bit more on what happened between later appearances in court. I was really interested in seeing the community's reaction or even the murdered woman's family. There's a lot if time skipping, so people just know info that the audience just learned, which is a bit annoying. I was already planning on reading the novel, but I was hoping to also see everything in the film."
