discgolf,ff80o9q,t1_ff7jdyz,1579662930.0,"Generally star and champion are very solid plastics. Star generally had a bit more grip, beats in a little faster, and is a touch less stable. Champion is a little more durable and stable. I personally throw a mix of both, along with many other brands and blends.

For starting out, I would probably get a star leopard and champion mako and then see if you have a preference. For the putter, if you plan to throw it as a driving putter (which is a good thing for sure) then again champ or star would be a good starting point. For a putting putter (which should only be used for putting), Dx is fine, but feel free to test out other putter blends, such as JK pro, mcpro. It’s all a matter of personal preference."

The majority of the world is religious and take personal offense to non-believers, but so what, and regardless of any of that it has no bearing on who is right or wrong. A couple hundred years ago no one knew what germs were and the person who first discovered them was shunned and ostracized by his peers - does that mean he was wrong?

Continue to live in your false reality, it’s fine. But don’t act like it’s up to others to prove God isn’t real - that’s asinine. I’m thankful that religions are dying throughout the world and the educated youth are becoming less and less religious by the day. Enjoy your fantasy."
AskReddit,fdoddsv,t1_fdocwwk,1578603089.0,"You are so dense.

I made an equally impossible request to *show* you how ridiculous it is to ask someone to prove a negative, or the non-existence of something. You want me to prove god isn’t real which is like asking someone to prove that unicorns or dragons don’t exist - it impossible to prove the non-existence of somehting. So I apply that same logic to you - prove me to your God isn’t the devil in disguise? You can’t - so does that mean it’s true? Of course not. I cant prove god isn’t real - so does that mean he is? **of course not**."
AskReddit,fdocme7,t1_fdocc3b,1578602728.0,"I’m just using your logic. It doesn’t matter what I truly believe you place the burden of proof on the person who denies the existing of something.

AskReddit,fdobmhr,t1_fdoazax,1578602243.0,"Can’t argue with stupid. You don’t need proof to show something does not exist, you need proof to show that it does. This is a very basic concept used by scientists for centuries. By your logic, anything that the human mind can think of must be real because you can’t prove it isn’t. Do you see how illogical that is? Again, it’s the same as saying Santa is real because you can’t prove he isn’t.

Using *your* logic - I’m going to assert that your God is actually the devil tricking you into do his bidding... prove to me that he isn’t? You can’t, so I guess you worship the devil now."

Your assertion that god is real is no different than asserting Santa claus is real. There is ZERO evidence for either of them existing.

Why don’t you believe in Thor, Zues, Ra, or any of the others tens of thousands of Gods that people have worshipped?"
AskReddit,fdo74vh,t1_fdnt300,1578600052.0,"What does realistic have to do with anything? If god were real and wanted to do it, he would make it so. It’s hilariously ironic that you would defend religion and then talk about things being unrealistic. Have you ever heard of Noah’s ark, Adam and Eve, the parting of the Red Sea, or the multitude of people who lived to be over 500 years old? Don’t talk to me about realistic and give any of those stories an ounce of credibility.

By the way - the burden of proof always lies with the person making the assertion. If you believe that god does exist or that religions have any supernatural connections, please prove it. Asserting that something is not true is not the same as asserting it is. Me saying religions are not divinely inspired does not require proof as that is the default. It’s like asking me to prove that there is not a giant cat hiding behind the sun."

AskReddit,fdlovfi,t1_fdlbpdj,1578528972.0,"Again - that contradicts the judeo-Christian concept of God. I don’t want to be rude, but all you can do is dance around and use mental gymnastics to try to prove a point. The existence of God (or anything supernatural for that matter) has never been proven and anyone who claims to *know* is no different than a child claiming to know that Santa is real. You making up rationale for how a creator God must be thinking or feeling is absurd. You have no valid reason for those thoughts other than trying to refute my argument, but the problem is that your doctrine itself directly contradicts your point of view. The Bible is absolutely rife with contradictions- it is truly impossible to accept it at face value without **personally** deciding what is true and what isn’t, which again contradicts the notion of a holy book of truths."

I am not surprised whatsoever to be downvoted because of this, and it doesn’t mean that I’m wrong.

Ironically, 99% of religious people are the same religion as their parents, were introduced to it before they could form rational thoughts on their own, and somehow believe that they are special while the rest of the world who practices a different faith are misguided / sinners / evil / destined to go to hell.
