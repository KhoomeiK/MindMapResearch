90DayFiance,ff7nz5t,t3_erviw6,1579654117.0,"This might be connected to the level of poverty the family experiences.  I'm sure Nigeria/Brazil has wealthy people, doctors, lawyers and such who aren't in such need.   In that event, flowers -- a desert and such would be more appropriate.  But if your fiancé's family was very poor, and you had the money to buy gifts like this, it would be a good gesture.  Asking for groceries tends to indicate a high level of poverty, does it not?  But the idea of it being expected seems odd to me, and I don't mind helping someone out.  But I don't like the idea of ""You have to buy this"", and I would prefer ""would you mind buying this?  They really need it"".   Jennifer's family didn't seem impoverished at all, and I don't remember her asking Tim to take them a household item.  Or, have I forgotten?"
90DayFiance,ff7m9u8,t1_ff6rfc9,1579652934.0,"I can't tell you how awkward taking a gift like this would be.  The in-laws would be offended thinking ""Does she think we are poor?  why is she bringing me this stuff?  I might even hear ""you keep that, because we don't need it"".  Even a purse would be awkward unless it was a holiday and I knew she wanted one.  I have taken my MIL flowers.  We both love flowers, and they are always welcomed."

90DayFiance,ff4hz5p,t1_ff4hjrj,1579564065.0,You have that changed in the divorce decree.  It's part of the document. Your lawyer just includes it unless you tell him/her  otherwise. She's such a dumbass.  I don't know why in the world she would want his name.  Yuck.
90DayFiance,ff4hoyg,t3_erjoxs,1579563871.0,Damn Angela.  I think most people would have worn an actual shirt to cover that until it healed.  Good grief.

90DayFiance,ff48oec,t1_ff3px3m,1579557958.0,"I saw the opposite.  I thought he was remarkably restrained after her little speech to the producer.  He commented in a controlled voice that he was hurt, angry and frustrated, and who wouldn't be?   He was quiet after that, and didn't act on any of those emotions. He could have thrown an angry hissy fit, but he didn't.  He walked away.  I admired him for that."
