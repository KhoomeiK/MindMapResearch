depression,fek1o97,t1_fejfzjp,1579190705.0,"I got fooled into thinking I have it, but what she puts me through is not love. It’s all been a lie. And to think that I’ve battled all of these physical and mental problems to be here for her and now I realize it was for nothing."
depression,fejvc78,t1_fecbwlg,1579186698.0,"My family never tells me that they are there for me. Honestly, they don’t care about my problems and don’t believe that I’m now crippled, in constant physical pain that would destroy them, depressed to the point of fighting the urge to end it all the time, and basically they just want me to take care of them. I’m in hell."
