The study will be too small. It will be too old. There will be some problem with it. 

But just using logic you can see theres s problem. Theres nothing inherently anti fire about white people. Theres no reason they should be the majority of firefighters - especially in non white majority areas.

Something must be stopping minorities joining the fire service. 

It's a bit like how they want you to prove every extreme climate event that was predicted by climate scientists has something to do with climate change. It's already proven over many years of study and science. 

The claim here that actually needs to be proven is that white men are simply more likely to want to save peoples lives. That's the novel suggestion unsupported by evidence."

It's something ""centrists"" will do a lot now, especially on this sub. It's the ol, right wing are victims card.

Seriously.  The people who call literally anything they hate socialism. They're the ones currently acussing others right.

AdviceAnimals,fedl9qq,t1_fecr5lt,1579014320.0,"Every one is bending over backwards to credit Trump for something that hasn't happened and that he hasn't claimed. And then lecturing anti trump people for daring not to behave the way you imagine they should in this fantasy.

It's especially weird to lecture people that dont like trump for hypothetically doing something g he defintely has done. Not wanting to accept the middle east is safer because of the actions of a president you hate is something trump and his supporters did. 

In fact Iran was better off until trump started to empower the hardliners and weaken the nuclear deal that was already working. 

I sometimes wonder if my life is like that movie where the dude hits his head and the world forgets the Beatles existed. Except I hit my head and like Plato and Socrates disappeared  and now I'm stuck in a world without logic or reason. 

I remember the same happened in North Korea. ""Oh you just dont want to admit trump did something good and saved the world "" he didnt do shit. North Korea is worse off now by far. Trump has failed catastrophically. 

So I'll tell you what. If isis stops existing I'll credit trump. If they continue I'll blame him. If iran transforms into a liberal democracy yay great job trump. If they get nuclear weapon technology from North Korea, trump and his supporters are responsible.
