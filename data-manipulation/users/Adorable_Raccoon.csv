MadeMeSmile,ff7qh0f,t1_ff7n9nk,1579655877.0,"Patience & practice. I like to explain concepts because I tend to invest a lot of time learning how things work. I tend to enjoy activities that take a lot of practice to perfect a technique. Being a patient learner can help you be a good teacher. Things don’t come to me easily but i’m intelligent and determined. I did everything wrong and had learn first hand how to do it right. being able to share what I learned and help someone bypass a little struggle makes me feel good. 

One way I learned how to explain concepts was in a yoga teacher training. One of the assignments was coming up for “creative” verbs to describe actions that weren’t anatomical or yoga terms. That really helped me see how you can say the same action many different ways when sharing information.

It also helps me to picture each of the steps in my mind so that I don’t get side tracked if we have to stop to ask questions. I can kind of make a mental bookmark of where to jump back in."

Some people are just born with different brain chemicals and you keep trying to find ways to make yourself feel better or feel normal. Without the drugs helping you feel right it can make just existing painful.

And transverse abdominus holds the belly & organs in & keeps the spine erect. The quadratus lumborum is the partner muscle for the tva - it extends the back. And glutes are an important partner muscle for the psoas.

Erector spinae are important but will be working with other exercises if you are keeping the spine aligned. And the lats not as important to your spine but they do help keep your shoulders from rounding forward."

toptalent,ff4bepo,t1_ff48e9w,1579559677.0,vocal production really depends on the genre. Dance pop is more heavily edited than folk for example. Maybe you just need to broaden your palette.

The rappers on the sub that do get discussed on the sub (drake, lizzo, lil nas x, nicki minaj) all, not coincidentally, make songs that are dance-pop or dance-pop adjacent (one dance, starships, soulmate, etc) in addition to hip-hop."

Those games will always be for a small section of the population because money & times are precious commodities. Nintendo is more affordable & games like mariokart are more accessible & less time intensive - those will be more popular. But still it is a game & all games are optional.

ArmchairExpert,feoc3u1,t1_femn04t,1579298017.0,trauma is not an excuse to be an asshole. The fact that he is so self aware means he should have to tools to stop himself and not make a friend uncomfortable.  I just listened to the Nadine Burke Harris (ACEs) episode and Dax had 1 point higher than me. I don’t really see how this is really related to trauma. He’s been in therapy longer than me and been friends with monica for a long time. When you’ve been friends for a long time you learn how to adjust to that person. It’s not cool to keep going down the same old path with the same person. He’s self aware enough to recognize the behavior so he should be aware enough to change or stop himself.

ffacj,fen6us3,t1_fe2xr97,1579278265.0,"I think in smaller cities/town it’s harder to find great clothes. There are a lot of malls around here, random boutiques that seem like hobbies for stay at home moms, or consignment shops that target mothers of the bride. I often feel like the only clothes that i buy that will last longer than a year come from the thrift store. Most of the stores at the mall use cheap fabrics like rayons and polyester & the jeans are flimsy. Quality clothes around here are either matronly or too expensive. 

Where would you suggest looking?"
ffacj,fen5a23,t1_fds73nu,1579277276.0,"Srs. I am 5’9”, 160 - not a dainty woman so I can relate. My body is average, boobs, and broad shouldered. i’m not very thin or super curvy. 

I find it’s best to stay away from anything with very feminine elements (ruffles, lace, swishy skirts). style your clothes to accomodate the body you have. 
Heavier fabrics like thick denim & cottons or thicker sweaters are good, they will have balance with your body. Very dainty things can tend to look to childish or “weak”.

Overtime you’ll nail down your own concept of what is feminine. Like to wear high waisted jeans that make my butt look good. I hate showing off my boobs, i own zero low cut tops. I am very very particular so my wardrobe is smaller but i fee better when i get dressed. 

Btw I have hunted for years and finally found high rise jeans that are actually high rise on me - american eagle curvy mom jeans and levi ribcage are both about 12 or 13” rise.

If thrifting isn’t working out I would recommend finding things you like and then looking them up on poshmark. I’ve found the turn around there is pretty quick, i can often find things that are currently in stores on poshmark."
ffacj,fen2pug,t1_fejpuzu,1579275656.0,"Srs  there’s a difference between everyday clothes and dress clothes (my mom called them church clothes). I see a lot of little girl outfits that are dresses + leggings or tops + leggings. Sure there are no pockets but that shouldn’t restrict their movement. I know that a lot of dress clothes for girls are restrictive, but so are the dress clothes for boys (like suits).
