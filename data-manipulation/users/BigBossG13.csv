Summary of what we got from the Audi on the 31st:
Surgery is not on the table yet, we're going to have the left implant off for two days. Trying a new transmitter and magnet, possible referral to the internal doctor if the pain doesn't go away, and I've got another appointment with her on the tenth.
Update 1/3/2020:
Happy New Year! 
Second Update Regarding Cochlear Implants: 
Well, nothing worked. 
It's still bothering me.
Soo...I get to go see the ENT Monday at ten. Yay! Update 1/6/2020 : They think there’s a chance I won’t need surgery :). I'm on drugs for a while, then if those don't work I'm getting a CAT scan, then if it's normal it's because the nerve is sensitive. Which means possibly even more drugs. Woohoo!
Update 1/15/2020: Well, turns out that Martin Luther King Jr. Day is bad news day. It looks like I'm going in for a CAT scan to see if there's something underneath the magnet or if something screwed up the magnet. This means Surgery is becoming more likely by the day. The good news part of it is that it looks like that if I do need surgery I will get it right between my anniversary  months of the last two surgeries, so I can claim I've had Cochlear Implant surgery 3 months in a row..."

Trust me, it’ll get better. I’m sorry your home is shit, but please don’t kill yourself. There’s people who would kill themselves if you did, who would stop living if you weren’t there. There’s more people that care about you then you realize, how devastated your big brother could feel about losing you. I know you’re going through a rough patch, including getting kicked out of school due to mental health. Trust me, it’ll get better. Talk to someone, hell even pick up the phone and call someone who cares now for my sake please. 
I know the shame, the pain, and all of the feelings you must feel. Just hold on, for a person you care’s for sake. Hell, even hold on for my sake. PM me if you need a ear to listen to you, I’ll respond as soon as I can. Please don’t kill yourself."

It’s the best feeling in the world.  Middle School is shitty for everyone, even for the best of us. 
Things can get tough, but  you can always find a way.
It might seem hard now, but that’s okay. 
It’ll get easier with time and trying, and one day you’ll find out that you moved your mountain. Your problem isn’t there anymore. Think of it as a obstacle course you’re going through, and at the end of it you’ll be stronger, smarter, and happier. I’m so proud of you, keep it up. You’re going to do great things one day, and then I’ll be there to cheer you on. PM me if you ever need a ear. Please don’t kill yourself now."
