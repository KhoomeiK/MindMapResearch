My original goal was a bunch of crystalarium sheds, well now it’s that same goal but twice as many crystalariums. I have over 2000 of them running now, in year 13. Takes almost 12 in game hours to harvest them (at +2 speed). I think my total income on that save is 200 million, but I only have 3 mil in current funds. Making robin’s stone more expensive really slowed me down, though learning the rain totem trick was huge boon."

I’ll still take some stone just to get passed the infested and spiral floors, but I don’t speed down anymore. On just bombs and rock candy you can break 100 pretty easy, not to mention desert totems making your time there longer."

It shows that they have a limit on how much effort can be but into a title, as frustrating as they can be. 

I want this series to produce what it’s capable of; with how much they make and how much they have to work with, they could make the best god damn games ever. The fact that they don’t also speaks volumes; the pay checks are more important than the people paying them."
pokemon,fdlcr0t,t1_fdl5io8,1578521239.0,"But they won’t do those things, at least past examples prove they won’t. Look at ORAS, they could have made Emerald or but the battle frontier in, but they didn’t. Gamefreak doesn’t fix problems between games anymore, hell they cut some content to add the rainbow rocket stuff to USUM. Platinum fixed a lot of problems D+P had, and black2 white 2 blew their first versions out of the water. That doesn’t happen anymore, and gamefreak doesn’t need it, too. 

People still have high expectations for these Pokémon games, but there just isn’t a reason anymore. Gamefreak peaked in quality a decade ago, but because of the brand they’ll ride it out. Just like Disney, release the things made years ago for the nostalgia high, and pepper a few new flashy things here and there."

OnlyChild,fdcoqh0,t3_ej21v4,1578280209.0,"Holy shit, first time visiting this sub and your situation is like mine. Only child to a schizophrenic mother. Me and my parents have always had a weird relationship, I consider them more as friends than parents. I lived with my grandparents (on my moms side) since 3rd grade (parents declared bankruptcy a few months later), and my mom moved back home after my parents’ divorce when I started high school; she was kind of a sister (diagnosed at 17), and I never really had a chance to see her as a “mom.”

I’m lucky in that I get along with both of my parents, but you’re situation sucks. I always wish I had a sibling to talk to about all that shit, those years with mom and dad were tough. I’m sorry your dad thinks like that, but don’t let him get to you. I’ve learned over the years to pursue an outlet for emotion, mine being mainly poetry. My mom wrote poetry, and is published (hasn’t written in years), so I also use that as a way to connect with her. Finding a creative outlet is worth it, and if you can, find one. As only children we really can only connect to parents, so trying to maintain that relationship is worth it, though it may be hard. Are your parents still together? If not, your father could be using your mother’s  condition to explain why things failed (and knowing my own family history I wouldn’t blame him); to turn that on to you is wrong, however. 

You can always seek help, and if creative outlets aren’t enough, professional help is nothing to be ashamed of, and I recommend it. I’ve never needed it, but after seeing what has happened to my own family, I would have preferred we had more professional expertise throughout. I live with the idea of having that same illness in my head, and that’s fucking hard to cope with. If you can, connect with your mom. 

Your dad may be toxic, and if you really need to don’t fault yourself for leaving him behind, but he is one of the few family you have. I know when my grandparents are gone I’ll have to look after my mom, and I know even though my dad hasn’t talked to her in years I can count on his help, and that helps. Whatever you’re arguing with your father about, look for compromise; tell him that him coming at you with those accusations fucks with, and let him know how you feel. If he still won’t take you seriously, then move on. Even a break could get the message across. Stand your ground, out sounds like he could respect that.

I’ve always felt that if I did inherit my mom condition, I’d know it, having seen all the signs from the times she was off her medication. You’d know, too, so your dad is just using that as an excuse to justify his actions. That relationship is worth saving, but you have to determine if you really want to or not."

By the time you get to that point in the game, though, you probably have most of the stuff in them donated.

I pretty much buy any stone I need, sometimes gold, but the big shed next to the greenhouse has 63 Statue of Endless Fortune working for me (both of those sheds will eventually be full). I sell a chest full of diamonds at a time, averaging 35 million per chest. I want 2 more large pumpkins on the farm, one near the greenhouse lightning rods and one near the south exit lightning rods, but have not been lucky.

I also don't have any mods installed, I run around every time they're ready. With +2 speed you can be done by noon in game. When I finally get to big sheds, though, I don't know how long that will take. Cabins are just for show, I haven't played any co-op on this farm."

I’ve been spending most time on my 1.4 river farm. I have 20ish lava eel ponds going, saving for the clock. I also have two coils of Dinos just to have them,  and a blob fish pond because farm warp totems mean I can put off the return scepter. 

On the diamond farm I just save up a chest of diamonds at a time, I have 850ish crystalariums going. I’ve sold 2 chests worth so far, a full chest being worth 35 million. Only thing I spend it on now is a shed full of the million gold statues (forget their name).
