psychotherapy,ffh3lov,t3_esdlt6,1579922187.0,"**ANY BLOGS YOU'VE READ ABOUT SOMEONE'S EXPERIENCE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL TO BECOME A THERAPIST OR SOCIAL WORKER? \[US\]**

I just love reading others' experiences about things I am embarking on and google is not coming up with much."
TherapeuticKetamine,ffgheht,t3_ethvcr,1579906284.0,"I've definitely noticed more energy—and even at the times where I still feel depressed, I still have more energy than I used to/can get more done even if I don't want to."
TherapeuticKetamine,ff6tn1v,t1_ff6p2h8,1579634639.0,I really like my doc but she doesn't do lozenges...it kind of makes me want to find a doc who does?
psychotherapy,ff4jwvr,t1_ff4j6yo,1579565400.0,what school are you going to? I'm at Antioch
TherapeuticKetamine,ff48kq2,t3_erjsmg,1579557894.0,"I speak to a therapist afterwards to process and I always start off saying “so...” and staring at the ceiling for a good minute, only to follow it with “words are hard.”"
TherapeuticKetamine,fezhfy6,t3_eqzcd5,1579457398.0,"How have you been feeling so far?

I was also really nervous about the tripping aspect and love it. I think the fact that there's someone in the room supervising and it's controlled makes it a lot easier to enjoy.

...and now I want to try mushrooms when I had never had any desire to before."
TherapeuticKetamine,fev69av,t1_feuxkih,1579393544.0,"1. I do think about that sometimes. I guess it’s mostly the brain fog that really gets to me. I am just so sick of feeling in the clouds. 

2. Getting to a lot of it with my therapist—I’m in the process of turning a constant negative inner monologue around. Ket helped quiet some of that noise at first but still more work needed from me too obviously. 

As for life changes, I moved last year from NYC to CA and I just started grad school to become a therapist. I do know some of it is impatience of settling into these changes :)"
TherapeuticKetamine,fev5gh9,t1_feuwq37,1579393334.0,"I have seen that there have been several people on this thread who are doing better without Wellbutrin so that’s interesting. And yup! Am definitely already in therapy and actually in school to become a therapist myself. 

Doing lots of psychology reading now but will also look into those books, why not"
TherapeuticKetamine,fetdchw,t3_eqae6a,1579374174.0,"I still have a drink from time to time, but my need is a lot less. Not a doctor but I wouldn't think one from time to time (just not the day or so before/after) would do much harm?"
TherapeuticKetamine,fetc8x5,t3_eqexhj,1579373824.0,"Not the sense of smell, but absolutely the seeing where my cleaning slipped when depressed and needing to clean ALL THE THINGS."
psychotherapy,fepizge,t1_fepgsax,1579321722.0,"ah damn, that's what I thought but was hoping it was otherwise :)"
psychotherapy,fep9c8a,t3_ep3qx5,1579315051.0,"**WHEN DO YOU BEGIN BEING PAID AS A TRAINEE?**

I know you get paid once you've graduated and are working on your hours, but what about when you're interning while you're still in school? Just starting my program and trying to figure that out. I'm in CA and going for an LPCC license, if that helps."
TherapeuticKetamine,fem1c7r,t3_epskep,1579236567.0,Somewhat. This is something that reoccurs for me faster than my other depressive symptoms. It hasn't gone away 100%.
PMDD,fehgsd2,t1_fehgb28,1579116224.0,"thank you for responding, I definitely need these reminders <3 I ended up pushing off the meeting saying I was sick since it's not a lie and am starting over today with the presentation when I can have a little more time and am in a better headspace."
depression,fedww7m,t1_fedwv9v,1579021605.0,and also thanks for helping me feel a little less alone <3
depression,fedwv9v,t1_fedwk6y,1579021590.0,"Thanks for the reminder of setting small goals. I was able to move back two calls today that were stressing me out, and I can get a short workout in now and set some realistic study goals.

Part of this is also I don't like the work I am doing (which is also why grad school, to change fields)"
depression,fedwro1,t1_fedwoqq,1579021528.0,This is something my therapist keeps reminding me—you can't control the first thought but you can control what comes next. Thanks for that reminder :)
depression,febeme9,t3_eo1usb,1578958075.0,"I get this. I used to work really long hours full-time but with depression haven't been able to the past two years and have felt guilty about it, too. You and I are doing the best we can and that's pretty damn good <3"
TherapeuticKetamine,fdypqlt,t1_fdvvp6s,1578782332.0,Def more vegetables and it’s dairy and gluten free so I think also just less inflammatory. It’s plant heavy but with animal protein
TherapeuticKetamine,fdxjpk3,t3_enai45,1578769425.0,"I have had same problem with weed and was afraid with ketamine and have been fine. 

Fwiw, when I have had cannabis with CBD, haven’t had those problems."
TherapeuticKetamine,fdwxw8d,t1_fdtr86a,1578763328.0,"The last time, I think I was also a little too anxious to really dissociate. I took 1/4 of an Ativan yesterday."
