The neighbourhood is a rough one, and lots of fundraising was done to build the park and make it pretty.

The whole roof of the van was nearly completely caved in, was just tall enough that our heads slightly touched the roof. Every window (even the side and back ones) were shattered from the moose's legs, or something. Tbh it all happened so fast I'm not sure how all the windows broke. Wish I had a picture of the scene.

AskReddit,ffb5uzn,t3_esnukg,1579752605.0,"While on vacation in a rented van up in Canada, a freaking MOOSE flew ass-first straight through the windshield. The van was filled to capacity, 8 people total occupying all the seats. Not a single person was hurt (besides the driver who had just little flecks of blood from the windshield being blown out in his face)
After maybe 30 seconds of stunned silence from everyone (moose included) We all burst out laughing. This sudden outburst scared the moose who was somehow still alive, and he starts wiggling to get off his back, his horns or antlers or whatever they're called denting the roof in from the outside. We all scramble out, covered in glass that's in little cubes so it doesn't really hurt to move across the seats on. Wierd stuff. We all scatter and moosey-poo tries to right himself but his butt is stuck. His legs are ALL BROKEN, so they flop around on top of himself as he flails trying to get himself out of this predicament. That horrifying image will be stuck in my head for the rest of time."

TrueOffMyChest,ffaw2ep,t3_esldxv,1579745822.0,"Okay so,

My first time EVER in a strip club, I was totally blown away by the acrobatics the dancers were performing.

 At this one point, an absolutely beautiful drop dead gorgeous black woman climbed the pole to spin down it backwards, and I was just SO IMPRESSED. Like wow. I turned to my friend, and I kid you fucking not, at the exact same moment I try to yell over the music so he can hear me, I yell to him ""She's like a monkey!"" the tracks changed over, so for that very quick second of silence, my yelling was broadcast over the whole club. Everyone heard me, including the beautiful dancer. The look she gave me was something I'll never forget. I broke her confidence and made her feel bad.
Security came over and asked me to leave as she left the stage. It was at this moment that I'd realized I'd said something really awful. I hadn't ever associated black people with monkeys of course, cause that's some lame ass racist shit, but it was in that moment that I learned for no reason whatsoever should you ever associate the two together.
I gave $20 to the bouncer, and asked him to please apologize to the dancer for me, and to tell her I really enjoyed her performance and I meant no ill intentions in regard to my comment, just that I was impressed with her skills, that was all. It was an immature thing to say.

Just don't say those things! Racism is still super prevelant today, and even if we don't meant to be racist, or say racist things, the point is saying that word IS racist.

Thank you for coming to my shameful TedxTalk.
The end."
