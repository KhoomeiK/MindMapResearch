They do not realize that Iran is the epitome of religious conviction, and they believe that their opinion suffices as ""basic logic and reasoning"".

I would suggest not spending any more of our time with this, this person is unaware of what Christianity and religion as a whole has done, and would rather comfort themselves from the unknown, waiting for the Rapture with wool pulled over their eyes"
depression,fdy6n0w,t3_en6y4u,1578776617.0,"Life as a whole has been bad for a lot of people for as long as we can look back in recorded history, we just have more access to information now. There are more people on the planet, meaning higher prevalence of crime and injustice. There was a piece in one of Leo Tolstoy's great works in which he deliberated the horror of life, and he came to the conclusion that he was not crazy for thinking life was terrible, but that he had come to the same conclusion as the most powerful of human minds in history

It's okay to feel this way, this whole ""positive thinking"" trend is quite new. And don't mind the ""god"" talk in the comments, religion is just an escape for people who want to close their eyes and cover their ears. What kind of god would allow this? Where was god throughout these crimes against humanity?

It is a part of the human experience, it is why the Stoics believed that suicide was a valid option that didn't need anyone's approval. You're not broken, wrong, or lacking perspective. This is the result of removing the wool and safety nets. I am sorry friend, I wish things were better for all of us"

Here's what I would do at 18: I would not go to University, but rather a short college course for a career path that could be a safe option. Something that offers stable employment with good pay in a short amount of time. Hands on medical stuff is good for that. You can always quit and pursue something else, but you would still have a safety net.

Those are some good options you have laid out, but I wouldn't invest too much time or money into any of them. Working and driving are not as difficult as they first seem. I was scared of both when I first started, but now I realize that if the masses can do it, so can I.

I'd take time to decide for myself what I wanted to do, not regarding the wishes or expectations of others. It's okay to be uncertain, it's okay to not want to commit so early, it's okay to not have something you are passionate about

The depression can be managed, and high stress jobs should be avoided unless you are really interested.

I suck, and I don't want you to end up like me, paralyzed by fear, self hatred, and regret

Your parents seem nice, so you have no rush to get things together. I really wish someone had helped me at 18"
