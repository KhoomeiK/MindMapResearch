This was an intentional explosion to test an escape system for the astronauts. In order to test that they had to blow up a rocket to make sure the escape capsule worked during an actual emergency.

You can let the radiator fluid go for six years and 100,000 miles however it becomes an acidic electrolyte overtime it has a tendency to damage the pump.

The Duratek V6 has a horrible history with the water pump failing at just over 100,000 miles. This is easily a $3000 repair.

By changing the radiator fluid more frequently you decrease the potential for the water pump failure.  

Itâ€™s not a perfect solution but itâ€™s a cheap insurance."

FordExplorer,fcvul3x,t3_ej5wu8,1578010446.0,"That is kinda steep.  Unless you are in a market where cars donâ€™t rust like California or Arizona and command higher prices.    60k miles on a ~3 yo vehicle is pretty high.  Also if it has the Duratec V6 you are likely to only have another 40k miles before you replace the water pump and timing chains  (3k).  

Look around on the web and in your local market.   There are tons of Explorers out there.  They arenâ€™t rare and you can usually get a pretty good deal if you spend the time to shop carefully.

Edit:  since you are in San Diego, look outside of California for the vehicle.    Best bet markets would be Arizona, Nevada and Oregon.   You could get the same car for thousands less if you are willing to go get it or have it shipped.  Check out carvana, car gurus and CarFax.   An example - Only 40k miles, single owner, full records, etc.
