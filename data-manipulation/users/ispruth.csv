It reminds me of 5th grade, where my school had a spider infestation in the vents. Hundreds of baby spiders were coming out of the vents, which I sat right below. I had a hoodie on, so I kept putting them in my big stomach pocket to try to hide them so I could bring them outside later that day. The classmate in the desk next to me started freaking out when they saw a spider crawling out of my hoodie pocket and screamed at the teacher. Class was brought out of the classroom, I got sent outside to take off and shake out my hoodie, school was closed the next day while they called the exterminator"

I am a member of the ELCA (Evangelical Lutheran Church of America), and I like to refer to us as the ‘liberal Lutherans.’ Our political stance is left-leaning on pretty much every subject, from immigration to climate change to women’s reproductive rights. I’m not saying the other Evangelicals are justified, all I’m saying is that not all Evangelicals are blind, gun-toting, MAGA-shouting, white-sheet-wearing imbeciles."
