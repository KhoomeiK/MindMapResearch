therewasanattempt,ffy3ham,t1_ffxhdg9,1580337836.0,"I didn't call your website shitty because of any sort of perceived bias. I never accused your website of any bias at all.  Indeed, I said biases do occur on both sides of the aisle. The website I quoted cites NPR as being left-center. So any bias of your website was never an issue. The fact that it is right leaning is not an issue.

What is an issue:


> consistent promotion of propaganda/conspiracies, poor or no sourcing to credible information, a complete Ilack of transparency and/or is fake news. Fake News is the deliberate attempt to publish hoaxes and/or disinformation for the purpose of profit or influence. Sources listed in the Questionable Category may be very untrustworthy and should be fact checked on a per article basis."

therewasanattempt,ffx26ol,t1_ffwsqcy,1580316153.0,"That's not a partisan issue. Media biases are on both sides of the aisle, and it is a valid criticism. People were attacking NPR this morning for being too liberal. Claiming ""attacking the source is something only leftists"" do is purely facile at best and completely disingenuous and in bad faith at worst.

But to address your question about the Daily Mail, it is listed as:


>QUESTIONABLE SOURCE

>A questionable source exhibits one or more of the following: extreme bias, consistent promotion of propaganda/conspiracies, poor or no sourcing to credible information, a complete lack of transparency and/or is fake news. Fake News is the deliberate attempt to publish hoaxes and/or disinformation for the purpose of profit or influence  Sources listed in the Questionable Category may be very untrustworthy and should be fact checked on a per article basis

>Overall, we rate Daily Mail Questionable due to numerous failed fact checks and poor sourcing of information.


>Reasoning: Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Some Fake News

Conversely, Here is NPR:

>LEFT-CENTER BIAS

>These media sources have a slight to moderate liberal bias.  They often publish factual information that utilizes loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes) to favor liberal causes.  These sources are generally trustworthy for information, but may require further investigation. See all Left-Center sources.

>Overall, we rate NPR (National Public Radio) Left-Center Biased based on story selection that leans slightly left and Very High for factual reporting due to thorough sourcing and very accurate news reporting.


>Factual Reporting: VERY HIGH

Don't misunderstand, I'm not arguing against tipping, I still tip the driver, I'm just wondering where their fee is coming from."

WatchPeopleDieInside,ffwozsu,t1_ffvxt7h,1580307453.0,"Nah, Jean Reno is French, Remi is from the streets of New Orleans. So you would either have a [Yat accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7vlfaMTBWQ&app=desktop) or a [French Creole](https://youtu.be/9E9iHs6S47w) accent, more probably the latter, though the idea of Gambit with a Yat accent is hilarious.

Bonus; [This actor from Shy People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=448ML4aPmD4&app#t=7m00s) has a pretty great Cajun Accent. That wouldn't be too bad either, though it wouldn't be true to the location of Gambit's origin"
