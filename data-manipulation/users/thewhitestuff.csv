""Hey Spotify, if you don't give us X% ownership of your platform then we'll pull our catalog""

""Hey Soundcloud, if you don't start paying a licensing fee or genearting revenue then we'll pull our catalog""

""Hey Music Industry, if you don't do what we say then we'll just hold you up for years in litigation until you're broke and we get what we want""

Then there is this amazing thing called conflict of interest which I guess doesn't apply to the music industry since most the Major's executives and employees also run/operate/have power in just about every aspect of the industry so they also get the write the laws and control policy from the inside to favor them."

You DEFINITELY need to sign up with Harry Fox so you are collecting Mechanical royalties from streaming and Digital downloads.

Also look into someone to collect on your 'Neighboring Rights' we used to use a company called LimeBlue based out of the UK.

Also start familiarizing yourself with sync licensing. There are several platforms out there that help facilitate these types of licenses (TV, Film, etc) and have the potential to bring in some decent income depending on the deal.

One thing to understand about publishing is that it's set up to be super confusing on purpose. There are over 900,000 dinstinct publishing royalties and whatever goes unclaimed after 3 years (55%\~) goes to the Majors. Biggest fucking scam in the game.

Source: Owned and operated 5 record labels for over 8+ years with over 500 million streams and over 250,000 digital downloads. I've worked with artists such as The Crystal Method, Alok, Virtual Riot, Kyle Watson and many more notable artists.

todayilearned,ffjun9r,t1_ffjp654,1580007415.0,"To put things into perspective.. The biggest streaming platform, Spotify, pays an average of .004 per play. That's before you factor in distribution (typically 10-15%) and label (typically 50/50 split after distribution and possibly expenses being recouped) all getting their cut of .004 before the artists gets his/her share.

Hahaha. Nothing to do? You think you just get 10000 people to listen to your entire album much less one track without strategic marketing? Which also costs money.

As someone who ran a successful record label for 8 years with over 500 million streams on our releases. Let me tell you.. That shit aint easy if not one of the hardest things I've ever accomplished.

Did you know Spotify uploads roughly 40,000 songs A DAY. The amount of saturation and competition in the music industry is absurd.

If you managed to pull 10000 unique listeners on an entire album you would be in the 1% who has. Something like 80%~ of tracks on Spotify have less than 1000 plays."
