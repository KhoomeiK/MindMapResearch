zelda,fev5pe9,t1_fep5df3,1579393429.0,"You're right that botw doesn't hold your hand, but it's really easy to progress in botw compared to the old linear games. The old games would have central points where you had to do one very specific thing to continue, or else you are literally stuck. In botw... You can go straight to ganon if you wanted. You could do any beast out of order. You could do shrines, quests, koroks in any order. Nothing stopped you, outside of the tutorial shrines in the beginning."
RingFitAdventure,feglgqy,t3_ep21g6,1579096427.0,"Maybe I'm alone here and I'm not trying to put you or marijuana down here per say, but this is a fitness game by Nintendo. It just doesn't seem appropriate to discuss intoxication while exercising in this sub. I'd say the same thing about alcohol or any other recreational drug."
RingFitAdventure,feggrnv,t3_ep1k9g,1579092242.0,"Could be abused if you do the weakest reps possible but arguably it's still adding exercise that you wouldn't normally do. 

If your playing for fitness, what I do in multitask mode is emulate some of the moves in game. Gives me some varied exercises and bonuses at the same time."
RingFitAdventure,fef609b,t3_eop99n,1579049000.0,I want the island from Wii fit!! I think it's called like woohoo island or something. But it would be fun to have that island remade for an expansion and have something bad happen to all the miis and you need to save everyone
RingFitAdventure,fedvur6,t1_fedoklp,1579020978.0,"Technical issues aside what I hear the most is the squat being too underpowered. People tend to find the squat to be extremely exhausting and difficult, but it does the same damage as ring press."
whatisthisthing,fedl1jc,t1_fedk7gk,1579014165.0,Lol I assure you this happened and I do not own a ring doorbell or camera
selfimprovement,fecoy5c,t3_eobzkf,1578979519.0,"I'm gonna word this potentially terribly but I used to occasionally get drivers anxiety real bad and suddenly. Like, I'd drive fine for days but then one day I swear I can't breath and have to pull over and rest. But what worked for me to get past it was, well, distracting myself from driving lol.

Definitely don't do anything dangerous like using your phone or watching video or reading. I would use audiobooks while I drove. Focusing part of my brain on the stories took a lot of the focus off the anxiety and it helped tremendously. I rarely get drivers anxiety anymore even when I have nothing to distract my mind."
whatisthisthing,fechs54,t1_fechqy9,1578974233.0,What kinks do you have?
whatisthisthing,fecgys1,t1_fecgwtf,1578973679.0,Just wanted to get to know you better
whatisthisthing,fecgo1w,t1_fecgj1k,1578973473.0,Wow that's a very thorough response. I haven't checked out your kinks but it sounds like it could be it
whatisthisthing,fecgfye,t1_fecgcb6,1578973314.0,We did just some heavy storms with wind gusts up to 60 mph. But this happened about 24 hours later. People didn't consider something like that but unfortunately there's no evidence of it.
fitness30plus,fecg33k,t1_fecg01v,1578973069.0,I thought about it but I'd have to consult a doctor first and maybe lose 100 pounds haha
whatisthisthing,fecg0k7,t1_fecfxca,1578973021.0,Haha gotcha sorry
whatisthisthing,fecfxi7,t1_fecft64,1578972964.0,"Not to my knowledge. I've loved here 29 years so I'm pretty confident there is none nearby. It's easy side Cincinnati, OH."
whatisthisthing,fecfdqd,t1_fecfaz1,1578972596.0,"Did you click the article? I highly doubt Venus flashes and pulsed in the sky.

Sorry I gotta edit here

Nobody said ufo or alien. Most people thought a transformer exploded causing the power outage. That's why Duke energy investigated the lines. This was not a bright object in the sky. This was bright flashes in the sky."
whatisthisthing,fecefen,t1_fece9yt,1578971952.0,Does it cause power outages usually?
whatisthisthing,fecdxil,t3_eofb7o,1578971618.0,"So last night some different colored lights flashed in the sky. After the lights flashed, about 600 people lost power for 2 minutes. Duke energy, the local electric provider, followed all the lines in the area finding no reason for the lights or outage. The local news have contacted many different experts to find answers but nobody has any clue what happened. This happened later in the night, around 6:55 PM (when my house lost power). Any ideas?"
fitness30plus,fecbs0c,t1_fecb2vb,1578970314.0,"Not doubting you just a funny story. I started ring fit adventure back up yesterday and did maybe 40 squats and I threw out my back this morning turning on the shower haha. Unrelated I'm sure, as this has happened once before doing something mundane. I think I just twisted it weird"
zelda,fe94ho6,t1_fe91lbg,1578934166.0,"I'm not saying exclude final fantasy from the comparison. I'm saying don't have final fantasy be the only comparison. I also saw metal gear in there above which is fine also. I'm trying to tell you to include everything, including games from other consoles. Turok barely tells a story. GoldenEye hardly tells the story from the movie. Spryo doesn't tell a compelling story compared to Zelda. Croc has a garbage story. Quest 64 is the worst storyteller of them all. Final fantasy generally tells stories better. Metal gear tells stories better. Zelda, OoT, in my opinion, is *slightly above average*."
zelda,fe8ya4h,t1_fe8uzuy,1578932307.0,"Below average compared to what? The large majority of the 90s games didn't have story telling elements at all. I think saying Zelda is slightly above average is more than fair. And it's not fair to compare story telling games like most of square's line. Metal gear is a better example of a better story telling game because it's not largely a story filled with turn based combat. But looking at the n64 lineup? A lot of games with very little story at all. Zelda may have not been an Oscar worthy performance, but it was above average compared to it's peers."
zelda,fe7sr45,t1_fe6nw8f,1578918856.0,I said slightly above average. Pointing out heavily story based games doesn't prove me wrong.
zelda,fe5l9ox,t1_fe5i03x,1578870914.0,"For the time period, story telling in games was virtually non existent all around. Games which tried usually sucked at it. That being said, id put the Zelda titles at slightly above average considering the games of the 90s/early 2000s. Flaws included, the game had moments"
zelda,fe5duc8,t1_fe5dhdk,1578868207.0,"Like, I get it.. but link didn't necessarily know he'd see saria again or vice versa just days later. Why would seeing each other again change the heartfelt goodbye in the moment? The rest sure yeah whatever"
RingFitAdventure,fe59ka1,t1_fe56p57,1578866845.0,This I like. It keeps it under control but gives the sub wings to spread and maybe gather some attention.
zelda,fe4yz9e,t1_fe4r9r5,1578864147.0,"Or, IMO, any Zelda since the 3D ones. They aren't story games, but they all have stories. OoT has plenty of fine story moments"
RingFitAdventure,fe4ju6p,t1_fe4jd1w,1578860096.0,I'll give memes this: they build interest and keep communities alive. Might even help build interest in the game if any posts go viral. Most posts here barely have any activity.
selfimprovement,fe4ghd6,t1_fe35xk4,1578859090.0,"His first line after the title was something along the lines of ""by changing who I am"". Then talked about how op was going to improve their life. The hate came from pretending to be suicidal with the clickbait title."
RingFitAdventure,fe4bdjx,t1_fe49iwu,1578857559.0,"You could still post fanart here, just make it a text post with a link"
RingFitAdventure,fe3tiuz,t3_enpyr0,1578852691.0,TBH I think the memes are the problem. Memes themselves aren't bad but they can consume a sub and then that's all you will have.
DecidingToBeBetter,fe3acr4,t3_eiyc7m,1578847467.0,"January is just my kick off month. Today at work I will eat a salad, *mark my words!!*"
selfimprovement,fe2va4s,t3_enolnu,1578843265.0,I'm happy for you to make these changes but try to remember how your words can effect people. You're pushing people away right now and it will only serve you harm. Don't make change difficult on yourself and try to learn to read a room.
selfimprovement,fe2pkqo,t3_enm6v0,1578841513.0,"I think this is a mixture of pain from a previous relationship combined with a natural fear of falling behind, which we all experience. I got married young and so this is something I'm not used to feeling myself, but I've met lot of people who had these feelings.

I've seen friends feel unhappy when their plutonic friends get married. I've seen exes feel unhappy, just like your saying. But across them all, to me, it ultimately came back to feeling left behind.

That being said I think you are in a better position than these people. You've taken the time to work on you! And that's honestly the best advice I try to give people. (You don't need to be married young, take advantage of your time now to improve yourself!) So, unfortunately my advice to you is lame.. just take the time to let this pass and keep working on you. Through more self improvement you'll distract yourself from your ex. Hopefully you prove to yourself and anyone else that you are in control and you are happy with who you are!"
selfimprovement,fe2n5ey,t3_eno12m,1578840806.0,"Probably not a super unique answer.. but Harry Potter actually did some wonders for me. I had read them when I was a kid, and watched all the movies a few times in my life, but never revisited the books until much later in my life. I had just turned 29 and went through each book via audiobook. 

It's not a self help book or anything, but it definitely was inspiring and entertaining. I guess my point in this response is you may find help in odd places. Listen to other responses to this thread, maybe just explore r/books and find something there too."
DecidingToBeBetter,fe2lbn2,t3_enku3x,1578839866.0,"I often fail because I'll make a mistake. Typically the big task I struggle with is having a healthier diet and losing weight. I almost always do good for a week or two and see small results... Then I'll eat a whole large pizza for dinner one night. That's when the guilt and defeat washes over me and suddenly I can't get out of my head ""I lost"". 

Well, I'm trying to remember that I didn't lose. I made a mistake and I need to forgive myself and keep going. Mistakes are natural, and they don't mean you lost."
fitness30plus,fdzwdmc,t3_enf4os,1578797396.0,"Really want to stress on the rest a few days remark. Many people will see a day of rest as ""missing"" a day. Well, it's not. It's a rest day and if you start up again right after then you are right on track."
RingFitAdventure,fdy67e0,t3_end6lv,1578776519.0,I'd recommend to not focus on it as a tool to be healthy but try to keep enjoying it as a game. Don't make it feel like work!
selfimprovement,fdsfsa7,t1_fdsejmt,1578701780.0,"Furthermore, invest TIME in yourself. People will try new tips or ideas but don't see the results on day 1 or 2 and give up. Time is the answer, unfortunately."
DecidingToBeBetter,fdsfkbq,t3_emyofc,1578701621.0,"A lot of the replies here are great but I want to add some emphasis on time. Unfortunately, none of these suggestions will just fix the problem and what's even less fortunate is that time is ultimately the cure. It's gonna hurt while you wait, too. But the ideas you see in this thread are what will help pass the time and ease the pain. Good luck."
fitness30plus,fdr9pl1,t1_fdr62cq,1578681470.0,Thank you!! Reddit is a central part of my life and I've gotten myself in a bit of a negative feedback loop so here's to positive changes!
fitness30plus,fdr9mxt,t1_fdr5m61,1578681426.0,"My main profile is heavily linked to my life and I'm to the point where I just feel negative. My routine is basically using Reddit like a newspaper. I check out the front page, then I check politics, news, etc. Then I check on my interests which are varied but I often fall down a rabbit hole of video threads like cringe or instant karma. And while they aren't explicitly negative, I find the entire atmosphere is negative. Even people celebrating bad things on bad people makes me feel cynical in the end. I don't like these feelings. Now I hope my daily routine will be about positive thinking and self improvement. Maybe learn to be forgiving to the bad people rather than celebrate their karma."
DecidingToBeBetter,fdr3s1e,t1_fdqe4nu,1578679134.0,Hope you the best!!
fitness30plus,fdr3gce,t1_fdr1elj,1578678960.0,"I used to be able to run several miles without issue right out of high school. I'm now 100 pounds heavier and cannot handle much physical stress. Good on you for making these changes, I'm starting today to make those changes myself!"
fitness30plus,fdr28bb,t3_ems57w,1578678470.0,This is a new Reddit account I made to try and spin some positivity into my life. I only added subreddits which focus on self improvement and positivity. I'm trying to take a step in a new direction to make a healthier mind.
