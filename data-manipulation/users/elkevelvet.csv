alberta,ffcm1t2,t1_ffci9lt,1579802325.0,"I'll persist in this discussion not to be annoying but it's interesting, I hope you take it in that spirit. Not trying to be ""right"" about this, just enjoy thinking about words and how we use them.

I think the focus on Alberta is derived from the significant impact of the energy sector in this province and nationally, and some of that focus takes the very human form of envy and negativity so in that sense a casual use of 'entitlement' to describe what we see here over the 70s, 80s, etc. is not all that interesting for our purposes. I do think that any economic boom for any population would produce similar results, it's not like Albertans are uniquely predisposed towards certain behaviours.

That said, I do view Alberta as the epicentre of certain trends that are prevalent everywhere in the country.. prevalent, not to say total and all-encompassing but definitely trending. And 'entitlement' is a useful word to describe the trend. People have expectations based on what they observe and how they live day-to-day, and often these expectations are unexamined, they're simple ""that's the way it is now, we all own sleds and we all take vacations."" When I compare how friends who worked out of town describe camp life in the early 90s vs. end of decade, mid-2000s, etc. there are clear changes over time there, also. The way they described this employer vs. that employer, the food provided at camp, then the amenities, and so on. 

My impression as someone who did not get employed directly in that sector is that there was a period of inflation of amenities as companies became more competitive for workforce, and certainly in conversation this made an impact on what people expected when they'd be away from home. Again, the word 'entitlement' is not way out to lunch if we are describing changing attitudes over time. Is it too narrow to say 'entitlement' should exclusively refer to whether someone who was once paid X amount will refuse to work for less?"
alberta,ffcg7lv,t1_ffajdgv,1579798778.0,"I take your point. Again I'm presenting a story so that has limited scope, it's not like a study.. I will say in the case of the roofing company, two of his workers were single males and they traded a decent wage to travel quite a ways and work out of town for a much higher wage. The trade-off resulted in more disposable income, and for a stretch of time that was the deciding factor for some workers from what I could see in this area (north of Edmonton): earn enough to be comfortable in your community, or work in the patch and earn enough to be flush.. the Honda/Polaris dealership speaks to what I mean by 'flush' and my friend and fellow Lions member at the time who worked at the Ford dealership would often talk about the young guys getting after-market work on their expensive trucks, the amount they were dropping on custom shocks and stuff so they could go bogging.. I mean, a narrative that shits on Alberta workers for being spoiled and entitled is tiresome but we're not being honest if we pretend there weren't gravy times when cash did flow and people did get used to unrealistic expectations. That is my point."
alberta,ffaivpu,t1_ffaf59f,1579736813.0,"This is anecdotal for what it's worth, but the young guy in my rural N. Albertan town (local, local parents) had his own roofing company and he did my mom's house.. I ran into him shortly after and asked how things were going, he had to shut down the company because he could not compete with oilpatch wages for skilled and semi-skilled labour (this was back before 2012 but after 2010). Another concrete guy had similar issues with maintaining a crew and eventually he just went to work for a larger outfit vs. deal with the headaches of trying to maintain his own small concrete crew and trying to keep decent guys before they'd fuck off to something oilpatch or oilpatch-related. 

There have been times in this province when a lot of manpower was sucked into the big projects and people totally earned big money. And yes, it did attract a lot of folks from other provinces. Maybe some people are over-stating the ""entitled Alberta worker"" buzz but from what I saw, it was kinda for real. One more example, I worked concrete in Edmonton for about 2 years prior to 2010 and it was really hard to find good guys for the crew, my boss was also not easy to be around so there's that.. But he treated the finishers and equipment operators like gold because he was never going to match salaries if they fucked off to work in McMurray. One guy was kicked out of camp for drug use, pretty sure he was on meth the 2nd week he worked our crew (and was caught doing stunts in the bobcat)."

I strongly recommend you contact the Faculty of Business and request a call from a Program Advisor. Part of what we fear is all the stuff we guess or imagine, and once you have some clear information you can decide if you want to move forward. You can send a request via [business-support@athabascau.ca](mailto:business-support@athabascau.ca).

If you spend a day going through the various site links on the main AU site and the Faculty of Business site you can gain a decent idea of what to expect. There's a general orientation you can click through, you don't need to be a student you just have to register for it with an email address. 

A big indicator for success in online studies anywhere is your personal motivation and the degree to which you proactively find the information you need. There are people who can help with that once you take your first steps.

Final note.. a lot of people working FT are happy to get 3-4 courses done in a year.. Even one course during a tough year.. So it really depends on your goals and your capacity to integrate work on your courses with all the other demands in your life.

alberta,fehu9o1,t3_ep7z6p,1579123988.0,Is this that tiny slice of history when Big Oil barely even tried to hide its contempt for the notion of 'corporate accountability' before we entered the perpetual present of war lords deciding who gets what how?
hockey,feho68b,t1_fehmlvs,1579120513.0,"hey fuck off we're trying to be petty here

;)"
hockey,feho0lw,t1_fehk30u,1579120422.0,">When did being petty in a sports rivalry turn into a bad thing?

isn't it part of the deal to characterize the other team's fanbase as being deficient compared to your own fanbase tho? you pretty much said it yourself, there's something petty about the way some people express their allegiance to a team."
comicbooks,fehk36p,t3_ep5e6m,1579118157.0,"Moore's ""Swamp Thing"" run with Totleben and Bissette will always hold a special place in my heart.. I was buying those comics as soon as they appeared on the rack back in the 80s. Then Moore's ""Watchmen"" and ""V for Vendetta"", and Miller's ""Dark Knight Returns"" and ""Batman: Year One"".. and more recently Vaughan's ""Y: The Last Man"", ""Saga"", and ""Paper Girls.""

So looking back it's Moore, Miller, Vaughan for me."

base unit of measurement is hard to define but closest estimate is the volume of fart gas you can store in a cowrie shell = 1 shtinkel and 666 shtinkels = a fuckton"

1 Kenney-ton = countless fucktons of whatever the worst thing you can imagine"
alberta,feekwod,t1_feek1vt,1579035828.0,at one time didn't wearing a CG coat usually mean you pretty much needed it for Arctic research? thought it was exclusive to people who worked in extreme environments.. now it's just another lifestyle brand
alberta,feef6bi,t1_feeecag,1579032500.0,I may not share the venom of this statement but I am certainly disinclined to worship at the altar of this particular brand
science,fdr7asj,t1_fdqpe0u,1578680503.0,"the way you've distinguished between Old Norse and Norwegian has a suspicious lack of academic rigor to it... But immensely satisfying :)

my gal and I started watching ""Vikings"" on Netflix, it's a bit absurd but entertaining. inspired by the Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok"

books,fdoim5u,t3_emd535,1578605893.0,"I read these books only a few years ago but my recall is so damn poor

I remember feeling like it was time well spent, I talked about them while I was reading them.. A scene where the guy's horse is wounded in the neck and he spends the night trying to save its life always struck me. Which novel features the trapping of the wolf and attempted repatriation? It was beautiful. 

I'm not a conscientious reader."
comicbooks,fdo8c4z,t3_em9qmg,1578600644.0,"So I just 'discovered' Tom King via Mister Miracle, does he have the Midas touch or has he put out some stinkers too?

Edmonton,fdo815g,t3_emb73x,1578600494.0,"Hey all the gatekeepers out there.. a lot of city subs feature a fair bit of traffic related bitching and moaning, get over it

Subscribe to another goddamn sub if it bugs you.. The act of driving daily is the single highest risk factor in the average person's life and when you have a close call, well forgive those of us who vent on a fucking city sub about that."
pics,fdo6qor,t1_fdo6fq9,1578599861.0,"like a lot of stuff context matters

you'd have to be hyper-sensitive to the perceived insult to jump to that generalized thing when the highly specific thing is explicit"

worldnews,fdnoyos,t1_fdnm4xd,1578590183.0,"Interesting question. 

The trouble with populism in a democratic republic like the US is, you simply cannot satisfy everyone all the time. So we instantly need to ask: which mass of people are happy by what you purport to represent, and which mass of people are gonna suck it?

Add in the mentality of a non-insignificant percentage of the population: the President = the father or the Top Guy on Your Team. Let's take the Father version: do you parent? You know that giving your kids what they want all the time may not end well. Sometimes being a good parent means enforcing something that is not popular by the reasoning of the kids in the household. And there are countless reasons why the team approach is not helpful. 'Popular' = skill at winning, and you create a need for an opposing side at all times to ensure someone is always losing. In reality we all win some, lose some, and we're often our own worst enemy.

At the end of the day, it's one thing to be popular (for a variety of reasons) and entirely another to attempt to appeal as a populist. The latter is very rarely anything but a con."
Edmonton,fdna62s,t3_em2x5y,1578581309.0,"Over the past 10 years I have dealt with the Serenity group twice and I'd recommend them to anyone.

I also recommend you spend the money to sit with an attorney and put your affairs in order, I've worked with Quantz Law and they have offices in Edmonton."
videos,fdlhdxh,t1_fdl5f41,1578524061.0,"no kidding, we used to have pellet and BB gun wars before paintball guns were a thing

they kind of break the skin if you're within range and stuff but if they hit fabric e.g. denim they don't penetrate

obligatory that's what she said"
