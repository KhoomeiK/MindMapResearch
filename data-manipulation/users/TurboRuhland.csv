To accommodate maximum launch angle. Every hitter makes changes, but he’s not been doing it with launch angle in mind. Maybe his adjustments created a better launch angle, but that’s not what he set out to do.

Whatever feels good to you and produces results you want is what you should be doing as a hitter. Hyper-focusing on launch angle is probably a bad way to go about it actually."

Beltrán never did manage a game for the Mets, but they decided to voluntarily part ways.

Neither of those transactions was due to a punishment or suspension handed down by the league, it was just the teams trying to head off bad press basically.

Arguably the Beltrán thing will end up making the Mets better anyway. From what I’ve heard Rojas was a heck of a minor league coach."

CHICubs,fezpm49,t1_fez2piw,1579460075.0,"I guarantee you’ll see it. Check your bill for a “regional sports charge” or something like that. They bust out the transmission fees into surcharges like that so they can do 2 things:

1: Tell you one price for cable and then mention “plus other fees and surcharges” and then you’ll pay more than what you thought you would.

2: In their own words, it’s to be more transparent about the cost of stuff like local broadcast retransmission and regional sports transmission fees. Channels Big Ten and MLB and Marquee cost the cable company a lot of money to carry, so they do pass that cost onto the consumer.

No one in this situation is coming out good, but at the very least I want to side with the cable company because they want to spend less money on the channel which has the incidental benefit of being a smaller cost passed onto the customer. But then again, the broadcaster has a right to charge whatever they deem the content to be worth.

Capitalism.

I will say, the cable/satellite TV model is going to have to change soon. It costs so much for what you get, and with more and more “must see TV” content moving to streaming services, something is going to have to change. The cable companies at least have a leg up there because they have internet services that are still important to a cord-cutter."

And even if the shoe doesn’t quite fit, people are quick to assume the worst in others, especially those who are already espousing values that touch dangerously close to Nazi ideology.

Sure, people might not be exactly like Nazis, but the word has become synonymous with fascist racists, of which there are entirely too many of in today’s world."

Probably, and if even if we won, the Dodgers were probably gonna get us in the CS again. But 2018 was not a collapse. Not like 2019 “losing 9 in a row in the second half of September” collapse."
