SuicideWatch,fej4be2,t1_fej43h5,1579156384.0,"I thinks dad's deserve just as much time as moms and she doesn't think that way. I need to just handle myself better, I get worked up when I talk to her and I get upset when she doesn't value the little time I have with them."
SuicideWatch,fej3yzf,t1_fej3pg8,1579156017.0,"But I don't want to fight their mom for that time, I know how it will make them feel and what it will show them."
SuicideWatch,fej3fyr,t1_fej2y74,1579155451.0,"But I only get to spend 2-3 days a week and every other weekend with them. I used to see them everyday when I came home from work. I don't have the time I used to with them and fighting for every second is draining on me and I feel like it's taking away from them. I just don't know if I'm a burden. Like maybe I'm taking away more by fighting and struggling than I could contribute to them if it happens. But if I never did that then maybe they could have a calmer life with less pressure? Idk man, my head's fucked."
SuicideWatch,fej20kq,t1_fej0y49,1579154000.0,"I've gone to a couple counselors and I just feel like they try to make you feel better about where you're at instead of giving actually guidance. The note that I keep adding to is a suicide note to my children, very apologetic. They might be considered 3 different letters but they're to my children. They're who I'm here for now, ya know? It's just basically how I'm a failure and how they shouldn't be like me and how I wish I was able to give them the life I wanted to give them when they were born. I have to fight for every minute I get to have them and I know they see it and in their little kid mind they feel like they are obligated to help each parent without upsetting the other and idk if I should even be here to feel that way. I should give up. I failed as a father."
SuicideWatch,feizsfh,t1_feizdf1,1579151913.0,"Right. It just passes your feelings onto others. I wish so much that it wasn't the case, because I want to give up so much. I get so down and dark and the thought of who I'll let down if I do gets me back up. I just imagine what they'll have to think about and deal with if I did that to them. It's so hard tho. I know it's so hard. Sometimes thats all I have to keep me from doing it; that it's selfish of me to throw that on them. I wish so much it wasnt like that but honestly, that's what it is.

I know I'm not supposed to say that, about the guilt I would feel, I'm just saying sometimes that's all the keeps me from doing it. I wish I had an answer. I wish I knew how to keep from feeling like this. I'm being honest."
SuicideWatch,feizjsy,t1_feiz5yy,1579151701.0,"Dude, highschool is just a drop in the hat and when it's done and you move on, a whole world opens up. Your parents want whatever makes you happy. Nothing you do will waste their time, they'll see it as a failure on their part. If you can see the big picture, that you'll live till 80 at least, you're just in the first 1/4 of your life, a lot changes. Keep your head up."
SuicideWatch,feiz6ff,t1_feiod54,1579151372.0,"I have suicidal thoughts a lot. I've tried a couple of time and been interrupted or something stopped it. It's hard for me and the struggle has to deal with the very clear fact that the pain associated with suicide is passed on to others. I know the feeling of loneliness and that no one cares about me but in reality there is always someone. The pain you're feeling when you do it isn't gone; it doesn't go away, it's just passed to the living. That guilt is a huge factor I struggle with. I hope my thoughts don't overwhelm that guilty feeling."
SuicideWatch,feiyhk5,t3_epeihh,1579150771.0,"Sometimes, the person just needs to feel like it's ok to not be ok. They just need to feel like they aren't failing life by having those feelings. Just be with her. Just sit with her. Don't make her talk or push the issue, just be there, in her presence. I'm not sure that even drs know why people feel the way they do, it's kind of a guessing game. Just be there. And be ok with her feeling that way and let her know that it's ok to feel that way but that you're with her because you care. You could try sharing a humiliating or sad or secret story with her to show her it's ok to ask for help in someone else helping with carrying the feelings and burden."
SuicideWatch,feixzq1,t1_feixr1h,1579150350.0,What is causing you to have those thoughts so young? Is it about being afraid of being who you are in fear of being persecuted for it? I used to have those thoughts when I was younger but I just couldn't get rid of the thoughts of making people sad about it and it mostly went away in a couple of days.
