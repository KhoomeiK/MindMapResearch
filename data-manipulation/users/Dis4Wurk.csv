I filed for divorce after I found out that while I was deployed she was cheating on me with numerous men and her traveling OCR group was basically an orgy club. The fight that led to this event was actually a result of that discovery, though I hadn’t filed yet. 

A friend I always secretly had a crush on was abandoned by her husband and she apparently had a secret crush on me, too. We have been official for about 4 years now. So, we moved halfway across country close to her family, bought a house this past fall and are getting married this summer! Hopefully we will have a little one on the way some time this year!

But, had she not decided to take the hotel option, I would go to jail so they could separate us, and the only way to hold me longer than 24 hours is with a charge, so they would charge me with domestic violence in order to do so, therefore it was my “lucky day.” Straight from the officer’s mouth."

She let me leave, then called the cops and told them I was drinking and driving. I was parked in front of my friend’s house 2 streets over when a cop stopped and told me what was going on.

Then you chose to insult both me and my pets. So you can fuck right off. 

That cat is having a painfully obvious fear based reaction to the jump, if you can’t see that then you should never be allowed around animals, period. Idiots that don’t know how to read behavioral cues from animals is exactly how innocent pets get put down because jack asses like you think they know better and end up getting bit or clawed.

That is an estimate, all animals are different. The true metric for health is body fat percentage. I’ve had one that was full grown at 11 lbs. It very much depends on which breed they get more of their genes from, if you have one with more Turkish Angora or Burman, then it will be small and soft with a shorter coat. more Maine Coone? Gigantic, with a large bone structure with a thick and long coat. That’s like saying a person that weighs 170 lbs is unhealthy and fat, not taking into account that person could be 6’4. At 5’0 yes unhealthy, at 6’4 not at all. My cat can reach the counter with his front paws while his back paws are still on the floor. He is hangs off the edge of my fender 100 guitar amp while tucked into his Sphinx position. He is just genetically a very large cat, and since they eat a raw diet, a very low body fat percentage.

We all know about it. It was isolated back then, but since the expansion of the ghetto out of the north side over the past decade, its been prominent everywhere.

I was robbed at the gas station a block from my house last month, didnt have my concealed on me because I was just getting gas for work the next day. This city is going to shit."

I can sleep almost indefinitely, after about 20 hours I’ll get heartburn, but I could keep sleeping with an antacid. My SO calls it my superpower. I know it’s not healthy but I love sleeping so much. I wait till the last possible minute to get out of bed, even 5 minutes before that I feel like my body does not have the physical strength to move.  It’s really annoying that the only thing that can get me up is panic for being late to work."

I had never been in those kinds of temperatures before and they aren’t common for this area, I’m pretty sure they were putting out broad, over the top warnings to prevent as many exposure injuries as possible.

He said hands down it was in the Arctic, he told me, you see a lot of stars out in the middle of the ocean, double or triple that. I have seen the stars from the middle of multiple oceans and seas, I couldn’t even begin to imagine what the night sky must look like there."
CatastrophicFailure,fg380bu,t1_fg2y7c6,1580473858.0,"I live in the Midwest USA, last year we had a few days at -55 F (-48.333 C). We were told to wear sunglasses or goggles if outside for more than 3 minutes or the moisture in your eyes could/would freeze your eyeballs, 3 minutes of exposure can cause frostbite, and you HAVE to breathe through your nose. Your nose warms the air entering your lungs, if you breathe through your mouth when it’s that cold your lungs can freeze. It was kinda neat pouring water out and watching it freeze before it hit the ground though."

But to your other point, it’s right in the name of the mission group and ship. One is a carrier group, the other is an ARG or amphibious readiness group. One is an aircraft carrier, the other is an Amphibious Assault Ship LHD (Landing Helicopter Dock). I was never even in the navy, so I’m not sure how only “big Navy” understands the difference. They have two completely different missions and purpose. Not to mention the difference in length is about a football field in length. 100+ yard difference is pretty large.

Also, Carriers stay far away and deploy air to air and air to surface fixed wing aircraft, and now tilt-rotor. LHD Amphibious assault ships have a battalion of ground troops, tanks, LTVs, LCACs, humvees, along with their aviation element, and their purpose is to deploy ground troops in a short amount of time."

And then I can run my swarm and a pulse or a Randy’s. I also don’t like relying on 1 person to pop shields. The way my team has our build, every element is covered 3 times. We can run the master NF then a master Hunt back to back without changing anything. It works for us."
