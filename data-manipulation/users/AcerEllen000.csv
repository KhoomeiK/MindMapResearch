I read through some of the comments below the article, and this one provided some interesting info -  this goes a long way into explaining why WHO is so against vaping....

""The World Health Organisation is no such thing. It is the lobbying arm of the Pharmaceutical corporations that fund it and it exists first and foremost to help maximise the sales of their products which include nicotine patches, gums and inhalers, but does not include e-cig products.

The WHO is similarly repsonsible for lobbying for 'health' legislation to maximise the profitability of the pharmaceutical industry rather than improve public health, for example the legislation to restrict sales of e-cig products by classifying them as medicine and thus subject to restrictive (in terms of sales) regulation.

Use a dog bowl so she becomes accustomed to it and associates it with food- that way when you put it in the cage she will already be familiar with it. Don't wash it after she eats from it, so it will have her own scent on it.

unpopularopinion,ff8sat1,t3_es9xc9,1579694140.0,"I suppose we tend to be this way because humans are essentially still mammals, with a tendency towards tribalism... which in itself derived from belonging to either packs or herds.

It has positive and negative attributes- we want to fit in and be a contributing part of the pack, while also at times going mindlessly along with the herd. For some people fitting in successfully requires being proud of what they belong to... else, what's the point? 

I'm not saying it's good- but perhaps the first step towards understanding the system is understanding how and why it came about- and then take steps towards making improvements, in order to prevent it sliding into the nationalism and bigotry which the OP mentioned.

A personal aside- when I attended my parent's memorial service some years ago, I stood in the middle of our small family cemetery, surrounded by the headstones of my ancestors. My grandparents are buried there, my great-grandparents and even great-great grandparents.

It was a strange moment- I felt I was leaving my parents in the company of the people who were a direct cause of them having existed in the first place. Those people all worked hard; (all farmers)... they'd struggled, suffered hardships, (during those years when crops failed my grandpa worked nights as a security guard after putting in a full day's work in the fields). They were *survivors*, and the fact I was even standing there amongst them was completely down to them. 

I couldn't say what I felt was pride- what I did feel was a massive sense of gratitude. If I can live my life to be the sort of person *they* would be proud of having as their descendant,  then perhaps I've not failed too badly.
