CFB,fcsub1o,t3_eipybr,1577925291.0,What a shitty spot.
JoeRogan,fcsb20s,t1_fcs0wj3,1577914038.0,I agree. Iâ€™m just saying that it would not be hard to believe if there were another conflict happening.
JoeRogan,fcrx9v9,t1_fcrx195,1577907887.0,"Only history in stories. While fun to hear, they donâ€™t exactly paint him as the best person."
CFB,fcrr2vn,t1_fcrnxqa,1577905472.0,I donâ€™t see that working well. Seems like too much of a nancy for the NFL

movies,fckxytk,t1_fckwv3l,1577735593.0,Iâ€™d say itâ€™s more appropriate to watch for middle school ages. Hopefully they are watching it. Iâ€™d say itâ€™s more like Barney than Sesame Street
nfl,fcj4t57,t1_fcj42xv,1577677285.0,Doesnâ€™t matter if he canâ€™t call plays. Baker canâ€™t play past 1 read when heâ€™s getting smashed all the time and the D can handle whatever play they throw at them.
StarWars,fcfrv08,t1_fccht5p,1577633163.0,Well thank god itâ€™s a worthy replacement. That one was my favorite. Surprised they didnâ€™t just build the new one on a addition though

StarWars,fcc0tdf,t1_fcbxufo,1577593131.0,"I havenâ€™t been or heard the specifics of the complaints but based on Harry Potter land in Islands of Adventure, I can imagine people being let down if theyâ€™re expecting a section of a park to be its own park. Without the preexisting Dueling Dragons (best ride in the park) HP feels small."
CFB,fcbum3u,t1_fcbub81,1577591152.0,Thatâ€™d be kinda cool
CFB,fcbu7fx,t3_eh0oid,1577591024.0,No one going to check if they tipped it?

CFB,fcbrxvn,t1_fcbrlp3,1577590299.0,He didnâ€™t. He was leading with his shoulder into his chest/shoulder until he ducked his head down right into the helmet.
CFB,fcbrgoa,t3_eh0oid,1577590149.0,Still wouldnâ€™t be targeting if he doesnâ€™t duck into it.
