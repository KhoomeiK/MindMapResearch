serialkillers,fekocc7,t3_epih72,1579204228.0,"I loved season one, but season two was so freaking mundane to me personally .. All of the main scenes, especially the ones featuring ""Charles Manson"" could have been done much better."

Skincare_Addiction,fegm7bx,t1_feg1yek,1579097016.0,I have the Radha large bottle of rosehip oil & then I have a smaller sample size bottle that I refill with it. I keep the smaller bottle in my bathroom & the larger bottle in the fridge to preserve it as long as possible.
Advice,feglqzg,t1_feeib1s,1579096655.0,"Yeah, especially when you thought the evening/event went well, and then you hear they're running their mouths a couple of days later! Being upset is natural. If it comes down to it, I would discuss it with your girlfriend prior to confronting the family. Maybe she would know a way to ease the tension?

Good luck!"
Advice,feef8b6,t3_eonnmg,1579032533.0,"The good thing here, is that you're willing to change. I would start making a ""goals"" list weekly, and make sure I accomplish those goals. Physically write the goals down on a note pad and cross them out as you complete each one. The goals could be anything from completing ALL homework, cleaning bedroom & bathroom, help parent or guardian cook dinner, apply to jobs, etc. If you can keep adding a goal or two each week, you'll be set!"
Advice,feeepit,t3_eoo32p,1579032220.0,If you're 20 years old why does he all of the sudden need your social security #? Sounds shady to me!
Advice,feeeh9i,t3_eone6h,1579032086.0,"I would do my best to ignore it, even though that can be SUPER difficult. Some people just aren't happy unless they're talking about others. It sounds like that's just how they are. I would also be pretty upset about it, but you can't teach an old dog new tricks. If it starts to get out of hand, however, I would definitely say something to all of them. I would do it in a non-aggressive way of course, but direct enough to get the point across. 

Also, I love the name ""gossip factory""."
Advice,feee3fv,t3_eop12k,1579031860.0,"I would talk to him with your family and a professional present. If you try to push him into leaving her, it may make him want to stay that much more. If a professional can explain the toxicity of this relationship to him, he may be more prone to listen to them. 

Good luck! I hope everything works out for your brother & your family."
Skincare_Addiction,feed93e,t3_eoge29,1579031365.0,"The Ordinary has some products that have been very effective for me. I use the Nyacinamide & Zinc serum in the morning and evening. I also use the Salicylic Acid 2% serum in the evening, however, this is often sold out in the Ordinary's brand. I found a comparable option from Amazon (let me know if you'd like the link), that is also effective for me. I also use the Lactic Acid at night a 2-3 times a week under the salicylic & nyacinamide serums. You have to apply one, let soak into your skin for 5-10 minutes, then apply the next. I know this seems time consuming, but I just brush teeth/make my morning coffee/feed my pets, etc in between applications. Also - once a week I use the AHA/BHA peel by the Ordinary. This is a red ""mask"" that you put on, wait for ten minutes, then wash off. This has helped me with my scarring/hyperpigmentation. If you decide to use this product, I would recommend doing 5 minutes the first week, six the second, etc until you get up to 10 minutes once per week. Only because this product is so strong.

I also recently began taking Zinc supplements that I believe also help my skin. I read several articles that stated if you're low in zinc you're more prone to acne. Not sure if this is 100% accurate, but the zinc supplements I take can also be found on Amazon. Let me know if you'd like the link to that as well! 

I've had a TIME with acne since I was about 15, and am now 29 years old (and still get some breakouts from time to time!), so I've been through it all! Let me know if you need any other suggestions! I am more than happy to help!"
Skincare_Addiction,feeca2u,t3_eofxcq,1579030797.0,I love the AHA/BHA peel from The Ordinary. Its very affordable and effective.
Skincare_Addiction,fee7w8s,t3_eooi13,1579028225.0,"After all this time, I finally realized how badly my skin reacts to alcohol. My husband & I were drinking a lot of redbull vodkas, vodka sodas, fireball, etc. I also drank wine sometimes during the week, but I noticed that when I only drink a glass or two, my skin doesn't react as badly as it does to liquor drinks. After a year or so of partying several nights a week, I decided to do the ""Dry January"" thing. I'm only 14 days in and can already tell a HUGE difference in my skin. The bags under my eyes are basically non-existent, and I only have ONE (mayyyybeeee two) bump on my skin! The previous acne scars I had are already starting to clear up, and my skin looks MUCH more hydrated already. I've also been drinking more teas during the day at work, as well as in the evening. I have a detox tea, a stress relief tea, and a couple of flavored non-caffeinated teas. I think these help me in not drinking in the evenings because I still have something yummy to drink that isn't plain water.  

After ""dry January"", I plan on drinking alcohol again, but this time in moderation. I won't drink during the week, and on the weekend I will stay away from liquor, unless its a special occasion. I'll probably only have a couple of glasses of wine on Fridays/Saturdays. 

Hopefully drinking lots of water helps you out! You could also try a good detoxifying facial mask, which could help as well. Also - a good moisturizer to keep the acne bumps from scarring!"
Skincare_Addiction,fee6ehp,t3_eop9v1,1579027349.0,"I have Radha's rosehip oil and don't get the rancid odor. It may have gone bad, but I'm not too positive if that type of product goes bad. When did you purchase this?"
Skincare_Addiction,fee68cf,t3_eonjvf,1579027248.0,"Are you breaking out in areas you normally don't break out? If so, I wouldn't call this purging & would recommend stopping what you believe made you break out for a couple of weeks to see if your skin settles. 

Are you using The Ordinary's lactic acid? I love the Ordinary's products. Their salicylic acid 2% solution is fantastic, but constantly sold out. I also love their AHA/BHA peel mask."

Skincare_Addiction,fdnzzjl,t3_em4n4d,1578596293.0,"I use Aveeno Sheer Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30. This is the ONLY moisturizer that I can use that doesn't break me out, and its very wallet friendly. At night when my skin is extra dry I use Aveeno Overnight Hydrating Facial Moisturizer. I also have very acne prone skin, and I check ALL of the products I use on my face on the website [www.cosdna.com](https://www.cosdna.com)

This website breaks down ALL of the ingredients in each and every product you use. I don't use anything that has an Acne or Irritant rating over 1 or 2.

Advice,fco8y5f,t1_fcnkfcl,1577826437.0,"Thanks! I’m looking forward to it. I think the acne is just from hormones, and maybe the alcohol is affecting them. My husband is proud of me for the decision, and I look forward to tomorrow! Happy new year!!!"
