Who says ""no one thinks that way?"" You just said you did, so obviously *someone* does, which makes him wrong. He's just trying to mess with your head and play with your insecurity."
latebloomerlesbians,fgdsb3y,t3_exx27k,1580686298.0,"This is a man who pins his self-worth on the subjugation of women, as seen by him calling you sexist for stating you find women prettier. Your existence hurts his feelings because being unable to subdue you is a hit to his perceived manliness. He's trying to make you feel bad about yourself so he can feel like he has the upper hand. Don't let him. <3

Edit: report his message, too."
latebloomerlesbians,fgdpyw3,t1_fgdmny7,1580685277.0,"Thank you so much. It means a lot to have some compassion right now. I never expected my mom to be happy about my coming out, but she could have laid off for the time being."

Thanks for the advice. Sounds like it should be fine."
boottoobig,fgavfvj,t1_fgas6ak,1580655835.0,The original article had it censored the exact same way. Maybe that's why.
YouShouldKnow,fg88xob,t1_fg87c6b,1580612709.0,"The gist of my comment was not that I thought a 3 year old should have to sit on a flight between two strangers. That just makes for a terrified child which would make everyone's life hell. 

The gist was that he 100% could have chosen his seats beforehand. I've chosen my seat on every flight I've ever taken, because it was important to me where I sat so I chose wisely. He didn't do that and then when other people didn't want to move for him he acted like those people were assholes. Why in the hell would you not make absolutely sure you're seated with your three year old when buying tickets?!"
YouShouldKnow,fg86zsj,t1_fg86uec,1580611188.0,You just said that to me on another comment. And that's not what I said. Read the rest of the thread.

YouShouldKnow,fg7yqu8,t1_fg7xenv,1580604929.0,"You are making a massive amount of assumptions about me. First, at no point did I say that I think a toddler should fly sitting between two strangers. That would be asinine, for all the reasons you listed.

Second, I cannot be a father as I am a woman. Third, I cannot make a child, as I am barren. But one day I will have foster kids/ adopted kids. And having flown a lot in the past, I know how airlines treat people like cattle and you can bet your ass I won't be trusting the airline to have the wellbeing of my kids at the top of their priority list and I'll just pay for seats ahead of time to make absolutely sure that my kids stay with me."
YouShouldKnow,fg7wwk2,t1_fg7wcn5,1580603550.0,"I entitled my ass to sit in a specific seat by paying an extra $30 for it. 

Airlines can follow federal law at the same time. These things are not mutually exclusive."
YouShouldKnow,fg7w7iu,t1_fg7stk1,1580603036.0,"I've seen lots of flights where you can pick adjacent seats together. For free, even. And when I couldn't find adjacent seats on one flight, I found some on a flight a few hours later. 

Now, picking free seats for you and the kiddo will probably mean you sit in an aisle and middle seat, which isn't very fun. But hey... it's free and you're together."
YouShouldKnow,fg7v7hq,t1_fg7rxc6,1580602286.0,"Well, it's obvious airlines are gaming the system. Just look at them. Lol. And I'm not disagreeing that a child should be able to sit together with at least one parent. That's obvious. No one wants a two year old sitting by themselves between a couple of strangers. 

The problem I have is where that law crosses my rights as an equally paying customer. I pay for a window seat every single flight (I get motion sickness if I cant at least crack the window) and I've been treated like a jerk for not moving when I know for a fact that the family could have picked free (crappy) seats beforehand, but were banking on bullying a stranger to move so little Timmy could look out of the window on his first flight."
YouShouldKnow,fg7r2hh,t1_fg7q4c3,1580599331.0,"I am entitled to a seat I paid an extra $30 to sit in. Refusing to move does not make me a douche. It makes me a person on a work trip who needs to arrive at my destination without the headache and nausea of motion sickness so I can get work done. 

You need to sit with your toddler, you need to ensure that you will, so therefore you need to spend the money to make sure that you do. I'm aware that flying with children sucks. Trust me, I've seen many families on flights and I'm aware of what it entails. But if you paid the bare minimum, your family status does not grant you special benefits. If you want to sit together, do what everyone else has to do. Buy. Your. Seats."

YouShouldKnow,fg7q4yf,t1_fg7p8sk,1580598666.0,I'm sure it sucks and I would probably hate it more than I hate flying. That's why I buy window seats with airlines who let me do that and politely decline to move when asked.
YouShouldKnow,fg7pi8x,t1_fg7oja7,1580598221.0,"I said nothing about your generalization about Americans so I don't know what your first line means. 

To the second part, it's the airline's responsibility to get you and your child from A to B alone and intact. They are not responsible for your child's emotional wellbeing by being close to you on an airplane. That's your job and you didn't do it."
YouShouldKnow,fg7nsse,t1_fg7lzn9,1580597024.0,"No I don't, but if I did I would have the foresight to consider seating on the plane and wouldn't presume to be able to push strangers around for my benefit when I got there."
YouShouldKnow,fg7ngzj,t1_fg7ms3a,1580596792.0,"Get whooshed much?

My point is that if you want nice things you have to pay for them and that it's a dick move to use your ""but I have a baby"" status to push strangers around on airplanes."
YouShouldKnow,fg7kigt,t1_fg7b1zr,1580594727.0,"They are not hostesses, they are flight attendants. Their job is to ensure your safety during the flight, not your comfort and that you get the seats you want."
YouShouldKnow,fg7k2ma,t1_fg7gr5g,1580594421.0,"Yeah they have the choice. To fly an airline where they can pay for seating to make sure they all sit together without infringing on the rights of other people. 

Families also have even cheaper options, where seating won't be as much of an issue. Like driving or taking a train or Greyhound bus."
YouShouldKnow,fg7jjd2,t1_fg7h97u,1580594051.0,"It's not ridiculous to refuse to move from a seat I paid for for a family who is trying to game the system and save money. That's great for you that you dont care which seat you're in, but I get motion sick on a plane when I can't see outside to orient myself to the ground so I always buy a window seat for myself. I don't fly for work anymore, but when I did I wouldn't have exactly been on the top of my game if I had been made to move and arrived at my work location with nausea and a splitting headache... all because a family wanted what they wanted without having to pay for it.

I dont want to be a bother for the flight crew either, but when I paid for my seat and the family of three didn't pay because they expect the generosity of strangers when they get there, I am not moving and I am not ridiculous for it."

I'm mad at myself over the amount of pain I've lived through and also caused to other people trying to make het happen. I'm sad for the life I could have had if I'd realized it when I was younger, and kinda jealous of those who have.

It's sad that these guys base their self worth on the possibility that they are desirable to any and all women, so that when faced with the existence of lesbians, they are hurt and their response is to try to knock us down to make themselves feel better.

latebloomerlesbians,fdp2y0x,t3_emh8uo,1578618744.0,"I got mislabeled at a party on New Year's Eve. In the basement were me, another woman, and three other guys and we were having a hilarious convo on pubic hair maintenance. One of the guys addressed the other woman and I and started to ask, ""so as women, do you like it when...""

And I interrupted him saying ""hmm mmm, am lesbian.""

His confusion was so strong he stopped asking the question and just went, ""REALLY?!"" at me.

Nine days later and I still don't know exactly what that meant. Why so surprised?"
