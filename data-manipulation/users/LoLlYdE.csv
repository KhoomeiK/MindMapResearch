> Non-operative treatment is both safe and effective for the majority of patients with gender dysphoria.

For this majority, any trans related surgery would be elective/optional. However there are cases (any trans person that doesnt fall under this ""majority"") where the surgery is *necessary*, as their quality of life is reduced drastically, if the "" effective"" means ""effective enough for the surgery to not be necessary"", wich is unclear in this case."

Highly disagree, but they arent immediately necessary. Definitely not worth the increased risk.

2Booty,fdpzub0,t1_fdpyh71,1578647862.0,"Basically, using the word trap carries the idea that the person it is being used for is in some way insincere or lying to achieve what they want. Usually it's implied that the person is lying about being a woman to ""trick"" straight men into sex, wich juuust so happens to be the base to the so called ""(trans/gay) panic defense"", wich claims that someone ""acted in a state of violentÂ temporary insanity, committingÂ assaultÂ orÂ murder, because of unwanted same-sex sexual advances"" (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense) wich gets used to either lessen the sentence from hatecrime to something minor or even be judged as innocent, wich I hopefully dont have to explain why its bad.

So, basically, not only does the word trap get abused to make false claims about trans women, but the idea it carries is also the foundation to use systematic transphobia to commit crimes against trans people (mostly women but sometimes men too) in a government wich doesnt protect them against it

Also for fairness sake, it gets used for actual crossdressers too, wich..I suppose is *fine*? Bit of a grey area imo because a lot of times, trans women get thrown in a pot with crossdressers, wich are completely different things.

If you've any question dont be afraid to ask, gotta learn something before you know it right?"

2Booty,fdiloma,t1_fdidz2t,1578445687.0,"Imagine legitimately thinking that having sex with a woman as a man is gay

Also, ""trap"" is a slur that gets used as (and normalizes the idea of) an excuse for violence against trans women, and perpetuates the idea that trans women are in any way deceitful or have ill intentions. Yes, this also goes when using that word for fictional characters, as there is usually made no distinction between crossdressers (men who present feminine with the appropriate clothes) and trans women"

Let me break it down for you

""Wearing skirts as a boy"" viewed as a bad thing: toxic masculinity

Also sexist, see OP

Also ever so slightly touching upon transphobia

""considered gay and looked down upon"" gay = bad is homophobia (the fact that I even have to explain this goddamn)"
