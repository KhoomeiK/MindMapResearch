AskReddit,ff2zgfa,t3_erc1ft,1579529506.0,"“When you [talk about how you’re feeling] it makes me feel [frustrated because I can’t help you]. I think you need more support than I can give you, and I think we should look for outside help.”

Avoid setting any blame on them, and let them know that of course you want to help, but when there’s nothing you can do it can be frustrating and can get you down too. 

Suggesting that “we” look at getting helps tells them that you’re still there for them and want to help in a different way. It’s not easy, but I wish you the best of luck. 

Also don’t forget about yourself - supporting anyone long term will have a knock on effect on you, so if you’re also able to seek outside help it will help you both."

fatlogic,femkma7,t1_femjyjl,1579260289.0,"I totally appreciate that help can be hard to come by. I can’t afford private help so I had to wait 12 months for a healthcare referral. 

Have a look online for online counselling if there is nothing available for you locally that’s accessible (either financially or even socially - I’m lucky that I could tell my friends and family that I was seeking help, but I know in some places and cultures that’s still very much not acceptable). It’s easier to hide/disguise an online chat that an in-person appointment.

I know in the UK there are websites like qwell.io , kooth, BetterHelp which all have professional counsellors available. Some offer a free service with enhanced paid for features. Search online and see if there is anything like that, because I really really think you should speak to someone. I know to you it doesn’t feel that bad, but as an outsider looking in it seems to me like you could benefit from professional support. 

Please try and seek help. 500 calories a day does not seem healthy, and some of your thought processes surrounding your weight seem quite worrying to me. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from my support, it’s that having those kind of strict rules can be so damaging if you aren’t able to work some flexibility in (different rules for me, but I had to deal with that same sort of inflexibility which was damaging me). I didn’t even realise how much damage I was doing until I started trying to challenge them. 

I wish you all the best!"
fatlogic,femjnrv,t1_femitr4,1579258984.0,"I’m just a stranger on the internet with no medical qualifications, but it does sound to me as though there are some conflicting thoughts here. You start by saying your BMI is underweight, but later you consider yourself “maybe a little too fat”. 

Cancelling social engagements once or twice because you’re not feeling your best is normal IMO, but cancelling “a lot” of engagements because you feel fat (despite an underweight BMI) and feeling “unworthy” suggests that there is something more at play here. 

I know you’ve said that you feel fine mentally, and I want to touch on that a sec. I’m not saying that my situation is anything like yours, and I won’t claim to know your circumstances, but before I started therapy I would have said the same. I felt fine - I didn’t feel like I needed help, I was just a little tired and had a bit too much on my plate (literally and metaphorically). 

Now I’m getting help for various issues including depression, anxiety, and deeply-rooted issues regarding perceived self-worth, all of which have had powerful consequences. It’s crazy how much you can internalise and accept, and how something that seems like a normal thought for you can seem completely alien to someone else. For example and to use your comment: to me, feeling like I have to hit a target weight in order to pass an exam seems disordered. Your weight does not directly affect your intelligence. 

(However, I totally agree it can have a massive indirect influence; if you don’t feel comfortable, your physical and mental energy can be drained by those negative thoughts, which leads to poorer performance. Freeing up mental space by removing the negative thoughts associated with feeling overweight might make you study better, recall information better, perform better etc., but being skinny will not in and of itself make you smarter.)

From what I know, anorexia isn’t just a threshold of weight or calories. Not every AN sufferer will have that same 500 calorie threshold (which seems dangerously low to me if that is your net calorie consumption on a daily basis). 

You mention that you fit the criteria for AN (B/P sub) - have you ever talked to anyone about this, like your GP, an ED consultant, or a therapist? Even if you don’t feel like it’s the right label at this point in time, I think it could help you to talk around the subject with a professional (because I am only a stranger on the internet - I cannot help you, as much as I wish that I could)."
fatlogic,femhxlm,t1_felz85u,1579256466.0,"I’m probably the worst person to ask (aside from not being a medical professional or even remotely educated on EDs other than what I know from my friend and some stuff I’ve read online which is Absolutely True and Not At All False or Biased).

Personally I don’t think that I’ve ever had a good relationship with food. I know that I stress eat, and I seem to have a strange association that eating helps me concentrate so I’m a near-constant grazer (I feel more productive when I have something to munch on - probably not true at all). I have to have food nearby or I’ll get really uncomfortable, like what if I get hungry in the next 20 minutes and I don’t have something easily accessible? Whenever I try and adjust my diet to factor in more healthy options, I always go ‘all or nothing’ on restrictions and then end up binging and hating myself for it.

Personally I would say that disordered eating would be any eating behaviour that has a negative impact on your life, however I would caveat that with degrees of severity and would say that not all disordered eating behaviour needs to be labelled as an Eating Disorder - because I don’t think we should be diluting what ‘Eating Disorder’ stands for and the risks associated with the more dangerous conditions.

To use myself as an example: I don’t think it would be helpful at all for my doctor to tell me I have an Eating Disorder. It’s far more productive to try and reach the underlying issues of ~why~ I have these thoughts (food = control, lack of money in childhood meant lack of food in childhood, no confidence in abilities to prepare food so reliant on ‘junk’ or ‘easy/convenient’ food etc.) and work on trying to challenge, manage or maybe even break those thought cycles and habits. This is something that I am working on with professional help (although it’s not the reason why I sought help in the first place, and I wish I’d known years ago that it was okay to ask for help with stuff like this).

I’m lucky that I seem to be sitting with a great doctor at the moment. We have a lot of shared experiences around our weight and history, and she actually listened when I mentioned about my childhood. It wasn’t called HAES back then, but I grew up with a lot of the “All the women in our family are bigger” “You’re just big-boned” “BMI doesn’t count for everyone” mentality, and it was nice to hear her acknowledge that it’s something that does get inside your head, which isn’t my fault, and that I’ve had to break myself out of to accept that it really is all down to me, which is a first step that a lot of these HAES supporters don’t seem to be taking IMO.

Can I ask why you’ve started identifying with ED recently? You mention later in your comment that you have no mental problems and you can stop when you want to, but I know that when I binge it feels like this unstoppable force like I’ve lost all control."
loseweight,fekqcwa,t1_fekou05,1579205428.0,"Depends on how you want to approach it. One the one hand, you can eat anything you want and lose weight - provided you eat it in the right amounts. This why tracking what you eat is so important - you can still eat biscuits and chocolates and snacks, you're just going to get less bang for your buck in terms of portion size vs calorie consumption.

Try to increase your protein. Chicken and fish are great and often inexpensive, depending on where you live, and you can cook them in a variety of ways. A trainer I had a while back recommended using protein shakes instead of snacks (but avoid most pre-mixed protein shakes, and definitely avoid protein bars which are mostly carbs with a slightly-higher-than-average protein content) because protein will help you feel fuller for longer, but protein shakes (especially made with water) contain very few calories.

Try reducing your carbohydrate intake, which is easier said than done. I find it very difficult to completely avoid pasta, bread, rice, noodles, chips etc. so I try and reduce how often I have them and reduce the size of the portion.

I would search online for high protein meals for weight loss. Bonus if they give you the calorie content that you can then track.

(As an aside, if you're interested: my current doctor has recommend that I take a look at the Blood Sugar diet - it's all about reducing and managing carbohydrates in order to better regulate insulin release. Apparently it's really great for helping with weight loss. Haven't tried it yet, got some books on order from Amazon, so I can't tell you whether it does work or whether it will be suitable for you, but there is a Blood Sugar diet recipe book which seems to focus around high protein, low carb, low calorie meals.)

At the end of the day, the most important thing is to consume less than you exert (to eat less than you burn). Track your intake honestly and accurately - nobody is judging what you're eating. You don't have to share it with anyone if you don't want to, but you have to make sure it's accurate. Bring your calorie consumption down, bring your exercise levels up, and accept that it's a journey. You're not going to see change overnight and it's not going to happen (at least not sustainably) from one single action. Successful, sustainable weight loss comes from the sum of lots of little actions done consistently."

loseweight,feje55c,t3_epgahe,1579169649.0,"Not a personal trainer or any kind of expert, but here are my tips:

Track your food honestly for a couple of weeks. Use an app like MyFitnessPal to keep a record of what you’re currently eating to get yourself a benchmark. It’s better (IMO) to overestimate than underestimate here - so if you search for a food and get different results, lean towards the one with the higher calories. 

This phase sucks every time I do it, because it forces me to face up to just how much I’m eating. It might be difficult, but try to take away any sense of judgement. It’s just food. It’s not good, or bad, and you’re not a good or bad person for eating it. 

While you’re logging food to set your starting intake, look for a TDEE calculator. The one on MyProtein seems fairly good IIRC. TDEE is the total amount of calories you need to stay at your current weight. 

You need to create a deficit of 3,500 calories to lose 1lb fat. If you aim to lose:

 1lb a week that’s your TDEE - 500 calories per day. 

2lbs a week and it’s your TDEE - 1,000 calories per day. 

The trainers that I’ve worked with in the past don’t recommend trying to lose more than 2lbs a week. Every body is different, so you might find that you lose more or less than that, but I’ve been told that if you try and reduce your calories too much it can have the opposite effect and could cause metabolic damage. Your body could end up fighting you to retain fat because it’s trying to protect you from starvation. 

Try and move more. I try and focus on two types of movement: intentional exercise and incidental exercise. 

Intentional exercise includes the gym, workout classes, going out specifically to go for a walk. Anything that I do specifically for the purposes of exercise I class as intentional. 

Incidental exercise is stuff I can do alongside other stuff. Getting up and walking to a different bathroom at work (extra steps). Taking the stairs instead of the lift. Walking to corner shop B because it’s a little bit further than corner shop A. Even housework can be incidental exercise. I take my time doing the hoovering/vacuuming and do more than I need to so I can burn a few extra calories. I do my laundry load by load (instead of all at once) so I can walk back and forth between the machines and the bedroom every time I have to load and unload. 

The basic premise of any successful weight loss is to eat less and move more. In terms of what you should be eating - it will depend. As a general note, I find that protein makes me feel fuller for longer and is better for my body, so I try to eat more of it. I also look at the calorific density of foods (kind of like calories per gram). Chocolate, biscuits, snack foods are often very calories dense, whereas grapes, cherry tomatoes, and fruits have a low calorie density - meaning you can eat a lot more of them for the same amount of calories. Trying to bring in low calorie density foods for my snacks helps with my grazing habits between meals. 

Hope this helps and good luck!"

fatlogic,fejcs5i,t1_fej3j30,1579167582.0,"I personally feel like there has been a trend in recent years to broaden the horizons of what an eating disorder is (along with a general trend in the West at least to broaden opinions and discussions surrounding mental health). A few years ago the only EDs I knew about were anorexia and bulimia, and EDNOS only because a friend was diagnosed with it. 

As someone who struggles with my relationship with food, I accept that I have disordered eating - but I would not class myself as having an eating disorder. 

I accept that disordered eating is important and needs to be recognised, and yes it’s not just for skinny people (Binge Eating Disorder really does a number on you, amongst others), but I think the attempts to classify any kind of disordered eating as an Actual Eating Disorder muddies the water and does more to hurt people with more severe EDs. 

But like any ED or mental health issue, it takes time and effort to try and assess, manage or even attempt to resolve the disordered thinking and the underlying issues. Going to a therapist, getting your “label” and then not accepting or being receptive to treatment seems like such a vanity move to gather another “I’m overweight because...” feather in your cap. It’s easier to blame the label than it is to recognise your own disordered thinking and habits."
fatlogic,fejcg5j,t1_fej66s8,1579167074.0,"As a native English speaker (UK) using the term “fire” for a client is something that I’ve come across fairly recently. My understanding, at least in the circles that I move in, is that up until recently it’s been almost seen as more professional to refer to getting rid of a client in a more eloquent way (discontinued the relationship, no longer working with, withdrew from the relationship). 

Not sure if the current trend of referring to this as firing your client is reflective of the kind of “dons-with-the-bullshit” mentality that seems to be growing, where people are starting to “call a spade a spade” (calling something for what it is, rather than trying to be over eloquent about it). 

Not sure if this is a British Thing, or maybe just specific to the people and businesses (and business people) that I know, but thought I’d share in case you were interested."
videos,fef5c6u,t1_feeq0ql,1579048543.0,"When I read the article linked above, the guest had time before the podcast in which he weighed up the pros and cons of weighing in on such a difficult decision (whether to buck the trend or go with the flow). He put time and effort in to making sure that he was emotionally ready to have that discussion and put himself out there. Given how he presents his experience in the article, I imagine he may have been less successful if he’d found out, in the middle of the recording, about the game he was reviewing and when the cast would be released. 

I expect by the reaction in the video that he was not aware of this story beforehand and it completely caught him for a loop. Messed up your stories are one thing, but a flat out confession of rape is something that would (and should) throw you for a loop - especially when you factor in the panic of “oh crap, reputational damage” (I don’t listen so don’t know what the reputation of this cast is, but any business person should always have one eye on “the brand”). 

Fair play to him for calling a spade a spade and for calling Brad out on it when he tried to play it off, especially in the heat of the moment."
weightlossdiets,feeriub,t1_feebrar,1579039669.0,"From seeing a tattoo artist speaking about this on YouTube, it varies a lot depending mostly on you and your skin, but also on the placement of the tattoos. There are certain spots where your skin tends to grow from - I think from memory it’s normally the back of things, like the backs of your arms and legs. When your skin “shrinks” after losing weight or muscle mass in the area, the skin is kind of pulled back towards that point. 

IIRC the point of growth can vary from person, and each person’s skin is different. Unfortunately it seems like the only way to know for certain is to go through the change, but you might be able to get some guidance or advice from a professional tattoo artist."

KingdomHearts,fdg9she,t1_fdfzi65,1578386232.0,"On the one hand I totally agree with you. She has no experience in the field, and even if we assume she has some experience sparring with Axel then that’s still one-on-one with an opponent who probably isn’t going to go all out on her. She was never going to be as strong as any of the other guardians on that front and I’m okay with that. 

My issue is the way they set it all up. I neither expected nor wanted Kairi to be another Aqua or another Xion. That would never have been realistic. Aqua trained for years to become a Master, and Xion had Sora’s memories plus her own experience. 

But don’t send her to “a place where time doesn’t matter” and then not have her coming out with at least something special on the fighting side. She was barely competent as AI in the Skein of Severance, and in my game spent more time KO’d than actually doing anything. 

For me, the frustrating thing is that she spent we don’t know how long in a magical time chamber where she could take as long as she needed to get ready, and she still wasn’t ready. Which suggests a lack of competence either for her or in Merlin (who is not a keyboard wielder - he’s a magician. I know Yen Sid retired or whatever, but when the fate of the world is at stake and there are literally no Keyblade Masters left in the realm of light, you’d think that you’d at least pop by every once in a while to check in and give some pointers).

I have no problem with Kairi not being as strong as the others in KHIII, I just wish they’d set it up differently. 

Take away the time chamber. Make it a race against time, and there isn’t enough of it for how far she needs to go. Have that scene on the tree be more about Kairi saying she wished she had more time, but that she’ll do everything she can to help. 

For me that would have made her failure that much more heartbreaking to me - to see a character who has done everything within her power to try and be as strong and capable as she needs to be and it still wasn’t enough.

As much as I am hype for playable Kairi in the DLC, I worry that they’re going to go the other way. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t enjoy getting my arse kicked by a video game, but to have her now going toe to toe with who I assume is Xehanort with only Sora as her support seems at this stage to be a bit of an over correction as far as the story is concerned (but I will absolutely play the shit out of it and I hope to thoroughly enjoy it)."

sweatystartup,fdc6b29,t3_ejhxrm,1578267951.0,"Here's is what I'm working on and have got planned for my off-season (October to late March):

* Paperwork and Admin. It sucks but I know I won't have time to do it in the summer. Not only am I making my way through the backlog of receipts, payments, emails and everything else that's piled up while I've been out 'in the field', I'm also seeing what I can learn from this summer. Are there ways I can optimise my time or make it easier to do tasks on-the-go?  I'm looking at cloud accounting software and whether I can automate any of my manual processes. I'm trying to set the groundwork now so I don't end up in this exact same position this time next year.
* Planning and strategy. I love that my off-season overlaps the end of one calendar year and the start of another. It gives me time to look back at what went well (or didn't) and assess it, and then working on setting the foundations for the new year. This could include looking back over events that I've missed, checking out any organsations who hosted events last year (contact them: ""I see that you hosted xxx in 2019 and was wondering if you had any events planned for 2020...)
* Self-care is key during the winter months! I'm currently trying to work in some healthier habits that I can try and make stick  before summer kicks back in again, but I'm also clearing down my mental to-do list, trying to get rid of non-business things that have been stressing me out or that I couldn't do during the summer (tidying the house, sorting the car, catching up with friends). With businesses like ours where it's feast or famine in the summer vs the winter, it's so easy to burn yourself out - take advantage of the slower months to take care of your business.

And, as someone else has said, start a winter gig. It's probably too late to do all that much with it for this year, but definitely start shopping around and taking stock of opportunities. I saw someone mentioned a regular indoor gig if you could find the venue - maybe get in touch and lay the groundwork for 2020/21 winter now. Maybe offer to arrange a few 'test-run' events with them to see if it works. 

I would personally imagine that with something like a bounce-house you'd probably go down really well if you could create an indoor family event that parents can take bored kids to (especially if you're able to find somewhere that doesn't have a lot of options for younger kids), so maybe see if you can network with face painters or artisans and craft stalls or children's entertainers and town halls/rec centres/empty school halls/church halls and see if you can liven up a dreary Sunday afternoon somewhere.

Best of luck!"
AskReddit,fcu3hxr,t3_eiwedy,1577971492.0,"IIRC I believe (according to an article on the internet somewhere, so pinches of salt at the ready) that this phrase was originally targeted towards those with too much wealth. ""Money won't buy happiness"" was originally supposed to mean something like if all you have left to seek is happiness, then money isn't going to help you, so you were just as well to give it away to someone who needed it. Then like most things it got twisted over time and began to target a new audience - looking at those who didn't have enough (""money won't solve your problems"").

If someone can prove/disprove it I'm all ears a sit's something I've 'known' for a while now, so I'd like to know if it's correct or not.

Personally, no, I don't believe that money can buy true satisfied-with-my-life, wouldn't-change-a-thing happiness. However, I do believe that money can take away some of the pressures and constraints that stop me from seeking happiness. If I had more money I would work less and use my free time to enjoy hobbies or learn new skills that would then bring me happiness."
