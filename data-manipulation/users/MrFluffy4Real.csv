Polarfitness,ff9bzl3,t1_ff91v67,1579709503.0,"Your slow is almost as fast as my race pace for half marathon distance. Your slow pace looks to be way too fast for your aerobic level.

I keep my heart rate at around 135-145 bpm going at around 6:45/km average which is pretty much maximum aerobic threshold for me, a slow run I’m adding 2 minutes to that."
Polarfitness,ff91lr1,t3_esamil,1579702571.0,"I would bet that it’s a matter of slowing down and building base aerobic fitness.

I run a lot and have had a month off over Christmas, started up again last week and my HR is hitting 130 at a brisk walk."
Polarfitness,ff8rg38,t3_esamil,1579693100.0,"Have you used a HRM before?

Could it be that your aerobic fitness is not as you expected?"
veganbodybuilding,ff8pkzc,t1_ff8dnfo,1579690555.0,"Protein combining has been debunked. Pretty much as long as you are getting the calories you need from a variety of food sources then you don’t need to worry about it.

“Protein combining (or protein complementing) is a dietary theory for protein nutrition that purports to optimize the biological value of protein intake. According to the theory, vegetarian and vegan diets may provide an insufficient amount of some essential amino acids, making protein combining with multiple foods necessary to obtain a complete protein. The terms complete and incomplete are outdated in relation to plant protein. The position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is that protein from a variety of plant foods eaten during the course of a day supplies enough of all essential amino acids when caloric requirements are met.[1]”"

No tofu, seitan, or anything like that.

I do pea, oat or brown rice protein. I make my own tofu and seitan out of chickpeas."
