Chromium is not Chrome.

Chromium is a light weight, open source engine of Chrome that anyone can build off of.

The new Edge is not the same as Chromium is on Ubuntu machines, or the same as Chrome

I can actually prove this too because you can't install the new Edge on a Pi, nor can you install Chrome on a Pi but you can install Chromium. 

End debate notes, this isn't what starves innovation, this is what improves innovation when tech is shared in a way that allows individuals to build off of it to make something new.

funny,ff23pd8,t1_ff22yu2,1579492955.0,"It's a Philosophical argument mate. Much like anything related to God you have to take it all with a grain of sand and look for bigger picture that makes more sense.   


All that's defined about God is that he's All Good, All Knowing, and All Powerful. So assuming he can see the Future isn't really out of the Realm of possibility for a Deity that has been claimed to have Created everything in 6 days. More importantly, there are verses that state God gave us Free Will.  


Thus you have to go with the Philosophical argument that either two things are Possible. The Bible lied about God being All Knowing, or God never gave us Free Will.   


But there are numerous verses discussing God knowledge of the ""potential"" future. So from that assertion we can assume that Time must not be Linear but instead a Branching Concept."

funny,ff1w3qt,t1_ff1uh15,1579487504.0,"Philosophical Argument that takes into account various problems with the concept of Omnipotence, Free Will, and Time.

Discussion is simple in it's laments form. If Time is Linear and non branching, and you have Free Will, then God can't be all Knowing. This is based on the Idea that if God is all knowing, then he would be able to see all the events of mankind happening at once. Think Dr. Manhattan, he perceives time as all at once but time is linear in that everything already set in stone.

So let's keep Time is Linear, and make it so God is All knowing, it means we have no Free Will based on the argument above.

Thus comes to the final option that my discussion was on, if time is not linear and you have Free Will and God is all Knowing. Then that would mean the future is fluid in what will happen. God knows every one of your decisions you'll ever make, but until Eve takes a bite of that Apple the future is not set in stone.

It's ultimately just a point of view that like I said can very easily be argued against."
funny,ff1v3wz,t1_ff1u97p,1579486853.0,"I mean maybe, or maybe god just has a plan specifically only for you and had to set up all the moving pieces so that you could exist just for his plan to happen, or maybe you're part of the plan for someone else, or maybe none of it matters and there is no real plan and God just a story to help teach unintelligent men/women that there are consequences when you do evil things because there's a being of all knowing that will punish you when you die.   


Or then again, there is a being of Omnipotence and he created us and gave us Free Will and is just watching to see what happens. I mean, it's no different than the Scientist of today creating ""AI"" and creating rules and just watching act within their environment without any involvement from us."

funny,ff1jxp8,t1_ff1g76x,1579480381.0,"You're looking at it at a narrow scope instead of looking at what god gave us which is Free Will.

Thus even though he is Omnipotent, his power ability to know everything falls completely on our actions. Best way to look at it is this way, in front of you is two decisions, that lead to two more decisions, that lead to two more decisions. You just now created a 2\^3 possible decision tree. You ultimately will only know one as a Man because they are your decisions and you'll never know the outcome of the others. But to god, he saw all the outcomes and the Present time is playing out what outcome actually happens.

So yes, god saw a future where Adam and Eve ate the Apple, but also saw one where they didn't. The only real issue here is that God knew that there was a chance it would happen and willingly punished us, but maybe that's because if he hadn't punished Humanity for it, something worst could have happened.

But even what I said could be argued so who knows.

A few peeps here don't seem to understand that Philosophy has argued over this very concept for a few thousand years now and this is just another idea on the debate. Fact remains is that this is just a potential Answer in a void where there is no correct answer because the concept of God may or may not exist and until we can prove the existence we can only make a assumption of his power, along with why the being allowed Adam/Eve to eat the apple.

It's pretty clear from the original statement I made that I don't fully agree with the system but that there is a system in place already. Medical Staff determined the person wasn't a priority until he was a priority. Just because you think anyone that shows the same signs should automatically get to jump the line isn't really up for debate because just showing signs doesn't automatically mean they are having a heart attack and I'm sure you and I can easily spend all day thinking of other signs that would be far more serious and should take priority over someone that may or may not be having a heart attack. I mean it is the Emergency Room, you could argue anyone that goes into that room is having an emergency and should be immediately seen but that's obviously not feasible nor practical as there just isn't enough medical staff at every hospital to deal with ever patient at once.

Seriously, people here don't seem to understand how business works. You don't sell the company to a larger company unless you are wanting to cash out, or you are about to go bankrupt."
trashy,fdskeaf,t1_fdsi962,1578704284.0,"I'm pointing out that the courts weren't shooting down the ""Mutual Combat"" defense but instead were pointing out that in this case it didn't matter because the bystander wasn't part of the ""Mutual Combat"". Also a Duel and Mutual Combat are both the same in terminology as either can result in death or just injury. You don't have to be in a Duel to the Death, but you can duel someone. 

What we are ultimately arguing here is two fronts. 

First was that in the Original Constitution that would later be Amended, showed that only Politicians could not participate in duels.

> Dueling.SEC.5.[Any citizen of this State who may here after be engaged, either directly, or indirectly, in a duel, either as principal, or accessory before the fact, shall forever be disqualified from holding any office under the Constitution and laws of this State.]*

This is important text because it strictly states the Citizens of the State can engage in dueling but you cannot run for office if you do. This is a hold over for when Alexander Hamilton had his duel. Of course this was Amended out but at no point was any laws ever written stating Dueling was against the law, just saying hey now Politicians can duel. 

The Second front is the Appellate case that was sat in front of the Iowa Supreme Court. In this case they slammed the Defense not because they say Mutual Combat isn't legal, but that the defense doesn't hold up because they killed a Bystander in their own ""Mutual Combat"". Essentially this shows that the Courts recognize this defense, but since there hasn't been a Valid use for it in the State of Iowa, there is no court case that says this isn't a true legal defense. But Constitutionally it is not illegal, and legally on the books it is not illegal. People have died in the boxing ring, and I'm sure if two gentlemen decided to dress up in Medieval Armor and fight and in their fight one dies and it happens to be in Iowa they would have a Legal Defense to argue that it was a ""Mutual Combat"" or duel. 

I've now shown my argument, my sources, and my stance on it."
trashy,fdsfvce,t1_fdsa7wb,1578701841.0,"Technically pushing an elephant into oncoming traffic would be endangering others along with the elephant. Which is what the courts are saying. Courts aren't saying that Mutual Combat is illegal, but are saying that even if this was meant to be Mutual Combat they created a reckless area in which a bystander was injured. Had no bystanders been injured, and only those in the actual duel were the only ones injured it could be argued that the system has no reason to be involved as both parties agreed. 

Fact is, though you may want to try and argue otherwise. This is a legal and valid defense in my State."
