TheBrewery,ffdf1n7,t1_ffdeadw,1579819514.0,Many people have new years resolutions to drink less beer. And everyone is a bit fat from the holidays so they feel like drinking less. And January weather is shit so no one wants to go out.

EarthPorn,ffb4bdp,t1_ffazmk0,1579751434.0,"Honestly I've found -10C often feels warmer than -3 to -6C. When it's 'warmer' lots of water is still liquid and seeps into all your gear, making it harder to stay warm.
A brisk and dry -10 to -15 is pretty easily conquered by some sweaters and a wind layer"

UpliftingNews,fepgcr7,t1_fep7gnz,1579319807.0,"There's now enough millenials with debt and no job prospects on the left coast that we might finally start to see actual compromise and cooperation in the next decade instead of blind protests. All through the 00's while Alberta was booming BC was just fuming at the environmental issues while both sides got further from the reality, that we should export oil but do it carefully and with a long term perspective."

Also look at your labeling requirements, you usually get a bit of leeway. For example you can make a 4.6% beer but legally label it as 5%. And that 4.6% beer would have 114 calories which you can legally label as 110 calories."
AskReddit,fefcl9w,t1_fedx6xl,1579053391.0,"If you survived the first week youd develop a tolerance fast. By the end of it the 12 beers would feel like six. Somewhat unfortunately, I now don't feel the first beer or 2"

todayilearned,fecrhq5,t1_fecg1l8,1578981865.0,Lol the animals totally care how old the trees are. Forest succession is an entire field of Biology relevant to many industrial and conservation interests. You're straight up uninformed.

And if it goes down, then yes you lose money. That's why It's seen as a good sign when Elon leverages to buy more stock, it shows he's betting it'll go up."
teslamotors,fdjg0w2,t1_fdjf01b,1578469211.0,He sells a small amount of stock to pay the loan down. A bank might let him be 20-50% leveraged (aka buy an extra 20-50% stock at a low interest rate).
AskReddit,fcjoouf,t1_fciw825,1577696934.0,"I think you can become desensitized to not knowing whether you're real, but it can be a deep spiritual or scientific journey. A few years ago I was smoking tons of weed and eating lots of shrooms and after hitting some lows in terms of extreme depersonalization and dissociation it took about 2 years to rebuild my acceptance of my mortality as a human."
AskReddit,fcjm60o,t1_fcipd6n,1577693439.0,"Weed increases the amount of work your heart has to do, so he careful doing it with exercise, it's definitely added stress to your vascular system. Some chronic users develop heart rhythm problems."
AskTrumpSupporters,fc7o7z9,t1_fc67zfr,1577514128.0,"The answer is that we blame both. War is hell and people are human and will make mistakes. It's not only the individuals fault when they're in a fucking war zone. But it's still partially their fault.  
  
I used to hear that the method for Iraq war trials was they would judge the soldiers based on what they thought they saw at the time. So that if a scared kid fucked up they wouldn't necessarily be jailed. Because people make mistakes when they're scared and thousands of miles from home."
AskTrumpSupporters,fc7o2ej,t1_fc67zfr,1577513990.0,"I think the truth is in between. It's kinda unreasonable to train an army to be fearless, drop them somewhere terrifying, ask them to make life or death decisions perfectly every day, all knowing that if they fuck up they might go to jail after, if they even make it home. I'm not defending war crimes obviously, but there's truth to the idea that SOME mistakes are inevitably going to happen once you deploy an army. It never goes perfectly smoothly. Because soldiers are human and will do dumb shit sometimes.  
 
So don't deploy them and there's won't be war crimes, ya know?"
