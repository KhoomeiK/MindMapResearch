I've got a 3700x @ 4.1, 1080ti, 32gb @ 3133 & installed on an SSD and it is absolutely horrendous.  I have to play on ""medium"" (there's only medium, high, and epic.... So I'm playing on low) and it is incredibly choppy, and my GPU hits 95% utilization....."
AskReddit,fe2vaxb,t3_eno5j3,1578843275.0,Futurama!  Bite my shiny metal ass!
Watchexchange,fe2srn5,t3_enoa8u,1578842427.0,"I do enjoy your watches.  I will likely pick one up but always afraid the next one will be ""the one"""
nfl,fe0569s,t3_enivmm,1578803333.0,Honestly at this point I'm going to keep thinking Titans have no chance in hell. It seems to fuel them.
aww,fdwg26e,t1_fduwl4x,1578758290.0,That's terrifying and you are amazing.  Thank you for being a positive inspiration
aww,fdua6ks,t1_fdmhyyv,1578730244.0,"Aw I feel bad I didn't see this.  I love your username.  And thank you, I'm trying to keep in mind it's temporary.  November I was in hospital for a bit after suicide attempt things have been good since but this week out of the blue I lost it.  I am sure I'll come out of it.  But sometimes I miss the peacefulness of the hospital"
nfl,fdot7xr,t3_emc8s2,1578612342.0,"Oh man my brain skipped words and some reason thought this was referencing a certain event with ""miracle"" in the name."
aww,fdmg6j9,t1_fdmfrqz,1578548808.0,"I love this picture and this exchange.  

I been inexplicably super depressed for a few days and this is nice to see.  That mutual look of shock and, ""Who are you?!"" Is great."
nfl,fdlym13,t1_fdluaf8,1578535605.0,There it is.  Nice.
AskReddit,fdll837,t1_fdljazz,1578526540.0,I like this one.
UpliftingNews,fdkjtcg,t1_fdke816,1578505153.0,Yes.  It takes a bit to get all that out of their system.
nfl,fdgvffc,t1_fdg08ln,1578409302.0,"When your team plays like Bronze best hop on and enjoy plat.


Just kidding Im not even plat."
nfl,fdeo5l2,t3_ekvica,1578343126.0,"Yeah..... It sucks but with how Saints played we deserved the loss.  Vikings deserved the win. 

On a positive note, now I can watch the playoffs and relax.  Big brain move."
nfl,fdede92,t1_fde0zdb,1578336582.0,Interesting but I kind of like the novelty of finding it in the wild.
nfl,fddxkpc,t1_fddve2v,1578326420.0,I can't stop giggling at this response/username and how prompt it was.
Parenting,fddxedy,t3_eknqoz,1578326302.0,"Hahaha. Nice!

We worked it into ours routine slowly.  Now we sing the ABC's as a timer for brushing.  Sometimes I start too fast then around M N O I realize it's not gonna go and she will close as soon as I finish so I start dragging the letters out and trying to be silly.



She glares at me.  She knows."
nfl,fdc3jvo,t1_fdc36c9,1578266409.0,"> But that’s just one.

Kinda proves my point.  2017?  Bad ref calls happen all the time.  It sucks. We've been victims of it too. Gotta keep chugging along"
Saints,fdbxanm,t1_fdbse2h,1578263387.0,Don't worry about the trolls and angry folks. We will get over it.  We lost fair and square.  GG see you next season
Saints,fdbx7o0,t1_fdbwvsn,1578263340.0,"Please go enjoy the win.  Y'all earned it fair and square, I really don't get the purpose of coming here and spouting nonsense.  You're making Viking fans look like ass, represent your base better please."
nfl,fdbwl9n,t1_fdbuw53,1578262975.0,"I don't think there's much to the ""New Orleans"" part. I think receivers like Julio and Thomas are big and physical, DB's react accordingly."
nfl,fdbvkfq,t3_ekjhjv,1578262659.0,I need Eagles or Seahawks to do something really embarrassing so this sub forgets that we lost and the Vikings are our recent playoff achilles
nfl,fdbhglk,t1_fdbfu8s,1578257463.0,Lol
nfl,fdbfizb,t3_ekg3f9,1578256861.0,My wife says Saints only do well when I'm not in room. So..... I'm in timeout. Breesus... Don't let this go in vain
