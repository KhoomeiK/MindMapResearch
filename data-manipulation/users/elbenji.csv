todayilearned,ff1y7yi,t1_ff1xukz,1579488914.0,I'm from Miami too and its 100% because a lot of them were able to use wealth from Cuba to stabilize themselves and actually take advantage of segregation to basically shove all competition out. It is not even the same world for like the marielitos

todayilearned,ff1vco7,t1_ff1v3cx,1579487007.0,Actually that makes a lot of sense. How Cuban wealth was generated was basically through this. Creating the systems amongst one another and basically taking advantage of redlining to drive everyone away and redevelop the land to your choosing using generational wealth from the mainland.

todayilearned,ff1txte,t1_ff1owzv,1579486113.0,Location matters. How was your school district. Did you grow up in a very populated neighborhood or out in the sticks? What was your family situation like? Did you have a dual parent household or at least both parents in the picture? This is what is meant by institutional.

todayilearned,ff1r9rb,t1_ff1nu7w,1579484435.0,"That was his point. Urban population density is a major factor for that.
