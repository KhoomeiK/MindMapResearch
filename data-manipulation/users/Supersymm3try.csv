AskReddit,ffqcxt7,t1_ffq2cqy,1580130734.0,"If anything’s a gateway drug its alcohol,  legal almost everywhere, something most people try and causes debilitating health problems if abused. 

It’s just most people don’t think of it as a drug because it’s socially acceptable. 

When you really consider how bad the after affects of alcohol aka the hangover, is it really that different to a comedown? Heightened anxiety, headache, feeling sick. 

Id even say the MDMA comedown, from a modest dose, is not as severe as some hangovers."
AskReddit,ffqck2o,t1_ffqblba,1580130357.0,"The difference between ket and PCP is that PCP lasts a lot, lot longer and is stimulating. So the combo of being derealised and disassociated whilst also having an excess of energy is what maybe leads to the stories.

However I’m guessing that the people you hear about used large amounts because plenty of people do PCP and just chill out.

Crack doesn’t really affect your consciousness like PCP does so unless your brain is damaged from years of crack abuse or you are ill from neglecting food etc then I don’t think crack causes this type of thing, plus it only lasts about 10 minutes so most of the time people doing crack spend all their time *doing crack*."

It’s because of the binding affinity of the different drugs at your receptor sites, buprenorphine has one of the highest affinities of all opiates so it takes a lot of a drug, or a drug with an even higher binding affinity to dislodge it, meaning you usually waste your high using normal amounts on top.
