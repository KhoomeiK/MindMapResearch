I would definitely encourage yeah, just take a gander at the book and if things resonate, could be an idea to explore the topic more. 

And unfortunately, you might never know for sure unless memories surface as you age. I went and saw a therapist who works with experiencers and is an experiencer herself, but we ultimately could only land on “probably not”. Not “definitely not” or “definitely so”, but at some point I just decided I wasn’t gonna check my body with a black light every morning or film myself at night while I slept.

Paranormal,ffxvptt,t1_ffwn2jd,1580333353.0,"That’s so scary! I believe you 100%. I will say a few things—first, it’s completely understandable if these facts are just something you like to keep in a box in your brain to stay closed, and you’d never like to open it. However, as much as anything can be “known” about the abduction phenomena, it has been well established that it runs in families. 

If you’re interested in learning more, if it bothers you, I would encourage you to contact you local MUFON director and find a therapist who works with experiencers. Yes, you’d be uncovering some trauma and admitting to a reality that isn’t exactly always positive. But most people really benefit from working through the terror and getting to a place of understanding. But again, that’s only for you to decide. 

If you’re interested in learning more but don’t want to do a deep dive into your consciousness quite yet, the book *Abduction* by Dr. John E. Mack is a good starting point. It’s not *all* bad. Also, if you do start some regressive hypnosis a silver lining might be you start unlocking some psychic abilities, so that’s pretty cool!!

bipolar,fft3bfo,t3_ev28z3,1580204829.0,"I can completely relate, I’m so sorry you had to experience that. I would encourage you to do whatever makes you most comfortable, but for me the best solution has been to disclose before we even meet in person.

In my experience, it serves two purposes: it weeds out the people for whom that kind of information will never be OK, where bipolar is just a dealbreaker, and it also reduces the impact of disclosure.

I think, or at least for me, waiting a month is a little too long. If I was on the other side, a person waiting so long to disclose that medical condition would make me think they are hiding it because it’s so serious. Disclosing it right away allows room for questions and concerns, and conveys the impression you are someone managing the condition and have incorporated it into your identity.

Also, there is no “right answer“ here, but if we’re talking about consent, a foundational part of consent is having the right information. Are we asking people to invest in something they wouldn’t invest in with the right information? In my mind that would be a breach of their consent. Like I said, there’s no correct answer here, and you also have autonomy over your own information and do not owe anyone anything.

That being said, I do think it’s better to do the disclosure very early on as opposed to waiting until both parties are emotionally invested to some extent in the relationship.

Regardless, that really really sucks. Pretty shitty of that person to not give you enough regard to even explain why, but perhaps they didn’t have the capacity to make a hard, mature decision. In that case, you’re better off and at least you found out what kind of person they were before you got too far in. But if I were in your shoes right now, I’d be really hurting, so my heart goes out to you.

Don’t take this one incident too much to heart, there’s in my experience a lot of people who are open to seeing someone with bipolar, and I’m sure you’ll find someone like that too."

It’s totally understandable to be avoidant of bringing up those traumas, I can’t imagine what you’ve been through. 

But regardless of the severity of the trauma, the only way through trauma is through it. It will not be fun or feel good, until it does. EMDR isn’t a miracle cure, but it did more for me in some aspects in one session than years of talk therapy did. I would urge you to try at least one processing session, it takes a little work to get started before you process, but I would give it a shot."

People who are repeatedly harmed or threatened harm by intimate partners cope in the way they can. It’s not your fault that you were harmed, and you did not bring it on yourself after having your stated boundaries ignored and intentionally crossed repeatedly.

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffnkt4e,t1_ffku5d9,1580067325.0,"People react to sexual trauma in all sorts of ways. Contrary to the common belief, “fight or flight” aren’t the only two responses. There are also “freeze” responses, where one’s brain effectively shuts down and is unable to take action of any kind, and “fawn” where someone defaults to accommodating their abuser or whomever is threatening them in order to resolve this situation. An example of fawning would be to give a mugger your wallet and phone and whatever other belonging they want to resolve the situation. 

These responses are informed by context and how one learned in childhood to respond to threats. They also can vary contextually—for example, a cis man might go directly to “fight” when threatened physically by someone they could reasonably fight off, but fawn when threatened by someone with a knife or gun, and then freeze when assaulted physically or inappropriately touched by a cis woman.

All of this is to say, it’s not nearly as simple as “just fight back”, as these are deeply ingrained physiological responses that take a lot of situational training to change. 

It’s also insensitive and unkind to hear about someone’s trauma and respond with what they should have or could have done differently, as that is a form of blaming the person who has received harm for being harmed—“it’s your fault because you didn’t do [x]” is the implication."
