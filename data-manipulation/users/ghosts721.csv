bipolar,fcn6m09,t3_ehohni,1577804628.0,I remember when the day after I started meds was the first day in months that I thought it was more likely I’d be alive the next week than dead. It’s an indescribable weight lifted off your body. Congrats congrats congrats. Sending so much love
bipolar,fciei25,t1_fch4gs8,1577661339.0,What’s not clear to me is the mania vs depression component- my understanding is that mdma primarily functions like an ssri which ofc is the classic trigger for mania onset. But others say it leads to depressive episodes from the comedown. Any idea what that’s about?
bipolar,fcidvjn,t1_fch3k1n,1577661080.0,"I’m actually not hypo rn, I’ve just been wanting to try it for a while and I enjoy trying new things the same way I like drinking and weed in moderation. I’m most worried about mania as mine is dysphoric and has included a few (but terrifying) psychotic elements. Thank you for recommendations!!"
