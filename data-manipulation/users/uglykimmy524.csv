Even if you're just talking about the ""Golden Age"" of arcade games, you're completely ignoring Pong, Motocross, and Space Invaders, among a plethora of others. 

Regardless, arcade games aren't the ""father of microtransactions."" Because microtransactions involve in-game currency utilized to purchase in-game goods (guns, skins, etc.). What you're actually referring to is Pay-to-Play and, considering arcades were not only a huge business in the late 70s, 80s, and 90s they also introduced masses of people to gaming that otherwise wouldn't have had an opportunity to experience it because gaming consoles weren't in every household. The popularity of arcade machines built the following that birthed the generations that circle jerk around next gen consoles today.
