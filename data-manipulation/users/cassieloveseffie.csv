It involves cancer viruses and someone having their arm burned off with a particle accelerator. 

Long story short, I thing Oswald did it, he did it alone, and he did it because he was disgusted by government black projects."

facepalm,ff2h6cd,t1_ff2giqr,1579505954.0,"No this is about the context of Trump being a noted racist. He spent 8 years harassing a black president, got sued for not renting to black people and was called out by his right hand man for being super racist.

facepalm,ff26uzt,t1_ff26eeq,1579495490.0,"You just showed you don't care about logic or making sense here.

In your other post you said I would maybe have a point if it was ""Hitler for Blacks"" so clearly the racism of Trump does matter to this conversation.

Either that or you are just saying absolutely anything to avoid admitting that racism exists. Because that is what this looks like."

The Republican party has actual white supremacists in it. Trump is actively racist. People in Maga hats are shooting and stabbing black people. That is the context here. 

If you think I am unhinged for seeing racism in that context then I have news for you."

What the fuck is wrong with you?"
facepalm,ff250je,t1_ff24d5t,1579493984.0,"You are being willfully ignorant here. 

It is obvious that the T-Shirt is about black people supporting trump. The reason they had to make that shirt is because black people tend to not support trump because he went after a black president for 8 years, target 5 innocent black men and said they should be killed, and refused to rent his properties to black people. 

This is clearly about how the President and Republican party treat black people. And these people are saying that all doesn't matter. What matters is them. 

Showing that you don't care about the struggles of black people is showing that you think they are inferior. This holds to your standards. By the definitions you are giving, this is racist. 

You have no argument here and it is obvious that you also don't care about black people too."

facepalm,ff21rrh,t1_ff0huu7,1579491476.0,"Let me walk you through this. 

Trump has been accused of being super racist by people who know him and by the public that witnessed him harass a Black president for 8 years. 

Trump tries to make T-Shirts for black people who support him, which there are clearly very few because he has been pretty openly racist. 

Some white people see this situation and decide to make it a joke about them, ignoring the struggles of people who are being oppressed by the president they support. 

Yeah, that is pretty fucking racist to me."
