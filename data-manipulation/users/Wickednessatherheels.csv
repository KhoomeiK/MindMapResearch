coolguides,ffey82y,t1_ffesdi9,1579870163.0,"I'm so sorry you and your family had to experience that. Dementia is such a horrible disease and it frightens me so much to know that it can happen to anyone. I can't imagine how hard it must be, but try not to feel guilty. You have nothing to feel guilty about. As you said yourself, you don't know what you don't know. Carers and family members bear so much emotional weight as it is in those situations. You did the best you could in an ever changing environment and that's all you can ever ask of yourself."

Keep persevering and trying different things that you think may help (mental/physical health, contraception, foreplay etc) :) x"
