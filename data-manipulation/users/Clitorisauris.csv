I go a little outside of the recipe sometimes. I added chopped onion, which I cooked at medium-high heat in about a tbsp of butter and a tbsp of sesame oil (not sure exactly, as I eyeballed it rather than measuring), as well as a little of this dumpling sauce I made: https://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/dumpling-dipping-sauce?amp=true

I also added about 2 tbsp of that dumpling sauce to the rice on top of the soy sauce; you could do like 2 tbsp of soy sauce and 2 of the dumpling sauce. I like the dumpling sauce because it adds more to it than just saltiness."
