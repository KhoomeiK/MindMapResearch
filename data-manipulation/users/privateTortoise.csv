Granted a 500 quid ford isn't what you want, need or like but it's possible to find a car in most price ranges that'll tickle your fancy in one way or another.

Get someone who is used to driving a manual to drive it and make sure it engages into reverse cleanly and doesn't accidentally go into first. Beyond that if the engine oil has been changed every 24 months maximum it is hpi clear then it looks a nice wagon. Probably garaged its entire life and just a retired persons car for shopping, previous owner never had the rear brakes fixed (see mot history) but thats more down to lack of use. It'll possibly need some new bushes as you put some regular and sensible mileage on, stick with rubber not polyurethane.
