I should’ve told him to sit down and shut his fucking mouth right away but since he was still captain at that point, I told him I’d try to get him more ice time. Made him top line for all other lines, which meant holding back a top prospect slightly. Days later Kopitar bitched again, and I had to trade him right after.
