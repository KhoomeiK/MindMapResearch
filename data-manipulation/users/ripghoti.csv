* Natural selection isn't doing its job as well as it could.
* Prosperity is higher than ever in many places, like the US, so what many people think of as problems and oppression is nothing compared to what problems and oppression of 50-100 years ago were, or in less prosperous places.
* People need an enemy, a boogyman.  Without a clear one, like another country to be at war against, they find other things to fight against, like people who don't share the same political opinions.
* People are being told that instead of trying to have a discussion with someone who has an opposing view they should belittle them, berate them, scream that they are wrong, accuse them of anything that will lessen their argument no matter how outrageous or wrong it is, try to ruin their lives, etc..
* Social media has given many people a powerful voice.  Sadly, many of the loudest people on social media are the ones who say these crazy things and hold these insane views.

That is all just my opinion.  Take it as you will."

I mean, think of it this way.  There are people out there who, for some reason, claim to have been in the military, but never were.  They buy the clothes and patches, talk like they were there, even tell stories.  Then someone comes along and overhears a story or sees a patch, and knows they are lying because they were actually in that company or fought in that battle.  You see the difference in the two, especially when the real veteran gets pissed off and kicks the hell out of the faker.

I see the Vault Hunters like that.  There are plenty that aim for the vaults and never make it.  There are some who claim to be vault hunters, but they are just liars and/or opportunists.  Lastly, there are the real vault hunters, few in number and they stand out among the crowd.
