Moderator: Senator, do you support gay marriage? 

Senator Biden: No. Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage. We do not support that. That decision should be left to the faith and the people who practice that faith... The bottom line is there should be no civil rights distinction between a committed gay couple and a committed heterosexual couple.

>Had we invested that money into healthcare instead people would have become more healthy and thus more productive, which would have grown the GDP more, and then give greater returns from tax revenues. 

This is a very childish suggestion and a foolish conflation. Let me explain why.

Firstly The US spends 3.5 trillion dollars annually on healthcare presently. The 400 billion bailout represents just a 12% limited increase in funding over one year. Certainly that funding would have done a lot of good, but represents just a drop in the ocean of the US' healthcare spending since the GFC. It does nothing to address the systematic rorting of healthcare in the US. It just pours more fuel on the fire. 

Secondly the Republicans would never agree to such a plan. So it doesnt really matter.

Thirdly, you're ignoring all the problems that occur when a bank collapses. You're aware that all investments and savings consumers hold with banks are lost when the bank collapses? The debts are not, as they are sold to creditors, but everyone with savings loses. 

I suggest you look up what people think would have happened if the banks had not been bailed out. Put simply, Financial havoc. 

This is the wrong way to look at both issues. The banks needed to be regulated properly. The regulatory bodies were woefully under equipped to properly enforce the laws, which themselves had been repealed. 

On the other side, US healthcare spending needs a program like Medicare for all to resign in the spending of private health insurance.

We can bail out banks and fund universal healthcare. We just need to get the Republican party out of power and as far away from power as possible.

>than the paltry 10 billion or so that we got back from the banks which was probably a loss when adjusted for inflation.
