GrowYourClit,ff7rlqj,t3_erydcm,1579656666.0,"Just because your clit is larger does not mean it is going to allow you to orgasm. Making it larger doesn’t increase the nerve endings etc. Also, partners I have been with have found that after pumping they actually have a harder time orgasming because they find their clit is somewhat numb. That said, I would still trying limping to see how it works for you."

You clearly have feelings for her and it will be a Hard thing to do, but pull the pin.  Find someone you can see and enjoy everyday."
relationship_advice,fetsxpy,t3_eqlvuo,1579379691.0,I only had to read the first paragraph. You’ve been in a “relationship” for a year+ and haven’t seen her yet?? This isn’t a relationship (sorry to be harsh). End things and find someone who lives closer. Once you do you’ll wonder why you ever put up with trying to have a long distance relationship. Good luck.
