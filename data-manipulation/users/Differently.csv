AskReddit,ffa9ps6,t1_ff9zaiy,1579730628.0,"Oh yeah, but they don't mean ""conduct unbiased research and come to a conclusion supported by evidence"", they mean immediately discard one of the two conclusions you might reach and exclusively look at material that supports the conclusion that remains. The first few sources are likely to be doctors and scientists, so you throw that away because it's ""just the mainstream opinion"" or whatever, and what's left is looney tunes."
AskReddit,ff9mi32,t1_ff9lntt,1579716100.0,"Setting that far-from-reassuring point that we're all going to die from something else before we die from this specific issue aside for now, what do you think would be an appropriate means of addressing those larger and more imminent problems? Rising ocean temperatures, you'd cut down on carbon emissions, right? Overfishing, you'd reduce the number of fishing boats in operation? It's all part of the same thing, you can't really tackle some of these problems without the solution being something interlinked with other problems -- it's the carbon cycle."
AskReddit,ff9m03w,t1_ff9ktwk,1579715807.0,"Yeah, you can always tell when someone's history is full of one-line comments insulting people.

But I'm a believer in the idea that trolls aren't doing it to prove a point to whomever they're spitting at, they're doing it to create doubt in the minds of the invisible audience. There's an implication of *See, I told this guy the science was wrong, and he didn't have anything to say back to that.* So I like to at least give a little push-back, because the trolls usually aren't willing to spend effort supporting their indefensible statements, when they would prefer to generate more low-effort garbage comments elsewhere. That way, at least a casual observer can come away with a link to Wikipedia and an assertion that there *is* evidence that when you pour carbonic acid into the ocean, the result is that there is more carbonic acid in the ocean."
AskReddit,ff9l46q,t1_ff9ix3y,1579715286.0,"There are a ton of journal articles, including such publications as *Science* and *Nature* (the top scientific journals in the world), with all the hard data you could want in the footnotes to this Wikipedia article. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification

The people arguing with you are dumb. 

I think a point they want to quibble about is that ""acidification"" is a misleading term -- seawater is slightly alkaline, and the ocean is so large that its pH won't literally move past neutral and become acidic. What it *will* do, however, is move slightly towards neutral and become less alkaline. And because the larger and more consistent a system is, the less change it is able to tolerate, a slightly less alkaline ocean will pretty much lead to a domino effect of cataclysmic extinction and food-chain collapse."

I'm not going to google these things for you -- there is actually *no obligation* for me to do homework on your behalf, surprisingly -- but I'll tell you to just go ahead and read everything ever written and formulate your own opinions. But you may wish to start with ""trump promises to release taxes"" and ""trump promises to testify"" because those will produce the sources you crave."

politics,fepp84l,t1_fepm9ov,1579326749.0,You need a source on Trump being a chickenshit? The guy constantly claims to have the courage of his convictions but neither puts up nor shuts up. He won't release his taxes despite promising to do so. He won't cooperate with investigations or testify in his own defense. There's no way he'll appear in debate -- he knows he'll be served his own ass on a platter.
