Jokes,fdfokgn,t1_fdf1aak,1578366484.0,"I like it even better when you let the listener figure out which is which: ""one of them has hope in her soul"", but this only works in the setting where the pattern is established (such as this thread)"
PuzzleAndDragons,fdeya1z,t1_fde6cfe,1578349164.0,"Hmmm. Gotcha. So this image is of floor 1, right? 
I'm too used to things with a title like ""Me after beating the 1st floor of complete annihilation"" with a photo of Squidward wiping sweat from his brows. I'm getting dumb now."
PuzzleAndDragons,fde67mu,t1_fddoz6t,1578332068.0,Sorry. Noob question. I don't know the dungeon and didn't get your post. This comment makes me think that your post has something to do with your healing amount vs the preempt of the next floor. Is that right or am I missing something?   (Or is this actually floor 1 of the dungeon and the screenshot is of you beating floor 1 (hence making it to floor 2)?)
GetMotivated,fc7wdug,t1_fc5s1je,1577520393.0,"I might be wrong but I'm sensing that you have a hard time believing that multiple people could be bad at their jobs.  Thank you for having the faith you have in us and the system. 

But if you think about it from a different angle, there are lots of accidents (not saying all) of various kinds that shouldn't happen on paper due to the numerous fail-safes on paper, but they happen because multiple people made mistakes (I think this is better than saying they are bad at their jobs, fuck ups don't require/aren't equivalent to people being bad at their jobs. ) I think I'm starting to get what you might have tried to express: what OP experienced shouldn't be a consistent case. It could definitely have happened due to mistakes, but for it to be consistent, those mistakes would need to be made again and again, which meant the parties involved are all bad at their jobs."
GetMotivated,fc5ppa0,t1_fc5anev,1577463319.0,"To be honest, it's not that unlikely to be the third case.   Can confirm that something like what OP experienced could happen (minus the drug tests) without an expression of active suicide plan because someone's terrible at their jobs."
