news,fdsit6r,t1_fds6hu5,1578703563.0,"i was in vancouver bc and went ot a whole foods there.  damn, all that ontario and quebec butter brands and raw milk butter is a dream come true.  sad fact is that none of it are available in us store shelves, not even in the nyc where new york state borders quebec and ontario. the only canadian brand dairy available inthe usa is liberte, andonly some types of dairy (yogurt, but not their cream cheese).

the us does have good dairy, and you have to look at small farms with high consumer ratings. esp dairies located in vermont and newyork state .  one problem is that ne wyork state used to be a huge dairy state, but it has been dying, and instad of supporting the dairy industry, ny state decided to build prisons to replace dairy farms and give people jobs.  it's not a good thing.  support dairy farms, not prisons."

moral of story, see a phone, leave it alone.

here's a tip: go to settings, click on security, (in the latest android, click on an additional settings button to access)
 the ""lock screen message"" option where you can put some contact info/message in case your phone is lost, and how you can be contacted.  this info is displayed when you turn on the phone and the phone is otherwise locked."

if you want all of the above in a cafe, or takeout place, you are out of luck.  if you want maybe 2 out of three (high quality tea and a good scone) a few places can do it proper as a takeaway for cheap.  nyc is more of a coffee and muffin place.

i've seen tompkins square bagels use harney and sons tea bags. they also sell scones on occasion

amy's bread has scones, silver moon bakery has scones.  a few other places including the union square greenmarket has scones.  those will be your best bet.

try whole foods market, zabars, and fairway in that order for clotted cream.  if one whole foods doesn't have it, try another.   zabars has a nice selection of jams including english ones, and specialty ones from chico california that is trendy.  all of the above will sell yorkshire gold, and p&g. barrys tea you have to get from fairway.  if you want  yorkshire gold loose tea you have to go to mcnulty's. harney and sons has a place in soho, but fuck those snobs."

eric kayser uses the liquid levant method where all the baguettes at his 200+ locations around the world are baked using the same sourdough starter that was originated from his first bakeries in france, flavor of baguette also depends on technique, and local ingredients used.

also recently [best nyc baguette](https://priscillamartel.com/best-baguette-new-york-2019/) was awarded to maison kayser. almondine in dumbo was ratedvery high for a number of years. the thing is, in nyc, people are highly opininated about things.  best this, best that.  people in the uws swear by silvermoon bakery.  people in the ues swear by orwashers.  who cares.  just enjoy what you have.  it's not a damn team sport.

i don't buy baguettes in nyc anymore. the best baguette in nyc seems like a notch below what you can get in france, for starters, it's amazing if you can buy them fresh from the oven, which is difficult to do at most bakeries in nyc.   anyway,  if you want a good place to buy miche, i suggest runner and stone, they have the best flavor, but they are super expensive. a good price to flavor ratio would be Amy's Bread, highly recommend them for everything.  other good bakeries are hot bread kitchen for non european breads.  grandaisy bakery for the pizza."

i stumbled upon this place when i was visiting paris for a few short days; ended up visiting 2 times, got pain aux cereales (3.50 euros) and two baguettes, and two croissants while i was in paris  mainly because i was cooking my own food and desired some bread to go along with my meals.  the pain cereales, i found had a really thin, crispy crust which was amazing. most of the time you find artisanal bread with thicker crust, this place did not.  the crumb was perfect. the baguettes you can get fresh from the oven as the turnover is high in the evening. the flavor was really good; i also tried two other highly rated bakeries for baguettes, one of the places i didn't like too much because of the flavor."
