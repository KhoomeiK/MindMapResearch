perth,ffsf8bp,t3_euwe6k,1580180251.0,"Hello and welcome to Perth!

1. Perth is pretty nice. You get to meet nice people if in the right neighbourhood. Climate-wise, Perth is alright, but summers are hot (can get to 43 degrees celsius), so prepare yourselves. Winter is comparable to Dublin winter.
2. Again, given the right area, you'll be pretty safe. Look at the inner-city ring area for the safest spots. Avoid the south-east corridor and Balga.
3. Rent is doable with minimum wage, cheaper than Melbourne.
4. Sights? Fremantle is the historic port city 20 kms from Perth, check it out. Others include a look around the airport, Midland and the Swan Valley (known for wine), Optus Stadium and Elizabeth Quay.
5. Transport is probably something Perth does well. We have a fair freeway (motorway) network and a well-done rail network with 5 radial lines and 1 spur line, soon to be 5 radial and 3 spur lines. Bus networks are dependent on areas, older areas closer to main arterial roads and the CBD typically get better transport than new, outer-ring areas. Check the Transperth website ([www.transperth.wa.gov.au](https://www.transperth.wa.gov.au)) for latest service details. These ten network maps should give you a good idea of the coverage:  [https://www.transperth.wa.gov.au/Journey-Planner/Network-Maps](https://www.transperth.wa.gov.au/Journey-Planner/Network-Maps).

Now again, welcome to Perth, hope you enjoy your stay!"
perth,ffsegg8,t3_euyfny,1580179729.0,"For public transport, you definitely want to look at the 'within 10 kilometres (approx 6.2 miles) from the city' ring. That will have the oldest and most dense public transport network (oldest I mean it's been developed since the 1960s, not that they use old buses). You also want to look around the rail lines. This should give you a more detailed look at the network:  [https://www.transperth.wa.gov.au/Journey-Planner/Network-Maps](https://www.transperth.wa.gov.au/Journey-Planner/Network-Maps). 10 maps covering Perth showing the bus routes and train lines in the area, giving you an idea of coverage."

Depending on where you live, you could get bored, however this is not always the case. There will be a shopping centre to go to somewhere, and if you get yourself into a sort-of 'friend group,' you'll be able to find places to hang out with them and chat.

Work can be hard to come by, especially since the mining/economy downturn here (but I'm only 13, so I'm just relaying what my dad said).

Transport should be easy enough, the public transport network here (Transperth, not Perth Metro) has more coverage and is easier to comprehend compared to Adelaide. The train system has consistently been rated best of the country, see [https://www.canstarblue.com.au/city-trains/](https://www.canstarblue.com.au/city-trains/).
