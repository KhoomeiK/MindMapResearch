rupaulsdragrace,fff7k1n,t3_etaup9,1579877698.0,So damn catchy.

personalfinance,ffcoluj,t1_ffcoj4g,1579803899.0,will it negatively impact my score? any way i can cancel the dispute once submitted?
personalfinance,ffciss5,t1_ffciprb,1579800366.0,Someone in another thread just said I can and should. Now I'm concerned I made a mistake by submitting the dispute on those three.

personalfinance,ffcg0cv,t1_ffcaeq2,1579798655.0,thanks!
personalfinance,ffceu67,t1_ffcc9w5,1579797939.0,I'm reading another reddit thread and someone said they disputed a few charges and their score dropped 150 points and it made it much worse. Is there a risk involved with what I am doing with disputing these? I don't want to make it worse. Now I'm anxious.
personalfinance,ffccho7,t1_ffcc9w5,1579796480.0,Thank u!!
personalfinance,ffcc3bo,t1_ffc9vnp,1579796228.0,"If I could nag you with one more question - sorry! So I just registered on Equifax, and I'm looking at my negative information. It says I was late one time on a credit card all the way back in 2016. Just once! But I guess it's on my report. So I selected dispute and it's asking me to tell them why. I selected two options - 1. That I paid it before it was sent to collections and 2. I have never paid this account late. The last one is technically not true obviously, but I am hoping they will take it off. It's also asking for a description of why I am disputing.

What did you say??? I want to make my best case possible. Do I just straight up say - hey I never paid this late! Take it off!! lolol. Even if that's not true? I don't want them to be like hello sir - you're a liar and so we won't take it off now."
personalfinance,ffc9jmg,t1_ffc9dx5,1579794628.0,"WHOA! That's incredible. Congratulations!!

I didn't realize you could dispute stuff on your report. Again, I'm so ignorant about this stuff! How do you do that? And what types of things can you dispute? Maybe I should look into trying to do that too."
personalfinance,ffc8u6c,t1_ffc8kao,1579794179.0,"Thanks! Any idea how long it takes to build up your credit? My score is very poor right now because of all the debt I had, but I'm trying to build it up as high as possible by the end of the year (or early to mid next year) as we're looking to purchase our first home or condo."
personalfinance,ffc8g99,t1_ffc8dvr,1579793929.0,thanks!! I realize that's probably a dumb question but I wanted to be sure. haha.
personalfinance,ffc8b76,t1_ffc7k6g,1579793839.0,thanks!!
personalfinance,ffc8aro,t1_ffc6oj0,1579793832.0,"Thanks!! If I charge let's say... $1000 for the month (utilities, groceries, etc) and I pay it off in full before the due date, do I avoid paying interest? Most of my cards are not big enough to charge rent and stay under the 30% utilization. So I have to start with smaller charges for now... just want to do it the smartest way possible avoiding interest. and building up that score baby!"
personalfinance,ffc8192,t1_ffc6oso,1579793662.0,Thanks! Does this avoid paying interest? I want to pay them the smartest way possible by hopefully avoiding interest and also building my credit score.

personalfinance,fezf6fp,t1_fezf1k7,1579456705.0,Very true. Good Tip. Will look into that and see if there’s a fee.
personalfinance,fezf2r7,t1_fez97bv,1579456669.0,I never have trouble paying my rent. I’m always on time. So I may consider it down the line. Going to pay off this debt first and then see how it goes after a few months.
personalfinance,feyp8hs,t1_feyoyba,1579448543.0,Gotcha. Makes sense. Thanks again!
personalfinance,feyordh,t1_feyolo8,1579448462.0,Can I ask what the added risk is in charging large things and paying them off immediately is? Just out of curiosity!
personalfinance,feyon1n,t1_feyolo8,1579448388.0,Gotcha. Much appreciated!
personalfinance,feyoia3,t1_feyobi0,1579448305.0,Yes I plan on doing this going forward! Does it also make sense to charge larger things (example: my rent) to a CC and then also paying it off immediately?
personalfinance,feyofcv,t1_feyobsf,1579448258.0,Thanks! I figured as much. I wasn’t sure if paying it off slower helped your credit score. Much appreciated!

Let me share my Jennifer Coolidge story while I'm here... I met her in Miami maybe 10 years ago. She was performing at the Improv comedy club for a week and I was working at a coffee shop next door. She came into the shop every day, was so friendly, and after a few days of chatting she invited me to the show that night! Afterwards, when the crowds had thinned out, I approached her to tell her how funny the show had been. She ran over and hugged me! Thanked me for coming, and then sat outside of the club with me for (hand to god) 30 minutes just talking. Just us 2! She had another show that night, and sat outside with me just talking until it was time for her to go back on. Asking about my life, asking about Miami, etc. Unreal. She did a routine in the show with a bagel, so I went to the shop and got her a new bagel for her next show. She hugged me! Then kissed me on the cheek!! I have a photo of her kissing me on the cheek somewhere. And said I was so sweet and she was glad she had met me. I never saw her again but whenever I see her in a movie or tv show I can't help but think about how crazy that night was and how unreasonably kind she is. the end!"
