I don't think you need much more. I am not a fan of using time tracking etc tools, since.. This doesn't help in any way. You track everything, but you just habe to get stuff done.

Since then, I have been improving a lot. I also see it as my only good chance achieving something, once it's in your vita, you can open a lot more doors.

It also shows everything I have to talk about with my boss this week.
