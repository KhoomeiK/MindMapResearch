socialanxiety,fdwl1xp,t1_fdrpsl9,1578759824.0,I hope it goes well!
socialanxiety,fdqxsa8,t3_emt7if,1578676354.0,"(This answer is based on my social anxiety but remember that everyone is different)
Maybe your friend isn't even that uncomfortable but they just have poor social skills. They might be, i can't tell you that.
My social anxiety makes me think that everyone hates me and talks to me only because they pity me. Maybe that's what your friend thinks too. Show them that you sincerely care about them and want to talk to them.
It is easier for me to talk to someone if they are outgoing and can keep the conversation up. Not having to worry that the whole conversation is on your shoulders is one less thing to worry about. When you make them feel loved and comfortable with you, they might become more open and comfortable. If that happens, please, don't make them feel bad for being ""too clingy"".
And don't let them become isolated. That might happen if they are never included in conversation on purpose. It feels good to see that someone wants to hear your opinion.
But too much socializing can be exhausting. Sometimes just listening a conversation is enough!
You seem like a great friend because you are makung the effort to try and understand your friend and their social anxiety. None of mine hasn't and it is terrible. But remember to also take care of your own mental health and set boundaries. I hope this helped even a little! :)

EDIT: you can maybe try and ask if they're comfortable to talk to you about their anxiety. If they are, that's great! If they're not, don't pressure them. They might wanna open to you at some point later after they've figured out and planned what they want to say!"

socialanxiety,fdml5hv,t3_em1qd6,1578554044.0,I live in Finland and my high school's teachers are really kind and understanding. I can often keep presentations to just the teacher if I ask for it and explain my situation. I'm really greatful for that.

UnusAnnus,fcd9nnb,t3_eh08rh,1577607963.0,Ethan's nail saloon and sensory deprivation tank (im not sure how to write it after ethan messing it up so many times) have been more like therapy sessions. They'll be fiiiiine!
UnusAnnus,fcd8prm,t1_fccfu9r,1577607746.0,"I'm sorry about that. It helps to know that putting the pet down is the best option. I'm sure your cat lived a wonderful life with you and putting him down was hard but right choise.

Our puppy sadly wasn't healthy when he was with us for the few days he was. But the first three days he was really happy. It was sad to see him lose his interest in everything and become really terrified. To the point he tried to hide away by tucking his head in corners or our legs and arms. So even if he somehow had gotten through of all of this, the change was he wouldn't grow to be mentally healthy.
So I know putting him down was the best choise for all of us. It still hurts but after a nights sleep I'm a little better and can think about this without crying like crazy."
UnusAnnus,fcd6jgq,t1_fcbveas,1577606978.0,Thank you for this kind comment! My social anxiety twists my thoughts and makes me think this kind of stuff... Thank you for saying this!
UnusAnnus,fcd68rh,t1_fcacla9,1577606869.0,"I'm sorry for that! It must've been terrible to constantly be afraid if someone you love is not there anymore. And it must've been scary for the other dog for they can't understand what has happened. Remember to enjoy and embrace the moments with them! (Clock is ticking, as our boys love to say) Sad thing about pets is that you'll need to bury many if them in your lifetime...
We also have two other dogs. One of them has been with us since I was ten. I'm seventeen now so I hope there will be atleast few more years for us left. But now I'm more afraid to lose him than I've been before. That is going to rip my heart to pieces..."
