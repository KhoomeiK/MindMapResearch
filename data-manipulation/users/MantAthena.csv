AskReddit,femxf8b,t3_eptxb3,1579272113.0,"My Dad is a hoarder. Years ago after my Mom passed away I convinced him to go through some boxes. There was one box he wanted set aside that I couldn't touch. The moment he wasn't paying attention, I took the box and looked through it.
I first found a private detective report on my Mom. Turns out she was  having an affair around the time my second brother was born. That brother looked nothing like my Dad. Turns out she was having an affair. I also found the autopsy report from when that same brother died after falling off his bike and hitting his head on a rock (this was before helmets were commonplace). He had massive internal bleeding on his brain. My Dad was on a business trip overseas, but my Mom made the decision to pull the plug before my Dad returned.
Then I found a letter from my Mom to my Dad. It basically said she was pregnant and she needed his permission for an abortion because she didn't want to have his child (this was the late 70s in my country back then you needed the father's permission for a non-medical abortion). My Mom was a terrible parent, and the letter obviously reinforced that she never wanted me in the first place. Opinion on abortion aside, it threw me in to a deep depression for many years, seeing proof that my Mom never wanted me and my Dad found it necessary to keep the letter."

Get vaccinated and get your kids vaccinated against HPV. Doesn't matter if you think you're monogamous or if your religion dictates no sex until marriage - viruses don't give a shit."

The side effects I get from it are much less pronounced except when I take them for multiple days. In fact when I was taking dimenhydrinate more frequently it was during a time I also had heart palpitations. And I was also taking Benadryl periodically for allergies.  Doctor figured I was too stressed and drinking too much caffeine. Plus I was having memory issues and getting angry easily so he put me on an antidepressant that is also anti-cholinergic! Explains why I still have memory issues and the periodic palpitation. Thank you kind stranger for the comment, I'll be sure to mention this to my Dr!"

My usual go to for short boat rides is dimenhydrinate.  Researched what astronauts use on space flights and figured if scopolamine is good enough for them why not. Didn't help the seasickness at all, spent most of the time rotating between puking off the side and laying comatose on deck. It also gave me these weird leg twitches and horrible nightmares. I swear I was even hallucinating. Plus I couldn't see anything with words on it. I could see the contours and whatever on maps okay but not the compass, distances, recipes, nothing!
