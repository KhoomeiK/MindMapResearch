This is about a guy who has made pred twice. This is about someone skilled enough to make master tier in the up coming season. He will be unable to make pred BECAUSE OF TIME!!!! If you can play 30 matches earning RP and I can only play 3 earning RP you have more of a chance to hit top 500 RP and I will stay master as I fall further and further behind. Not because of skill but because of TIME!"

If you actually have read anything you’d realize they are adding a new tier and making pred top 500 only. We aren’t talking about the average joe. We are talking about skilled players that have currently made pred on an hour a day play time not having time to reach pred next season. Because it becomes about time once you reach master tier."

I said they would not be able to, and as nice as it would be to work less, I am by no means demanding that I work less. 

But, since you brought it up here’s some entitlement for you, the rates our contractors change for our labor is more than double our package compensation, so yeah, I think management and the share holders could take a hit to their profit margins. The major contractors in my region have posted record profits over the last five years while our wages have been barely rising with cost of living. We have less buying power than we did forty years ago and our pensions are circling the drain. We are licensed, skill intensive labor that requires years of training. I bust my ass to make a living, to provide for my family and to do work that I can feel good about. You’re god damn right I want more money.
