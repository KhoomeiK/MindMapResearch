Leave be to you, and live with faith!"
Christianity,felkhmp,t1_fejrvum,1579224350.0,"No No No. The first thing OP needs to do to read the Word of God is to ""confess and repent to Jesus"" yada yada yada??? Now, we know as Christians that this is the end goal and the only path to true salvation. However, it is this forced, over the top attitude that scares so many curious souls away. The OP has expressed interest in the  Word of God and is actually advertising his desire to read it. That, in and of itself, is cause for praise.  I would say that him actually reading Scripture puts him in the top 10 percent of self professed Christians. We all know that there is true power in Scripture. Let the OP discover that for themselves. Forcing Christianity on someone is like forcing someone to fall in love with you. It doesn't work. Sorry for my rant, but I grew up in the Church and this forcefulness pushed me away. Eventually, the Holy Spirit revealed himself to me, but please know that these measures of ""you have to do this and you have to do that"" can be counterproductive, and I would argue, is a ploy from the enemy to drive souls away from God. Ask yourself this, did Jesus come with an in your face attitude of you have to do this and you have to do that? No, he lead by example, showed us the way, and we came to our on conclusion. We must lead others to salvation, not condemn and force the Truth upon others. Having said that, grace be to all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity."
Christianity,fefii5p,t3_eond1l,1579057025.0,Yes yes yes and yes. This church teaches false truth. They have the attitude that the Pharisees had when they lobbied to kill Jesus. It saddens me that this is even a real question. Start reading his word and listen to the Holy Spirit. Stop listening to these holier than thou pieces of shit.

Christianity,fe2ahf1,t1_fdzkog0,1578836295.0,"Yes, the focus on sex is absurd to me. We all have sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God. I am definitely a Christian, but I wholeheartedly disagree with Christian culture on this one. I mean, most the great men of the Bible were having sex with multiple women multiple times a day (Most likely). I mean, sure, don't make it a focus to go out and slut around, but on the other hand, having sex in a committed relationship without it being recognized by the government you live under, isn't the worst thing in the world."
Christianity,fe21dxe,t3_enf6tn,1578833415.0,"As a Christian that doesn't follow Christian culture, I completely agree. 
The thing that I despise the most about Christian culture is what I view is an artificial hierarchy placed on the value of sins or perceived sins. This hypocritical and irrational behavior unfortunately leads non-believers or people on the fence, per say, to loathe and make fun of Christians.
For example, I was a waiter and was waiting on the pastoral staff of a well  known local church. We were forced to offer draft beer suggestions to our tables. The pastors acted as if I had just dumped cocaine on the table and offered them a rail. Meanwhile, ALL of them were grossly overweight and proceeded to gorge themselves on double cheeseburgers, extra fries, and drank ranch like it was Gatorade. In this case, they viewed having a beer as worse than stuffing their fat faces. It's this type of behavior that makes people laugh and loath many Christians."

Christianity,fdcf3nt,t3_ekkgn2,1578273344.0,This is exactly what the enemy wants. The whole point of Christianity is the Devil getting people to turn away from God by tragedy striking them.

God allowed Satan to strike tragedy in his life so he would curse God and turn away. God allowed Satan to go after Job.

At the time of our split, I made double my ex and owned a four bedroom house. She was living with her cousin and her cousin's boyfriend, with 2 other kids in a 2 bedroom apartment.
