On the plus side if I fire a crossbow bolt and circle it a few times while its floating in the air in front of me, sometimes it hits someone xD"
news,ffi1fg6,t1_ffgbt0l,1579962201.0,The article says that by banning child marriage they would effectively be acknowledging same-sex marriage. Can somebody explain this backwards ass thought process to me?

Awwducational,fffzbur,t1_ffftxa9,1579895088.0,I think he was referring more to the fact that dolphins pick up other creatures (blowfish for example) and toss em around like balls just for fun or to get high. Not referring to them messing with humans when we enter the water.
modernwarfare,ffewxtc,t1_ffeupud,1579868872.0,"I didnt like it when I first got it, seemed kinda dumb to wear a bright purple sweater into a warzone.....then I remembered this is also a texan  that wears shorts out there and has an american flag themed signature weapon and idk I kinda developed a little personality for him and now I think it fits him pretty well"
modernwarfare,ffewgmf,t1_ffeqqxp,1579868375.0,"I mean I feel to a degree. But I mean you also gotta look at the fact that if you finished the battle pass you paid $10 for 1 completely new operator with 6 skins along with 3 new skins for 10 operators, that's 36 new skins. Let's also not forget the 31 weapon variants with over 5 of those being epic or legendary. Oh AND you get like 1300 CoD points which is enough to pay off the next battle pass for free. 

I mean of course they didnt put any SUPER flashy rewards in because the going price for those is $20 for 1 skin and 2 guns which we got 10fold for way cheaper, of course its lower quality loot.

Also just throwing this in as my personal opinion but Bales battle pass skin was also pretty badass"

shroomery,ff1a9q3,t1_feyptkf,1579476802.0,Trich isnt hairy like that it actually looks like the mycelium has turned green but nothing would grow out of it like this. As far as molds go it COULD be some form of phycomyces but as people have said it's also very possible a few grass seeds weren't properly pasteurized. Honestly looks more like phycomyces than grass to me but I cant tell well enough to say for sure.
MakeMeSuffer,fef0q45,t1_fedhynr,1579045455.0,"This is true HOWEVER there are exceptions for bad shedders and based on how easily that peeled, and how many beautiful snakes they had in a perfect setup I assumed these were professionals and did some research.

aww,fe9k83p,t1_fe6u7ok,1578938618.0,"Ok, you caught me I wasnt setting up any pun at first I was simply stating that the 8 inch needle directly into your stomach was a little scarier than throwing up both of which are because of rabies so yes I suppose you clarifying that rabies is still terrifying was needed. However I guess since you're asking you're too fucking stupid to figure it out so let me break it down. A pun you see, is a play on words, usually were one has multiple meanings. In this instance that word is point with two meanings: the point you missed which is that the giant fucking needle is scarier than the symptoms of rabies which though also scary can mostly alleviated by modern medicine. The second meaning being that thing that needles end in. Hope you're a little less of a dumbass now ;P"

Also the whole fucking point of using spraypaint is to paint quickly so...bit of a moot point"
WTF,fe22gx8,t1_fe1zmue,1578833771.0,Did anyone here say they vandalized shit? No. We've shown basic knowledge of how a can of spraypaint operates and how to make this shit. One person said they painted when they were a kid. Not to mention there are literally millions of ways using a spray can to paint can be good. My high school had an old train bridge back behind the property and every year senior class sneaks out there to cover last years mural. My first college out of high school even let us team up just like this and go apeshit on the art buildings back wall. Maybe actual criminals are a waste of air but maybe dont immediately act like you know someone is garbage just because they can do this. It's hard shit. I paid for a 450 class to learn it.

WTF,fe1revr,t1_fe1j3rp,1578830037.0,I used spray paint as a medium alot first semester and I can say from experience a fatcap spray paint can worked better for me than any roller or brush simply because I didnt have to go back over it or anything and it still gets massive coverage.

Ps. Sorry for the caps I'm not mad at you I'm frustrated just the clusterfuck of people in this thread who seem to not be able to see the giant not silver parts or dont believe (and are angry about it) that this can be done relatively quickly when theres an actual video of it happening. more of a vent that fit your comment than a personal attack"

I worked with spray paint a lot in college and this post is pretty correct put a fatcap on a can and you can get decent coverage pretty fast. Not to mention the guy linked a video of them doing this shit. It's a team of like 10 guys two cans in each hand like...im not condoning vandalism or anything but I dont understand why people are getting downvoting for saying you can do this shit in 20 minutes when they literally posted of a video of the guys doing it in twenty minutes. Sorry if I'm offending or missing something but theyre right with a good team and practice huge murals can be pretty fast and routine.

And there will always be more exploits that they'll learn to keep that rank if allowed to stay.
