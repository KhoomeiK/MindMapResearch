2: How do they know he’s not voluntarily celibate? Do they think any man who isn’t sexually active is automatically an incel?

3: Incels commonly spew anti LGBTQ rhetoric. That’s why nobody is taking them seriously."

On a day to day basis though? Hell no. The upkeep on that is crazy and it’d be bad af for my skin to do it everyday. I almost always wear no makeup, or maybe some light foundation and a bit of mascara."

fatlogic,ffbdb3l,t3_esos5i,1579760505.0,"Guess what, when I started running it was NOT joyful. I couldn’t run very far without hurting, I was sore, I was tired... but after about two weeks or so when my body started adjusting, it started GIVING me energy! If I slept in and skipped my morning run I’d be tired all day, and even if I didn’t want to go for a run, going for one anyway would make me feel better. Then I started getting even better, running long distances, getting *runner’s high.* 

Sometimes you have to do things because you know they’re good for you, even if they don’t feel that way at first and the payoff isn’t instant."

niceguys,ff80hqo,t3_es5vl4,1579662803.0,He straight up sent her “I need to cum” on Christmas. Even if she hadn’t already been ignoring him that would be ridiculous.
