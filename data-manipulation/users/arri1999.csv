DoesAnybodyElse,ffjmbuh,t3_etuwmh,1580001553.0,It’s the worst when you try to peek out to see who’s knocking and they see you so then you have to open the door lol
TrueOffMyChest,ffjlx4r,t1_ffigc5h,1580001274.0,But what you don’t know doesn’t hurt you. :(
TrueOffMyChest,ffja7uw,t1_ffj5paf,1579994051.0,Thank u so much
TrueOffMyChest,ffiigw0,t1_ffi1iy0,1579974649.0,Yes. :(
TrueOffMyChest,ffi12ax,t1_ffi0x1z,1579961861.0,It’s hard to get out of bed and do anything.
TrueOffMyChest,ffhylbs,t1_ffhxwta,1579959407.0,I guess telling my mom is so hard because I know it won’t erase the past and it will hurt her deeply. I’m also scared of not feeling any relief by telling her. But I think that’s my inner demons lying to me. I’m going to try my best to talk to her about it. I’m just so damn scared. :(
TrueOffMyChest,ffhybds,t1_ffhy22s,1579959114.0,Yeah I know that icky feeling. It took many showers to not feel absolutely disgusting. but showers can’t wash away psychological trauma and pain. Maybe I won’t ever feel ok again and that’s the scariest possibility. I’m so sorry to hear you’ve gone through this too.
TrueOffMyChest,ffhxyeo,t1_ffhxqvs,1579958724.0,I cope by using drugs as well. It’s the only thing that makes everything feel ok for a little while. I’m really sorry to hear that you’ve been through this too i wouldn’t wish this feeling on my worst enemy. Thank you for your kind words and I love you too friend.
AskReddit,ffehetv,t1_ffeh44i,1579848111.0,Yeah it’s not cool to lie to friends about shit like that. If someone lies about little things that don’t matter they’ll definitely lie about serious things too.
