Anxiety,ffev1zq,t3_et9and,1579866780.0,"You absolutely will be ok. It’s the fear of the fear that is most crippling. That’s good they are offering you the gas so you won’t even feel the needles and once everything is over and done maybe you can invest in a grinding guard or something and use the opportunity to take better care of your teeth. It may not seem like it but you are doing this to take care of yourself, it’s hard and terrifying for you but your health is worth pushing through this. When I complete something I’ve been fearing, I feel a great sense of relief and pride that I did it, I hope you get this too. You got this!!!"
Advice,ffenvj4,t3_et7em6,1579856482.0,That’s not silly at all. Unfortunately this is a life experience you’re going to have to go through. It will get easier with time as you will be focusing on your new life/home. You might choose to get your parents to FaceTime you with the cats or get them to send you pictures. When I had no pets and was feeling lonely I got a super soft snuggly plush to hug to sleep lol.
Advice,ffemzn6,t3_et7m2l,1579855179.0,"I (f) really like the look of tan leather belts or boots/shoes. Button up shirts rolled up at the sleeves. Fitted (but not skinny) jeans or trousers. I think investing in a nice pair of leather boots/shoes would really pay off, not fashion trend ones but classic. Also I think a quality satchel is stylish and a quality coat. Also investing in a clothes steamer easily helps keep wrinkles out of clothes because an important thing is keeping the clothes in prime condition wash after wash. And of course confidence when wearing them!"
Advice,ffbpml8,t3_esrgkf,1579777411.0,"I’m sorry I can’t offer something new but I use Insight Timer for sleep meditation. There’s lots of different free ones focusing just on getting to sleep and getting into “deep sleep” for varying lengths of time and they’ve really helped me. I know how frustrating and helpless it feels waking up wide awake all the time, it was a side effect of my medication and it took over 3 months for it to go away (mostly) for me. I hope you find something that works soon!"

Instagramreality,ff73m4a,t3_erw6ui,1579640448.0,(Edit: Was a response to someone saying it’s just surgery) When you see an unedited version of her in makeup you will disagree.
Instagramreality,ff73isn,t1_ff6kt33,1579640395.0,"Her skin texture isn’t smooth in reality, and the amount of makeup she cakes on it makes it worse - it’s insanely different to this. She definitely edits her face in pics like these. Also her lip lift scar is super rough and obvious in reality, she edits that out too."
Anxiety,ff4wqri,t1_ff2oaxh,1579574289.0,"The longest I've had the sensations last was almost a week. I was stuck in a full fight or flight attack, I couldn't sleep or eat or go to the toilet properly. I was constantly sweating but feeling super cold at the same time. I was off all medication at the time so I eventually went to the DR and got some valium which helped reset me. Since then I am back on regular medication and now these symptoms last maybe an hour or so, but if they don't go away I take an ativan or xanax or something. I only have to do that maybe once every couple of months or less."
Advice,ff2na6u,t3_erb7ws,1579514531.0,"I believe at the core is building your self confidence and sense of worth. These jealous feelings are generally irrational and all they do is make us feel miserable and harm the very relationships we were paranoid about protecting in the first place. Try and recognise the thought as soon as it pops into your head, rationalise that it’s just you being to hard on yourself, instead try and value the friendships that you have and just commit to being a good person and friend."

Anxiety,ff2lpfi,t3_eralle,1579512085.0,"Hi there, firstly I’m sorry your dealing with this it sounds horrible. And to answer your question, I wouldn’t describe my experience as pins and needles but more like a full body humming / wavering  sensation with waves of numbness. It definitely interferes with my gut in all sorts of ways and gives me a tight yet hollow feeling in my chest/sternum."
offmychest,ff2li1k,t3_eramp1,1579511782.0,"Are you medicated as well? Definitely continue your therapy and let your therapist know everything you said in this post. I would also suggested telling your partner everything in this post too. Besides therapy and medication, I think a healthy outlet for your anger and frustration would be helpful, as well as asking your therapist for some coping mechanisms when you’re in that moment of anger/flipping out so you can learn to regain some control over yourself. Recognise when the situation is becoming too much and remove yourself from it so you can take some breathes, scream into a pillow etc. Make sure you communicate with your partner about what’s going on with you."

Advice,fe7hdrx,t1_fe7ft6b,1578914479.0,"Some people are crazy and harsh. It’s not a meme that I know of, but it’s mercury/poison and would kill him. I know this might be more than what you’re asking but I listen to a lot of mental health podcasts and it’s incredibly common for the human brain to be sexually turned on by what is it’s deepest fear. Example: rape fantasies, or being submissive/losing control, incest etc. These are all very common kinks and most people hate themselves for being turned on by these things and would never seek to play them out in real life. There’s theories that it’s the brains way of coping with trauma and regaining control over the trauma. The brain is a strange thing!"
Advice,fe7fyqz,t1_fe7ffds,1578914145.0,"I’ve just never heard of having “evictions” from a group, of friends or voting etc. That sounds more like a reality tv show. Why can’t she just be casual friends with some of you? She doesn’t have to hang out with 10 of you all the time in order to be called a friend to some of you. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing, and it doesn’t have to have labels and conditions. It all just seems very formal and judgemental to me, the opposite of what a group of friends should be. If I were you I would just let it go."

Just judging on how I was as 21 or even 26 etc. I was very mature for my age but under all that I really wasn’t emotionally mature. I needed more experience to grow and learn and come into myself. I had 3 long term relationships and they all died around the 3-4 year mark even though I thought I would marry them lol. So while I don’t think it’s “wrong” for this marriage, I think it will have issues and probably not work in the long term. But I’m a stranger!"
Anxiety,fe070bf,t1_fe06mfb,1578804706.0,"Ahh so you’re right in the thick of it. I really think you should speak to your psych and explain the severity of your anxiety during this switch over. Tell them your panic attacks are terrifying and the Ativan just isn’t helping. Again I’m sorry you’re going through this, I know it’s horrible to feel helpless against these feelings. Just try and keep hold of the thought that this is temporary and you will feel safe again."

Advice,fe04rkw,t1_fdzwp6t,1578803054.0,I can’t say for certain as I’m not a nutritionist but you should try and grab some juices at the store that have natural fruits or vegetables in it. If you can stomach more liquid then try a soup or broth.
Advice,fdzrwxj,t3_engzst,1578794366.0,"Well I agree you should go to a doctor. But otherwise, what about drinking? Are you able to start injecting some nutrients in smoothies or juicing? If you can’t eat much in one meal, try grazing through out the day. It’s very important that you get at least the minimal required nutrients. Maybe consider taking a multivitamin every day too (though this isn’t a replacement for food.)"
Instagramreality,fdzre41,t3_endo1b,1578794031.0,"With all the time spent editing every single photo - she should just get (more?) work done on her chin, jaw and nose. Although it would be an extensive overhaul for sure."

I wet it a little and rub it on my pits and it takes away the smell of doing it at the end of the day, or prevents smell when doing it after shower. I highly recommend googling it and trying one out."
Advice,fdt7deh,t3_en1wpd,1578712885.0,Have you tried the deodorant crystal? I used them a lot when I was a teenager and now I have one I use about once a week. I build a resistance to deodorants really quickly and they smell awful which is why I still use the crystal sometimes.
Botchedsurgeries,fdpso86,t3_emcydn,1578638950.0,She also has the whole double lip thing which is mortifying. I really hate fillers! They look great in a perfectly angled Instagram filter but at a different angle- your face looks like it’s melting off.

Anxiety,fdlxiw1,t3_em2moh,1578534870.0,"That doesn’t make you a bad person or perceived as a bad person. Your anxiety is making this incident (and others I’m sure) into a huge deal when it was just an ordinary everyday life situation. Please speak to a therapist about your suicidal ideation, you don’t deserve to suffer or deal with this alone."
Anxiety,fdlwvua,t3_em2moh,1578534436.0,Hi there. What sort of things do you mean by “so bad things” or be a bad person?
Anxiety,fdiojf7,t1_fdik93w,1578447513.0,"It was fine, one of mine was ""impacted"" which is why it kept getting infected. I was able to drive myself home afterwards. I was silly and didn't get the painkillers he prescribed me that night, I was going to get them the following morning- and then I barely slept that night because the anesthetic wore off and my jaw hurt. So I went to a 24/7 pharmacy and got the script filled and once they kicked it it was fine.

As far as pain during the procedure, I didn't feel any pain. I'm sure dentists deal with anxiety a lot from their patients because even people without anxiety- it's common to have a fear of dentists. So just be honest with them so they can make you feel as comfortable as possible. When you've done this you'll have the satisfaction that you did it! And the bonus of not getting toothaches and infections."

Advice,fdhqdvd,t1_fdgzs7l,1578428106.0,"I guess this depends on if you want to call them out and risk losing the friendship/ having a bunch of drama. You could offer advice about how their life seems really traumatic since getting with this person and if this relationship is really the best thing for them. Alternatively you could continue the friendship on as normal but not invest yourself into these crazy storylines, withdraw yourself to a casual friendship - maybe one day you guys can meet up again and you can see if the crazy spills over. Personally I would let the friendship fade in hopes of reconnecting with them at a later date with less crazy, as I like to avoid all forms of drama cause my anxiety can’t handle it well."

TheExpanse,fdgftq6,t1_fdg45lk,1578394852.0,"Same, at first it annoyed me a bit as I viewed it as an inconsistency, but even irl you naturally mimic the slang and nuances of different languages when you’re speaking with native speakers vs. English for example.

Advice,fdg52js,t3_el7q8b,1578380329.0,"You feel this way because you’ve been conditioned for the past 9 years to think that you’re the problem and you have had to cater to his needs if you wanted to avoid conflict. Please do not go back. This is the start of your life! Think of it in the way that the relationship was unhealthy for both of you, he needs to be out of it just as you do. There’s no point going back and spending another 9 years in pain. I left an abusive relationship 6 years ago (and our animals and possessions) it was so hard but so rewarding. I got my independence back. I spent time learning that I don’t deserve to be treated like shit. I’m now in a relationship and have been for a few years and NOT ONCE have we treated each other anywhere near like the old crap I put up with. Not only was my ex abusive but I also turned into a person I didn’t recognise- it’s liberating to let that go. Please keep moving forward, don’t look back."
Anxiety,fdg4pw5,t3_el7qqf,1578379933.0,"Absolutely! I also hide my online status on online messengers because I like to be online without being “available”. I really dislike the constant expectation of being available to chat all the time. Of course it’s great for emergencies and such, but it’s too draining if certain people take advantage of you with it or guilt trip you for not being responsive all the time."
Advice,fdg4k7j,t3_el7rej,1578379761.0,"Well that was a wild ride just reading that. How exhausting... I can’t say for certain of course but in my experience it’s best to go with your gut feeling. Make sure you don’t give them money if they ask you or anything like that because it doesn’t seem legit. With that being said some people just attract insane bs and I like to steer away from those people because it’s too draining for me, and it’s also mentally harsh trying to figure out the truth."

Advice,fdcpmjt,t3_eknygy,1578280866.0,Get to a doctor if you can. Vitamin B always helps me after I drink. Anti nausea tablets may help so you can try and get hydrated.

Advice,fd8rumz,t3_ekbl56,1578222514.0,"I’m very sorry for your losses and that when you’ve tried reaching out it’s been treated as a joke. People often act that way when they are uncomfortable and don’t know what to say or how to respond. (And also if they think you aren’t being serious.) Some people with depression or anxiety also treat things as a joke as a coping mechanism. 

I can only encourage that you keep trying to reach out, connect with people and try and be open with your struggles. It’s not about how they react, that is out of your control, it’s about you freeing yourself of some of the burden. Nurture relationships that do react in a positive way. 

As far as feeling better, without medication and therapy I can only suggest positive lifestyle changes. Diet, meditation, exercise, being social, mindfulness etc."

We are a “multicultural” country so we have a lot of different people but legit if you have a different than white skin colour- your experience is going to be more difficult.

If anything I would just be worried that her attention has ramped up so much so quickly after her breaking up with her last bf. People that shower you in attention may lose interest in you very quickly once the relationship has “played out.” But it’s too early to worry about such things.

Also the fact that they offered you so much more money to sty is kind of insulting that you spent 6 years there and weren’t valued enough to get raises anywhere near that figure. If you stay you will be miserable and he would never give you a raise again. At least at the new job you will have new people and experiences and a chance to grow. Personally I would cut ties with him 100% when your date is up. Tell him it’s in conflict with your new position and your don’t have time or energy to do extra work. Good luck!"

Advice,fcwfd9r,t1_fcwal1i,1578024197.0,"That’s a shame! I use can chickpeas, I rinse them and then toss them in a bake tray with veggies. Sometimes I do a “mexi bake” which is chickpeas, tomatoes, peppers, coriander and some sort of salsa and a sprinkle of cheese, baked in the oven and I have it with a few corn chips or tortillas and fresh lime. You can put pretty much whatever you like. There’s a lot of recipes on flavouring chickpeas in a pan which you could have with steam veg. Another huge thing for me is stir fry, you just need to learn how to cook it right to your preference. I saw a cool recipe for baked sweet potato where you scrape out the middle “stuff” it. They blended avocado and peas put that on top. I don’t like sweet potato (but it’s good for you)."

This happens to me too but I’m kind of hyper aware to quickly scroll past stuff now and I IMMEDIATELY clear my mind/flood my mind refusing to let the image penetrate. I suggest imagining a safe space, take some time to imagine the visuals, weather, sounds and everything (mine is a Japanese moss garden, it’s humid cool and I can feel the cool stone beneath me) once your intrusive image comes in your head- acknowledge it and calmly swap over to your safe space and become aware of all the details as you slowly breathe to calm down and decompress. Try and do this every time you remember the bad image. Other than that the most specific cases that have imprinted on me faded with some time."
