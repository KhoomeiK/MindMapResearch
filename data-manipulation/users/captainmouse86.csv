interestingasfuck,fflvcuu,t1_fflpuyh,1580044610.0,This also don’t have time zones and I think it crosses what could be 5-8 zones. So it says 1pm  but it could be a different time of day relative to us.
todayilearned,ffesacm,t1_ffdvn2w,1579863106.0,Could be. It isn’t a chain. Just similar names.
todayilearned,ffdarxy,t1_ffc7psc,1579816833.0,"Yes. This. I meant Essex county Ontario, which is part of Windsor-Essex County nowadays and is directly across from Detroit. Not counting waiting at the border, I can be at the old Vernors bottling area in 20 mins. 

On a side note: consume Canadian Club and Vernors for, what I call, the Borders Drink. We make Canadian Club Rye on the Windsor side.... or you can go with Crown Royal and make it premium, which is made 40mins to the west (Amherstburg... where we held off the Americans in the 1812 war is home to crown royal) direct across from Willow Run (Home of the WWII B-24 bomber). Vernors is the “aged and spiced” ginger ale which has a bite like none other (and an interesting story that includes fighting in the 1812 war and forgetfulness). 

We have some crazy history along this small river that separates us. And if you look into a Vernors and Canadian Club or Vernors and Crown Royal... it encompasses a lot. 

And that’s leaving out the gang and bootlegging activity. It was quite interesting around here in the early 1900s to mid 1950s.  Rum Runners and Al Capone were a definite thing on our river front."
AMA,ffbyhvf,t1_fep6ixt,1579786797.0,Doesn’t mean you aren’t brothers. Some brothers look nearly identical. Time to have a talk with mom.
AMA,ffby939,t1_feqd9bc,1579786590.0,"I can see what you’re saying, but context and intent is everything. Think of how many people are in the background of online photos. None of those people gave permission. 

Consider:
-his name wasn’t posted.  
-looking at it, I had no idea which one was the poster.  
-basically every time the original OP posted a photo of himself, he posted a photo of the other guy.  
-the was no malicious intent, no trying to shame the guy, make fun of him, create havoc for him.   
-in this day and age, if a random person takes a photo with you, especially for a “comparison/you seeing this!” photo... you can guarantee it’s getting posted online. 

Also, this is the internet, the vast majority of people have been posted without permission at least this was a wholesome post."
todayilearned,ffbxc80,t1_ffbmbwd,1579785810.0,"We have an old school place called “The Dairy Freeze” that’s like the original Dairy Queen (honestly not sure what came first).  It has amazing soft-serve. I’m like you, I don’t like heavy or really sweet. But their soft-serve is creamy, soft , yet thick, and full of vanilla flavour. There are a load of options to add on top, but they don’t do the mixy thing.  It’s an insanely busy place in the summer and the ONLY place I’ll get ice cream.  

They still use car hops (teenagers who make massive cash during the few months it’s open) who come to you vehicle to get your order and bring it to you.  Or you can pick up you order and eat it in the park-like large backyard/field they created. They make this drink called a Boston Cooler, a Vernors and ice cream float. I get one every time. No idea why it’s called a Boston Cooler when Vernors is a Detroit pop, but you can tell a person grew up in  Essex county if they are familiar with the Boston Cooler."
todayilearned,ffbvsf3,t1_ff9376t,1579784420.0,Not sure. But I wouldn’t be surprised. My parents lived on a farm way out in the county and used to collect arrow heads.
todayilearned,ffbvqjx,t1_ffatfsz,1579784373.0,"Used to live there, my parents still do. Beautiful town."
todayilearned,ff8uo9y,t1_ff8rlk3,1579696698.0,"Same in Southern Ontario. We have a few areas (particularly under the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor,ON) that were known to be Native American Villages. Before any type of excavation is done, an archaeological dig must be done under the supervision of the current tribe (Walpole) at the expense of the builder. Any items found get logged and given to the tribe. Any remains found must be reported to the police (confirm they aren't recently dead/murdered) and given a proper reburial, complete with ceremony, designated by the Walpole tribe.  It's actually pretty neat and interesting... but it is expensive for the builder and takes a lot of time. But, I'm a believer in properly maintaining history and respecting the dead."

nextfuckinglevel,ff7vs3u,t1_ff7sy8m,1579659530.0,"That fact you think there is an “agenda” and not... you know, history, says a lot.  Yes... It’s all “their fault” because of that one time they fought with each other, /s.

People who can’t relate:

Those whose commute takes them through the ghetto

Those who travel long country roads, sparse with humans

Those who deal with crazy traffic jams

Those who live in Canada in the winter"

instantkarma,ff6yy4c,t1_ff6qq7l,1579637764.0,Thank you! Yes there are fake videos but not every scenario and individual can be categorized into what constitutes a “real reaction”. People behave weird.

By this statement, pretty much the entire internet is stupid."
brooklynninenine,ff6v2lv,t1_ff66d3x,1579635483.0,Me neither. I first noticed AM800 while scrolling and was surprised to see the Spits. This is also my fiancé’s and favourite B99 scene.
