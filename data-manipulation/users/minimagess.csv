MomForAMinute,ffwzqvw,t3_ev7ynv,1580314650.0,I'm so proud of you.  You've made life exponentially better for that little girl.  She's going to have a major boost in her mental health because you did was needed.  Thank you for making a difference.

Anxiety,ffrlmku,t3_eur8r4,1580160575.0,"You will make it through this.  Is there any way you can take a break from something?  Take a vacation, even if it's a road trip somewhere nearby?

Please look into some mindfulness meditation or strategies.  Know that you are doing great on your own time and your struggles are completely normal."

Catswithjobs,fffvnii,t1_fff3cij,1579892795.0,"I didn't let my cat in with her kill one day.  She was pissed off, yelled at me lots.  Then she gulped the dead mouse whole and stomped off in disgust.

Another time, my husband decided to clean out the pantry.  The first thing he touched when he reached in, was a wet, dead mouse.  At least she put it in the right spot...

Yet, another time, I noticed my kid had his rain boots on the wrong feet while we were getting in the car.  He was sitting in his car seat as I pulled the boots off.  A flat, dead mouse fell to the floor of the car.  I was running around in circles, screaming, crying and laughing.  My husband, his friend in the passenger, and my kid were all waiting patiently for me to pull myself together to utter the words ""DEAD MOUSE!"".  The thing was that my kid had been wearing these boots for the whole morning while on a walk."

pics,ff63o0e,t1_ff5lzk2,1579618330.0,My cat has gotten into the habit of snuggling my face without snuggling on my face.  She'll lay on my neck and place her face on mine.  It's usually pretty sweet until a whisker tickles the heck out of me.
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff3lwah,t1_ff26xce,1579543836.0,"He was apparently banned from where I live because he put his bare genitals on a security person.  Now that I think of it, it probably just because of conservatives and ""manson=school shootings"""
Parenting,ff38me5,t3_er8jvl,1579536275.0,"I read somewhere (sure you can google it), that boredom for kids is incredibly valuable in figuring out what they like.  Structure and planned activities are great, but a kid has to be ""bored"" so that they can do some of their inner-thinking, or the adult version of ""soul searching"".

Also for the structure and socialization part; they get a good dose of that at school.

I enjoy being bored time with my 5 yr old.  We end up with impromptu dance parties and lots of silly play.  Some times when he's bored, he'll help me out with chores!

Also, this post has reminded me I haven't signed him up for any extracurricular activity for the new year yet! Oops."
