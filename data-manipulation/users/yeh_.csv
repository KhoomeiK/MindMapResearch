Monstercat,fekgz5v,t1_fejfwn9,1579199841.0,"Monstercat always labels those EPs. The only time when they're singles is if a song is accompanied by a remix (like The One) or two (like Sweat) or an alternate mix, such as an extended mix or a radio mix. Emergency EP, Another Day EP and We Are One EP seem to be exceptions but they were released quite a while ago"
Monstercat,feh7vbz,t1_feh3z6v,1579110968.0,You replied in my thread asking for your favorite memories so you helped :)
Monstercat,fegonzs,t1_fefpes6,1579098870.0,"Theoretically there should be the same number of compilations. It used to be 3 releases weekly and an album having 30 songs, which takes 10 weeks ideally. Now it's 4 releases and an album requires 40 songs. Or if you want to separate the channels, the numbers are 2 and 20.

Either way the efficiency of releasing compilations stays the same."
Monstercat,feg100v,t1_fef9bc6,1579072309.0,All the positive feedback from you guys makes it worth it. I've done smaller Monstercat projects but this seems to have the biggest impact by far and I'm really happy you liked it!

Monstercat,feea98y,t1_fee9mh2,1579029614.0,"I'd like to make it into a video for the 10 year anniversary so it's easier to read, manage and has more possibilities (such as music). So yes, in a way. But I will need to correct a bunch of the mistakes I'm finding now and either learn how to animate it or find someone who would be willing to help.

I actually tried to do it for this year but because I have zero experience in projects like this, I scrapped it. It took me way too long, was even more tiring than the infographic (I did it in powerpoint using animations) and I wasn't exactly satisfied with where it was going. It was meant to be a moving timeline of songs that would stop in certain places, such as new artists.

But hey, maybe I'll pick up a skill or two this year. No promises though."
Monstercat,fee97c1,t1_fee8rap,1579028997.0,"It did. That, and CPU power"
Monstercat,fedyv9n,t3_eooc0q,1579022792.0,"If you'd like to see it all in one image, go [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/5/folders/1n9G7ktbA_a6HOn20drPZQ8v36duenflf). The larger file is 120MB and can't be opened without downloading it but the compressed version (25MB) can. Its quality is a bit lower but it's readable.

Hey. So what you see above is the final result of a project I have been working on for the past month. It was originally meant to be a project celebrating the end of the decade but I had to wait until UV8 was released for the background art. That's why 2020 songs aren't on the list. I have put way more hours into it than I would like to admit but I did it because I love Monstercat and its community, that means you guys. I'm passionate about the label and I wanted to summarize its history for new fans (who might find it interesting), as well as the OGs (for a nostalgia trip).

I'm not new here but I haven't been around for that long, either. I joined in 2015. For this reason I needed to do my research, which was a daunting task. Most of the sources are listed in the last panel of the infographic. I also made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/eeji93/what_moments_of_monstercats_history_would_you/) thread asking you to share your favorite memories, thank you to everyone who gave a response: u/EscheroOfficial, u/NinsMCD, u/harris_kid, u/Dr__Drew, u/andrewmp19, u/swolmart, u/RedAndWrong, u/MaruMusic_, u/pielover57x, u/Aureolix, u/ImWorthlessOk, u/LunaticOmega, u/QuackoPerson, u/NobushiKohai, u/Maknirak, u/JoksderGeilomat, u/WeDoMusicOfficial, u/Aventasaurus, u/Pulver1ze, u/hellomainaccount, u/BlamoVsFlamo, u/Regaws, u/RIP_My_Phone, u/Veldhuis94, u/-aza- and u/TheKuroWolf. A lot of the trivia was added thanks to you so I just wanted to credit all of you.

Lastly, while I don't want to sound like a beggar, I'm afraid I have to. If you know anyone who might find this interesting, don't hesitate to share it! I spent a lot of my time to make this for those who care about the label as much as I do and I would love them to have a chance to see it.

Thanks for being there, guys.

My logic with grouping Synthwave together with Indie Dance is that most PYLOT's tracks were labeled Indie Dance by Monstercat in the past.

Monstercat,fdyexiv,t1_fdyd2ls,1578778985.0,"Automaton was labeled Techno for a short time but was changed to Electronic, I guess they didn't want to repeat the RnB drama. Other than that, Freak is the only one.

I'm not going to be creating new sections because the colors are already familiar to everyone as they are, so all Indie Dance / Nu Disco / Pop / whatever is going to be turquoise.

I'm not going to lie that I get really excited when I see someone claiming to be a fan from 2011-2012. They are the veterans of Monstercat and I'm always interested in the stories they might have about this community. I do look up to them, sometimes, because it fascinates me."

My family has always been great though, so that's a difference. But I don't think it's what matters here if it used to be normal before those few months.

I think you should ask yourself what changed between the last time you ate normally and the first time you felt nauseous. Did you find out something repulsive about her? Did she do something to lose your trust and now you feel betrayed? Did you get attracted to her, as in wanting to pursue a relationship? Did you change your opinion on some of the secrets you told her?

If you were to ask me, I think it'd be beneficial to get rid of the Twitch Stream in favor of better design and more functions. If it functioned similarly to the website but better, I think I would even use it over Spotify. I don't use Spotify much really so I don't have premium and it would be a good alternative.

I will list some ideas for inspiration!

* Creation of playlists
* 'Favorites'
* More by this artist (or essentially a way to navigate through releases beyond the search bar
* Shuffle discography (and I don't mean every release on the website because it includes album mixes, podcasts, etc. Just every song)
* A real-time visualizer
* More info about the songs? Like, their genres, durations, or ""appears on"" would look great if presented well. It would be more of a wall of text with the current UI though
* Browsing by artist. It would be a function the website hasn't developed well because in the early years a bunch of artists are missing. An automated process could fix this, I think
* Some default playlists? Like ""calm"" or ""exciting"". Maybe based off Monstercat's Spotify playlists or the tags of each song, I think that can be automated"
