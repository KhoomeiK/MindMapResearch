Always talking about it because it's real... You have feeling you're on the set and everything is fake. It's really not what i want when i'm watching a film"

videos,ffhuh02,t1_ffhtrss,1579954473.0,You're not that smart are you? You cannot hide 90 thousand dead people. Even if they had massive graves(which are easily visible in this day and age) and ovens (like germans) it would easily be seen by other nations.
Android,ffhu3vk,t1_ffhr3b2,1579953969.0,That's much more work than just fake name

Xiaomi,ffht38z,t1_ffhrvkm,1579952496.0,I've read some threads on xda and here that unlocking bootloader automatically brings you widevine level to l3. Locking the bootloader again gets it back to l1 though.
