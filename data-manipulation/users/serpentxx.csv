But generally i will put in some effort and read the reviews etc, i now have a few stores i trust as i have bought heaps of xiaomi products from them over the years and all have been genuine"

IPTV,fel7yk1,t3_ephr69,1579216014.0,"I sign up for niche IPTV that have South east asian cable hannels (still in english and channels like HBO,food network etc, just closer to my country, also guessing local laws make adverts a bare minimum, like 1-2 adverts every hour which is great).

I am however noticing if i want more stable and reliable services, i need to signup for APK's, not M3U's.

Does really suck as most of the APK's user interfaces remind me of a high school kids flash project, but at the end of the day the channels are stable, in sync and sometimss have epg.

Oh and they are way cheaper than other services.

My last provider that was rock solid and had m3u was about $14usd a month, i left as they removed south east asian channels.

My current provider is APK only, but is $5.20usd a month, probably because it removes all the other countried and focuses on malaysia/indonesia/singapore/taiwan/hongkong/china.

really cant complain, keeps the wife happy"
todayilearned,feio14u,t3_epaqee,1579143015.0,"If you win the lottery, probably wise to do the following.

- Dont spend a cent or quit your job until the money is cleared and in your account, so many articles of people going on spending spreas only to soon realise they missed the jackpot by a single number.

- If anonymity and counseling is available, take it(Yes in Australia counseling is provided to lottery winners)

- Tell as little people as possible you won, if you must tell people, do it slowly, maybe wait a few weeks/months after winning.

- Sort your financial security out first, pay off any debt you have, pay off your mortgage or car, buy a modest home etc

- after all that, go nuts to the point that you dont end up in debt and lose everything and end up worse than before you won."

JB is selling the Mi 9T for $599, you can import it from aliexpress for $370, im sure taobao is even cheaper.

JB is doing a great trade, but most retail stores are just importing stuff and increasing the price to a stupid value and expecting it to sell in the hopes that people havent done their research or are simply too lazy to wait for an online order or put stock into a local warranty"
