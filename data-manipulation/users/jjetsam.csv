madmen,ffab3e6,t3_esadz2,1579731423.0,So nobody has an answer as to why that relationship was so special? Just insults. Classy.
madmen,ffa9rdx,t1_ffa34dq,1579730654.0,All of Don’s relationships were sleazy. Except maybe the one with his wife.
madmen,ff9lbvo,t3_esadz2,1579715411.0,I don’t understand why everyone loves the Don and Rachel relationship. She was independent? She still fell for his charms. What makes them less sleazy than all the other women?

environment,ff3ehkj,t3_er5ltc,1579539431.0,"idk — during the campaign was I the only one who heard him say (paraphrasing) ‘We have enough environment. We need more business.’ It was so telling, he said in in such an off hand manner. A toss away really. My guess is that except for golf courses his feet have never touched unpaved ground."
AskHistorians,ff3cpvs,t3_er02j0,1579538533.0,"To add a little personal perspective from an actual student in the 1960’s :  My white elementary school was desegregated in 1960/1961. I have no idea where the 6 or so  black students went (I was 11/12 yo) but they did not return the following year. Anne Arundel County in Maryland did not totally desegregate until 1966 when Bates High School in Annapolis closed. The black teachers were absorbed, to some degree I suppose, into the existing high schools; three in my school. My first teacher of color! Me and all my friends were nonplussed but I have no idea how the adults reacted. Or how the new teachers felt about working in an almost completely white school. They were difficult times for adults. I don’t remember caring what color my school mates or teachers were.
