Basically it goes like this. There is a family of viruses called S(Simian)IV that infects monkeys and apes. SIV mutated every time it jumped species of primate. When SIV jumps from primate to human, it becomes H(human)IV.   Scientist studying the different strains of HIV found similarities between specific strains of SIV and HIV.  The different strains of HIV don't branch off from a common strain of ""HIV"", instead SIV jumped from primates to humans multiple different times, which is why there are so many different strains of HIV and the areas with the largest diversity are also where hunting of primates for food takes place."

Fact is that the community built itself into the federal district after it's creation full well knowing that the district itself was never intended by the founding fathers to send their own representation to congress. Washington D.C. was created to NOT be in an existing state or a itself be a state itself.  What you are wanting is exactly opposite of why it is even in existence.

politics,ff8s5n7,t1_ff8pn4l,1579693971.0,"DC was created to be a federal district under control of congress, so that the three branches of the federal government can operate independently of any one state.  This was created BY THE CONSTITUTION, after congress (under the articles of confederation) was held hostage by a group of armed revolutionary war veterans protesting.  Congress asked the city(Philly) and/or state(Pennsylvania) for help, to which they said it wasn't their problem and didn't get involved. With the creation of a stronger federal government, part of the compromise of the constitution was that the new government would need a neutral site that no one state would be able to exert more influence than another.  During the Constitutional Convention, a clause was included that gave congress the right to form a federal district that congress would have control over. Maryland and Virginia ended up being asked to give part of their states, to create such a place.  DC must remain a unique city for the other states to come together and find compromise on neutral grounds. 

Today the federal government remains the largest employer in the district  and much of the city's economy and budget is directly or indirectly connected to the federal government. The people of DC have more access to and more influence over the government than the residents of the states for which it was created to serve.  If the people of the states decided that they wanted to move seat of the federal government and create another federal district, Washington DC would suffer an economic collapse when the federal jobs, funding, and facilities leave. 

The Federal District must remain a state neutral site. If you want to have a senator or be in a congressional district that who's representative has voting rights in the house, you are free to move to one of the 50 States."

1. Joker - great piece of fiction that would also deserve to win,  and Joaquin Phoenix should get best Actor regardless if it should win or lose best picture.  I was actually sympathetic to the Joker in the first half of the film before he masterfully transformed into the murderous villain that Batman fans have known for decades.

2. The Irishman -  this would have been better if it was produced as a mini-series instead of a three and a half hour film that used the same actors and formulas as Goodfellas and Casino.  In fact while watching it, I couldn't stop comparing it so many other gangster films that cast the same actors in similar role.   I enjoyed it, but is absolutely not the best picture. 

3. Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood  - another master piece by Quentin Tarantino.  I enjoyed it like I've enjoyed every film Tarantino has written and/or directed.  There are two things wrong with it.  It is paced out sluggishly to flesh out the characters and I found that it pandered to Hollywood old guard and modern day elite based on the time and setting and events it is based around.  I would not be unhappy that this would be the film for which Quintin finally wins a ""best picture"" Oscar for, but I'm not convinced it is actually the best picture released this year."

Basically, much of the of the anti-marijuana propaganda from the 20th century was based on junk science from research was done by some idiot who repeatedly strapped gas masks onto monkey's faces for an extended amount of time forcing them to only breath in Marijuana smoke.  Afterwards he observed their behavior after multiple regular sessions,  the monkeys were euthanized and dissected to reveal all kinds of organ damage. What he really did was torture those poor monkeys with regular smoke inhalation and oxygen deprivation  and then kill them to dissect their brains."

Slightly longer  Explanation:  Most soft tissues end up breaking down, bones themselves are have rigidity because of the mineral known as calcium but have loads of soft tissue inside of them that will break down and the empty spaces or pocket can fill with minerals.  As they sit in the ground  over millions of years minerals flow into and out of them, different minerals dissolve and form at different rates. After Millions of years so much of the fossil's original physical substance has been replaced in stages by minerals that slowly flow as sediment surround it turns to rock and is buried deep enough in the earth's crust.  Every area and layer of the crust is unique, with different long term conditions creating a wide variety of out comes by the time the fossil is found by humanity."
