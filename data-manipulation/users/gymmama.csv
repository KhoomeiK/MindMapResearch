I definitely found that killing the acne bacteria was key to preventing acne, opposed to waiting for acne to appear and then trying to kill active acne.
I don't have acne any more, but when I did, I would spritz my face a few times a day with liquid colloidal silver and it kills the p. acnes bacteria but doesn't harm your skin at all.  It was VERY effective for me!

SkincareAddiction,fgjrdo2,t1_fgjpz7o,1580849896.0,"So I am 42 now.  Since I was a teenager I had acne. Nothing horrible but I had it.
Then as an adult I had hormonal acne.  It was really bad during my pregnancies.
So, I did the only thing I thought I should do….scrub it away. Clean my face more and more.  Use harsher products to kill the bacteria.  More clay masks, more exfoliating, peels, acne creams, etc…
NEVER did I use moisturizers or SPF!  
And my skin was angry and red and raw and peeling and up close it looked scaly.  You could see every line.  It looked like it could crack open.  Like when you see a picture up close of dry mud and you see all the cracks…that’s what my face looked like.
I was so frustrated and tired of it.
I realized at about 38-39 years old that NOTHING I applied topically to my face was going to fix my acne.
Then one day I stumbled up something talking about moisture barriers, and how to tell if your skin is dehydrated.  This lead me down a wormhole of researching and reading anything I could about skin.  I learned that the moisture barrier is massively important for the health of our skin, and when you destroy it, your skin is so much more prone to acne and breakouts.  
THIS WAS ME!  My skin was OILY! So oily within minutes of washing it.  So I’d wash more.  I’d use more toners and other harsh products to dry up the oil.
One day I said NO MORE!
I began to treat my hormonal acne internally by taking DIM supplements, which I still take every single morning and probably never will quit.
And I began to treat my skin gentle and kind and quit using ALL harsh products.
I got really into Korean skincare.  I was obsessed with it.  I followed the 10 step process 2x a day, and I still do have a lot of Korean products and follow the 10-step process loosely.
I began using SPF 50 EVERY DAY rain or shine.
I used products designed to heal my moisture barrier. SO many products.  
So – there’s a lamp in my bathroom.  I prefer to just use that lamp for light at night as I am doing my skincare process, instead of the bright vanity lights.
The lamp sits in front of a mirror.  My skin used to look like a scaly wrinkly MESS in that lamp light.  As my skin was repairing, I’d always look at my face in that same lamp light and the difference was incredibly noticeable!
Smiling didn’t make my face look like it would crack anymore.  The smile lines were incredibly smoothed out.  My cheeks looked shiny – but in a HEALTHY, glowy way – not a dehydrated way.
And slowly but surely with my persistence and never ever not one day did I skip nourishing and pampering my face – my skin became NICE!
It’s healthy!  It has a glow!  It’s moisturized!  The discoloration from acne scars and melasma from 4 pregnancies is GONE!
The sun damage from never wearing sunscreen and being a sun worshiper, and living in Phoenix, GONE!  
It’s been over 2 years, maybe it’s been 27 months since I really began my skincare journey.
Now that my skin is wear I want it, I can tell you – the best products for me are Vitamin C and SPF every morning.  Niacinamide, an oil of some sort, and Stratia Liquid Gold at night.
Now I have a slew of products to use up that I really do like – but those are my powerhouse products that have reversed a lot of damage for me.
Sorry this is SO long!"
SkincareAddiction,fgj9ag4,t1_fgj8du7,1580839524.0,"I exfoliated very little and I stayed away from any clay masks or any actives.
I use lots of facial oils and my favorite moisturizer is Stratia Liquid Gold.  Most nights I would, and occasionally still do, top off my skincare with Aveeno Baby Eczema cream or some other thick occlusive to trap moisture from leaving my skin at night.
SLOWLY I would start to incorporate other things, like Vitamin C daily, under my SPF.
And then at night I began using Niacinamide also.
Maybe 1 or 2x a week, once I felt like my skin was much healthier and hydrated, I began using a 7% glycolic toner in the morning, but I’d rinse my face about an hour after applying it.
I steered clear of all BHA’s, AHA’s, peels, and exfoliating scrubs when my skin was repairing. 
It took a very long time, but my moisture barrier repaired."

I just maybe add 1/2 a dropper or a tad more than that into the mask.  I will only blend enough mask for one use.

They are the perfect colors for me to wear if I am going with pinks or peaches/nude color lip glosses (I'm more of a gloss girl than lipstick girl).  They also work great if you fill in your entire lip with them."
femalefashionadvice,ffuo5hd,t3_ev8mnq,1580246054.0,"I buy big, funky, boho earrings....fringe, tortoise shell,  macrame, feathers, etc... then even if my outfit looks basic, my earrings are eye-catching and can be the focal point.

Currently I am into comfy drawstring pants that can look dressed up if you pair them with heals and a fitted top, but after work I can put flip flops and a tee-shirt or sweatshirt on to lounge or run my kids around.

I also love thrifting because I'm not very inspired by anything in the stores now, and I like to shop a variety of styles and brands that I wouldn't find in the store.

My daughters have fun thrift shopping with me and creating their own look and style too instead of wearing what all the other girls are wearing."
CatsAreAssholes,ffuku9l,t3_ev8voy,1580244078.0,I had a large faux plant that I loved.  It sat on the floor. I had to put saran wrap around the entire bottom of it because my cat would not quit digging in the 'faux soil'.  His name is Tucker.  It rhymes with a word that is perfect to describe his mischievous naughty self.
Makeup,ffukoi2,t3_ev8zas,1580243981.0,"Mine is more about skincare.  I do a red LED light mask every morning for 15-20 minutes before I get out of bed (I set my alarm early, put my mask on, and go back to sleep).  Then when I get out of bed, hair goes up in a bun, and I slather squalane oil on my face and usually top with a moisturizing face mask.  I love the processes of keeping my skin healthy and hydrated for the day before I do my make-up."
AmateurRoomPorn,ffugy35,t3_euulc7,1580241724.0,"Bright, clean, eclectic, and has character.  I like it!"
slowcooking,ffuf2iz,t3_ev6g71,1580240609.0,"I am making this next weekend with some cornbread on the side.  Looks delish, easy, budget friendly, and can have leftovers for the kids' lunch thermoses.  Thank you for posting!"
30PlusSkinCare,ffub4gs,t1_ffuae1z,1580238265.0,"I believe they are mostly for excess estrogen but I'm not positive. 

They are safe pills to take, I'd say they are worth a try!  If they work they work! They've worked miracles for me and my acne was mostly chin cysts, occasional jaw.  I also carry weight in hips/butt/thighs (estrogen dominant trait)."
30PlusSkinCare,ffuar86,t1_fftxo16,1580238044.0,"You look great!  I'm 42 and finally have the skin I always wanted but I had years and years of being too harsh with my skin and it wasn't until 3 years ago I began nourishing my skin, protecting it, reversing damage, moisturizing like there's no tomorrow, etc... it works.  I have normal smile creases, but my wrinkle situation is very minimal compared to where I assume I would be if I hadn't changed my ways 3 years ago.  I'm very often told I don't look my age or asked if I have had Botox.  I haven't, and I'm not opposed to it, but it's not in the cards for now.  Keep it up!"
SkincareAddiction,ffua8sf,t3_ev8hhg,1580237739.0,"Sometimes I think to myself, ""I don't have a million products for my arm skin, so why so much for my face?""

I personally have so many products it's stupid, BUT, I have my routine narrowed down to which products are essential for me, give me results, fit in my budget, and are the products I will continue to re-buy.

Those include Niacinamide, Vitamin C serum, Stratia Liquid Gold, oils (I have many that I love), this hemp moisturizer I got from TJ Maxx that I LOVE for daily use, and Missha Sun Milk SPF 50.  Those are my essentials. 

I'll continue using up other products but maybe on my chest or hands or give to my mom, daughters, or friends."
SkincareAddicts,ffu86mb,t1_ffu66hv,1580236524.0,"I have the Acure Blue Tansy oil (I found at my local Target), and I also have 'The Yellow Bird' brand of Blue Tansy from Amazon.  I love both of them!  Very hydrating, I like the smell, and it just feels like a drink of nourishing water for my face.  I use it mixed it with my moisturizer at night because I like to be good n greasy before bed, but you can use it on it's own too."
Skincare_Addiction,ffu538z,t3_ev798h,1580234673.0,"I have liked everything I tried from Trader Joe's, however, if it's breaking you out, I'd quit using it and try a different oil.

You can always mix it with your body lotion and use it on your body and hands so it doesn't go to waste."
SkincareAddicts,ffu2qvu,t3_ev8h55,1580233237.0,"Stratia Liquid Gold.  I would slather my entire body in this if I could.

I personally love to mix it with an oil in my hands before I apply to my face and neck.  If your skin likes oils, I recommend squalane, Blue Tansy, or Stratia Fortify.  I can feel my skin drink it right up!"
cats,ffu2i4h,t3_ev5zfy,1580233086.0,"I just picture cats do a quick calculation, a little math or whatever to figure out exactly how much force and effort needs to go into the perfect jump to land a feat like that. Impressive!"
Instagramreality,fftk5uh,t3_euym22,1580222667.0,"I honestly feel like women that wear that much face makeup make them selves look so much worse than if they just lightened it up!  Let your skin show!  She has beautiful skin, there's no need to cake on such thick makeup. It only accentuates her pores."
AmateurRoomPorn,fftjykc,t3_euyk5z,1580222520.0,Love the chairs and the way you hung the paintings.  Picture perfect!  Pun intended.  White walls are great!  Gone are the days of needing to have a color on every wall.

AmateurRoomPorn,fft4sgz,t1_ffsjv1m,1580207108.0,"I love it! Very soft and vacuums well If you use the “thick carpet” setting. Also, we have a large family and 4 pets, but we don’t wear shoes in the house which I think has helped it stay clean."
AmateurRoomPorn,ffs2w2e,t1_ffs0i11,1580171798.0,"I may. I gathered up everything here from other spots in the house to be thrifty about it, but maybe when I find other cool items I’ll consider adding and going up. My husband loves bringing in the ladder for me all the time lol"
