SandersForPresident,fgkq8cl,t1_fgkq1h7,1580871201.0,"If you’re criticizing AOC, chances are you’re a republican, who support a bloated military budget, and the military is one of the biggest offenders of wasting money (eg, $5000 for a toilet seat).  So forgive me if I think your beliefs are inconsistent and you’re not a person who should be listened to."
SandersForPresident,fgkpxpj,t1_fgkomi8,1580871025.0,She seems pretty smart and level headed to me and our government spent over $800k to educate me so I must be sort of smart

mildlyinteresting,fghtirk,t1_fght6ei,1580793425.0,Hopefully joe is a more promising scientist than you.  People like you are the reason percentile ranks for funding are so low - some people just have shit ideas and don’t deserve funding.
mildlyinteresting,fght246,t1_fghsiho,1580793047.0,"You’re a dumb person who doesn’t even understand that lines left over from streaking are tears, and thus you grossly misinterpreted the person I was replying to’s comment.  You’re just dumb and nothing I can say will make you think otherwise."

shrooms,fghjgyl,t3_eya3hs,1580786204.0,"Shrooms bring the Dream world into your consciousness.  They are what you make it. If your procrastination problems are an issue for you, then you will likely confront it while tripping. The solution may require several trips though.  The first one will likely just be a cathartic “thank God there’s an antidote for my problems” feeling.

My recommendation is to start on a low dose, like 1g lemon Tek.  I’m perplexed why people want to “meet god” while tripping."
