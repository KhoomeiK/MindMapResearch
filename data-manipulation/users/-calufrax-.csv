AskReddit,fcol8ku,t1_fcok259,1577835052.0,I'd love to hear more about it on here.
AskReddit,fcokvlb,t1_fcok259,1577834793.0,Oh yeah?  I wish I knew someone who'd let out their perv side on me in public.
AskReddit,fcojwzd,t1_fcohmio,1577834093.0,"I went through some of your comments.  Wasn't offended, just turned on."
AskReddit,fcogwdb,t1_fcofa8i,1577831941.0,"I don't think that's toxic by itself, unless the opinions themselves are purposefully being expresses for the sole purpose of offending people.  I'm imagining you could have a very functional relationship with other tactless opinionated people.

Having personalities that clash a bit isn't toxicity.  If they're ostracizing you, and never brought up why, that's pretty toxic."
AskReddit,fcoenok,t1_fcnx6ho,1577830397.0,"People who know me seem to genuinely enjoy spending time with me.

He told me he doesn't initiate plans unless it's to ask someone on a date, so I've mostly been doing that.  I try to be supportive towards all his interests and hobbies, and offered to introduce him to people that could give him music connections (his hobby us writing music).

I try to be positive, but we're both probe to the occasional bout of depression.  I'm seeking treatment for that, he is not, although I encouraged him to.

He has been an empathetic ear at times, but his mood is up and down. So its sometimes unpredictable in terms of how he comes across."
AskReddit,fcoe598,t1_fcnzuvv,1577830036.0,How do you know?
AskReddit,fco7ked,t1_fco5olu,1577825607.0,"I guess my concerns are more about whether his comments have any validity, and if so, what can I do to prevent myself from falling into that behaviour unaware again.  

I've accepted his position will not change,  and have begun the process of moving on, but I'm not there yet.  I'm having some trust issues about the while thing.  Thanks for your comments, I appreciate it."
AskReddit,fcnz9jy,t1_fcnwdjx,1577821274.0,"How I treat him differs from how I treat my other friends, but that's also because he treats me differently than my other friends do.

He called me toxic and abusive after a heated argument, but I'm having trouble understanding how exactly I've acted that way.  I've expressed disappointment in some behaviour, and tried to explain how how those actions were upsetting,  but he's saying that I'm being abusive by making him feel badly about his actions, and that I should move on."
AmItheAsshole,fcnmqig,t3_ei3eco,1577814439.0,"NTA.  Also, these are not friends.  Find new friends and ditch these ones."
