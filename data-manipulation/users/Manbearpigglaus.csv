DotA2,fgk3b0z,t1_fgjsv5b,1580856597.0,"Probably because everyone HAS to share their “unique” game experience due to the patch in the form of bitching. Is it not enough one person has to say that the game is bad right now and everyone not piggyback on that conversation so everyone has to make their own post? The mods get it. the community gets it. the servers/games are shit right now, what the fuck does 1,000 people /1.3% of the community bitching on a small platform accomplish? If I were a mod I’d ban every shrieking moron that posted about the games right now just to clear the clutter that is this shit subreddit. You’re post and all those before it are getting nothing done, if you want something to actually happen to post on steam."

It’s the attention span of the players that are beginning to dwindle,praying for new patches to come every week just to add a little “spice” and it’s really valves fault. But you cannot expect them to adhere to a small group of weebs on a social platform who, legitimately, are the minority."
