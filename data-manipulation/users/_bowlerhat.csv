2. when it's raining-need to have at least a hat to protect it from raindrops.

3. when wearing a mask, it'll fog fast too.

but for me the most is when being intimate and they want you to take off your glasses....and you can't cause you're blind as a bat without them. 

the upside:

1. I forgot when the last time I had dust flying into my eyes.
