I have also seen multiple people be let go too. The rational way to handle it is definitely not to lose your temper, scream that you quit, and then verbally harass other people while making a scene on your way out. He chose the irrational way to act and it is his own fault. He also probably knew it was coming too, usually people who are poor workers see the signs and know. 

Now, if you were a large business owner like Walmart or Amazon or such, then you would be TA. Severance and unemployment for them are a drop in the bucket."

pics,fdl4w2m,t1_fdjmdle,1578517087.0,"I remember in 2008 (I was under 18, couldn’t vote) the Democrats were lambasting the Republicans for choosing McCain as the front runner because McCain was in his early 70s and had been on Capitol Hill for 25 years. Then they proceeded to choose Biden as the VP candidate, who at the time was in his mid 60’s and had been on Capitol Hill for 35 years. 

I could not believe the absolute hypocrisy of it. They hated McCain for being too old and for having been in the government for too long, yet they chose a running mate who was close to that same age and had been in government for a decade longer. Since then I am not as surprised since politics (on both sides) have gotten so much more ridiculous."

Nor would it be a seizure, as they would not be moving her if she was in the middle of a seizure (plus you can look at her and tell). Chronic illness, maybe, but not likely at all. Look at how they are dressed, see the cop waiting on them, and then listen to how the worker at the end tells them to get out. These people are drunk. The girl who is being carried out probably caused a scene and passed out. The dumb bitch going around trying to take people’s phones and yelling at them not to record is literally wearing a pair of panties or some type of jock strap on her face, she is clearly drunk. The guy carrying the passed out girl is clearly done with all this shit and just wants to get out of there.

MurderedByWords,fcu77wr,t1_fctrg1i,1577974212.0,"I would say Sanders’ run was very different from Klobuchar’s. Bernie barely missed out on the Democrat nomination, and that was due to tampering in the DNC to get Hillary to win. Bernie was nationally known and was a very prominent figure in the 2016 election. Meanwhile I had never heard of Klobuchar or even knew she was running until literally just now. Looks like she is currently polling at less than 4%, compared to Biden at 27, Sanders at 19, Warren at 16, and Buttigieg at 9. I’ll go ahead and say it, she has a 0% chance of winning."
