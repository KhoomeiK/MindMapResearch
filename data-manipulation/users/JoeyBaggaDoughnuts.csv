mildlyinteresting,ffuv36w,t1_fftcptt,1580249900.0,Are there such things as Japanese style pickles?
todayilearned,ffsahds,t1_ffs9wwt,1580177086.0,Got attacked by a “friend” of mine bc he was an alcoholic and didn’t know how to release his emotions. I held myself but he was bigger than me and definitely overpowered me. But I wanna gain weight through muscle and be able to fully defend myself when I need to. And when I’m stronger I’m more confident.
todayilearned,ffs52n6,t1_ffs4olb,1580173335.0,I am not what I eat
todayilearned,ffs1lyg,t1_ffs0lei,1580170920.0,Appreciate the advice. Guess I will be trying to find any way to put it into breakfast lunch and dinner.
todayilearned,ffs0orb,t1_ffrwcic,1580170291.0,"Got any recommendations for somewhat simple meals? Searching for a cookbook you still get loads of results, but maybe I’m just overthinking it."
todayilearned,ffs0l2j,t1_ffrxeem,1580170221.0,I’ve tried that diet and that doesn’t even work!
todayilearned,ffs0iun,t1_ffrvr3x,1580170177.0,It’s seriously like a full time job for someone who isn’t a “pro cook”
todayilearned,ffs0f3p,t1_ffrvbfw,1580170104.0,Don’t forget delicious!
todayilearned,ffrt6gx,t1_ffrqa4e,1580165276.0,"We have two different pasts, general info to me might seem non-understandable to you and vise versa. Finding high caloric meals in my budget range that are also healthy is quite hard when most people in America want to lose weight and foods are more catered to that aspect."
todayilearned,ffrp66l,t1_ffrl39z,1580162737.0,"I will have to try some avocado oil, haven't tried that before!"
todayilearned,ffrp297,t1_ffro3d8,1580162670.0,"You're right, trying to find new foods through google is a nightmare, or even recipes. There is so much misinformation I have to go to 4-5 sites just to create one meal that incorporates all food groups."
todayilearned,ffrjlqi,t1_ffrifgf,1580159350.0,It's also hard on the other end. Finding healthy meals with lots of calories to put on weight. The hardest part is just figuring out what would be healthy and then actually eating how much you should eat.
todayilearned,ffrjh35,t1_ffrdc2u,1580159273.0,"Spot on, I feel the main starting point is the ingredients that most people deem healthy when they in fact are not healthy."
FixedGearBicycle,ffrduo4,t3_eup52x,1580156055.0,Nothing gets the day going better than that
mildlyinfuriating,ffqngy3,t1_ffpta16,1580139214.0,This is a set up video
FixedGearBicycle,ffqmtsy,t1_ffqfl6r,1580138765.0,I opted for Andel over All City's when I was getting mine due to the differences in color. But the Andel's are amazing and so much sturdier than my last ones.

Showerthoughts,ffmphby,t1_ffk1tun,1580057554.0,"It’s great for the last two sandwiches, just throw them in the middle and make two triple deckers."
TikTokCringe,ffmp02v,t3_etzw4z,1580057397.0,4 strong fighters
WinStupidPrizes,ffmd3is,t3_etyi6e,1580052657.0,The fact Du Haas is playing over this makes it 10 times more exciting
apexlegends,ffmcoza,t3_etv2dl,1580052452.0,Do people actually pay for this stuff?
AdviceAnimals,ffmca90,t1_ffm2lpk,1580052301.0,"Everyone’s in the gallows for something, it just helps people connect."
AdviceAnimals,ffmc4jk,t3_etwfxi,1580052202.0,This reminds me of when the swine flu was around and there was a remix to “blame it” which was saying blame the Mexicans really. The song was funny but it was funnier when a Mexican dude beat up this black dude for singing it in class. Damn good times
JusticeServed,ffma7bp,t3_etvv6t,1580051318.0,That rhino will have a sore ass neck tomorrow
