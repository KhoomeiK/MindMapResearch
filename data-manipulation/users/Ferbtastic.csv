The chef is going to cook and serve as much as he can from that cow. A chef isn’t going to serve someone a bad cut that they wouldn’t otherwise sell just because it’s ordered well done, but most good chefs will prioritize better cuts for rarer orders where possible as it will greatly improve one guests experience at a marginal loss to another customer.

I have 100% come across mansplaning in the legal field. remember, Reddit is a bunch of young men, sure we might “mansplain” on occasion but we aren’t the target that is being insulted. I have seen 60 year old white male attorney that describes female attorneys as lawyerettes. I have seen legal opinion letters to client that say “we have a good chance of winning because their attorney is a female and so she doesn’t know the law as well as she thinks she does.”

Whether it’s a fair word to describe your or my actions is a fair discussion. Whether the word is over used and has become a sword rather than a shield is a fair discussion. But to say the word doesn’t have a place is disingenuous to the regular every day sexism women face, especially in many careers."
Overwatch,feqpu2e,t3_eqdwts,1579344622.0,"If other players didn’t lose SR it would cause two problems.

1) people in group, or at higher ranks people that know each other but are not in group, may leave games intentionally so that a teammate retains SR. (Think people trying to bring a friend to GM or too 500).

2) Teammates May harass players to get them to leave so that they will retain SR. This will increase toxicity.

As it stands now it 100% sucks to lose SR from someone else leaving a game. But over time it should actually increase your SR as the other team has leavers as well. You always have a chance one of your 5 teammates will leave but there are 6 opponents and thus more chance they have a leaver. So over time if you aren’t ever leaving games your opponents should have a leaver more often than you do."
