It can get cheaper and easier in the future. They're still fine-tuning the algorithm itself right now. So the results are better and better.

> Random stray thoughts... What about an on-card training that could work with any game ? Like the GPU actually gets better and better the longer you play the game ?

The card doesn't know what you're supposed to get. The way they do it now is train the algorithm on extremely high resolution images, so DLSS can sometimes get more detail than native resolution. But that's very resource-intensive, so I don't see it happening in real time while you're playing the game. 

> The parallel that comes to mind is how Google's speech recognition initially (and for many years) required the processing to be done by Google's servers.

So it's trial and error - unless you can find the specifications for the panel used in your monitor, and set the timings accordingly.

Personally, I'd just leave it at 160Hz - it's more than enough for smooth motion, and if your CPU can't sustain 160fps, you'll just have more stuttering above 160Hz."
