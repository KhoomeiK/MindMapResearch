coolguides,ffee06t,t1_ffdlp22,1579844518.0,"Steak tartare is handled so much differently than ground beef for burgers. Ordering rare burgers is just a bad idea. The reason a rare steak is fine is because bacteria is typically isolated to the areas of the meat that is exposed to air, hence the interior is fine. In steak tartare, the meat is carefully prepared just before it comes to your table leaving minimal time for exposure. Think of it like ordering puffer fish at a sushi place...it can literally kill you if you order it somewhere you shouldn’t. Burgers come from ground beef, which has plenty of time to accumulate all the lovely toilet plague viruses before being forming into a patty and cooked. So, no, you should absolutely not order a burger rare unless you happen to be a place where you are 100% certain they are super extra careful I food handling and grind their beef right before they cook it. Honestly, unless I literally worked in the restaurant, I wouldn’t trust it."

I’m just saying I don’t think that’s a good decision and lacks a certain amount of awareness about what you’re putting out into the world, even if your intent wasn’t racist."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffb7emi,t1_ffb6idt,1579753859.0,"Yeah, even OP says calls it “mildly racist” and I sure as fuck wouldn’t post that pic, but I’m not sure if it’s intentional or just cringey as fuck. I don’t think if this is FWR material, it’s really just a poorly constructed extension of the r/tinder trope where women only want tall dudes. And there is nothing wrong with people having preferences, but people do put some fairly crazy shit in their tinder profiles that approach the level of this meme.

This probably should have occurred to me before, but if this came from r/memes, isn’t it possible a black dude made the meme as a joke about his experiences in online dating? If so, it would be pretty hard to declare it racist for a black dude to choose this hair. Actually, it might be a little racist to assume black dudes don’t have experiences they might choose to make memes about...but now I’m hurting my own brain so I won’t go down that rabbit hole."

aww,fdtyhpb,t1_fdtp300,1578724321.0,"Sorry, I may be conflating discussions a bit. I’m also discussing whether it was the predominant hunting strategy for early humans in another part of this thread. I’m not trying to say this absolutely cannot be used as a method of subsistence in some limited circumstances, but it is highly unlikely that it could be used so widely that it affected the course of our evolution."
aww,fdtrrgq,t1_fdtngiq,1578721180.0,"It is an interesting theory, but it’s based entirely on reverse engineering our evolution. The evidence we do have from [archaeological data]( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248407001327) suggests we were taking animals in prime adulthood, which one would not expect from persistence hunting. This points to ambush hunting. Also, persistence hunting only works in a climate where your prey will reach exhaustion, where your prey cannot simply hide, and where the ground will allow tracking. I don’t think we can completely discount the idea and it would certainly be a viable strategy under ideal conditions, but I don’t find the argument convincing."
aww,fdtchid,t1_fdsmq95,1578714799.0,"The Vet checks make sense since the horse can’t stop and tell you if there is a problem.

aww,fdskgly,t1_fdsay0q,1578704312.0,"While a human can outrun a horse over distance, there is actually an annual [Man versus Horse Marathon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_versus_Horse_Marathon) that is, like so many great things in this world, the result of a drunken argument over whether man is faster than horse over distance. Since 1980, a human has won twice, every other time it has been won by a horse. Of course, if we go back to Persistence Hunting, this is admittedly not really a fair test since horses are actually pretty good at endurance running compared to animals we might choose to hunt."
aww,fdsisi3,t1_fdrzsux,1578703552.0,"There is not a lot of evidence to support the theory of early humans engaging in Persistence Hunting. It is a cool theory, but outside of ideal circumstances, it’s not a very reliable way to hunt. There have been elite ultra marathoners that attempted it and failed. Even bottom-of-the-gene-pool humans have pretty amazing brains when compared to other animals. This brain power means early humans would have been much better as ambush predators. Any asshole with a pointy stick can learn to put dinner on the the table this way, and that’s how a species survives."
