Vancouver seattle is a ""3 hr drive"" .... it routinely takes me almost 5 due to the shitty seattle traffic. And no, ""then it's a 5 hr drive"" is not a correct smartass follow up, because the drive time is generally reported based on distance and EXPECTED average speed."
Justrolledintotheshop,ffchr02,t1_ffcgrnt,1579799725.0,Yup. Exactly. Especially with the high speed highways in Europe.

Watches,ff837z9,t3_erygec,1579664796.0,"Stupid. Everyone has different priorities and tastes. Some people are millionaires and wont spend a dime on a watch because they see no point in having something when the phone tells them the time. Some people refuse to spend more than $200 on a watch and prefer to own more of them than just a handful of expensive ones.

Buy a watch you like, in the price range you've set out for yourself. Dont follow someone elses example. For all you know that guy has a $20,000 Rolex and eats ramen every night as a result."

Last but not least, in Europe they run 2 axles on truck and 3 on trailer. In USA they run 3 on truck and 2 on trailer .... so the total number of axles is exactly the same!"

Justrolledintotheshop,ff1t02s,t1_ff1si7e,1579485511.0,A large diesel is a whole different ball game. And I doubt you got 1 million miles out of a modern cummins with EGR and DPF and everything else restricting motor life for the sake of emissions.
Justrolledintotheshop,ff1ryrz,t1_ff1pw78,1579484858.0,"Very, very few people keep a high end car long enough for that to be an issue anymore. Who do you know that has a diesel porsche with 400,000km on it? Most people owning high end cars tend to own them for a few years only then switch to something newer. 

And with the new emissions requirements on diesel, I seriously doubt that is true anymore. With so much additional emissions equipment and with the EGR slowly choking every diesel to death, I have a hard time believing any modern diesels, in stock form, are getting up to 4-500,000 km without significant repairs along the way"

Justrolledintotheshop,feu2h82,t1_fetuq0q,1579382481.0,Hmmm so how are they pulling that kind of weight with 1 axle in the back whereas all USA trucks need 2? Do you know the reasoning behind this? Seems cheaper to build and run 1 so if the euro trucks can do it why wouldn't the Americans adopt the same?

Or do you mean the power divider is actually powering both axles normally but locking it in locks the power 50-50 like a diff lock would?"
