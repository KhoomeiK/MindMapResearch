SebDerm,fdfntbb,t3_ekzda6,1578365989.0,"I’d recommend Krave Oat So Simple Water Cream !!! 

I’ve been struggling for years trying to find a safe moisturizer.. I’m sensitive to glycerin, silicones, fatty alcohols, acids..  but this water cream only has 10 ingredients and so far, it hasn’t caused any flare ups or break outs.  It’s been about 3 months. Sometimes I add a few drops of squalane for extra moisture. You should check it out :)"
