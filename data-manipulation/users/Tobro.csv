Christianity,ffvzj33,t3_evi3u4,1580278312.0,Did you ask your parents if they thought that was a good idea? What do they have to say about it?
Christianity,ffvzak2,t3_evig2f,1580278071.0,"You are 19. You need to have counseling with your father or move out. You are an adult. The boundaries between parents and their children are supposed to change when the child reaches adulthood. I don't mean you get to disrespect your father, or disobey him, but he needs a lesson from someone more mature then he is in how to deal with this transition. He is not your heavenly Father, he is your earthly Father, and he isn't sinless.

I would also take a deep look into the scripture about Christian liberty. I hear a lot of legalism going on. A lot of relying on human will and works rather than faith and Jesus. I don't think your father is a ""covert narcissist"", it sounds like he's a narcissistic control freak. That kind of behavior almost always backfires too. You (or your siblings) will most likely rebel one day.... and the harder the control freak, the greater the rebellion often is. I pray you can somehow leave your household, yet maintain a relationship with him, but I know the hard line Millerites can take in regards to people abandoning their fellowship.

Jesus brought freedom to his people. Freedom from the penalty and guilt of sin, and eventual freedom from all sin through physical death. All things are clean. All things are lawful. God's grace is sufficient for you and no matter how hard you work, or how many times you read the Bible, none of those works will merit your entry into his heavenly kingdom. Only the blood of Jesus can do that, and he already shed it for you. So believe in Jesus and follow him. Free yourself from the yoke of any enslavement save that of Jesus Christ.

God bless you. Many are praying for you."

Strange notion for a Marxist to adopt as no one but those in power had any freedom under Marxism.

>China has already become unsustainable due to improved conditions

By unstable, I guess you mean rich. Tens of millions died under Mao's Marxist policies. Their economy was stagnant until they opened their markets. Now they are rich. You would have to be a mentally ill to think China isn't economically better off since they opened their markets to investment and profit seeking.

> This isn't benevolence lifting anyone out of poverty.

No. It's profit seeking lifting people out of poverty.

>That aside, it's ridiculous to say that because capitalism has had a side-effect of occasionally lifting up some people...

That is a ridiculous thing to say, because it's a lie. It's not a ""side-effect""... it's the main effect. People exploiting each other through voluntary exchange is the reason we aren't all serfs.

I guess you just won't be happy until we are all equally dead in a ditch. Because that's what Marxism and forced ""equality of outcome"" get you... all for the sake of envy... because it's so painful to watch some guy enjoy his yacht.

By the way: explain to me why economic equality is somehow a necessity throughout society but not aesthetic equality? Why are some people allowed to be more beautiful than other people? Why are some people allowed to walk while others are born with no legs? Why are some born retarded (like you) while others benefit mentally by the luck of the draw? Why do some get to be privileged and white while others suffer racism? Seriously... how ""equal"" do you want us to get? Why so focused on money? There are so many ways we can force individuals to be more equal to one another. I'll tell you: Because it's easy to exploit people's labor by force when you own a military and the guns. Easy until they simply stop working, which is exactly what happened in every Marxist ""utopia"" that was ever tried (including the Pilgrims). That's the big sham: Accusing capitalists of exploiting people's labor when you are so willing to exploit those who have capital with weapons aimed at their heads. Hypocrisy at its finest."

No. If the system creates a super rich class, but at the same time brings the bottom higher than they've ever been, why is that a bad thing?"
bestof,ffuxy0b,t1_ffucpbk,1580251466.0,">It put its own profitability above the health of the community around it.

Another way to put that is that DuPont put profits above the personal and property rights of individuals. The community is just a bunch of individuals. There is no reason to turn it into Socialist propaganda. We don't want to put the community before the individual... we want to respect every individual's rights of liberty, property, and person.

>Somewhere in the past 50 or 60 years, America shifted to thinking that doing something to make yourself wealthier, at the expense of anyone (or everyone) else, makes you smart and savvy in most situations.

The difference between the past 50 years and the ""long, long, time ago"" isn't people's mindsets or schemes. There was just as much exploitation in the 1800s (or vastly more given slavery). The difference is that now scheming and plundering has become legal due to lobbying and corporatism. When the judiciary allowed the federal government vastly different powers than prescribed in the Constitution over the economy and general way of life of the individual American, government became so intertwined with business, they are nearly indistinguishable. The corporations fund politicians with money, and the politicians return favors with laws/regulations that favor them. More governmental power is the problem, not less. If the judiciary could simple hear cases of harm that individuals can levy against business that cause damage against them, and rule fairly, we don't need laws to protect people. Judges and juries are meant to protect people. Now, a crime is committed by DuPont, the government collects millions in fines and fees, and the people harmed get nothing, or worse, a pittance while class action lawyers get rich.

Fix the judiciary, restore the intent of the Constitution and prosperity and accountability can return."

That's ""progressivism"" for you. Debate is over. Progressives win simply by saying their opinion.

Let me reword his little diatribe with a little twist:

American Conservatives, driven by a rule-of-law mindset, and having been exposed to 30 years of constant left wing propaganda (yet managing to shield themselves from the onslaught), believe that liberalism is an opposing ideological viewpoint, that manifests itself as a crusade literally bent on destroying the established American way of life as constructed in the constitution by the founders of the country. Their minds see threats at every door: Public education, higher education, Mass Media, Television shows, the ballot box, the border, international trade deals, international aid deals, the Judiciary, etc. Illegal Immigrants taking their jobs, raping their daughters, and drugging the nation. Government taking their freedoms and their money. Gays stealing their religious traditions and indoctrinating their children. To them, none of these things are a byproduct of a progressive society that would merely elevate others to enjoy the same benefits they enjoy. Rather, they see a thieving government and under class in the cities who don't understand their principals or way of life. 

What’s worse, they see it as a plot not in favor of equality, but purposefully aimed at destroying their way of life. They perceive enemies around every corner because they have infiltrated every corner. The indoctrination starts in pre-school and goes into Doctoral degrees, where if education doesn't have a progressive agenda, then it's not education at all. They are taught that it isn't results of a policy or viewpoint that matters, it's only intention regardless of outcome. Equality now means equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity. Intersectionality is a prescription for victim-hood, and group identity is paramount. All struggles and persecutions are a result of all the religious right's ancient and barbaric institutions that must be sequestered to the size of the family, and even that should be eventually squashed and dismantled.

Trump is the first non-politician President in decades who seems to want to actually promote America as a land of integrity and prosperity, and so his followers respect him in spite of his terrible failings as a person. It doesn’t matter that his personal life runs contrary to every value they claim to hold dear. It doesn’t matter that he clearly lacks the skills, knowledge, or interest to actually carry out his promises. It matters that he wants America first. He wants to protect traditional America's borders, money, and interests. He wants to fill the courts, deep state, and bureaucracies with conservative minds where there hasn't been any even slightly right leaning people since their inception.

To the 5 of you who read this before it's downvoted and gone, don't be guilty of what this person accuses his enemies of doing. Don't see your enemies as mindless monsters without a shred of integrity, honor, or good intentions. Look for that log in your own eye before looking for the splinter in your neighbor's. I know not all liberals are ""out to destroy me"". I know we are more polarized in anonymous chat rooms where we don't have to be held accountable to anyone for our words. Our ""enemies"" can be wicked, but they aren't demons. People can be terrible, but by in large we are most concerned with those most important things that are in front of us on a daily basis.
