Stronglifts5x5,ffdmxfh,t1_ffdexz3,1579824296.0,Possibly. He does trained Romanian deadlifts so there’s a good chance his standard deadlift weight is solid given his size and the fact he’s a juicy boy. Nothing on Geralt of course but still.
offmychest,ffdmsao,t3_et1ljc,1579824208.0,Minimise contact. Have a life. Surround yourself with other people. Basically just spend time doing your own thing. Abandon hope of being together. It won’t happen. In time you’ll find someone who feels the same way and trust me it will be way better. This will become a memory.
offmychest,ffdmfrs,t3_et1w1p,1579823998.0,Might be an unpopular opinion but sounds like she got what she deserved. If you get warned and then decide to pull a knife on someone you deserve to get laid out. Man or woman. Sounds like a nutcase.
witcher,ffdgauk,t1_ffdfmil,1579820262.0,"And I’m pointing out it’s wrong. If you visit the emperor. Refuse the money. Win the war for Nilfgaard and have Ciri live she doesn’t become a Witcher. It said “then she’ll become a Witcher if she comes back.” That statement is false. Nowhere did it say that it “puts her on the path.” It says in black and white. “If not taken, then she’ll become a Witcher if she comes back.” She only becomes a Witcher if you refuse money and have her survive if you ensure Nilfgaard loses the war."
Stronglifts5x5,ffdet6l,t1_ffdek5h,1579819371.0,Yeah I get that. For me especially if I can imagine the scene that song plays in too. Shame Geralt never deadlifted in the Witcher. Season 2 maybe? Besides your deadlift is pretty solid. Most of the population can’t even deadlift 200 pounds. The bar is pretty low but still. Maybe if they picked the bar up once in a while it would be higher.

Stronglifts5x5,ffdcn1y,t3_epsdgp,1579818054.0,Don’t care about the lift. I love that you work out to Toss A Coin To Your Witcher. Did back and shoulders the other day listening to it on loop.

offmychest,ff8w5al,t1_ff8hq2m,1579698078.0,Uhhhh what? No. Doesnâ€™t suddenly mean you own the person.
R6ProLeague,ff7cmfg,t3_eryjrz,1579646440.0,Poor Goga is only the second best Goga.
shittyrainbow6,ff3wp09,t3_ercsn0,1579550495.0,Hey... I get results alright. Itâ€™s honest work.
nattyorjuice,ff3wlt0,t1_ff3jer9,1579550439.0,My 14 year old brother has stretch marks on his arms from 2 months of casual lifting/puberty. They donâ€™t mean anything my dude. Most people I know have them
Fitness,ff1bxt2,t1_ff1bcv5,1579477308.0,I donâ€™t know how the fuck he did that. I tried to do one and I couldnâ€™t even get it into position without help.
Fitness,ff1afgk,t1_ff1a76s,1579476847.0,Does being a farmer make a huge difference then? I always figured he was strong at what he did but it wouldnâ€™t translate over to weight work. I guess that was pretty dumb of me.
nattyorjuice,ff0u71e,t1_ff0sgkn,1579472361.0,If weâ€™re being technical heâ€™s about 165. He actually had to put on weight to make weight rather than the norm of dropping.
nattyorjuice,femu1ye,t1_fekt5uu,1579269594.0,Fuckkkk. I wish I knew this years ago.
gaming,feh0dtr,t1_fegwa9b,1579106504.0,I think theyâ€™re referring to the Skellige shipwreck but thatâ€™s made me think. Damn Geralt just needs to stay off ships.
skulduggerypleasant,fegzsl1,t1_fegximx,1579106148.0,The first part is painfully true. I mind my own business and I get tiny dude trying to start stuff to look like hot shit in front of their girlfriends. Itâ€™s really annoying. Especially if Iâ€™m with people.
nattyorjuice,feg50f2,t3_eozmup,1579077201.0,Nahhhh heâ€™s totally natural. I bet he doesnâ€™t even work out.
witcher,fedyv62,t3_eomg2h,1579022790.0,I killed him on my latest playthrough. I just didnâ€™t want to get the paint as Iâ€™m going for another plat trophy run and Iâ€™m lazy.
witcher,fedym2i,t1_fedlelx,1579022640.0,HIM... HIM!!! SEXIST!!!! She is a her! I have never been so offended. Excuse me while I go off and cry in my safe space in front of a photo of Obama.
nattyorjuice,fedyg7w,t1_fedfsam,1579022541.0,He probably doesnâ€™t even lift. Just good genetics. Obviously.
unpopularopinion,fedoyx5,t1_fedonjm,1579016739.0,Fair enough. I donâ€™t agree but I see where youâ€™re coming from. Definitely agree with you about TFA. Honestly Star Wars Peaked with the Clone Wars and then fell off when they first cancelled it. This new trilogy is so mehh and the last one was only good in the last parts of the third film. Canâ€™t wait for the next trilogy where it turns out Darth Vader just needed a recharge and heâ€™s happily living out his days with his Toydarian wife and Wookie mistress until one day the evil Disney come along with their original ideas and come up with a... Another super weapon spacestation... never mind.
unpopularopinion,fedobci,t1_fedo5vz,1579016324.0,Wasnâ€™t as good as the Dark Knight true. Weird cuts and lack of co ordination made it weird to follow at times. Wouldnâ€™t say it was garbage though itâ€™s still a decent movie if films like that are your kinda thing.
unpopularopinion,fedo89c,t1_fedo3g7,1579016269.0,That scene was great. Still not sure how Bane killed him. Looked like he face hugged/tickled him to death.
gameswap,fedo26p,t3_eogynt,1579016162.0,I have a spare PS account with a digital copy of fallout 4. Itâ€™s never used so you could have it for free honestly
unpopularopinion,fednelp,t1_fednbo8,1579015743.0,This is r/unpopularopinion. Not expecting people to agree. Course instead I get downvotedðŸ˜‚
nattyorjuice,fedmyli,t1_fedirfy,1579015453.0,Try six hours. I tried this miracle ab workout from www.scam4abs.com and I became the Rock in just 10 minutes. Doctors everywhere are shocked by my transformation! Click here to see my dramatic change!
unpopularopinion,fedmthb,t1_fedmori,1579015360.0,For you...
unpopularopinion,fedmn3d,t1_fedmira,1579015241.0,"I was born with this opinion. Moulded by it. I didnâ€™t see the Dark Knight until I was already a man and by then it was nothing to me but... Blinding!!!


Oh wait my TV brightness was just too high. My bad."
nattyorjuice,feczcpj,t3_eoim0n,1578990983.0,Heâ€™s not that big and just has decently defined abs when flexing. If this is juicy then I donâ€™t know anymore.
Rainbow6,fecvlfk,t1_feb5fps,1578986366.0,4 month seasons maybe? God I hope not.
witcher,fecvhkt,t1_febtbf8,1578986249.0,You donâ€™t need to fight the Bandits you can choose to leave them. Also you can just ride off instead of fighting the giant.
witcher,fe8mf77,t3_enxn0z,1578927909.0,Get those numbers up. Thems are rookie numbers.
nattyorjuice,fe8ldvx,t1_fe4hu66,1578927501.0,I bet â€œyouâ€™reâ€ fun at spelling bees.
offmychest,fe1bxz6,t3_enknog,1578824782.0,You can wear what you like. Him following you around isnâ€™t your fault. Heâ€™s a creep.
gaming,fdvbsho,t1_fdus773,1578745795.0,If I canâ€™t insert an entire orchestra into my PS5 Iâ€™m not buying it.
nattyorjuice,fdofvl2,t1_fdo030y,1578604312.0,Thatâ€™s the kinda cut I want.
GodofWar,fdg0fnw,t1_fdg0ccj,1578375546.0,Gud git.
GodofWar,fdg0eo0,t1_fdg0bfq,1578375521.0,Nah. I called this account throwaway but I ended up using it as my main account. Not bait. Also not scared of â€œbacklashâ€ Oh no I might lose a few numbers on a screen that mean nothing. Go ahead and downvote me.
GodofWar,fdg0a2a,t1_fdg07kt,1578375403.0,I killed her first time. My issue is the awful design behind the fight. It honestly lowered my opinion of the game a lot. She spends 90% of her time in the air and every attack I threw I got tackled.
nattyorjuice,fdg0004,t1_fdfpvl1,1578375141.0,Thatâ€™s him. Heâ€™s admitted to taking gear. I donâ€™t know what heâ€™s trying to pull by posting himself claiming to be natty and not him. Pretty sad.
nattyorjuice,fdfztj1,t3_el4s3g,1578374977.0,"First off. Quit pretending this isnâ€™t you. Your last post shows the same guy and you say itâ€™s you. Secondly youâ€™re 5,5. You arenâ€™t the biggest thing in anything. You also said you take gear so quit lying. Did you stand on a stool to take that  photo? It honestly looks like you did."
nattyorjuice,fdfzk8a,t1_fdft2rd,1578374742.0,Disgusting... How could he.
MonsterHunterWorld,fdfz2ff,t1_fdfij44,1578374296.0,Youâ€™re talking to a bot.
nattyorjuice,fdd4xgq,t1_fdd4d34,1578294962.0,Naturally... Oh wait.
nattyorjuice,fcveur8,t1_fcvd3ji,1578000626.0,You said (little over half that) when talking about 300 pounds. Last I checked 30 pounds of lean mass is not little. So sorry I hurt your little feelings buddy. Itâ€™s okay Iâ€™m sure you can bench press my house while doing my mom or something Iâ€™m very intimated. You are truly the alpha male of alpha males while I just am a sad little breathing mouth hoping for food.
nattyorjuice,fcuwwv5,t3_eio8y6,1577990173.0,Pretty clearly natural. He just grew up. Unless he started lifting like 6 months ago.
nattyorjuice,fcuwi17,t1_fcuuyeh,1577989948.0,Congrats. You sent a link saying Cavill took roids. Something that we knew. Heâ€™s clearly not fat probably around 12-15% body fat and the guy is built which takes way more work than only being 150LB after a cutðŸ˜‚But congrats. You weigh as much as my 14 year old brother.
witcher,fcp8qmx,t3_ei5dfo,1577854274.0,I tried it. Was one second early. Fuck...

offmychest,fcldavv,t3_ehs32p,1577745153.0,Whatever they say they are you have a right to be attracted or not attracted to them. You were raped. The fact the you said you couldnâ€™t say no proves that. Saying no should always be an option. Iâ€™m so sorry you went through this. Youâ€™re absolutely not transphobic youâ€™re a lesbian and attracted to women. Not people with male bodies. Thatâ€™s fine and anyone who tries to guilt you into thinking otherwise is absolutely wrong.
GodofWar,fcl083a,t1_fckk7oy,1577736980.0,I play plenty of RPGs. I just donâ€™t enjoy staring at uninspired puzzles again and again. Itâ€™s my main issue with the game. I like the game. Itâ€™s for me I just donâ€™t like that one part of it.
GodofWar,fckyha7,t1_fckxri1,1577735904.0,Kratos took Captain Americaâ€™s quote seriously. He quite literally walks off Death whenever he dies in the original games. Heâ€™ll be fine.
GodofWar,fci2jxy,t1_fci2hvo,1577656982.0,Oh God... Of War
GodofWar,fci0wio,t1_fchydb9,1577656435.0,You were right. Thanks for talking me into continuing. It got a lot better :)
GodofWar,fchtdaj,t1_fchspie,1577653896.0,3-5 later depending on pace I think. Iâ€™d say stick with it. The puzzles are easy but tedious so I just use google to skip them. I really wasnâ€™t enjoying it but Iâ€™ve finally started getting some of the cool perks and skills and it makes it so much cooler.
witcher,fc1dj90,t1_fc1dfni,1577315531.0,Clearly you are missing the point. I didnâ€™t mention the books nor did I act like the only fan. You claim to have got both the book and the game as a Christmas present. Then you say you had the game already and got the DLC for Christmas. Thatâ€™s not possible. The DLC is included with the switch version of the game.
witcher,fc1d56m,t1_fc1d0x5,1577315199.0,The DLC comes with the Witcher for the switch. Itâ€™s not an optional extra. Quit lying.
witcher,fc1bxjp,t1_fc15pft,1577314174.0,It sucks.... That they didnâ€™t make a third expansion pack.
witcher,fc1boo9,t1_fc1bl0e,1577313962.0,He said he got them both for Christmas. Even if heâ€™s an experienced player he couldnâ€™t have gotten to the final DLC mission in a few hours. I donâ€™t know why youâ€™re defending the guy heâ€™s clearly just made this post for upvotes without putting much thought into it.
witcher,fc1bgqq,t1_fc1avr1,1577313777.0,I do. However thereâ€™s no way he got to the second to last mission in the main DLC in a few hours. Also why would a new player who just got the game skip the main game and go straight to the DLC.
witcher,fc13p1s,t1_fc0li7b,1577307362.0,Patience.
witcher,fc13oc3,t3_efgzry,1577307348.0,You got it for Christmas yet youâ€™re on one of the last missions for the final DLC? Mmmmm. Totally not fishing for upvotes.
Rainbow6,fc13dim,t1_fbzsdb3,1577307098.0,Warden is the best fragger in the game. You just need to channel your inner copper and youâ€™ll destroy everyone. I have a 3.0 kd with him and 800 odd kills. I just play like a fucking moron and probably 7-8 times outta 10 it pays off. Itâ€™s a warden thing I guess.
GodofWar,fc00mgb,t1_fbzvh10,1577272210.0,Spider-Man PS4 is absolutely repetitive. My guess is either GOW isnâ€™t my kinda game or I need to stick it out more. I appreciate the response. Merry Christmas!
