AskReddit,fgt5l4z,t1_fgs3lid,1581099521.0,What baffles me is that they now are able to make them so small that the laws of physics almost makes it impossible to shrink them further.
AskReddit,fgt3na9,t1_fgsa6cf,1581098361.0,I guess r/askreddit is a toddler that somehow got into the party and goes around asking people a bunch of random questions.

airsoft,fgt2prb,t1_fgt2g6r,1581097806.0,"I've never really had any issues with oxidation with my brass cylinders, the silicone grease in the cylinder does protect it. I guess my steel cylinders leave less residue than my brass cylinders, but there's still residue in them after a season of use.

I do use steel cylinders in high power setups where I need the extra weight from an alu piston head. I always use plastic piston heads otherwise to reduce the wear on the cylinder."
Showerthoughts,fgt1380,t3_f0bftc,1581096838.0,"In the sci-fi series ""Babylon 5"" the alien race ""Minbari"" have a saying that we are the universe trying to understand itself."
AskReddit,fgt0xlf,t1_fgsr36h,1581096746.0,"We have the same translation in Norway for racoon and porcupine. Ladybug is ""marihøne"" in Norwegian, or ""mary hen""."
airsoft,fgt04r3,t1_fgsuwmw,1581096273.0,What's wrong with brass cylinders? I actually prefer brass cylinders because they can be polished extremely smooth so you get excellent airseal and minimal friction.
airsoft,fgssn8k,t3_f0chv7,1581091811.0,That cylinder should probably work well for a 363mm barrel if you're not gonna use particularly heavy BB's. Why exactly can't you use the stock cylinder?
AskReddit,fgsgktb,t1_fgsggkw,1581083749.0,"Maybe not aim for multiplayer at first then. Should be technically possible, but will probably pose some challenges.

They could maybe do what they did with Eve Online to cope with the huge battles there. They use time dilation or whatever it's called to sync it all up."

AskReddit,fgsbkzp,t1_fgrarkv,1581079558.0,"I'm guessing it'll take less bandwidth than expected as you'd just have to transfer coordinates and simple instructions. We're talking just a few lines of code for each unit.

Online gaming doesn't interest me much these days though."
AskReddit,fgsbfce,t1_fgs42a3,1581079412.0,"Gave it a try, not a bad game, but it kinda feels like the ""kid version"" of Metal Fatigue."
AskReddit,fgsbbki,t1_fgr9xln,1581079312.0,I usually ended up spamming nukes in Generals playing as China.
airsoft,fgr3my1,t1_fgr2uiu,1581037394.0,This guy speaks the truth. The main point of airsoft is to have fun.

AskReddit,fgqu5d4,t1_fgqslun,1581031552.0,"Let's cross our fingers, maybe the RTS genre can get a renaissance."
AskReddit,fgqfh6k,t1_fgpw83n,1581023170.0,"Well, with the powerful CPU's and GPU's we have today they could make pretty impressive RTS games. It seems like FPS, RPG and MMO games are more prioritized these days though.

Imagine a new Age of Empires with literally thousands of units on screen, catapults and arrows with realistic ballistics, more advanced AI, all rendered in shiny DX12 graphics."

airsoft,fgoyedp,t1_fgoyc4i,1580991773.0,"Their motors have also had kinda inconsistent quality. I've seen many complain about their motors lately, while a few years ago their motors were excellent and a few years before that there were issues with their motors overheating."
airsoft,fgoy9mz,t1_fgoy81n,1580991641.0,"Eh, they've always had inconsistent quality. Their gear sets are like Windows, every other generation is meh."
airsoft,fgoy757,t1_fgovejd,1580991572.0,Be like non-existent?
airsoft,fgoy64r,t1_fgovydb,1580991544.0,"This isn't a new development, they've always had inconsistent quality really. They were no better a decade a go, but we still buy their parts because they're so cheap that it's worth the risk most of the time."
AskReddit,fgnivf6,t3_ezdg8b,1580945796.0,"Was about to comment on how me being Norwegian makes me part of 1% of the worlds population, then I realized we make up barely 0.1%..."
airsoft,fgnhg1n,t3_ez76by,1580944958.0,"That's ironically the price we pay for the low price of ACM parts. Even at $20 they have a good profit margin, so the actual production cost is very low. SHS isn't bankrupt yet so they're obviously cutting a lot of corners in the production."
aww,fglwbcs,t3_ez9a9w,1580912498.0,"People avoid adopting black cats because apparently they ""don't photograph well"". Yeah right."
airsoft,fgllxok,t1_fgkxmv2,1580903796.0,"Only reason they are slightly more ""foolproof"" is because they have an internal protection circuit, without that they would actually be more risky to use. I don't see how a 2600mAh battery can outlast a 2600mAh battery by a significant degree.

I actually am tempted to buy one and do some objective testing, but it's difficult to justfiy the cost just for testing and I don't really like supporting a company that I don't trust. It would be good to get some empirical data, as it seems almost nobody have done actual comparisons apart from spec sheets.

I wouldn't be comparing it with dinky little stick li-po's FYI, I'd compare with the li-po's I have that are somewhat close to them in price and capacity, so we're talking batteries with 2-3 times as high discharge rating on paper."
airsoft,fgkmo7l,t1_fgid4b6,1580869061.0,The truth of the matter is that the only advantages with li-ion cells versus li-po cells are higher capacity and their cylindricial shape can be easier to fit in cramped gun. If you want maximum power output li-po is the way to go since they have a significantly lower internal resistance.
airsoft,fgkmdd6,t1_fgitiqw,1580868882.0,"""I forgot the tank?! :O"" That one always cracks me up. :D"
AskReddit,fgiybds,t1_fgixko4,1580833449.0,This is true.
AskReddit,fgiwq0u,t1_fgiwk78,1580832559.0,I know the feeling...
AskReddit,fgiv72p,t1_fgiu97j,1580831624.0,That would be a useful skill indeed.
AskReddit,fgispjn,t1_fgirrpx,1580830067.0,"Its Ruko, I'm very happy with them, sharp and strong. Drilling steel feels like drilling aluminum and drilling aluminum feels like drilling wood almost."
AskReddit,fginhpo,t1_fgie3ln,1580826528.0,That's why I only buy high quality drill bits nowadays. Cheap ones are often not even sharpened properly and are also often relatively brittle. When I bought proper German made drill bits I was surprised at how relatively soft regular steel actually is because they actually cut the metal instead of just gnaw at it.
Showerthoughts,fgh52y5,t3_ey6tkh,1580776888.0,A forklift? I imagine something huge like a mobile crane or something.
airsoft,fggomkq,t1_fggl817,1580766208.0,That version has so few features it's not worth it for me and I'll also need the connection dongle. That'll get it close to 200
airsoft,fgfk4so,t1_fgfk1qz,1580740924.0,Because it costs three times as much and the differences aren't that substantial?
airsoft,fgfga2y,t1_fgfg5lq,1580737883.0,"Hm, maybe I should give them a try one time. The only ""ETU"" sold in my country is the ASCU and that thing does not have a good reputation. I have to order 90% of my airsoft parts from other countries anyway so it doesn't matter much which country I have to order from."
airsoft,fgfftay,t1_fgff3vy,1580737494.0,"I've seen mixed reviews about them, are they actually any good?"
airsoft,fgfegen,t1_fgemvjz,1580736304.0,"Preventing fire is definitely a benefit IMO, it can potentially save both your motor, battery and mosfet if the gearbox locks up. I either have mosfets with built-in fuse or a self-resetting thermal fuse in all of my AEG's. The entire point of a fuse is to be a point of failure, it will fail instead of a more expensive component in the system.

Would you build a car stereo without a fuse on the wires going from the positive battery terminal? That's a way to potentially fry your car."
airsoft,fgfe89h,t1_fgfdw6b,1580736098.0,"That's odd, they've always used brass in the Combat Machines in the past, I guess they've changed it recently."
airsoft,fgfe1tk,t1_fgfdd62,1580735928.0,"One of the more sensible replies in this thread, I use almost the exact same setup in one of my AK's, works extremely well. With pre-cocking semi-auto feels like a GBBR."
airsoft,fgfdixx,t3_ey6jld,1580735424.0,"They are indeed. I recommend investing a bit more money and get the Jefftron Leviathan instead, it's almost on par with the GATE Titan and BTC Spectre and cost less than $100."
airsoft,fgfcn6x,t1_fgfcld3,1580734570.0,"You'll notice by the weight and ""sound"" if it's alu or brass. It's possible that it's chrome plated brass, pretty sure that's what's in my G&G Top Tech M4."
airsoft,fgfbp5g,t1_fgf2hra,1580733613.0,You have a G&G with an alu stock barrel? Have they started to use alu barrels now? I have never encountered any G&G AEG with an alu barrel before.
funny,fge0wru,t3_exnk79,1580689263.0,"Yup, that seems about right."
AskReddit,fge0reg,t3_exxq2i,1580689206.0,"I'm Norwegian and also not into sports in general, so the Super Bowl is quite irrelevant to me."
AskReddit,fge01wu,t1_fg8s7ir,1580688864.0,"True, I find it silly that women that work as mechanics or truck drivers are belittled and/or ridiculed."
AskReddit,fgdzpo1,t1_fg92k9d,1580688707.0,"I'm a man and definitely like FPS games, but I also really enjoy other types of games, like KSP for example or simulator games like ETS 2."
AskReddit,fgdzegr,t1_fga1in1,1580688633.0,Cats are actually quite awesome.
AskReddit,fgdv2vg,t3_exomzy,1580687195.0,Trying to catch up on the long list of things I don't have enough time to do since we don't have more staff than absolutely necessary.
airsoft,fgdup9e,t3_exqlk0,1580687110.0,Have you actually tried measuring it? I have been able to fit an 11.1V 1400mAh li-po in the front guard of my ICS MP5A4 with some room to spare.
airsoft,fgdu5xz,t3_exrfgj,1580686925.0,"You replaced high quality parts with other parts of potentially equal quality, of course you're not seeing much difference. G&G guns have good quality stock barrels in my experience, so replacing the barrel was quite unnecessary, and if it already had the renowned green G&G hop-up rubber it definitely had good stock hop-up.

It's not always beneficial to replace stock parts as aftermarket parts aren't always higher quality than the stock parts. The stock barrel in my G&G Top Tech M4 easily rivals the bore quality of high end aftermarket barrels so why would I replace it? It would be a waste of money."
airsoft,fgdtbry,t3_exsauu,1580686621.0,"As others have stated, it won't necessarily be a cure, but physical excercise and socializing can definitely help. A day of airsofting certainly lifts my mood, it's a good variation from the everyday routine and it's refreshing to meet people outside of my regular social circle. 

Tinkering with my guns in the basement also puts me in a good mood, it's quite effective anti-stress for me."
airsoft,fgdsn2r,t3_exu91d,1580686445.0,"Spring/early summer and early fall for me, I prefer moderate temperature and dry weather for airsoft. 15-20\*C is ideal IMO."
airsoft,fgbjm6e,t1_fgbdb3y,1580662724.0,"I didn't say it would be a good DSG setup for $50, but it would be functional, for a while. You forgot ICS in your list of strong stock V2's btw, their split V2 gearbox has a very beefy front end.

I simply didn't agree with all of your points and wanted to clarify things a little."
airsoft,fgaedcb,t1_fg9jvkj,1580650271.0,"1. Many stock guns come with steel bushings.
2. Many stock guns have piston with partial or full steel teeth rack.
3. Many stock steel gears will handle a moderate DSG setup just fine if you shim them properly.
4. You'd be surprised how strong some stock motors are.
5. V3 gearbox? Even zink alloy V2 shells can handle strong spring if you radius it and it's of decent quality. The stock shell in my G&G Top Tech M4 has held up for a year with an SP150 spring in a 14:1 ratio DSG setup and there still are no signs of cracks."
airsoft,fgadmn9,t1_fg87jhu,1580650041.0,"If the base gun has a stock piston with enough metal teeth and a neo magnet motor you can get away with buying an SHS DSG, SHS M150 spring and a basic mosfet if it doesn't have one already. You'll obviously need a strong battery, but you'll need a battery for the gun anyway, so I don't count that expense.

Will it be a good DSG build? No. Will it have good ROF and work for a while? Yes.

How the heck did you spend $500 on a DSG build? I'd spend maybe $200 on an extreme DSG build not counting the base gun."
airsoft,fgaca5o,t3_exnfrz,1580649589.0,Exactly which parts are in your setup?

airsoft,fg7n5pg,t3_excx8b,1580596573.0,"50 RPS SSG is going to be nearly impossible, while 50 RPS DSG is doable if you're an experienced tech. In a 50 RPS SSG gearbox the sector gear is spinning at twice the RPM as in a 50 RPS DSG gearbox, at such high RPM the laws of physics become very annoying."
airsoft,fg5bquk,t3_ewxss5,1580523314.0,"You can still use it for an SSG setup, but why not just buy a new one? It doesn't make sense that you want to invest money in DSG related parts, but don't want to pay a few bucks for an extra tappet plate."
