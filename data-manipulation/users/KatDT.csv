TooAfraidToAsk,ffwfypj,t3_evftwn,1580299605.0,Not weird. Whenever my friends call my full name I think I'm in trouble
TooAfraidToAsk,ffs0bsl,t3_eukwcp,1580170041.0,"OP I totally understand. I've been spending most of my time at uni trying to make a name for myself in SOMETHING: be it music, art, gaming. I was terrified of being stuck in an office for the rest of my life. 

I'm about to finish university and go into the workforce (or at least try to get a full-time job). My biggest fear is that I won't have time to do what I want. I love my video games, I'm a Twitch streamer for a hobby, and I just don't want to be tired all the time because I have to commit 40+ hours to a job I don't like. I like the consistency though. I'm a bartender now and I get 2 shifts a week, 10 hours each. It barely pays rent but I enjoy it and have enough time for everything else. 

My plan is to have a 9-5 part time and then freelance on the side. That way I can still balance everything and I won't feel as ""stuck"""
socialanxiety,ffhh1sc,t1_ffh267d,1579934905.0,Omg. I keep thinking about my future wedding and then realising I don't have anyone to be my maid of honour
socialanxiety,fevqpti,t3_eq9hh2,1579400369.0,My friend texted me the other day and I legitimately thought she meant to text someone else because of this thought right here

""AH! THE GIRL WHO NEVER SPEAKS. HOW ARE YOU TODAY?""

OverwatchUniversity,fe0h699,t3_en7924,1578813378.0,I have to say as a Dva main I've just avoided the tank role altogether. I personally find the other tanks boring to play. Tried learning Wrecking ball but I'm not very good. The other tanks don't interest me.
Overwatch,f9hnkvq,t1_f9hlko2,1575318221.0,I'm sure there is. I'd just add a hot key to H where it would switch to a hero select overlay instead
