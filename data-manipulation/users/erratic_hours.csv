She’s like our moms side, rectangle, but with crazy long noodle limbs. We look so different there’s nothing really to compare, and I don’t mind looking curvy, I just want that effect of really looking slender too."
fatlogic,fdtm15e,t3_ems7pb,1578718711.0,"I have a second rant today: when I weighed myself yesterday I realized I’m only 5lbs heavier than my sister. The thing is she’s like 1/2 in taller than me at most, but she looks much thinner. I never realized I was a smaller person than her in body build until recently. Of course that means imma have to lose a bit more to get anywhere near her thin and elegant shape."
fatlogic,fdr0rzj,t3_ems7pb,1578677902.0,"I’ve had terrible constipation for a week, which I’m now wondering if is birth control (nexplanon) related bc this has been going on and off for months. So that sucks. I’m getting sick. Hate the social bits of work and I feel awkward and have been snacking on garbage everyday this week which makes me feel like crap, which I can’t do and is scaring me bc I looked up fecal impact on google. 

But hey. Broke a new record for lightest adult weight ever. I haven’t been 138lbs since early 8th grade and I’ve grown two inches since that time. I really like the way my body looks. Even with the bloating."
fatlogic,fdogwu5,t3_em9kad,1578604910.0,So did donald trump write that or..?
fatlogic,fdk7h7m,t1_fdjg81q,1578497827.0,"I've taken allll the steps back. If she want it done, she has to learn to do it for herself. I agree that there are definitely ways to figure out losing weight for yourself, but refusing to count calories unless someone does it for her and having 2-3 cheat days a week isn't going to cut it. Honestly I am just frustrated bc I'm worried. I get how hard it is too. Like I'm only down 25lbs and she prolly has at least 60lbs or so to even get to a healthy weight. I just so desperately don't want her to end up like her mom and it's like she doesn't even care, but last time we went through this I did all the counting and measuring for her and she lost 20lbs and then gave up. Oddly I feel like the failure tho."
fatlogic,fdh5jcl,t3_elcpmx,1578415836.0,"My mom has started trying to lose weight “my way” 4 or so times in the past 4-5 years. It’s terrible, but I just don’t believe in her ability to be disciplined enough to carry through. As soon as it’s too hard or any effort she stops, regaining and then some. Is it terrible I dont want to help her anymore? I answer her questions and would help if she asked, but I’m not interested in going out of my way to do this. Her mom was diagnosed w obesity related cancer. She knows her weight has already put her health at risk and has had medical ramifications for her. If that doesn’t light a fire idk what will."
fatlogic,fcsxjfe,t1_fcqf8ho,1577927622.0,"That, and I guess I cut it off but they commented or whatever the term is on post and listed foods that people say are bad but you should actually eat bc foo STIs food or whatever. Pop tarts was on that section. Didn’t realize it didn’t make it in. I don’t need to reach with this person. They legit say the weirdest stuff about food. I can’t believe someone I follow actually reblogged this."
fatlogic,fcsgqil,t1_fcsgeqt,1577916286.0,I started IF in 2019 too! I switch around between IF and OMAD depending on how hungry I am. Total game changer!
fatlogic,fcrrmne,t1_fcqpzbo,1577905684.0,Negative. She is dead serious. Someone I follow on tumblr reblogged a post of hers and after I saw it I fell down the rabbit hole.
loseit,fcnfrmr,t3_ei2wuj,1577810803.0,"That was only 6 months. Another 6 and you can be down however much, and another 6 even more. Time passes whether or not we do something with it. You might as well do your best. We’ll be here the entire time!"
DadReflexes,fclwh9u,t1_fcky4u6,1577758153.0,The only thing abt doorways is the door. In school (CA) we were always told to avoid any entryway with a door or else book it to a sturdy desk or table. Last earthquake worth mentioning in CA my bedroom door moved some and I was like oh yeah. Duh.
omad,fc5t56q,t3_ega12u,1577465294.0,I still count calories. It’s just a lot easier and quicker when it’s all in one go.
