Lexus,feminf8,t3_epupc3,1579257522.0,I do too. I think it's mainly the size of the car. The new IS models are much larger.
Lexus,feihp9u,t1_fd5j1f0,1579138783.0,That's pretty much new. Just beginning it's long life. Toyota motors are Rock solid.

Lexus,febi81s,t3_efzpvh,1578959101.0,I don't daily drive mine but you completely could. It's so fun comfy. If you really want it to be a daily get it without the perf package. The 21's make it a little bumpy.

Lexus,fctzjtc,t1_fctyuqf,1577967168.0,"Ah, that's another reason I can live with the LC is because I have a daily driver. The LC only comes out on nicer days :)"
Lexus,fcswwzi,t1_fcrlh1o,1577927181.0,Oh and the biggest thing was I wanted an NA v8 which are hard to come across these days.
Lexus,fcswu4t,t1_fcstt0b,1577927124.0,"If you get the LC with active rear steer, the car feels deceptively small and light when cornering. Slight understeer but manageable with a little throttle blip"
