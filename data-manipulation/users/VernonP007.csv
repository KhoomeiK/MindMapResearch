It’s about knowing what the target audience expects you to say and being confident whilst saying it. If you are confident and upbeat everyone is happy. If you are monotonous and nervy, everyone will feel it.

The trick is it doesn’t really matter what you say. People get hung up trying to memorise word for word what to say when they know a bit about the subject already. As long as you have a positive body language and you just try to be yourself then you’ll be fine."

Generally ever since The Matrix, action movies have relied on style over substance and fast cuts and an overuse of CGI. Then after seeing they great reviews for Mad Max Fury Road, I watched it in the cinema. 

I absolutely loved it! It was really batshit crazy and I really appreciated all of the choreography that made some of the chase scenes work. It’s one of those films where the action is the substance, and lots of plot and character moments happen amongst all of the mayhem.

I was also impressed with the action in Mission Impossible: Fallout which again relied on great choreography and stunt work."
