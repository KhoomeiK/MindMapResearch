Tonight I was catching up with a female friend and we were grabbing some takeaways you are welcome to join us.

I can also deliver pizza out to wherever if that is less intrusive. Pizza is like $5 so I can grab a few. (eg I remember when I was really hungry, sometimes having things given I found kind of hard)"

Years ago we got a police scanner and amount of crime and violence that is happening around us all, is amazing.

Its not that we have a lot of crime, but put a million people in a small city, you are going to have some people fleeing a scene."
PoliticalHumor,ffa0vn3,t3_esb2r9,1579725631.0,"History is not going to look kindly on their actions.

The way that the Republicans behaved right up to the end in the Watergate scandal was disgusting as well."
