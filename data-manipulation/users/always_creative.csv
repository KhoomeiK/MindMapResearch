I still think what OP was describing is a scam.  You can get S-rated (light commercial warranty) vinyl windows for under $300/opening and it takes at most 2 hours to replace one, so nobody should pay more than $500/opening for vinyl ever.   Wood windows can get under $1k/opening if they’re vinyl clad on the exterior, but probably not if they’re faced with aluminum."

HomeImprovement,ff6kbo9,t1_ff6iewd,1579629032.0,"Honestly, I think it’s a bigger phenomenon now.  Previous generations didn’t live in an age of $2 Burmese t-shirts.  Most goods, whether a door or a frying pan or a shirt, were expensive for the average person and were planned purchases.  Homes were often constructed over time as the owner had money, and they would have had a pretty good feel for their next investment, as well as the value of their own labor.

The expectation now is that everything should be super cheap because there’s always some crappy foreign import available for most things we buy.  A man in 1890 typically only had 3 changes of clothes because it was so expensive, today I probably have twice that in clothes I’ve forgotten in the back of my closet.

Building materials are, unfortunately, still complex and resource intensive and less available at low-grade price points.  Construction labor is scarce and very expensive.  Most people nowadays are not accustomed to dealing with supply chains and labor rates and so it’s a surprise to them, but that doesn’t mean that their expectations are justified."

Use broth concentrate instead of buying cans or boxes https://www.thekitchn.com/broth-concentrates-are-the-new-better-bouillon-cubes-tips-from-the-kitchn-214538

- roasted root veggies are cheap: potatoes, sweet potatoes, parsnips, carrots, beats, turnips.  Chop into half inch cubes, toss with olive oil and salt (use cheaper olive oil for cooking), maybe some paprika or cumin if you have it, and roast on a sheet pan at 400F for 40 minutes, turning every 10.  That’s it!

- Rice, pasta, noodles:  try not to get more than 30% of your calories from these sources, but this stuff is cheap and helps you stretch the rest of your food.  Serve beans or curries over them.  Pasta sauce in a jar is not evil no matter what the internet snobs say.  I lived off rigatoni in college.

- frozen veggies are your friend.  Use them in curries and stews, anything where they’re cooked in liquid, and you won’t notice a difference.

- beans and stuff from cans.  I make chana masala for real cheap: sautee a chopped onion, then add garlic, 2 cans chickpeas, 2 cans diced tomatoes, 1 tbsp cumin, 1 tbsp garam masala, salt to taste.  Simmer for 20 minutes, serve over rice.  The whole thing is $4 and you’ll get multiple meals out of it.

I own an architecture firm, and about half my technical staff is licensed (22/45), which exceeds the industry average.  While we don’t call unlicensed folks “architects” many of them do the same work or are even senior to licensed people.  From a regulatory standpoint, only the licensed staff are “professionals” and you have to be licensed to be an owner in the business."

DIY,fefhmvt,t1_fefgwqg,1579056510.0,"Gotcha, then I misunderstood.  Still, like I pointed out, it’s not just a pure investment decision.  Professionally I work in sustainable building and we do them as much for climate and health imperatives as for financial benefit.

I’m a “spread your money around” person as an investor.  I own rental property, do some new property development, buy index funds, dabble in individual stocks, and keep some cash on hand too, because my experience has been that the market is not as predictable as the averages would like it to be.  The returns are expected, but not guaranteed."
DIY,fefdx1e,t1_fef89f9,1579054247.0,"Solar water space heating does exist, but an electric heat pump and solar panels is cheaper and lower maintenance.  You’d couple that with an efficient envelope to keep the demand low and reduce swings in temp.  (I built myself an efficient house and when it was -5F outside it took the house 24 hours to go from 69 to 63 when I set the t stat back).

AFAIK, (at least in my area) the utility doesn’t net meter based on the rate of the energy at the time of use/generation.  They just zero out the total kWh at the end of the month before charging you for any remainder.  In my area though, you don’t get paid for excess generation so we undersize arrays to about 90% of expected usage."
DIY,fefd777,t1_fefa8hc,1579053789.0,"It’s fascinating but alas I am too lazy and bad at math to do it.  So in theory, reinvesting the savings let’s you double it?  There is almost no maintenance cost on a solar array btw, you just wash them annually and maybe replace an inverter or two.

I tend to view these things as less about direct payback.  In OP’s case, he clearly didn’t make a horrible financial choice, just one that’s potentially not as good as an index fund (although you could say that about almost any personal investment).  And he did something that makes him feel good about his home and lifestyle, which is worth it on its own.  And it does legitimately help address global energy issues, even as a small act.

It’s definitely a better financial decision than making yourself feel good by buying a sports car or a boat, and people make those decisions all the time."
DIY,fef2zv6,t1_feebhxf,1579046970.0,"OP’s array will save about $40k in energy bills over the lifespan of the system.  That’s after the payback period.  There’s not a lot of home improvements that have such a directly calculable return, assuming OP also stays in the house for that time period."
DIY,fef2tvp,t1_fedpnnk,1579046858.0,"Considering that the panels should be effective for ~30 years, it’s a large financial savings after the break even, so it’s a +/- $43,000 profit at the end of its lifespan at those rates."
DIY,fef2k22,t1_fee5v2l,1579046672.0,"Solar installations rarely include storage, it’s not a limitation on usage when you’re tied to the grid.  The array is net metered, meaning the power you generate goes on the grid and is credited against the energy you use.

The grid is your battery, and you aren’t necessarily using the power you make.  Electrical storage is crazy expensive and has a short lifespan, so the applications really only make sense as emergency reserve power or locations where the grid isn’t available."
DIY,fef2b7e,t1_fedxzd5,1579046505.0,"For this reason, solar usually makes sense to be sized just shy of your full production.  If you’re eliminating 95% of your power bill with solar, you’re getting credited at full retail so you’ve maximized payback on that investment, and you don’t have to worry what the crappy return is on the excess power.  Your power bill won’t be large, and you still have to pay the connection charges regardless.

Looking at direct payback, we’ve found the above approach to give us financial paybacks under 8 years in buildings we design (northeast US).  These are new buildings designed to be highly efficient, so the arrays aren’t that large or costly."
