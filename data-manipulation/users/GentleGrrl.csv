Folks internalize ideas from their culture and society - mostly as children but much as adults, too - and it can become a ""truth"" that is a basis for their worldview. Abandoning it seems catastrophic, plus all the usual cognitive biases - selection bias, confirmation bias, and the biggest one for this kind of thing, the sunk cost fallacy.

Compounding it, after all this time folks have come up with post-facto rationalizations that are eventually absorbed uncritically by children and passed to new generations, eventually making a web of half-truths and fallacious reasoning that is a labyrinth which few can escape without a great deal of support and lots of exposure to broader ideas and values."
