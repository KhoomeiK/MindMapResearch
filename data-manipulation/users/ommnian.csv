#### 5. If redaction or segregation of an education record of multiple  students can be reasonably accomplished without destroying the meaning  of the education record, can educational agencies and institutions  charge parents or eligible students for the costs of the redaction or  segregation?

No. FERPA provides parents and eligible students with the right to  inspect and review the student’s education records, and nothing in the  FERPA statute or regulations permits educational agencies and  institutions to charge parents or eligible students for fees or costs  associated with exercising that right.

If a school elects to provide a parent or eligible student with a  copy of the education records, then the FERPA regulations (34 CFR §  99.11(a)) generally permit (with the exception noted below) the school  to charge for the costs required to make the copy. FERPA regulations (34  CFR § 99.11(b)) also provide that the school may not charge a parent or  eligible student for the costs to search for or retrieve the education  records. We view the costs, if any, to the school of redacting, or  segregating, education records of multiple students as being like the  costs of search and retrieval that may not be charged to parents or  eligible students, rather than like the costs for copies that generally  may be charged to parents and eligible students. As noted above, if an  educational agency or institution can reasonably redact or segregate out  portions of an education record that is directly related to other  students, without destroying the meaning of the record, then the  educational agency or institution must do so and therefore cannot charge  parents or eligible students for the costs associated with exercising  their right to inspect and review such education records.

In contrast, parents and eligible students generally may be charged  for the costs of making copies of education records precisely because  FERPA generally does not require the school to provide them with such  copies. Thus, where the redaction or segregation of education records of  multiple students can be reasonably accomplished without destroying the  meaning of the education records, nothing in FERPA permits educational  agencies or institutions to charge parents or eligible students for the  costs of making the required redactions or segregation. Please note that  the FERPA regulations (34 CFR § 99.11(a)) similarly provide that if a  fee for copies effectively prevents a parent or an eligible student from  exercising the right to inspect and review his or her education  records, an educational agency or institution would be required to  provide copies without payment. Such cases would be limited to a parent  or an eligible student providing evidence of the inability to pay for  the copies due to financial hardship."
