This causes people do delay actions to combat climate change. I DO NOT believe we shouldn't take action right now, rather that many people are too nearsighted to see that we have to."
facepalm,fegrvfz,t1_fegqxd8,1579101089.0,That was part of my argument. The primary reason for buying electric vehicles are not (usually) to save the environment.

facepalm,fegizty,t1_feggweh,1579094241.0,"Of course, but there are changes that just costs money. And since money makes the world go around, people aren't willing to dump their money into something they can't earn something from. A good example of this is Tesla, and electric cars in general. People are willing to spend lots of money on an EV, but not because it saves the environment, that's just something people say to make themselves feel better about using said money. Of course there are some who actually cares, but to be totally honest, I believe everyone has some other primary intention."

facepalm,fegenf1,t3_ep0tk4,1579090128.0,I believe the problem is that global warming won't cause human extinction in the near future. This causes people to think less about it than something like a doomsday prophecy.
