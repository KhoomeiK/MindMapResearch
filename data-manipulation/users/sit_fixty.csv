All they can do is come down and make a report, Which takes them away from stopping other crimes.  The thief will keep on stealing because he knows there are no consequences.

You dont care about doing the right thing. If we just let everyone shoplift because it's an acceptable risk, then shoplifting would run rampant. Then shops would have to raise prices to make back the profit. Then self-obsessed dipshits like you would accuse the businesses of raising the prices out of greed. Im sure you'd feel differently if someone stole your stuff from your house. Like I said, you dont care about doing the right thing because you dont personally get something out of it."

2. Insulting an article someone wrote isn't insulting the person. The article didn't even say they liked or disliked the crossover.
3. I wasn't insulting an article, that was sarcasm. Me voicing my opinion on a Jojo/Hulk crossover doesnt reflect on anyone or anything but the crossover.
4. The crossover didn't exist, it was fanart. I simply stated that a (nonexistent) Jojo/Hulk crossover WOULD be stupid. 
You're trying really hard on this one. Saying anything negative about something is insulting the person who made it? Then you're hurling insults at me because you didn't agree with my comment.
