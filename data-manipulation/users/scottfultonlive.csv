Am I a moron if I offer this?"

Fantasy_Football,fc7eurg,t3_eglnqu,1577505326.0,"A number of ways of doing it but for the most part, same amount of rounds. Just the player you keep is your selection in that round.

For example if you picked Kenny Golladay in the 6th round and you want to keep him, he’s your 6th round pick next year. Some leagues also put them to 1 round after ADP to make it more fair. 

For some advice, keep the amount of players you can keep low (1 or 2) and the years you can keep them low (also probably one or two years max) because we switched to a 3 keeper league and you start to have much fewer premium talent available, and make it much harder for owners to bounce back from a bad year. 

Overall it’s a fun little strategic addition but if my league voted on removing keepers I probably would go for that"
