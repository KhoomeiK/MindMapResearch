> Nobody refers to a JRPG as 'a game where the story's characters are dictated to you/you don't make your character'

I think you're confusing me with OP, I didn't say that is the criteria for a game to be or not be JRPG. My point was just that JRPG is used to describe a certain style of games so if someone outside japan makes a similar game I'll gladly call it a JRPG.

Either way, all these different subgenres are kinda vague either way with tons of edge cases so I don't treat the labels as anything more than ""suggestions""."
Games,fgow3sn,t1_fgovvym,1580989244.0,I would argue that if a western dev makes a game using a similar formula it should be called JRPG nevertheless. If it's used to describe a type of game it shouldn't matter what country the studio is located in.
