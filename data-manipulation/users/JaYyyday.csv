I know you’re  tired, tired of fighting your own thoughts, tired of pretending to be okay. Tired of being trapped in your head. You are not alone. You are loved, and if you choose to fight another day (which I really really hope you do!!) you will get the help you need, and then you’ll get the peace you deserve. Giving up is easy, but going against your odds and coming out on top is beautiful. I hope you get your peace darling. You have people rooting for you xx"
