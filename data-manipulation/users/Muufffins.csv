If companies will move to places with less red tape, that means they're not interested in creating jobs. They want to maximize profit. They'll go somewhere to minimize the amount out people they need to employ."
alberta,fel2i4l,t1_fek7r8h,1579212644.0,Wouldn't the red tape increase jobs? It means more inspections and compliance to make sure rules are being followed. This means more manpower needed to complete a certain task...

The parking situation is better at Louise, but the lifts from the base area tend to be crowded. Up high, backside and larch should be mellow.

Traffic will be busy coming back, but not Colorado levels. Just lots of aggressive drivers in big trucks with high beams on. It's a weekend thing."

Also, be aware that the 17th is a holiday, and the few days before that weekend schools are closed. This makes for a busy time.

If you want quiet, and have the budget, the post hotel in Louise is nicer than the Fairmont(which has small rooms) If you want to party, stay in Banff.

You need a shovel, beacon, and partner for the dive. MEC and the U of C will rent in Calgary. Not sure about Banff.

Norquay really isn't worth it, unless they have a dump, or you want to experience the North American chair.

Be prepared for cold. Things shut down for a while last February because of the cold.

If you're buying lunch, the soup/salad buffet at Louise is probably the best deal around."
