And good luck with that, My heart goes out to Mr. Dooling for the tragic loss of his dog Buddy."

Damnthatsinteresting,ff8c3x5,t1_ff8bfoy,1579672500.0,"bench scientist has an undergrad in bio or in my sister’s case animal science, and carries out the processes of a particular lab project. They mix the “magic potions” and record the results. I guess you could also say they are lab techs. Object Permanence is a concept describing a major benchmark in the human growth and development of infants and children. When babies start to play peek-a-boo this is a sign of them beginning to understand and experiment with “Object Permanence.” Google it for a deeper explanation. It’s interesting."
explainlikeimfive,ff8apa9,t1_ff89fa3,1579671110.0,distilled water isn’t nutrient rich by a long shot but it would still serve its purpose of hydration. From that perspective I would not call it food. even if one had access to only mineral water it would not keep a body alive.

Damnthatsinteresting,ff83c6h,t1_ff828s8,1579664884.0,"This is very insightful comment. my sister has 14 dogs no children a weird marriage and she tells me her dogs are like her children. Our dad flat out says she is mistaken, but then, he’s like that. I never say anything bc it’s not really important or helpful at this stage. My husband and i have three adult children. In my retirement I have two dogs. They are CLEARLY different relationships but I could never find a scientific (she is/ was a bench scientist) explanation to point out the difference. And i for sure know she has never considered object permanence as a concept. That’s not to say that dogs don’t have long memories and emotional connections."

dogs,ff566ki,t3_ernvdq,1579581355.0,i have a saluki female who pees submissively from puppyhood. it has improved with me limiting my overexcited hellos. sometimes if it has been all day or evening i will bring her outside to greet. the peeing spots on the carpet however could be a territorial thing.
Dogtraining,ff4dzqm,t3_erl566,1579561360.0,"i have a female saluki with same sorts of issues. increasing reactivity to other dogs that she sees on walks, outside on the road as we drive by. it’s a management issue i think. For example she has been increasingly bad on walks lately so i switched to the off leash park today. she still barks but there is no lunging and she actually tries to play.  but it’s hard bc i don’t see her changing. she is even reactive to my other very gentle saluki boy at feeding time. but i just feed them in separate areas. i’ll be watching your post for some positive stories."
