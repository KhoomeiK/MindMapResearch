Sure it takes time to do, but not to line people up? I would understand if other companies  had this issue... but not fucking google."

wholesomememes,ffedg9h,t1_ffe66e6,1579843979.0,"Every time I see a mess or a peice trash lying around, I imagine the worse possible outcome of me ignoring that (no matter how unlikely). Usually someone slipping and falling and hurting themselves, or even just stepping on it. This thought is all the motivation I need to stop whatever I'm doing, take 5 seconds, and clean it up."
brakebills,ffecwsr,t3_et0j65,1579843467.0,"I think it could be some sort of Psychic reverberations from the surges. That fact that it's a signal and not thoughts tells me its not human. Now what those mean, I'm not sure. It could be that the surges could lead to some truly devastating magic on a massive scale, aka the apocalyptic event mentioned in ep 1."

Games,fezn734,t1_feywcrk,1579459246.0,"I thought the ending of Deus Ex: Human Revolution was amazingly gray. Throughout the whole game, I thought I knew what my stance on augmentation was. But once you see how those triumphs can lead to devastating effects, it really makes you question if we are ready for such a power. The only thing I didn't like was not being able to see how your choice pans out. But, I guess thats more realistic. Adam is key in deciding which path it will take, but not be there to see where it leads."
