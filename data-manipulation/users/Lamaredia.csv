Thank you for the correction!"
todayilearned,fdwgyqd,t1_fdwec4s,1578758572.0,"Yep, the capsule is designed to first break down in the colon.

C. Dif infection is primarily caused by the good gut bacteria becoming weakened and/or eradicated due to broad-spectrum antibiotics used for another ailment. The faeces pills brings new colonies of the other gut bacteria to fight C. Dif.

A big reason for the change is that a colonoscopy usually requires anaesthesia which can be an issue for the body, and the pills costs on average 500 USD less per procedure than the colonoscopy does.

Of course, colonoscopy still occurs and there are a few other methods that are also used, but the pills are becoming more and more common."
