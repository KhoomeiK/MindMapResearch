Older cars get funny about trace elements not being present in modern oil that were there in older oils, so sometimes they run hella worse or don't have the same longevity because the modern oil formulation is missing magnesium (or something, you get the drift). It's not really the ""synthetic vs dino"" part that hurts the most there, it's the specific formulation. I use a ZDDP additive in my Buick because the cam needs a certain thing in the oil to be properly lubricated that modern grade oils don't include anymore.
