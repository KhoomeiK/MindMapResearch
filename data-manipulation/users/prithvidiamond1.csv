But I will say that most of those questions are quite basic and that even though from a practical stand point, you wouldn't need to know what is a string or too much about the Fibonacci sequence, but those are at least what I feel are basic terms in COMPUTER SCIENCE. I feel that you aren't someone who took up coding through computer science (I may be wrong however...), in which case it is understandable. Just saying that you should start learning about such terms as people who have come from a computer science background would easily crack such an interview and take your place. Just take up any university/high-school computer science book that has directly relation to coding/programming especially those that center around a particular language, in this case Python and in almost all such books, the introductory chapter will have what is a string, list, class etc. All the basics will be there and you won't have to feel so awkward ever again in an interview for not knowing something that some people consider basic!"

learnpython,fg6rqtb,t3_ex6zwq,1580575368.0,"Just some small advice that I can give (I have only been coding for about 2 years now and only know python so I am just noob as you, guess that is where we all start from right...) :

Try using the `secrets` module rather than `random` as the `secrets` module has a better random generator than `random`. For almost all cases other than something that must be confidential, `random` module will serve anybody just fine! But `random` must not be used for generation of anything that is confidential; It is so inferior that this is present in the `random` module official [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html):

>**Warning**  
>  
>The pseudo-random generators of this module should not be used for security purposes. For security or cryptographic uses, see the [secrets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#module-secrets) module.

And `secrets` is quite similar to `random`, it has similar functions to that in `random`.

By the way, happy coding!"
