AskReddit,ffjf8bf,t3_ett7fr,1579996994.0,"Taking strong antibiotics while at my destination wedding for an ear infection. I was put on aggressive antibiotics to make sure my ear was healed for the flight home. This was around the same time my brother-in-law was dying of cancer so we were frequently visiting him in the hospital back home. Thanks to the antibiotics killing my microbiome, I contracted C diff. from the hospital. I wasn't informed of the seriousness of it, so I was never quarantined or told of the close to 10% mortality rate. I don't know how close I came to dying, but it took over two years to heal my gut. The first six months included several visits to the hospital to get rehydrated, a miscarriage, anemia and tooth loss as I couldn't digest nutrients well. I used to not eat until I got home at night because I was terrified of the bleeding and pain and such while working. I became lactose, gluten, and basically most foods intolerant. I was eventually able to work up from brown rice to adding in some boiled & peeled nuts, and a few cooked vegetables. With lots of care and probiotics, I saw slow and steady progress and can now eat a normal diet.  In the end it all worked out....my health is fine now and I have two beautiful children. But man those two years were a challenge."
explainlikeimfive,ffgsqgl,t1_fff5sn4,1579914097.0,"I just went to a lecture done by a disease pathologist who researchers the microbiome's effect on one's immune system and autoimmune diseases .... everything you said is very much in line with the speech she gave. One interesting thing she mentioned is that probiotics are at their most effective after gut trauma when your gut needs colonization. When it is fully colonized (with good or bad bacteria), it's very hard for the probiotics you consume to make room for themselves in there. The importance of prebiotics in maintaining a healthy gut cannot be overstated. 
 From my personal experience of a case of C. Diff I had several years ago (after being on strong antibiotics for an ear infection while traveling after having visiting a hospital with a C dif. outbreak), it took me years to re-colonize my gut. Kimchi, sauerkraut, probiotic supliments, and yogurt played large parts in my diet, which was a Low FODMAP diet. After two years, I was finally able to tolerate most foods again. Gut issues are no joke."
Parenting,fe46wxz,t3_enlvnp,1578856340.0,"You sound like you are doing everything that your child needs. If you are meeting his basic needs and surrounding him by love, you are off to a great start. Be gentle on yourself. Exhaustion can really screw with your perception of yourself as a parent. The first year goes by in a fog and sometimes it's just about survival. Keep going. You may never feel like you know what you're doing, but you'll eventually get to a point where you feel more comfortable with that sense of winging it. We're all figuring it out as we go. It can be scary to think that there is no big secret that you're missing out on....that all of us are just doing the best that we can. As long as you are doing the best you can, you're on the right path."
lifeprotip,fe20ztg,t1_fe0bf76,1578833352.0,That is a much better way of making this tip useful for everyone. Thanks!  Now to get organized enough to not spend my mornings searching for the things I need to leave....
lifeprotip,fe20p7k,t1_fe1r27r,1578833244.0,"Ah, good to know. I am in Canada so it's currently winter boot time. Wearing your boots inside would be a great way to ruin all your floors from slush and road salt being tracked in so everyone leaves them at the door. And you wouldn't want to step outside without them."
GetMotivated,fcswfor,t3_ehdy2u,1577926838.0,"I began my new year's resolution to be less critical. Less self-critical, less situationally critical, and less critical of others. One day in and I'm already invigorated by how refusing to indluge little negative thoughts takes away their power and helps me stay in a contented state."
GetMotivated,fcsw4nm,t1_fcj3rv8,1577926614.0,"I cannot upvote this enough. Good on you! That realization took me a long time to get to in therapy. Once I became my own hero, it seriously snowballed. Going from ""based on how others treat me I must be ....""  to ""this is how I  am going to demand you treat me""  was a game changer. So many healthier relationships, so many more opportunities, so many less anxiety attacks. I realized that I had the power to get myself out of bad situations/relationships and it was unfair of me to expect others to leap to my rescue if I wasn't willing to myself. I'm sure your path is different than mine but what you just brought up was a fundamental shift in the trajectory of my life, one that has ultimately brought me to a place of love and growth that is now my reality. I wish you so much strength to keep going. Sending good vibes your way. You've got this!"

tifu,fcirf3h,t1_fchmcfo,1577668034.0,"Years ago there was a friendly custodian where I worked who had a very thick accent. I very rarely understood him so I would just smile, nod, and respond with ""yeah"" a lot. One evening I came across him in the hall as  I was leaving work and we started to chat. I happened to have a change of clothes in my large purse for meetings that evening that I never ended up having time to change for. Shortly after I grab my keys from my purse, he says something to me. I miss it so I do my typical head nod, smile and say ""yeah."" Then he got awkward and there was a long silence between us. Turns out my panties (lace thong no less) had fallen onto the ground between us when I grabbed my keys from my purse. He had told me I dropped something, which was clearly a lace thong, and I had responded by smiling, nodding, saying ""yeah"" and leaving them there as I stared back at him. Most embarassing moment ever."

SuicideWatch,fcewuhf,t3_eh4ep7,1577624479.0,That sounds really hard. I'm sorry that voicing your struggle has gotten you to lower points with the people you know. I'm glad you're opening up here.
SuicideWatch,fcewe61,t3_eh50my,1577624339.0,"You can have it tough without there being external factors to make it so. Your struggle is real and need not be compared to others. You're hurting, and your hurt is valid. Not need to belittle your experience because of other's situational obstacles. When I struggled the most in the past, my life seemed pretty good on paper but I still felt like I was drowning. I'm sorry you haven't seen the results you were hoping for with all your workout efforts, but man it's impressive that you can be so dedicated."

I hope you're able to get through this. Maybe those friends will be receptive to you reaching out if ever you felt up to it. And if you don't, that's ok too."
SuicideWatch,fcc2ln0,t3_eh1du6,1577593706.0,"I'm guessing he is serious. He might feel lost without you and is thinking hurting himself is the only answer. It's clear he cares about you. And you care about him. Please wait. Wait and see if tomorrow is a little bit less horrible. You have made it this far, please give life one more day. And then if you're able to, one more day after that. Small steps. Death can wait. I don't know you but I believe in you. I'm sending loving and protective thoughts your way. Please hang on. Please.

Edit: I just wanted to add that I'm really sorry you are suffering. I'm a complete stranger possibly living continents away, but I genuinely wish you well."
Parenting,fcbyibh,t3_egsxcc,1577592385.0,"It's natural to struggle. Especially if this is your first child, you're getting thrown from a completely self-centered way of living to other-centered. It's hard when they are young....and if you're breastfeeding or single parenting the lack of sleep makes it very challenging. It gets easier. Self care is important, including a few moments of freedom whenever you can get them. When my first son was born by day 5 I was going stir crazy and ready to break after feeling like a milk maid and servant 24/7. I remember handing him over to my husband and telling him I needed 15 minutes to run to the coffee shop. My husband offered to go instead or make me tea and I refused....I just needed that little car ride and wait in line to be alone and only responsible for myself and my own needs. It got easier with time, but I definitely still enjoy the times where I get to take a break and only take care of myself."
AskReddit,fcbwlb0,t1_fcbud3l,1577591773.0,"Oh man those other comments would hurt so much. They voice a worry that already inhabits the loss instead of being reassuring or comforting. My main comfort after having a miscarriage was giving birth to my first son a year and a half later....knowing that it had to have happened that way for me to end up with the son I have. He wouldn't exist otherwise. I love him so much I wouldn't change anything, and  that realization finally extinguished the pain. But even that is of no comfort to anyone going through the trauma of a miscarriage."

AskReddit,fcbs8tu,t1_fcbjgge,1577590394.0,That is very considerate of you
AskReddit,fcbs47s,t3_egwusn,1577590353.0,"When my brother-in-law died, I went over to my sister's house and scrubbed it top to bottom. I helped orchestrate a meal plan with her friends so that meals would be dropped off each night. I also babysat my very young niece and nephew.  And while she greatly appreciated it all, I think what she appreciated the most was the random drop ins to watch movies, binge on popcorn and pretend for a very precious few hours that the world hadn't just turned upside down. She eventually asked friends to stop bringing food because she found that the act of cooking was a welcome distraction from her loss. So I guess it depends on the person and timing....sometimes they need assistance with basic tasks and other times they need distractions and a break from all the heaviness. 

If you're just looking for a comforting phrase, my go-tos include ""I'm so sorry you're having to go through this"" and "" I'm sending love your way"".  Also, asking ""what can I do help you?"" is a lot more promising and immediate than ""let me know what I can do to help""."

Parenting,fc7ftcz,t3_egd8aa,1577506139.0,"Some years will just be about survival. And that's ok. You've survived parenting this long and you'll keep going and it will get easier. Some age groups are tougher than others. Some parents relish the cutesie younger years where their kids are adorable handfuls. Others reach their stride once their children have matured a bit and become fun people to hang out with without having to police them. Hang in there. You'll find your stride. Also....do what you need to do to maintain sanity. Sometimes tv has to be a third parent and everyone is better off for it. Sometimes you have to have a ""lawless"" hour where kids are allowed to run amuck simply so that you get a break from policing. 

I can relate to the excited look toward the clock for bed time, as I'm sure every parent can. One thing I found helpful when I was in the thick of toddler tantrums was my late afternoon me-time. It was a simple 5-10 minute stop in a parking lot near a coffee shop on my way home from work (or tea from a thermos to save money and parking anywhere that had a somewhat empty parking lot). I would get coffee in the drive through and then sit  alone in my car in either silence or listening to relaxing music, depending on my sensory needs at the time. Those breaks helped refill my energy when I felt depleted."
lifehacks,fc6o2lx,t1_fc6n78y,1577485192.0,Good to know. Thanks! I just assumed that advice was to ensure you don't run out of gas far from a gas station so I never worried since I tend to only use the car for quick trips close to home. After seeing your comment I read about condensation in the gas tank....particularly bad during cold weather....and here I am in Canada in winter. Thanks for the tip!
