So many XS leggings are too big on me. But can I complain? No. Because then I hear the sarcastic comments like, “oh, what a *terrible* problem it is to be too thin!” 

Ya know what yes it’s pretty annoying. I used to be in XXL leggings too and those weren’t hard to find. So. Stuff it."
fatlogic,fek34cx,t1_fej2flz,1579191597.0,"Yeah, I don’t get how it can be equal parts traumatizing and “fuck you I’m fat & proud.” Those seem to be mutually exclusive."
fatlogic,fehmiht,t1_feh85wx,1579119556.0,"I know it’s a simple typo but “high calorie smacks” has me giggling. I’m picturing some full-fat, high fructose corn syrup covered hands coming at my face."
fatlogic,feh4b6s,t3_ep26oc,1579108858.0,"Nah. I used to be fat. Over 100lbs later, I’m not fat. I don’t *have* thin. I am thin."
fatlogic,fbe53ib,t1_fbd3cm7,1576778381.0,"Yeah. I’m 5’1” and super active & weigh 130. I always want to be under that but getting into the 120s I feel like crap and I’m sluggish and have no energy. I FEEL like I need to weigh less for my height but I’m a size 0 or 2, I don’t really have much to lose? I don’t know. But it’s super easy to maintain 130, I don’t even need to think about it."
