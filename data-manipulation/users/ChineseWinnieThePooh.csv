I would sign an executive order for the cloning of humans, and order tons of clones of all the most altruistic people like Mister Rogers, and Jimmy Carter in hopes they would encourage others to be the same.  Then, I would dismantle and order public corporal punishment of those at the top of the most corrupt corporations like Nestle, Comcast, Monsanto, Microsoft, etc.  Then increase our education budget to be equal to the military budget.  Make 4 year college mandatory, and doctorates, and masters optional, but fully subsidized with good grades, and offer additional financial incentives to those who maintain 3.5 or higher GPA.  The funds for this wouldn't be an issue, as I would shift the money away from tax loopholes for the rich, and overspending of needless bureaucratic agencies.

 - Get one-tapped by usp through mid rush in pistol round.  Luck.
 - Next round, get insta-peeked at long-doors and onetapped again.  Luck again, of course.
 - Next round, when rushing b-site, all 5 CT decide to rush through tuns to flank.  Luck.
 - Next round, when going A-long, all 5 CT decide to rush to upper mid, and rush out A-doors without peeking a single corner, and insta-headshot someone in pit with AK when peeking out long doors.  Luck again of course.

Game continues like this without being able to hold/peek/rush anywhere and ends 12-16.  Luck again, of course.  Couldn't be cheating."

AskReddit,ff4mse2,t3_erhu3x,1579567404.0,"Yes, and I feel lucky in the infrequent event that I remember it, and I want to tell people about it.  Then halfway through my morning shower, I realize that it would be about as interesting as telling a grandpa-simpson story... then when I step out of the shower, I forget it altogether, but retain a small imprint of the emotion, like you were looking for something, but suddenly forget why or what it was altogether.

Occasionally, I will remember pieces when real-life events match up closely to it.  For example, a frequent one is missing schedules/appointments due to forgetting them, often the day before my obligation.  I will imagine I overslept, or I'm at work at 8:30 when I had to take off to be somewhere at 8.  I'll be doing something similar to the dream after I wake up, such as rushing to get in the car, or grab some food, or hitting the brake pedal (in the dream my brakes failed), and remember that specific part and be slightly amused by it.  Then I check my master cylinder even though I know it's good."
