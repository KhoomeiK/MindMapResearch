Neverwinter,ffhqd3x,t3_esn7ki,1579948308.0,"The Turmish Lion mount gives Equip Power: When you or a party member are struck by a foe, there is a chance you will gain a stack of Ferocity, granting you 2% additional damage as physical damage for 10 seconds. Thi effect may stack up to 3 times.

- 10k more power at 100k power = 5% damage increase.
- 10k more power at 150k power = 4% damage increase.
- 10k more power at 200k power = 3.33% damage increase.

(half for 5k power)

On the other hand, a 6% damage buff is less effective as you get more damage buffs :

- at 0% damage buffs = 6% damage increase.
- at 30% damage buffs = 4.6% damage increase.
- at 60% damage buffs = 3.75% damage increase.

(3 times less for 2%)

Ferocity sounds pretty good, but its utility depends on how often you get hit."

Sigh, unzips Anne frankly, I did nazi that coming. I literally came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, 11/10 with rice, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F ""about tree fiddy"" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as ""NOPE NOPE NOPE""? Nice try, you monster. You are now banned from [/r/pyongyang](https://www.reddit.com/r/pyongyang) What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as ""YOU HAD ONE JOB"". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. Jet fuel can't melt dank memes, that stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Fuck Jenny. Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism.

This is what most people in my community are worried about. Once the Chinese find a stable supply somewhere else they'll probably pay more just so they cant be pushed around. 

They'll probably still buy pork products because there is no other country that has our quality and quantity but I'm willing to bet our corn and soy trade with china has been irreversible destroyed for at least the next decade."

Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, 11/10 with rice, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F ""about tree fiddy"" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as ""NOPE NOPE NOPE""? Nice try, you monster. You are now banned from [/r/pyongyang](https://www.reddit.com/r/pyongyang) What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as ""YOU HAD ONE JOB"". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. Jet fuel can't melt dank memes, that stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Fuck Jenny. Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. [/r/dadjokes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes). Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle.  Yes officer, this comment right here and how do I delete someone else's post.

Edit: This blew up. RIP my inbox.

Edit2: thanks for the gold kind stranger"
educationalgifs,fe5380x,t1_fe2me1p,1578865254.0,You should give Dragons Egg a read. It's a hard science fiction book about if life was to evolve on the surface of a neutron star. They even made a episode on Star Trek Voyager by the same name based on the book. It's a bit dated now but still a good read or listen if you have audible.
educationalgifs,fe1w3n7,t1_fe1hvz9,1578831606.0,Crazy too because she's done it at age 20 instead of 50. She's going to look absolutely horrible when she's older.
Neverwinter,fdtxdki,t1_fdrbkwa,1578723759.0,Sounds groovy my dude. Vorpal it is.
Neverwinter,fdr6x50,t1_fdqxcnf,1578680276.0,Thx!
Neverwinter,fdr6vi0,t1_fdr01du,1578680249.0,"So stay with vorpal for now then you're saying.

Also, here's a [picture](https://i.imgur.com/xvqOyZ0.jpg) of my cockring. It's too small and doesn't fit on all the way, but its cute!"
Neverwinter,fdqvlxi,t1_fdqul1u,1578675552.0,I'm pretty much maxed on stats right now and have about 170k power. You're saying bile would be the better option then.
Neverwinter,fdqu764,t1_fdqryeg,1578674961.0,I think Vileporn sounds better tbh.
MagicLegends,fdnulvs,t1_fdnr37x,1578593159.0,This is Diablo or Path of Exiles. I don't understand why the dev's said it would be a mmo when with the first game footage out everyone clearly can tell its not.
MagicLegends,fdnm0ng,t1_fdnjqk6,1578588599.0,It looks like a mobile game. And I guarantee it will have mtx like one being as you need cards to build your character. Maybe this is good news for me since I might have spent alot if it would have been a true mmo. I've already spent enough in neverwinter the way it is.
MagicLegends,fdnec71,t1_fdl8vx7,1578583991.0,"Yeah they are. They said so, so it is."
Conservative,fdk4cdh,t1_fda5kk8,1578495741.0,"Most farmers are getting welfare from the government so their not hurting to bad yet. Crop prices are still low. The problem most I've my friends fear is even when our markets open back to the Chinese they'll still buy from Ukraine and South America because they dont want the U.S. to have leverage over them. This is what most people in my community are worried about. Once the Chinese find a stable supply somewhere else they'll probably pay more just so they cant be pushed around. 

They'll probably still buy pork products because there is no other country that has our quality and quantity but I'm willing to bet our corn and soy trade with china has been irreversible destroyed for at least the next decade."
Neverwinter,fdinijk,t1_fdhe9gr,1578446861.0,I'd also add for defensive slots Harpers bard or red dragon ion stone which gives incoming healing and HP. Crystal golem gives HP and power and goes in your offensive or utility slot. Any of these or the ones the other commenter said are good. Just pick the ones that fit your build
Neverwinter,fdgso84,t1_fdgro1o,1578407313.0,I agree on the HP companions. I've invested and bought all the ones that give the most from the auction house and have them all leveled up to epic. Was just looking for some alternatives for when I solo or run lower group content. I wish rust monster perk would proc on at-wills over encounters so I could slot that but its seems useless now.
Neverwinter,fdetjyb,t1_fdct29a,1578346304.0,"I've noticed with most posts and replies they all get downvoted. This game really drove someone crazy that now they come to this subreddit, lurk and downvote everything and everyone."
Conservative,fd8ifgb,t1_fcqeddf,1578218737.0,"Why when we had a balanced budget did Trump and the Senate cut taxes and put us in a deficit. No one in my tax bracket saw any help from it. Plus all of my friends got less back after the year in their tax returns. We had a balanced budget, now we're running a deficit because why? Whoever gained from it wasn't the blue collar man. Also farmers are hurting horribly. Now China is getting there food from Ukraine and south America, there likelyhood coming back to America isnt good. The want stable food supplies. They're willing to pay more for that. We cant hold our agricultural above them anymore."
Conservative,fcqbm6k,t1_fcq93ma,1577882796.0,"Why does it have to be ""leftist"" and everyone else. The way your putting is that everyone is you and outside that is leftist. I dont get it. I live in one of the most rural parts of the country. My parents both served in the military, that's where they met in the 70s. My uncle was in Vietnam, my cousin was in Iraq and Afghanistan along with my Dad. I grew up shooting guns and went to catholic school till eight grade.  I picked rock out of fields, detasled corn, milked cows, shoveled shit. I'm one of the most blue collar Americans in the country. But you label me as a leftists because I dont like the memes clouded this sub. A person can be conservative and liberal at the same time. All I'm saying is this sub has lost its way"
Conservative,fcq8sw2,t1_fcq5key,1577881148.0,"So there's no middle ground at all. It's just leftist and alt right and that's it. No communication in between. I hate the reddit hive mind but this sub is no different than politics anymore. Back in its heyday it was much more level headed, now it's just a clone of the Donald"
pcmasterrace,fceb7td,t1_fce9y2y,1577618835.0,I'm alright with lead and thousands of rounds of spent casings around me. I don't like going there with someone slowly demolishing a old microwave one shot at a time. I'm glad you pick up after yourself but most people I see who bring appliances to destroy leave their shit there.
pcmasterrace,fce8wo9,t1_fce7dsx,1577618062.0,When I go shooting I just go to a old rock quarry about three miles outside of town and shoot at old oil barrels someone put there thirty years ago. I don't bring old appliances to fuck up and make a mess.
pcmasterrace,fce6l72,t1_fce2qmh,1577617418.0,I disagree
pcmasterrace,fce06gg,t1_fcdy1lm,1577615546.0,"All the games I wanted to play had a long code written out by hand by my dad on a sheet of paper I would enter. Once confirmed, it would copy the floppy on the harddrive for about 10 minutes and after that you could play. Probably about the same thing."
pcmasterrace,fcdxbsl,t3_eh47g2,1577614751.0,"All the F1, F2, F3, F4 ect buttons are the ones all the right side of the keyboard."
pcmasterrace,fcdw0tu,t1_fcduytz,1577614361.0,[here's what looked like compact ](https://i.imgur.com/TVJRQGg.jpg)
pcmasterrace,fcdvg6d,t1_fcduytz,1577614259.0,The keyboard attached to the front part. You could carry it around like briefcase. I'd say it weighed about 10 or 12 pounds.
pcmasterrace,fcdugnz,t1_fcdsye6,1577613930.0,"We also had one of those perforated printers that were loud as fuck on it too. Also had a scandalous karaoke game on there that I dont think I should have found about, but I did."
pcmasterrace,fcdsvae,t1_fcdsfya,1577613385.0,Commodore was the best you could get late 70's early 80's
pcmasterrace,fcdsn3g,t1_fcdrt0f,1577613291.0,It was a beautiful thing. You could play Atari games off floppy discs with a shitty joystick
pcmasterrace,fcdsgnq,t1_fcdrqyj,1577613213.0,You had to put floppy discs in and type the perfect commands in to get anything to load. I had to type a long script to just play dig dug
CFB,fcahw23,t1_fca6ji9,1577569525.0,I think the mindset of a 17 or 18 year old is you have to be on the very best team you can get on so you can make it to the NFL.
CFB,fc86kwd,t1_fc7ifqf,1577528009.0,Humiliating isn't the same as humbled.
BattlefieldV,fbvncne,t1_fbvm2nw,1577133298.0,I couldn't see where the BAR was to purchase in the support guns in game.
