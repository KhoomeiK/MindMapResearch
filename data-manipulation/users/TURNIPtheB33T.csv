VictoriaBC,ffagiy1,t1_ff8amrk,1579735220.0,"That is crazy. I'm in Burnaby ATM for 2-3 months and just a few nights ago, across from BCIT a guy got rolled up on at the gas station and shot 4-5 times. Pretty bizarre too cause it was around 6:30 and Wellington Ave is a gong show with traffic.

I must of had my headphones in and been doing something because I would of been sitting at my desk around that time and have a clear look at the gas station. 

Anyway apparently it's the 3rd one in a 2 block radius in 3 weeks. I suspect gang related because the guy(I think just one?) just drove up and followed him into the gas station, jumped out and shot him and took off. Clearly targeted you would think.

Edit

just looked again for details and they are saying it was targeted. Lower mainland gangs apparently. They found there car torched in Langley later that evening. Crazy . I wanna come back to vic lol"

MadeMeSmile,ff9udqr,t3_esa46q,1579721554.0,"I dunno why but this just reminded me of the video I watched with Joe Budden talking about XXXtentacion.

He talked about how it's hard to watch when young black males will begin to get some success, similiar to X, and when they are finally making money they continue to stay in the environment in which they grew up. He mentioned that eventually, if you live long enough, that you mature and realise that you have the opportunity to leave and you should get the hell out of there.

I wasn't an X fan, but I listened to a lot of the backstory regarding his life and it's honestly really sad. I read some of his lyrics and you could tell he was finally getting to the point where he new he wanted out and he had bigger plans for his life. He was waking up to the fact that his upbringing was not normal and had an opportunity to change and live a better life. He then gets killed. 

Anyway maybe it was the title about second chances that made me think of that but nonetheless, everyone deserves a second chance."

BernieSanders,ff9j5c9,t1_ff7h77l,1579714121.0,"I think she went into the debate knowing she was trailing behind Bernie. Her camp probably insisted that they needed something to pull ahead and this debate was the one to do it. Her track record for telling the truth hasn't been stellar but she has developed quite the base from most of the things she's running on. But her campaign is very similiar to Bernie's, and for a long time they've been considered good friends with a lot of the same policies so naturally people who supported Bernie supported Warren. The last debate imo showed some of her true colours though. She is working in the best interest of herself, and to try and stab Bernie in the back for her own political gain is just gross. At the end of the day I would bet that if she got the Nom, that Bernie would back her no problem. However, I don't think people will be as forgiving when it comes to voting. 

Either way, it was a dirty move on a long time friend and colleague. It was unnecessary and just proves that she will stoop to the same lows as previous candidates to try and win an election. It's actually quite ironic tbh.

Anyway I can't vote there anyway so I probably shouldn't care as much as I do lol but Bernie is a guy that doesn't come around often, and to see his potential get wasted because of greed, corruption and money would be serioiusly depressing."

Yes it hits all time highs all the time, that's the nature of the stock market but this is different. The spike in the last 4 years is pretty substantial when you compare it over a 20 year term.

But my tin foil hat tells me to believe that there's some serious manipulation going on and most likely Trump has something to do with it.

However, when she neutral'd her vote on impeachment I was less then impressed. Lost a bit of respect for her tbh. That being said I think she's had a rough go and doesn't deserve the amount shit that's been thrown at her. The fact Hilary can just come out and say she's a Russian asset without any proof or recourse is insane.

OurPresident,ff6rpu2,t1_ff66pzv,1579633488.0,"This will definitely have an impact. People respect Joe's opinion because of how calm and level headed he is. He's a good example  of how everyone should begin a topic with an open mind. Listen to the facts, assess the information, and make a decision based on said information. People are very quick these days to join a side. It's people like Joe that make you remember that it's important to hear both sides before you make conclusions.

That's what I take away from listening to Joe over the years and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Hearing that he is so confident enough to publicly say who he's voting for shows he has listening to both sides for the last while, and he's decided that in his opinion Bernie is the best choice, which he's right.

Good on Joe for using his platform the way he does. Much respect. Hope Bernie wins for you guys!"

It's an enormous rock mansion with a ton of property. There is great walk paths throughout the entire grounds and is open to public. It's centre right in the middle of Rockland that is a beautiful area surrounded by nice homes. 

It's actually incredible that they've kept it the way it is for so long. There is no where in Victoria like it because of where it's located. The city has grown tremendously over the last 20 years, yet the GG's grounds have stayed the same. Hopefully it never changes because my wife and I live a block away and we walk it often.

Anyway, I doubt they would move in because it's quite popular among locals who live in the area and it's a daily walk path for a lot of people, including myself."

That's what I think people fail to underetabd. Both parties are equally culpable. The entire system is smoke and mirrors. Only difference is Trump can't keep his mouth shut longer than 2 minutes because his ego is to strong.

This ain't new, hell, alot of the things Trump has continued to support isn't new. Only difference is that he is vocal as hell about it on Twitter and also blabs to people who shouldn't know the things he knows.

Not down playing that Trump is a piece of shit, because he is. Im simply saying that both parties are fucked and both have there best interest at hearts and not the American people. They've got you guys divided and fighting each other in this 2 party system and it just distracts you all from the reality of how fucked the system really is. If anything, Trump was the necessary evil to shine a light on how corrupt it all is.

Don't get me wrong, Obama did some good things but when he pushed back on the torture report and tried to bury it for his own political gain I lost a ton of respect for him.

I should add that there is one person I truly believe to be honest and probably best suited to run a country, Bernie. The guy has been spitting the same stuff for the last 30 years.

They were here visiting her mother whose lived here for awhile. I'm sure they both really liked it because the timing of this announcement is pretty interesting
news,fdojoo3,t1_fdodl25,1578606510.0,Well I mean we'd never be here in the first place if it wasn't for fucking ginger bread man over there.
bapcsalescanada,fdnnskq,t1_fdkfqn2,1578589620.0,"Ya 100%

Amazon doesn't know what to look for and people buying this monitor aren't going to settle for any type of imperfection because of Amazon's return policy, so you're almost guaranteed to be getting some sort of dead pixel/back light bleed panel."
VictoriaBC,fdm7saw,t1_fdm47wr,1578541905.0,"Seems crazy to me people are still getting gouged by Shaw/Telus. They have had so many promos these past few years that it's been ridiculously easy to leverage one over the other and get what you want.

I've been with Shaw for over 12 years now and my 2 year contract was up last year. They ended up giving me an expired deal for new customers. 

40/month for 300mbps down 50mbps/up with $300 bill credit.

Locked in for 2 years. The 2 yr contract before that was $45 for 150down 25up.

Anyway, point being is that if you don't want fibre and copper is what you're looking for, why not just bullshit your way into a 2yr contract with Shaw?"
bapcsalescanada,fdl7mpo,t1_fdkikvw,1578518425.0,"Yeah I think it may have been a glitch but amazon never really said.

It was a lightning deal but also prime day so when you added to cart it would take off another $60-70. It was a hell of a deal. I should of bought 2"
worldnews,fdku3qu,t1_fdkkw61,1578511187.0,"Nothing's going to happen with that. He's been impeached, and judging by how the votes fell(0 votes from Republicans), if I was a betting man, I would say that the chances of the Republicans removing him from office is less then 0%."
worldnews,fdktxi1,t1_fdkkw7k,1578511086.0,"Yup. This could of gone very differently and having him in office with the ability to pick which way it went is seriously horrifying. It's clear it was a political move to distract and gain support from his base. It started to look like he was hoping for an all out war, so  the fact that this was just a temporary political stint and he's not actually hoping to start ww3, I see it as a win even though it's completely fucked up."
UpliftingNews,fdknzyx,t1_fdgyq2a,1578507547.0,"Ok, so theoretically if someone makes 100 million, they will get taxed at a specific date in that 100 mill?

Was is that rate?

I just want to know how much someone who makes that amount of money is currently spending in tax."
bapcsalescanada,fdkgbaq,t3_elv3gb,1578503264.0,"I recently got a Amazon Warehouse deal, it was my first time.

Product was advertised as Very Good - Used.

Was a Lenovo flex laptop. It arrives and the LCD was cooked. It would flash a very faded Lenovo sign at first boot the go black. 

Contacted amazon and it was a bit of an annoying process but I asked them how it got through testing to get the 'Very Good' label. They said they must of missed it but anyone who would of turned the laptop on would of noticed immediately.

Anyway I dunno, I'll probably try another Warehouse deal at some point but I wasn't impressed."
bapcsalescanada,fdkg289,t1_fdkee9o,1578503111.0,"I got the mx500 that was on amazon last year. 2tb for $160. That's exactly what I use it for, it's great."
FortniteCompetitive,fdhlvet,t3_eihjym,1578425408.0,"I've said it before and I'll say it again. If you want to optimize fortnite, go to pnjano I think his name is? Anyway google pnjano fortnite chapter 2 optimization.

Go to the YouTube video and in the description he has a download from his Google drive. Follow the tutorial and do everything he suggests.

It literally gained me a RIDICULOUS amount of fps. The guys a genius and he didn't ask for donations at any point in his video"
nextfuckinglevel,fdh7ffz,t1_fdh1i3b,1578417008.0,"If I'm being honest it sparked something in me in which I am now searching on how I can donate to non profit agencies helping in the refugee crisis. So maybe that was the point? I dunno.

Anyway, that video made me feel a lot of different things in a very short period of time."
teenagers,fdh718q,t3_elbgqn,1578416763.0,"Good stuff, keep it up.

I don't want to seem insensitive and I don't mean to be if I am, but may I ask, was your weight gain primarily because of the diet you were raised on during your childhood? How much do your parents weigh?"
gaming,fdh69q2,t3_elasx0,1578416284.0,This just inspired me to do a second play through. Thanks!!
UpliftingNews,fdgveer,t1_fdgrvdd,1578409282.0,"Ok so I don't know a whole lot about the U.S tax system but I have heard that in some states, for example California, that a person's income tax can take about 50% of your income each year. To me that just seems insane? I live in Canada and we get taxed quite a bit but no where near that number. 

So I guess my question is, does the top 1% pay the same thing or is that just a tax bracket for middle class? Or is it because they have there companies registered somewhere other then the U.S? 

So I suppose Apple's tax each year would be quite a bit different then Tim Cooks. But is Tim Cook paying 50% on his income as well?

So are you guys saying he should pay more income tax, or the apple should pay more tax? Or both?!"
