PS4,ffji74z,t1_ffi70yh,1579998767.0,"XBox has Forza. IMO Forza Horizon 4 is far more enjoyable than Gran Turismo Sport, and sadly there doesn't appear to be a PS equivalent to that experience."
AskReddit,ffjg9i4,t3_ett7fr,1579997612.0,"My mom left our family when I was six-ish, my sister was two-ish. She told me dad didn't love her anymore. Over the years she constantly gaslighted us both, promising to spend time with us on weekends then standing us up. Eventually she didn't even have the time to make empty promises.

When I was 19, my dad died of cancer. I flunked out of college and mom was there to offer a spare bedroom until I could get on my feet. One night, after many Cooers Lights, she started railing on my dad, saying how he cheated on her all the time and beat her and how I was adopted and my sister was the product of an affair she'd had. 

How dare she? He was dead. He couldn't defend himself. More than that, **he was there**. She left a toddler with someone she claims beat her all the time? Quit your bullshit, mom."

Sorry, I don't follow that bass-ackwards line of thinking."

This is the same John Barrasso who earlier that day said that being at the Impeachment Trial was a waste of time.

> Every day spent on the impeachment of @realDonaldTrump is time not spent on what people actually care about. The longer Democrats drag this out, the longer it will take us to get to the work Americans want us to be doing. @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness. (7:47 AM Jan 24, 2020)

It's like everything they say is in bad faith. How the fuck did these scheisters get elected?"
news,ffh9gtt,t3_etjae7,1579926984.0,"> ""He asked if I could find Ukraine on a map I said, 'Yes,' he called out for his aides to bring him a map of the world with no writing, no countries marked. I pointed to Ukraine he put the map away, he said, people will hear about this, and then he turned and said he had things to do, and I thanked him again for his time and left.""

So on top of being a total piece of shit, he assumes everyone is as stupid as his boss tells them to be. Quality human beings here. /s"
politics,ffgi0sh,t1_ffg1czu,1579906689.0,"It's not the process people distrust, it's the people running it. Vote the traitors out, punish them appropriately for their individual treasons, and trust will be restored."
