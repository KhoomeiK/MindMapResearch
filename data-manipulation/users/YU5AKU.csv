Yes, I used to not be able to handle it at all but now all that the pain does is make me feel accomplished and eager to keep at it. Guess it just had to click. I'm not giving up this time for once. I already had it much easier today and I can't wait to see how it develops in the future.  

Thanks for your kind words, I'll keep at it!"

I managed to do 20 sit-ups the day before yesterday and some exercises with dumbbells that would normally be too much for my noodle arms. I usually quit and can't move on once the pain kicks in, but not this time. Yesterday I woke up not even being able to stretch my arms out from the pain and being forced to walk around like a T-Rex but it feels good, feels like validation. And in the evening I was doing better again and ready to some more exercising. Belly hurt like hell tho and I couldn't do a single sit-up (did even better with the dumbbells though). Didn't bother me tho. Not this time. I'm down with getting frustrated at everything and giving up. Today I'll try again."

LGBDropTheT,ffuw2an,t1_ffuv7r9,1580250424.0,Out of the ordinary can also mean weirdo or freak when used as an insult. I've heard people use it that way before. But of course it wouldn't. Cause I know what they mean. People will always define things the way they want. Like how racism is supposedly systematic oppression and not simply hatred towards a race. It's not like I'll pretend it doesn't mean something else to most people nowadays. I just find it stupid and backwards and I'm hoping for it to go back.
LGBDropTheT,ffuum5l,t1_ffumzzt,1580249644.0,"To me it just means ""out of the ordinary"" and has nothing (exclusively) to do with gender or sexuality. You know, like the actually meaning of the word and not people's headcanon. If you wanna normalize homo- and bisexuals, calling them queer would be kinda  counterproductive.  

What's even worse however is people who ""identify"" as queer or gendeequeer because they simply don't conform to gender stereotypes. Like no stfu."
