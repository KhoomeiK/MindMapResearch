Sanders will never do that. In fact, there's no one on that stage who would do that. Kamala Harris is the other one I feel could do something like that."

That's the most common scenario. You might need a couple of iterations to figure out whether you should have your employer deduct more or less from your pay as tax withholding (W4 form)."
