politics,ffnmqlv,t1_ffm0xln,1580067992.0,"This was my absolute first thought when i saw the video, pure knee-jerk ""How in the absolute shit did this get recorded!?"" I'm glad it did but holy OPSEC this should not exist. To say the DoD rules are strict on this matter is an understatement, I cant imagine trying something like this if my life wasn't on the line"
wholesomememes,fflay8j,t1_ffiqv6v,1580037320.0,"Oh it's the best, at least in terms of pedicure.  You sit in this big ass massage chair, you got your little table if you wanna bring in a drink, sit your feet in a bath of warm water, they scrape all the shit off your heels, pick at your toenails, rub your legs and feet, have some weird sandy gel shit(?) that makes your skin softer than hell, then, if you want, paint them up all nice.

I don't go in for the manicure since I keep my nails real short because I play stringed instruments, but I imagine it's not too dissimilar.

Like 8 years back I used to be the only guy in the place, these days I see all types, so be a man, get your feet fixed, get your nails did, took me a while to realize, being a man means I get some say in what that means."
wholesomememes,ffiqsft,t1_ffioh1y,1579980390.0,"My younger cousins used to do that as well, been a bit weird the last couple years not having painted nails over the holidays"
wholesomememes,ffiqhy8,t1_ffioy80,1579980187.0,"Yo, if you're not on the pedicure train yet, hop on now. Used to go monthly when I worked on my feet all day, dont even have to get them painted, but I'd hop off the chair and put my nicely cleaned toes and pushed cuticle into my work boots and off I'd go. Still go with my mom when I'm back in town"
rpg_gamers,ffiekzl,t1_ffhuavc,1579972004.0,"There's a pattern you can use that involves consistent strike points and a bit of timing, it's monotonous, but you only have to do it once"

There we have represented the exactly two sentiments on blitzball that exist.

All the rest, yes, was proper fun getting the 100% achievement on X.  X-2... is also a game that exisits?"
Terraria,ffhipk4,t1_ffhcs4d,1579937040.0,"I've played an expert world one without the glitch, one with, at least for expert it really doesn't make it easier.  I suppose it's easier to get ores (I mean you can just suicide those anyways), and slightly less time consuming to get favorable prefixes, but overall, nah, those fights are still an absolute killer.

For those curious it was the weird item rack stack-a-ma-jig, which means for you to be able to dupe you had to have two of something (STACKABLE!) minimum.  By the time you could dupe something truely useful like boss item bags.... you had to kill the thing at least twice, or three times if you wanted to press your luck to get a good drop on number 1 to try killing it again.

Was nice to build tons of stuff out of rare bricks without worrying about running out, but making the game significantly easier?  Not the way I did it."
AskReddit,ffasoxd,t1_ff8zgub,1579743591.0,"Sadly it doesn't help that scientific journals are really **REALLY** hard to read.  I have a psych degree, the VAST majority of my upperclassmen years were spent reading journal article after journal article, and even for someone in that field, who's done research, some of them are an absolute slog to get through.

And the sad bit is I don't know how to fix it.  We're already taught, ad nauseam, to make articles as short and succinct as possible, and it's still 10+ pages, a lot of them being statistics."
AskGames,ffar23s,t3_eshj13,1579742492.0,"***Oxenfree*** might be up your alley, I don't ever recall being chased or feeling like my characters were in direct danger, more of a cosmic sense of dread

Kind of off the wall, but ***Doki Doki Literature Club*** also might be something you'd be interested in.  Without spoiling too much it's deeply unsettling but very little ""danger"" so to speak.  Oh, and it's free!

In a slightly more ""classic"" horror sense that I'll add in because of the HL2 mention is ***Metro 2033*** and ***Metro: Last Light*** The whole setting is weird, unsettling and never really feels ""right"", and if you start poking around in some of the darker corners of the game it's downright terrifying, but not in a jump-scare ""gotcha"" sense, more that there's far more powerful players in the background that you can't control or fight."

DnD,ff2swlx,t1_ff2saxi,1579522764.0,"See I envy that, I can't do lore on a whim, so I somewhat obsessively plan it all out.  Encounters, sure do some weird shit, do something I didn't expect in my narrative, 10 minute break, I gotta retcon half the campaign"
DnD,ff2ss8k,t1_ff2sg6k,1579522608.0,"Oh man, the new 5e character shit has me studying like a final, it's.. strange coming from 3e and 4e, fighters get superiority die?  There's like 80 mage stat buffs?  It's challenging, but I'm really liking getting back into everything."
DnD,ff2sjt1,t1_ff2rytg,1579522305.0,"LOL I appreciate it, my old notes were... rough.  One of my oldest friends/players constantly brings up the time I said ""WTF is a Goblin Man 4+ LRF?  I guess roll initiative?""

The latter bit is our ""code"" for rolling out of the bar."
DnD,ff2rumo,t1_ff2rciw,1579521365.0,"Man/girl, every DM, EVERY DM has that first table, where they're nervous as hell, my advice, screw up early, that way you got that out of the way.  There's no way around this, you *will* have to retcon, you *will* railroad, and there's nothing inherently wrong with those mistakes.

If you're new and the players are new, man/girl just roll with the mistakes, have a beer, make jokes about holes in your lore.

In a practical sense, try to get your players to get you character sheets, it save a ton of ""Wait, what's or modifier on (X)?"" and, ""Okay, your AC is what again?"", other than that, try to feel the table.  You got a party of rogue, bard, barb, maybe a political/dialogue heavy go where the barb can be the muscle, like maybe a psuedo mob story, now I'm getting ideas.

But having a fighter/barb/warlock try to go through a campagin of INT checks is fun for no one, that kinda idea.

Be flexible, be fun, and really don't take it to seriously, I was a player for a long while before I was a DM, if the DM was into the story, let us do fun shit, it was a good session.  Sure, it might not seem like you can turn mummies wrappings into copper to paralyze them, but god damn if that spell description isn't vague as hell."
DnD,ff2qym2,t3_erc2bw,1579520097.0,"Finally got the 5e books, played a ton of 3e and 4e in the past, my brother's group needed a DM, so I'm back to writing.  These are all plot hooks, major NPCs, a way to remember how to roll against checks and the like.  The more astute amoungst you may recognize the story beats as literally NWN 1, Gothic, Dante's Inferno and AC2/Dishornoered in the ordering.  There's a larger story that each will tie back in to, but I don't have character sheets yet, don't have a table feel and I like options.  But I feel the occasional peek of the screen is something people might be interested in, I used to hand write these when I should've been paying attention in class (still don't understand calculus), but modern problems require modern solutions and all that."
thisismylifenow,feojfza,t1_fenyip5,1579300912.0,"I have like a legit 3M respirator and don't run into the fogging problem anymore.  Granted I think they're like $50, but if it's something you use frequently, totally worth it.  Now finding safety glasses that fit over other glasses, let me know if you find that.  Only thing I've found is ballistic glasses, which do the job, but they were way too expensive."
unpopularopinion,feo8cyt,t1_fenap8t,1579296492.0,"A while back my dad used to sit the board of a charity, my parents are fairly well off and used to take up christmas lists.  My mom would employ either me or my brother to fill out the lists.  Initially the lists were heart-breaking, coats, socks, shoes, and we'd get those but then fill in the rest with Lego sets, Nerf guns, action figures, like anything we would've liked as kids (My brother and I are adults and were out of the house at this point)

It was the highlight of my christmas season, just a trip to Target and picking out toys with my brother.  It was better than anything my parent's could have gotten me"
WTF,felw877,t1_fekygo8,1579232488.0,"As a fisherman and a chef, yep, that's not overly uncommon.  I can't remember the name of the disease but it does happen, and just like you said, the flesh just doesn't hold together like it should.  I just bin it and be glad it didn't die in the river/lake and infect other fish."

EntitledBitch,fdz152w,t1_fdxnqhv,1578785632.0,"I was once reported, formally, to my CO for ""refusing"" to salute an officer's wife (O3 I think?  Been a while) when she came to my office as well as for ""General Lack Of Respect"".  For the most part, the complaint was accurate, I did not salute her, refused to do so when asked and did not stand when she entered.

But here's the kicker, not only was she not an officer, I WAS A FUCKING CIVILIAN!  I was attached to a wing through the DoD, but not enlisted, not commissioned, I was just some DoD guy that worked on a military base.  My uniform was a black suit and my hair  was/is so entirely out of reg I somewhat often got called ""Ma'am"" by mistake by nervous new enlisted.

My colonel (who I also didn't salute) and I had a good laugh about it and he chucked the complaint.  Unreal"
DesignPorn,fdd91wo,t1_fdd6mty,1578300444.0,"My local has them around that for my old usual now. I think the last pack I bought was somewhere around $4.50(?), don't even remember what is was when I started, like $1.60?  I paid in change more than once so it couldn't have been much"
DesignPorn,fdd68zq,t1_fdbzgtd,1578296619.0,"Yeah, they started doing ""more aggressive warnings"" on packs before I quit, didn't do shit.  It's before work, I'm at the gas station, I tell my usual guy, ""Pack of reds"" just the same.  Cover the pack in whatever you want, I just want my morning cig.  Also I knew they were bad for me, like every other person on the planet, you start replying to ""Those things will kill you!"" with, ""Yep, that's the plan"".

Anyone curious it was pricing, fucking EVERYWHERE banning smoking and e-cigs that got me off them, nothing health related or ""clever"" packaging"
patientgamers,fdcqqq9,t1_fdcpfvq,1578281690.0,"Whoa, what?  Did you play the game?  It's not an ""odd mess"" it *is* a mess... by design.  You hop between realities that *could* be but aren't in the timeline assign to the Booker you play.  Booker Dewitt, the PC, never frees the slaves nor has a reason for doing so, you are *transported* to a reality where that's how it played out.  Booker, the PC, is a single minded asshole the whole game and is dismissive of who he has to kill because the reality he's in doesn't matter, he exhibits morality as a way of convincing Elizabeth to come with him, your own examples show this.  The stories, the struggles, the revolution exist *despite* Booker PC, not because of him, and only serve as more obstacles in his way, that's the point of the game, who you have Booker throw the baseball at in the beginning doesn't matter, the scene plays out the same, it's literally the point of the game that you're being railroaded, only Elizabeth can alter that path, and alters it by killing the PC in the end.

Of course people don't have arcs, they're not supposed to, you're jumping reality, it's a commentary.  If at any point of the story you thought Booker PC was the ""good guy"" you missed the entire point of the game."
Guildwars2,fcjqgtp,t3_ehjrwo,1577699476.0,"Oh, oh no, I feel I may contribute to this type of behavior.  I've been playing a LONG time, and I have my tags... I may or may not use them when I get drunk and want something done.  If you've ever been in a RIBA group and the comm starts using comm chat to shout garbage rap lyrics at you... hi!

I mean I do try my best (albeit drunk) to contribute to what I'm after, but I can't imagine I'm at my best in that moment."
