Advice,fczilwx,t3_ejp8mf,1578102052.0,"Not a lawyer, but I don’t think you have a good case. You blasted an air horn in his face, and into a speaker which connects directly to his ear. An air horn is 129 decibels which is enough to cause damage and could legally be considered battery. He could probably counter it with using self defense since the sound of the horn most likely startled him. 

I think you should re-evaluate what you believe to be a prank. They shouldn’t cause harm (intentional or otherwise) to the person getting pranked."

AskReddit,fc9to2k,t3_egtyx9,1577558065.0,"I live with my grandparents while I’m in college and I have my boyfriend over once a week (he lives an hour away). My grandparents always knock and wait for permission to be let in so I never worried about them walking in on us. The issue was with their dog. He’s a 10 month old yellow lab and despite being small for his breed, he can easily push my door open. At the time my door was broken so if you pushed hard enough it would pop open. 

One day I didn’t bother to put the dog outside or in his kennel and he got lonely since my grandparents weren’t home and my bf and I were in my room. The dog scratched a few times before ramming full force into the door, pushing it wide open. I can’t tell you how awkward it is to chase your dog out of your room naked after being startled half to death. Needless to say I got my door fixed and never had that problem again."
