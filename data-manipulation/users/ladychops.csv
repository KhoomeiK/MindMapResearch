Calgary,fcoy3ix,t3_ei1j2f,1577844775.0,A pharmacist may be your best bet. Calgary has been sharing some terrible cold and flues this season.  Unless you have phenomena the doctor won’t give you anything. If it’s cough and sore throat I agree with the Nightquil and sleep. I was out 2 weeks with fever and cough and I was told it’s influenza - can’t do much about that. It’s very rare to get antibiotics for a cold/flu here. Sorry you are sick!
AskReddit,fco4mqz,t1_fcntn68,1577823988.0,"I couldn’t agree more! As a HR person and senior manager myself, you did the right thing! I’ve had managers tell me that they can’t breach confidence and that is good enough for me. I trust my management team for that reason! I’m sorry you had a shitty team above you!"

AskReddit,fcjb031,t3_ehhc43,1577681767.0,"Sir. And then move on. If you don’t have anything nice to say, then don’t say anything at all."
aww,fcjauqb,t3_ehhcnc,1577681647.0,Floyd. I wanted to call my son this name but was vetoed by everyone.
aww,fc7e6f2,t3_egisn6,1577504770.0,Holy shit. Your dog is a splitting image of my old boy (passed and in peace) and he used to do the exact same thing! This post is the realist I’ve ever been on Reddit!!!
