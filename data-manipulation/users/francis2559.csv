insaneparents,fdo0zza,t1_fdnw6qm,1578596890.0,"The footnote in my NAB version is important here:

>The literal rendering, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated,”  suggests an attitude of divine hostility that is not implied in Paul’s  statement. In Semitic usage “hate” means to love less; cf. [Lk 14:26](http://www.usccb.org/bible/lk/14:26#50014026) with [Mt 10:37](http://www.usccb.org/bible/mt/10:37#48010037).  Israel’s unbelief reflects the mystery of the divine election that is  always operative within it. Mere natural descent from Abraham does not  ensure the full possession of the divine gifts; it is God’s sovereign  prerogative to bestow this fullness upon, or to withhold it from,  whomsoever he wishes; cf. [Mt 3:9](http://www.usccb.org/bible/mt/3:9#48003009); [Jn 8:39](http://www.usccb.org/bible/jn/8:39#51008039). The choice of Jacob over Esau is a case in point. 

It's a comparative thing.  God looks favorably on some people with a purpose (according to Paul) but expects less of others.

Hate = despise = ""away from "" + ""spy"".  It's really harsh in english but even in english we have this idea of just... looking away from someone.

It's difficult to reconcile with other scriptures for sure (""God knows when every sparrow falls,"" being quite famous) but you don't have to take it as predestination and most Christians don't.  Predestination introduces all kinds of other problems."

OP, you'd do well to read [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth\_of\_the\_clean\_Wehrmacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_clean_Wehrmacht) as well, that may help you round out your speculations."

politics,fdetthy,t1_fddswre,1578346463.0,"It’s a win win for Boris, I think.  It’s easy to highlight how bad this is.  Everyone agrees it is bad. It is because Trump is willing to do “bad thing” that his followers think he is strong.

By saying “this is VERY bad thing” you are appealing to liberals, but also making it more effective if he does it.

The response is such bullshit.  Saying “don’t do bad thing to them, or I will do bad thing to you,” would have more meaning.  Otherwise he’s just pouring gasoline on while risking nothing personally."

I think many of these were extensions of highspeed bomber technology (also replaced by ballistic missiles) or recon (obsoleted largely by anti air missiles and satellites).

If you can't sell it to the military, then it's too expensive to develop."

Separately you can deceive someone with the truth, and you can be wrong with no intention to lie at all.

In the end the result is the same though, I just assign blame differently."
