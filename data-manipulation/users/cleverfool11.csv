However, changing speed will also affect both.  Going faster will increase the pitch as frequencies are increasing.  If you were to go slower than 55 it would decrease the tempo and pitch.   Actually thinking about it, I'm not sure if the key would change completely.  Im thinking it would be more of a pitch shift, than key change.  It is possible to figure out what speeds would produce an actual key modulation, but I'm to busy (lazy) atm to do the math.

Also, the code for M and N is a seahorse with a golden rectangle and spiral on it, and ive had a golden rectangle tatt for a while.  The show and glyphs always resonated with me in weird ways.  What hinted to me it was a code is that some of the glyphs are almost the same, but different in a small way.  Then I realized the little balls of light were positioned in different spots related to the image and was sure it was a code.  Plus the show is just cool like that.  I didn't solve the code myself, i cheated and googled it.  It turns out, the series of glyphs shown during the episode spelled out a word that was the theme of that episode (generally). so cool.
