I’m not going to apologize for saving money.  An it’s not an entire 2nd house, it’s a down payment on house which I will still have make a mortgage payment on. And whenever that house isn’t being rented I’ll be making two entire house payments. It’s not going to be easy.

2) How does me buying a home from someone else have any effect on that? Rental properties sure as hell aren’t raising property values in an area.  When I find a house I want to get as a rental property I’m not paying more than market value. Nothing else is stopping anyone else from buying that same house"
fuckthesepeople,ff3su62,t1_ff3qe2d,1579548101.0,"First off having more homes doesn’t a mean a homeless person is owed one of those vacant homes. Someone owns it can do whatever they want with it. 

But having that many empty homes (which nowhere near all of those are rental properties) just proves my point. If someone took the gamble to buy it but can’t rent it out because of the competition of having so many rentals available that is a risk they took on and are in fact losing money each month.  

If I have a rental property in a decent neighborhood with good property values and I am having trouble renting it out of course I’d lower the rates. Any landlord would have to, they aren’t trying to price people out. What I would not do those it let a person that has $0 in income stay there and if you say you would you are full of shit."

If that works out I may bust my ass again to save up another deposit for a 3rd place and do it all over again. I don’t really see how that makes me evil. People need cars, food, and electricity and they have to pay for all of those things. No different that paying for a roof over your head"

When this is the case they can go to a landlord and stay in their property for a monthly fee (which in a lot of cases is less than their mortgage payment would be)

And I would say very few people are paying half to two thirds of their salary on rent.

And they are “doing” something. They are taking the risk by putting up the capital for purchasing the home. If the home isn’t being rented, it still needs to be insured and taxes paid on it. They have the risk of not being paid by their tenants (who should pay for damages to home).  When that home needs a new roof or gets a termite infestation, that’s another major problem and money hit the homeowner pays.

It’s just like any other investment. My 401k is growing and making me money by me “doing nothing” but I am taking the risk it will grow and losing out on other things I could do with that money, but I’ve decided that’s the investment I wanted to do"

I wouldn’t say zero chance the wolf beats a guy. Good chance the dude comes out with scars.

Think about how a real one on one fight would go. A wolf would lunge and try to bite the first thing it could. The wolf probably had a much higher pain tolerance than the person but if it doesn’t land it’s bite, a person knows this and understands the weakness of the eyes or ribs or holding the mouth. A grown man weighs close to twice what a wolf weighs. A wolf can’t kick or punch, its mouth is the only thing that is a threat.

If you are about to use any police dog as an example, the catch with that is the police are there and the dog doesn’t give a fuck. That’s what makes them so effective. If you have a hostage and a gun to their head, you can negotiate with a person but if they let the dog loose at you, there is only a few options and bad guy loses every one
