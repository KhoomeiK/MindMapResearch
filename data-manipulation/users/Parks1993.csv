PowerMetal,ffvqaup,t1_ffvkl2m,1580270297.0,"Gloryhammer is the closest. Sabaton and Powerwolf are closer to just like...idk, heavy metal or poppy metal but get lumped in to the genre. Sabaton and Powerwolf don't sound anything like what you'd traditionally think of as power metal such as early sonata arctica, early edguy, Dragonland, Dragonforce, Hammerfall, Blind Guardian, Derdian, Domine (I could go on). Not saying I dislike them, I listen every once in awhile. It's just hard to call it straight up power metal"

PowerMetal,fft9v9e,t1_ffsxh3k,1580213772.0,100% agreed. Or they didn't start liking power metal until 2015 and only listen to Gloryhammer and Sabaton and Beast in Black and Powerwolf. Three of these are arguably not even what is traditionally known as power metal. My advice to anyone is to go listen to the God damn essentials list on the sidebar of the subreddit. I'm glad Blind Guardian and Dragonland made the top four but they are MILES ahead of Gloryhammer in terms of songwriting and composition. Chris (who wrote the Gloryhammer album) doesn't even think it comes close to AOTD.

Seahawks,ff5qge3,t1_ff5m4b7,1579606070.0,"I was born in Seattle in 1993. Didn't get into football until the Seahawks were making headlines around 2012 and my dad was talking about how good they are and Russell and stuff. Since then I've become a fan of both NFL and college, watch Redzone every week, my TV is locked to NFL Network or any channel playing football. I watch the draft. I read mocks. I became a football fan, not just a Seahawks fan. Calling me a bandwagoner would be incorrect. If the Seahawks went to shit again I wouldn't stop loving the game. I just discovered that I love the game later in life.
