You will want a layer of plywood between the TNG sub floor and decoupling mat. Not sure that I'd use luan. It's going to follow the sub floor and all of it's nuances. I'd go with 1/2"" cdx. Unfortunately with a TNG subfloor, you're going to have a small lip from hardwood to tile. Floor tile can range from 1/4"" - 1/2"" in thickness. You can then use a t-mold (or variant) at the transition."
DIY,ff9q5l4,t1_ff9gls3,1579718492.0,"This may not be the best idea. In older houses, especially ones with car decking (2x6 tongue and groove) sub floors, they often span 4' between beams. There probably aren't your typical 16"" on center floor joists that you see in newer houses. So removing the TNG isn't a viable option unless you want to add a bunch of new joists. However, if you notice any deflection in the TNG, you'll need to add support. Typically, you'd want to screw down the TNG with appropriate screws, scrape/sand off any high spots and add plywood with glue and screws. Then you have two options.

One, use 1/4"" cement board or equivalent. I prefer Wedi or Hardi. Mortar and screw according to directions.

Two, use a decoupling mat. Follow the directions.

Option two will give you the better result for a longer lasting floor, the mat is designed to absorb the movements of your sub floor, preventing cracks in your tile/grout lines.

Use the appropriate mortar for the tile you're installing. 

Once your tile is in, I'd use a urethane or epoxy grout. Urethane and epoxy cost a bit more than cement grout but have benefits that far outweigh the cost difference. Urethane grout is easier to use than epoxy, but takes longer to cure."
DIY,ff9ofwq,t3_ese46s,1579717268.0,"The issue you run into is movement in the subfloor. You're better off with a thicker plywood vs concrete board. The plywood gives you a flat surface, the concrete board gives something for the tile to adhere to. A better option where you're concerned about subfloor movement is to use a decoupling membrane. This separates the tile from the subfloor.

Ideally, your finished tile height should be as close to the finished floor height in the hallway."

Plan 1 is far better than plan 2 just for usability but also for relocating your drain/waste/vent lines.

Your current pluming stack is in the wall of the stair well. The new toilet location is the hardest one to relocate because you need a 3"" drain and depending upon the direction and height of your floor joists, you may be limited where you can put it to keep it within the floor and not protruding from the ceiling below. If your floor joist go from left to right, plan 1 shouldn't be too difficult and you probably won't need a new vent. (12' max for 3"" line at 1/8"" slope, 16' for 4"" line at an 1/8"" slope). Plan 2 would be a pain in the ass to get to the stack and you'd probably need a new vent through your roof. In either plan, you may need a new vent stack for the sinks and tub. Max distance for 2"" drain line to the vent stack is 8' at 1/4"" per foot slope. Change the slope and your max distance gets shorter. Whomever is redoing your pluming needs to know this stuff as your DWV system is the most complex part of the pluming. Studor vents are a last resort.

For plan 1, if you're tight on space for the vanity/toilet, the privacy wall doesn't need to be a 2x4 wall. If you're going tile, use a 2"" Wedi board. Or glass. A good remodeler should have some ideas."
