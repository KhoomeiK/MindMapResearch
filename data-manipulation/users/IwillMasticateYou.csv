creepyPMs,fehqow3,t1_fehh6sw,1579121965.0,"I was in the exact same boat. Met the guy of my dreams, so I thought. More and more slowly started being manipulative. But ive always been a strong, confident girl so I knew it wouldnt get out of hand. It was like 5 months together before my parents called me saying they were worried about me. And it wasnt until multiple separate people had to speak up for me to realize it. It can happen to anyone.

I tell my friends snipets of things he did. For e.g.. Pulling me away during a party to argue about something I did wrong and have to console him. And friends would say, oh I would never put up with that. I never thought I would either. But you just don't know what its like to be in an emotionally abusive relationship. You love them and they love you too so you dont think the worst of them.

Please dont be hard on yourself for falling for them. That's their trap. They don't start the relationship on their worst behavior. They slowly build up to it so youre used to it."

I was a young girl too once and enjoyed the attention. Its just not safe. You could accidently drop some crucial information and they could find you. Say you told him, my school won last weeks football game. He could find out what school you go to by looking it up. There is no way for a young person to safely message people they don't know.

AskWomen,fedpgnm,t3_eofn21,1579017050.0,"In a round about way, I started to feel sexier when I cooked for myself. I started cooking all my own meals purely because it was the cheapest option. I also biked like 10-20 minutes a day, not even a lot. I didnt lose a single pound but my clothes just started to fall off me. I had to wear a belt everyday just to keep them on. Then I went to the thrift store and bought all new jeans. Clothes started to fit me that I never thought I could wear again. So that made me feel sexier. I wore tighter clothes instead of covering up and hiding my body in baggy clothing. Being a tall girl, ive always been big, especially bigger than my friends. I never felt skinny in my life. Once I felt good about myself I noticed more attention too. And I think it was less being skinnier but more being confident in myself. Around that same time I had a small group of girlfriends who we all started sharing classy nudes with each other. I had never done that before and it was a lot of fun. Especially so because when its your friends they arent looking to bone you but they can tell you you're sexy and they mean it."

I feel like this posts comments are split between people who have anxiety and can sympathise with OP and people who dont have anxiety and can see how intense it gets. Ive been on the receiving end of texts like this and it feels very untrusting and codependent. He absolutely should have communicated better and just said, cant talk tonight how about tomorrow. Who knows how OP would have taken that though. My ex would have refused and demanded a FT. OP should have also trusted her SO to be safe and let him enjoy his evening.

OP I recommend reading Codependent No More. You might not realize what behaviors are toxic to relationships and mental health."
thesims,fdkaoz5,t3_elrbnv,1578499869.0,"I love it! I have this trick with plants that helps them look more realistic. I change the way each one is facing.

PsychedelicWomen,fdh3d7y,t3_elc0yu,1578414505.0,"I'm not sure if it was psychedelic use or just maturing but I slowly started to wear less and less make up. First I didnt wear it to class but I would wear it out to parties or outings. Then I just stopped in general.

Its funny how you say you will have less success dating without makeup on but I dont think that's true. I think it comes from confidence. I am fair and have blonde hair and eyelashes and I been wearing mascara since I was 14. I used to not be able to leave the house without it! I dont think wearing make up or not has any effect on boys.

I say, wear make up if *you* want to and also be okay with yourself if you dont wear it."

I had this same fixation with it and thats why it was so hard to quit. Especially because all my roommates smoked. Its not a great solution but I picked up vaping instead. I had very low nicotine. I did 3 mg but you could do none. It 100% helped me quit weed. It had taken a year without the vape and almost immediately once I got it. They also make CBD pens. Just don't get them mixed up because that's the problem with all these vaper's lungs. Theyre putting CBD cartridges in nicotine vapes.

It took me about 3 years to quit Vaping but I think all it took was moving out of college."
