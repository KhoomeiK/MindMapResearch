I guess my point is all these guys (not you) who are up in arms about my post seem to have no problem giving all the credit in the word to the choker having perfect technique but the guy being choked having none, thus any size/strength disadvantage is mute. That's just not typical or realistic."

The context here is most definitely untrained individuals.

If we weigh the impact of the three categories on extremes, then size and strength are indeed more of a factor. Now if the disparity between two fighters in terms of size and strength are minute, then obviously technique will prevail.

The fact that professional fighters have weight classes is supportive of this. If you could combine the greatest striker and best bjj into a single fighter who's medically dwarf, and out them up against halthor bjornnsson in a must win fight, who is going to win?

Second, orange definitely puts top spin on the ball. This is the trickiest part and caused me to watch over and over. There's simply no way he put backspin on it. 

Third, because of the lack of backspin how does the ball bounce back toward orange? Looking at grey and the weird angle of the ball it seems to hit something off camera that makes the ball come down and back towards orange.

Freewill isn't at stake here. We force doctors and hospitals by law to provide care.

I think phrasing this debate as ""forcing"" is convoluted and is a bit of a straw man. The fact of the matter is healthcare providers are at some level, altruistic. They aren't the ones who are against treating people, it's the insurance industry. Some healthcare workers are against healthcare for all because of fear of loss wages. In reality the massive amount of money spent on healthcare is by insurance companies who are charged multitudes more than necessary. This is done to recoup losses from healthcare providers when they must provide care even when a patient has no insurance. This extra cost is in turn charged to us by the insurance companies through increased premiums, deductibles, etc.

For example: I had lapse in insurance between jobs. My son was due for his first round of vaccinations. My healthcare  provider said I could pay out of pocket, about $280. I signed up for Obamacare JUST for my son for 1 month, $140. Paid a copay of $40. So I saved $100. My insurance claim came out to be a whopping $960. 

The doctor's office could cover their costs if I paid out of pocket for less than $300 but when they bill insurance companies, it's more than 3X the price.

This is long winded way to get to my final point about healthcare providers worrying about losing money. If we switched to a completely no-insurance plan and everyone paid out of pocket, healthcare workers would overall lose money. They are literally sustained by the exorbitant amount of money they can charge insurance companies. These insurance companies can afford to pay those astronomically high prices by passing the cost on to John P. Everybody. 

It's a system where the two parties that benefit are not the party which needs care. If this isn't inherently immoral I'm not sure what is."

By the refusal and avoidance of going into specifics for your reasoning, I can only conclude my suspicion of you being a troll is justified."
TheExpanse,fcyl6je,t1_fcyk83z,1578082032.0,"I asked why you thought it was dumb. A huge portion of my response was regarding that. I asked for examples, trying to engage in conversation. But instead you bypass everything I said and focused on the one sentence about you being a troll.

I brought up you trolling in regards to all your responses to folks on here. 

Your OP said it was dumb and unbelievable and mentioned plot holes. I asked for YOUR examples and you copypasta a bunch of YouTube videos? Did you even watch the show or are you just trying to regurgitate talking points from some videos?

I specifically pointed out the ""believability"" aspect, and zero response. That's why I called you a troll."
unpopularopinion,fcykc61,t3_ejde9m,1578081569.0,"There's always been a ""pop music"" of cinema. That's just how media (shows, music, movies, books, etc) work.

There's always something that the general casual public really enjoys, hence the term ""pop.""

Before superhero movies it was ""blockbusters"" James Bond, Die Hards, Rambo's, Predator, Termination, Mission Impossible,  Speed, etc. Big budget and big marketing for easy to ingest content that was entertaining. Before that you had westerns galore. Somewhere in there were mysteries and also ""monster of the week"" films.

It's just the nature of pop culture. You can't say it's any worse that other time frames. Sure we look back and say Die Hard was awesome, but that's just because it came to be when you were also into that current pop culture. But the generation of Western lovers didn't much like it.

The same analogy can be applied to the Beatles, Rolling Stones, etc.

Tldr: its the equivalent of pop music. It's not necessarily bad, a huge portion of the population enjoys them."

You must be real thick or extremely uneducated to say TE has ""good science.""
They are equally unrealistic.

I love the expanse (books), way more than Mandolorian, but I dont see any convincing rationale for your claim. The basis of which ""taking place in the expanse universe, things make sense,"" which can equally be applied to Mandolorian. I.E. in the starwars universe, it makes sense.

Subject both to reality, both are equally unbelievable.

Though, from all your responses it's quite obvious you're a troll."

Here's a much better idea: Force all Reddit users to provide government issued IDs, thus revealing personal identities of all users. Without anonymity, people will have to actually own the bullshit they spew.

That would also be the quickest way of killing the website, but probably worth it."

unpopularopinion,fckb5sc,t3_eh7rul,1577721342.0,"Some of your figures are off. The general idea is initial costs of building a PC is roughly the same as a new console. PS4s and Xbones were $500 when they came out. 

I built my PC three years ago for under $400. With an i3-7100 and GTX 1050. I can play a ton of games at 1080p at 120fps, not 60. If I spend $150 I can upgrade my GPU to a 1650 super and play any games on ultra settings.

Then there's the multi-use factor. I needed a PC for work and other general internet use. I guess I could've bought a laptop, but I wanted dual monitors. If you don't want to be stuck on your phone for all internet related musings you're buying a laptop for $200+. Thus making your console+laptop now at over $700.

As for availability of games, PC has loads more. As for AAA limited releases, you can argue that PC has the most played games (minecraft, fortnite, Apex) way before they came to console.

I was a console guy for 30 years, then all my friends I played with basically dwindled down and stopped playing. At that point it was more pragmatic and economical to switch to PC.

In 10 years, I'll have spent less than $650 on a PC that runs any game I want. In that same time frame I would've spent at least $1000 on console. Add more if I wanted a laptop.

Edit: meant to talk about download/install times. You're way off. I just downloaded/installed/updated Monster Hunter World and Witcher 3 (+dlcs) in less than 1.5 hours. I have 100/10 internet."

>Every media station is a propaganda tool for the left or the right

This is an opinion.

Just as it is my opinion that nothing will convince you otherwise due to an obvious bias. You say a media outlet is bias and when faced with a website that quantifies such things you say the mere existence of such a site proves you right?

That's like saying because there are websites solely devoted to debunking antivaxxers or flat Earth then that means flat Earthers and antivaxxers are on to something! Otherwise why would those sites saying they're wrong even exist."
