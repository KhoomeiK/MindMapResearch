You're probably just training much different than me. You most likely run all fast short workouts like speed work, short tempo runs and intervals. I run about 6 miles per day mostly at a moderately easy pace with slow paced long runs on weekends.

AdvancedRunning,ff8g752,t3_es25gr,1579677060.0,"I don't think extra recovery time is the issue. I think certain aspects of winter running such as extra layers, and snow make me work harder, so I need to adjust my pace to maintain the same level of training.

I did a slow 14 mile run the other day with at least 5 of those miles through 6 inches of slush and standing water, and the other 9 with nasty wind and freezing rain. Normally a slow 14 mile run would be fine for me, but I had muscle pain in my legs for a few days after. Nothing serious and I didn't feel injured but my legs felt like they got worked a lot harder than a slow 14 mile run should work them.

I needed to factor in extra recovery time due to running on snow and ice. I also think wearing extreme amounts of layers that single digits require works my body a little bit harder. I have to adjust my pace a little slower if it's extremely cold and I'm wearing thick pants or multiple upper layers. 

If I'm trying to push hard workouts at my summer pace wearing 3x the amount of clothes I'm going to feel pretty worked. I adjust my pace a little slower and watch my heart rate to compensate."

Those things are probably too advanced for a brand new dueler.

AdvancedRunning,fdd75xh,t3_ekmnrv,1578297812.0,"The 9 mile loop at Waterfall Glen is a good place for long runs or mid-week runs with some hills. There are groups that do long runs on that trail every weekend that you can join up with. There are also some very hilly running trails through the forest preserve east of there. If you're downtown and can't or don't want to drive that far to run, you can at least do some hill interval repeats or loops with a hill using the sled hill at montrose. That won't give you a boston sized hill but it's probably better than nothing.

Track your mileage increase closely. A few years ago I got busy and wasn't logging many miles, then I overdid it trying to prepare for the Chicago marathon quickly. I jumped my mileage from 20mpw to 40mpw very quickly and I ended up injured for over two years. I still haven't regained the fitness that I had going into that time. That was an incredibly costly mistake."
