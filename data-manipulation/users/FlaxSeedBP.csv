06 – That said, she looks though and a great fighter. Boxing Kangaroo Hero would fit her better. 

05 – Unfortunately, that Mirko last page looks like the Prelude to an Announced Death.

04 – Lastly, she was one of the heroes who changed category in this episode. From footnote to foot crashing everything and disputing the protagonism of #260

03 – The other hero is Present Mic. From comedy relief to tormented man with traumatic past in a couple of lines. Now we believe he can go, like he promised, “full karaoke” on the villains. Well done, Horikoshi

02 – Worrying Hawks cameo is worrying

Fun fact: my therapist asked me to make a ""super-hero pose""in front of the mirror and say positive things about myself. I felt ridiculous and gave up on the second day. A few days later a relative was trying to get something on a top shelf and I, being taller, rushed to help and said, without thinking:

""No worries, I am here.""

Since that day I try to infuse a bit of All Might on my actions. And, darn, the ""I am here"" atitude works. Makes me focus on the others, no time to get into the Depression negative circle of thoughts."
