Collectors of some sort - Military surplus trading is big around military bases I've been to, one with as much gravitas and history as Pearl Harbor would likely bring in all sorts of military collectors. It's possible they bought a ""dud round"" or ""practice round"" and were told it was safe but were given a regular round by mistake, ignorance, negligence, whatever. 

If it's the first one, that's ballsy. Attacking an American military base on American soil is a great way to get your buddies droned out of their cave (assuming they are associated with an organization like Al Qaeda or something)."

No idea what the police's enforcement policy is. You should check with your local PD. Put your guns in a safe if you have one. Also get a lawyer, talk to them about your concerns and start putting the evidence together that you're a sane and normal person. Psychologists can give you a ""clean bill of health"" for your mental state, and if anyone does try to get your guns grabbed just be ready to sue the tits off them.

AmItheAsshole,feduzof,t3_eom8mh,1579020465.0,"NTA - Never, ever, work for free. In some places OT is encouraged to get things done. I know in retail, especially at big corporate stores, that OT hours/hours in general are closely regulated as a performance metric for the entire store.

&#x200B;

When I worked at PetSmart we had a series of metrics including turnover, shrink/waste, sales, hours usage etc. that contributed to an overall ""grade"" or ranking of how our store was operating compared to others. OT was discouraged because it meant that those hours had to be made up somewhere else to stay within the budget the store was given by corporate (stupid as fuck, a waste of peoples time, and frankly led to more problems than it solved. But hey money talks right?).

&#x200B;

In different settings sometimes OT is necessary to get things done by deadlines etc. But always you should be compensated for it.
