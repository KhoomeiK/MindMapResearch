AmItheAsshole,fff9we5,t3_et970f,1579879278.0,Draw a picture of her crapping her pants. And when she comes over to interview and do her ridiculous spiel everyone should completely ignore her existence while holding up their drawings.
AmItheAsshole,feees02,t1_fedj346,1579032262.0,">NTA- this person was clearly never your friend. A friend would not date your relatively recent ex and if for some bizarre reason they did, they wouldn’t announce it on social media. They would come to you hat in hand and beg for understanding.

No, a friend would come to you BEFORE the relationship starts to talk about it. FTFY

But seriously, NTA. You need to talk to your friend group while she is apparently going on to them all about how wounded she is by you. Tell them the situation and why shes a bitch, why you don't want to be around her or them. The one that told you to make it right may come around to your side, the others may side with you as well. Who knows, but at least you will discover if you need to look for new friends."
movies,fedjdgx,t3_eoiffq,1579013012.0,"I am glad you added you don't think it is a movie for everyone. I love the Joker, and loved him in the Joker... but I really was not fond of You Were Never Really Here. I  didn't get any gratification at all from that movie, not even delayed. But i will fully admit I typically am not a big fan of more Art House type movies (HATE The Lighthouse)."

Hair,fe072s9,t3_enhkv7,1578804762.0,You look like the future child the movie didn't show of Westley and Buttercup from The Princess Bride. Which is amazing in every way.
JUSTNOMIL,fdzzk7a,t1_fdzfbsf,1578799547.0,"Well, If your husband tries to overrule you and let her move in maybe you and the kids should move in with BIL."
personalfinance,fdsb4wm,t3_emuxoa,1578698552.0,"When I bought my first new car, it was only my name on the title. I was still able to be on my dad's insurance though. I remember my insurance card for that car had both of our names on it. The cards for all the other cars just had his name"
AmItheAsshole,fdrsw3q,t1_fdrbs82,1578689228.0,"Same here. And my friends will usually only borrow a shirt, jacket, maybe dress. Pants have always been off limits.

NTA. Tell her if shes trying to get thick its working and she looks good, but she cant share your pants anymore."
AmItheAsshole,fdpdxkx,t1_fdo6bim,1578626168.0,No chicken. Just pickles... That one may have been thrown at him though. Hopefully he's quick to duck.
HarryPotterBooks,fdk3c4v,t1_fdivuwq,1578495046.0,They may have been referring to the movie? In it Crouch Jr tries to run after being snitched on for being a death eater and participating in the torture. Can't remember if he tried to run in the book though.
aww,fdgrt9o,t1_fdgnaam,1578406676.0,Most likely. My brother paid for a golden retriever from a breeder and I think they may have called it adopting too. Saying adoption does sound better than saying you just bought a dog from them.
aww,fdgmsar,t1_fdgk75j,1578402541.0,"Hmm.. I think when its a rescue? I adopted my dog as a puppy from a rescue, but still had to pay for him (covered his vet bills/ neutering/ food). I think I payed like $250, which goes to helping them take care of other dogs."
AmItheAsshole,fdfdhrc,t1_fdeqkuy,1578359135.0,"No. He said in a comment that he sent his mom a dick pic that was sent to his girlfriend as part of their conversation. He didn't take a new one just to send to his mom. Had he sent his mom the chat logs between him and the gf she would have seen this pic anyways. 

Little better. Still gross. ESH, though I can definitely see why he was so pissed and gave up with his mom."
HumansBeingBros,fdcg5mp,t3_ekjpj5,1578274081.0,The title just makes me want to sing the owls song from The Fox and the Hound.
AmItheAsshole,fclioo3,t1_fcl4su6,1577748699.0,"Look. I can see how I look like an ass with that comment. I have no problem with people being vegans. Have tried some vegan food myself with mixed results. I could never live with a vegan lifestyle  but props to the people who thrive on that. (Also, as a non religious person I have no problem with people being raised muslim.. Not that it's in any way related)

I hope if they ever do have kids, when the kid is old enough they get a choice to try and eat meats and she doesn't give the child a vegan ultimatum as well. 

But I'm just a moronic fuck who doesn't know her, their relationship, or the future and has no influence on their lives... Just like you."
AmItheAsshole,fcjyyif,t1_fcjwtn9,1577711081.0,I am more worried about those values being forced on any possible future children.
gifs,fcc6ry8,t1_fcahb8l,1577595042.0,Also a sexy voice always helps.
aww,fc7h3y3,t1_fc6sqy0,1577507258.0,That would be hilarious to name them lol. Unfortunately the white one is already named Wilber.
assassinscreed,fbvjflq,t1_fbvaufs,1577131667.0,"I found it weird, but entertaining enough when I decided to not think of it as an assassins creed movie. It just another action movie."
