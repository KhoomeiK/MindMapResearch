AskReddit,ffmjh6q,t3_eu6iol,1580055533.0,"One time long before Google we used to use a search engine called hotbot. We had a computer room where we all played games so that we could keep an eye on the kids. My son was young pre-teen. Back then meta tags embedded in websites were what search engines used to find results. So porn sites used to use common words & phrases so that they would be top of the search list. My son searches “Star Wars” like a normal kid of the 90s and this nude lady, spread eagle, in a full gynecological position pops up. My son says “how do I get this off of my screen?” And my husband without missing a beat says “son one day you will be asking me how to get that on your screen”."

AskReddit,ff55spr,t3_ergjyj,1579581041.0,"This customer came in to Kohl’s I worked in the jewelry dept. we had decorations up for the holiday. She was pushing a stroller with her grandchild in it. He kept grabbing everything within reach and pulling it down. She noticed every once in awhile. She then came to the counter and purchased a 14kt gold necklace. We were out of regular size bags and jewelry gift boxes. I said “would you like me to tape the receipt to the item?” She insisted she needed a bag. I said “I can put it in this bag but it is huge” I pulled out a really large bag. Just then her grandchild starting pulling our Christmas displays down. “she said just put it in the bag with the receipt”. So I did and handed her the bag, 
The next day she comes stomping in the store. She is yelling at me telling me I didn’t give her anything but the receipt. I tried to calm her down but she called me a thief and asked for the manager. The manager heard her yelling and walked up to us. The lady yelled making the same accusations. The manager called loss prevention and asked them to review the jewelry camera. Sure enough I had placed it in the bag. My manager explained that to her and then she pulled the bag out of her purse and said “look! Look for yourself!!” So my manager did and there it was at the bottom of the bag. My manager said “this? This necklace?” The lady looked at me and said “well why the hell did you put it in such a big bag?” Then she stormed off without an apology. I was livid! My manager then says “next time put it in a smaller bag” I said “we are out!” He then says “well put it in a gift box then” now I’m getting pissed off “we are out of those too!” So my manager in all his wisdom replies “Fine! Then tape the receipt to the jewelry” wish I had thought of that."

Her uncle was supposed to take money my parents left for her so she could go to college but he never paid the bill. They put a financial freeze on her and she couldn’t afford to finish college. So she works 2 jobs. Her car was totaled in a car accident and while she had insurance it only paid off the loan. She borrowed money to get another job. She still isn’t making enough money to quite make rent but she tries so hard. She has an interview as a flight attending at the end of the month. But her account is over drawn and when I can I help her out. She’s such a good person. If you helped her you would be helping me.

I was dreaming that we were playing pool. We were playing doubles which we did often back in the day. I was looking over the table to see what was the best shot and what kind of English etc. I’m not good at English but I still try so I can get better. My husband got impatient and said “Honey, go! Honey! Honey!” And then I said out loud in real life while still asleep. “Hang on! I’m looking for a shot!” And then my husband said out loud “what did you say?” I repeated myself and he said “why did you say that?” I explained what I had been dreaming about. He then told me he was having the same dream and had said to me to go because he was tired of waiting for me to shoot. That never happened again but it still really freaks us out to think about it."

poshmark,feofn14,t1_feoez9y,1579299545.0,"Yep. That was after Jade asked for $13,000. I get that Jade is legally right. But I also get that she missed a huge opportunity.

poshmark,feocydv,t1_feoc63g,1579298388.0,I think both communicated horribly. But I would have fostered a relationship and so to say no one would want to is not true.

poshmark,feoay8s,t3_eq2l4w,1579297572.0,"Unpopular opinion here too but what was Jade thinking? She had an opportunity to make WAYYYY more than $13,000 by fostering a relationship with WWW. I have worked with a celebrity or 2 being in California and reselling for about 30 years. She could have said “let me send you my COG with a mark-up for my time etc. But, I would normally sell these for $Xxx and I don’t want to ruin your launch but how about maybe you let me buy some of your items from your own closet that you no longer wear or maybe we do a little collab on IG??” This was an opportunity to help another business woman AND help herself to a valuable fashion connection!!!"

TrueCrime,fefvaa1,t3_eovgbt,1579066335.0,"I remember as a kid a Brady Bunch episode where Bobby thinks Jesse James is badass. I remember thinking WTF? Why does he think that guy was so awesome? (Well I was a kid so it was more like - what the heck?) 
In the episode an old man comes on and tells Bobby what a freaking coward Jesse James was. How he shot people in the back. I couldn’t wrap my head around a few things 1) did people really think murderers were all that? 2) did it matter that he shot them in the back? 

I now know that the answer to 1) is yes. Sadly, people are so fucked up. 
2) while shooting people in the back means you are a coward to a lot of people, in my mind shooting innocent people face to face is just as cowardly. Murdering people is cowardly. But I get where the back makes it even more disgusting. 

Fuck murderers!"
