wildhockey,fh7aja8,t1_fgzi3i0,1581321953.0,Almost every team good or bad has teams that they always have trouble beating. Det has beat Bos 5 times in a row which is nothing to sneeze at. We seem to have the Bolts number no matter how stacked their team is.
wildhockey,fh7agkx,t3_f0w2t0,1581321851.0,It's funny to see some memes here and there but when I see people rooting for players to play poorly so we will get a top pick is sickening.
wildhockey,fh7aecb,t1_fh6saj8,1581321768.0,"It's a lot more than poor goaltending that is hampering this team. Our defense which the Wild have made their name in is almost non existent. Our PK is 30 and even with a average goalie I don't see it being higher than 25ish.

As much as I'd like a top pick, I'm not going to root for our players to intentionally lose."
wildhockey,fh7a7j3,t1_fh6wxw1,1581321515.0,Love to see him call Hart a bitch in Philly.
wildhockey,fh79zw7,t1_fh6npok,1581321231.0,Wins for goalies is about as reliable as wins for a pitcher. Would you still want KK up if he were 25-0 with a 3.9GAA 878Sv? It's a moot point anyway as other than a buyout (won't save much and Rask is a bigger fish) you can't get him off the team.
todayilearned,fh6h7qa,t1_fh5tyrq,1581298901.0,"Except that there have been multiple reports of soldiers wanting a larger round to put down insurgents faster. Everything you said is true, but those aren't the only ones. And I don't know why you are bringing up the Korean war.

You don't even have to go all the way up to a 7.62mm either. They have tested the 5.7mm in M16s with converted receivers that increase range and stopping power while minimal change in weight."
wildhockey,fh5kjgz,t3_f1gje6,1581289884.0,"It's sad. He was part of the don't ask don't tell generation of athletes when it came to any head trauma. Doesn't excuse what he did, but knowing what one of the factors that may have caused him to behave this way should give those close to him some POM."
todayilearned,fh5jxxx,t1_fh4pwaq,1581289689.0,It's why US soldiers in the ME have asked for more powerful rifle round. When you're up against a drugged up baddie 5.56mm round makes it seem like using a BB gun to take down a horse.
gaming,fh5f5f4,t3_f19cbz,1581288390.0,Nice room even if you're a Blues fan.
AskReddit,fh5dfgd,t3_f1avnb,1581287829.0,Snacks and drinks from gas stations. My job requires quite a bit of driving and one of the easiest place to stop for a restroom break is at a gas station. Most of the time the crew I'm with will buy their lunch/snacks at a jacked up price instead of going to the grocery store and getting multiples for cheaper.
minnesotatwins,fh5csis,t1_fh5caj2,1581287600.0,I'm not a Vikings fan (sad Charger noises) but at least you guys have Eichel. We're hedging our bets that Kaprizov becomes our super star.

minnesotatwins,fh5by2k,t1_fh5bm3z,1581287336.0,"Woah now, let's not get to crazy here. I feel for Sabres fans (IT WAS IN THE BLUE!) but having any feelings but hate for our Central brethren is heresy."
minnesotatwins,fh5ae5l,t1_fh5276q,1581286787.0,Dodgers are one of the NL teams I'm ok with. Kershaw is still a beast and we share a common history of having great catchers (Mauer/Piazza). I also dislike the Giants.
wildhockey,fh59e11,t1_fh515el,1581286482.0,"We've seen Mayhew a handful of times this year and while he wasn't horrible, he wasn't good either. The issue with guys who are great scorers in the A is they really need top 6 slots. And unless your team is riddled with injuries, that almost never happens for a multitude of reasons.

If we lose 4-6 in a row I'm all for giving a guy like Anas time with the big club. At the very least giving him 15-18 games with a NHL paycheck is something I think he's due."
Showerthoughts,fh587k4,t1_fh2yuol,1581286057.0,"But they're paid the same when they are employed though. Just like with school projects, if you get stuck with a lazy bum you do everything you can to not work with them again."
