DayofInfamy,ff02d10,t3_eqn3ov,1579464466.0,"If you play coop on Flakturm as the germans, you can run in the beginning of the match and shut the doors all around the bottom of the tower itself. The AI then can't figure out how to get in, so you have control. You then use whatever rifle you want to level (get one off an american if you need) and you can control the flow of enemies through the door and get loads of headshots. If it gets to be too many, just have someone shut the door again and reload. Be careful though, the enemies can shoot through the doors when they are shut so don't stand too near them."

I remember it was picked up as a mod and then turned into a developed game, but they stopped updating it at some point and just left it. I saw in a documentary they considering polishing it up to the standard of Insurgency, but I haven't heard anything since. The players left I guess because of lack of updates, a broken leveling system, and a lot of bugs. I kept playing the game because the core gameplay is excellent and killing Nazi bots with some friends is a fucking blast."
