There are certainly spaces that want a 10 year and its a binary thing.  They commonly actually do not deal with start up businesses and tia too.

Id you wanted one of those a good broker would explain that to you and ask you to decide if that was a deal breaker or not.  ""Well yay I get paid twice as much "" isnt great feedback to a client asking for advice on terms they dont prefer.

CommercialRealEstate,fdl82eb,t1_fdkyjry,1578518628.0,"I wanted to expand on this a bit because its actually a really really good question (Its one I frequently get, or hear unsolicited opinions on which lets me quickly figure out who are serious/experienced investors and who are not).  

For some of the other methods mentioned here:

Comparables: I mean if you can find a good set of comps that are very similar with the same expense profiles, similar occupancy, locations, quality etc I'd certainly look at that.  I'd certainly look at stable $/SF for my stable valuation too and make sure it confirms my cap rate analysis.  The odds of you doing a comparative analysis on a distressed strip center to any degree of accuracy are pretty low though.  Use that type of thing as a confirmation of your fiscal analysis.  If you did manage to find a lot of good 60% occupied strip comps maybe that says something about the market vacancy you want to consider.  One large problem you run into with retail vacancy comps too is they shift from investment buyers to owner user buyers.  Owner/users typically pay more as they remove uncertainty and vacancy concerns and have other business objectives outside of RE.

Replacement cost:  This might kinda work if its a brand new center.  Event then though there are so many things that go into this.  For replacement cost to make any sense you basically have to be in a situation where there is market demand to build a similar property, land available, and investor demand.  In that situation, you also are going to have to adjust for your property being existing for being built in the future.  On the flip side there are tons of structures out there you'd never rebuild if required, and they still have value of course, it is just less than the reconstruction value.  I'd not really worry about this at all outside of some very limited circumstances, which there are no reasons to believe exists here.

IRR/DCF: you would do this if this were larger.  I'm assuming this is a small neighborhood type strip with 5 spaces.  In that type of property you typically introduce more garbage than anything when you DCF it out.  If the 5 spaces are a 300 SF grocery, and 4 50-150k SF big boxes then yes I would do a DCF on this along with a ton of what if analysis to figure out my stress points and what can happen here that makes this a huge win or an utter disaster and assess my risk as needed.

Most beginning investors see every rule of thumb they have break on these and jump to ""well I'm not paying for potential, I only pay for in place income!"".  That is a huge mistake.  It just means you will be wasting your time and submitting an offer below what the more seasoned investors submit who know how to accurately assess this.  Likewise, if you look at this as a stable property you will over pay.  I'll discuss all day long about leasing time and other assumptions buyers are using here to do their valuations, if it comes down to ""its 60% occupied so I'm going to pay 60% of its stable value"" you are wasting your time along with the sellers/brokers/etc.

Also depending on more details distressed properties typically do not get as good of financing terms as stable ones, and there is more risk there, so compensate for that.  

One method I have seen but its fairly rare, is doing a split cap analysis too where you cap the in place income at a lower rate to essentially set a safe mark.  That is typically done as a verification method though and a kinda backstop worse case scenerio.  How that basically works is say the center should be a 7.5 cap stable but its 60% occupied as you say and the market occupancy is say 85%.  you may consider holding at 60% to be very low risk, lower risk than market risk on a fully occupied center.  You may use 5% on the in place.  That kind of analysis isn't very common though and as I said I wouldn't use that as a primary valuation, more a what if/risk assessment type valuation."

I had to do this too a long while ago.  If you dont need the money put it on fb/craigslist/eBay and be glad to get 25% of retail.  If you do go hit a few pawn shops to make sure you dont get ripped off, but they will provably all offer within a percent or two of each other and pay like 10% of retail.

Yeah you can ""try"" to pin that on someone and then shrug and say they got in trouble so no punishment is needed to share holders.  They will just hire new people and repeat.

It is hard to pin corporate criminality on individuals typically.

wcpo must of hired the enquirer's editor.

In all seriousness though what a load of crap.  Wonder how much they made off of this. 

""my corrupt company I make a lot of money with employees a lot of people so go easy on me"".  Fuck right off with that"

Billy Joel generally doesnt even tour because he can just sell out madison square gardens over and over again.  People bitch about Burberry costs and that is an entire festival.  If any of those bands had a big enough following theyd play Paul Brown instead.  When they pile up fans for 30 years and have a large amount willing to drop 400 or 500 to see their concert that is exactly what they will do I imagine."

cincinnati,fdh9u2j,t1_fdgryzm,1578418491.0,"last time i reupped with cb spectrum was actually cheaper.  It was like $3 a month and I didn't feel like changing over that, but price wise they are basically the same.  

When they installed it our tech was awesome, and gave us his cell number in case we had any issues since in his words ""if you call cb it will take forever to get anything resolved, I'm working on fiber installs all week within a few blocks of here and can stop in"".

I kinda think we all have this nostalgic vision of what cb was in the 90's and early 00's as a home town company that is just no longer true."
