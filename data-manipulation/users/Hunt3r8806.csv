FDR locked American citizens in concentration camps because of their ethnicity, Clinton openly committed perjury, Bush pushed into the Iraq invasion which was a joke, I'm sure I could name a dozen others with a bit of googling, but off the top of my head pressuring a government to investigate someone you don't like is fairly minor compared to the actions of past presidents."

Walk in with whatever amount of cash you're willing to lose, and leave the atm card at home. Not much different for me than going to a bar. I have a few drinks and play cards instead of have a few drinks sitting at a table or playing darts/pool."

offmychest,fekg5ko,t3_epn6wk,1579199348.0,"A lot of meds take time to build up and become effective.  If it's something more fast-acting, this is obviously not the case, but most anti-depressants, etc. take a while, maybe a few weeks. If you're on something like that, give it time and stick with it like clockwork. Skipping doses or going on and off can have some nasty effects. If they aren't working, talk to your doctor. There are so many options it can be hard to find the right med and dose sometimes, just stick with it until you find what works for you.

For anxiety/panic attacks, take quick-acting meds sooner rather than later. It works a lot like pain control (for me at least), and waiting until it gets really bad makes it a lot harder to bring back down. 

If you don't click with your therapist after a couple sessions, or something doesn't feel right, say so. If they are decent at all, they will have a lot of others they can refer you to. If you aren't comfortable with them you aren't going to get much out of it. If you are more comfortable with a man, or woman, or minority, just say so. They won't take it personally. They are there to help you. When in therapy, actively participate. They can't do it for you, and can only help as much as you are willing to let them. Therapy takes time, so don't judge your progress based on a couple sessions.

If you are having bad days, reach out to someone. Whether it's on Reddit, friends, family, doesn't matter. Just don't try to take on the mountain alone when you don't have to."

offmychest,feiek58,t3_epbghr,1579136679.0,"This is 100% theoretical on my part as I am not a psychiatrist or otherwise qualified, but I imagine a lot of it is projection and self-validation. Most of these guys probably were or still are bullied or the butt of jokes. Feeling like you're in a position of power, assuming workers can't actually do anything, makes it easy to flex without any actual risk. I've been around a lot of veterans/military personnel, and generally the guy bragging and flexing and trying to act like a badass warrior actually works in supply or admin.

Fuck anyone that says otherwise. Yes, he has a disability and that affects his behavior. That isn't his fault. It also isn't your fault, and you are not required to subject yourself to physical abuse, family or no. I hope your brother improves, and I would encourage you to try to be understanding with your parents. It isn't easy for them, either.

Unless there are major operational changes to the company, I don't see myself buying another EA game. Mistakes are understandable, even expected. When mistakes are either ""fixed"" with worse gameplay, or just outright ignored and mocked, it's just unacceptable and I refuse to enable it by throwing them money. There are too many games and devs to reward the cash-grabbing, arrogant shitshow that is EA/Dice. I'd rather send $60 to a dev that is trying to put out games that have passion behind them, and value their customers."

AskReddit,fef67sg,t1_fef2lyn,1579049143.0,"That's interesting, I had basically the opposite perspective. I would consider the movie Avatar art. I would consider Beethoven's symphonies art.

Loads of movies, songs, etc. have made huge amounts of money and I absolutely think they are art. 

The Witcher 3 made a bazillion dollars. It's based on literature. If the game isn't art, wouldn't that mean the books aren't art?"

MurderedByWords,feekocp,t1_fe3juu9,1579035691.0,"Thanks for the perspective. Wouldn't armor make a difference, though? I would think a rapier would be basically nullified by metal armor, and I also wouldn't think a slower, more heavily armed opponent would try to fence, just rush them and hack away. There's also the ""life at stake"" vs ""might lose a match"", and nerves can shatter you really fast. It would be an interesting thing to see, either way."

If that's the case, a fencer would probably not beat a trained (and presumably experienced)  soldier (using a broadsword) in a straight fight to the death 99% of the time.

I was in a similar situation with an ex-gf, and I came to the realization that it really didn't matter to me at all if our future kids were baptized. Being an atheist, its sprinkling some water on their head. It doesn't force them to believe anything. I was fine with the idea of our kids going to church and learning about what their mom believed, as long as she was okay with me being honest with them about what I believed (or didn't in my case).  The simple fact is that you are going to have to make decisions for your kids while they are young. That doesn't negate their free will to chose when they are old enough. Being baptized doesn't brand you into mandatory membership for life."

While the risk is very minimal, there are still risks with any kind of injection/vaccine/medication.  I'm guessing all these people telling you you are the asshole would be the first to scream ""my body my choice' about anything else.  Your friend is within her rights to require anyone around the kids have a flu shot. That is her choice. It was also her choice to have kids, so if her requirements limit who is available to help, that's on her, not you. Make the healthcare choice that you think is best for YOU, not someone else."

Either ESH or NTA. Yes, cancer is serious, even more survivable types.  That said, dealing with a health issue for a few months doesn't mean you need to remind everyone about it 24/7 for years to come. Being proud or supportive of others is fine, and great to do.  Making someone else's health problem into story hour about yourself is not fine. There's a time and place.

I would also add that you should have handled it a bit more tactfully either way.
