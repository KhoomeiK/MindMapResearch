Phoebe is now only reserved for when she’s in big troubles"

TellMeAFact,ff4x4kl,t1_ff2pfrb,1579574552.0,"First off you don’t know me. Im a queer who was raised by a single parent, im the last person you need to tell those kind of parentships can be successful. And that still has absolutely nothing to do with your point. Arranged marriages are neither same sex, nor single parents. Once again that goes against your argument, because most cultures that have arranged marriage, don’t support gay relationships. 

Divorce rate isn’t a good measure because there are all sorts of reasons and pressures for people to stay in unhappy marriages. The divorce rate was also lower in America in the 1950s. Do you think people were happier back then? No, wives were getting beat by their husbands and unable to divorce because that would hurt their “social status”.

There is LITERALLY a comment above that references an article that states these attributes as things that are often put in newspapers adverts to show off their brides. So no I’m not xenophobic, also I happen to be poc!

I actually don’t feel any type of way about people laughing at American marriage statistics. I think it’s abysmal, and we have a lot of idiots getting married for the wrong reasons. I’m also not laughing at arranged marriage cultures, I think it’s sad not funny. It’s sad that your family could force you to spend the rest of your life with somebody terrible, or who isn’t even in line with your sexual orientation"
TellMeAFact,ff27k3y,t1_ff21oxb,1579496078.0,"I didn’t say us marriages are something to aspire to, I never said we do marriage and family correctly. Also I don’t understand the point in stating that you can have kids alone or with same sex couples, that has nothing to do with this... but that’s actually an argument against arranged marriages. That gay people are being forced into straight relationships, because I get a feeling that most arranged marriage cultures don’t give their children that option 

Again their divorce rate isn’t an accurate indicator of anything, people sometimes stay in very unhappy marriages. There’s obviously anecdotal evidence on both sides that show arranged marriages can be good or bad. But it just makes more sense to spend time with the person you’re gonna raise a child with before committing to that. If I date someone and he has a crazy temper and gets mad easily, I’m gonna break up with him. But if I get forced into a marriage with him, I’m stuck with a potentially abusive partner.

All around I don’t know how you can argue against the right to choose who you spend the rest of your life with. That’s a huge thing that someone else shouldn’t be deciding for you based on that persons skin tone, or how many cows their family has"
TellMeAFact,ff1zqwx,t1_ff05zzr,1579490000.0,"That doesn’t make it any better. I don’t really care what label you want to put on it. If you’re gonna commit to a lifelong partnership and raise children together, it needs to be with the right person. It’s great that it sometimes works out, but this is also leaving a lot of room for toxicity in a relationship and family unit of you have no idea who the person is that you’re committing to"
