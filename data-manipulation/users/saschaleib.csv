Finland,ffhley7,t3_etfbsl,1579940797.0,"Er, I don't know what a ""microwave kiln"" is, but tinkering with a 2 kW microwave emitter is not for the faint-hearted, and anything that radiates with this power and isn't properly shielded (as a microwave-oven is), can have pretty bad side-effects, from disrupting the Internet for the entire neighbourhood to boiling your blood.

Also, if this interfers with local communication lines (which is likely if the shielding isn't up to the standards), you are likely to receive a hefty fine from the supervisory authority.

So before you start with any microwave projects, better check with the authorities what you can and what you can't do. The frequency bands are highly regulated and things are under close supervision. In extreme cases (and a 2 kW emitter is definitely an extreme case) it might even end up at the public prosecution…"
Finland,ffg16a7,t1_fffw1s5,1579896222.0,I feel with you – and it must even add insult to injury when you learned that university education is free in Finland – even for foreign students and even for programmes taught in English… ;-)

Finland,ffei0lt,t1_ffdgkso,1579848803.0,"Prices for cottages differ greatly, depending on the size, state, location of the property. It can go from the equivalent of a garden shed all the way to a price level where you could also get a castle at the Loire in France (well, almost ;-)

You can get an overview if you look at the usual websites, like tori.fi, etuovi.com or asunnot.oikotie.fi – look for ""mökit"" (cottages) or ""loma-asunnot"" (holiday houses), and you want to ""myydään"" (buy). This should give you an overview over the market. Basically: further north is cheaper, closer to Helsinki is more expensive.

Locations near mountains are hard to find in Finland, though, as there are hardly any elevations that could possibly qualify as ""mountain"". There are lots of lakes, though, and your own lake- or sea-shore is quasi a ""must-have"" for any 'mökki'.

Finland has recently put some restrictions on buying property, and as a non-EU citizen you would need get permission from some ministry (don't remember which, but should be easy to find out). Regularly that should be no problem, though, unless you are a known mafia boss or a Russiann oligarch.

On the countryside here in Finland, most of the roads (basically all except the main roads) are dirt paths, but they are maintained really excellently by the municipalities, and when I was snowed in here in December (testing the cottage in winter before buying ;-) they came to dig me out after a day or so, which was more than OK, considering that this is really very remote and there are thousands of kilometers of minor roads all around here...

The biggest challenge we had here, though, was that Finnish banks are very reluctant to give out bank accounts – even to EU citizens. Yes, that is in direct violation of some EU directive, but it is troublesome nevertheless. In our case, only the third bank we went to was willing to help. 

Once this was done, and we managed to transfer the money to our Finnish account, we had a meeting with the sellers, the agent and the notary at the bank and got everything done and dusted within 20 minutes. 

If you have questions, please feel free to ask... :-)"

Finland,ffegyz7,t1_ffdb30h,1579847615.0,"Järviradio plays Suomi-Pop 24/7. I mean … big fan of Finrock and can do with the occasional Finn-Heavy-Metal, but Suomi-Pop … nah!
But, yes, we have one (electric) sauna in the house and a wood-heated one in the sauna cottage near the lake. Yesterday it was the house-sauna, but tonight I'm planning to fire up the lakeside-sauna... yeah!

We are thinking of letting the place for a couple of weeks when we're not using it, but only after a few renovations and improvements (so probably not this year). Keep an eye on AirBnB ;-)"

Finland,ffefplp,t1_ffdgj3k,1579846250.0,Wood stove is indeed the #1 thing we’re missing here. We have a builder coming in in a couple of days to check if one could be installed...
Finland,ffd9g1y,t1_ffd537x,1579816029.0,"Land alone - like forest just after the trees have been harvested - is incredible cheap. In the area here it would be around € 0.20/m^2. The reason is that of course nobody wants to buy this.
If there are trees on the land - especially old trees it’s quickly 5 times that price or more.
If you want land with building rights, even at a lakeside maybe, it’s actually quite expensive. If it is connected to the electricity grid on top of that, it is not far from what you pay for building land in city centres..."
Finland,ffd8sfi,t1_ffd6f5q,1579815655.0,"There’s about 10 ha of pristine Finnish forest (read: loads of pines!) on the other side of the camera. The cottage is quite comfortable, with good electric heating 2 bedrooms and all in good state - and we also have a sauna at the lakeside - even  building rights for two more cottages along the shore is in … so, no, it wasn’t cheap, even though the nearest supermarket is 30 km and the nearest bus stop (2 busses per day) still 17 km away.
At least the Internet (via mobile) is fast and stable. Unless the power is out, like it was just before Christmas, but that’s (hopefully) exceptional. :-)"
Finland,ffd7zku,t1_ffd611w,1579815193.0,"Haha, we are actually thinking about letting it via AirBnB at least a few weeks per year … but we first have to make a few renovations … well, and of course it is first of all a place for us. But watch out for it ;-)"

Finland,ffcy4o7,t1_ffcxu9u,1579809674.0,Nope. It helps to be EU citizen though… but I understand that the Russians are also buying a lot.
Finland,ffcwlzo,t3_esxqmb,1579808793.0,"A bit of background information: me and my wife were both exchange students at the University of Tampere when we met. Even though we later moved away from Finland, we are still very much attached to the country and usually rented a mökki for summer holidays.

Last summer we thought we looked at a few mökkis to buy, but none was nearly as nice as the one we usually rent. So we contacted the owner, like: ""just in case you would ever think about selling…"" well, he would, and after a bit of haggling and discussion, we finally bought the place.

Today we fley in to sign the deed, and you can not believe how good it feels to sit here in our very own cottage.

And yes, as a teenager I indeed dreamed of living in the forest somewhere in the US or Canada. Well, nothing against Canada, but this here is definitely better ;-) even though I won't be able to live here full-time just yet..."

Finland,ff31fbn,t3_ercaku,1579531127.0,"Bed bugs are rather uncommon in Finland, and they don't like it cold: leaving your matrace outside (under a roof!) over night at -20°C or below in dry weather, will reliably kill them.

As this will also kill dust mites (which are harmless, but can cause allergic reactions), it is a good idea to use the cold winter weather to do this in any case.

Edit: I've just learned that bed bugs also don't like heat; at mere 46°C they will die within minutes. If only we had a room in the house that was easy to heat up to such a high temperature... Hmmmm... ;-)"
