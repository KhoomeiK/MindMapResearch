witcher,fff9j5a,t1_fff8leh,1579879039.0,It's the story of choosing the lesser evil. She forced him to fight him. He didn't want to.
Advice,fff9fd5,t1_fff85gt,1579878972.0,OP never mentioned it was a co-worker.
Advice,fff9dm6,t3_etbgm9,1579878940.0,Just distance yourself from him. I have had this kind of experience. While a little flirting is harmless. But left unchecked it can cause repercussions you are not ready for. Try taking yourself out of the picture when he is concerned to get over him. I have had this experience before. Now I don't flirt with the guy and he now looks at me like he is wondering what is going on with me. So he either noticed it and/or missed that kind of interaction. He also has a gf. But we hardly ever see her. I feel bad but I just needed to get over him. I had to stop hanging out to do that.

witcher,fff8afw,t1_fff7yff,1579878205.0,Well of course not. But that is not the point. Gerald just didn't want her to be mutilated even though she was dead. A kind of being disrespectful to the dead.
Advice,fff86rs,t3_etaxm4,1579878133.0,Talk to your parents about it and ask if they can talk to the neighbor. It sounds unusual but it could have a rational explanation. Record it and play that for your parents.
rant,fff6nid,t3_etb7se,1579877062.0,Everybody has the annoying co-worker. I have one that blows his nose very loudly. We are in an open office network so I think that just makes it worse. Most people use headphones or earbuds in our office to block out the noise of co-workers around us.
witcher,fff6e0g,t1_ffeujjr,1579876871.0,I don't think that was the point of it. I think Gerald didn't want him to touch her because enough was enough with the killings and he was dealing with his own internal turmoil because he had to fight her.
witcher,ffefajm,t1_ff3jizh,1579845813.0,And why did he want to do an autopsy? Because she was a mutant and he wanted to see if he could discover anything that could stop the rest of the Black Sun births.

I have tried it, but I get a dialogue box pop up saying that ""We noticed you are on a Mac based system, and will need to connect to the Citrix Reciever. I have it installed, but it's still defeats the idea of using the web-browser based system if I have to connect to the receiver anyways. it is the way the different OS systems have to interact I guess."

witcher,ffeeejl,t1_ffayf0s,1579844910.0,"Also, in the book Geralt and Stregobor talk about evil and the lesser evil, and which to choose. Geralt didn't want any part of what Stregobor wanted, to kill Renfri, and visa versa with Renfri killing Stregobor. He just happened to be there at the time."
witcher,ffee55z,t1_ffcomrm,1579844652.0,"Yeah they changed it a bit. I lost the traction when I saw that part too. Geralt wasn't taking sides, he wanted to stay out of it, but he didn't want to have to fight Renfri."
witcher,ffee3dk,t1_ffcngyv,1579844604.0,"Yes, Renfri was enacting the ultimatum from that event. Geralt finally figured it out but it was too late. She had already gone to the tower."
witcher,ffee0h7,t1_ffcen9s,1579844525.0,"So in the book market day referred to when Renfri and her gang would enact a way to force the Mage out of his tower to save the town and she would have her revenge and kill him. But, it was a ruse, as he went to the tower while Geralt went to the market but got in a fight instead."

witcher,ff8bwh3,t1_ff4lju6,1579672291.0,Or perhaps to feel love. Being a Witcher he really has no emotions. Yen used a love potion of some sort in which he succomed to. Perhaps he wants to feel what is really love.
witcher,ff8bfsq,t3_erq4bb,1579671824.0,Was this what Geralt really wanted to get the djinn for? To get some sleep? He was shouting at Jaskier because he wanted some sleep.
offmychest,ff7t1pt,t3_erka9x,1579657665.0,"Why not just talk to your husband when he says something about your talking with other guys. If you are not flirting an behaving you're not doing anything wrong. He may be jealous, but should just relax if you are talking with friends."

Also, perhaps they heard you have a family friend who works there and they think you got the job because of her. You can buck it and work you best to show the you are a good employee. But if it makes you feel like crap by the end of the day find another job. No job is worth working with a bunch of bitches."
relationships,ff4h4m3,t3_eribsb,1579563478.0,That's too bad this happened. Message him and tell him you miss his friendship and that you realize he met new people and if there is still room for you in there. If he continues to be like that then move on. It's tough and it sucks but unfortunately some people forget the value of friendship when they meet new people.
relationships,ff4gxpc,t3_erila6,1579563347.0,Well they say you really don't know someone until you live with them. Talk to him and say that his lack of cleanliness is a real turn-off. Perhaps he needs a cleaning lady to come in once a week. You can also split up the chores and switch off.
relationships,ff4grpv,t3_erisrs,1579563233.0,You and your wife need to talk about this and be on the same page. Of course it's hard for her to break it off with this guy. But for her mother to not let her in is going too far.She is being irrational. Then she should ask herself did she ever date someone her parents didn't like? What happened?  Even if she does move out where will she go? It will go even deeper and she will grow to resent you both. And she will continue to see this guy and who knows what will happen. Of course her mother is not happy she is with this guy but her mother needs to help her see things differently. Try and talk not only to your wife but with your daughter. She needs to be reminded she is only 16 and has no real experience with boys to see what will happen. It will not be all hearts and flowers. She will move on from him after she sees how he messes up.  It won't last. Wait a month and see what happens. She needs to know you both care.

You could complain to management about her behavior not being professional with the crying but they may think she needs help. Maybe she does need professional help.  She thinks that crying will gain sympathy from staff, and then they will not do anything. They will get tired of her crying and will stop engaging her. If she keeps it up and if anyone complains to management about her lack of professionalism, she will either get a warning first or fired. Ignore her behavior and give it time."
Advice,fejy7h3,t3_epjr3l,1579188550.0,Your roommate is wrong to tell you things like you shouldn't be studying and waste time cooking. Tell him that while you appreciate his company but to what he wants for you and what you want for yourself are different. You can express to him you value his friendship. Also tell him to stop waking you up. That is over the line.

Advice,fejw1mm,t3_epja0t,1579187161.0,You know what? She sounds like an entitled bitch who is manipulating you and a parasite. That is not a friend.  She is trying to make you feel bad? Forget her. You will never get the money back she got from you. She is just angry that you won't be giving her money anymore. It's too bad a friend turned out to be so needy but for your friend to say those hurtful things to you sounds like the last straw. And bringing up that thing about you and your mom is way over the line. You can cut her off and ignore her and tell her that now that she has hurt your feelings you definitely will not be giving her any more money or your time. You do not owe her a darn thing.
Advice,fejvio6,t1_fejpetf,1579186814.0,He shouldn't have to sit down with his boss and tell him anything about this guy. It could turn out to be nothing. OP didn't mention anything about a secret he is keeping from his job an that he has a clean record. This could all blow over and the soon to be divorced brother-in-law will calm down. His just angry about the divorce and lashing out.
Advice,fejvcuu,t3_epjdej,1579186710.0,"Does this brother-in-law have some kind of secret(s) to tell your employers? I would talk to your sister and tell her your concerns that he is over-stepping. Since when do you have anything to do with their divorce anyways? He is just angry that they are getting a divorce and l lashing out at you. How was your relationship with him before the divorce? If you had something on a good level, perhaps text him and say that while you are sorry about the divorce and losing him as a brother-in-law, you would appreciate it if he would keep your job business out of his business. Hopefully he will calm down. Perhaps he needs counseling."
Advice,fejuzn0,t1_fejnrg9,1579186465.0,I think that sends the wrong message if he says they are getting married. He needs to stand up to his gf and say that he is not leaving his friends just for the sake of his girlfriend's insecurity with one girl. He doesn't need counseling. He just needs to stand up to his girlfriend and also let this female friend know that texting outside of work and to dial back on the flirtiness.
Advice,fejut00,t1_fejng9a,1579186345.0,"You're giving him the wrong vibe I think. His gf is insecure and jealous. He shouldn't have to leave her, but I do agree he needs to stand up to her and tell her that he isn't leaving the friend group just because of one person. If he does this he will have more respect for himself. He is not desparate. He could probably find any girl he wants. You don't know him that well."
Advice,feju2pt,t1_fejp821,1579185864.0,That can cause problems later when the gf feels that he is trying to separate them because she feels he is trying to hide something. His girlfriend seems insecure and jealous.
Advice,fejtxfr,t3_epj6lw,1579185767.0,"I don't think it's right of your gf to ask you to stop seeing these friends just for one person. You can tell your gf that is isn't fair to stop seeing these friends because of her. Your gf seems to be kind of insecure. If you tell her that you are just friends and that there is nothing going on but will talk to the female friend about it and that you will distance yourself. I also think the texting could have something to do with it. Perhaps stop texting her and visa versa. I know that there are guys who have female friends that text each other, but when the gf enters the picture and sees that it can cause issues with trust if the gf is insecure. I do have some guy friends that I text with that my man knows, but I don't make a big deal of it and not always texting them every day. My man knows it isn't anything more than friendship. He knows them and is fine with it.

Don't let your gf rule your social life. She needs to trust you. Ask her if she trusts you. If she does then tell her that there should be no problem. If she is jealous, tell her there is nothing to worry about. She needs reassurance.

Perhaps you can talk to this one female friend and nicely say that your gf is jealous that she is kind of flirty and while you appreciate her friendship nothing else will ever happen and that she needs to dial it back a bit. If the female friend is getting too friendly tell her you are not interested that way and that you are not comfortable with it. Tell her you value her friendship and hope she understands. She may like you but you have to make her understand. Try and have your gf around her more and make her realize it."
Advice,fejt2zv,t3_epi69z,1579185177.0,"I would talk to campus police and security and the people who work in student welfare to make them aware of this guy. Take a picture of him and show it to them. Also post up flyers with his face on it with bold text saying this guy is a stalker and to watch out for him, and to call police if found. Try and go places with a friend for your own security. He is stalking you and this could take a serious turn if he is not dealt with. Do you have pepper spray? If not gets some! Amazon delivers quick. If he gets too close and tries to touch you spray him with it!"

Does he have insomnia or sleep apnea and not getting enough sleep thus making it hard to get out of bed in the morning? Have a talk with him about what causes him to be late. Tell him this issue about not taking the dogs out has fallen on to you since he isn't doing it, and you work evenings so it isn't considerate of him to just let them stay in and assume you will do it. They are his responsibility. If he cannot make an effort, tell him to get a dog walker. Or better yet, just hire one and tell him he is paying for it. He will then have to make the effort to get up and walk the dogs. 

At this point you are not a team. He is assuming you will clean up after him. If he can't help out anymore than it's time to move on. He doesn't need a girlfriend, he needs a cleaning lady and a dog walker."
