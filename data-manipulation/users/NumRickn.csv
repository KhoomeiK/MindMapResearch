ColorBlind,fc9iiap,t1_fc8ffjq,1577553170.0,"I agree and disagree. I think they support the clickbaity aspects of 'seeing color for the first time' on their website. I get that it generates buzz but it also leads to disappointment in alot of users who were so optimistic about the effects.

I agree with you about the glasses themselves though, they do filter to add vibrancy and it has absolutely helped me better distinguish the color red. It took me days of wearing them to notice an effect but now I'm better at telling the difference between blue and purple since I can notice the red a bit more. Same with forests and fields, on a sunny day the world just seems more colorful with them.

The aren't a cure all by any means, many people have a type of colorblindness that they don't address and even those of the right type can be so severe that they won't help anyway.

 I'm sorry for OPs experience though, they definitely should not be bought as gifts, and those reaction videos are doing a massive disservice to people with colorblindness. 

All that being said, I kept mine since i rarely buy sunglasses and they are an objectively nice pair, but I dont really feel they are worth the price for what they claim to do. I advise people to wait until an affordable alternative hits the market. Or buy them just to try and then return them. But definitely temper your expectations of what they do, it's not at all a miraculous experience"
