worldnews,ffklhzb,t1_ffkaz9u,1580024739.0,"Yeah I was in high school during Dubya's Presidency.

I still think there has been no better example of how American conservatives vote party over policy than the Patriot Act.

When that bill made its way to congress, progressives across America denounced it for allowing the government to engage in illegal wiretaps and the unconstitutional surveillance of American citizens. Without fail, conservatives would respond, ""The government would never do that, this is just a bill to fight terrorism, America's intelligence agencies would never violate the fourth amendment by illegally spying on citizens. Anyone who doesn't support the Patriot Act is anti-American!""

Then Edward Snowden revealed that our intelligence agencies were engaged in *every* single abuse of power we warned conservatives about.

But, since Obama was president when Snowden blew the whistle, conservatives were absolutely livid that a law like the Patriot Act could even exist. These are the same motherfuckers who said, ""If you don't support the Patriot Act you're anti-American,"" and, ""If Democrats don't vote to pass the Patriot Act, the terrorists will win.""

But instead of facing the consequences of the unconstitutional law they supported, they engaged in a mass delusion in which the Patriot Act was created and passed by Obama. In five years, they went from, ""Republicans are writing this law therefore it must be good,"" to, ""This law is bad, therefore it must have been written by Democrats.""

The Patriot Act didn't change. They only thing that changed was the party in power and yet, suddenly, conservatives thought the Patriot Act was evil. Because American conservatives don't care about policy, they only care about party: If Republicans support it, it's moral and if Democrats support it, it's immoral. Even if the law itself is exactly the same.

It's also a great illustration of how conservatives are able to see Donald Trump - a demonstrably immoral, criminal scumbag - as a beacon of morality."

For instance: Donald Trump didn't start any billion dollar companies. Every company he's started has ended up bankrupt. He once had a business partner sue him to force him to stay away from the company they owned together because the choices he made had nearly bankrupt the organization. He's such a terrible business person he once bankrupt a *casino.* That's a special tier of incompetence, especially when you realize that all the other casinos in Atlantic City were making money hand over fist while Trump ran his into the ground. So, Trump not only ran the least successful casino in Atlantic City, his casino was the only that lost money. Not only did it lose money, it went bankrupt.

Hilariously, had Donald Trump simply invested the multi-million inheritance his dad gave him into a mutual fund, he would be worth a lot more money today than he is. That's how bad a businessman Donald Trump is; he's an abject failure who literally would've made more money had he never started a business. That's a staggering level of ineptitude.

But most importantly, that call took place only a few weeks before Trump's run. At that point, Trump had already been laying the foundation for a run: He had pushed his way into a speaking gig at CPAC and had been networking with conservative allies to prepare the announcement *since 2013.* It was also his fourth attempt to launch a presidential campaign and the second that came to fruition.

To put that in perspective, Christiano Renaldo ran a plus-5 second forty at 6'2"" 185.

You're definitely right that, in soccer, speed and agility are far more important than strength, but Lebron would be the tallest, strongest *and* fastest dude on the pitch in nearly every hypothetical game he would play in. Also, we can probably throw out listed weights in this thought experiment - had these dudes trained for soccer instead of football, their trainers wouldn't have forcefed them 8 meals a day since bulk isn't the strategic advantage it is in football. 

Personally, if I had to pick one guy who would've dominated soccer had they not played football, I'd pick Patrick Peterson. He's 6'1"", runs a 4.34 forty, plays a position where footwork and hip flexibility are of paramount importance and boasts *world class* agility (6.5 three cone drill).

Tyreek Hill is another fun one to imagine. Dude runs a 4.25 (!!!) 40 and looks even faster than that on the field. I mean, he makes some of the fastest human beings on earth look slow every single week."

todayilearned,ff80nk2,t1_ff7yypy,1579662916.0,"Lmao, so your story is ""there are no bad prosecutors in America""?

Fucking lol

Also, the fuck do defense attorneys have to do with anything? Defense attorneys don't *wield the power of the state to kill and imprison.*

Probably not a lot of defense attorneys with photos of dead men - almost half eventually exonerated - taped to electric chair trophies. That's kind of a DA thing."

todayilearned,ff7rqes,t1_ff7owss,1579656756.0,"Definitely.

I do think it's compounded by the nature of prosecutors' duties. That is to say, prosecutors aren't interested in the *truth,* they're interested in *getting convictions,* so I think DA offices *tend* to attract authoritarian, black-and-white thinkers who see themselves as crusaders (frequently, crusaders in Christ) against *bad people.* So we end up with a helluva lot of bloody minded, regressive assholes in DA offices. Breaking disclosure laws, hiding evidence, ignoring other evidence, etc etc. The type of people who, if they were being honest, would tell you that it doesn't matter whether the person *actually* committed the crime because he was a *bad person* who deserved to be in jail anyway."

Forget the rankings, *can you even read?*"

99% of the time they will refuse to admit the person is innocent, claim that they were right the whole time and that the dude deserves to remain in prison."
