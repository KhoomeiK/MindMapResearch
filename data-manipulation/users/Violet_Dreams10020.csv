Jackfruit gave me the worst kind of reaction though, i really could not breath when after I ate a few so I had to stop entirely which is a shame cause jackfruit is delicious."
MangaCollectors,ff6fzx8,t3_erspwd,1579626380.0,"I went to a bookstore called “Tatsuya” when I was in Hokkaido, however there should be on in Tokyo as well (I think it’s even bigger). It’s not necessarily a bookstore dedicated to manga per say, however it is a very gorgeous and the one in Hokkaido had an entire 1/3 of the floor dedicated to manga. I think they mostly had more recent/popular stuff though.

I do suggest going though! The store not only has manga but various other books and novels, music as well as a stationary section of the store! Also a Starbucks and restaurant inside. 
Being a book lover in general I practically almost cried when I went inside, it was an amazing experience on its own."

BisexualTeens,fej20py,t1_fei6a0b,1579154004.0,"Ahh I see, despite me not really advocating for it, you can pirate some manga if you really like it, and possibly buy it in the future when you have more money.

Here’s a link to a list of an endless amount yuri manga/webtoons/Chinese webcomics that you might like, there’s much more than what anime could ever have. Maybe you will enjoy some of them! You will also recognize some titles too, cause they got the anime adaptation

BisexualTeens,fegyosx,t1_fegi0k8,1579105468.0,"You might like Yagate Kimi Ni Naru. Personally I find the MC lowkey annoying but it’s the other yuri I watched. 

Here’s some others that I haven’t watched to give you some variety:

Kase-san and morning glories, 
Sasameki koto, 
Aoi Hana, 
Sakura Trick 

And some unconventional yuri:
Akuma no Riddle (I enjoyed this actually, more on assassins and mystery), 
Happy Sugar Life (if you want psychological horror, honestly this one gave me the chills)

Do you read manga or webtoons by any chance?"

HobbyDrama,fe92kpp,t3_eo3y4y,1578933480.0,"I remember this being insanely huge then, and I braced myself for it when I watched it a couple of months ago. Personally, I think it wasn’t as bad as it was being said online (iirc the worst part was censored), however I do think that there should’ve been a warning in the synopsis or something because at least people know what they will be getting themselves into."

godtiersuperpowers,fe0hs4k,t3_enbmz6,1578813636.0,"Honestly this is what I dream I could do. I have a friend who lives across the country (US) and she’s struggling all alone and I can’t do a damn thing to help her because she’s not answering my texts. I don’t know what she’s thinking, how she’s really doing and it just makes me feel so useless. If I could just teleport to her, hug her, and tell her that I’m here than that’s all I need."
BisexualTeens,fe0fjfp,t3_en4ijt,1578812559.0,"Confusing sometimes, and it can lead to questioning which is stressful but I’m slowly getting used to it. It gets interesting to see who I find attractive that day."

This makes me feel better about it though, thank you!!"

GayChristians,fdqtuk3,t3_emi8kv,1578674752.0,"Doing ok myself, I’m just very worried about my closest friend. She’s struggling and hasn’t spoken to me for two months. Usually this isn’t abnormal but she never said Merry Christmas or Happy New Year which she did every year no matter how busy she is. I’m worried that she’s suffering all alone and I can’t do anything to help. It also doesn’t help when I have feelings for her too."

Personally since I don’t really mind slow story progression I enjoyed it, but I would say it doesn’t pick up until the 20th (single) volume. That’s near the end though. 

Since you’re over halfway and bored, I think it’s a good idea to return it"
wholesomememes,fcus2hr,t1_fcu8zp1,1577987360.0,"I just turned 18 but I’m still living with my parents, and I don’t think I can leave any time soon. I used to self harm in secret but not anymore. The changes are actually small things, like deciding not to eat something I usually enjoy because I’m simply not hungry or wearing a new outfit. My parents like to turn it into a whole ordeal for some reason.

They also think therapists are useless but I do regularly go to a counselor in secret. She has helped me a lot through my anxiety, but it seems that every time I go home my family finds some kind of way to make me revert back to my original state."
bisexual,fctpjmp,t3_eilxpa,1577952960.0,"Being an anime watcher I’ve always went crazy over anime guys, but sometimes I see an anime girl and my heart just does that small leap like when I see a cute anime guy. I thought it was a normal reaction but now when I think back to when I saw Cordelia from Violet Evergarden I cannot believe I didn’t have any bisexual thoughts then. In fact, I think I had suppressed the thought that I found her that attractive. I didn’t think it was ‘right’ so internalized homophobia I guess?

It took falling in love with my straight best friend to realize I’m bi lol"
BisexualTeens,fctouj2,t3_eiff0b,1577952019.0,"I used to have the same thoughts too. But after a while it eventually boiled down to “do I like guys and girls?” And I always answer with “yes” and that’s all I need

I have days when I find myself thinking how hot guys are, then I have days where it’s girls. Some days I think everyone I see is hot. Maybe it’s hormones? Idk 

Then there are times when I scoff at real life people and squeal over anime guys and girls cause I’m a degenerate. 

Constantly questioning yourself will make you even more confused, and you don’t need to feel like you have to feel 50/50 on your attraction with guys and girls. Just feel how you want to feel, the label doesn’t have to define you, it can just be what best describes you.

GayChristians,fch2h5r,t3_eh4dss,1577646671.0,"Hello fellow Harry Potter fan! 
Since everyone has answered what your main question is, I want to focus on your mental health for a bit. I personally don’t think there’s a case where you shouldn’t have the right to be depressed. There’s a reason why many celebrities have depression despite having practically everything they ever need. 

These feelings that you have whether it’s hating yourself or being depressed, it’s ok to have them. You’re still trying to accept and love yourself, and the people closest to you, that is your family, is making you think that who you are isn’t who you should be. 

It’s a slow process, but in time, with lots of self reflection and praying to God, you will learn to accept yourself and no longer be afraid."
