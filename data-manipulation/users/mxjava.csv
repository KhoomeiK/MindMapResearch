Zig was his nickname -- his proper name was Ziggy Stardust because he had a single coat (no undercoat on the top) and it glittered like graphite on a page, like stars. He loved to play a game I called Rawr. He'd walk up to me on the desktop and sort of do a trust fall toward me, trusting me to catch him. And I would catch him in a crossed-arm cradle and lift him up while saying ""Rawr!"" It was his favorite. He'd purr so hard and wriggle all over with happiness, and he'd do it a few times. Every night, I would just be falling asleep when I'd feel him creep in and curl up in the crook of that arm.

He wasn't perfect. He caused me a few falls from getting underfoot and he'd throw temper tantrums back in the old days when he wanted to eat five times a day and I was trying to watch his weight. He tried to tear down the screens on the porch every time he got out there.

I will miss him so, so much. My little boy."
