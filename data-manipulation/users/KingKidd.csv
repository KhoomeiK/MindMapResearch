I don’t think you’ve ever been to a hair salon or barbershop. Or you just don’t understand the purpose of that subsection of FL’s non-compete law as it would apply to a small business. 
 
OP’s clients are the Salon’s business. A non-compete with a 5 mile, 1 year non-compete would protect the Salon’s business interests in keeping that hair dresser’s client list from leaving with the hair dresser. The non-compete would allow them to lose the hairdresser but keep a portion of their clientele. 
 
Many customers visit the same salon and the same hairdresser - when their hair dresser leaves, they have to decide whether or not to follow. If there’s a geographic non-compete - the choice is to stay or drive x more miles to keep the same hair dresser. 
 
You don’t have to be a CFO or negotiate million dollar contracts to have a close relationship with your employers customers. Non-competes in the salon industry are commonly enforceable in states that allow reasonable non-competes. You’re welcome to do the research yourself, but the statute 545.335-b-3 would be the basis of such a contract in FL. 

We don’t have enough information to say whether it would be enforceable in OP’s case, but your base assumption that just because OP works in a service industry/salon means it’s invalid is incorrect. It doesn’t have to be based on a trade secret - which is clear according to the Florida statute. If there’s a non-compete that the salon owner can produce, she needs an attorney to review it. If the salon owner is interfering without a non-compete, OP needs an attorney for a tortious interference claim."
