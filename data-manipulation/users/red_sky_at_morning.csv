My gynecologist is amazing and always respected and never pushed and never disregarded my concerns regarding hormonal medications (ALL forms of hormonal meds cause suicidal ideation episodes) as well as how severe my cramping pain was - she was the first doctor to take it seriously and found I have endometriosis, she brought me relief from the pain for the first time in 11 years. I was still nervous about bringing up sterilization, but when I told her I was certain I wanted my tubes tied she made zero objections. No making me feel belittled because ""I may change my mind with age"" or ""well what if your husband....""  She was the one to suggest bilateral salpingectomy for the same reasons as you had (I also have a history of ovarian cancer, it took my paternal grandma from us.)


It is so refreshing to read experiences like yours. I've read far too many of women being dismissed or belittled by their PCPs or gynecologists. So happy for you, toodle loo tubes!!!"
