gaming,ffgoj93,t1_ffev6n2,1579911089.0,"Haha Hearthstone, Slay the Spire, Smash Ultimate, but yes. Cant play FE3H because I dont have enough time to get into it... but hol' up while I play 3 hours of Slay the Spire."
NintendoSwitchDeals,ffcrn4e,t1_ffc9krs,1579805843.0,I would def prefer a wired option with no amiibo support. Maybe the Gyro and HD Rumble are pretty important for the gaming experience or at least that's what Nintendo thinks?
NintendoSwitch,ff7u40i,t1_ff7gr93,1579658404.0,I would imagine there are a good amount of games that no one has enjoyed.
NintendoSwitch,ff7t2b9,t1_ff7m4x6,1579657676.0,"Yeah every game wont be for everyone, there is no getting around that.some games, however, are for NO ONE. Tons of games are complete dogshit and those can be easily avoided by googling. It's the best option to get a good take on a game."
nintendo,ff7h3j6,t1_ff76twp,1579649403.0,"Best part about being a parent is seeing your kids happy. I hope I never lose sight of this, I've got 2 under 3."
slaythespire,ff6aqq7,t1_ff6a19n,1579623079.0,There is no way a couple of those cards is enough power to do enough damage.  Do you actually win runs regularly with shiv or are you just theorizing?
slaythespire,ff68k4t,t1_ff5v3bu,1579621668.0,"Of course those synergies help, but shiv decks, even with a lot of synergies, are typically very weak. They clog up your deck to thin out your defense, and they dont do enough damage fast enough. Poison can get away with very few poison cards and tons of defense in contrast."
gaming,ff4cj5v,t3_erch8w,1579560409.0,I spent so much time in Gauntlet Legends!
slaythespire,ff2eajs,t1_ff25hvl,1579502586.0,"Shiv decks are generally super weak. Sure you can make them work if everything lines up, but they're super risky. 0 cost cards are definitely bad options unless you have a lot of higher cost cards already, and/or a lot of draw."
slaythespire,ff2e5zk,t1_ff1nvzg,1579502443.0,"Similar things can be said about just drawing the wrong cards. Maybe you really need to draw some damage and you draw nothing but defense or vice versa. It's an RNG based card game, so you have to play with the RNG in mind to get the best results!"
todayilearned,fezllpd,t1_feykcva,1579458662.0,"Retro, service focused businesses?"
Homebrewing,feymg7k,t1_fey6zqt,1579447572.0,"Yes I know how to theoretically create more body, but at 3% or less it wont really matter what you do from a practices standpoint. You arent going to be left with much residual. Adding unfermentables and yeast selection are more important."
Homebrewing,feym6mo,t1_fewnyd6,1579447478.0,No it's not. Roast barley is unmalted.
Homebrewing,feym25s,t1_fewtv9d,1579447427.0,Who cares what you call it! If you made it and you enjoy it that's what matters:)
Homebrewing,fewma68,t1_fewl1vp,1579414453.0,Stouts have Roast Barley. Porter is basically a dark beer without Roast Barley. Usually Porters are more crystal heavy (relative to stouts) as well.
Homebrewing,fewlks5,t1_fev5wsw,1579413716.0,I don't think any grain will give you mouthfeel in such a small beer. Itll be thin because there isnt much in it. Maltodextrin or lactose would probably be your best bet.
NintendoSwitch,feuowr1,t1_feu6te2,1579388628.0,Haha touche! Well perhaps there are 2 markets but either way calling your game Kum is going to be polarizing!
NintendoSwitch,feuotxg,t1_feuhuyv,1579388600.0,"Yeah when you go to a couple's dinner, that's not an invitation to bring 4 friends haha!"
NintendoSwitch,fetoi2h,t1_fet5ivf,1579377630.0,Hmm I'm sure a fair amount of people thought it is Kum.. maybe rethink that. You dont want to have to educate consumers about such an important thing! And I would imagine this isnt the type of game you're looking to advertise on pornhub..
UpliftingNews,fetg75o,t1_fers9r5,1579375148.0,Split into two classes? Sepukku and Suicide? Sepukku has reached all time highs?
smashbros,fetfrf3,t1_feoay15,1579375031.0,They were going nuts before there was even the slightest clue of Banjo. Were they watching the whole direct? Because the exciting part was probably seeing that there was an encore.
NintendoSwitch,fetago9,t1_ferq5ka,1579373326.0,November is a lot more months away from February than a couple!
slaythespire,fena4bb,t1_fem5zpd,1579280274.0,"For sure. This is the type of card you get in act 3 when you picked up Barricade from the A2 boss and you already have a lot of True Grit, Shrug It Off, and some extra energy (or Snecko)."
TheBrewery,felacrx,t1_fekwf21,1579217543.0,"I've definitely sidestepped the 'brewmaster' title and corrected people that it isn't me, but I see what you're saying. To be honest, who the hell cares what the general public calls you. Most of them know less than 10% of what you could talk to them about in the first place, so whether their terminology is respectful or not, can't really do any harm.

I'm not going to go to brewers at other breweries and refer to myself as a brewmaster, but if a doctor from the local hospital feels right calling me that, whats the harm I suppose?"
slaythespire,fel9qt0,t1_fekdu9x,1579217153.0,Could also have a Hand of Greed as one of the last 2 cards. Or Genetic Algorithm to stack! Or Ritual Dagger!!
NintendoSwitch,fel6iy6,t1_fejw08c,1579215119.0,I mean I didnt even know what style of game Fire Emblem was until 3h came out and I looked into it. For that reason I'm ok with Byleth since it's the only character that I recognize of the FE characters. Still would have preferred something different like Hollow Knight!
NintendoSwitch,feitvgc,t1_feht19b,1579147080.0,"I'm at 19, 19 and 20 and still never beat the heart. I never try to either though.. I want to beat a20 with all characters"
slaythespire,fegu15m,t1_fed402v,1579102519.0,I think even more important than those individual comparisons is whether you have a deck that needs a big hp pool. Maybe a strength scaling IC with Reaper. Vs a defense heavy silent where you rarely take more than a couple damage.
slaythespire,fefdiy9,t1_fef5ydy,1579053997.0,Not sure.. I dont think so
slaythespire,fef6ov1,t1_fef3zs2,1579049462.0,"You are giving something up for something else. In this case the tradeoff is a more powerful card with a drawback, with a less powerful card with no drawback."
slaythespire,feewe5m,t1_feedyaa,1579042654.0,"It has no drawback. Opportunity cost of having a different relic isnt a drawback, it's a tradeoff. Busted crown has the drawback of cutting your card choices. Sozu by not allowing you to get potions. Every other energy relic has a DRAWBACK. You can disagree all you want but in this conversation, your stance is wrong."
slaythespire,feevlry,t1_feeuago,1579042168.0,I just double dipped haha. I only had it on switch but I've put almost 200hr in. Easy to justify esp since it's on sale right now for half price!
slaythespire,feeshhk,t3_eoqd09,1579040254.0,"Alright well I have it for switch but I know itll take months for the patch, so this is the first game I've ever double dipped on as a result! Not upset about it though, I've got nearly 200h played and am happy to support MegaCrit"
slaythespire,feerash,t1_feeg10x,1579039534.0,The last update was a LONG delay. Several months. My blood potion was +10% and berserk was 3 vuln for so long after I bought the game. It only just got updated I think a couple weeks ago (i cant remember i havent played much in a while). Hopefully this update will arrive sooner!
NintendoSwitch,feer0y0,t1_fedim6g,1579039372.0,I'm in the brewing industry and was recently in a talk led by the founder of BioWare. When they got bought out by EA things really started going downhill as they turned from a passionate small team into a profit center with corporation designated deadlines and budgets. The dude started two craft breweries and isnt in the gaming industry anymore.

NintendoSwitch,fe6arg6,t1_fe66sy4,1578885669.0,But this isn't r/Nintendo
slaythespire,fdyoigk,t1_fdqxtlw,1578781974.0,The pic shows he was slain by the heart.
slaythespire,fdylw2m,t1_fdy9yd3,1578781235.0,Hahaha alright fair point! My brain hasnt been getting enough sleep I suppose!
NintendoSwitchDeals,fdy3bv5,t1_fdy29cy,1578775617.0,I'm at the point where I'm not very good but I'm kind of bored of it. That's 200 hours in though so I'm not complaining by any means.
slaythespire,fdxwxo5,t1_fdxblbc,1578773784.0,"Is it an IC only relic? I never clued into that. On silent it wouldnt actually be awful..

Edit: I dumb"
NintendoSwitchDeals,fdxcxsu,t1_fdxaxu3,1578767548.0,For sure!
NintendoSwitchDeals,fdxc72u,t1_fdw5hzf,1578767329.0,Story length in roguelike is irrelevant though.
NintendoSwitchDeals,fdxbk83,t1_fdvh5da,1578767212.0,It's super accessible and easy to get into.. and then VERY hard when you start to understand the depth.
NintendoSwitchDeals,fdxaknp,t1_fdwnpip,1578766902.0,"There is no main story in Slay the Spire though. It's a game that can be played however you like, sure. But being A20 on each class could be seen as beating the whole story and unless you know exactly how to play from the minute you start (maybe you've studied YouTube videos??), you're not doing that in under 100 hours."
NintendoSwitchDeals,fdx01cc,t1_fdth1au,1578763938.0,Slay the Spire at 10 hours is laughable. Say hello to my 200 hours and counting.
NetflixBestOf,fdonn67,t1_fdojh4x,1578608844.0,I'm not sure I've seen the last season. Is it fairly recent? I've watched a good amount and its entertaining enough but has enough bad elements that I dont really recommend it. Burkes wife being this otherworldly supportive wife with no self preservation is up there as a weak point for me. Real people just arent like that.
NetflixBestOf,fdo6yi0,t1_fdmf0cb,1578599966.0,"I feel like this show was almost good, but the writing seemed too scripted. Still enjoyable enough to watch but not amazing.."
slaythespire,fdlg6ya,t1_fdkx4v7,1578523330.0,What's common sense for ?
funny,fdkelam,t1_fdk9jf7,1578502219.0,"They're bad guys, not animals!!"
slaythespire,fdiaj8l,t1_fdhnr39,1578438700.0,You mean a hand of 2x turbo and 2x beam cell isnt good??
NintendoSwitch,fdedb3x,t1_fddtjxf,1578336528.0,Ah yeah so not perfect from a story perspective but bearable? I'll probably give it a shot!
NintendoSwitch,fdcq1lx,t1_fdb8lek,1578281174.0,"As someone who has no idea what to spend vouchers on, it seems Fire Emblem might need one of them.. not really into tactics games but it's getting such a good reputation. 

I already have BOTW, smash, smo and mk8d. No idea what to get with my second"
todayilearned,fd5yrmf,t1_fd5hngw,1578183200.0,"Ah ok well yes that is of course an exceptional situation. Sorry, that must make parenting even tougher than it already is."
todayilearned,fd5h7cf,t1_fd3f7ts,1578177605.0,I'm terrified for my 2 year old daughter to grow up. Being a preteen/teen in this age of social media would be fucked. I have some growing up to do before reaching that part.
todayilearned,fd5gycv,t1_fd36n9l,1578177525.0,Haha it certainly can be the hardest part at times!!
todayilearned,fd5gtf6,t1_fd3gimw,1578177476.0,It can be a bit annoying but even in the worst of times I wouldnt say it's the hardest. Sure getting some shit on you when you're out in public isnt ideal!
todayilearned,fd5gl9o,t1_fd3ro5d,1578177395.0,"I think if you're worried about not raising him right, you're already on the right track!"
todayilearned,fd5ggin,t1_fd3zkyt,1578177348.0,Every kid is different.. but I really dont think changing diapers would ever be the HARDEST thing for a parent to do.
todayilearned,fd5gbq5,t1_fd420oz,1578177300.0,Yeah whatever is the best for each family. Just saying men diaper changing really isnt what should be praised.
todayilearned,fd5fwx6,t1_fd43q3y,1578177248.0,I mean each family is different and not changing diapers doesnt make you a horrible person. Maybe mom is ok with diapers but doesnt like cooking and there is an agreement? Everyone has to do what works for them but just be a team player and work together! I change diapers.. a lot. I dont want praise for it. It's a complete joke to get praise for that as a man.
todayilearned,fd5fhlm,t1_fd4x2kj,1578177123.0,Haha havent we all! I'd change 10 dirty diapers to get an extra hour of sleep some nights though !
todayilearned,fd476lr,t1_fd2i0og,1578164981.0,Tired from work is such a joke. Obviously all jobs are different but I'd say the vast majority of jobs are easier than taking care of infants / toddlers.

todayilearned,fd46h1j,t1_fd2nnd3,1578164858.0,"Seriously. I have 2 little ones and I spend as much time with them as I can.. but I'm also trying to get shit done around the house and their naps never line up and it seems like just keeping up with cooking, cleaning, laundry and grocery shopping takes up more time than we have in the day! Mad respect to all the moms out there that have been left with the lions share of this type of work since forever."
todayilearned,fd2yeph,t1_fd2n71x,1578152906.0,"It's actually insane. Also, changing diapers shouldnt be the metric of being a good dad. Changing diapers is not even close to the hardest part about raising little ones."

NintendoSwitch,fcoakht,t1_fcnpkqh,1577827547.0,I cant get into BOTW myself. So theres one data point for you! I wish I could.. and I'll try eventually again.. just didnt click for me after about 4 hours.
NintendoSwitch,fcoah3y,t1_fco59lf,1577827482.0,This is me. I'm 32 and have no idea why Minecraft is good.
NintendoSwitch,fcoa8na,t1_fco7w5g,1577827320.0,I only beat the main story in SMO (so far) but the game is just so fun. It's so simple to get into with such depth if you're a completionist. I didnt spend a ton of time in the game but I thought it was such a good Mario title.
gaming,fcle0gu,t1_fcldcnx,1577745618.0,They're too far gone my friend. Save your words!
NintendoSwitchDeals,fcld1ss,t1_fckwp6d,1577744991.0,FFX is great. If you like 9 I would imagine youd thoroughly enjoy X
nintendo,fcklepo,t1_fckbctj,1577727873.0,"Not really a problem if you're Nintendo and you're happy with your sales! If you're an entitled consumer that expects everything they can imagine (like us), yeah, it sucks!"
videos,fc7um21,t1_fc7bjqd,1577519052.0,"Ascensions are just to provide additional challenge. It's one of my top games for sure. I wouldnt try to convince others why it should be their top, but I love that it's a roguelike that I dont have to be on the edge of my seat. I can relax and still experience challenging, complex gameplay. Every run is very different and while yes, each character has a couple things they do well, what the run offers you will give you very different experiences. Different relics, rares, card synergies can all shape runs."
NintendoSwitch,fc61wbd,t1_fc61nvv,1577470401.0,"Yeah I'm not sure if it's my style of game but it will probably be one of my two.. and then maybe SMM2 or XC2, though I dont think I have the life to accommodate spending so much time to get into XC2."
