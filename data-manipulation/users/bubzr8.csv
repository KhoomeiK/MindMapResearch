Like we’re living currently till we die and after the course of maybe 100 years are eventually forgotten how insignificant are we really? we as a collective species are less than a grain of sand on a supposed infinite beach with no way to see if any other grains of sand are like us, sadly it’s quite possible we’ll never see the true beauty and wonder our universe and only our imagination will show us something close, yet that will all be washed away when our memories eventually die as I said.

And I know you can’t drive however I feel like if you asked your dad for a sip of his beer or hell maybe even your own cup, however you should totally cap it there and wait till like New Years. Don’t try and defy them if they say no cause that’s how teenaged alcoholics are made which you don’t wanna be trust me it’s not as fun as movies and shows make it seem"
