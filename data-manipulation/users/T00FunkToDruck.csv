AmItheAsshole,fdokjj1,t1_fdodngi,1578607001.0,"Depends on the context.  If they have evidence on video that clearly shows a person in the act of doing something they deem suspicious, they can show it to police, whom assumably would want to ask questions first and probably want to search you for the item in question.  

It's legal to tell them no, in which case they'd detain you until they get a search warrent (which really pisses them off since it takes up more of their time). If it comes to this, they arrest/cuff you while they search anything you brought into the store (pockets, bags, jackets, baby stroller, etc). If they find anything, the value of the item(s) taken would determine your punishment.  

From my experience, for example, I had a gf steal a pregnancy test from a reputable big box store. [This particular store has petty theft everyday throughout their 1000s of stores world wide]. She got detained, had to pay a small fee, and have her photo added to a black list that is shared throughout the company network, and was banned from that particular store. 

Again from my experience. Same company different store, a man stole a $2k laptop at night and was later found by police. After the footage was reviewed, they were able to track the location (via GPS on the laptop) of the laptop and waited patiently to hit again (which he did). I didn't hear the entire outcome after being told that he was taken to court and imprisoned (not sure how long). Again from my experience.

Court fees, lawyers, time out of the day and every other resouce/expense necessary to prosecute someone all cost the company money, 

It's a different story if a store has suspicions with no concrete evidence. It's a lot harder to prove anything because the police only have two sides of a story. The employee will voice their side, accusing you while you're left eating the opposite.  Since the employee is the one making the accusation, the police will side with them until you can prove otherwise, hoping you'll just let them look so you can claim the ""I told you so"".

If there is ever ANY kind of physical resistance, you can bet you'll be taken to jail until the case is further investigated.

I hope this answers your question. There are so many different scenarios that they have to be taken on an individual basis.

Sorry my response is so long, I try to be as clear as I can, which can make it even more confusing."

AmItheAsshole,fdnwv0c,t1_fdnmofd,1578594474.0,"In this particular case (OP's post) I would most certainly let a police officer search my bag when I know I didn't take anything because it is *supposed* to be in their best interest to clear up any confusion. Whereas an employee*could* have every intention of setting you up. Yes a police officer could set you up too, but what would they gain in this particular case? The average officer just wants to clear things up and get to the next call if there hasn't been any kind of crime (hence why the police officer in the OP felt the need to exclaim thrir time has been wasted). 

I've worked many retail jobs where if you witness theft, you report it to LP (if there is one) and they handle it the rest of the way, following them discreetly, calling police, etc.  I've also worked in small retail stores that don't have an LP, but have cameras they watch and if I witness suspicious activity, you notify the MOD (in OP's case a Dollar Store Esq shop) who decides how to handle it. 

At no point would I feel the need to take actions (as an employee) in to my own hands aside from telling someone else. There is a protocol for these situations set in place that don't include me demanding a search of someone's private property or unnecessary harassment. Now if I see someone literally put something in their bag or pocket, the only thing I was told I could do was ask ""are you going to pay for that?"" and notify a superior. This particular store had 3 employees max on the clock at any given time with only 1 cash register.

It's not very often I see cashiers chase down thieves much less bully people in to proving their innocence. 

Hope this clears more up, I don't want to spend all afternoon on this."
AmItheAsshole,fdmyxwx,t1_fdmxl2t,1578571862.0,"As a customer, it  IS legal to walk into a store and walk out without buying anything. 

 As an employee, they would have to observe some kind of offence just as you said (camera, witness, what have you) before they contact the appropriate person, whether it's LP, Manager, police, etc.

 The employee themselves aren't allowed to go throwing people to the ground and cuffing them... Suppose that happened and they found nothing. I guarantee you there'd be a lawsuit and they'd be out of a job.

It doesn't sound like this is a store has 30+ employees, so there probably wasn't an LP even with cameras in the store.  The employee calling the manager, who called the police, was the correct course of action if this is the case

EDIT: formatting"
AmItheAsshole,fdmvqi1,t1_fdmvd1w,1578568054.0,"I carry a bag daily and the only person I trust to hold on to it is my wife. If a store isn't going to let me bring in my bag, I'll take my business elsewhere. Anytime people accuse me of stealing, I gladly invite them to call the appropriate authorities to search it. 

Unless you're running out the door with merchandise that is obviously from THAT store, they can't do anything but contact police. Anything else is grounds for a lawsuit.

Edit:I understand not being from the US, so you're probably not as familiar with our [4th Amendment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)."
AmItheAsshole,fdmv2ir,t1_fdmsf0y,1578567174.0,"But not to detain, harrass, or impede on anyone's civil rights. It's not like they had a car to put the bag in. Would you ask a stranger outside to hold your bag, phone, wallet, or any other personal belongings while I go shop for an undetermined amount of time. They can be suspicious all they want, but they're not legally allowed to search you. 

The most they can legally do is call the police after they leave the store if they have speculation something is stolen.  

Know you're rights, you can even tell police officers ""no, you cannot search me, my car, bag (or whatever) without probable cause or a warrent"". Being bullied into giving up those rights is the average citizen's first mistake.

As far as OP being an asshole, no, they just know their rights and stood their ground.

EDIT: to OP, disregard their statement of wasting their [police] time. They did their job and for them to say that you wasted THEIR is them trying to get you to second guess standing up for yourself in the future."
