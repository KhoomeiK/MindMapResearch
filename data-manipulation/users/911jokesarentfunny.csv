IPhones to iPhone communication uses imessage which supports larger file sizes. IPhone to Android communication uses SMS because Android does not have imessage. SMS is an old technology that essentially piggyback on existing signals and thus does not support large file sizes (it was designed for text). MMS is also older and cannot send large files either. Videos shot on your phone are most likely in 1080P or potentially 4K which means that the file size is very large. Therefore, in order to send it over the older services that don't support large files, it gets compressed which causes it to lose detail and clarity."

If you're enrolled half time and fail a class then you've only completed 3 credits while being funded for half time and thus your scholarship won't renew. Or something like that. 

I took 7 last Spring and it renewed so I can guarantee they don't require 12 per semester anymore. Besides that semester I'm a full time student. Also, SFA told me in person that you just need 6 credits to be funded and that there was no more 24 credit per year requirement so I'm pretty confident that you don't need the 12 per semester even if you're a full time student.

As far as baiting, I've put bait everywhere in the kitchen. Draw slides, cabinet hinges, cracks, etc. Honestly though they seem to prefer the Combat Max roach motels, I guess since they're enclosed. I've seen a few crawl in there, I haven't seen any eat the gel though. All in all it seems to be getting better but I figured an IGR is never a bad idea."
explainlikeimfive,fd3264i,t1_fcxpek6,1578154042.0,APR shouldn't even be a consideration when you pick a card because you should be paying it off in full before the interest is charged anyways.
explainlikeimfive,fd31sjj,t1_fcym76c,1578153904.0,"Yes it is, tons of cars have it. There's an e-LSD in the Veloster N for example, tons of AWD ICE cars use computer to determine where to send more if the power (front or back)."

pestcontrol,fd2s5j7,t1_fd126k3,1578151149.0,"No I sprayed, let it dry, then baited with Maxforce Magnum. And I know it's not ideal to spray multiple chemicals on top of one another but my issue is that I need to put down the IGR and I'm concerned that spraying the liquid over the Demon residue could mess it up (because it dries to a powder), that's why I figured I'd go ahead and mix the IGR with the Temprid."
pestcontrol,fd00ybk,t3_eixzk8,1578111993.0,"I've been wondering that too, I Googled their ingredients and it seems that Gentrol (hydroprene if I remember correctly) is more effective. I was looking at Martin's because of price but you can actually get a 1oz bottle of Gentrol (enough for one gallon which should be good for an apartment) for like $10 on Domyown with free shipping. That's what I ended up getting."
