Sorry, but service industry workers seem to have a huge problem with realizing who sets their work conditions. I guess because their wages come from customers, they also believe it’s up to customers to change the conditions for their jobs (never order these items from OUR menu, closing at 10 actually means don’t come in after 9). Your restaurants don’t care about how difficult your job is, and instead of demanding them to change things, you tell ordinary people how awful they are for doing what the restaurant encourages them to do."

gaybros,ff7m0pi,t1_ff7hyuo,1579652757.0,"A much simpler rebuttal: are you still able to orgasm from masturbation while watching porn? If so, it’s not true you need emotional connection to orgasm."
gaybros,ff7l88y,t1_ff7hyuo,1579652208.0,"That just doesn’t make sense to me, not only because I can’t relate but because it just doesn’t match what we know about sexuality. Not to get dark, but it’s widely known that even rape victims can (and not infrequently do) orgasm during their attack. If someone can achieve orgasm during a traumatic experience like that (filled with very negative emotions, not just the absence of loving ones) then I find it impossible to believe that there are some people whose sexual responses won’t kick in unless they’re in the right emotional state. 

Have you actually experienced this during meaningless sex? Or is this just what you imagine would be the case if you were to have sex outside your relationship? And if you have experienced it, you’re absolutely sure it’s not attributable to a lack of attraction or arousal?

I’m the kind of guy who used to say he “can’t cum from blowjobs.” Lo and behold, when I find a guy really hot and I’m really turned on I find myself cumming during blowjobs, much to my surprise. I realize now that telling myself I couldn’t cum from blowjobs was me drawing a false conclusion from my experiences. The fact was that I just wasn’t as aroused those many other times. Sufficient arousal plus stimulation added up to an orgasm. 

The “we’re all different” argument, which you seem to be using, is often just a way of shutting down any scientific thought about the body. When you haven’t taken a shit in two weeks,  your doctor doesn’t say “idk, it’s different for all of us.” He declares something is wrong and helps you fix it. Sex and orgasm are bodily functions - the same thing applies. They’re not mysterious and unique to every individual. Stimulation during sexual arousal (driven by physical attraction) leads to orgasm.

Honestly, I imagine you take pride in not being able to orgasm unless you feel a connection (you don’t see it as lowering the quality of your life or getting in your way), right? That should be your first clue that maybe your introspection on this matter is pretty biased.

So I don’t come off as an asshole (I’m sure many will still read my comment that way, but I’ll at least put this on the record) - of course you’re allowed to have sex the way you want. You’re allowed to require an emotional connection before having sex with someone, absolutely. But it’s straight up ridiculous to say that it’s impossible for you to orgasm without an emotional connection, that’s nothing short of pseudoscience. And it leads to these virtue signaling threads that reek of “I’m not like those other promiscuous gays!”"
gaybros,ff78p3k,t1_ff6ztud,1579643323.0,"I knew I would find the first part of your comment in this thread before I even looked. OP is right, sex is physical “first.” It’s a physical act, arousal is a physical thing. The sensations and orgasm are triggered by physical relations. There’s nothing shameful about that. No human being alive “needs” emotional connection to be aroused, to have sex, and to achieve orgasm. 

Now, sure, there are people who prefer to make an emotional connection first. It’s also true that emotion can enhance the pleasure you get (love and orgasm must feel better than just orgasm, right?). But this whole “I NEED emotional connection before I have sex” comes off as a way to defend yourself against the horny, promiscuous gay stereotype. I see it from straight people on Reddit, too, but I see it so much more often on the gay subreddits. It feels like a way to act superior, because like I said before nobody literally needs emotional connection to have sex (besides lust, maybe, but we know that’s not the emotion people like this mean).

Admitting you can have meaningless sex (and you can, everyone can) doesn’t make you a whore."

You’re seriously going to argue that this is completely implausible? That’s not a ridiculous scenario, it’s totally believable.

Our brains get used to actions we repeat over and over again. Your conscious thoughts actually have less “control” over your actions than you think they do.

TwoXChromosomes,fezbex0,t1_fewa7j8,1579455672.0,"I agree with you and the majority of posters here. 

But the “anti-gay until it affects me” thing *never* gets this kind of reaction from people. Instead, it’s always celebrated and sometimes people even act like it’s necessary for people to become tolerant of gays. Moreover, people (even other gays) tell you you need to give your family at least a year to mourn their old idea of you after you come out. It’s always nice to hear people “need time” to get used to you existing as you are. Then they tell you “think of how long it took for you to accept yourself!” Yes, it took that long *because* of people like that...

AskReddit,fevkqfe,t1_fevi15f,1579398559.0,"It wasn’t confusing beyond the way a good mystery should be. But even then the hints started revealing it until you were pretty much ready for the reveal. If your complaint was that the reveal wasn’t completely, wholly unexpected, then we just have different tastes in mysteries (I don’t want a mystery whose solution isn’t hinted at all...)

It started becoming clear that something was up besides Marta accidentally killing the author. And of course there were hints that Ransom was involved (him knowing she should check her email, for example). But you’re saying it’s obvious it was him - it’s just not. Because it was no longer a matter of “this guy’s throat was cut, who did the cutting?” If you think it was obvious that Ransom “did it,” then you’re telling me it was obvious exactly what he did. When did that become obvious?

I think you’ve just applied a terrible heuristic to judge the movie (if the standout bad boy is the culprit, then it’s bad), and now you’re retroactively trying to justify your judgment and it doesn’t make sense. This theory goes well with your comment “I just assumed the whole time Ransom did it”, sounds like you’re used to making up your mind on something and then turning your brain off."

But more than that, it just couldn’t have ended the real way. It’s not what the movie was about. At best it would fit in very oddly with the rest of the movie, at worst the comedic and otherwise non-serious elements of the rest of the movie would have ended up being disrespectful to memories of the victims of the murders.

AskReddit,feuzyei,t1_feu5y3l,1579391593.0,"Your complaints don’t actually make sense together. There’s no reason to suspect Ransom when he finally becomes a recognizable character because, like you said,  the mystery is supposedly solved after the first twenty minutes to half an hour.

Also, the “obvious” guy is usually someone you’d discount, so it’s not necessarily bad to have the most suspicious suspect be the culprit, as long as the story around it stays interesting.

Second, the reason this joke is supposed to be funny in the episode is because for most straight couples monogamy is assumed, so it’s silly to specifically ask your partner not to cheat. With gay guys, though, open relationships are more common and so monogamy *is* often a conversation and you can imagine “asking a partner not to cheat” is a real thing.

If we’re using the bullseye example, the answer is no. If you’re accurate, then all of your shots are going to be relatively close to the bullseye. Therefore, they are going to be close to each other, and thus your shots were precise. Accuracy implies precision, and thus there can’t be accuracy without precision. You can move the goalposts and tell me “well maybe the shots weren’t close enough to each other to be considered precise.” But if that’s the case, your threshold for accuracy is a lot more lenient than your threshold for precision, and you ought to have a good explanation for that."
