You've fallen into a mindset many are faced with today. Waiting for life to happen to you. When you need to make it happen FOR you. One mindset resigns and waits for whatever comes your way. The other, seeks out opportunities and tries to make things happen until they DO happen. 

Comfort is your enemy. It's the real reason why you lack motivation and you ARE resigning your life away. For this to end, you have to place yourself in uncomfortable situations. That means FACING YOUR FEARS, with small baby steps. Or if you're truly brave throwing yourself into situations that force growth. 

If your afraid of public speaking, throw yourself into a class with tons of it. If you're afraid of interviews, that means your going out on an interview. Don't think from the perspective that you have to succeed. Or you have to impress. Or you have to sell yourself. Your confidence is low right now. You just need to see some kind of action taking place. Failure is going to happen. Life is ALL about it. Failure is how we learn and grow. 

So just think about a few good things about yourself. (I know what you're thinking - there are none.. ) then think of a few characteristics, a few values you'd like to HAVE. Instead of saying you are those things, say you're striving to gain them. Be honest but don't lie. Don't cut yourself down either. Acknowledge you have some work to do on yourself and their are some areas you want improvement. Don't overthink it, just do it. Better to DO than to THINK. You're stuck in a thinking situation. You need to forget that, start doing. You don't need to plan. Plans will just keep you thinking. Just do things without thought. Do an interview with this mindset and don't worry about getting the job or the interview going over well. Who cares, just do it and move on. If you did it! CONGRATULATIONS MAN! That's a BIG WIN!! That's a BIG SUCCESS! 

Don't hate yourself for feeling weak and pathetic. Use this weakness as a motivation to build strength. Don't allow the shame friends or family use to get to you. That's only going to set you back. If they try, acknowledge that you're making efforts to succeed now to yourself. Know that they think shaming you is helping you when all it's doing is incentivizing you to quit or give up with suicide. But NOW that you are a different person. Shame is now your brother in arms. This is where never giving up comes into play. You're going to face a barrage of slights thrown your way, this'll build emotional fortitude. So they are making you stronger when they do this. Think to yourself, thank you sir, thank you mam, may I have another? Use it to lite a fire under your bottom. Every time you feel it or hear it, you become Rocky Balboa. The guy who just won't go down. Who keeps coming back for more, no matter what everyone else throws at you. 

You're going to succeed, it's just a matter of time. YOU GOT THIS!"

offmychest,fdyql2c,t3_en0lq3,1578782548.0,"A piece of her lives on in you. The memories, the shared experiences, who she was as a person. How she touched your life and that part of her will always be with you. 

Thank you for sharing your story."
offmychest,fdtz8zp,t3_en21yk,1578724692.0,"There's a lot of distrust going on in the world at the moment. And rightly so. Many people are taking advantage of their responsibilities and doing things they shouldn't be. There are consequences to the wholesale betrayal of public trust. And society is experiencing the backlash from it. 

Your particular problem has to do with the internet. You can't really form a deep meaningful relationship without having contact with a person IN person. It's how trust is built between people. Anyone can pose as anything online. Anyone can say anything. Anyone can do anything. Unless they can see you in person, get to know the REAL you, not the person you present yourself as. Only then can they start to trust you. 

Being around a person in person allows you to really get familiar with them. To understand what kind of person they are. I know this is probably not the kind of answer you want, but I'd unplug from the computer now and then. Maybe try talking to people more often in person. You'll start picking up on the connection you share with them and others."
offmychest,fdtu1rd,t3_en2tzf,1578722206.0,"Sorry to hear that. People drift apart, it doesn't mean it has anything to do with you. Your just on different paths heading towards different destinations in life. Those things you used to enjoy change. It's doesn't mean you are any less valuable as a person. All it means is that your different people now and the things you once shared are no longer there.

I've had friends growing up that drifted into a lifestyle that we just did not share. I've had friends I've known for most of my adolescent years move away. They matured into completely different people than they once were. Life is full of change, people change, we change tastes, seek out different things from life. For one reason or the other, your paths are no longer entwined. It'll be okay. There will be many others. Cherish the time you had and look forward to what other friendships the future brings."
offmychest,fdtr1uu,t3_en307y,1578720870.0,"Question, do you feel weak and desire to be strong? Have you ever felt helpless? Is it not good enough to have a man to rely on? If you were a small thin and weak man, would that make you happy? How would you fit in better with men if you were one? Do you feel like you're missing out because you're a woman? Did you get along with your parents? Which parent did you feel closest too?"
