SandersForPresident,ffk1iaq,t1_ffjnk5i,1580012941.0,"When I get back on Wed I'll dm you. You can then explain exactly your situation (the medical name of the condition, plus the nature of the treatment necessary). I'll check with the health insurance company whether for that condition you would have to wait a certain amount of time between signing up for the plan and being able to use it (in your case, I don't think it would be a problem; it is an issue with certain things like cataracts, although in my case, even though I had a cataract in addition to my other problem, my plan still covered me). You can also sleep on my couch if you do come. No problem.

I'll dm you. Be well"
SandersForPresident,ffjmfax,t3_etyk4c,1580001615.0,"I live in Barcelona. There are a lot of eye clinics here, including a medical center specializing in retinal problems, in addition to the world famous Opthalmology Clinic Barraquer. I myself had surgery there for an epiretinal membrane a few years ago. My private insurance here in Spain covered it.

I'm going out of town until Wed night, but I when I get back I can check anything you want for you. You can sign up for a private health plan, much cheaper and with many fewer bullshit pre-existing exclusion conditions, than plans in the states. You'll be covered from the moment you sign up. A friend of mine from another country did it. In addition, they don't look for any excuse not to cover you. 

Please let me know how I can help you.

Be well"

This is why the MEK has almost no support inside Iran. The war saw intense trench warfare, and the widespread use of chemical weapons by the Iraqis."
samharris,ffj601y,t1_ffegz8d,1579991269.0,"And you know why in many cases the civil rights leaders were straight up communists ? Because often communists were the only ones who weren't racists, and who openly embraced African Americans."
SandersForPresident,ffj2xmy,t1_ffj21sa,1579989051.0,"Actually on the Krystal Ball show they talked about this exact point. She said that ironically Obama's 'capitalist' (ie economic) interests might prevent him from doing anything that would be perceived as harming Bernie, since he and Michelle basically make their money by being influencers, something which by its very nature is aimed at young people."
SandersForPresident,ffh22oo,t1_ffgzkpm,1579921022.0,"It won't come from MAGA people. It will come from Wall St (investment banks, private equity, hedge funds) hiring ex special ops forces. There's a large number of ex military who work in finance. The most dangerous time will be from when it's clear that Bernie will be the nominee until the convention. After the convention, he'll receive increased secret service protection. And once he's president, in addition to the much greater protection he would have, the reputational damage to the country as a whole -- ie it can't even protect it's own president -- would be too great IMHO to allow him to be killed. 

I'm not a conspiracy theorist at all -- conspiracy thinking is lazy, incorrect thinking, in the same way that someone can swim incorrectly. But I would be shocked if it hasn't been already talked about among finance people, and I would be even more shocked if when it's clear that he'll be nominee it won't be seriously considered. 

The great sociologist Adolph Reed -- who everybody should really read or listen to in interviews (Nathan Robinson had a long two hour interview with him that's on youtube) -- said as much, 'they'll try to kill him', when he was interviewed on Krystal Ball's show."
samharris,ff7h0zb,t3_es2130,1579649355.0,"I don't understand why Eric Weinstein doesn't publish his work. He can even post it to arxiv, without worrying about peer-review. This is how scientists communicate and evaluate each others work. Fake it until you make it might be how silucon valley works, but in physics there's a slightly more rigorous standard that applies: demonstrating -- either via observation or experiment -- how nature works."

SuicideWatch,ff4uxiy,t3_ernou9,1579573042.0,Why not try to spend more time with the people who you said are the reason you haven't killed yourself before ?
SuicideWatch,ff4ulgf,t3_ernqpv,1579572811.0,Have they told you they'd prefer you to be dead ?
SuicideWatch,ff4ec4o,t1_ff1o2y6,1579561590.0,"I understand. I hope you begin to feel better. If you ever want to, just DM me. Be well"
SandersForPresident,ff4e4ry,t1_ff4ds9x,1579561454.0,I think the post perfectly fine. Don't remove it.
