Documentaries,ffdv4jx,t3_et35ad,1579829692.0,"Davidson said, “Bow is down. Bow is down.”

A transmission came in, someone yelling over the roar of the storm. Davidson yelled back. “Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get into your rafts. Throw all your rafts to the water.”

“Throw the rafts in the water. Roger.”

Davidson radioed, “Everybody! Everybody get off! Get off the ship! Stay together!”

Hamm said, “Cap! Cap!” He was having a hard time climbing the deck.

Clinging to the high side, unable to reach Hamm, Davidson kept urging him to try.

Hamm said, “You gonna leave me?”
Davidson answered firmly, “I’m not leaving you. Let’s go.”

A low rumbling began and did not let up. It was the sound of El Faro going down. The last words heard on the bridge are Davidson’s. He is crying out to Hamm: “It’s time to come this way!”

============

Those the final sounds recorded by the voyage data recorder on the doomed cargo ship, El Faro. The final moments on the bridge were neither heroic nor glorious-- the helmsman, Hamm, overweight and diabetic, unable to exit the bridge due to the ship's growing list, and the captain, Davidson, refusing to leave him. The audio then cuts out, probably due to water hitting the microphone. Neither man had the time to even dawn a life preserver before being swallowed by the angry Atlantic Ocean.

The remainder of the crew were not in a much better position. Though they had mustered near the ship's two lifeboats, this was no ordinary storm. Due to a combination of poor weather forecasting, toxic corporate culture, and sheer stubbornness on the part of the captain, the El Faro had steamed directly into the inner wall of Hurricane Joaquin. With an extreme list to port, merciless waves, and hurricane force winds, it was impossible to deploy the lifeboats. The crew's only recourse was to toss life rafts into the water. Given the extreme conditions, the crew may as well have hopped into the ocean in only their underwear.

One of the men mustered near the lifeboats in those frantic final moments was David Holland, from a small lake town in western Maine. I knew him personally.

All 33 souls aboard the El Faro were lost. No remains have been recovered. We will never know if the terrified crew survived a while in the life rafts, or if they were slammed against the hull and sucked into the deep. The silent wreck of the El Faro, three miles beneath the waves, and the haunting 26 hours of recording of the bridge are the only pieces of evidence. (Within those hours, various crew members implored the captain at least six times to alter course. Davidson, eyeing a potential promotion, disregarded them.)

This brief documentary published by the National Transportation Safety Board covers the investigation in aftermath of the El Faro's disappearance-- the discovery of the wreck, the difficult search for the voyage data recorder, and the board's recommendations to prevent a future maritime disaster of this magnitude.

If you are interested in a more in depth look at the sinking of the El Faro, here is a beautifully written but grim long form article:

There is a lot of literature on the ""cleanliness"" aspect of circumcision, and despite misconceptions on the internet, there's no denying that a chopped penis is less likely to transmit STDs or develop penile skin conditions compared to an unchopped penis.

comedyheaven,fedw1gb,t1_fedmkhe,1579021089.0,"On August 14, 1999, I was assaulted by a man in a Chuck E Cheese costume. Despite my pleas, he continued to violate me, eventually mangling my vagina beyond all recognition. I was found by a functional heroin addict named Zeke and rushed to the hospital. Thus began the slow and painful healing process.

I had four reconstructive surgeries. Every time a Chuck E Cheese commercial came on (which was about twice every three minutes), I had horrible flashbacks. I held a lot of anger and resentment in my heart. Why me? Why now? Why Chuck E Cheese?

But it was there that I met a wonderful nurse named Susan. She let me cry on her shoulder. She held my hand through my darkest hours. She taught me to let go of the hatred and to forgive. Though my body was broken, my heart became pure and strong.

I was a new woman when I walked out of Mercy General. I had grown in ways I did not think possible. I had a message. I wanted to show the world how much I had been through, somehow. It was then that I remembered my favorite meal at the hospital, and I realized that through the power of cooking, I could share my story.

**Mercy General Ice Water**

Ingredients:

- 8 oz clean water

- ice (optional)

Instructions:

- pour the water into a glass of your choosing.

- add ice (optional).

Now you have a cool, refreshing beverage for any occasion. This recipe is my story. The sound of water being swallowed is my song.

Enjoy!"

Summer-- July-September

Same official season, but radically different climate.

I rambled on and on about how big the meeting was, and how my lazy co-workers were making our department look bad by not pulling their weight, and how ruined my life would be if things didn't go well...

After listening patiently to all my anxious thoughts, my therapist leaned forward and quietly said, ""it sounds like you've chosen to assign a lot of meaning to this.""

I'm pretty sure that my brain audibly misfired. Then I burst into tears.
