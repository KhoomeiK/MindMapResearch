suspiciouslyspecific,ff7z9iz,t1_ff5zdx0,1579661924.0,"I used to be in a fb group where someone posted a story about a guy who got like 5-10 years in prison for a situation like this. I liked a comment saying there should be consequences for the girl lying about her age (she had a fake ID and was on an 18 plus dating app so she fully knew what she was doing.) The girl ended up being like 12 or something ridiculous and people kept saying he should have known since she was so young (I think he was like anywhere between 20 and 25 years old... like yeah 12 is really young so you should be able to see that, but honestly sometimes I see 12 year olds that look older than me and I’m 19. They called me a rape apologist and banned me for thinking the girl should face consequences."
offmychest,ff7vvak,t1_ff7c1ub,1579659589.0,That’s awesome! Sadly I couldn’t donate my hair due to it being dyed and damaged :(
offmychest,ff5udco,t1_ff5u75e,1579610565.0,"I’m going to look at getting some headscarves tomorrow, I have a rectangular one which makes it supper uneven, but I’m planning to wear them until I feel comfortable in front of others :) 

Thank you so much for the advice, it’s pretty difficult adjusting to this :)"
offmychest,ff5u0a2,t1_ff5ttfr,1579610193.0,"I’m so excited to go on this hair journey, I don’t really plan to keep it short as I would love to try and grow my hair as long as possible (have never grown it past my boobs). 

I’m just a little worried about when it’s in the awkward stages of growth, I really don’t want to cut it a lot but I don’t want to look like a baby bird ahah, do you have any styling tips? Or just tips in general to sort of rock it a bit more?"
offmychest,ff5ttns,t1_ff5tk2e,1579609999.0,"I honestly am so scared to go to work, I’ve found it hard being comfortable around other people that I’m not already super comfortable with. I’m quite a shy person in general but I’ll be dealing with a lot of people tomorrow which sort of freaks me out. 

I’ve learned to tie a head scarf so I’ll probably wear them to work to avoid any negative attention until it grows out long enough for me to style. They’re super cute and I’ve always wanted to wear one, but my hair always got in the way of it."
offmychest,ff5kgh4,t1_ff5jcho,1579597175.0,"I’m surprised about the shape of my head tbh, it’s a lot nice looking than I expected which was definitely a pleasant surprise"
offmychest,ff54bj0,t1_ff3xxhp,1579579852.0,I always wore a hat to hide how gross my hair looked beforehand 😂😂
offmychest,ff53wxw,t1_ff2resl,1579579537.0,"I can’t wait to grow my hair out after this, I know it’ll take a while but I’m happy it’ll be healthy"
offmychest,ff53km2,t1_ff2sndc,1579579270.0,"Oh man, I feel like I’ll get more comments from the drinks at my work since I work nights in a bar, I’m genuinely afraid of what they’ll say to me :/"
offmychest,ff53hau,t1_ff4dnfv,1579579202.0,"When you’ve never dyed your hair or had your natural hair change tone, it’s tempting to not experiment with colour."
offmychest,ff53e7p,t1_ff4bsyq,1579579135.0,"The only thing I can tell you is just do it! I had thought about it a bit over the last few months of crying over how awful my hair colour and quality was. Last night I decided to actually ask people (who all said no) but it gave me the strong urge to just do it. It was nearly 11 at night but I asked my boyfriend to help me out right now or I’ll never go through with it, then I just did it."
offmychest,ff539ma,t1_ff45zcs,1579579036.0,"I’m so happy you’re happy now! Hair is a really big part of your life, especially when you’re young. I realised I never would have done this in high school purely because I was worried about what other people would say."
offmychest,ff5356r,t1_ff43rqr,1579578943.0,"I was tearing up thinking about doing it, but I tried to make it as fun as I could. I had shoulder length hair so we put a bowl on my head and went for a bowl cut. 

We got a laugh out of it and there wasn’t a single time I felt sad or regretful about going through with it. The only issue I have now is facing people I haven’t seen or told yet, I still have insecurities but I don’t regret shaving my head. 

I’ve known for a while that it’s the best chance I have at fixing my hair fully rather than just putting hair treatment after hair treatment in my hair weekly. My hair would feel great after each one but it wouldn’t last. 

I feel happy knowing I’ve taken a step in the right direction at fixing my mistake, there’s no way I can be upset about it :)"

offmychest,ff3dtj7,t1_ff3awpx,1579539085.0,"I have a half experience of when I close my door, I feel the air a lot more and it’s crazy, haven’t been outside yet as it’s very early in the morning"
offmychest,ff38ov6,t1_ff38mrp,1579536321.0,"It’s so crazy! I had a shower after I shaved it and just wow, the difference is huge"
