reactivedogs,ffigdx3,t1_ffi65if,1579973237.0,"Yep, you’re absolutely correct! I’m an adoption coordinator for a group that rescues primarily large and extra large dogs, including a lot of livestock guardians. Because a lot of larger breed dogs can be somewhat challenging (size wise and behaviorally), we make a lot of our adopters do breed screenings for certain breeds before they can set up a meet and greet with a dog of that breed and a volunteer who is initinately familiar with the breed talks through specific characteristics with the prospective adopter. We do this for pyrs, mastiffs, Saint Bernards, and many other breeds and I really wish more rescues did something similar because I’ve spoken to SO MANY adopters who thought pyrs were just basically white golden retrievers, and I’ve seen plenty of rescue groups place pyrs in really inappropriate homes. 

We certainly don’t want to gate keep breeds, but like you said, it can be really easy to get in over your head (and big dogs who misbehave are a bigger danger than small dogs who misbehave), so we want to make sure adopters are knowledgeable and prepared for anything their dog might throw at them. We’re also very focused on matchmaking - not just getting a dog adopted into any home but into a home compatible with their needs, so we do have a lot of requirements for pyr homes and people are often unhappy with that, but we do it for a reason."
reactivedogs,ffi4v0x,t1_ffgyqbu,1579965129.0,"So... this is great advice for herding breeds but the Great Pyrenees is *not* a herding breed. It is a Livestock Guardian breed. There’s a very important distinction here because Pyrs are not supposed to “herd” the livestock they protect - they’re supposed to monitor the pack and alert to threats. What this dog is displaying is not herding instinct - it’s protection.

OP - your dog is not trustworthy with strangers because he’s protective of you and your home, and this is 100% breed standard. I would strongly recommend you hire a trainer experienced with LGDs who can help teach you ways to manage your dog when you have guests over, and who will help you evaluate whether or not there’s a way you can do safe intros to help your dog get comfortable with visitors. Some pyrs can do intros and be fine, some should just be separated from visitors altogether. 

Pyrs are gorgeous dogs and the gentlest of giants with their pack, but they are a protective breed by nature and they’re stubborn as hell because they were bred to be independent thinkers, so your average dog trainer without LGD experience may not be well-equipped to handle a pyr. Make sure your trainer has demonstrated LGD experience. Local (and national) breed clubs/groups will be helpful resources for you in learning to manage and train your pyr effectively."
puppy101,ffgmo5y,t1_ffgbwem,1579909792.0,"It sounds like Phoebe’s rescuer definitely has the very best intentions but from your description, it definitely sounds like Phoebe’s quality of life would be worse with her. And I’ll be honest - I looked back through your posts and Phoebe is adorable and fluffy, which is great but... it also means that people are going to fall head over heels in love with her the second they see her photo and will likely overestimate their abilities to manage her behaviors. And if she does well with strangers, a meet and greet is going to go great and she could very well go off to a home with a family who can’t manage her. Because we can tell people til we’re blue in the face all about a dog’s bite history and behavioral concerns/issues, but until adopters see it, they never really believe it. Especially with a dog as cute as Phoebe. 

Ugh, I can totally sympathize with you both and my heart just breaks for you. I absolutely can’t imagine my life without dogs now that I have them, but I can also understand how incredibly hard this has been for you both. When you adopt a dog (especially a puppy), you have this picture in your head of how things are going to turn out. You expect 10+ years (depending on the size of your dog) of bliss, and it can be really, really hard to let go of that dream even in the midst of all the challenges. And once you have, it’s really hard to believe in that dream ever again. 

You and your husband are incredibly dedicated dog owners and clearly love Phoebe very, very much, and I’m so sorry for you both. I hope that whatever you decide, you’re able to find strength and peace, and that with time, your husband will be open to the idea of owning another dog, because any dog would be very lucky to have you."
reactivedogs,fffzni1,t1_fffrmja,1579895289.0,"The thing about innate aggression (aka unprovoked violence vs an “aggressive” reaction triggered by a fight or flight situation)  is you can’t train it out. You can only manage it. And management fails because we’re humans and mistakes happen. When management fails, the consequences can be quite literally lethal. You can’t “correct” aggression and trying usually just results in more aggression."
puppy101,fffyjfa,t1_fffoqeb,1579894601.0,"Puppy biting and aggressive biting by a puppy are very distinct. OP doesn’t sound like your average joe schmoe off the street who can’t tell the difference. Just because her puppy hasn’t done any significant damage yet, it’s only a matter of time before the bites escalate and it’s not responsible or ethical to wait until someone gets seriously injured. 

It’s extreme to assume Phoebe’s reaction in the described scenario was because she was “spooked.” Most spooked dogs are not going to get up and cross a room to approach the scary thing and bite... they’re going to retreat unless cornered. 

OP, you’ve tried so incredibly hard. So much harder than most people would. I’d say the majority of the people commenting on this post probably haven’t ever owned/dealt with an aggressive/reactive dog, at least not one with this level of aggression. You’re doing the right and responsible thing by pondering the hard questions and I’m so sorry for the response you’ve gotten here. You’re a wonderful dog owner and whatever you decide, I hope you find supportive, compassionate, understanding people to surround yourself with."
puppy101,fffheiy,t1_ffedk50,1579884011.0,"Can you give OP the name of one of these supposed rescues or shelters that have an unlimited supply of money and accept aggressive dogs? Because I work in rescue and approx. 99% of the rescues I know and work with will not take aggressive dogs. There are SO MANY non-aggressive dogs dying in shelters everyday and the sad reality is that we can’t save them all, so most rescues and shelters focus on saving the most adoptable dogs. Rescues and shelters also generally rely on donations or government funding (in the case of city/county shelters). An open admission shelter will euthanize this dog and a closed admission (“no kill”) shelter is extremely unlikely to accept this dog. 

OP has done an incredible job trying to prevent and then correct this situation. Certainly there’s massive variance in the quality of trainers/vets/behaviorists in this field but OP has worked with many different professionals - are you implying they’re all utterly terrible?? 

When a dog that has been socialized and trained from a young age is already exhibiting extreme, unpredictable aggression, there’s almost surely a genetic component - that the dog is just wired wrong - and you can’t train that out. This dog will never be trustworthy with humans and for the sake of public safety, should not be placed with someone else - not a rescue, not a shelter, not even a trainer to be frank. The trainers who accept extremely aggressive dogs like this are not usually actually qualified to help them - they’re egotistical maniacs with savior complexes who want to show that they can turn any dog around. A responsible, ethical trainer is not going to take in a dog with this extreme a level of aggression. Sure, there are exceptions, but any good trainer who might accept a dog like this probably already has several of them. 

I’ve seen OP ask for suggestions from pretty much everyone who’s suggested that there’s someone who can save this dog and they usually don’t get any further response after that because everyone has this idea that there’s some incredibly capable person out there with endless time, resources, mental health capacities (bc dealing with a dog like this wears on a person’s mental health), and willingness to help aggressive dogs, but I’ve not yet seen anyone who’s actually made any concrete referrals for OP. So unless you have a referral or are a trainer offering to take this dog in yourself, you don’t get to tell OP that they haven’t tried hard enough or that they must be using bad trainers/vets/behaviorists."

Her breed makeup is very similar to my foster, Prim! Prim’s last foster family ran a wisdom panel on her and she’s 50% standard bulldog, 37.5% American Bulldog and 12.5% mastiff. She has the red coloring of a DDB though so we suspect her “mastiff” DNA could still be DDB."
Dogtraining,fe05fg8,t1_fdzk40n,1578803497.0,"If you’re worried about a bite (and that seems rational based on this behavior) because you can’t control people who come up to him in public, then you shouldn’t be taking him out in public anymore."
