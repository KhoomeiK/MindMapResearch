iamatotalpieceofshit,fehjn00,t1_fehgidp,1579117895.0,"there is another man, just a town over, who lives off his land, and if anyone were to argue with my mother, she would simply point out the fact that this guy has over a thousand gallons of rainwater exposed to open air. Her 115 gal mean nothing, considering they are screened, and cleaned. And his were giant open tanks."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fehdcpq,t1_feh64df,1579114224.0,"My mom had three 55 gallon rain barrels piped together before we got a drought when I was little (I think the drought was in 95) and my towns only cop wound up coming and arresting her for wasting water in my small town during a really bad drought where we were told not to water grass or vegetation. She said nothing, had my grandparents look after me for a few days, and when she went before the judge she asked when it became illegal to distribute collected rain water. The cop never fucking asked and had picked on my mom numerous times before that and she sued him. Damn I forgot how badly I hated him, he got forcibly retired and spent the rest of his days drinking to death. 

Kinda sorry for ranting, I don't have many memories of my mom that come back like that, she was badass and I miss her often."

You'll never know until you try. I know it can sound scary, but you could either have the chance of being happy, or make things awkward for a little bit. I wouldn't worry about it too much, if she's understanding, she won't judge you for it."

He had his gallbladder removed, and had a lot of complications, and I would say maybe a month-and-a-half later this is what happened. Never seen a man so upset about being trapped in the hospital for so long, because he could not stop bleeding or heal."
AskReddit,fcresbh,t1_fcq9r9r,1577900861.0,"No, it's not wrong to not want to be someone else, or not be yourself, but it is possible that he had many things going on you did not know about. Nobody knows the entirety of what I go through, I just let little bits and pieces out when I get too stressed. I've changed drastically over the last couple years, I would say I wear two faces, one for public view, and one when I'm alone. If John hadn't died, I probably would not have changed like I have, and even though I feel immense guilt over it, and I think I've become a much better person, I'm not sure I should change. I know if given the chance, I would bring him back, but I would feel awful about going back to who I was, so I can understand your dilemma. Don't blame yourself, we all make mistakes, we all have regrets, I've made enough mistakes in my life to fill a landfill. It is my duty to try to do kind actions until the day I can empty that landfill."

AskReddit,fcrcldf,t1_fcpv10q,1577900016.0,"The easiest way to handle this would be to tell her you recently discovered you have a crush on her, and you wanted to know if maybe she reciprocated the feelings, if she doesn't, you don't want it to hurt your friendship, but you were just curious. Plenty of people can get touchy-feely with other people, I've had friends that I could sit there and put my hands on their legs, backs, or just about anywhere without them being uncomfortable. She might not have been flirting, just being nice, this is a tricky situation though, because of how long you've known her, how might she acts towards other people she's interested in, there are many factors I cannot account for. But I would say the best course of action is to just tell her you have a crush on her."
