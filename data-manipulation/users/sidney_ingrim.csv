Unity3D,fdjc8hb,t1_fdjbqwe,1578464996.0,"When you’re older, but you would have a decent portfolio to help jumpstart your career by then if you keep on brushing up your skills and making prototypes and small games."
wholesomememes,fd013w0,t1_fcyez0g,1578112062.0,"It’s good that you’ve opened up to your close friends. Don’t worry too much about burning them out. I’m sure they’d want to do the best they can to support you. But do let them know you need help taking the first step to getting better - getting professional help.

As for family, I totally understand. It can be difficult to open up for fear of burdening/worrying them. But on the flip side, maybe sharing your troubles can start a healthy and safe environment with your family to share and support each other. I think if you don’t feel like going into detail about your feelings, at least give them a rough overview of what you’re going through, so they know how you’re holding up.

Lastly, keep people in your life, stay in contact regularly. Sometimes you might feel like shutting yourself in. Try to avoid that as it can create an echo chamber that amplifies your negative thoughts."
wholesomememes,fcyd5fw,t1_fcybakw,1578078354.0,"It won’t be easy, but I imagine it’d be like pulling out a thorn in your side. It’ll hurt a whole lot when you yank it out, but once you do it’ll get better. And you deserve better. 

Start small I guess. Let your problems be known to the people closest to you - family, close friends, loved ones, etc. Don’t be afraid to express yourself and be honest about how you feel. If you can’t get yourself a counselor, tell that person that you need help. I’m sure they’ll do everything that they can to get you the help you need."
wholesomememes,fcy8hfg,t1_fcxxi1o,1578076294.0,"Not really an expert, but yeah, if it can’t be cured at least managing it would be a huge step forward, I think.

You’re not alone. I think self-hatred is a common symptom to have amongst sufferers. But don’t hold off on seeking out help at all.

I agree, the first step is the hardest. But I believe once you’ve taken that first step, you’ve nowhere else to go but up. Stay strong and pull through. You got this!

If you don’t know where to start looking, I think you can start by letting a family member or close friend know that you’re having depression and get their help in finding the right professional.

Most importantly, don’t lose hope!"

tifu,fcvtzdh,t1_fcuozom,1578010058.0,"Well, we were together for 10 years and we were very close, so it’s been difficult and painful but I’m slowly trying to move on. I know she wouldn’t have wanted me to be sad. Thanks for asking."
tifu,fctml34,t1_fctloul,1577949057.0,Thank you. I appreciate the support in this difficult time.
tifu,fctmi3u,t1_fctjyo8,1577948952.0,"I did. She spoke to me about her problems, but I made the mistake of focusing on trying to fix her problems instead of supporting her emotionally.

I did suggest therapy to her but she was insistent that a therapist wouldn’t be able to help her get better. I didn’t press further because I was afraid she might do something drastic.

I think another big part of it is how lonely she was. We actually broke up (mutually) two months ago because of some complicated circumstances (we maintained on very good terms, though). She moved out and rented an apartment alone. One her first night staying there, she called me, crying, and told me how lonely it was. I think staying alone amplified the negative thoughts she had as she spent a lot of time echoing them within those four walls. I made sure to meet her at least once a week and communicated with her as much as I could through IM. But it was not enough. I think she needed someone to be there physically to support her.

It still feels so surreal. One day you’re just having a conversation with her and the next, you have a thousand words that you can no longer tell her. Even though we broke up, I never stopped loving her and I didn’t get to tell her that before she passed."
tifu,fctlt4l,t1_fctidsc,1577948101.0,"Thank you for your kindness. It may not help the pain directly, but I appreciate the support nonetheless."
tifu,fcthtmm,t3_eingyf,1577943760.0,"To anyone reading this who is struggling with depression, please please please find help. Speak to others, find a therapist and don’t deny that you have a problem.

My girlfriend took her own life last week. Her passing has been a shock and it’s terribly painful to everyone she knew, especially her family, my family and me. I can’t begin to imagine how scared and alone she must have felt when she did it.

Please don’t be afraid to seek help. You’re not weak, crazy, or pathetic for asking for a hand. Some problems you can’t just deal with yourself, and that’s okay."
Barotrauma,fc9e7hz,t1_fc9bohz,1577551318.0,"Can’t say that I do. But I guess I may just not have noticed it. Thanks for clarifying, though. It’s probably just a map generation bug. I also just read up on critical depths and apparently your sub’s speed is also a factor in how fast your sub walls take damage. Something to keep in mind for future runs."
Barotrauma,fc9b767,t1_fc98zak,1577549972.0,"Hey, thanks for replying to this old post again. :)

I see. That would be a bug then, right? I couldn’t find any wiki articles or anything talking about this as a game mechanic."
