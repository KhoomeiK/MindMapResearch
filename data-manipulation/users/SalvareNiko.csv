mildlyinteresting,ffe6lf7,t1_ffe5uja,1579838068.0,Yeah most of us make around 15 to 20 an hour. But our budget is high enough that we could honestly cut back on the dumbshit and give everyone a %50 raise.
mildlyinteresting,ffe5k6e,t1_ffe2907,1579837274.0,Having had to request said budget bump is a fucking ass pain and will likely end up denied and when issues arise due to lack if funds it's on you. Or if it is approved the lack of funds is on you regardless of the circumstances. Which ja why just last year our break room gotta 75 in tv and a massage chair as well as some very nice recliner sofas. I had a but over 15k to burn and nothing to use it on.
CrappyDesign,ffdybzo,t1_ffcihgb,1579831970.0,Yes but legally on these trucks a stack would be required on the exhaust to be directed downward. This model actually come with a stack but it's not in place here.
CrappyDesign,ffdy8gf,t1_ffd0a4d,1579831899.0,On this model it uses a vertical stack that would be attached at that point.
CrappyDesign,ffdy6jr,t1_ffdtdmg,1579831861.0,"Removing a cat increase engine performance and efficiency as well as life span of the engine. They generate alot of back pressure and kill power and increase wear. On diesels removing the DEF and EGR systems does they same. Diesel engine get checked out and operate like shit and with a much shorter life span with these components installed. However they release alot more Nox and particulate matter without them. 

As a diesel mechanic I am split about these components they are good for the environment based on emissions but with the increased repair cycles I wonder how much that plays a factor. Removing these components is referred to as deleting and you can see the effect in performance instantly and with repair cycles you will see it by your next oil change. If you where to pull the engine apart its fat cleaner and other components are not getting gummed up and destroyed."
CrappyDesign,ffdxefs,t1_ffdb35q,1579831302.0,On this model of truck they have a stack. That is the exact point where the base of the stack would be connecting with sleeve and clamps.  It was removed or broken and no replaced.
CrappyDesign,ffdxbpy,t1_ffce58c,1579831248.0,It's missing the stack. That's right where the bottom end of the stacks exhaust pipe would sit. So most likely it was broke. And removed and not replaced.
CrappyDesign,ffdx86w,t1_ffds2s4,1579831178.0,Well at that point in the exhaust jets just a sleeve and a clamp. If it broke off it wouldn't have damaged that part of the exhaust much if at all.
CrappyDesign,ffdx284,t1_ffdh36p,1579831061.0,Not so much altered as poorly maintained. The stack would have a pipe at the bottom that slide over or inside and clamps into place. They are easy to change but very expensive if needing a new one. Most likely the mount points where giving so it either fell or was torn off.
