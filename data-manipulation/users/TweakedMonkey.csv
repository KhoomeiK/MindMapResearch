OopsDidntMeanTo,ffgrut0,t1_ffgpiky,1579913458.0,So wrong. Take my upvote ya fool.
tifu,fffadds,t1_fff5kkj,1579879586.0,"With small children in the house, I suggest carrying a leaf blower at all times to power through small painful objects."
tifu,fffa4ne,t1_ffep6s4,1579879428.0,This is a BIG deal! 42-DD here and just tried this. Holy smokes it freaking works.
WTF,ffe97jq,t1_ffe6due,1579840173.0,"Yes, they are very similar that's what made my radar ping when you talked about it. I'm in watchful waiting but it is transitioning to multiple myeloma. I can feel it in my bones! (Ha,a little snarky humor there.) I go in a few weeks for my blood work. Seriously though, I've got other comorbidities that are far more painful and insidious then this cancer. Best wishes to you for a good outcome."
PoliticalHumor,ffe6odd,t3_et45jk,1579838130.0,Gosh he got a makeover!
CrappyDesign,ffe6ewr,t3_et4ci0,1579837929.0,Literally-a crappy design.
EarthPorn,ffe5bs3,t1_ffe3h0f,1579837097.0,Thank you. Look forward to seeing it!
EarthPorn,ffe2fpj,t1_ffe22g6,1579834946.0,Someday if I live long enough I shall experience the bounty that is Alberta. (And maybe a side trip to Calgary which is on on my bucket list) And you weren't rude I was being snarky. ;-)
WTF,ffe28p3,t1_ffdvkma,1579834803.0,"People don't ignore the symptoms in most cases. They call into work sick and are told they will be fired if they don't show up, or more likely they are living at the edge of poverty and can't afford to take unpaid time off. Many people do not have the luxury of staying home while they are sick and companies give no fucks about your illness. I say this both anecdotally and from personal experience. When I began to show symptoms from my cancer the billion dollar a year company I worked for made every effort to shove me out the door. Believe me, I think it's horrendous that this happens in this country but it does and will continue unless our business ethics take a wide turn and at least act like they care."
WTF,ffe1jyb,t1_ffdt7vp,1579834299.0,"And you likely were given the title of ""manager"" so they don't have to give you overtime? I hope you feel better soon-you needed to rest and capitalism won yet again."
WTF,ffe1bcx,t1_ffdoq23,1579834130.0,Waldenstroms perchance?
EarthPorn,ffe0xcs,t1_ffdsbv0,1579833845.0,Basically.
EarthPorn,ffdqapk,t3_et1d57,1579826379.0,Lovely picture. And here I thought Alberta was all Hutterites and flatland.
WTF,ffdpynm,t1_ffdpr6w,1579826167.0,"You are a very fortunate employee, and in a select minority."
WTF,ffdhef1,t1_ffdef49,1579820913.0,"I'm sorry you don't feel well, and if you work in the US you're fucked. Companies think that it's better to not pay you and encourage you to come in and infect everyone else. Absolute greed."
WTF,ffd579d,t1_ffd2rr1,1579813647.0,People take off of work when they're sick? Imagine that.
AskReddit,ffd4ibo,t3_esyx1r,1579813259.0,Dogs. Nothing else.
