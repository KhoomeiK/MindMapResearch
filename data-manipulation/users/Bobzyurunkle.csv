They spend billions on people and technology and fancy trucks and computers to track my package at every turn and somehow when I'm expecting something to arrive and it doesn't, I have to call them to tell them otherwise.

If I didn't have a seasoned and extremely helpful UPS driver on my route to coach me on what to say and who to ask for, all I would get from UPS customer service is to file a claim instead of looking for and tracking down my lost package.

Sure there are minor fender benders that happen. Mirrors taken off or the like.

Good luck with that."
toronto,feoeyzz,t1_feobi63,1579299164.0,">Maybe racing massive fire trucks around the city to respond to emergencies that don’t require a truckload of equipment isn’t the safest way to help people.

You understand that fire trucks are multi-use vehicles. Ladders, hoses, jaws of life, ropes, etc. You don't really get to pick and choose the fire truck that goes to a certain call. There are more pumper trucks placed around the city so they are generally sent to more medical calls. That's THE BASIC minimum truck you get in the TFS.

>Maybe street planners should stop designing roads to cater to the needs of large fire trucks, and instead make them safe for children.

Yes, city planners are ignoring street safety and those of kids to make wide roads for fire trucks. Forget garbage trucks, utility trucks, delivery trucks etc. Wow

>It’s not impossible: Smaller first responder vehicles. Narrower streets. Islands for crosswalks. Tighter corner radii. This is a design failure.

Ok, smaller trucks with less hose, shorter ladders, less life saving equipment so they have to send more just to have nice tiny vehicles.

To save you looking it up, the short of it is this is that all major cities in north america with full time firefighters on staff have to follow minimum standards. The NFPA standards dictate how many stations are within a certain area are dependent on density, population etc. This will minimize response times and lessen loss of life and property.

The standard also dictates how many firefighters are to be on a single truck and the amount of trucks on duty at a certain time.

There is much more but I would hope you get the idea."

toronto,fen93sj,t3_eq2bt4,1579279653.0,"Emergency services workers driving with lights and sirens still have to adhere to the HTA but with exceptions.

Until we get details of this we don't know what happened for the girl to be in the path of a fire truck with lights ans sirens. She was in a crosswalk, that's it. The charge might indicate that the fire truck driver saw a car stopped at the crosswalk and assumed it was for the fire truck and not knowing the young girl was crossing. Emergency vehicles with activated lights and sirens are allowed to run red lights and stop signs but only when they come to a full stop and proceed when it's safe to do so. I don't know what the law is around crosswalks but at the end of the day, if he didn't yield to caution, that's how the charge comes about. 

I'm sure the FF is crushed over this but it seems as though he may not have done what he was supposed to in regards to using his lights and sirens and not seeing the girl. 

Those emergency responders with partners or someone in the passenger seat have the benefit of a 2nd set of eyes which can help. The captain on a fire truck occupies the passenger seat and is usually that set of eyes. However, they are also watching their onboard computer for maps, updates to the call enroute, etc and can't always see everything.

I think the situation is taken into context when something like this happens and the courts lay down a ruling. Tunnel vision, adrenaline, speed and more. I wouldn't want to see this hurt the career of a 22 year veteran. It's not malicious or likely even careless as the charge states.

It's for the drum AND cymbal noise. Cymbal crashes and their frequency tends to overpower vocals and their levels.

toronto,fddqsvs,t3_ekotzq,1578321524.0,"My Mr. T moment happened early 80's in Etobicoke of all places. He was filming something at night around the corner from my house on Islington Ave. just north of Lakeshore. We saw the movie trucks and my Dad took me over to watch the whole thing and kind of stood off to the side to stay out of the way when Mr. T appears out of nowhere and ducks past my Dad and I into a small laneway and asks us to block him while he drops his pants and puts on some bandages on his knees. He was friendly as was had our backs to him and made small talk. 

I'm 49 now and this happened early 80's and I still tell the story to this day. He was larger than life to kids in the day and I got the shield him while he dropped his drawers for like 4 minutes. No autograph, no pictures. Just an odd story."
aww,fcvirno,t3_ej4zv4,1578002968.0,Looks like a scene from my wife coming home drunk from a girls' night out and wanting some. You pull her hair just a little and she freaks out!

Detroit firefighters work for shit money, use shit equipment and overworked due to limited resources. Now some will lose their jobs because of this. Shameful"
toronto,fcvguzc,t1_fcv3hec,1578001817.0,"Thanks for that, very entertaining. Goes to show you the poor attitude of a business owner trickles down to the staff.

I vowed to stop going because of the poor service and the quality of food going downhill. Was only ever good for their breakfasts but for some reason they were always understaffed and only ever gave excuses for the poor service.

I tried ordering a baked potato with my meal at dinner time. The teenage waiter said I couldn't. I said it was on the menu and he said I can't order a baked potato on the side until 5pm. It was 4:45pm.  He wouldn't budge, so we left. 

Sorry so many lost  their jobs but sadly it's the sign of the times now. Rent increase or not, it wasn't delivering the quality it was known for so many years ago."

Knowing she was ready is how I hope I have to send my little one off when it's time. Doing it more for her comfort is way better for everyone.

Happy 16th Chloe, and happy cake day OP!!! Sad way to celebrate it but a great way to remember Chloe. 

Good luck to you in your time of healing."
