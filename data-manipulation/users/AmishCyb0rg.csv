If a corporate product or service causes loss harm or damage to someone, it's extremely difficult to actually go after the individuals in the corporation.  Sure, the corporation can be sued into bankruptcy, but the legal structure of it almost always protects the people inside the corporation from legal responsibility for their actions.  Add another legal fiction to the equation (a trust), and it's that much harder to hold people accountable for their actions."

MandelaEffect,fe13rw1,t3_enjvq7,1578822215.0,"Every few months, I check the prices of precious metals.  The last time being early September last year when I also bought a palladium ring.  I recall the price of palladium being about three quarters that of gold and platinum being about a third more than gold.

Two days ago, my father mentioned something about gold being more valuable than platinum and I incorrectly disagreed with him since I have never seen gold's price higher than platinum's.  However, upon checking historic charts, it appears the spot price of gold has been higher than platinum since about 2014 and palladium surpassed gold in value around last September.

I'm wondering if anyone else recalls platinum always being more valuable than gold.  I was so sure of it that I had to check the spot prices one more time before sending this message.
