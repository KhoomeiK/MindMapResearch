amazonecho,ff8wh97,t1_ff83oar,1579698375.0,My Ring Doorbell does this (effectively) for my cat. I have a motion detector zone set up and everytime he walks up to the door it makes a sound. I answer = happy cat. Don't know if it would work with your dogs. my cat never comes near the door unless he wants in.
ADHD,ff8r60h,t1_ff8qriy,1579692739.0,No not really. This mania/euphoria lasts 7 to 10 days and then is followed by depression for the same length of time. It sucks. :-/

ADHD,ff6hees,t1_ff6gh4n,1579627250.0,"Thanks so much. (My adhd means I’m more than likely about to misinterpret your comment. I’m sorry in advance I don’t mean to).

I don’t really have a duality on/off meds as I’m never off my adhd meds. I’m prescribed a very high dose due to my strong symptoms. 

The duality I described in my post has always been with me but getting worse with age. Vyvanse seems to have just put it into sharp focus.

Vyvanse is great for quietening my noisy brain. I wouldn’t want to stop it as it helps control my adhd a lot. Is that a risk if I spoke to my doctor? Honestly,  I think vyvanse has made “hypomania” a bit more hyper but I’d rather have something like lithium added to my script than vyvanse taken away. I’d still need something to keep my adhd under control?

I seem to be “cycling” every 10 days. Today is day 2 of depression and I’m having all sorts of  dark thoughts but I’m coping :-)"
