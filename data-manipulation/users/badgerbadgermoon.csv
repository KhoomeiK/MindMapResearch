BipolarReddit,ff560ez,t1_ff4n3mq,1579581215.0,This happened to my best friend in college. She might be bipolar as well (?) but it got much better once she got her Hashimoto’s treated.
JustNoSO,fetj84j,t3_eqj76p,1579376010.0,"One time my ex blamed me for blowing a tire and having to get a hotel room because he was DRUNK DRIVING and I wouldn’t let him stay with me. 

For the record, he was already my ex and he had plans to stay with a friend, we just happened to see each other out and about one night. He assumed I would let him stay at my house and kept trying to force ME to go home because he was ready to leave. No, sir. I’m an adult and I came out to be out as long as I wanted. Call your friend, dickhole. 

That was the straw that turned him from being a friendly ex to being blocked/NC."
JustNoSO,fem28v6,t3_eptzkm,1579237371.0,"I’m so happy to hear that you’re safe. I have been following your story since Christmas and  I feel that I speak for many of us when I say that I was getting increasingly worried as your husband seemed to get more and more out of control. I’m glad you took an escort. 

I know it’s not how you were raised, and I know you made a lot of promises to not only each other but to yourself.  I know facing these failures is so unspeakably painful, but they’re not your failures. It’s time to let them go and accept that life doesn’t go as planned. This is something that happens to everyone—no adult is the same person as they were when they were 18 because of this. Growing is painful. Don’t take it out on yourself. Please do not believe that it is a moral failing. You are so strong and brave! 

Just because it’s normal to have disappointing and painful experiences, doesn’t mean how he’s treating you is normal. I have seen you downplay a lot of his behavior since the beginning, but it’s obvious that deep down you know you’re not being treated lovingly. Your husband is scary. No matter what his internal circumstances are, you’re not going to be able to fix him. Only he can do that. Being disappointed is normal and healthy! Being sad is normal and healthy! But finding reasons to pity him or believing that he can change is just putting you in danger. Run, don’t walk away. 

Regardless of his motivations, he used you as a tool to get away from his mother. That is obvious. And he abused you. Honesty some other commenters have made compelling arguments about the possibility of him cheating—the Google maps thing was weird. This guy has some major projection issues. 

Do not believe that it’s your fault that your marriage ended. It’s absolutely appalling to hear this, how ready he was to erase you. That’s someone who honestly never planned to put in any of the work in the first place, and now that you stood up to him he has no use for you. If you plan on going back for stuff (again when he’s not there and with an escort) try to snap photos of the letter you wrote to him and pics of the way he arranged the home so he can’t try to come after you with some kind of bullshit charge of abandonment in the divorce (idk what this would actually be, laws vary state to state, it’s just better to be armed with info!)

I am normally so, so against telling people what to do. I know my opinion doesn’t count for much but I have a terrible TERRIBLE feeling about this guy. Please do not waste any more time on trying to fix this relationship. He isn’t the guy you thought you married, and if there’s any saving him it won’t be you, and you shouldn’t try to achieve that at the expense of your safety and self-esteem.  You have given him plenty of opportunity to fix things, and you’ve seen the ways he has tried to lovebomb and rugsweep. Please stay strong. You deserve so much better than this psycho."
