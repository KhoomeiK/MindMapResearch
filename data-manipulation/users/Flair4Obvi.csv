After reading more of your inputs (thanks, really), it sounds like there is big trauma going on for people who’ve been pushed out economically, and I understand you dislike visitors and tourists, and if anyone like me had their sights on Bend as a place to live, then I must be part of the problem. 


I’m truly sorry for what you’ve endured, and the changes you’ve had to make in your life and needing to relocate your families out of necessity. Thanks for sharing your story, I hope it gets better for you.


The people who posted replies I thought were helpful or nice were actually just being sarcastic? Guess I’m slow on the uptake. I’d still rather look like a naive fool than actually be bitter and jaded about fellow humans.


There’s a lot of energy coming at me about how things are so bad they’re beyond repair. 


I’m hoping the in person experience of the town is less bitter. But if it is, at least I can believe in the honesty of that and can make an informed decision not to move somewhere things are so terrible.


(Or maybe I still will, and be part of the solution)."

I’m not a perma-positive person, but I want to be, because that gives me more energy and hope so I can be effective and live a good life and contribute to the world around me. I’ll seek the company of those who are as good as I want to be, help others who want to be on my current level and beyond.

enfj,ff1hsb4,t3_er2hxo,1579479438.0,"Yes, totally plausible. I used to get annoyed reading INFJ sub reddit because there is an active denial of any bad traits, and reframing them as positives, e.g., them thinking they have ultimate power to obliterate other people who have hurt them, a very harmful way of thinking...
And then I realized... ENFJ SUB HAS THAT SAME TYPE OF DENIAL THING TOO! 

In my experience as a strong Fe user, who was in a ltr with an INTJ for 7 years, I know *I* repressed feelings because I thought that was how you kept peace. I thought he was a robot, with no heart (at times), and I went through feelings of martyrdom, but we always talked through things eventually and that’s why it worked out as long as it did.

Idk if you are an ENFJ or are with one, or another with strong Fe. But for relating to yourself and others, just try and slowly eek out the feelings, acknowledge them, take responsibility for them, you’ll learn  if you haven’t already that no one else can “make you feel” any certain feeling, that you are responsible. 

On the other hand, don’t let any Fe dom hold you hostage to their feelings in a relationship unless you are SURE that they’re worth it to you. It takes a long time for bad habits to break. And you will go through some very low lows."

What would you propose happens to the cruise ship? Or to the passengers/customers?

Edit: leaving my original message up bc I guess I need to get better at communicating if I’m ever going to help there be peace. When I talked about an individual cancer cell, I meant it like one person has the power to effect a big change — for the positive or negative.

I see a lot of blame directed at “companies” or “corporations” and it minimizes human power to effect change. 

I wasn’t disagreeing that cruise ships pollute. I wanted to know what you would suggest be done. You said decommission them (or someone did, too many comments to separate it all).

When you evolve and surpass them, they’ll talk about how you think you’re better than everybody. - It’s possible that they already think you’re better than them in some way to begin with.

But the main point is, when you get in the habit of evolving on a daily basis, and growing, then you have this positive internal pressure where you won’t be so easily kicked in by the words of others.

Working for myself has been the best, since letting my employee go.

Having no one above or beneath you is the best right now. When I was at my previous company, the boss would never come in, and that set a bad tone for work as the onus was on me to ensure everything got done. The employees were lazy, and were the type of people to say “Yeah, I got it. I said I GOT IT!!!” And then do it wrong, because they just didn’t like protocols.

On one hand, I took responsibility for that, thinking it meant I wasn’t effective in explaining it... but there’s only so much of that you can put on yourself if people don’t meet you halfway.

enfj,fdrh03n,t1_fdqqnb3,1578684441.0,"Same :) 

And due to Fe, I find myself wanting to defend this preemptively.

I also know that defensiveness is a main cause of disunity among people with differing political views. 

Mostly because of the people I love having different views, and the realization that I differ from them causes meltdowns.

And I would rather just make my honest opinion with my vote, anonymously, and keep peace with people I meet so we can actually keep relative peace and make progress without squabbling."
offmychest,fdqryp6,t3_eml4h2,1578673602.0,"I’m so sorry for this experience. You seem like someone seeking to understand the kids and your feelings about this awful event, and I feel for you and for them. I’ve had a brother attempt to commit suicide, and even though that was many years ago, I still get a hole in my stomach if I don’t hear from him for a while.

From an outside observer (no kids), I think a few things contribute to kids being inexplicably sad, maybe a sadness they can’t even articulate to themselves. Probably true for adults too.

Don’t know if the following apply to this kid. But here goes:

- Time spent indoors, lack of sunshine, fresh air, access to nature, and lack of movement/play (specifically outside).

-Normal parental arguing, and not being able to understand why it’s happening.

-Feelings of incompetence at school or a sport or something else important to their life. 

-Boredom, tying into first point.

-Humiliation in some way.

-Loneliness. Not always apparent on the surface, and being misunderstood can compound loneliness.

The last three points as factors in why people don’t succeed in school (but also these have stuck with me in looking at why people have problems in life) were drilled in by Art Pearl, a professor of civic engagement at U of Oregon. 

Just my two cents."
unpopularopinion,fdonj9s,t3_em8dai,1578608780.0,"I put an ad blocking software on my Nana’s laptop, and it’s really helped! 😊
It seems that the Olds don’t want to remember when you tell them not to click on some shiny pop up, so you have to just block them from seeing it.

Side note, Reddit wanted to auto correct my perfectly spelled “ad blocking” to “AS LOCKING.”

It just tried to do it again above...

NO."
offmychest,fdo2wyh,t1_fdnf0m5,1578597909.0,"Right? They have this attitude of, “Aww come on!! I need to get my rocks off somehow.”

What, as like a reward for somehow clinging to life as long as you have? 

GROSS."
CBD,fdmc3wi,t3_em25mr,1578545218.0,"You mentioned your tense muscles in your neck are interfering with your sleep.

I will put CBD topically on pain areas, and leave the area bare for 20-30 mins for it to absorb. It usually works well at killing pain in target areas, so you might try that on your neck and traps.

Hopefully that can help release the tension so you can sleep. Another thing I like is yoga tuneup balls though unrelated to CBD these are great for releasing tension in pain points like neck.

If you’re taking it orally, be careful of taking too big a dose. Sometimes that can backfire and leave you feeling more wired.

Also, sometimes CBD edibles are better for knocking you out. I like these CBD gummies bears my mom gets but can’t remember the brand, sorry."
offmychest,fdlpbb9,t3_elxt3x,1578529273.0,"Anybody ever taken care of elderly people? 
I was a caregiver for 5 months a few years back for an elderly couple. 
She was wheelchair bound, he was very unsteady on his feet, and a big dude, who would routinely “forget” to use his walker, so I had to come stabilize him so he wouldn’t fall. 
I happened to be caring for them on my birthday, I mentioned it was my birthday (it’s why you shouldnt tell near-strangers your bday). The guy had to wear these edema compression boots that zipped up the leg and lie in bed for 20 mins twice a day.
After I’d removed his boots and helped him stand up, he grabbed my shoulders, pulling me toward him to give me a “birthday kiss” because I was “so nice.” 

He had surprising old man strength, but I managed to get out of his arms without having to get his kiss.

I made sure I was never in a room alone where his wife was too far away from us the rest of my short time there.

Still weirds me out. 

It’s also what I envisioned when I heard that sound bite about Donald Trump “just have to start kissing a beautiful woman when I see one.”

Never trust a “sweet old man” and don’t be too nice to them either."
cbdmarketing,fdlitbv,t3_e1ykx3,1578524957.0,"This is helpful! Thank you!

I’m in the beginning stages of building a website where I’ll show people products I use that have helped me health wise, one of which is CBD oil.

I wondered if offering a PDF as a sign up “gift” that included various aff links to CBD and other things I use would violate FB restrictions? So it would go:
FB Ad->Lead in page->Optin page where they receive my PDF on my health protocol-> once they opt in, I send them to the PDF with aff links, hosted on my site.

What do you think of that idea?"
AskMen,fdk5n1e,t3_elrao6,1578496618.0,"I think parents cultivating appreciation and normalization of natural bodies is a good thing, unless there is any kind of creepy intention going along with that. 

Disclosure: I don’t have kids. But, I think that parents can passively show their kids what real bodies look like, and show their kids that they are comfortable in their own skin, even as they age, and then the kids will learn to appreciate and have compassion for their own bodies.

If your son doesn’t get an idea of how a real woman’s body looks (or a man’s) but from his parents- where else will he learn this? From porn? From his own experiences much later on as a teen/young adult? 

Seeing his parents bodies at the later stages of adulthood may give a healthy point of reference, and improve his view of himself and of women."
