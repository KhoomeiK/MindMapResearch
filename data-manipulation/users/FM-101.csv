AskReddit,fggpgvd,t3_ey5tm0,1580766707.0,"This may sound stupid but im going to say video games. Please hear me out.

I have been a huge video game fan my whole life, ever since i was a kid in the early 90s. I watched game quality get progressively better year after year. Developers seemed passionate about making cool new games. Nowadays everyone just wants to get in on the mobile micro-transaction market because that's where the real money is. And it shows. 

It started some time around 2005-ish with small things. Extra digital in-game purchasable cosmetic options. No big deal ""dont buy it if you dont want it"" etc.   
Except every year it got worse. Its almost like companies competed to push the boundaries of what sort of nonsense they could get away with.   
Day 1 DLCs. Permanent paid early access. $99 Ultra deluxe super edition. Microtransactions. Pay to play the beta. Lootboxes. $2.50 horse armor. The list goes on.

Quality has gone down across the board. Dumbed down game mechanics and lazy content that game starved people will buy because they dont have any other options (with exceptions existing like for example Witcher 3).   
I cant help but feel like part of this stems from the fact that game companies dont *have* to make quality products anymore since they still earn money from all the extra crap that whales keep buying. And why are microtransactions and all this stuff so popular? Because everyone and their grandmother are playing cash store roulette simulators disguised as ""games"" on their phone.

Video games becoming popular kinda ruined gaming for me. Im sorry for ranting but this is something im passionate about and it pains me to see young gamers growing up thinking this sort of thing is normal, and not knowing how amazing Valve used to be. 

Thanks for reading."
