ChoosingBeggars,ffni3tz,t1_ffm8pxb,1580066203.0,It said that’s what family is supposed to do. Are you related?
iamverysmart,ffnhd5v,t1_fflqz1i,1580065996.0,"Bruh the whole thing feels like hieroglyphics to me, tbh. Like you can tell me what it means and I’ll believe you. And remember it and be able to repeat it to you. But every time I see it, I’m like “what secrets are you hiding???”"
toptalent,ffl9b49,t3_etyhsi,1580036699.0,Ah the reverse flagpole!

iamverysmart,ffi2fdg,t3_etkh69,1579963097.0,Ugh I’m in my last year of med school. And lemme tell you. Glycolysis and I do NOT get along. My brain just finds it so nonsensical. I mean I understand the concept and what happens when certain processes are interfered with and how different metabolic states affect glycolysis pathways. But like fuck. I could never memorize the cycle. And I’ve been trying to learn that shit since high school. So don’t feel bad at all!

Its clear she didn’t appreciate all you did for her. But I also think you’re overreacting about the Insta post. It implies the vacation was paradise but that she just missed her man. I’m sure there are things about her that irked you. Especially if she acted so bored the whole time. And even if she was an angel, it doesn’t mean she’s always entitled to free trips"

JUSTNOMIL,ffezgib,t1_ffeul1y,1579871328.0,She didn’t actually think that though. She just wanted to make a scene out of jealousy
niceguys,ffe0mf3,t1_ffdxgyn,1579833623.0,"I mean I know that people that have ethnic hair and maintain dreads can keep them so they don’t smell and get really gross. But at the end of the day, as I understand them, it’s basically matted hair. Which you acquire by infrequent washing. Inherently, they have to be a LITTLE dirty. But also, I’ve just seen wayyy too many folk that go for dreads for the trend and just don’t understand the upkeep and end up with smelly tangles of hair."
niceguys,ffdrzy8,t1_ffdl5f6,1579827477.0,"Tbh, I dislike dreads in general. There are plenty of people they look good on. But I'm pretty grossed out by the concept in general. Unless I'm understanding it wrong."
awfuleyebrows,ffdq0h4,t1_ffdp4a3,1579826199.0,"Not that I know of. But I only see her like 5-10 mins at a time. So I really wouldn't know. But if someone has, it hasn't affected her in any way whatsoever. She's been rockin the look for almost a year now (that I know of). 

But you know, in some levels I admire the lady. She HAS to know that poeple are staring at her weird. And some old patients or really disoriented patients have no filter, they'll say what they're thinking before they know they're thinking it. So there's little to no chance that she hasn't heard something about this in the year that I've been at this hospital. And I admire the confidence it takes to do what you want regardless of what other people think. (As long as its not hurting others)."

AmItheAsshole,ffa4fwd,t3_esd1z8,1579727683.0,"NTA for thinking it. Probably not what someone wanted to hear when they're day dreaming about the perfect babies they're about to have. But its a good reality to hear. 

Definitely please don't tell your kids this though. Like at any age."
awfuleyebrows,ff9o327,t1_ff9m4so,1579717040.0,"Dude, I know. Whenever I'm on a team that where she's the nurse of my patients, I cringe thinking about a patient that had a heart attack or stroke or something or just in general doesn't really know what's going on yet. And then wakes up to that face standing over them injecting meds into their IV. It must freak them out a bit lol. But everyone is super polite, and nobody has said anything to her yet. She's a decent looking lady! And her skin is velvety smooth, it is also black. Her foundation and eyebrows are NOT....These 2 must be friends. Because I cant imagine 2 completely separate people coming up with this look independently."
BadMUAs,ff9l1qq,t3_es7j95,1579715246.0,"Honestly, the eyes can be a real look if everything else was decent. Sadly, that is not the case here."
whiteknighting,ff9kyim,t3_ese9md,1579715193.0,"I can't tell if this is whiteknighting and saying ""you should never argue with women because they're always right"" 

OR 

if this is a dig at women saying ""you shouldn't argue with women when basically anything because they can't handle a rational conversation"" type thing."
awfuleyebrows,ff9ilos,t3_esdhlh,1579713794.0,"Omg theres a nurse I work with that does these EXACT eyebrows and eyes. But then to make it worse, she couples it with a GENEROUS layer of foundation that is about 6 shades too light for her"
AmItheAsshole,ff7l1lm,t3_es0mxj,1579652080.0,Honestly this is the best way to handle disgusting comments like this. NTA
insanepeoplefacebook,ff7ihyq,t1_ff7i483,1579650336.0,That’s such a strange thing to want to be right about. Like that can’t even be proven. Such a weird concept.

sadcringe,ff5x039,t1_ff5ejmz,1579613056.0,"I’m pretty sure this is an old story. If so, I know the story. The 71 yr old last isn’t the mom. She’s the grandma. She was just a surrogate for her daughter, whose body couldn’t handle pregnancy. I forgot why. But yah.

I feel like that could turn into a sexual harassment case real quick. 

So for my own sanity, I choose to believe these people don’t exist."
