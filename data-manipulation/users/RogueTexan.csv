AskReddit,ffe8rh5,t1_ffd44le,1579839805.0,"I was thinking of adopting a new kitten after my 19 year old feline best friend passed away. I always loved solid grey cats and was thinking of getting a male grey kitten, but said, ""Maybe after Portland,"" since we were going on vacation in Oregon soon. When we got back home, I started looking through a local animal rescue organization's adoptable pets, and there he was. The male grey kitten I had been imagining was listed directly after a cat named Portland."

I don't understand all the love for Anfisa. 100% manipulative and abusive. ""But Jorge knew what he was getting into, so he deserves it!"" Fuck off, no one deserves to be treated like that with such ridiculous expectations. I respect her for getting her shit together and not depending on a man, but people like her never change."
