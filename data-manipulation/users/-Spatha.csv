The songs were originally meant to be played as one song but they broke it up into three.  Disposition and Reflection will help you wallow, then Triad helps you vent it all out.

science,fbr1diy,t3_ee4p1m,1577037976.0,"This is true.  I trained MMA full time for about 5-6 years after high school.  I remember only having right handed orthodox fighters to train with at my gym.  My second MMA fight was against a south paw.  Everything felt so off that fight.  I couldn't use my jab like I normally did because his right hand was right there ready to parry.  South paws will always have the advantage simply because there are more right handed fighters for them to practice against.  It doesn't work the other way around because south paws are somewhat rare.  I've even seen right handed guys switch to south paw only to try and gain the advantage.
