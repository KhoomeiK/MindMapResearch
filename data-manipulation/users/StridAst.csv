EosinophilicE,ffcejxh,t3_esqwto,1579797764.0,I sooooooo feel this picture.  My dietary restrictions have totally made me withdraw from a lot of social interactions.  And I was never particularly social to begin with.
mastcelldisease,ffced1r,t3_eskpz5,1579797644.0,"My information in non experiential (I have no tattoos) but gleaned from both my sister's experience, she was formally diagnosed with MCAS as well back in November, and from others in MCAS groups.
My sister's tats are points where she is most likely to itch or get hives around.  This is a fairly common experience.  

Mast cells are normally involved in would healing, and tattoos are effectively a broad skin wound as far as your body is concerned.  So it's pretty common for it to gain a larger concentration of mast cells than the surrounding skin.  (The same thing happens with scars).  This doesn't really mean the tattoos cause the itching or hives, it's more that it provides a focal point.  So consider the location before you get the tattoo.  If you get one in a spot that would be more embarrassing to scratch on a semi regular basis, it's something to consider.  

My brother is lucky.  He still got EDS, but no signs of MCAS.  He has tats all across his back and is now working on the chest, no problems whatsoever with any of them.  I envy him."
EosinophilicE,ffccowh,t1_ffbfx3o,1579796605.0,"We have an increased risk of other eosinophilic disorders, this included.  However we also have increased risk of all forms of allergic disease, and the symptoms are pretty similar to other allergic diseases.  As a general rule, it's advised to get a CBC (complete blood count) once per year if you have EoE.  This among other things, gets a count of your eosinophils.  The normal range is 0-500.  So OPs at 3 times the *max* normal range!  Just to put things in perspective.   If you show an elevated blood eosinophil count on a CBC, then you up the CBCs to twice yearly.   Talk to your primary care physician if you haven't had one recently and request it.  It's a pretty simple and routine blood test.

Keep in mind, regular run of the mill allergies, or even mast cell disorders can cause pretty much the same symptoms, and both are more likely with EoE than hypereosinophilic syndrome.  With regular allergies being the most likely, then mast cell disorders, then hypereosinophilic syndrome being a low, but nonzero probability.  

Mast cell disorders is something I'd *strongly* advise *against* you looking into if you're a hypochondriac, as they can cause so many possible symptoms that it's like the cliche of someone looking at WebMD and then thinking they have cancer.  The exception to this is if you have a pattern of reacting to odd things like sunlight, or temperature (heat or cold) or stress (physical or emotional), or exercise, pressure, vibration, odors, or other weird atypical things.   Or if you are above average in flexibility (A Beighton Score of 4 or higher).

I do have a mast cell disorder (MCAS) and get chronic itching from it, along with anaphylaxis from stress, but my blood eosinophil counts continue to hang out between 475-550.  So often slightly elevated, enough that my PCP has me get twice yearly CBCs but not enough to cause the itching.  That's firmly caused by my MCAS.   

So yeah, blood eos should get routine counts for us, but unless they are significantly elevated, it's nothing to worry about.  Anything above 1000 eos on a CBC is something to worry about.  1500 + symptoms which OP listed is a definite ""do something about"" situation, not just a worry about situation.  Eosinophil counts between 700-1000 would warrant quarterly testing instead of twice yearly testing, but still wouldn't be something to be extremely concerned about.   Just to give some ballpark ranges my doctor mentioned to me when I was concerned at 550 eosinophils on a CBC."
EosinophilicE,ffaxzcv,t1_ffapdvs,1579747094.0,"EoE doesn't directly cause itchiness.  At least as far as we know.  However, EoE is almost never found by itself.  Allergies, or mast cell disorders are both potential EoE comorbid disorders that can cause itchy skin.   Mast cell disorders typically cause a lot more than just itchy skin though.  Lots of random symptoms, that can often appear unrelated.  New allergies can of course develop and cause itchy skin, even when the trigger foods were previously safe. Etc.

Eosinophils themselves don't release histamine (the chemical that causes the itchy sensation). However they interact with both mast cells and basophils which do release histamine, [and there is a mast cell component to EoE](https://journals.lww.com/ajg/Abstract/publishahead/Mast_Cell_Infiltration_Is_Associated_With.99454.aspx?fbclid=IwAR0dpn1ZIeAg2FOc0xUcQSm0lmBcWUDjc5l1GWEx6Xkzb2CQNCRjtLupQsI) However, as mast cells are non circulating, if EoE directly caused itching, you would expect it to be in close proximity to the esophagus.

EosinophilicE,ff9mexw,t1_ff3vlx8,1579716048.0,"Mast Cell stabilizers definitely help my EoE symptoms.  However I have a full fledged mast cell disorder (MCAS) comorbid with my EoE.  

Sorry, I've got nothing to share for the paper that doesn't hit a paywall.  The paper establishes quite firmly that mast cells are directly involved with symptoms even when eosinophil counts drop, however it makes no claims upon treatments.  It's research to establish that yes, there is more than one effector cell in EoE, and it builds upon and confirms [prior research that establishes the link between mast cells and eosinophils in EoE.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2902643/?fbclid=IwAR3reX7myVmr1Mlw20rZ_HNlndbpiNbn--9SsiBouVKa-vlbZjcLlTq7vgU#__ffn_sectitle)

It's up to future research to establish treatment options to reflect the change in our understanding of the pathology of EoE.  As I said before, I notice a huge difference in my EoE symptoms with treating my MCAS, but then, I do have MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome) in addition to EoE.  

My allergist has me on Zyrtec twice daily, Pepcid A.C. twice daily, montelukast nightly, Quercetin twice daily, and vitamin D3 supplements as needed to keep levels up (low vitamin D actually destabilizes mast cells.  It's not a mast cell stabilizer, you just can't let the levels get low or it makes things much worse.  So taking extra doesn't help).  I used to be on cromolyn sodium, which helped my EoE more than the quercetin does. However I had to switch insurance plans, and I've been fighting with the insurance to get them to pay for cromolyn.  They don't like to cover anything MCAS related, and cromolyn isn't an officially recognized treatment for EoE.  (There was one *very* small study on it's use in EoE with mixed results, that failed to determine a drop in eosinophil counts, but noticed a drop in symptoms, but not more than placebo.  However it's a n=16 study.  So beyond small.)."
EosinophilicE,fewmk2g,t1_fevjo6a,1579414753.0,"That would depend on the efficacy of those drugs.  The siglec 8 receptor that Allakos is trialing a targeted drug for, supposedly stabilizes mast cells and induces apoptosis (self destruct) in activated eosinophils.   Which in theory would reduce/destroy most of the eosinophils and reduce the amount of mast cell degranulation (the releasing of the ""attack chemicals."")  However the company Allakos is being investigated for securities fraud, (stock market manipulation).  Which means they might not be quite on the level when they self report on the efficacy of how their drug is doing in phase 2 clinical trials.  Time will tell on that one.  *If* their drug is safe, and behaves as advertised, it would likely be more effective than steroids at reducing symptoms and mitigating further esophageal damage.  

Dupilumab is already out, and I'll let you Google that one, as there's plenty of information available.   Future similarly targeted drugs might be more effective than Dupilumab already is, which could improve things further beyond what's already available with it.  Between the two drug pathways, we might not be able to get complete elimination of symptoms, but if not, we'll likely get much much closer to that than we are now."
EosinophilicE,fes9lqw,t1_fepxjjo,1579362928.0,"In a way yes.  This builds upon previous research that has documented the relationship between eosinophils and mast cells in EoE.  The two cell types normally work together when attacking, so it makes sense.  This new research is essentially documenting that the elevated mast cell counts persist afterwards (which confirms previous research) and that they contribute to the symptoms in a meaningful way.  (Suspected but wasn't known for sure previously)

As neither the mast cells nor the eosinophils are actually mediating EoE (that's Th2 cells) think of it as a way to describe the relationship is the mast cells are heavy bombers, surrounded by a large number of highly mobile attack fighters (the eosinophils) all commanded and controlled by the central command (Th2 cells).  We've previously focused on the eosinophils as there's so many that we assumed they did all the damage.  Now we have established that there are two types of cells attacking.  

Which suggests we focus research on drugs that interrupts things at the Th2 cell level like Dupilumab, or we focus on drugs that target receptors on both eosinophils *and* mast cells such as siglec 8 receptor agonists (AK002 from Allakos is the only such drug in trials). Or perhaps both.

EosinophilicE,feowu3g,t3_eq925n,1579307115.0,"The TL;DR is while eosinophil counts can be reduced, mast cell counts stay elevated, and mast cells remain an effector cell in EoE.  Eos are the primary effector cell, mast cells are a secondary cell.  Both however release the mediators that cause inflammation and damage.  So removing the eosinophils only helps with part of the problem."

EosinophilicE,fen95cv,t1_fen52cz,1579279679.0,"Xolair (Omalizumab) is also a monoclonal antibody.  Yet it has many known side effects.  The possible side effects of which include cancer and cardiovascular problems. (Only mentioning it, as it's been around longer and do is better documented.) The company listed above, regarding the drug I was previously excited for (AK002 from Allakos) is [now being investigated for securities fraud.](https://apnews.com/4c34974fa08f4a6e92fab9e53c80e6bb) So it's hard to know how much information to actually trust when it comes from the drug companies themselves, who routinely get investigated for falsifying information in many forms.   

Dupilumab has known side effects, one that illustrates the unknown is a patient with hair loss started regrowing hair.  Yes, it was a positive outcome.  However the point is, it's *not* known how this occurred, because it shouldn't have happened.   This doesn't mean you shouldn't consider it, just understand that there is a lot we still don't yet know.  Make a decision that is as informed as possible.  Most of the side effects of Dupilumab involve the risk of reacting to it.  It's pretty much exclusively used in patients who are atopic, and all of us atopic cases are at increased risk of reacting to things.  Not a real surprise there. 

The biggest *known* risk of Dupilumab is keratitis, which can lead to blindness *if ignored.*  Meaning, if you get on it, and you start having real eye issues, take them seriously and get into your doctor.  Discontinuing the dupilumab would stop the progression and protect your eyesight.  Ignoring it could cause all kinds of serious eye issues up to and including cornea ulcers. (Enough said?)  But again, you'd have to try stubborning through eye problems for *many* days to weeks to get to that point.   So pretty much, if your eyes start getting issues, make an immediate appointment and everything's cool.

I'm stressing the risks, because yes, they are real.  They do happen to people.  Overall PPIs are much better understood and safer.

EosinophilicE,fen3sfg,t1_fen1r30,1579276337.0,"I'd try the PPI route first.  It's pretty much the first thing to do is establish if your EoE is PPI responsive or not.  It's around 40-45% of EoE cases are, and while it would help the other inflammatory conditions as you surmised, it's *much* cheaper and more available.  While there are potential side effects with long term PPI use, at least we know what these are.  Dupilumab hasn't been around long enough to have a clear idea as to it's potential long term risks.  So ""the devil you know"" and all that.

That being said, if your EoE doesn't respond to PPIs (keep in mind 55-60% of cases do not), then discontinue them and definitely go for the dupilumab.  Either way, talk to your doctor first.  As while PPIs are available OTC, having things properly monitored is essential.

Even if the body *could* form an IgE antibody against it, such an antibody couldn't propagate through the body without binding to the water inside the body itself.   The body has free water throughout it, in a constant state of being used, reused, bound, unbound, etc.  These processes aren't perfect, sometimes the body accidentally makes hydrogen peroxide instead of water when unbinding (H2O2) but then the enzyme catalase in our blood breaks that back down into free water and O2 again.  (As one example of the rather complex water cycle within the body.)   Such a hypothetical antibody would result in perpetual unrelenting neverending reaction that couldn't be stopped and wouldn't matter what the patient ate or drank, as a glass of water is a small amount compared to the amount of molecular water already free and available inside the body already.

Also the news articles claim the patient can consume milk and other drinks which still contain free water.  Which wouldn't be the case for an IgE mediated reaction."
FoodAllergies,fedw2nu,t3_eokld4,1579021108.0,"A bit of info.  There's more than one possible break in the various processes that produce allergic reactions.  Others have elaborated on Aquagenic Urticaria and hives already.  I'll go into the difference between allergies and mast cell disorders. 

In allergies, the problem is the body is producing antibodies against harmless proteins.  These antibodies are called immunoglobulin E.  Usually shortened to ""IgE."" When the antibodies meet the proteins they are build to fit with, they lock together and this clump signals Mast Cells, Basophils, and Eosinophils to release various chemical ""mediators""  such as Histamine, Cytokines, Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and more.  These chemicals cause the actual symptoms.  The signaling happens because these cells have receptors for IgE antibodies.  These IgE receptors are kind of like ""on switches."" 

In IgE mediated allergies, these cells are just doing their jobs like they are supposed to.  The problem is in the body making IgE antibodies to harmless things in the first place.

IgE allergies are pretty straight forward.  Eat the trigger, get the symptoms.  It's pretty regular and predictable.

IgE antibodies can be checked via simple blood tests to identify if they are present.

---------

With mast cell disorders such as MCAS or Mastocytosis, the problem seems to lie directly with the mast cells themselves.  They start releasing these same chemical mediators without IgE involvement.

With the more rare Mastocytosis, there are known genetic mutations to the mast cells identified.  It's possible that there are mutations to mast cells with MCAS as well, but studies are still ongoing to look for these.  Until we know more, we won't know why the mast cells are releasing these chemicals without IgE, just that they do.  In mastocytosis however, visible clumps of mast cells are often seen, so it's believed that the body is making too many mast cells (though the clumps are not required for diagnosis under internationally accepted criteria.)

As this isn't regulated by antibodies, it's possible to react to things you can't actually produce antibodies to.  Things that you can't make antibodies to, like stress (physical or emotional), heat, cold, vibration, exercise, sunlight, pressure, weather changes, can be triggers, (on switches).   In addition to the more common triggers like food, pollen, mold, etc.  Reactions can also be unpredictable, with reactions occuring with exposure on one day, but not on another, making it a lot more chaotic and hard to figure out.

Now with mast cell disorders a common symptom (out of dozens of possible symptoms) is ""third spacing."". It's where the body is shunting water to places where it can't be readily used.  The abdominal cavity is a common spot, as is angioedema  (think the under skin swelling seen in allergies as well).  As this process actually dehydrates the body, there are limits to the amount of water the body can shunt.  But as dehydration sets in, the patient gets thirsty, and begins to consume more water or other fluids, allowing the third spacing to continue.  As the swelling from the third soacing applies pressure and the pressure stresses multiple organs, (see above pressure as a potential trigger) further exacerbating a reaction, it's very much possible for a reaction once started to progress all the way up to anaphylaxis with drinking more water.  

Was it the initial trigger?  No, in this situation a reaction had to already be well underway beforehand.  It's just the straw that's breaking the camel's back.  However it's very much possible for this to cause someone to believe water is causing them to go into anaphylaxis.  *Provided they actually have such a medical disorder in the first place*.  

Once someone with such a disorder believes that water will hurt them, stressing about drinking water alone could potentially induce anaphylaxis.  Emotional stress on it's own may be sufficient to induce anaphylaxis in some patients.   I have no idea if any of this is what's going on with anyone in any ""news"" articles.  I'm simply playing devil's advocate and listing a plausible pathway to achieve such a result.  Personally, I suspect the person in the news article of just being an attention seeker.  However it's rather hard to have an objective opinion on the matter when someone keeps trolling with the topic regularly here.  Your post doesn't fit the usual M.O. of the troll though, so I figured I'd give a serious answer."

Allergies,fe9d6wv,t3_eo6fhw,1578936503.0,"IgE blood tests are less accurate than skin prick testing.  Both should be utilized in conjunction with a history of reactions to verify the results as well.  

IgE blood tests don't have a specific threshold as to what indicates an allergy.  Think of the results as more of indicating the probability of an allergy rather than a clear cut yes or no.

It's possible to react below a 1, and possible to have no evidence of reactions at 8.  But in general, the odds of passing a good challenge (eating a piece of suspected allergen and monitoring to see if a reaction occurs) are close to 50/50 at 2.  Personally, I react to soy, which tests at 1.18 (last test) just as much as I react to peanuts (3.5ish) or chickpeas (4.2ish)

It's important to know that these numbers change over time and with exposure.  If you eat shrimp or almonds, those IgE antibodies they are testing for bind to the protein in the almonds as part of the reaction process.  This ""uses them up"" so the counts drop until your body has time to make more.  So getting tested on different days can yield different numbers.  Particularly if you ate shrimp or almonds close in time to one of the tests. 

I'd suggest getting a second opinion from a different allergist.  0.39 is *very* low.  As in barely above the clinical threshold.  It's a nonzero chance for it to be significant, but not a high chance either. 

Even then, all if this is only relevant for IgE mediated reactions, (classical allergies.)  There are other pathways for the allergic processes to be triggered.

False positives and false negatives are always possible as well. etc.  Which all boils down to ""reactions trump tests."""

Allergy,fcw7be9,t3_ej3nd7,1578018799.0,"The allergic response is upstream of the nerve involvement. 

In classical allergies, the issue is that the body identified harmless proteins as invaders and produces antibodies against them.  Specifically immunoglobulin E also known as IgE antibodies.  

When these antibodies encounter the proteins they are built to target, they trigger granulocytes (mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils) via the IgE receptors on these cells to release Histamine, prostaglandins, cytokines, leukotrienes, and various proteases that cause the symptoms.  These various chemicals can interact with nerves.  Histamine stimulates the itching via the H1 receptors (it also affects gastric acid production via H2 receptors, then there's H3, H4 receptors, AND it functions as a neurotransmitter as well).  

But all of that is after the Histamine and other chemicals are already released.  Meaning, after the allergic response has been started.  Nerve damage can interfere with transmitting the itching signal to the brain, but it won't prevent the allergic response in the first place, as all those chemical mediators are already released before the nerves are even involved, and not all of the response is even interacting with your central nervous system directly."

The U.S. government also provides humanitarian aid, healthcare benefits, food stamps, and a wealth of help to people who need it.  This does *not* preclude U.S. government politicians, including those who vote for these policies, from being corrupt. 

I'm most familiar with the religion in which I was raised, and so I can not speak to the numbers regarding other religions.  But with Mormonism, they provide 40 million a year in aid.  Which is great, but it's also a drop in the bucket compared to what they bring in with tax free donations.  They spent considerably more than that lobbying and advertising against prop 2 (medical marijuana).  When the bill passed in Utah, they sat down with their politicians behind closed doors and got them to gut the bill.  

Largely because leaked documents list the Mormon church has invested heavily in pharmaceutical stocks. They have no moral issues with the opioid epidemic, but oh no, not medical marijuana!

They spent more than 40 million campaigning against every single gay rights bill that came along in the western U.S.  from prop 8 in California, to bills they campaigned for, like the one that banned same sex marriage in Utah (which was struck down by a federal judge).  

In short, of the estimated $5 *billion* in annual revenue, the Mormon church spends only $40 million on charity work.  Enough to maintain the facade that they help people, while the majority is used to push the political agendas, build new sources of revenue like the $1 billion City Creek mall they constructed in downtown Salt Lake City, buying property for new church buildings, and paying the salaries of those who run the church.  (They require the local leadership to serve unpaid, while the upper ranks, the ""general authorities"" get six figure salaries from the church).  Leftover money goes into their investment portfolio.  

They've been recently outted as having stockpiled $100 billion.  Yet still, that annual $40 million expenditure keeps chugging along for charity work.  Yes it helps some, but it's mostly just a footnote under their advertising budget.   Help a few, be seen doing it, so people look at that, rather than what you do behind the scene in the political arena.  They also openly support candidates [despite the government prohibition against non-profit organizations doing so](https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/political-campaign-activities-risks-tax-exempt-status) engage in misinformation campaigns on social media and on Wikipedia.
