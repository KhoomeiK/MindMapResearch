todayilearned,ffy1mg8,t1_ffy0om7,1580336779.0,"Apart from the Almanac itself, I guess. I posted it because I thought it was about an amazing woman who was mostly forgotten by history. She is important because she did something special that had an impact on the world and maritime navigation. If you want to go down that road, there were other maritime chronometers developed at approximately the same time, independent of Harrison. Why not consider him irrelevent to history if it would have been done anyway?"
todayilearned,ffxzqgy,t1_ffxz2gb,1580335650.0,"Really? Please, do name those who can do high-level maths with no formal education at all.

And she was special, as she completed a full half of the first Almanac by herself, as one of three computers, the other two of which were men. She did achieve a remarkable and special thing, but because she's a woman she's being diminished even now. Just look at this thread!"
todayilearned,ffxzbfl,t1_ffx395l,1580335399.0,"I really wasn't expecting to have to argue this point, or the fact that dates are a thing that matter? Harrison did a great thing with clocks, but the best clock in the world doesn't do anything if it's not used until decades later."

todayilearned,ffxyvgc,t1_ffx3x5l,1580335134.0,"Way to ignore that fact that the almanac was around for at least 50 years before maritime timepieces became widespread. Or that the almanac is the reason for Greenwhich being the Prime Meridian. The clock wasn't invented by Harrison, just a more accurate (and much more expensive) version for use at sea."
todayilearned,ffxymez,t1_ffxpu7c,1580334990.0,"I just read a rather interesting chapter in \*Rage Inside the Machine\* about women in these scientific fields. They were pushed aside, ignored, or even vilified if they managed to do anything at all."
todayilearned,ffxy60d,t1_ffx1hgm,1580334729.0,"Actually, there are several sources. Also being able to do complicated mathematical computations with no formal training, or education at all, is exceptional. Not to mention being able to do so in a time when women were firmly second-class."

Everyone else seems to be making the point that because he made a clock, Mary Edwards's contribution to maritime travel was small and unimportant anyway. This is fundamentally untrue. Here is one such source describing navigation in the 18th and 19th centuries that says lunar distances, via these tables, were used for more than a century due to the expense of chronometers.

todayilearned,ffwcnpd,t1_ffwcd20,1580295527.0,Yes I know. People have been pointing it out relentlessly. There was between 40 and 100 years in which these tables were used before timepieces were widespread or even available. It doesn’t invalidate the magnitude of the work she did
todayilearned,ffw83ga,t1_ffw4w35,1580288871.0,"Firstly, I'm a woman trying to give a little light to a forgotten female mathematician that was never given any credit or consideration. Secondly, nothing I've said is false? I'm not arguing against Harrison, but there's no serious claim that the Almanac was never used or wasn't used widely for some time."
todayilearned,ffw7xza,t1_ffw7vn1,1580288640.0,It was still in early alpha stage in the 1700's :)
todayilearned,ffw6u0r,t1_ffw4r3h,1580287050.0,"...and his clock was not widely adopted and available for another 120 years. Indeed, he didn't create a clock that was accurate enough to be used until 1759 with the 'Jefferys' watch. But it still doesn't matter if the watches were too expensive to be used widely, and indeed they weren't used at all until 1772. and not widely until the mid 19th century. 

That first clock was a prototype. It was never a viable source of navigation for any ship bar the one it was tested on."
todayilearned,ffw6s76,t1_ffw53r4,1580286980.0,"I am not using my 'own' facts. You are merely using irrelevant ones. Harrison's first clock was not completed in 1730 but in 1735 and was only a prototype, which is irrelevant, as is the fact that that it performed worse than the lunar method. It is also irrelevant that he completed a more accurate clock in 1759, even though it was not used until 1772 for Captain Cook's voyages.

All of that is irrelevant as the timepiece was too expensive to be adopted quickly, and wasn't widespread until the middle of the 19th century. Which, as you might gather, is some time after the completion of the Almanac and much longer than the creation of Harrison's first clock, which was never used on anything more than a test run.

todayilearned,ffw4h88,t1_ffw3me8,1580283938.0,"As said in another comment, there was almost a full century between the publishing of her work and the large-scale adoption of a reliable timepiece at sea. That's like saying Morse shouldn't have bothered with the telegraph since radio was just around the corner."
todayilearned,ffw4b8r,t1_ffw3jnj,1580283725.0,"Prodigies are not only 'gifted children' and it is special when she had no formal training or education in anything resembling mathematics. And she was one of 35 over the course of her lifetime. For the first editions, she completed 50% of the calculations herself, with the remainder performed by two men.

As for Harrison, the Almanac was published first in 1767 and nautical clocks did not become commonplace until 1800-1850, by which they had mostly replaced lunar tables. That is a not-insignificant portion of time and indeed contained much of the expansion of the Empire."
todayilearned,ffw3ikg,t1_ffw29yu,1580282736.0,"No, she's mostly been forgotten. The Naval Academy forced her daughter out, who Mary had trained to continue the work, because they didn't accept women as employees. She did get a minor planet named after her, but mostly she was lost to history. A lot of female 'calculators' were; there was a movie about the NASA women a couple years ago I think."

aspergirls,ffgi3rv,t1_ffgh2hp,1579906744.0,"Yeah, I have it above my desk. So the thing is that I want to be doing something productive towards my goals instead of just 'idling' and browsing reddit or whatever. So with the timer, it's a constant reminder to stay on track and do something good. Phone goes ding, then I go 'what am I doing right now? Is it constructive? Should I be doing something else?' If the answer is no or yes, then I open the bullet journal and find something on my weekly list of goals/jobs.

Maybe I have down do some art, read a book, do some writing, or do the housework I've been putting off. I just pick one from that list, whatever I most feel like doing (which might be nothing, but I still pick from the list). Next ding from the phone, if I'm still on that task then great. If I finished, move onto the next one. That way I'm always trying to be productive and on task.

Some days I don't look at the bullet journal at all that much because I know what tasks I want to do and am motivated, but those days are few and far between.

Short term though, like through the day, what I like to do is set gentle timers on my iPhone for every half hour or so. It’s keeps me from losing track of time and keeps me more mindful of what I’m doing. When I combine it with daily tasks in the bullet journal it can work but the pressure can make me anxious, so usually I just refer to the weekly spread. Mapping out my day hour by hour is just distressing when the timetable inevitably breaks so I’ve kind of made a mix of systems."
