Boise,ffyvqwc,t3_evvj07,1580356356.0,The mental health care here is way under funded and not equipt to do what they need. We also still have a huge stigma surrounding mental health still. Especially in the rural areas.
DunderMifflin,ffw9krk,t3_ev91yj,1580291085.0,I watched this episode today!
Boise,ffvs3jt,t1_ffvrigc,1580271673.0,"You're entitled to your beliefs. I've been raped....more than once. I can tell you from experience, and also from the first hand experiences of other victims, that the last thing your traumatized brain wants to do is face your attacker. It's incredibly difficult. Just because the rape wasn't a violent one doesn't make it any less valid. Victim blaming and people not believing them is a huge problem in this world."

Boise,ffvdk3a,t1_ffvbwpl,1580261600.0,"Oh, I'm not saying don't mourn. He did good things too. He wasn't evil, he just did a horrible, disgusting thing. If we mourn him we need to remember the whole person. And the fact that he's a sports icon makes it that much more important to point those things out."
Boise,ffv9e97,t3_evbraf,1580258801.0,The dude was a rapist.
