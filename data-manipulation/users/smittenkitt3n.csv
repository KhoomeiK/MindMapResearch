HumansBeingBros,ffgu16i,t1_ffg9s82,1579915046.0,"that’s interesting! maybe you feel less anxious because looking out the window makes you feel like you’re more in control? 

i also fly quite a lot (college and family in 3 different states) and i *still* get anxious, so you’re not alone!"
HumansBeingBros,ffg4wn5,t1_fffyj3q,1579898529.0,"that’s so sweet of you to help her out with her flight anxiety! i have it as well, and it helps to do [grounding activities](https://www.healthline.com/health/grounding-techniques#mental-techniques) and keep the window shut so you don’t see the plane actually taking off or being in the air. i personally like to bring a videogame i really like and just get so focused & sucked into it that i forget that i’m on a plane. if she’s not into games, a coloring book or word puzzle or anything to keep her physically & mentally busy may help. everyone’s different when it comes to coping, but i hope this helps a little!"
AmItheAsshole,ff6nrwm,t1_ff6euwo,1579631131.0,try sorting by controversial :) that works for me!
AmItheAsshole,ff6ejj8,t1_ff61c3r,1579625474.0,you should filter by “asshole”. there are some good posts with that flair
AmItheAsshole,ff4ws7p,t1_ff4wfc1,1579574317.0,"hey girl you went through something heartbreaking, but reddit will always find a way to be toxic and unreasonable. i dont understand why everyone’s so focused on the cheating aspect, when the dress itself is the reason for the question. i think you should stop replying to these trolls. a lot of them come from toxic subreddits and you cant win with them— they’ll keep pushing and pushing. save yourself & your mental health the trouble :) sending you internet hugs"

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fel2ok3,t1_fekpyy0,1579212754.0,"idk why youre getting downvoted. it’s true— a lot of rescues are so uptight about their “prereqs” and act as if ANYONE with a job can’t take care of a dog. i’ve been told that i should have a backyard for my dog to run around in.... my pup just walks around the backyard, sniffs a few places, then comes back inside. i’ve lived in apartments with him and he’s been perfectly happy. 

i totally understand checking the house in this case, though, just because this person lives so far away and it might help their case (esp since theyre way more than capable of owning a husky based on their profile)"
BikiniBottomTwitter,fek54l8,t3_epjp6r,1579192808.0,there’s an option to thank the person giving you gold/silver via your inbox as soon as you get it.... not sure why they have to edit it directly into their comment. it’s obnoxious af

my hair would burn/itch like hell when i put too much bleach directly on my scalp but not when i put it on the hair directly, if that makes sense. i also have black hair, so it gets bleached a lot"

MadeMeSmile,fecd55w,t1_febedpg,1578971119.0,yeah i agree. some people don’t grow up fine *because* they were raised a certain way— they grew up fine *despite* being raised that way

AskReddit,fdrw2ef,t1_fdrhaz1,1578690622.0,"r/dogs and r/askvet swears by the bigger brands that have in-lab scientists who do food trials on the dogs. hill’s science diet, royal canin, purina pro, etc. my chiweenie is thriving on hill’s and he seems to like it! just stay away from boutique dog foods. it’s linked to dcm

but yeah def check out those subreddits! i spent many hours looking up dog food (unfortunately, most of those hours were spent on dogfoodadvisor, which was a waste of time. the dudge who runs that site is a frickin dentist)

nottheonion,fdped06,t1_fdparp3,1578626469.0,"my uncle is deaing with the VA right now. the process is hell. despite multiple doctors confirming that he has service-related injuries, he STILL has to go through so much shit to get the help he needs. that’s just the physical part. the mental part is worse— he has to retell the trauma he experienced in detail to confirm that he has ptsd (which is horrifying, even just based on the tidbit he told me)... AND he has to have people he knows (me included) write letters to prove that he experiences ptsd. they haven’t approved him yet and it’s been months.

oh, and he was in the army 30ish years ago... he gave up on the VA when he first got out cuz it was so shitty (and ptsd wasn’t really acknowledged then), but he’s finally doing this whole thing after his friend recently beckoned him to. he was self medicating with alcohol for a while. so... yeah. the va system is awful

i hope things are going better for you, though, dude. i’m not a fan of war or military spending, BUT i am grateful for people like you (and my uncle) who risk their whole wellbeing for civilians like me. thank you! sending you internet hugs"
