coolguides,ff7zzjk,t1_ff7vzff,1579662434.0,"Biology teacher here. You’re only half right. Your mother can only have blue eyes, because blue eyed people carry no dominant eye color genes. However, your parents having brown eyes does not mean they cannot carry a recessive gene. You could have a blue eyed recessive gene going back for generations, although each child has brown eyes. Brown eyed parents very often pass along blue eyed (or blonde haired) genes. 

I have brown eyes, as does my husband, my mom, my brother, and all of my kids. But my dad and my husbands grandpa have blue eyes. So all of my children could potentially have blue eyed kids because they could carry the recessive gene.  I could have also had a blue eyed kid, since both my husband and I carry the recessive gene."
