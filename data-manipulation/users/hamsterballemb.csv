Every court system in the country has ways to complain about a judge, and ways for a group of other judges and/or the public to fire a judge. This decision is not beyond review.

And contrary to this thread and the general attitude on Reddit, I don't even think you'd find the typical judge or citizen to agree that 179 days is just *plainly excessive* for attacking a chained defendant in a courthouse, no matter what the accused did."
PublicFreakout,fee9gk9,t1_fee5o02,1579029149.0,"You mean like this thread? 

Dude already went through the justice system. He's been tried, convicted, and sentenced. And his sentence was *significant*. The average time served for murder in a state prison is 13 years, the median minimum sentence for a second degree murder looks like only ~9 - 12 years, and his initial sentence here is 25 years. That's serious time.

But it's supposed to be basically ok to attack him in a courthouse...even after the system *did* work this time? You're gonna track him down while he's literally chained at the wrists and attack him, even though he's only *there* to be such an easy target precisely because he's already being punished?

There's comments all over this thread saying it's not enough, he's lucky it was only a punch, the uncle should face absolutely no consequences, don't worry this dirtbag will get raped in prison, etc. etc. Basically no one disapproves of this action (besides me apparently) or at least says ""the urge is totally understandable but I can't condone he actually did it""."

GoogleFi,fdp3zj1,t3_ekmhjc,1578619456.0,"I switched to T-Mobile and absolutely everything is better. It's more than worth another $10 per line to leave behind Fi's simply *incessant* technical issues. Even the customer service is better here, now that Fi basically gave up on customer service in 2018.

Even the data is clearly better. T-Mobile doesn't have great data coverage, but at least now I don't have availability related coverage drops *and* ""Fi is changing to Sprint now so Google can save money"" coverage drops.

There's also the huge number of people who report Fi aggressively tries to use Sprint if at all possible when in the United States. T-Mobile is, of course, almost always better than Sprint in a given spot. You're not actually getting the ""best network for your location"" or whatever their ads say, you're getting the cheapest network that works at all for your location. 

I spent three years on Fi before moving to T-Mobile this summer and there's not a single thing I don't like better about T-Mobile. The couple things that were once much better about Fi, like WiFi calling integration when you're out of cell range, are in fact *worse* than major providers now. I never get my text messages two hours later on TMobile or have to click airplane mode on and off to connect an outgoing call through WiFi or have to practically scream for people to hear me or randomly can't hear the other end for five seconds on T-Mobile; all of that never stopped happening on Fi, no matter what phones I tried. 

So my experience was bad. Even places like /r/ProjectFi, which is usually almost cult like in their sneering dismissal of any complaints about the service, have had times lately with huge numbers of people complaining about problems you'd expect no Fortune 500 company to *ever* let happen.
