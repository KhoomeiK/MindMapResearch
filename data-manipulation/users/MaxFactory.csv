antinatalism,fdf2nop,t1_fba813n,1578351918.0,"How can someone *so obviously biased* state that they can overcome their biases? 

You’re mom abused you, and now you think **all** parents are evil. Can you see the bias there? Either you can, which means you are aware of your bias but don’t do anything about it (in which case you do the same thing with advertisements) or you can’t even tell you are biased, the same way you can’t tell you are biased by ads. 

Now that I’ve read through your post history, it’s obvious that you don’t have much education. You are not more knowledgeable about psychology than a doctor of psychology. They have spent their *life* researching human psychology and determined that advertising in specific ways works. You have **no argument that advertising doesn’t work besides how you feel about it**, as opposed to someone **whose life work** is the study of the psychology of advertising. 

How arrogant do you have to be to believe your own perceived experience is more than enough to dispute decades of research by thousands of professionals? Jesus Christ."
ABoringDystopia,fdez7x7,t1_fdexgpi,1578349748.0,"You should write a paper, because there’s a good chance you could win the Nobel peace prize by explaining your process of neutralizing biases. You’re more knowledgeable than the entire collected works of every psychologist in human history, good job!"
ABoringDystopia,fdeogf2,t1_fdemj2j,1578343303.0,"Advertising works the same way, creating biases in your mind toward their product. As long as you are aware of a company, you are biased towards liking them more than a company you don’t know. All other things being equal, if you are hungry and see two identical restaurants, you are more likely to go to the one you’ve heard of before. This is the way all humans work, we like things that we have heard of more than things that are brand new to us. It gives us *just a little bit more information* about the decision we are about to make and that influences our decision. 

Unfortunately this sort of bias is just as hard to get rid of as other biases, and there are times where we are too tired, or not paying attention, and the bias steers us towards the products that have been advertised to us. It’s like breathing -  we can control it when thinking about it, and when we aren’t, our subconscious takes over for us."
ABoringDystopia,fdekk37,t1_fdeikqo,1578340988.0,"So it sounds like your argument is that while advertising has put thoughts in your head, it doesn’t factor into your decisions. 

I’m curious, do you have any biases? Or do you believe you are completely unbiased?"
ABoringDystopia,fdeif7t,t1_fde9ee7,1578339697.0,I feel like that just makes this boring dystopia even worse.
ABoringDystopia,fdeibco,t1_fde39vh,1578339632.0,"I’m surprised that the ground isn’t covered in ads. In the airport or subway station, essentially every surface is covered in ads besides the floor. I try not to look at ads when I can help it, and the only place I can look when walking around those places is my feet."
ABoringDystopia,fdei304,t1_fdeg4ga,1578339492.0,"Yes you are. Even hearing the same thing over and over will convince you subtly to buy that product. Not a commercial explaining *why* you should buy it, just the name of the product. If you go to the store to buy tires for the first time, having never paid attention to the content of tire commercials before because you never needed them, and you see two options (one of which you’ve heard of before, and the other unknown), you are more likely to buy the one you’ve heard of before. It’s a fact of human psychology. 

Can you think of *any* jingles from commercials? Maybe McDonald’s? Then advertising works. You might think you can master your brain to ignore what you’ve seen in ads and buy the thing that actually makes the most sense, but unfortunately it just doesn’t work that way. The advertising industry has teams of psychology PhDs using every trick they can to convince your subconscious to buy their product."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdecbhd,t1_fde45oa,1578335910.0,"OP posted the percentage with a degree of accuracy down to the *billionths* of a percentage. Frankly when the number is 27,000 you shouldn’t show any decimals, let alone to 1/1,000,000,000th of a percent. It adds nothing besides trying to seem more impressive."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdec48u,t1_fde3bkn,1578335785.0,"Why would you include so many digits after the . In you percentages? The 27,000% makes the 0.668763103% essentially meaningless. You either don’t understand significant digits or you are purposefully padding the percentages by showing them down the the 1/1,000,000,000 of a percent to seem more impressive."
todayilearned,fd6b4cl,t1_fd67h4h,1578188275.0,"I mean I’m not going to lie, it’s difficult. But man the emotion my wife and I felt when we saw our daughter for the first time... we were both so happy we cried. And we are not that kind of people! 

Two things that I now swear by are the book “Happiest Baby on the Block” and Taking Cara Babies (an online course about getting your baby to sleep through the night). Both were EXTREMELY helpful and if you are looking for resources check them out. 

Other helpful items are a sleep sack (which is like a zip up sleeping bag that constricts their movement when they sleep) and a sleep sheep (I think that’s what it’s called... it’s a stuffed sheep that plays white noise). The sleep sack is great because it’s easier than swaddling and won’t come apart as they move around. And the sleep sheep was so helpful we bought two. 

Good luck and remember: you can do it!"

todayilearned,fd39m3b,t1_fd2y949,1578156059.0,"Personally I have a 5 month old (our first) and it is DEFINITELY easier to work than watch my daughter. I love her and like spending time with her, but it is exhausting! Literally now my work weeks are the easy time and weekends are actually more exhausting. I’ve heard it gets easier when they can do more things on their own (right now she basically want to be carried around at all times and she weighs 20 pounds!)
