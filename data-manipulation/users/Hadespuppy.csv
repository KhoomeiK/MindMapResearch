AmItheAsshole,ffef7lb,t1_ffeaur6,1579845731.0,"My dude, I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Men care far and away more about dick size than women do. In my entire life (which has involved many frank conversations and events revolving around sex and relationships) I have never participated in or overheard a conversation about size that wasn't started by a man. Women. Don't. Care.
Your girlfriend is doing her job. I guarantee you, she isn't thinking about her clients in a sexual way, and she isn't comparing their dicks to yours or to anyone else's. She's looking for hair and removing it. That's it. You are not an asshole for having feelings, but you need to recognize that this is a you problem, and work on it yourself rather than trying to justify your insecurity."

relationship_advice,ff1x2cg,t1_ff1v8d4,1579488144.0,"It doesn't matter if they started their relationship before or after she was 18. He was her teacher. That automatically makes it a predatory relationship. He is a predator, and you remind him of thee good days when he had access to classrooms full of pretty young girls. Whether he did anything other than the once doesn't matter; his actions say he doesn't truly want to change."
relationships,feipse1,t3_epcxds,1579144193.0,"Drugs don't put words in your mouth. It sucks, but whatever you said had to have come from somewhere. Maybe it was something that you meant as a joke, but either way, it seems to have really bothered them. All you can do now is give them time and space, enjoy the friends who are still talking to  you, and maybe take a hard look at yourself to see what kinds of unintentional racism you might be harbouring. In my experience, the people who say they aren't racist the loudest are the worst for casual microagressions."

AmItheAsshole,fdl2ixw,t1_fdkypvh,1578515959.0,"If your first instinct upon hearing that a group of your colleagues are having a hard time is to get defensive and not to reflect on how your behaviour might be affecting them, and if there's anything you can do to help; then I can guarantee that you are part of the problem. Even if it's only that you are standing in the way of progress because you don't recognize the need for change.

Which would increase with efficient, accessible transit that allows people to move around their city more easily. And with a good transit system, cities would need less money for road upkeep, not to mention being more climate friendly. Seems like a win win to me."
HumansBeingBros,fcohow0,t1_fco84g0,1577832481.0,People using roads don't pay directly for those. And fines for driving and traffic offences are often far less than those for fare evasion. The benefits to the economy of an accessible transit system would most likely more than make up for the cost of maintaining it. It's a matter of priorities.
