Off the top of my head there's the sith admiral shouting to fire ion cannons... before the star destroyers fired turbo lasers. 

Also, why would they choose skywalker as a name when Rey had no connection to it. She was mainly trained by Leia Organa (Solo?), who's last name was synonymous with peace and democracy. Skywalker has a much bloodier history with little direct connection to Rey. Or she could have gone by Rey Skywalker Organa, IDK.

And, why bury the sabers on Tatooine? Leia never really spent time there and Luke absolutely hated the place.

I like fan service in films, but only if it was actually made by fans. This crap came off as made by someone that read an outline of the OT and decide to force moments into the movie.

This laziness is further felt when looking at ships in the last movie. The Xyston was literally the exact CG model as the ISD-1 in Rogue One with slight changes and the cannon. The ISD-1 is generally accepted to be a shitty ship, it can only fight other big ships... while the rebels mainly used fighters. That would have been fine if they weren't the only ship class being used.

The fleet at the end was also JUST reused assets, some of which were (in SW) unique ships or freighters. Imagine you tried to fight a naval engagement with an oil tanker.
