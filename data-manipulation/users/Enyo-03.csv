And getting treats while doing it? That is the best! Elli goes nuts when I grab the leash. If I don't move fast enough she goes and gets my shoes for me and drops them at my feet. Lol. It also creates a great training opportunity. Elli learned heel (by my side) follow (get behind me) lead (get in front) left and right through word commands while leash training on walks. But running, I've taught her hand signals to go with heel, lead and follow. Plus, every once in a while she looks back at me with that look, you know the one, that wide open mouth, tongue lolling, dopey grin they get that says ""I just love this"". And that always puts a smile on my face. So strap on those running shoes and get going! It will bond you two. Mal's, for all their work ethic and protective abilities, and how capable they are, at their simplest, they love their owners the most out of everything and she will love that time with you. 

And thank you. I put a lot into her, but she's so eager to learn and please me, I can't take all the credit. I love the bond we share and her antics make me laugh. Working with her takes a lot of time and energy, but it's also some of the funnest times I've had. She's my girl, even when she's being a dumbass, she's still my girl."
