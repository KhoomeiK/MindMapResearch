Not necessarily. It's a relatively new procedure, and we just don't have enough data to authoritatively prove either side. The data that is coming out seems to side with transition as a somewhat effective tool for alleviating suicidal tendencies.

It's also important to note that the dysphoria experienced is not the only factor. Perhaps equally important is social interactions such as bullying, acceptance or judgement, etc. Many trans people attempt suicide *before* transitioning for whatever reason, and I see these getting lumped into that horrible ""1 in x"" statistic trans-sceptics like to throw about."
