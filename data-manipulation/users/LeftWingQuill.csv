I make more than enough to provide for us, but we still forego luxuries, like new cars every few years or annual vacations. We are good. He makes money when his headspace is strong and cares for our home. He is also great to my parents and siblings, who know he is always available to help them out. His worth is not tied to how much he makes, and fortunately my income keeps us comfortable enough to stave off financial frustrations."
