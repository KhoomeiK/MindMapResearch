EntitledKarens,ffgv7db,t1_ffgufnq,1579915894.0,Personally I like to tell myself that all the Karen haircuts were practical jokes the hairdressers played on them that they were too stupid to notice.
aww,ffgusas,t1_ffg078m,1579915595.0,Even accepting that nature will be nature and hence often seems cruel to us... I've never encountered a magpie that wasn't being a mindless cunt. The ones in our garden frequently try to attack the other birds on the feeders even though the magpies are incapable of feeding from the feeders themselves so gain nothing from the endeavour... yet are happy to pick up the scraps the other birds drop from the feeders so would actively benefit if they let the others feed. They're just shit birds.
EntitledKarens,ffgu1o5,t1_ffgt0qp,1579915056.0,Yeah I would happily bet that this one haircut cost more than I spend on hair care/products (just shampoo basically) in several years. The amusing thing is I often meet women who are jealous of my hair and I really couldn't put less effort into caring for it if I tried...
aww,ffgthc2,t1_ffgrs17,1579914643.0,"I once spent 13 hours on a plane beside a morbidly obese woman who took up half my seat and literally smelt like unwashed vaginas (plural. It was that bad) and who only woke up whenever food showed up so I was stuck there the rest of the time.

At that moment I'd have happily traded to sit beside an entire pile of angry dogs who were all pissing on each other and trying to bite me...

If sitting next to a happy dog was an upgrade option I would pay for it."
EntitledKarens,ffgsavq,t3_eteocc,1579913781.0,I usually only wash my hair maybe every two weeks and cut it myself a couple times a year by literally just grabbing it behind my head and cutting off a handful. I've not been to a hairdresser in almost two decades and my hair still looks less retarded than this...
Peppers,ff4hgju,t3_erhmm6,1579563708.0,"Were these purchased at home depot or similar? Lot of shops like that sell things as reapers which are not and these do not look like reapers to me. So they're unlikely to be as hot as you expect.

Personally I would put them on a pizza... but then I would still do that with reapers anyway."
CombatFootage,ff4g64i,t1_ff4508x,1579562822.0,This is why I hate it when you see videos of self immolations where people put the person out. It's like the worst thing you could possibly do for them.

Some reverse image searching turned up a much higher quality image, looks to be the original.

RealLifeShinies,ff2iy1h,t1_ff29kxg,1579508203.0,Yeah I was there in Winter a few years back. Rather pleasant. Much like a typical British summer.
RealLifeShinies,ff1uca3,t1_ff1i2vd,1579486372.0,I love the little lizards you find all over Florida and the gators... but my enduring memory of Florida will always be the mosquitoes. Lesson learned: don't camp in the Everglades in September.
RealLifeShinies,ff1gvf4,t1_ff1c3qb,1579479021.0,Didn't know you had anything like that down there. I've been down the Keys and seen the iguanas all over the place so yeah... invasive species can get pretty crazy. Our parakeets are green too. We get them in the garden a lot. They are always loud and squabbling amongst themselves but they don't really seem to bother the other birds much so I don't think we'll have the same issues as grey squirrels caused. Though they are only really in the south of England at the moment so remains to be see what happens when they spread more.
RealLifeShinies,ff1bfp2,t1_ff18bar,1579477142.0,Only grey. The native red squirrels were wiped out by them. We also have parakeets from India and deer from China... it's all messed up around here.
RealLifeShinies,ff17puy,t1_few261l,1579476082.0,"I have never seen black ones in the UK, no. Only seen them in the US. I have heard of people seeing them in Scotland I think though. I've seen black ones in mainland Europe but I think they are a different species. They are much smaller and with tufty ears like red squirrels."
EntitledKarens,few24sq,t3_eqnayk,1579404423.0,I think autism stops you from talking to managers. It's a big problem.
RealLifeShinies,few1t3z,t1_few0vyw,1579404283.0,"Yeah I've always assumed it is something of a rare genetic trait. DC was the first time I saw white ones and they were clearly being harassed by the grey and black ones. To the point where they would steal food from them and chase them away. I figured because they were more visible to predators so posed a threat to all around.

Here in the UK grey squirrels (introduced from America) just always seem to be grey. I've never seen any kind of pigment diversity in them as I presume they all came from a small stock that lacked those traits. I didn't actually realise the kind of diversity you get in North American squirrels until I went out there because they are so uniform here.

Do you get a lot of snow there that might explain the white ones?"
RealLifeShinies,few0k4p,t1_fevjokq,1579403750.0,"Yeah not albino. This is basically the equivalent of a blond haired person vs a black haired person. Just genetic diversity. In the case of squirrels white may give them an advantage in areas that see a lot of snow as it hides them from predators. Or it could be a disadvantage in other areas as it may make them stand out more to birds of prey.

As far as I am aware grey, black, white or brown they are probably the same species so breeding between them shouldn't really be a problem. It's basically just evolution in the making. Whatever colour gives the best chance of survival should become dominant given enough time."
RealLifeShinies,fevz98w,t1_fest3ln,1579403347.0,"Yeah the white ones seem to be pretty common in some areas. In Washington DC I saw a lot of black ones and a few white (but not albino) ones. Meanwhile here in the UK, besides from the native red squirrels which the invasive/introduced greys pretty much destroyed almost everywhere I've never seen anything but grey coloured ones. I suspect the small population that started them here didn't contain the same sort of genetic diversity that leads to the black or white ones in the US.

Every black one I've seen in the US has been somewhat hyperactive and every white one has been bullied and attacked by grey and black ones alike. I guess because white makes them stand out to birds of prey so they are bad to have around for the safety of others. Maybe they'll get their time to shine if the area sees prolonged periods of snow?"
collapse,fevwxmd,t3_eqn6m7,1579402502.0,"'Work ethic' and 'career goals' are such tragic terms that people have been fed. It all comes back to this absurd notion that you have to be useful to society, work to fulfil that usefulness and if you work hard enough society will reward you. Meanwhile useless and unethical cunts at the top make more than you will make in hundreds of years by exploiting and fucking over everyone beneath them, regardless of the human cost. Where is their 'work ethic' and why is that presented as being more ethical than basic human decency?

Because it is all bullshit.

Myself, I couldn't care less about work ethic or career goals. To me the last few years I have spent devoting my free time to wandering around the local woods and fields learning about nature is far more valuable than some meaningless promotion. Yeah my bank account is virtually empty by comparison to these peoples' but the knowledge I have acquired about what I can or can't eat or use is far more valuable than money will ever be. I don't want to say that it will be fun to watch these people starve but I certainly will take pleasure from seeing the facade come crumbling down and watching that potential realisation set in."
