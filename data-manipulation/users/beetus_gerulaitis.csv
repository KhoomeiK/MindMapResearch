I grew up playing competitive junior tennis at the regional and national level, so I know all about self-destructive mind games and how mental state can help or hurt you.  Tennis is a very difficult sport mentally - especially for an adolescent.  There's no where to hide and no team mates to help you out when things aren't going your way.

You need to learn to train your brain to not focus on the results (winning / losing, setting a PR) or consequences (I'll be so proud, I'll be devastated, I'll be worthless) and focus on your breathing, being in the moment, and the joy in the activity.

Tempo and interval days are the same.  I count the warmup and cooldown (even between intervals) as easy.  Today is a 2 x 2.5 mile tempo day.  But I have a 2mi warmup and 2mi cooldown for a total of 9 miles.  I'll count the 4 EZ separately in my log.

Pfitzinger Faster Road Racing has a graph of 10k world records vs. age, and the curve is pretty flat up until about age 55-60, where it takes a sharp up turn.  Meaning you lose a little bit of performance starting in mid-to late- 30's, but the effect is a lot less than most people think.  It's not until you hit the 60's and 70's where performance really starts to degrade sharply.

Here's a similar [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/2mbag4/marathon_world_record_by_age_xpost_from/) that graphs world record marathon time vs. age.

Obviously, most people in their 40's and 50's have experienced much more of a decline than the graph would suggest.  But I think that's due to other factors - reduced effort, years of atrophy, lack of time for training, etc....not because age (through the 40's and 50's) imposes some huge penalty in and of itself."

running,fenj699,t1_felueub,1579285827.0,"You need to work on hips and glutes.  You have a very shallow and flat gait cycle - meaning you're basically swinging your legs forward and backwards.  It's a power shuffle with very little upward motion and very little flight time.  It also takes more energy to swing your leg forward straight than bent.

The ""perfect"" running form has you lifting your knees up to a 45 degree angle on the forward stride and extending on a nearly straight leg as you put weight on to it.  As you transfer weight through the gait cycle, your foot should (naturally) kick back and, as your quad muscle contracts, your heel should almost strike your butt.

This isn't just perfect because it looks right, it's also the most efficient way for a human being to run.

Like when you ask, "" Do most fast runners have a high VO2 Max right from the start? ""

VO2 max is not like eye color or detached ear lobes.  It's not a fixed genetic feature that you are born with.  It is a value that represents your current cardio-vascular fitness at a given moment in time.

You could be a cyclist, speed skater, or other athlete and be a ""non-runner"" and have a very high VO2 max.  That person will (with training) transition quickly to a fast runner.

But for everyone else, when you start running you have a relatively low VO2 max.  Then you train and your VO2 max increases.  While training, your leg strength and muscle endurance increases.

Kipchoge ran the marathon in 1:59:40.  That's a VO2 max of 86.3.  Do you think that when Kipchoge was 12 he had a VO2 max of 86.3?  No.  It was probably a lot higher than your VO2 max at age 12.  But, obviously, he's been training at a very high level since age 16, and he's now  35.

Athletes have responded with better fitness, better court coverage, different playing styles and tactics, and overall better athleticism.  The game is unarguably better than when people were running around in tennis whites, canvas sneaker, and swinging wooden frames.

Shoe manufacturers responded to the faster game by improvements in shoe technology, which allows players to grip the court, change direction, and accelerate / decelerate faster - as necessitated by the faster pace of play.

And the improvements in tennis performance (serve speed, etc.) brought on by racket technology are WAY more than 4%.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that a nationally ranked 16-year old (of today) would beat the US Open champion from the wooden racket era.

The purpose of long runs is to build aerobic base and muscle endurance.  The key factor is time on feet, not speed.  So by running too fast, you're actually diminishing the training benefit of the long run by getting it over quicker and reducing time on feet.  

Also, do you have a particular plan you're following?  If not, definitely get one.  Your training will be much more effective if you follow a structured plan that is designed for your goal race.  

Higdon has [plans online](https://www.halhigdon.com/training/half-marathon-training/) with descriptions for purpose and pace of each run.  If you understand the purpose and pace of each type of run (easy, tempo, long) you will have an easier time (mentally) sticking to the pace.  Don't run easy or long runs too fast....it won't make you faster on race day.

Half marathon goal pace at 1:45 is 8:00 miles.  Assuming, you're actually at this fitness level, your general long runs will be at easy pace, which is in the range of 8:40 to 9:30.  

Some plans have you start long runs at easy pace and then progress to steady pace (halfway b/n easy and marathon pace) and then to marathon pace (8:20).  So an 11 mile long run for HM might be 1 mi warmup @ 9:40, 3 mi @ 9:00, 3 mi @ 8:40, 3 mi @ 8:20, 1 mi cooldown at 9:40.

When you run, you're hitting the ground repeatedly with your feet.  This creates forces and stresses on bones and connective tissues that are higher than you are used to.  The forces (from the ground, through your feet to your ankles to your shins, to your knees, and to your hips) are proportional to your body weight.  The heavier you are, the greater the force.  The faster you run, the greater the force.  That's simple physics.

The good news is the longer you run, assuming you build up slowly, the more your body will adapt - bone density will increase, connective tissues will get stronger....not to mention the muscle and cardio improvement.

You're in a difficult spot right now.  You want to run because it's an effective way to tip the CICO balance in your favor.  But you don't want to do something self-defeating like give yourself an injury or make yourself miserable and turn yourself off of running because of the aches and pains.

My suggestion is to find equivalent low impact cardio (elliptical, stationary bike, regular bike, hill walking, roller blading, cardio / boot camp classes, anything that gets your heart rate up into the aerobic zone) to mix in with running.  Even when running, I think you're going to need to mix in some walking.  (But you can do speed walking and still keep your heart rate at a reasonable level.)  Do this until you start seeing weight reduction and foot strengthening / pain reduction from running.

As your weight comes down (slowly) and your body gets stronger (slowly) running will get easier and more enjoyable.

Good luck.

ps - Couple other other things that comes to mind:

1. Proper running form.  When running, you went your foot fall to occur below your body, not out in front.  Have a friend video you and watch it on slow-motion to see where your foot strikes the ground relative to your body.  Check out [this page for an image of over-striding](https://news.sanfordhealth.org/orthopedics/over-striding/) and some advice.
2. Proper warm up.  You want to learn to do dynamic stretching and warm up before running.  Then when you start, run slowly until you start to feel warm.
3. Massage.  To help with foot / ankle pain, you can learn to massage the areas that are giving you trouble.  I spend about an equal time running and stretching / foam rolling / massaging feet and ankles."

Tempo pace is usually somewhere between half marathon and 10k pace.  Sometimes it is described as 25 seconds slower than 5k pace.  They're geared towards a 20-30 minute run (at a pace you can maintain for 1 hour), sometimes repeated with a break in between sets.

Either way, I've always seen them as separate from marathon pace.  

Daniels calculator says (based on your 6:40 MP), your 20 minute tempo run is 6:19 for a distance of 3.2 mi.  30 min tempo run is 6:27 for a distance of 4.7 mi.

As you get faster overall, your tempo run gets closer to your MP run.  A 2:10 marathoner has a MP of 4:57 and a 30 minute tempo pace of 4:51.

Or if you do a much longer tempo run, and adjust pace to maintain intensity, the tempo pace drops to your MP run.  But at that point it's not really a tempo run anymore.

(I may be telling you things you already know, so apologies in advance.)"

running,fe8hsd3,t1_fe7sjxc,1578926301.0,"This looks like it's from one of Higdon's marathon plans.

On my last marathon, I followed HH Adv 2.  Saturday / Sunday would generally have a 10 mi pace followed by 20 mi easy.  Towards the end, I switched up and did 10 mi easy followed by 10easy/10pace - which I found to be harder, but also a good confidence builder.  It was good to know I could do 10 at MP after already being tired from 10 mi the previous day, and 10 mi easy that day.

\*Also, unless you're a 2:10 - 2:30 marathoner, MP is not tempo.  True tempo runs would be faster than MP (by about 25-30 seconds pace) and shorter than 10 miles."
running,fe8fjq8,t1_fe7u4yo,1578925616.0,"Everything I've read says your easy pace (like all paces) should correlate to a heart rate range of 65-75% of max heart rate.

If you've improved your fitness (as shown by your full times) then your easy pace should increase also.

I run at about the same speeds you do.  My first full was 3:48 (?) and I'm currently working on a 1:30 half.  Going strictly by Daniels, your easy runs should be in the 8:00 - 8:40 range, with recovery runs maybe at 9:00 - 9:30.

The risk of keeping your easy runs too slow (less than 9:30) is you're not getting the full aerobic benefit because you're not getting to 65% of max heart rate.

On the flip side, unless your Strava friends are significantly faster (2:30 marathon), they're definitely running too fast."
running,fe8cl2m,t1_fe80dbd,1578924816.0,There was a [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40279-019-01237-z) posted on r/AdvancedRunning that states treadmill running is the same as road running.
running,fe88z4v,t1_fe81874,1578923879.0,"like u/brothaman182 says, find a plan (you've got plenty of time).  Higdon, Daniels, Pftizinger all make good plans.  Runner's world and some other magazines have their plans online.  Higdon's plans and descriptions of what the different purposes and types of runs are [here](https://www.halhigdon.com/training/marathon-training/).

Basically, to go from half marathon to full, you're going to slowly and methodically build up weekly mileage by no more than 10%.  Your long runs will also increase by about the same percentage.

The combination of increased weekly mileage and individual long run mileage will develop the muscular endurance, which will prevent your legs from becoming jelly.

Based on your half time (not sure if that was a 100% effort or just fun run), you should shoot for around a 3:50 marathon pace.  If you have specific speed goals (or even just to get a better handle on your capabilities), you'll want a real race effort at 10k or half marathon.  You use race efforts to judge current fitness and base training paces off that.  (Use the [Daniels Calculator](https://runsmartproject.com/calculator/) to establish paces for different types of runs.)

Beyond that, I would strongly recommend getting one of the books by Higdon, Pftizinger or Daniels for marathon training.  There's a world of good information (training, diet, pacing, injury prevention, etc.), and you will train better if you understand the physiological concepts behind the training plans."

There’s a limit to how many strides you can take in a given time because of the inertia of your legs.

So basically if you’re running faster, you’re taking longer strides.  In order to do that, you have to have a longer flight time, which means you’re in the air longer, which means your center of mass gets higher off the ground.

Having a stride that puts you higher off the ground means landing and rebounding forces (feet, knees, legs, hips) will be higher."

AdvancedRunning,fdoi7zg,t3_emebvd,1578605666.0,"This is the dilemma of planning to run a race (in the future) at a pace faster than you are currently capable of....i.e. improving your performance.

Every race plan I've read says to calculate your paces for that day / week / month based on current level of fitness.  As you train, you're (presumably) improving your performance, so your training paces should gradually get faster.  That's part of the reason you run true race efforts during the plan, so you can gauge current fitness and reset your training paces.

If your goal race pace is reasonable, you should see your current fitness level begin to approach your goal fitness level.

That being said, I would think you should be able to run shorter distances at race pace from the get go....especially 10k pace, HM pace, etc."
