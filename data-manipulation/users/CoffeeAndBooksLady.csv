Clarifying shampoo gently strips the hair of that excess ""stuff"" without damaging it in such a way that soap could.

I use The Ordinary Rosehip Seed Oil and Hyaluronic Acid mixed into St Ives Collagen and Elastin Moisturizer after I shower on my face. The Ordinary products are like $7/bottle and the moisturizer is around $5/tub.

I use CeraVe moisturizer on my body. The tubs are 2/$20 at Costco. It lasts a really long time as it is thick so you don't need a lot. I have super dry skin and this stuff works really well."

When I was in college, there were classes that were 50 minutes, an hour and a half or 3 hours. The shorter classes met 2-3 times per week and the 3 hour met once a week. If you have trouble sitting through a class for 3 hours, choose classes that are shorter in length that meet more frequently."
