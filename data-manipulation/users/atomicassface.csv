Btw, I think  it will be a super flattering cut and color for you!"
femalehairadvice,ff3htbk,t1_ff3g1co,1579541341.0,"If you’ve ever dyed your hair before, there’s going to be leftover pigments in the hair that will affect how your hair looks if bleached. To get this look, you will have to bleach your hair. 

It’s very expensive and risky to lighten your own hair at home especially if you’re going 5+ levels lighter. You should really go to a salon to achieve this look. It could really end up disastrous if you try to do it on your own. 

Never bleach with box dye and for colors like this, you’ll have better luck going to a Sally’s or other beauty supply."
Botchedsurgeries,ff24mt6,t1_ff24chj,1579493678.0,Oof! I think it stood out because the woman in the picture is laying down as well as that it looks to be fresh out of surgery. Guess it’s not botched so I’m gonna delete!
Botchedsurgeries,ff23txu,t1_ff23hkl,1579493055.0,Thankfully I live in LA so there’s a lot of good surgeons out here. I’m going to try and save up for the best doctor I can get. It really sucks that there’s no option for a lift or reduction that doesn’t leave the extensive scarring though :(
Botchedsurgeries,ff23npd,t1_ff23hdx,1579492918.0,Yeah it seems like it leaves a lot of scarring regardless. Is this just normal post op?
AskReddit,ff21s5w,t1_ff20au7,1579491484.0,"When you look on the registry, it shows what the person is on the registry for. I have a child and checked the areas around my home when I moved and everyone on the list was on it for rape or possession of child pornography. There were hundreds in the list and none of them were for anything the situation you described."

thisismylifenow,fd01dx6,t1_fd017dy,1578112184.0,Wel her 3rd word was doggo and 4th was Atti-coo

thisismylifenow,fczog8e,t1_fczlzla,1578105685.0,Not really. We’ve had him for almost 7 years and he’s never even growled at anyone or anything.
thisismylifenow,fcyn8pa,t1_fcymqct,1578083216.0,Big dogs are my favorite! My dads dog is a chocolate lab and the biggest sweetheart. He’s also really good with kids. The only time he comes close to hurting her is when he wags his tail and it hits her.

LadyBoners,fcyhp5w,t1_fcyhffi,1578080348.0,Hispanic is correct but I think that Latino is considered more politically correct.
LadyBoners,fcyhjzr,t1_fcyhdhm,1578080267.0,"They’re Latino. 

Latinos are people from Latin America. Hispanics are people of Spanish origin including some, but not all Latinos. Spaniards are people from Spain."
LadyBoners,fcy6tn6,t3_ejde2o,1578075629.0,They’re not Spanish though?

Postpartum_Depression,fc50lc3,t3_eg7xz1,1577436950.0,"My daughter is a few days away from one and I’m finally starting to come out of the PPD. I have my moments where I break down but it’s not anywhere near as bad as it has been. It’s less of a permanent depression and more just fleeting feelings frustration and grief(over my life before motherhood). I’m a SAHM so it can be really lonely and exasperating to spend 100% of my time with my daughter(and 90% just me and her). 

I’d say age 6-8 months was the hardest for me. It was extremely overwhelming when my daughter  became mobile because I lost a lot of freedom with being able to get chores done because she was no longer content being stationary in her playpen. She started needed more stimulation and interaction which felt so difficult to give due to feeling mentally burnt out. As I’ve gotten more accustomed to it, it’s gotten a lot easier and I’m much less stressed with day to day life. 

I think my hormones have adjusted a lot more too. I still breastfeed so it’s not back to normal but it’s gotten much better. Once my periods started coming back, I started getting back to myself a bit more. 

The biggest thing that helped me was being able to leave my daughter alone. Introducing solids and getting her to a point where they made up a significant portion of her diet made it a lot easier to leave her with a babysitter so that I could get some alone time. 

Things will get better, just try to take things one day at a time and reach out to your support system for help when you need it."
