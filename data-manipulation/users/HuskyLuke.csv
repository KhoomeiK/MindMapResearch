Games,fd5qd7l,t3_ejtziv,1578180299.0,"**TL;DR: Try playing different types of games, for example if you're finding you never finish openworld RPGs then try something more linear.**  
  
Too Short; Please Elaborate: I evntually learned that I had to accept that the type of games I actually enjoy playing has changed. I used to be all up in open world RPGs but now they just have the effect you mentioned.   
  
I didn't finish Skyrim, Fallout 4, etc. Whereas in my teens/early twenties I'd do things like finishing a 100+ hour playthrough of Fallout: New Vegas in a week and then start again and get 150+ hours out of it over more weeks on my second playthrough. I think I was well over 200 hours on one playthrough where I never fast travelled, I went every where in real time. I jsut can't do that nowadays.   
  
I instead play very linear and kinda simpler games. Even Outer Worlds was great because it was much shorter and less open, you were kinda channel down a few relatively narrow routes and it worked great for me, finished it in like a week and a half, maybe two weeks and it was great. Also very simple and/or linear games like Mad Max are great because there is less side stuf to distract so I get through them and they need less thinking about because there is no real choice. That and games with no real end where it's jsut about enjoying the mechanics like Minecraft, Squad (to scratch that multiplayer FPS itch), or even Path of Exile which techincally has a plot and end poitn I suppose but I played it first years ago and now I jsut play it to level a character and try make a cool build.    
    
Also I used to play everything on the hardest settings, now I play 70% of things on normal, 20% of them on easy and 10% on hard. I just want to enjoy myself, I already enough challenges in work and normal adult life; games can jsut be fun.    

So basically, if games are stressing you or feeling like pressure and/or a chore, then there is nothing wrong with you jsut need to change what you're playing. You interests/needs/mindset has change a bit over time, which is natural and you need to adjust for that."

So I play in a campaign that has some different rules about healing and crits and resting, etc. It's a pretty tough one to be honest. Also the DM advances things in the world realistically based on what we do or don't do. So near the start of the campaign we went to a dungeon and started it but got really fucked up, so we went back to town to rest up for a week and when we came back the place had been looted. Turns out we had gotten super close to finishing it, so when an NPC party came upon it they did the last bit, took all the spoils and got all the credit. This NPC party immediately became hated by us of course and now there is a continue side arc of them having great success and us hating their damn guts."

Less anecdotally, but still pretty subjective: I think most of us have seen an general greater acceptance/mainstreaming of need culture over the years. Like when I was a teenager being into comics or D&D or whatever was something that would be ridiculed. Nowadays I mention these sorts of interests and most people have some curiosity about them. I know that partially down to age but things like the MCU making some nerdy stuff generally more popular/accepted and other factors like the European economic recession leading to a boost in interest in boardgames/tabletop games have led to much greater interest in the likes of D&D.
