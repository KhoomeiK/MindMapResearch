Feel free to send PM if you have any questions or wanna get more indepth. I just love helping out with this cos we've had great results with my friends and random reddit strangers haha!

It's not just profile but also about approaching and first dates etc."
hingeapp,ff6qnt9,t3_erwx2d,1579632859.0,"First picture is very good. Loving the colours and vibe.

The first description is okay funny but quite generic. Still I guess it shows you are looking for more long-term and have a sense of humour so it's not bad. Just could be something more catching :)

Second picture you look very pretty and I think this shows an activity that you enjoy as well.

Third picture shows you more in action but it's not my favourite. It doesn't really add that much to your persona and hobbies so maybe that type of photo could be better.

Second description is also very generic. It's hard to imagine a person who doesn't enjoy finding hidden gems.

4th picture is fun. Not super typical and presumably shows you doing something that you are interested in.

Third description is short but sweet. Still I think there could be better ones out there but it's not bad.

5th pic shows you with a friend and more active which is great. We all want to know that people have friends.

6th picture is unflattering.

I would remove 3rd and 6th. Replace with something that shows you doing something, possibly with friends and also full body as previously requested. However, it's always good to concentrate on showing your personality, hobbies, interests, sense of humour INSTEAD of trying to pose and be as appealing as possible. Aim for quality, not for quantity."
hingeapp,ff6q1hz,t1_ff6ipnt,1579632492.0,"I disagree completely. By showing personality you attract quality over quantity. It's great to be funny and give something of yourself. Otherwise the other one can only talk about your looks or send a very generic ""hi"".

It's sad to see people who think their only asset is their looks. Then there ain't much to talk about."

dating,ff4jc0l,t3_erlmij,1579564991.0,"Don't be hasty. It's only one date so it can be hard to fid the spark straight away. Good thing would be to do something that gets you out of your comfort zone, gets some adrenaline going. You are very used to each others company so dating is very different to just dating someone you don't know.

If you trul think this person is like a brother to you, then sure call it off. Tell it straight that you are not feeling it. No bad timing or anything of that as then he still keeps pining over you and waiting for that moment.

But I honestly recommend that you try to jump from this 6-month build up to actually seeing what it's like to date him and give it a bit more time. It can be awkward at first. Awkward is not necessarily bad. You've learnt a completely different way to iteractive with each other so it can be hard to turn it romantic all of a sudden."

Bumble,fds7p18,t3_emiz6n,1578696230.0,"For me it doesn't make sense to put it in my profile. I'm poly, sure. But I had a long 5+ years mono relationship and never had any issue with this. I know many just like me. So just because a person tells you they are polyamorous (depending on context ofc) it doesn't necessarily mean that they aren't interested in monogamy if that's important to their potential partner."
Tinder,fdotvt9,t1_fdnuuw8,1578612762.0,"Keep 1, 6, 11, 13

Tinder,fdosyex,t1_fdom1fo,1578612175.0,"In general your photos are good. I would delete the first photo and maybe the last one as well. The first one I don't think is very flattering and same problem with the last photo. Last one is funny but you do demonstrate your sense of humour well in other pictures already.

I would drop the line about superlikes. It just seems insecure. Rather have something else that's funny, something that tells about your interests or nothing more is good as well.

Best of luck!"
Tinder,fdos9ha,t1_fdomsie,1578611741.0,"Swipe everyone you feel like swiping. Don't decide for yourself who is in or out of your ""league"". It makes no sense. It's best to let others decide who they are attracted to and only concentrate who you find interesting. The best thing is that they will never know who you did and didn't swipe. No harm done!

I would drop photos 1, 2 and 5. I would add a photo that shows you in action doing something that you love.

Your bio is quite standard. I personally would just have the first part or then tell more about your interests. Just gives a more positive note and you can weed out people with different expectations very fast without stating already in your profile what you are looking for :)"
eharmony,fdnax1u,t1_fdnaaeo,1578581818.0,"I hear you and understand. It is a big part of your history and who you are. However, in dating this is when you are trying to create interest. You don't disclose your third nipple, past relationships or childhood traumas. Think of it similar to job application but now you are just applying for a relationship.

Definitely feel free to tell very early on about your divorce but then it will be a discussion and you get to set the tone and actually tell your backstory. I think you might be oversharing by telling it so early on to a person who doesn't yet know you, hasn't even talked to you."
AskWomenOver30,fdn8giu,t1_fdn803y,1578580093.0,"Yeah, it's not a long term solution but definitely helped me out once or twice when I was just suddenly without a place. It's much safer than lot of other public areas and you can just casually brush your teeth or even wash your armpits in the toilets and people will be super understanding cos they think you are a busy travelling bee."
eharmony,fdn7g1a,t3_elr562,1578579350.0,"**Text**  
You write well. I like how you describe yourself and your interests. I think you might be missing some humour. I do like the effort like ""tea again"" but being a bit funny is always a good look on dating profiles. This way you also have a good chance that you and the girl will have a very similar way with humour. However, you definitely seem very pleasant and warm so text is not the issue here.

**Facts**  
I necessarily wouldn't tell ""seperated"" so early on. This is information that you can disclose much later when you get to know people. 

**Pictures**  
They are not great. This is a good place to demonstrate all different sides of you. I think the 1st picture with Stonehenge is good as it highlights your interests and has natural light. 2nd picture with the snake is a bad picture of you although the pic itself is interesting. I would delete. 3rd pic with the baby shows you happy and smiling but it also raises questions of whose baby is it. Safer option is to replace this with smiley photo with friends to display your warm and social nature. 4th picture with suit on is a bad picture. The light comes from bad angle and it feels like a Linkedin profile picture. 5th I kinda like. It had some movement and your smile is pretty. 6th shows you doing something which is great but it's not the best picture of you again. But I like that you show yourself in action. I encourage you to find a better picture to showcase it. 7th is a bit dark but shows you out and about. All good. 8th is not a good picture of you.

I would delete 2, 4, 8. And replace 3, 6 with similar idea but just better pictures.

Selfies are always tricky. Usually settle with 1-3 good ones and then use the other pictures to show your interests, personality and lifestyle. It's okay to have 1-2 pictures that you are not in them but they are just good pictures of things that you love f. ex. at a concert or hiking etc.

If you don't have that many good pictures of yourself, ask a friend to take photos of you for a full day. 100-200 photos doing the most random activities. You need a lot of photos because it usually takes time until you relax infront of a camera. Or then just have less photos. It's always better option than filling the profile with shots that don't do you favours.

Best of luck out there!"
AskWomenOver30,fdmvobv,t3_em3p6c,1578567976.0,"I was homeless for almost 6 months. I mostly tried to get somebody's couch and I do have some good friends but I never wanted to overstay my welcome. Occasionally I would secretly sleep at my workplace or at this 24/7 gym. Only once did I sleep outside and then I tried to stay in a well-lit area where I know there's a lot of people throughout the night. I didn't have a car so a few times I travelled to the nearest airport. There no one looks you funny if you are sleeping with a suitcase with you. You are kinda part of the furniture.

dating,fd22a24,t3_ejrmcj,1578140560.0,"I'm sorry that this happened to you. At least you had her do this in person and not by ghosting or fading which seems to be the typical move for people who lack emotional intelligence and/or afraid of commitment. Still sucks and I feel like winter is the worst time to be single as well.

I just want to point out something. I honestly don't think that month and a half is the point where you necessarily stop talking to other people and this is not a red flag. If you haven't agreed on exclusivity, it's always tricky to expect it. I'm very focused on finding my partner in life but one aspect of it is multidating. If I presume exclusivity when it's not there, I only sabotage my own mission to find a suitable partner.

But definitely her relationship history and lack of emotional vulnerability were the indicators here that she was not ready. All the best and I hopefully your next is THE one."
dating,fd0rjqu,t1_fczp7a6,1578122801.0,"I feel like this goes to many others as well. Funny people don't have to write ""funny"" or ""humor"" to their profile as they can demonstrate it."
witcher,fcx0w2q,t1_fcx0irv,1578046231.0,I'm not specifically agreeing with their choices but it makes sense that they want to keep Buring on the screen.

witcher,fcx07kp,t1_fcx001z,1578045342.0,I was thinking about this as well. Didn't get too distracted as the show was enjoyable. But just wondering if they care to explain these turn of events or Tissaia even can follow her original plot line. I do understand that tv adaptions need to take liberties from original source so mostly just interested to see how this plays out.
AskReddit,fcwzjt4,t1_fcwziia,1578044474.0,I also use Ecosia but I'm a dirty hippie so there's that.
witcher,fcwzeh8,t3_ejd30t,1578044280.0,This didn't happen in the books at all. I was thinking the exact same. Did Fringilla feel some mercy towards her old teacher? More probably just clumsy writing to make Tissaia powerless but not to dispose the character. It would be obvious to kill such opponent in the battlefield.

dating,fcr35q7,t3_eid52z,1577896110.0,"To my experience the happiest couples are the ones who are very proud to be together and are declaring it very openly. My generation uses social media a lot. If the spouse is hardly seen in their feed but otherwise they post at least sometimes, it's usually an indicator that they are not doing that strong (some exceptions ofc). It usually shows investment and psychological studies show that people feel more gratitude and commitment when there is investment. It increases the level of commitment which is why we have public announcements for getting engaged or big parties for weddings etc. It's a similar thing.

Sure there are some people where the behaviour comes from insecurity but in my circle of friends the ones making these loving posts are usually the strongest couples."

AskWomenOver30,fcd5jhh,t3_eh189p,1577606621.0,"I only know one marriage that I envy the companionship. One of my best friends has been together with his hubby for 16 years, 10 years married. They are as happy as ever. Lot of intimacy, caring, almost daily sex. What is boils down to is respect. They always aim to treat each other the nicest way possible even when there's hardship. And there has been a lot. Unexpected death and disease in the close family, one of them being hospitalised for half a year and then recovery, losing jobs, all sorts of things that could easily break people apart. Instead they've grown together. They constantly say their secret is communication and respect.

It's constant to see couples talking to each other very nasty way. It's supposed to be the one you love the most and then you treat them the worst. I've appreciated having this model of a very wholesome relationship close to me as then I know exactly what I'm looking for."

AskWomen,fc5q51j,t1_fc5pbgm,1577463555.0,"Haha I actually did ""lose"" a guy to her once back in 2011. She has no idea but I had been just casually dating this dude who then suddenly went on a date with her instead. They didn't work out so I thought it's best not to tell. I didn't think she would've appreciated knowing as their thing was already over when I found out about it.

We have always been in good terms with her and she has been my PT through my change. We often hit the gym together and she is very much on my side with everything. We have always been close.

I don't know if I'm happier because of my looks. I notice I'm more suspicious of people but overall I think my nature is quite trusting and open so usually those feelings pass quite quick. Overall I think I live a happier life cos I'm more in tune with my own needs but that would be just as possible with or without my physical transformation."

AskWomen,fc5me9v,t1_fc5eaan,1577461418.0,"I think I had always been very focused on other people (or animals) and their well-being. I volunteered a lot. Spent hours on developing myself and trying to make the world a better place. I honestly think I was a better person 5 years ago. Then I just got tired of it all, more selfish. Instead on investing on others I started investing on myself.

Just some general things: I watched makeup and hair tutorials for looks that would suit me, I started shopping for flattering attire when previously I would only shop second hand, I started very time demanding excercise routine and pole dancing and overall I started being more assertive of what I want and need. Hold my head high and was proud of who I am and what I represent. 

All this changed how I'm perceived. Then I am somewhat lucky as well as I don't have any wrinkles and my skin is in good condition. But I honestly think bigger thing is really finding a makeup/hair/dressing style that suits your body and facial features. It changes everything."
