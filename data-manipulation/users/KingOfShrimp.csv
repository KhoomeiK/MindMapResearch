aoe2,ff9m9bd,t1_ff8qmeo,1579715956.0,"Just for reference, building armor is up to 11 points higher in post imperial age from dark age. That is a lot weaker for regular ranged / melee units, but shouldn't measurably affect proper anti-building weaponry (a 100 point boost in damage is right out). The more you know!"

AskReddit,feu6bo2,t1_fes1xtl,1579383522.0,"Actually, total data usage is expanding faster than internet bandwidth recently, so Google is likely to continue such practices. The saying ""never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes"" is becoming just as relevant again, as advancement in technology is allowing for tape with phenomenal storage density increases and decreases in manufacturing costs is making it cheaper at scale than hard drives."
technology,fet5k9c,t1_fesw23l,1579372026.0,"Unfortunately, virtually every ""regulatory oversight"" is more difficult and expensive for small businesses to comply with. Compliance doesn't get much easier for having fewer employees.

If anything, there are many regulations in place *that the giant corporations love* because they know how much more effectively the regulations will drown small businesses that might want to compete.

So the question is how to regulate that doesn't end up being a net positive for the bullies."

We are certainly an anomaly! That was really my point–we are incidentally destructive in ways that other life is not well equipped to handle. We are also the only animals smart enough to develop moral frameworks. For that reason, I don't think other animals can be evil, and we can't compare ourselves to them."
pics,fenbran,t1_femwmep,1579281291.0,"We defined morality in the first place, so we can only be evil if we define ourselves to be. Overconsumption has many consequences, but I wouldn't personally say people are evil because they consume to the point of destruction–every animal species will do so without predators. We are just capable of doing it on a scale no other animal is capable of."
pcmasterrace,fefx6pp,t1_feesazp,1579068155.0,"I'll let you in on a little secret: engineers get paid well because they make the manufacturing of products as cheap as possible *while still technically functioning*. So stuff is flimsier because engineers have found ways to remove material (and therefore cost) while still technically allowing it to function.

Anyone can build a bridge. It takes an engineer to build a bridge that will fail at exactly 5x its rated load bearing capacity."

aww,fecgchj,t1_febnk8y,1578973246.0,Well historically they were among the best at getting into and spoiling food. It's a lot easier to love them now that seeing them doesn't mean potential starvation!
aww,fd4x4nf,t1_fd3tbao,1578171918.0,"Every day, I am thankful that humans are very large animals, as I imagine every animal <10 lbs has to fear death by unexpected aerial attack be it from Eagle / pelicans to wasps / dragonflies and everything in between.

I saw a video of them lining up and just swallowing baby seabirds whole. Apparently, it was partially due to overfishing, but it was clear this wasn't some recently developed trait. When you see a Pelican / Stork you are seeing the latest versions of the pterosaurs, with the same long legs and beaks and an ancient cruelty."
