depression,fekszjc,t3_epiyby,1579206973.0,I talk to the imaginary person making me feel safe
depression,fe5h8wj,t3_enqkiy,1578869434.0,Yes. Whenever the air feels an smells a certain way or if I hear a certain song or if the weather is a certain way I remember a time when it was better or simpler and a time where I was actually happy.
SuicideWatch,fe5ey2c,t1_fe5ewbm,1578868626.0,Her name is Masie
weed,fe49ma0,t3_enn77t,1578857077.0,I‚Äôm probably gonna get shit for this but I couldn‚Äôt roll if it saved my life and I got a roller and it made it so much easier. I just pick up some pre rolled filters pop one in the roller with my bud and my joints come out great. If it wasn‚Äôt for that roller I would still be rolling joints that are smokeable but not that good.
Dreams,fdtkiif,t3_en1fjf,1578718077.0,Omg! This reminds me about the dream where I was married to the early 1980s version of Weird Al Yankovic. I told my friends about it once and they laughed so hard at it.
depression,fdt6s7n,t3_emx959,1578712664.0,"You aren‚Äôt alone. I‚Äôm almost 30 I have my own apartment and I‚Äôm still in the closet about being bisexual and gender fluid. There aren‚Äôt that many LGBTQ people in my area and when I find them, I‚Äôm not their type. My parents have been lucky I have been bringing guys home this whole time. I‚Äôve only had one girlfriend and that was back in high school. It didn‚Äôt last long because she was pretending the whole time and she was bad to me. I grew up in a Christian household and I‚Äôm a Christian as well, but I found a wonderful group who accepts you regardless of what your sexuality is. My parents are old fashioned and I‚Äôm already struggling enough and I know they won‚Äôt agree if I bring a girl home."
depression,fdl1kcp,t3_eloddk,1578515446.0,I feel the same way. No matter where I go everyone around me goes out of their way to make sure I know I‚Äôm not wanted. I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be around anymore because I‚Äôm a waste of space
treedibles,fdiyndr,t3_elmib5,1578454060.0,Looks delicious but I wouldn‚Äôt trust myself around it. I would eat a quarter of the thing and end up in a ted 2 situation where I‚Äôm asking my roommate to help me get home
thanksihateit,fdiwz7p,t3_elcuo6,1578452940.0,He also had to suck it
UmbrellaAcademy,fdb2kwd,t1_fd7pi4n,1578253047.0,"I thought Luther was okay I never really saw why they made him number one because all he has was super strength. I think it was Harold‚Äôs fault because he had a grudge against the academy for how he was treated and he manipulated Vanya in believing that her brothers and sisters never cared, and if it wasn‚Äôt for him she never would have tried to hurt Allison. Hazel and Cha Cha there may be a possibility that they are special but they haven‚Äôt shown any powers other than being practically indestructible during combat. I definitely had a soft spot for Hazel wanting to quit and be with the lady from the donut shop but Cha Cha I see as a robot with no compassion whatsoever. I feel she has feelings for Hazel and is angry at him for choosing someone else instead of her. I think Klaus is my favorite character. He‚Äôs outgoing and hilarious and breaks tension in a room with his antics. Whether it was coming in wearing Vanya‚Äòs skirt, or trying to tell 5 the story of how he waxed with chocolate pudding üòÇ."
Michigents,fcyv986,t3_ejftyj,1578087826.0,Those things pack a good punch for so little bud I love them!
Onision,fcwybhj,t1_fcwy9hw,1578042873.0,He is making movements with his hips and making fart sounds directed at the dog
Onision,fcwy96f,t1_fcw4h62,1578042789.0,Yeah this is the part of the video where he pretends to fart on the dog
Onision,fcvty19,t3_ej3k7w,1578010034.0,I feel so bad for that dog

abusiverelationships,fc7hrk9,t3_eglpbk,1577507827.0,"I have been a year free from my ex narc. It does get easier. I know he shouldn‚Äôt come back and I don‚Äôt want him back. Sadly I also feel like he took something from me and I put up a big wall around myself to keep the bad things like him out. I have my roommate and best friend to keep me company but I have practically become a shut in that only leaves the house for work, and running errands. I also feel like I can‚Äôt see my other friends anymore because a voice has been put in my head that they don‚Äôt care they just want you to air out your dirty laundry out so they can show it off to others. Sometimes I feel pathetic and worthless because that‚Äôs how he made me feel. It will take time but it will be easier soon"
Michigents,fc7eho0,t1_fc6lu9k,1577505027.0,I also enjoy juicy jays. I love the watermelon kind

Onision,fc61svq,t3_egdn5f,1577470340.0,"I was 18 or 19 when I saw my first onion video. It was his ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so emo‚Äù video I watched both of them thought it was somewhat funny and ridiculous because he‚Äôs closer to my age, but after I saw that the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm So‚Äù videos were all he made, I lost interest right away. Then a couple years later I was at my cousins house and his daughters were showing me the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a banana‚Äù video. His daughters were still in elementary school, one turning 12 and the other turning 8 at the time. I thought okay it‚Äôs cute for people that age but also kind of ridiculous for a guy close to my age to be dancing around in a banana suit. Back then I didn‚Äôt know anything about gergs personal life, or who skye was. I let Greg fade into the sunset of my mind for almost a decade until now. The only reason why I resurrected him from memory now, is because I was a victim of a piece of shit just like him for almost a good year until I got free. I wanna see him pay for what he did to his victims, because it shows people like my ex, that their not exempt from anything and won‚Äôt get away with their actions."
Onision,fc3h1pz,t3_efyon4,1577389628.0,He‚Äôs still wearing it in all of his videos
Onision,fc3gxyg,t3_efyon4,1577389561.0,He‚Äôs still wearing his wedding band in all of his videos
Onision,fbz8kts,t3_eey7wk,1577238473.0,This is disturbing on so many levels! Anyone Who refers to themselves as daddy at anytime is a creep in my book. Also normal people don‚Äôt post on their Twitter their fetishes and what gets them off. Thirdly why would we wanna know!
Onision,fbz2jck,t3_ef7tcq,1577233142.0,Hey Greg! Eat a dick!
Onision,fbwxwfh,t3_eefugd,1577162450.0,Well this post got me banned from the chat room so I must have pissed someone off
Onision,fbv40yg,t1_fbuf006,1577125063.0,I screebshotted everything he said from the time he entered and was banned. My app isn‚Äôt allowing me to show them in the comments but he said something about him still being an entertainer
Onision,fbtgrzz,t1_fbtgm80,1577078335.0,Yeah that‚Äôs what someone said to him. He made one more remark and then he was banned
dogswithjobs,fbt3sn5,t1_fbt256c,1577067541.0,It‚Äôs a mushroom that grows underground and its effects are psychedelic when ingested
abusiverelationships,fbe0pac,t3_ecr51b,1576775597.0,It‚Äôs just an act. He‚Äôs trying to make you feel guilty for breaking up with you by being the person you want him to be. If you take him back he will be worse and since you were the one to break things off he‚Äôs going to be looking for every opportunity to do it to you and it will hurt horribly. I made the mistake of taking him back the first time I broke up with him and I regretted it when he got worse because I thought if I had just stayed away like I wanted to I would have been happy again
abusiverelationships,fb6n2k3,t3_ebnnj2,1576554365.0,You can call him and tell him exactly what is up. Before you do this I recommend talking to someone you trust about what he is doing to you and say you want to end it. Secondly get your parents involved as backup. Tell them you are scared of what he will do to you. Whatever be serious but don‚Äôt make it sound biting or stabbing at him. Tell him you don‚Äôt see the relationship going any further and you are sorry. After you do this block him on social media and change your phone number immediately because he will get a burner number app just to try to call and suck you back in.  Good luck. If you feel like you are in danger at any time contact the authorities and file a PPO against him but do not tell him you are.
