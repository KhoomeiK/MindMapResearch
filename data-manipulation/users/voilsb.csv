My initial (and biased) suspicion is that ""high protein"" is laughably low (1 g/kg) and/or they're comparing vegetarian 60g/day to something like carnivore/300+ g per day, likely in sedentary populations, and probably not controlling for total calories, and seeing a small increase in risk that is less than the benefits of training and improving body composition. And if they compare 120 g/day to 220 g/day in active/training populations, the risk difference is probably too small to measure."

It's a first step towards higher certification like the Community Canine Good for and the Urban Canine Good Citizen, and it's often the first step towards therapy dog certifications.

Right now for us though, they're simply a goal post to measure progress and work towards. But it could be fun to get her certified as a therapy dog some day and visit/comfort hospitalized children."

Granted, I'm just one guy, and maybe I'm being boomer and most people don't mind. [Here's an example](https://redd.it/efuhlf) of what I like for video posts.

AskAChristian,fe4ptt9,t1_fe4ip32,1578861691.0,"I'm not saying they are equivalent, just that there is a significant percentage of Christians and/or Jews who don't believe we are born into sin. If that's what is holding you back from Christianity, you might want to look into those sects. I don't practice those, so I can't comment on when they believe people's actions count as sin, and I don't presume to think they're in agreement either.

As for those who do believe in being born into sin, I believe others are addressing that sufficiently."

Is your friend's sin greater than the adulterous woman Jesus chose not to condemn? Is it greater than the thief on death row Jesus pardoned on the cross? Is it greater than the murderer Saul whom Jesus used to spread Christianity throughout the Roman empire? 

Your friend opened up to you about some of his insecurities and history. Reciprocate. Tell him about something that you've done and scares you in light of God's holiness. Since we all have, be open and vulnerable to your friend, who chose to be open and vulnerable to you.
