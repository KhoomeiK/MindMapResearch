AskReddit,ff65rht,t3_ero8mj,1579619799.0,"13 year old me idolized my homophobic, racist, minister grandfather. I was hoping to become a minister and go to some bible college. But I am 19 now, vote democrat, and am going to a community college before transferring to be a Spanish education major. So I am not entirely sure. Also I am not racist nor homophobic. I will say that I did maybe feel the way about those two things the way my grandfather did. But I was young and impressionable. What matters is that I didn't have a phone to say anything he said. And that I have learned and become educated on how terrible my grandfather really is. That's all! Idk what 13 year old me would think, probably just surprised."

college,fekgkpt,t1_fekg176,1579199601.0,"Well, it is a bit of a story. I was on campus (I attend a community college, I am transferring to a public university this Fall.) 

And I had quit my job once I had saved 1,000 dollars to keep me afloat until I found another job. I went to our campus board where Job ads are posted. And I saw this neon green flyer that said ""Just want a lunch-buddy. Leave your snap on the flyer."" 

And I was throughly tired of not having friends amd feeling alone so I left my snapchat username down. And eventually she messaged me and we got to talking. I'm a prospective Spanish education major. 

And she is hispanic and her family is. (keep in mind I am as white as they come) so she asked if I could speak Spanish and we started carrying on in Spanish. And she was throughly impressed, so we met in person to chat in Spanish face to face, because she wanted to hear it, not see it. And she was surprised. And she I produced me to her mother. And it went from there. We just forged a friendship. She knows the city I moved to for college better than me, and she has been teaching me my way around when we hang out between classes. (Or did last semster, our class schedule doesnt coisnide anymore.)"
college,fejrh4h,t3_epchz8,1579184013.0,You'll end up making friends. I'm a freshman in college and have trouble meeting people and making friends. But I managed to make one. Sometimes one friend is all you need.
