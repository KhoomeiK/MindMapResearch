And I say that as someone who's an FDR-style progressive that keeps  being called a centrist.

What we need to recognize is that nonviolent direct action is an expression of liberty, and part of that ""animating contest"" of freedom discussed by our framers. Granted, they'd have had a complete meltdown about the civil rights movement and gone off ranting about servile insurrection, but whatever. We don't have to be the same as them.

I think that every peaceful method available is part of the democratic process. Including civil disobedience like blocking roadways and the like.

And I was sort of infuriated by the UC police during Occupy when they said that ""linking arms"" was not peaceful. 

So long as we don't let various authorities define ""nonviolent"" as ""nonexistent"" I'm a fan of nonviolent protest such as the civil rights movement.

Even if I disagree with it, such as the VCDL protest in Richmond yesterday. Which couldn't muster enough Virginians to protest so they had to bus in people from South Carolina and Georgia.

Ultimately though, this is one of the most important points ever made in political discourse regarding democracies:

>Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with.

Law and Order is not peace and justice. It's not peace or stability. It's a time bomb.

Justice and Peace means the absence of those tensions that undermine society. Law and Order means those tensions are hidden away or enshrined in our system. 

Anyone who's truly center-left should understand this and should see protests as a good thing.

After all, we're Center-*left* which means we support reform. Surely more energy for reform, more people voicing their disagreement with the current system, more energy makes the changes we seek to achieve more possible. And this should result in wider, big-tent solidarity."

But that doesn't mean that Massachusetts farmers who'd just kicked out the Brits and who didn't own slaves would be particularly worried about South Carolina slave revolts.

Turnout needs to rise in order to elect either democrats *or* third party folks. 

So the suppression tactics are:

Make people think the big two parties are basically the same, just as bad, and that third parties can't win.

In places where third parties have swept big parties out of power, such as Scotland, even in FPTP elections, it's taken massive voter turnout increases. So either you increase excitement and encourage voter turnout, or you're helping the establishment.

And this sort of thing isn't pro-third party. It's pro-apathy.

forwardsfromgrandma,fdqn4pn,t1_fdqiact,1578670591.0,">You're putting liberals in the same bag as social democrats and leftists. That's why we're diverging. 

I am because that's how American politics works. There are people *you* would call Liberals in the Democratic Party, for example, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, and Joe Manchin. 

Then there are social liberals, like Hillary Clinton and Pete Buttigieg who are to the left of those.

Then there are Social Democrats like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

Then there are Democratic Socialists like Lee Carter, who quotes Marx on Twitter, especially about gun control

All of these positions exist in the Democratic Party, because the Republican Party contains Right-wing and Far-Right positions, including Economic Imperialists, High Tories, Authoritarian Liberals, Ethno-Nationalists, Neoconservatives, Neoliberals, and a whole pack of other positions from right wing to far right.

The Democratic Party ranges from Left, to Center-left, to Center-right.  The Republican Party ranges from Right, to far-right.

The reason that people think the American overton window is narrower than it is is because of television news. If you watch television, center-right perspectives are the only ones allowed on corporate media, with the exception of Fox News, which allows for far-right views, and which brings on specially selected leftists to mock them.

But if, like many younger Americans, you *read* your news, then the overton window is much broader. And if you look at party politics in the US, it's broader than the media would like to admit.

There have always been publications like Nation, New Republic, and lately Jacobin, which express center-left and left-wing views.

Broadcast media still uses ""Liberal"" as a shorthand for ""Democratic Party"" and ""Conservative"" for ""Republican Party."" Print media does not.

So ironically ""Liberal Democrat"" has come to mean leftist democrat, and ""Conservative Republican"" has come to mean the far-right.

So for most Americans Liberal and Conservative don't have any meaning other than party affiliation.

So you are correct if you're discussing political philosophies, and you are correct about Brazilian politics, but you're being downvoted because in American English, the words Liberal and Conservative do not have a fixed meaning.

Again, you are correct about the philosophical definition, but not about the way these words are commonly used.

And as someone from Brazil, I think your experiences and perspectives are important, and ones most Americans won't hear. So if you can avoid those words: Liberal and Conservative, or learn to deal with how Americans use them, Americans will look past the words you use and see the ideas you are trying to share.

Whereas England is a washed up old empire drinking to the glory days of its imperial past, Scotland is an older nation that recognizes that things change over time. And as a result it's looking to the future.

And they're just smarter than the English. For example, the reason they have free (at the point of use) prescription medicines up there is that they realized that it was less expensive to just provide everyone with medication than it was to hire an entire state apparatus to supervise means testing.

Any sort of means testing about who gets what medication, and who has to pay this percentage or that percentage means hiring an army of bureaucrats to supervise it. Paying that army of bureaucrats will always be more expensive than just keeping things simple.

In contrast, England keeps spending mountains of money in order to save money. And it hasn't been working because that can't ever work. They're really bad at running things lately.

And I say that as someone who's an FDR-style progressive that keeps  being called a centrist.

What we need to recognize is that nonviolent direct action is an expression of liberty, and part of that ""animating contest"" of freedom discussed by our framers. Granted, they'd have had a complete meltdown about the civil rights movement and gone off ranting about servile insurrection, but whatever. We don't have to be the same as them.

I think that every peaceful method available is part of the democratic process. Including civil disobedience like blocking roadways and the like.

And I was sort of infuriated by the UC police during Occupy when they said that ""linking arms"" was not peaceful. 

So long as we don't let various authorities define ""nonviolent"" as ""nonexistent"" I'm a fan of nonviolent protest such as the civil rights movement.

Even if I disagree with it, such as the VCDL protest in Richmond yesterday. Which couldn't muster enough Virginians to protest so they had to bus in people from South Carolina and Georgia.

Ultimately though, this is one of the most important points ever made in political discourse regarding democracies:

>Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with.

Law and Order is not peace and justice. It's not peace or stability. It's a time bomb.

Justice and Peace means the absence of those tensions that undermine society. Law and Order means those tensions are hidden away or enshrined in our system. 

Anyone who's truly center-left should understand this and should see protests as a good thing.

After all, we're Center-*left* which means we support reform. Surely more energy for reform, more people voicing their disagreement with the current system, more energy makes the changes we seek to achieve more possible. And this should result in wider, big-tent solidarity."

I am because that's how American politics works. There are people *you* would call Liberals in the Democratic Party, for example, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, and Joe Manchin. 

Then there are social liberals, like Hillary Clinton and Pete Buttigieg who are to the left of those.

Then there are Social Democrats like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

Then there are Democratic Socialists like Lee Carter, who quotes Marx on Twitter, especially about gun control

All of these positions exist in the Democratic Party, because the Republican Party contains Right-wing and Far-Right positions, including Economic Imperialists, High Tories, Authoritarian Liberals, Ethno-Nationalists, Neoconservatives, Neoliberals, and a whole pack of other positions from right wing to far right.

The Democratic Party ranges from Left, to Center-left, to Center-right.  The Republican Party ranges from Right, to far-right.

The reason that people think the American overton window is narrower than it is is because of television news. If you watch television, center-right perspectives are the only ones allowed on corporate media, with the exception of Fox News, which allows for far-right views, and which brings on specially selected leftists to mock them.

But if, like many younger Americans, you *read* your news, then the overton window is much broader. And if you look at party politics in the US, it's broader than the media would like to admit.

There have always been publications like Nation, New Republic, and lately Jacobin, which express center-left and left-wing views.

Broadcast media still uses ""Liberal"" as a shorthand for ""Democratic Party"" and ""Conservative"" for ""Republican Party."" Print media does not.

So ironically ""Liberal Democrat"" has come to mean leftist democrat, and ""Conservative Republican"" has come to mean the far-right.

So for most Americans Liberal and Conservative don't have any meaning other than party affiliation.

So you are correct if you're discussing political philosophies, and you are correct about Brazilian politics, but you're being downvoted because in American English, the words Liberal and Conservative do not have a fixed meaning.

Again, you are correct about the philosophical definition, but not about the way these words are commonly used.

And as someone from Brazil, I think your experiences and perspectives are important, and ones most Americans won't hear. So if you can avoid those words: Liberal and Conservative, or learn to deal with how Americans use them, Americans will look past the words you use and see the ideas you are trying to share.

Because god knows none of them are going to learn Portuguese."

forwardsfromgrandma,fdqh442,t1_fdqdks8,1578666521.0,"> Except liberals in the US are still at most center-right

That isn't true. American liberals have supported:

Medicare for All, Single Payer Healthcare, A job guarantee program that pays *above* a living wage, free college education, massive welfare state investments, nationalization of the cargo railways and their expansion, the building of publicly owned high speed rail, taxation to deal with wealth inequality, expansion and protection of trades unions, a tobin tax on financial expenditures, and a whole mess of other social democratic proposals.

There are also social liberals, who would be center-right people who are liberal on social issues like LGBT rights and the like, but ""Liberal Democrat"" as opposed to ""democrat"" used to mean the social-democracy wing of the party, the left flank.

Lately, the word ""progressive"" has replaced ""liberal"" in the parlance of younger democrats, but there's a consistent Social-Democratic movement in the Democratic party going back to the Progressive Era and FDR.

It's not that the overton window is far to the right, it's that it's incredibly broad, so as to include those left wing ideas but also conservative ones as well, unfortunately."

Eisenhower started it in the 1950s. And from the 1950s to the 1970s, Americans were conscripted and sent to fight a brutal, pointless war they didn't want to fight.

Whereas England is a washed up old empire drinking to the glory days of its imperial past, Scotland is an older nation that recognizes that things change over time. And as a result it's looking to the future.

And they're just smarter than the English. For example, the reason they have free (at the point of use) prescription medicines up there is that they realized that it was less expensive to just provide everyone with medication than it was to hire an entire state apparatus to supervise means testing.

Any sort of means testing about who gets what medication, and who has to pay this percentage or that percentage means hiring an army of bureaucrats to supervise it. Paying that army of bureaucrats will always be more expensive than just keeping things simple.

In contrast, England keeps spending mountains of money in order to save money. And it hasn't been working because that can't ever work. They're really bad at running things lately.

I suspect that they *always* were and were just stealing enough wealth from the colonies that it didn't matter how bad they were at things, they could just throw money at problems until they went away.

This is not the same product as we have. Ours are steel-toe, and this doesn't mention whether it has that feature or not. It appears to be one of the fashion-line ""heritage"" boots.

Also, that boot costs nearly $400 over there! For a product that appears to be inferior!

To get to that price level over here, you need to have a ton of extra features like electrical insulation, waterproofing, environmental insulation... so the super-specialized line. And none of them are that expensive.

To top it all off... London.

They're focused specifically on being work boots for tradesmen because tradesmen will spend money on things that keep them from losing feet and toes in accidents. 

They're more expensive, but I got a 200-lb pipe dropped on my toe and the composite toe-shield shrugged it off like it was nothing.

I want to get the loggers because they have a steel shank running through the sole so when you're standing on a ladder, it feels like you're standing on the ground.

I did some googling and they have a work-boot shop in Aberdeen focused on servicing the oil industry there.

People in my trade swear by these things, and after dealing with demolishing an incredibly unsafe facility (so that it could be re-built as safe) I swear by them too.
