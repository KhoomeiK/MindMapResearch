DeadBedrooms,ffxjtry,t3_evo1vi,1580326589.0,Thanks for this post.  We are in counseling as well (not a sex specialist) so learning from others experience is so appreciated.
DeadBedrooms,ffssg9v,t3_eutkkt,1580190798.0,"Online therapy is great and you won't have to switch to a new counselor when you move.  Just a thought.  Granted, if you need meds, you'll have to see a Dr in person probably but what you are describing sounds like something that would be better worked on with talk therapy at least at first.

I also definitely relate to your post.  

One story: my ex rarely wanted to have sex.  I would get turned down alot.  But sometimes he would basically start having sex with me in my sleep.  I would wake up and realize what he was trying to do and we would have this nice little middle of the night sex moment. I really enjoyed it.   But in hindsight it feels bad...like maybe the reason he did that is bc he wasn't attracted to me and those nights weren't actually fun/romantic/a touch kinky like I thought...but were really just him relieving a basic need into the only vessel available.  I might as well have been a sex doll.

Another story: similar situation with my current partner - we rarely have sex.  And when we do I get so in my head. I start thinking ""why now?"", ""How can we replicate this?"",. ""is he attracted to me or just trying to relieve that basic need?"" ""What if I'm not good at sex?"", And ""gosh, how long until we get to do this again?"".  I try to turn it around and just enjoy the moment so that he doesn't feel rejected or pressured.  But it's hard bc I know I'm going to feel lonely and sad afterward...whereas when we aren't having sex I can often just turn the volume down on the inner voice that's telling me I'm not good enough"
DeadBedrooms,ffqqtkr,t3_eum6fm,1580141501.0,Lol!  Im always floored by the the pushback.  I mean sex doesn't take that long....it can just be a few minutes.  And in the end you get to orgasm.  Why on Earth wouldn't you want that?!  Also we spend more time doing unpleasant things like the dishes...you can't make time for sex?
DeadBedrooms,ffpm1bz,t1_ffpl7n4,1580098393.0,"Nope, never rejected him with any consistently.  Honestly I've probably only rejected sex once or twice the whole relationship...and it was good reason like my period just starting.

Maybe he doesn't realize I'm giving him the greenlight....but that seems u likely since he knows I want to have more sex.  It's just so strange....why would you touch someone like that if you didnt want it to escalate?"
Dietandhealth,ffpe701,t3_euh84w,1580092823.0,"There are so many diets...I feel like it's impossible to decide which is right and wrong.  Make sure you are eating enough veggies and minimizing processed foods.  Other than that, see what works for you and listen to your body about what feels good.  And make sure you go to the doctor regularly for physicals....to keep tabs on things like blood pressure, cholesterol, etc"
DeadBedrooms,ffpcmb0,t1_ffp9aha,1580091697.0,Yeah...it needs to be discussed.  We have counseling this week so I'll try to bring it up then
DeadBedrooms,ffp59lc,t1_ffp4w1p,1580086534.0,Gotcha.  Finding a good couples counselor can be so hard.  We are on our second try right now and I'm hopeful about this one.  But it's expensive to figure out....
DeadBedrooms,ffp4nim,t1_ffp4gxq,1580086138.0,Are y'all in counseling?  I highly recommend it if not
DeadBedrooms,ffp4dds,t1_ffp1tmv,1580085938.0,"I'll never understand why people cheat.  If it gets to that point, you have to call off your relationship first...

I cheated back in my early 20s on someone and my ex knew about it when we got together.  I remember asking him if it bothered him and he said no.  But he said he need need assurance that ""if I ever got to that point to just let him know and we could part amicably...even if I was literally driving to the dude's house to cheat""."
DeadBedrooms,ffp4612,t1_ffotvuq,1580085791.0,I'm so sorry for you.  You deserve to be a priority.  And you deserve to have your plans kept.  Does he do this with other things - flake on plans he makes?
DeadBedrooms,ffp1322,t3_eue6ow,1580084149.0,Have you confronted her about the cheating?  How did she respond?
DeadBedrooms,ffotark,t1_ffomtrb,1580081492.0,How does he respond?
DeadBedrooms,ffomjf2,t1_ffodahw,1580079191.0,"It even would have been better he could have said to you at like 3pm ""I'm going to be too tired to go out tonight"" - that at least would have been clear communication and given you time to make other plans."
DeadBedrooms,ffomb04,t1_ffokga9,1580079098.0,Perfectly said.  How did he respond?
PornFreeRelationships,ffol1nb,t1_ffoit5m,1580078781.0,"Sorry I guess I was reading between the lines incorrectly.  You said ""therapy isn't for us"" but my point is that if you find a therapist you click with and that is in your budget you might feel differently.  Therapy is so expensive though, so I get it"
PornFreeRelationships,ffokoou,t1_ffobvjv,1580078648.0,"Ugh what assholes they are.  It does sound like there are one or two ""culprits"" behind this...any idea who those guys might be?"
PornFreeRelationships,ffo9mb7,t3_etsiwg,1580075419.0,"It sounds like maybe your counselor overreacted but it also sounds like maybe you didn't treat them with the most respect for their time.  Either way, keep in mind that each counselor is different so often as necessary to shop around.  therapy can be really great for couples especially if you have difficulty communicating about certain issues... So even if you're not going to use it right now I wouldn't go so far as to make blanket statements like you don't like it or believe in it"
PornFreeRelationships,ffo8ih6,t3_eud8nm,1580075183.0,"Oh my gosh.  No, you are totally in the right about this.  This is a terrible situation....and honestly your boyfriend's friends sound like such jerks.  Honestly, it sounds like they are trying to break you guys up... Probably because they are jealous of your relationship on some level.

Ugh...this just puts you in a terrible situation.

Here's what I would do:

1) lay down the law with your boyfriend.  He is not to join this group... And he should do whatever is necessary to make sure he is not added to it (block the group or whatever)
2) talk to your boyfriend's friends.  I would do this one on one rather than as a group.  Tell them that you are not comfortable with the situation and that they are jeopardizing his relationship by continuing to disrespect you in this way.  let your boyfriend know in advance that you are going to be talking to his friends about this... He might have a problem with that and if so he needs to be the one to have the conversation with them...but I don't think it's too much to ask for you to be included on the conversation.
3) let your boyfriend know if these guidelines are not agreeable to him then the relationship is over.  This is such a basic level of decency that he is playing with... And you do not deserve to be treated this way.

for what it's worth it sounds like he's a good guy but has some really big jerks for friends.  My guess is that these guys are pretty young (you mentioned that there in college)... So most likely over the next few years this type of behavior would subside anyway... But you don't deserve to be hurt in the meantime.

As a side note I feel really bad for this girl.  she obviously has a lot of issues of her own if she feels the need to send naked pictures to a group of guys that they are then sharing around.  That type of thing can come back and hurt her so badly in the future.  And taking part in this kind of thing points to some really big problems she already has."
getdisciplined,ffmilb2,t1_ffmdbm6,1580055257.0,"Makes sense.  But now that you are working even this fun relaxation might involve too much brain power after a day at work.  Try something kind of mindless (go for a walk, meditate, work out)...and see if that maybe gives you more brain energy to focus on the fun projects you enjoy"
DeadBedrooms,ffmfhkq,t1_ffmcw0x,1580053882.0,So what could he have done to find that out during your relationship?  Rather than wait until you figured it out afterwards
getdisciplined,ffm7lt7,t3_eu4ivh,1580049849.0,"I know I got pretty down when I had my first grown-up job after college.  Not sure if that's your situation here but in hindsight I totally understand why I felt that way (can I explain if you'd like).  

I think one of the main things is that you probably use your brain a lot at work so it feels like you don't have any brain power left to focus on personal projects afterward.  

Tell me this what do you do for yourself to help clear your mind? For me getting into a habit of exercising after work is ideal but meditation going for a walk journaling etc are all good options.  I think maybe you need to find a way to draw a line in the sand between your work day and your personal life... And something that relaxes your brain and clears your mind a little bit can often be really helpful in that regard.  if you do that you might find you have the mental stamina to work on personal projects later in the evening."
DeadBedrooms,ffm6ojm,t3_eu4g2y,1580049408.0,So how does someone get that information out of someone?  I've asked point blank if he's attracted to me...he says yes.  I've offered and open relationship and he says no.  I love him and am attracted to him...but if he's not I to me that way then I don't think this will work.  But I have to get him to admit it...otherwise we are just stuck.
DeadBedrooms,ffk83cg,t1_ffjwapt,1580018510.0,"Thank you for your thoughtful response.  

What you suggest would work for me...but he hasn't been open to it this far.  Maybe explaining it differently (in therapy) will help."
DeadBedrooms,ffjuihv,t1_ffjja0v,1580007309.0,I've asked point blank if he finds me attractive.  And I've suggested that maybe an open relationship would be a good fit.  He says he does find me attractive and he doesn't want an open relationship.  Is there something else I could do or some other thing I should ask?
DeadBedrooms,ffjjeyq,t3_ets3gw,1579999575.0,Ugh I hate this feeling!  I hope he delivers on his promise!  Let us know how it goes!
DeadBedrooms,ffjitvu,t1_ffjd69z,1579999190.0,He hasn't been open to compromise this far.  He's not open to scheduling sex.  And he hasn't been interested in mutual masterbation (honestly I'm not into that either).
DeadBedrooms,ffjiq53,t1_ffjctwk,1579999120.0,"Good point.  I don't nag about it.  I don't get dramatic.  I don't threaten.  I do get sad or embarrassed when I get turned down.  I don't pull away from other types of physical affection that he does give (kisses, cuddling, etc).  I try not to make him feel inadequate though sometimes I wonder if thats the message coming across.  I suggested therapy and after a serious talk about this he agreed.  I know he doesn't love it but he shows up."
DeadBedrooms,ffjchji,t1_ffjc09y,1579995394.0,"We actually are kind of working on this.  Our last sex talk was a week or so before Xmas.  That is when I found out he materbatea regularly (I assumed he did but he confirmed).  I asked if masterbation was having an effect on his sex life.  He said he didn't think so but I asked him to experiment and he agreed.  No self pleasure for 30 days for him.  Problem is, he hasn't brought it up since that time and I'm afraid to.  So I don't know what happened...I'm not certain if he tried ..and if he did try I'm not sure how successful he was.  I know our sex life wasn't affected this past month or so.

We have a counseling appointment this week and I'm going to bring this is then.  I've decided to try and only have these talks in the counseling sessions to help mediate the discussion.

I don't want to dump him...we have a life together.  But I so want to find a solution."
healthyeating,ffgid0e,t1_fffnltx,1579906911.0,"Yeah I think you make some really good points... I intend to never have the same relationship with junk food that I used to.  It's no longer a main staple of my diet.  For me I think two things have triggered me to take this more seriously other than just getting older and having a harder time losing weight.
 
One of those things is my weigh itself. My mom was always heavy I remember her saying that 180 lb was the top weight she would ever put on her driver's license.  I have never been that heavy before but now that I am it really freaked me out.

And secondly is also fairly cosmetic. Most straight size women's clothing stores carry sizes up to 12 or 14.  At my ideal weight I'm still about a 10 in pants because I carry most of my weight in my hips.... But I've been in the 12 to 14 category for the last few years.  These days though the fourteens are beginning to get a little bit tight and I really don't want to have to shop in plus-size stores."
HLCommunity,fffx6ox,t3_eteoc7,1579893759.0,"Examples.  He needs examples.  Your dynamic with your partner sounds similar to mine in some ways.  And I've found two things to be helpful:

1) call it out in the moment...or shortly thereafter.  Notice one of these rollercoaster shifts with him?  Bring it up and point out how it seems to you and how you feel.  And then point it back to the intimacy issue 

2) when you talk bring up examples of times when you thought things were on one track then he switched it up on you.  If he's anything like my partner he will point out all the reasons that example isn't a good one bc ""I was sick that week"" or ""I was stressed"" or whatever else.  So have multiple examples at the ready and focus not on one specific instance but on the pattern and trend of things"
healthyeating,fffggol,t1_ffejdn3,1579883428.0,Thanks.  Keto/low carb are great.  But it's not sustainable for me.  In the past I would do hardcore for like a month....and then undo all that hard work in like two weeks.  Lol.  But I have been trying to back off the carbs a bit since they just seem to make me eat more
healthyeating,fffg7dn,t1_ffec4sq,1579883268.0,"I get this.  I think there's a part of me that doesn't like to be told what to do.  So if I say ""I'm only eating healthy foods this week"" the other side of my brain is like ""fuck you - you can't make me"".  Which I know sounds insane bc I'm just arguing with myself lol.

But if you had a restrictive diet for wrestling I can imagine you might feel like you don't want to be forced to eat a certain way like you did back then.  

I guess it's about reframing that no one is forcing us...it's only us Maki g choices for ourselves."
healthyeating,ffffwzq,t1_ffe3wyb,1579883091.0,"I love this response.  I think I've actually gotten better about recognizing the reasons I'm eating...at least with certain foods.  It's totally cliche but sometimes if I'm feeling down I'll be like ""time to take my medicine"" and eat some chocolate.  I'm still eating it and it's still not the best coping mechanism....but at least I'm aware of what I'm doing."
HLCommunity,ff65psw,t1_ff62k72,1579619765.0,Could be.  But he's even hesitant to have sex when he's been drinking
HLCommunity,ff65o7e,t1_ff5s8x5,1579619734.0,"No it was kind of like this early on.  But more noticeable when we moved in.  He has a very high stress and physically demanding job so he often claims he's too tired...and at first I believed him bc it made sense.

A few months in we took our first vacation together.  We got a romantic cabin and in advance of the trip he was talking about how much sex we were going to have.  And then we get there and....nothing.  we had a great time together but we only had sex once and it was at my very direct initiation.  I think that's where I realized there was a problem."
DeadBedrooms,fegluiz,t1_fefwlvw,1579096733.0,Thank you for this I've been struggling for the words and I think you just hit the nail on the head.
HLCommunity,feecc2p,t1_fdkt0ls,1579030830.0,"I've been mulling over this response for several days.  I really appreciate the thought and care that went into it.  Still kind of thinking it through but wanted to thank you for sending this,"
loveafterporn,fdt7y7w,t1_fds6qmf,1578713095.0,Best choice you could make
loveafterporn,fdpmr2m,t3_eml3eg,1578633051.0,"Are you seeing a counselor?  If not, please do.  This issues you are experiencing can be worked on but you need help to do so."
HLCommunity,fdkntmq,t1_fdklg3i,1578507439.0,"I guess I'm trying to find out concrete ways to disrupt the cycle.  I'm female with a male partner in case you think that's important (he's the LL).  Any insight?

I think initially I brushed it off as no big deal but over time the rejection hurt me and I felt undesirable (though never unloved).  The rejection led to ""big talks"" about the issue where we couldn't seem to get on the same page.  We still aren't but are in therapy so maybe that will help.  We currently have sex about once every month or two.  I would prefer 1-3 times a week."
sex,fdh2oun,t1_fdgjngj,1578414084.0,"This may sound naive but...how do you combine them?

He knows I have it but the vast majority of the time that I use it it's when he's not home or he's got headphones on.  I've used it one or twice with him but I'm not super comfy with that yet"
HLCommunity,fdf6s76,t1_fder94s,1578354614.0,This backfires thought bc men who feel controlled don't usually like their partners very much.  And they might even resist bc they don't like being told what to do
DeadBedrooms,fde4m9s,t1_fddsexa,1578331067.0,"The therapy thing was my line in the Sand.  I said I didn't know how we could move forward as a couple if we can't resolve this issue...and that we weren't resolving it on our own so therapy was my requirement.  Him agreeing to that shows me he valued me and the relationship even if we are on different pages in terms of sex.

What do you think his deal is?  

PS: I'm 35 too and it's a weird age...bc I'm realizing even more that I'm not ""young"" anymore"
healthyeating,fdcumop,t3_ejna4d,1578284783.0,This is a huge problem for me too.  Drinking water and snacking on veggies or fruit seems to be the only way I can avoid it.
EmotionalEating,fdcqs91,t1_fdckk3c,1578281721.0,"It is kind of inconsiderate, right?  Honestly this is something he does alot.  We'll be watching TV and he gets up to get a drink and never asks if I want one...I used to take offense.  And I kind of tried to ""train"" him to ask me.  It didn't really work though so I've just realized this is not part of his love language.  He shows love in other ways but ""acts of service"" isn't so high on his list I don't think.  

So...when you start to have those negative feelings and want to turn to food, do you find it's just a matter of stopping yourself and focusing on something else (art or exercise or whatever)?"
HLCommunity,fdcil5b,t1_fdcfubi,1578275800.0,Good to know - I'd never heard of that
EmotionalEating,fdcihlk,t1_fdbu4rr,1578275731.0,"It was definitely the feeling of rejection.  Him not considering my needs or desires with making the drink...and again with wanting to play games instead of stay with me.  

I think one thing that I probably need to work on is not being ashamed of the feelings I have.  He's a great partner in many ways and very kind and I guess I feel guilty when I question that.  Like ""how dare I feel rejected by him when we just had a great day together""

But, yes, I guess it's just about finding something else.  Exercises is great and sometimes I can do that....maybe k can do that more often"
DeadBedrooms,fdauc59,t3_eka95l,1578250274.0,"I think maybe you've just unlocked a kink he has but never realized or didn't want to admit.  This could actually be a good thing for your relationship.

You fucked up, yes, but you didn't physically cheat.  It happened and he knows about it and it can't be undone.  Forgive yourself and use this as a learning opportunity and opportunity to improve your sex life with your husband.

My situation is somewhat similar in some ways and I've often wondered if there is some kink that would being his libido and mine more into alignment.  I'll be curious what your therapists say...."
HLCommunity,fd7ebsx,t1_fd7dqz6,1578203137.0,I hope so.  Hoping counseling will help.  I really love him...but sex is important to me.
HLCommunity,fd77ssd,t1_fd77ght,1578200552.0,Yup.  But I can only control myself.  I can't control him or his choices
getdisciplined,fd74av4,t3_ek701g,1578199248.0,"I like to sort of make it a game.  For me there are certain things I'm trying to do daily (like drink a certain amount of water) and certain things that are weekly (working out 4 days a week or not having more than 3 sodas a week).

I draw or use a calendar and do certain stickers for each item completed.  That way I can track my progress and see where I'm at at a glance.  

It's great to have a big goal but I personally find big goals more overwhelming and sometimes we just loose our oomph.  So I really like to focus more on the smaller steps within the big goal.  

For me, losing weight is the big goal...but I'd rather focus on drinkinf more water, working out, and limiting unhealthy foods and drinks."
HLCommunity,fd6rixi,t1_fd6ox2a,1578194834.0,"I don't think he would do it.  He would probably laugh awkwardly.  He doesnt like to feel used or coerced into having sex...he wants it to be when we both desire it and it can be special.

We have a great relationship in many ways and I believe in working on a relationship before giving up.  There is also a possibility that porn has made it difficult for him to have a ""normal"" sex life...so that's something we are beginning to explore.

I get the cringey-ness...but in the context of the discussion and what I know about him it makes sense.  He has a belief that sex often ruins a relationship so he's hesitant to try things that could jeopardize the other aspects of the relationship.  

I don't necessarily agree with him but I am trying to understand.  And we've recently started counseling so maybe that will help."

HLCommunity,fcz0it2,t3_ejl5kp,1578091194.0,"I haven't had a chance to read all the other comments yet but I really think this is an interesting and important concept. I remember when I first started college and was trying to make new friends. I wasn't really into the drinking and partying thing like a lot of other people in my dorm so I found making friends a little challenging. there were these two girls in my dorm that I became a little friendly with. They asked me once to go out with them to a bar and I declined... And then maybe a week or so later they asked again.  I remember thinking to myself that I didn't really want to go to the bar but that I wanted opportunities to make friends and if I turn them down again they probably wouldn't ask a third time.  I've kept this rule pretty much my whole life when it comes to social engagement. Unless I legitimately have a conflict I try not to say no invitations twice in a row.  And on the flip side when someone turns me down twice in a row I usually assume they are not interested in spending time with me and tend to stop inviting them to do anything frequently.

It's talked about a lot here but it's not the rejection that is a problem it's the pattern of rejection."
