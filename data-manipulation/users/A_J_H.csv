wholesomememes,fececbg,t3_eo7w89,1578971893.0,I went to a wedding January 3rd and since then I've been unbearably depressed and i don't know what to do. I'm turning 35 this year and I'm still single and I feel sad and pathetic because i haven't met anyone yet while all my closest friends are married or getting married. Anyway I just needed to get that out.

AskReddit,fcu8ok9,t3_eixc75,1577975182.0,It hasn't. I've tried it for years and years. It's a vicious cycle where i use it because I'm lonely and want to try to find someone and then nothing happens from it so i get incredibly discouraged and convinced I'm not good looking enough and uninstall everything only to go back a few months later.
