depression,ffygvb2,t1_ffxx3fk,1580346119.0,All that shopping I did the past year... The temporary feelings of joy and novelty the items brought were so short-lived. At least they were items I did really want and few I thought I needed..
depression,ffygnkh,t1_ffx1cun,1580345972.0,Then OP will just be depressed in cowboy boots AND cowboy hat.
ADHD,ffygka7,t1_ffxzu2j,1580345910.0,Yup.. Just when you feel like having to deal with ADHD is hellish enough (along with depression/anxiety that is co-morbid) and then you got the fact that there are people who deny it even exists.. It's sad when even ADHD sufferers second-guess themselves and are in denial due to this. I still have moments like this with my diagnosis.
ADHD,ffyg8vu,t1_ffxoanl,1580345691.0,"They started cutting off disability benefits for so many people in Ontario the past few years ever since Doug Ford planned to cut $1B from social services. It's a hassle for a normally functioning person to do all that paperwork back and forth let alone someone who is disabled, struggles with energy, motivation etc. and struggles to take care of him or herself."
depression,ffwgeem,t3_evl38q,1580300074.0,"Holy crap. You remind me of myself except I'm 10 years older than you and still struggling with depression. Kind of going through an episode rn.. Like a very low low... Having a lot of resentment towards others now instead of just feeling shame.. Been having suicidal thoughts lately because living just seems like a pain and there's no joy in anything, really.. I stopped having ""hobbies"" and just go on here or YouTube. That's the most I can do to distract my own self.

I genuinely hope things get better for you eventually even if it's a tiny bit improvement..."

ADHD,fft29sv,t3_euzzx6,1580203199.0,"Well, that's good to hear. That's definitely much better than having one that calls you ""ADHD motherf*cker"" when you get into a fight. He's my ex now so no more dealing with that. He used to say things like ""For someone smart, you're stupid"" and ""How can you be so passive?"" and also say I act like a kid and get too enthusiastic about things... ""so blind and unaware of your surroundings"""

ADHD,ffhdqun,t1_ffhcj4x,1579931129.0,"Aw.. Thank you. It means a lot to me to hear that. 2019 was a horrible year for me and I was extremely depressed and stressed over the summer when he lost his vision. It was hard for ME to adapt to that but he seemed to handle it way better than I could ever. It amazes me how quickly dogs can adapt and still be joyful..

Thank you for the suggestion. I will definitely look into that more!"
ADHD,ffgvja5,t1_ffgqyt8,1579916136.0,"Yeah.. Very good doggo :( but he went blind last year so I gotta guide him more and he is more likely to have accidents due to that. His sense of ""time"" changed somehow. Idk how to explain it but he'll communicate with me more through growls and whining noises since he can't see to get my attention. I also gotta talk to him more than before. He finds puppy pads to use most of the time so he is well trained. *sigh* He seems happy and wags his tail a lot just from hearing my voice. I feel bad."

I have tried Vyvanse, Dexedrine, Biphentin, Adderall XR.. All started in May. I still have a couple of pills left of antidepressants like Citalopram and Bupropion XL but I haven't taken them either for awhile now. I haven't made an appointment with my psych to get refill on Adderall or to address the anxiety problems the past months. I had a couple of panic attacks in the Fall and it just scared me from wanting to do anything (go out/work/school). I just felt too ashamed for some reason.. that I can't even go.. and just drained.. because I dropped out of last semester's course. I was too anxious so I couldn't focus (and ofc ADHD just made things worse in general) and became unmotivated (depression kicking in harder) and just got too overwhelmed from the stress both physically and mentally. I don't understand how people can just go to work and interact with people all the time let alone work while in school... AND have a social life. I basically avoid people now as much as I can including family and friends."

I don't know if I should try it again. I got so sick and fed up of the side effects and the physical anxiety from it.... loss of appetite. But it's like such an extreme on either end because I either binge eat when I'm not on meds or I don't eat at all..... There is never an in-between with anything. I don't know what to do.

How do you expect a kid to know what they want to do in the future.... At least I didn't and felt like I had to make up an answer so I didn't feel left out. I never realized a lot of things like that from when I was a kid was partly attributed to this stupid ADHD. Even now.. all grown up and hearing people ask school and career questions makes me cringe.... I think I know part of the reason I avoid friends and family a lot.. Because of the shame of not being ""productive"" in life and ""doing something"". Everything just feels like it has to be forced.. Everything that I do....

ADHD,feqg495,t3_eqakqn,1579341428.0,"Wow, I feel you... I feel exactly the same way. The only thing different for me is I didn't go to college or university straight out of high school... My mental health was just too poor and I was in a deep depression and suicidal at the time. I ended up just working random, odd jobs before I eventually went back to the school environment. I really hate that our value is based on our productivity too.. And I am introverted so interactions with people drain the hell out of me. I can't keep doing this. I find it more traumatizing than rewarding as well... I love nature and the wilderness so I want to do the same thing as you.. There is just nothing rewarding or nothing that makes all this BS seem worth it... People always say to get a planner and use a calendar blah blah but I'll start using it for a few months and then stop. I just hate how everything has to be scheduled, planned.. has to have a deadline.. numbers, clocks.. alarms.. mealtime..."

It's called Darkness by Eminem and when I saw alcohol in the video.. I thought about how I used to drink that to help me calm my mind down aside from numbing emotions.. And then I thought about how I used to drink a glass of whisky to help me concentrate, read and study. =/ If I didn't, I would've just been too anxious to focus but I stopped drinking because the long-term side effects were just not worth the few good effects I got out of it.. It just made my anxiety worse after. I don't know how to help myself now.. The side effects of meds just makes me go crazy so I stopped.. I just wish people didn't make you feel like your value or worth as a person is measured by your productivity and that your success is measured by your money and relationships with people... because I am clearly poor at managing those...

Also, I just noticed your username is ""snailknife"". I wonder what inspired that username.. I used to have pet snails. lol This makes me think of snails that are able to crawl over knives and not get hurt because of the slime that protects them.  


I think Magnesium Citrate (powder form in drink) helped me somewhat... to relax enough to focus. =/"
ADHD,fep5vzg,t3_eq5zob,1579312827.0,"Not sure if that would work for me especially with my anxiety and depression. The depression is the part that makes it hardest with motivation and energy and then anxiety is the part that has me avoiding things left and right and pushing it until the very end.. So instead of procrastinating for say 7 hours now it would be like procrastinating for 14 hours. The extra down time for recharging would be nice though... since having ADHD, anxiety, and being introverted makes me constantly exhausted."

ADHD,fem0pux,t1_fekocof,1579236022.0,"This was me and the snowball effect in school.. I would get so mentally exhausted and if I couldn't sustain the focus.. well.. it just gets worse and worse and the anxiety adds up and I end up dropping everything. It just gets to the point where I physically feel sick.. my stomach, my head, everything.. I knew it wasn't normal to be getting tension headaches all the time from trying to read a textbook and then feeling like puking the more I force myself to study. Or is that supposed to be normal 'cause you know.. school is supposed to be stressful, right? Apparently being stressed out makes people seem more productive and makes it seem like they're hard-working members of society who study and work hard.

ADHD,fem0bis,t1_fek6oc2,1579235689.0,"Tell me about it.. And it's so mentally draining and exhausting that I feel like doing just one thing in one day is already taking so much effort and a huge accomplishment for me... if I manage to even get it done. Like all I did today was clean my drawers out and wipe down the tabletop when in the back of my mind.. I knew I had to start reading, learning, and studying a textbook. I felt so much anxiety from just the thought of it.. I don't get how people can just ease through tasks. It's just so uncomfortable to wake up every day.. and not look forward to the day because everything gives me anxiety.. at least things that are considered ""productive"". Doing something ""unproductive"" is just a way to escape and avoid the anxiety but then the guilt from that just leads to more anxiety. Then when I actually am able to START something, I can't sustain the focus and if I force myself ... I just get tension headaches. I am also too anxious to go out but I know I have to..."

Already two weeks into the semester and I already have to play ""catch up"" from missed lectures due to anxiety. I can't believe this."
ADHD,felzhox,t3_epj8gd,1579234994.0,That's me right now. I stayed up all night and then passed out during the day. Missed my class. I haven't opened my Chemistry textbook and started reading it yet and we're already two weeks into the semester. I already skipped the last few lectures in the evening because of my anxiety. My stomach felt sick while I sat in the very first lecture.. How am I going to survive in this world... let alone enjoy life? The thought of all the money going down the drain makes me even more anxious. Learning isn't even enjoyable anymore when so many things are based off of performance and it's hard to self regulate in regards to ANYTHING.
ADHD,felz15d,t3_epq1p7,1579234614.0,"I feel sad.. I'm majoring in Biology and forced to take Chemistry and Math classes. I was able to ace my first Chem course (went from almost failing with one prof to switching to another the next semester with a much better, spaced out schedule) but I keep dropping out of semesters from anxiety. A big part of the anxiety is not being able to focus to learn and then actually study.. and then it becomes a snowball effect. :( This is harder with classes I have zero interest but need to move on.. So many things are based off of performance and I just feel like post secondary education is not rewarding at all....... The thought of 'oh I need this degree so I can get a career and survive' isn't very motivating to me since I am already severely depressed. It's not even to live and enjoy life but just to survive these days.. I stopped taking meds for over a month now too.. because I can't stand the side effects. I just hate how being alive is not enjoyable and there is no purpose to anything. I just feel like crying."
Anxiety,felyarw,t1_feluqos,1579234034.0,I never thought of that.. Good idea. Smartphones and apps weren't really a big thing back then. Damn.. That's how long ago this was.
Anxiety,felmwqo,t3_epnec0,1579225999.0,Damn.. I need to do it just like you... I'm 30 now. I failed my first writing test because I was just in the worst depressive state ever and could not focus/study anything. I was also being forced to write it. I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD back then either.. That was when I was around 17 or 18.. I haven't written a driving test again since then because of my fear of failure. I also have anxiety just thinking about driving... But the only real reason I want to get my license is to be able to go on roadtrips to escape the city... and I guess incase of an emergency where it would be very helpful if I knew how to operate a vehicle.
Anxiety,fejnznn,t3_epgmr1,1579181221.0,I don't like the way it was worded (it does give off an undermining vibe).. but there are times I somehow feel comforted by listening to a 'sad song' or 'depressing song' because I can relate to it. Music speaks to you.. Sometimes I am not in the mood or can't get myself to listen to music or anything at all and just listen to silence.. Other times I would have a song on repeat. People tend to gravitate towards things they understand and there is something weirdly comforting about delving into the 'depressing' stuff sometimes. I think it's because you're so used to being in a depressed state that you don't know how else to feel or you can't feel anything else.. and you're afraid of change and can't imagine being in a different state. I get what you're trying to say with the whole misconception with the terms and definitions and mental health but clinical depression can be seen and dealt with differently among individuals..
Anxiety,fejm5gt,t1_fejgyz1,1579179556.0,Don't you just miss the ol' days when people used to invite you in person or by calling you on the phone? Oh wait.. I don't think I miss much of anything 'cause any kind of invitation still makes me anxious anyway..
Anxiety,fejm12s,t3_epe6k3,1579179442.0,I rarely ever check newsfeed whether it's on IG or FB... I usually just post my own random crap without caring about what other people post... But just knowing that people have 'access' to me makes my anxiety skyrocket.. like in messenger. I wish there was a way to just deactivate WhatsApp so that people can't even message you even after you deleted the app..
starterpacks,feipttv,t3_ep7mnr,1579144220.0,It was the opposite for me while my friend stayed over.. I offered my bed for my friend while I slept on the floor. I used my sleeping bag.. There was a guest room but she wanted to sleep in the same room as me so it feels more like a slumber party lol
ADHD,feiof4t,t3_ep9ebk,1579143271.0,"Yes and this is how I ended up falling behind and dropping out of semesters constantly.. I tried so hard only for my brain to fight me and it caused not only mental exhaustion but translated to physical symptoms too such as tension headaches and feeling like puking from forcing myself to study... That is just from trying to read.. Can you imagine after that.. just trying to understand the material and MEMORIZE things and practice problems? Like it's already a problem from the start... Actually, it's already a problem before even reading the textbook because I have to even make it somehow to that point where I'm not distracted and open it to start the task.. It's even more frustrating when you know the subject is actually interesting to you...

I remember going to my disability counselor at school one time and told her this and I asked her ""Is this what the learning experience is supposed to be like in university? Is it supposed to be that stressful all the time that you get tension headaches and feel like puking when trying to read?"" She told me that's not normal.. She acknowledged my ADHD problem though.. I mean.. She was the one that suggested it and even told me her husband suffers from it as well.."
