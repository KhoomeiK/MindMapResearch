nutrition,feairpl,t3_eo9a7e,1578949340.0,"I thought I had IBS my whole life. Stomach cramps, Diarrhea, restless legs (i'll explain) Been to doctors who prescribed me many different IBS meds. No one could fix it. Cut out dairy cause it got worse after pizza. Didn't fix anything. Just figured I was broken and had to deal with the pain and constant bathroom visits. After 20 years of this BS I randomly asked my doctor for an allergy test because I now have kids who have allergies. Surprise, I'm allergic to wheat. Gluten is the protein in wheat. It's higher in heavy breads like pizza dough (which I freaking love!). So now I eat gluten free aka wheat free and all is good. Also slipped up and had wheat once, and I hadn't even noticed until that night that my restless legs syndrome had been gone because it came back that night real bad. Turns out, there's a link."

LifeProTips,fdn7goa,t1_fdlim4k,1578579364.0,"Sorry for your loss. CPR would not have helped your friend, BUT this is a good example of why people need to actually take a hands on CPR class. In an emergency you will do what you have physically done in the past, not what your non emergency brain knows you should do. Your brain starts frantically searching for past events that fit the current one. This is why people say their life ""flashes before their eyes"" during extreme events. This is also why people tend to freeze up if they cannot find a similar event. It's not your fault, it's human nature. You cannot change what happened, but you can try to act differently in the future. Take a CPR class, try to bring some friends, and keep practicing it."
LifeProTips,fdn28eb,t1_fdmopov,1578575084.0,Also that 10% is only in people with shock-able rhythms. Which is in itself a low percentage of cardiac arrests. Same goes for the 50% in systems with high civilian CPR/AEDs and fast response times. It's 50% of people in V-fib or V-tach. They aren't saving 50% of people who die.

howto,fczommw,t3_ejjb5t,1578105788.0,"Consider getting low cost health insurance ( high deductible), even if for only a month. Most insurance pays 100% of preventive medicine. Vaccines are preventive. I went through my county clinic in the past for vaccines, it was still hundreds of dollars. You can also check local “free” clinics. They usually have sliding scale payments based on income."

nextfuckinglevel,fcffrd3,t1_fccoxuv,1577629540.0,"Because break ups aren't always mutual or amiable. Also feelings and sexual relations can (and usually do) continue long after people have ""broken up"". I'm guessing you've never been in a serious relationship? Typically if you have loved someone, when the other person finds someone new, you feel something."

BrandNewSentence,fc5ui93,t3_eg3umy,1577466178.0,"I had a boss that gave me the ""eyes"" every time I said bye at 6 pm. Stare, pause, wide eyes - no blinking, then ... okay bye. Sometimes I didn't stay to hear his goodbye. Side note: same guy was currently being sued by a former employee for unpaid overtime, probably why he never forced the issue. I hear he lost the suit and had to pay big time. Everyone should do this if they are forced to work for free, it will benefit more than just you and it may change the culture of these entitled CEO/bosses."

There are no laws against lying to patients if you’re intent is to find out the truth. Is it morally wrong, probably, but not illegal.  The reason I can’t be bothered to google it is because you’re clearly wrong. I was just helping you to realize it. I regret that now. Carry on with your ignorance. Also, you’re rude. This talk is over. Good day."
