worldnews,ffc1tap,t1_ffbx53v,1579789392.0,"They have to fly low to put out the fire in smokey conditions.  The aircraft are heavy with water and probably not that maneuverable.  They are flying through rising columns of superheated air.

One of the reasons commercial aircraft fly so high (besides fuel efficiency) is to give the pilots time to fix anything that goes wrong.  If the engine goes out, you got time to fix the issue or at least choose a nice field to crash land in."
bestof,ffa1yyd,t1_ff9v9h2,1579726267.0,"Our current radio telescopes are not powerful  enough to detect earth like radio signals from the next nearest star.  

We can only detect the largest gravitational waves, like 2 black holes colliding. 

While an advanced civilization could broadcast much stronger signals than we do, it's not a guarantee that they would, or that we know what to look for if they did."
bestof,ff922dt,t1_ff7si8l,1579702917.0,"Or because radio waves loose power with the square of the distance they travel, and a thousand light years squared would make the signals too faint to pick up over the noise of the star."

science,ff85miw,t1_ff84mb7,1579666646.0,"Capitalism is just an optimization algorithm. 
 There are some things it works for, and some it doesn't.

 Distribution of non neccesary small goods where you have other options it works well for.  

Things where you die if you don't purchase it, things that must be done for large numbers of people, and things they cannot tell you the price of are all bad fits for that particular algorithm.  

Just imagine if the Russians invaded your lawn, you called your private army you pay monthy, and they did not cover Russian invasions because they are out of network.  It doesn't work as efficiently as just all being in the same pot."

sciencefiction,ff2zybc,t1_ff2gnr2,1579529925.0,"What if I tell you the movie cut out the final battle where the hobbits show off what they learned?  and cut out the most powerful good guy they meet?

Overall, the movies worked well for me.  But I totally understand why some people would have issue.

Whenever you switch mediums, you need to alter the story a bit.  
Some elements like internal dialogs of characters don't work as well as they do in books.  Also explainations of long histories.  These are things that Dune has a lot of, which is why people are worried.

Things like color, visuals, mood, and particularly music work well in movies though.  I was particularly impressed with soundtrack and the insertion of the battle in the beginning of LotR.  

The real question in my mind, is will they be able to tell that story while keeping the feel, and even expanding on it? 

I'm cautiously optimistic."

science,feuv60p,t1_fet9nh5,1579390290.0,"Capitalism doesn't work if you can't see the prices.

Go call any hospital and ask them how much to have a baby, and they won't give you a straight answer.  You are unable to make a financially responsible decision in that environment.  With that being the case, no one has the incentive to charge reasonable fees.

Single payer is the way.  The safe birth of a child should be the first gift of a society to it's newest citizen."
bestof,fess1mx,t1_fespe95,1579368423.0,"This is the kind of weaponized misogyny mentality being bred in the conservative safe spaces of the internet.

And this is the same tactic they used last time.

It's meant to convince you that life is a zero sum game.  Where if someone else loses then you automatically win.  The only way to win is make others lives more miserable than your own. 

 That's not how a country should work.  We can achieve more through working to make life better for us all than we can dragging eachother down."

 Never got as bad as Germany did, but they never got to our shores.  If the east coast had been invaded and we were under direct threat then I wonder what it would have been like."
Kotlin,feglzsh,t3_ep1pkd,1579096848.0,"Kotlin is great for server side.  

For clis though, many devops guys don't want to rely on having a jvm installed.  Kotlin gives you the option to compile natively, but I would be concerned that you would have fewer command line libraries than go."

worldnews,fdndezm,t1_fdn3ukf,1578583420.0,"Yeah, no matter where you make it, it will have some pollution.

The best solution is just buy less.  Ask yourself if you really need that thing in your Amazon cart.  Use that money to pay off your debts or build some savings.   If you do need one, then look at responsible sourcing.


Reduce, reuse, recycle in that order."

My guess is making it go out to every subburb would increase the scope more than the city was willing to fund, and you still would need to travel from your house to the  station in the Minnesotan winter.  Are there any proposals to expand it?"
