I know it is hard for teachers to ""get real"" with kids - but we know what life is like out there for homeless teens and runaways.  My teacher knew there was really no place for me to go.

My family fed me, clothed me, housed me, and though the abuse was mainly mental abuse and religous/cult abuse from my church life (very underlying abusive - no ritual torture or anything)

So I held on.  And as soon as I graduated, I left.  I used all my skills of survival I learned dealing with my parents to get out into the world and make my own life.  I've never been quite right, but I am trying to move on.  After 35 years it seems a distant memory, but still effects me deep in my core.  Meds help immensely.

Just be real with teens in crisis.

If you know they'd be fresh meat out in the real world if they ran away - tell them.  If you know they aren't in imminent physical harm, tell them they can make it and survive.  If you live in a place where LGTBQIA people can be murdered or disappeared - tell them to wait to come out till they are 18 and get out of there, then go to place where they can be themselves.

Be real with kids.  Be honest.  And remember the world is not a safe place - so sometimes you have to chose the next safest place to survive.  Sometimes that means joining the military to get your needs met.  Sometimes that means going to college.  Other times that means taking jobs with residential housing like conference centers or camp counseling.

Is the main site - I just want to give you this advice - the website is OLD!

So what you do is make a master application, then you find the job you want, then you use the master application to apply for it (the buttons are confusing.) Then at that point you can answer the supplemental questions or you'll be directed to take a entry test or you'll just be applied.

So make your cover letter count!  Submit only pdfs and always include a cover letter with at least two paragraphs, edited, and properly formatted.

I can tell you HR people like me sort through these aps with extreme cruelty.  We don't really care about anything you did (depending on the job) if you send us a garbage resume, no cover letter, or something that seems to be written by a fifth grader.  

Even if you are applying for a trades skill job - just keep it simple, but have a friend who writes well give it eyeball or go through Grammarly.   It also helps to have a friend to frame your resume for the job, even if it is a forklift driver.

It is also really important to overestimate your skills on the online applications for the state and places like OU.  The computer will screen you out if you  have to honestly say no to any of the specific questions in an ap.  And if you rank yourself low, it will push you down in the list of applicants.

So if you know how to write a Word doc - EXPERT. You can learn everything else on youtube if it comes up.

(as another tip - any jobs on [jobs.ou.edu](https://jobs.ou.edu) that are in Oklahoma City (not OUHSC) or are offered by the Office of Public Management are STATE contract jobs.  OU runs half the DHS offices and CS jobs for the state on contract.  These are GREAT entry level jobs.  While the pay is low, you will get benefits, you have a strict schedule, and they keep it fun. You will also learn vital skills how the state infrastructure works and how to get your foot in the door for the state or OU.

You need a credit card, credit, and a bank account and I am sure it seems ludricous to people who never struggled or do not live in rural Alaska, but must of the world can't access streaming tv.

Much of China still use internet cafes because of those reasons alone.

I can afford streaming. I also was there when Hulu was free and Justin.tv had free streams of users with 1000s of kinds of content. No one died because of the creative commons. And no one list that much money when GenX people like me dropped cable. (Which was easier since since internet came seperately from local providers)

 However, this means a huge chunk of our  people are missing out on formative shared experiences which further separate the haves from the have nots. Just remember how Star Trek launched Whoopi Goldbergs career as a child or Mae Jamison's career as an astronaut.  How many kids out there NEED that push?

(Like Picard and Janeway drew me toward leadership and management roles in Stem)

And I think having the shared experience of watching all previous Star Treks in TV is what made us a fan community of diverse people for around the world.

CBS had one, now two Star Trek shows and the rest I could care less for. Netflix has every series and they have the best selection at sci fi and fantasy.

I caught up on Discovery in the EU because their Netflix had it.  I liked it, but not enough to go back running three streaming services plus my mno sub (which is 24 a day interactive tv show basically that I can always enjoy as long as I want.) That costs the same as a cable bill.

I am a busy professional with an active job. I don't have enough time to binge watch TV, but for things like this it's almost mandatory.  So I wait till everything; is out, pause one sub, and pick up another like for a show like Game of Thrones.

Long ago we used bitorrent. I feel like this does a disservice to the actors and creators plus viruses and malware are more complex and easy to hide. I also don't like using public internet to do it. Sure I could get a VPN, but again just another sub to pay.

Netflix and Hulu had a great idea, but everyone else just wants to bring back that sweet, no control cable TV money they loose everytime a boomers dies.  And that is often and they were their core demo.

So problem 1 - I grew up around Hollywood ppl and my uncle is a well known dude (in the industry so not famous). Like I said above they will want their yoga, smoothies, and organic chicken.

They also love to exploit, I mean make money, when they see an opportunity like a place where you can buy massive amounts of land for 1k to 9k an acre. Or a fully equipped cattle ranch of 150 for 445k. They will get all excited  buy up the land, then basically start gentrification.  It so tempting when a normal, 2 bd in LA sells for 400-500k.

I did a drive around my new home yesterday. Much of the town of, like where I grew up, is falling apart. Houses are rotting mostly and nice houses are rare, grouped up, or on the outskirts.  People are barely getting by and they cant do upkeep.

So if they turn this place into Aspen,Ok or Whitefish, OK, people will benefit from the service jobs no doubt after the movie jobs leave. And the Drummond's will have the whole downtown matching their daughter's Pioneer Woman shops and hotels.

Except no one wants the regular people (Osage ppl most of all) priced out of town, their rents suddenly raised, or the whole place bought up so suddenly people like me who get paid less than a city teacher for our good work won't be able to save up to buy a ranch.

So I hope the City officials are going to keep a close eye on this. Money is so tasty. That is what this movie is about.  If landlords get greedy, start evicting people to rent to Hollywood types, or raise their rents it is going disenfranchise middle-low income families who have been here for generations.

I can say I am lucky that I made friends with a few key local people who helped me find a good house for a good price and nice landlords.  When I was trying before via the Internet it was impossble since most nice places are AirBnB, VRBO, or bed and breakfasts.  The kids at the Merchantile said they had to live out of town even though they wanted to live close to work.

This ain't LA and I hope it never gets to be like Aspen or Whitefish.  Rich people things are nice, like a chai and that P-Town steak pizza, but not gentrification.

Restricted eating is followed by bingeing and the less of a balanced diet a person gets the more they binge on food to compensate.  The steak thing is a textbook example.  Dude is hungry, is not getting the nutrients he needs from his version of the keto diet, and finds himself ravenous enough to binge publicly on your food.

So you are dealing with a starving animal and just like anyone who practices a diet without researching how to balance those vital nutrients to keep the brain and body going  (or researching about ODing on foods that normally keep the body going - like the heavy fat in Keto) your friend needs a balanced diet.

I believe that poor people should be able to use their EBT to buy an energy drink or specific ""healthy"" or ""junk"" foods at they see fit and their culture dictates or is available in their location or food that they will be able to prepare and cook with their circumstances (such as shelf-stable foods for the homeless.)

A can of Starbucks double shot espresso is $2.50 at the gas station ($2 for 4 at 711 usually) and if you buy it in a four pack about $1.25

If you buy a used espresso machine for 4.99 at the thrift store or buy a stovetop European espresso pot for 12-20$:

One package of Cafe Bustello from Aldi is $3.98.  There is 40 shots of espresso in that package if you make it yourself.   If you buy milk or soy milk - another 2-3$

If you like flavors: bottle of Torani ranges from 2.99 to 8.99

(You can also use that package of Cafe Bustello to make a strong cold brew infusion overnight)

If I plan ahead I can make a double-shot espresso latte for under 50 cents.  I will always have it in my house.  I can make a bunch and chill it for each day.

If I don't plan ahead for future me - I can spend $3-$5 to have that same quality double shot latte NOW or I can get the cold version for $2 at the 711.

**The lesson is to get out of the impulse buying  mentality (and the rush of throwing care to the wind) and start taking care of ""future you""   Which means dropping the generational poverty behavior which over a repetition of the same behavior creates debt. So the practice of planning ahead is a practice of planning ahead for a sustainable life where a trip to the dentist or a vital medication is more of a future priority than the present need for a 4$ latte five times a week.**

FanFiction,fewo3pv,t3_eqsc8y,1579416660.0,"It really is immaturity as a writer to fall back on a trope because it assumes too many things:

1. Virginity is a spiritual state and the act of putting an penis in a vagina is magical and transformative.
2. Putting a penis in a vagina is the most life-changing experience you'll ever have
3. Despite the reported ""force"" one has to use to put a penis in a vagina, it is still supposed to be the most awesome experience someone will ever have - even if it is tremendously painful due to a careless person forcing themselves w/o properly preparing their partner through proper foreplay and using lube. 
4. It will 'feel"" better suddenly after being ripped or forced and suddenly it will become the  most life changing experience ever. 
5. There is some sort of weird male fetish of being ""the first"" and it stems from IF they are the first and claim that woman - they'll never know how terrible (or what size they are) compared to any other male.  It stems from an early worry that a man's child is not his own. They say it wasn't an issue when humans lived communally in ancient times without political hierarchies and also didn't really get how babies were made biologically. 

Reality - for heterosexual intercourse it is putting a penis in a vagina for the first time.  And that is it.  No magical transformation. No edicts from God's wrath. The only consequence are biological (as getting pregnant or a disease) and sociology-political (as in being ostracized or lauded by your community for sticking a penis in a vagina or rarely, getting a penis stuck in your vagina.) 

Erotic fiction is naturally a fantasy, but people are just being extremely boring when they rewrite the same old scene every paperback romance novel has over and over again since the rise of the explicit bodice-ripper genre in the 60s.

And it is even MORE boring when people who've never had sex write to fetishize things they've never experienced but can imagine doing from reading other people who have never had sex(s) assumptions what that experience is like.  It builds tropes on tropes of misinformation based on crap lit and porn.

TwoXChromosomes,fetycot,t3_eqhi8w,1579381269.0,"Do what you can to survive. I have a friend who had the problem of getting pregnant nearly everytime she was fertile.  I rode out her chosen pregnancy with her and watching her nearly die was terrible.  At one point her kidneys shut down and she started to turn green.  She was green and dying.  She made it on bed rest and hospitalization (ruining her wish for a home water birth with her doula but oh well) THEN as soon as the baby was born she developed severe post-partum depression.  At first it was manically obessing about the baby and letting no one see him or touch him or give her break, then suddenly she broke down and didn't want him at all.  At that point her husband called in the friends and family to help her and we had an intervention.

She was still extremely sick and the post-partum was just part of that.  So when she chose sterilization - she did it to live.  Sadly though, previous to that she had four early abortions, suggested by her doctor so she didn't die and the fetuses didn't die as well.

It is a hard call, but you don't feel bad about living for you and your current child.  No one wants you to die and take the fetus with you leaving your family behind. 

As for your previous surgery, sue the ass off that doctor. They FAILED in their work by not giving you a pregnancy test before the surgery (I assume) and to somehow miss while (I assume) giving you a tubal ligation that you were indeed pregnant.  That is medical malpractice at is worst."

I say don't judge your parents too harshly.  Parents love their children in different ways and they were fond of your sister.  Your perception is they favored her for some reason and they may not realize their behavior or how your sister's behavior effected you.  

However, offering them two choices was an excellent way to determine what they really wanted.   You made the effort and they refused.

I have had several surgeries in the last three years and my ""after death plan"" was specific to do so - donate my organs - send my brain to Harvard for their studies of my brain's condition, and the rest to medical research.

I understand that Red Rock is for crisises, but the thought of my family member being in there with people having violent delusions and hurting themselves and others, plus very physical staff interventions is scary.  I know this is probably not the norm there - because people never tell stories about a regular day, but still even this small hospital had her on eight drugs and provided no real therapy before they released her.

The problem is, when kids have health issues, and she's a pretty girl, those crumb-bums and jerks always seem to be magnetically drawn to her wherever she is.

So far:

1. I have developed a shopping addiction which I am trying to curb. I never had shoes or clothes that fit me or that were new so when I started on a professional salary it was hard to resist looking nice in nice clothes at work.
2. BUT I still cheap out on things like my hair, makeup, and nails. My colleagues who grew up better always have perfect, styled hair, fancy nails, and expensive, well-applied makeup. No matter what I do, unless I put on a wig, I just can't look like that without dropping 150-300$ on a professional and I STILL Feel like I am being cheated.
3. I had to learn to not save food at professional events. Sounds odd right? I finally had my moment at a team meeting at a Marriot Hotel catered lunch where I couldn't finish my chicken wrap, so I wrapped it up in a big napkin, and stuck in my bag for later (so I didn't have to buy dinner on my per diem) When I looked up everyone was staring at me and I realized, for the first time, no one else really ever did that at these things.
4. I had to learn how to build credit and manage credit. Like use travel cards, get reimbursements, do complex math, budgets, and really curb impulse purchases AND plan and save for emergencies.
5. I had to learn to not talk about my windfalls or financial success with family because they will show up immediately with hands out. That is poverty culture. So as all my colleagues say pay the bills - never hand people cash.
6. I had to learn that when my car broke, my cat got sick, or I got sick, I could entirely go to get those fixed right away. The initial horror of the event was hard and the feeling I was about to be cheated hard to curb, but it was nice to accept security.
7. I had to learn to change the way I communicate. Poor people like to tell long, cyclical stories that feature every aspect and factor into an event. This is cool for problem solving, but no so much for small talk or workshops or meetings. So I had to (and still work on) developing a very shallow, professional set of banter and acceptable stories that don't reveal my different background.
8. As above, I met a Black gentleman who had gotten a prestigious internship with Goldman Sachs. He told us that he felt he really had to suppress who he was, despite he was a financial genius and amazing at his work, because the people who he was in the program with and the mentors he had ZERO context for his previous life and culture. Between navigating Black people stereotypes to trying to negotiating not sacrificing his uniqueness to become ""White"" he found it really hard to make it. As a low-income, first-gen woman from a rural background in the professional world OR working with highly-affluent donors or board members, I found myself in the same spot. You focus a ton on the present, experiences, and your academic/professional stuff, but anecdotes about your upbringing are limited to something that people can relate to and won't alienate you.
9. Watching the TMI - middle-upper class people are generally guarded about finances (like rate of pay) medical issues, personal problems (like divorce), kids who are embarrassing them, sexual or violent stories, and such. These things sometimes only happen on TV for them. They've never seen a real drive by or got kicked to the curb because mama didn't pay the rent. So you won't get to share really until you are deep in with someone and in a private conversation.
10. Watching my CPTSD - childhood PTSD is very real and effects us as adults. Situations with conflict are terrifying while people who were not abused may see a heated debate or constructive, but blunt criticism as good business and emotionally neutral. When it happens to me, I think people hate me, are rejecting me, and are going to get rid of me. It is a completely instinctual reaction and I have a real hard time connecting to the competitive, aggressive exchange of ideas and constructive aspects of these discussion.
11. You have to fear anyone who is different than you, but you are ""better"" than when you have a low-income background. You can be a genius, tremendously talented in your field, and even humble, but  if you shine too bright and  you don't fit in their cabals of social organizations, legacies, and cliques, you either have to try really hard to fit in or fear your professional and social future.  NOW there are places you can work, like many great non-profits or social justice organizations, but in the big business world you are constantly  having to pretend to be someone else and making a consistent effort to hide your past (unless you can somehow capitalize on it.) 

So the only resort is sticking with the people who know you and understand you, while advocating for them. If you don't, you are going to have to hide everything you are, or learn to completely capitalize and market that aspect of you as an amazing selling point. Otherwise they treat you like a trained monkey."

While high school clique and mean girls stuff seems to be high school, these ladies get it carried over into their sorority cabals, which carry over into the professional world. They take a TON of identity in that.  So for example, a woman who has being at the same university as her parent's legacy, attends there to her MA, then gets jobs working in the infrastructure, working with her sorority and fraternity brothers, and never actually going anywhere else and trying anything else meets someone who has travelled the world, knows many types of people, understand things she has no experience in, lacks those cabals of influence, and is actually a better, smarter person who out performs her at all sides, but is an OUTSIDER - she gets real pissy and gathers her little posse to destroy that threat.

Without parents who stand up for their kids they will get steamrolled by bully teachers on power trips. (This happens to poor familes a good deal as well.)

I mean in the great span of life what does it matter if you listened to a kid or mom and gave them help while making it a learning experience?

You don't loose any power. You are being a good teacher.

Buuuut no. Some teachers like to control, say no when it doesn't matter, and generally think they are smarter than parents.

Sometimes teachers are smarter, but they are graceful and kind,babe know how to treat people with respect when real life happens.

My only worry is this will escalate to retaliatory behavior so watch your kids grades and classroom experience carefully.  

You taught your kid a good lesson. They can fight the system when people do not follow rules, make then up, or use them when it is not applicable to the situation.

So EASY to get certified - but you'll need the started fingerprint live scan done that the state capitol and full background check.  You'll need to call them once a week to check on the progress of your doc.  People here can be very slow with paperwork. 

You'll also need at least one of your past employers to confirm you did indeed teach at some point or you just got your cert/license.  They will have to officially sign and send a doc to the Dept of Education. 

Pay Range: 65k to 45k to 42k (in order of urban to rural) for a first-year teacher. If you have proof you have been teaching longer you can transfer into a higher pay-grade-level.  Benefits are pretty good - end up with Blue Cross or Cigna usually - low cost for you, HIGH cost for family members.

As for shortages :

DO NOT WORK FOR AN ONLINE CHARTER SCHOOL or one of their sites - personal experience - just don't.  The two major companies - the main, multi-state corporation is under investigation by the OSBI and IRS and the other is being investigated for their questionable practices in HR. 

Regular Charter Schools, like John Rex, Positive Tomorrows, Dove Science, and Santa Fe - plus more are much nicer and definitely nonprofits. 

OKCPS is a tough place to work if you don't understand how to work with diverse, low-income students and families, plus combat the general low-self-esteem our teachers have.  Some of our teachers really go the extra mile here and they shine.  Others are emergency credentialed crazy people or fossils or seat warmers babysitting classes of kids.  If you can get a job in a new school (as in a new building) it is best and I can say they are working on being better and have hope. 

Moore schools (as you go south) are nicer and have more money.

Norman is smaller and very nice since there is lots of tax money floating around and many kids parents are in the education professions. 

If you do absolutely love working with inner-city, low-income kids - I say go for it.  I loved my students both high school and elementary age and they were fantastic once an adult showed them they could trust them, found their strengths, and helped them contextualize and face the trauma in the lives together.   

There is a decent amount of support for diversity, LGBTQIA people, multiple faiths, and differing types of families. 

Richer areas like Tulsa, Lawton, Edmond, El Reno, and so forth will have better pay and more quality staff - you will be working with middle-class kids mostly and subsequently deal with those obstacles as well. 

NOW

Rural schools - you'll find many conservative traditionalists who will expect you to hold to basic Christian ideals.  In most cases, it is not acceptable to be out and LGBTQIA (and sometimes not physically safe.)   You will be expected to model Christian morals and ethics, skirt issues like family planning and evolutionary science, and even be asked to do things like pray in class, attend prayer meetings or support prayer meetings, as well as participate in Christian holidays as part as school activities exclusively. So if that floats your boat - go for it.  Just don't encourage kids to come out and be gay till they are 18 and can leave town.  Horrible right?  Google ""gay man's house burned in Oklahoma - run out of town""  or ""kindergarten teacher run out of town Little Axe""

raisedbynarcissists,fe2lnpv,t3_ennm1r,1578840061.0,"Sadly highly intelligent people with narcissist and sociopathic behaviors are indeed clever, subtle, manipulative, and very good at always seeming like the good guy when they are questioned.

HOWEVER one thing stands - they are rarely self-aware of their behaviors as unique to themselves. They do not see the abuse is wrong as they are getting the feelings of control and self-esteem by having power over others.

So family is one locus of control. However you'll find out they seek that control in their outside relationships.

So if anyone ever challenges their power, they become evil or bad. Or criticizes them. Or suggests they calm down and their behaviors is extreme or unethical (or even illegal.)

So I learned I could tentatively manipulate my abuser by using positive messages, compliments, and suggestions whenever they were ranting about someone or something and plant seeds that directed them out of my life before I had to get a VPO.

So really the only way to defuse them is to make them feel even more good about themselves and encourage them they are not a victim but in control. The goal is to accept they will always think they are right, the smartest person there, and use that to move on from episodes.

My father had the same behaviors as a child and I felt so trapped for the duration of that relationship. Yet that experience reminded me I can deal with him now the same way when I find I must play the dutiful daughter at family events.

(Of course the worst thing you can do is to walk away and shut them out (aka stop listening and paying attention to their anger or abuse. Worse for them. So you can stop their drama by just not playing into their confrontation and dramas. This especially helpful if they are violent. We learn to see the signs of someone about to explode and can avoid them. And if course, take drastic action to not be around that person. If that means going to live with an aunt or grandma or taking you kids to a domestic violence safe are, just do it.)

I should've known because it did the same in college.  I remember a ton of BP moments in college, but my old friends will come back with stories I have NO MEMORY OF. 

So this year - I didn't get much done despite having lofty plans, racing thoughts, and attempts to launch.  I'm about to head off on a new journey and as soon as I can - finding a replacement for Lamictal, even though its been good for so many other bad things.

Because I KNOW so much - but I lose my glasses four times a day.  I forget I am driving sometimes and close my eyes.  I forget everyone's names.  I forget how much money I spent.

Most recently I had a hypomanic episode after my temp boss cut my hours 1/2 for going to a real job interview (for 40k a year vs 10$ per hour) so I reported them for stealing merchandise or destroying it due to carelessness.  It was all true.  I'd been through the database and checked inventory - large, expensive things were missing entirely.  I did it anonymously, but when I came in for my last week of work I got some cold-ass stares plus people were handling me with kid gloves.  The corporate trainer had told me to report stuff privately while the store was opening and getting established and I might get paid.  Plus, I'd been working my ass to go the extra mile, to promote the brand, and bringing in customers in droves while they fucked around piddling about too much cocoa in the cocoa (so it could be properly sampled) and helping ""too much"" by getting customers back stock or redressing the displays they threw shit on like an episode of Hoarders or having ten pallets of merch not stocked on Black Friday they never shelved and we ran out of it all. 

**I just COMPLETELY FORGOT I was so mad and angry at those bitches for treating me, a professional business person and manager like shit** because I was down on my luck and working holiday retail. Till I saw those faces and I was like SHIT - I know this was anonymous - but apparently, since the boss hired most of her friends from church to work their permanently they ""narrowed"" it down to me.  I didn't report that because I was done with them and the church friends were nice people - (just the other people I worked with were better, harder workers and really understood the products well.

bipolar,fe0qh1p,t3_encbw8,1578817445.0,"I'll put it up there with the current fad to have a disability for profit, sympathy, or to feel special. And there is always Munchausen (not by proxy) Syndrome

Like:

1. Being ""allergic"" to foods that don't immediately kill you or cause you to need an epi-pin.  Food intolerances or foods that just don't agree with you are fine - like lactose intolerance vs a milk allergy that makes your throat close up are just that.  Gluten-free is also a good example - people with Celiac will die - people who think Gluten isn't healthy for them won't die.
2. Eating disorder and body dysmorphia delusions; I find normal-sized people love identifying as fat and are really into fat acceptance and all the fat support groups - but after reading a few comments about how they can't lose weight (that stubborn five pounds keeping them out of size 0 and true happiness) suddenly people figure out this is a normal-sized person.  However, the mental health issue is not ""i'm fat"" it is ""I have body dysmorphia and I don't see myself as normal thus I am forcing limitations on myself for no reason."" 
3. And mental illness - my personal opinion if a real, live doctor of psychology diagnoses you with a mental health issue, go to a second one and review it.  I started out with ADHD and Depression which took another year to say ""maybe it is BP?""  IF you do not have a medical diagnosis you should not go around saying you are anything. Not as a joke or for sympathy or to excuse bad behavior.  It shouldn't hold you back from living or be an excuse to shirk responsibility.  I WANT to go to work and any day I have clinical depression is hellish because I know I belong at work and belong helping people, but the biochemical imbalance makes it like I am walking in concrete.  Just calling in and saying 'I can't work today, I'm depressed"" than popping back on Tuesday because you partied too hard on Sunday it cheapens the true desperation and terror we live in. 

So language needs to change like ""I feel anxious"" vs ""omg I have anxiety"" or ""I'm so bipolar' vs ""my feelings are mixed"" or ""my behavior is unpredictable and I don't know why!""  And most definitely - don't use self-diagnosis except to inform yourself you need to head a doctor and investigate."

2. Lay off the weed if it is keeping you from dealing with pressing, urgent situations you need to deal with.  It is also good to take a look into how it works with the Seroquel.  I'd also question ANY doc that would have you suddenly go cold turkey - so when you say ""wean"" I hope you mean slowly reducing your old meds over a span of three months not just cutting you off and giving you new stuff. 
3. There is nothing wrong with staying with your parents if it is a safe place.

All I have is my mind and mind has so many things in it, so much starvation from not having someone to talk to about all these ideas and theories, and I am just starved for the doing of good things for people.

You see I am always acting so I fit in or be acceptable to the environment I am in, but it is exhausting and it adds another level of pressure to the bipolar mood changes.  So when I am sad everyone hates me and/or are out to get me OR I do something to make that happen inexplicably.

tumblr,fdtatt6,t3_emt6cu,1578714171.0,"I can comment here on one ""girly"" thing that all male gamers probably do yet criticize non-violent or non-conflict oriented games as much as some pretend to revile female players and in some cases the addition of female characters.

Males that I have played with lived with, and gamed with will spend hours and hours dressing up their characters in fun costumes and customizing their avatars.

They will spend lots of real and pretend money to buy skins to dress up their avatars.

They play dress-up with little dolls for hours making their characters as pretty, cute, or cool looking as possible.  And take identity from that appearance no matter what gender or what species. 

They also will spend hours crafting items to decorate their player housing or making gifts for friends or even cooking for their guilds, raids, or teammates in-game.  

Some even make clothing and toys!

Or dress up their mounts with rainbow sparkles. 

And I think this is one of those meta-wonderful things where we see this under-narrative that the games give them access to that secret (and often shameful) place of doing girly things that aren't directly related to committing acts of violence in games.  It is therapeutic secretly to get to play with dolls and quite good for little boys in general as they grow.
