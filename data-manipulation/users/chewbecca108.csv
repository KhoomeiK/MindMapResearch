trees,fc69020,t1_fc68d4r,1577475041.0,But yes. This fucking second no I can't do anything at the moment. And joking about mental illness is pretty fucked up. You don't know the people I've lost and almost lost from depression? Go joke about other things people can't control. How about diabetics? How about the physically disabled? Do you joke about them too?
trees,fc68tuo,t1_fc68glf,1577474926.0,Omg apples 😂 that's so classic and I haven't tried it before.  This one was definitely thin glass. Something like that would be decent until the checks start to get back to normal. And invest in something probably unbreakable or harder to break
