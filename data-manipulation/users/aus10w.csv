first, i’m so sorry about these experiences. you’re not the asshole for wanting to protect yourself, and you’re not the asshole for putting yourself first in this scenario. i *completely* understand why you’re doing it, and i can’t say i’d do any different if i were you. what’s important to consider though is that this girl was essentially brainwashed. she was raised and indoctrinated into this extreme and dangerous conservatism of religion. and with little to no real world experience and real world issues to deal with, in that moment, it was the only right thing to her. college can change people, experiencing new ideas can change people. you don’t have to forgive her, i don’t think i ever could, but that person that you’re not forgiving may not exist anymore. i would ask that you give her a chance to understand. help her understand the pain that you and so many other homosexual children unfortunately go through because of radicalized religion. YOU deserve closure. and everyone deserves to be loved by a family member. if you decide to do this OP, don’t do it for her, but do it for yourself. it’s a risk, but it may be one of the best decisions you make in your life. good luck friend!"
