AskReddit,ffpkvn7,t1_ffpkc7c,1580097529.0,"I'm not sure how you're viewing the comments, but from my perspective (both RiF and mobile Chrome, and I'd suspect the same on the desktop and other places), your ages appear as ""1."". That's due to the way that Reddit comment markdown works - you start a line with a number followed by a period and it's automatically formatted and renumbered as an ordered list along with other neighboring lines that start the same way, starting at 1.

In other words, it looks like you've both claimed to be one-year-olds due to the way you've formatted your comments.

It's a lot less funny now."

If you're anything like me, I'd definitely recommend a Terminator. I bought mine from a dealer near Chicago with <20K miles for roughly $30K. You could probably haggle out a better deal, but I was happy with that given my experience and the car in question. I had the car shipped to me within a few days, and everything turned out really well, and now I've somehow got one of these legends in my garage.

Mine is very stock (aside from a catback), and I'm still in deliberation about exactly how much I want to change that, but it's a hell of a car. Much cooler than I am, that's for sure! I actually learned how to drive stick on it, and it's honestly just fun to drive around anywhere, at any speed. The thing just oozes baditude."
