I know it sounds a bit contradictory, but whoever it was that was driving essentially drove themselves into that tree through their lack of experience. Parking lots, gravel roads, and (ideally) tracks are where this skill is built and not side streets with trees and pedestrians.

Exercise,fdjh4xs,t1_fdjgtmh,1578470579.0,"That’s what I thought. I’m on my second one now that’s similar to that after wearing out padding on the first. Seriously, just take your time with it and focus on intentional and fluid movements. In my experience, most people feel awkward with those things initially and have a difficult time trusting them. You’ll feel it in time. Also, try to remember that your feet are right underneath you. You’re not far off of the ground whatsoever."
Exercise,fdjgb8i,t3_elogf0,1578469559.0,"I used a friction one for about two years and I was 210 at the time. It only came loose once and it wasn’t due to the doorframe caving under my weight. I pulled myself up very quickly and came to a very sudden stop at the top. Somehow, the way I did it pulled the whole thing loose and I fell. I did land on my feet though. You’ll hear some cracking from the wood compressing under what’s likely the crossbar on the side of the doorframe facing you for a while as you pull up. As long as indentations in the trim don’t bug you, everything will be fine. Also, keep in mind you’re not actually hanging from the trim. Given time, you won’t even think about it."

Regardless of what your answer is, you’re wrong in saying “can’t”. You can and it still causes the same reaction in them that it does in kittens, in that they relax. It’s just that, much like it’s been discovered that it does in kittens as well, it actually causes them to become more anxious. This is why I specifically say to do it quickly and only when getting a cat into a carrier that more or less refuses to go into one. I’ve also only done this when it’s been in a cat’s best interest and I always do whatever I can to calm them afterward. I’ve only done it twice with my cat that I’ve had for at least 6 years now. The first was when I picked him up feral from a shelter and only did so after he’d already torn up a volunteer’s side that tried to cram him into a carrier and the second was the first time he needed to go to the vet. These were the first and second times he was placed in a carrier by me. He goes in easily now. I’ve also assisted in relocating a significant number of feral cats. In which case, their being placed in a carrier was also in their best interest and was only done the one time."

aww,fcpe8pq,t3_eid8vx,1577860224.0,"I wouldn’t call it a “pro tip”, but I’ve adopted and had to relocate a few feral cats that were somewhat pleasant and pretty approachable but absolutely HATED cages. Set the cage up so that it’s firmly planted with the door open and the cage itself facing up, get the cat safely (for both the cat and you) by the scruff of the neck, lower it carefully into the cage being mindful of not catching the cat on the sides and thus relieving pressure on the neck created by the weight of the cat’s body, release the cat into the cage, and quickly close the door. If you’re dealing with a feral cat or one that hates cages then DO NOT have your hand in the cage when you release your grip. Drop them from the door. Unless it’s injured, the cat will be fine. Regardless, a cat can absolutely destroy your arm trying to get free from a cage and you can pick up sooo many infections from feral cats. Just drop it from the door and get the cage door shut quickly. 

It’s also important that you move quickly and very deliberately. Have the cage already set up and ready for the drop. Additionally, if you’re adopting or picking up a doped cat from a vet, put a towel in the cage. It’ll cushion their landing and give them something to hold onto during transport so that they’re not sliding around on the plastic and banging into the sides of the cage as you drive and carry them around."

AskReddit,fcdj56s,t3_egwzp7,1577610512.0,"Avoid meeting them or letting them see you for at least an hour after their coming inside. The person that is behind whatever they’re looking into is always someone they meet within 5 or 10 minutes of a case kicking off. The hour window is just to be safe. Also, don’t act creepy and DEFINITELY don’t dress up like any kind of ghost or monster in an attempt to scare them off. Daphne will smell that it’s you in a heartbeat. Either that or someone else will discover it’s you that did it by mistake."
