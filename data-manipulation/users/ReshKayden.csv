Games,fg1629o,t1_fg0usa0,1580421463.0,"It's actually a really good question that I had to think about pretty carefully before I answered.

I think in a nutshell, at risk of sounding too glib, it's that the kinds of games I could theoretically make with one guy and part of my free time are not the types of games I would want to play myself as a customer.

I think people seriously underestimate the amount of work it takes to make a successful ""indie"" game. Stardew took ConcernedApe 10 hours a day, 7 days, a week, for *4 straight years* to make. Same for Notch and Minecraft, or Toby Fox and Undertale.

These just aren't really things that can be done as part-time side gigs."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fg0k8rc,t1_ffzfufp,1580409482.0,"He's a shounen fighting anime main character. So the same way they all go.

He's likeable, plucky, determined, kind, good, and has really no major character flaws. Any weaknesses in his quirk are clearly temporary and he'll power through them eventually. (Whether it's his X% One For All limitation or his arms or what have you.)

He'll keep discovering ""new"" abilities in times of extreme duress in the nick of time and win every fight, with or without the help of others. If we're lucky, he might have some temporary losses just to keep things interesting, but he'll always succeed and will inevitably be the next All Might in the end.

But his core character and principles and motivations will never significantly change until he gets there. He'll never really challenge the reader's perceptions or go against the things that make him identifiable, aspirational, and likeable. He's already pretty much perfect, and it's just an inevitable matter of time until he's strong enough.

I don't dislike him. He's a *really great* version of the typical shounen protagonist. But there's also just not a lot of room to break from the formula when you're a main character in these kinds of anime. Secondary characters have a lot more freedom."
sandiego,fg0gdzo,t1_ffzkiqj,1580407246.0,"Yup. You can get an exception if you apply for an actual permit. The parks service and firefighters will also erect temporary firepits on some of the big beaches in designated areas sometimes for summer, so maybe that's what you saw. Keep in mind that Coronado is also its own city separate from San Diego and may have its own exceptions.

But you can't just light a fire anywhere on the beach you want. Huge no-no. Another thing people don't seem to realize is that you're not allowed to drink alcohol on any San Diego beaches either. So if you're *drinking* at a bonfire, like one guy in this thread admitted to, you're actually liable for a maximum fine of up to $2,000 per person and 6 months in jail."
Games,fg0g3a7,t1_fg06cqi,1580407072.0,"The ""toxic environment"" part of it has *definitely* changed. Crunch has always been a thing, depending on the company and project. People crunched even back in the 80s and 90s before companies got big and lots of money was involved. So it's a controversial and complex thing people have been arguing about for literally decades.

But what's really changed is the customer environment. There used to be a really fun, positive, responsive relationship between devs and players. As a dev you could always feel happy and proud that your crunch turned into something amazing that people enjoyed. Yeah, there was always people who didn't like what you did, like any kind of entertainment, but that act of *creating* a world that other people can experience and enjoy was super empowering.

These days that feeling is pretty much gone. The relationship between players and devs has become not just toxic, but outright dangerous. The sheer level of sneering, aggressive, nasty vitriol aimed at just about anyone who works in games by the very people who voluntarily play them as their main hobby is really shocking. It's why we devs are simply not *able* to talk directly to players anymore, except through designated community, PR, and production figureheads -- just for our own safety.

I've had players try to smash into our offices through the window with a cinder block, carrying long serrated knives and trying to ""kill as many greedy devs as I can."" One office still had dents on the stainless steel blast doors in the main lobby from where someone tried to ram their car in. One player tried to run me down in the parking lot of a conference. I had to keep my cats inside and install cameras all around the outside of my house when someone tracked me down on Google Earth and offered a bounty for anyone who would catch and torture them to death on live video. I've had to change banks at least four times because of attempted identity theft. And I'm not even a famous name that anyone would know.

If there's something that's going to eventually kick me out of gaming, it's not crunch or the relatively crappy pay, as awful and soul-crushing as that is over time. It's going to be our own customers."
Games,fg0fe02,t1_fg07w8z,1580406646.0,"Yup. That's pretty much exactly it.

As for the layoffs, people don't really understand how the business side of games work. How they're funded, what the dev cycles are, etc.

If you ask any artist, they'll tell you the trick to creative professions is volume. The vast majority of ideas you have for a final piece turn out to just not really come together or be that great in the end. For every hit song there's 30 that were scrapped on the way. Hits don't just spring whole-formed 1:1 with 100% reliability.

It's the same with games. Probably 80% of games never make it out the door. Customers never hear about them. You spend millions of dollars and a year of dev time to discover the concept just isn't resonating, or the engine can't do what you want, or the hardware isn't there yet, or you can't find the fun. ""Prototypes"" help but aren't sufficient.

Someone has to pay for all that. And banks, venture capital, standard investors, etc. won't pay for AAA games because it's too risky. You need to typically take publisher money, like a book or movie deal, which is essentially a high-interest loan in exchange for them taking a big chunk of your revenue when/if you succeed.

Customers just see ""$100M budget, 20 million copies sold at $50, that means $900M profit!"" but that is never, ever the case. The storefront (ex: Steam) takes $300M of that. You spent $150M on 7 other games that went nowhere before you got that hit. The publisher takes $500M for their cut. The engine company wants *at least* $50M (5%) for the license. Etc. And then you need to find at least $100M left over for your *next* game.

In the end, you're pretty much living ""paycheck to paycheck"" from hit to hit. There is no safety net. So there just isn't the kind of freedom to sit there two months before release and go ""eh, we're not gunna crunch this time."" Because if you don't, you're probably done as a company.

That's why companies can still fold and lay everyone off, or fire-sale themselves to their own publisher, even with a long track record of success and what looks like a recent mega-hit. You can easily be left with just not enough left over after everything is said and done to keep going."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ffzah9a,t3_ew0wn1,1580369604.0,"So far completely agreed on all points. The S3 fight between him and Deku was the high point for me. I have a lot of hope for the character progression from there and will be super disappointed if there isn’t any.

But that’s also why I like him. I have no clue where his character progression could go. It could be great. It could be awful. He could be a great hero, or a villain. He’s got so much going for him but is also so deeply flawed. So far every time I thought I knew, he’s surprised me. That makes it genuinely interesting.

So far Bakugo has easily the most fun and interesting quirk to watch as well. He can use it in so many ways to create such interesting and dynamic combat, whereas everyone else so far just seems like “the same one thing you did last time, just more/stronger.”

By comparison, I feel like I know exactly where Deku’s character development is going to go. It’s not that I dislike him, it’s just that he’s such a “safe,” relatable, shounen fighting anime main character to like."

The problem is when you get into that high of a number, it becomes difficult to prove conclusively because people forget or lie about how regularly they take it, or what their sexual behavior actually was, etc."
Games,ffz4z0t,t3_evnxno,1580364153.0,"I've worked in the industry for nearly (actually ""over"" now, christ I'm old) 20 years, from the lowest entry-level coder to CTO, and I can tell you we *still* argue about crunch among ourselves at every GDC and other get-together. It's a really complicated issue that nobody can agree on even at the same level or within the same company.

I can tell you one perspective though: the people suggesting ""if someone made me work 100 hour weeks I'd just quit"" really don't understand what propels a lot of us.

I didn't go to school to be a programmer. I went to school to make games. Coding just happened to be the one skill that I was good at that enabled that goal. But I didn't become a coder to write banking software, or a messaging app, or to make a lot of money. I did it because I loved games and this was the easiest way for me to contribute to that.

It's that way for nearly every other engineer, artist, designer, producer, etc. I've ever worked with. Going and working for any other industry, even though an equivalent job at another non-game company would (in my case) pay well over $250k/year more, feels like a ""failure."" It feels like admitting defeat and giving up on your whole purpose for work.

Worse, there just aren't very many game studios left, they are not always hiring through the full 2-3 year dev cycle, and it's very rare for a city to have more than one. Voluntarily leaving a project or a company therefore almost always means moving, not just to another state but sometimes to another country, if you want to stay in games.

Also, the industry is insanely inbred. Everyone has worked for everyone else at some point. If you leave a project mid-way through, or worse yet right towards the end, because you didn't want to crunch while everyone else did? People will be polite to your face, but you will never work in games again.

Is that ""passion"" that keeps us crunching? I mean, passion is what got us into this mess to begin with, sure. That's not ""wrong."" But what really keeps driving it is the brutal, hard, reality of how this place works and an overwhelming fear of what happens if you don't."
Games,ffz4avg,t3_evia7h,1580363499.0,"I don't think most gamers, as elated as they may be from the customer perspective, realize just how hard it is for studios to pull this off.

The Japanese voice acting vs. English voice acting industries work very, very differently in terms of licensing, royalties, legal country boundaries, agency share, credits, who owns the rights to approve re-releases where and when, etc.

Each tends to want contractual concessions from the studio that lock them into long-term limitations, and the ""customary"" expected concessions from NA v. JP voice actors and studios are often in mutual conflict with one another.

You need a lot of really strong clarity of purpose from the beginning to stick to your guns and push for a dual voice simultaneous release. It's becoming more common these days, but it's still really challenging from a legal and business perspective. So good for them!"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ffz2srw,t1_ffyeltv,1580362104.0,"People ""like"" characters for different reasons. Some only like characters they personally identify with or want to be more like. Some like characters purely for their visual design. Some like them because they're aspirational opposites of themselves: strong in ways they they feel weak or vice versa. Some just like them because they're narratively interesting.

For me, it's because Deku bores me. I feel like I already know exactly how his character arc is going to go. He's kind, and strong, and aspirational, and I'm utterly certain he'll succeed at anything he tries, usually by discovering some special talent during extreme crisis and power through whatever it is, because it's a shounen fighting anime and that's how they go. I don't *dislike* him, but he feels like a cliche that I can mostly overlook.

Bakugo, by comparison, is interesting. Yes, he's a jerk and I don't identify with that. But there are clearly some major complicated inferiority issues driving it. It's interesting and believable watching someone who's always been best at everything struggle to hold on to that. He has pleasantly surprised me on multiple occasions by doing the right thing when I was sure they were sending him down an ""easier"" cliched path.

We've seen him at both his most arrogant and also in tears, sometimes at the same time. While I can pretty much guess exactly how Deku's character arc and emotional development is going to go, I have *no idea* how Bakugo's story is going to go. Every time I thought I knew, I've been wrong, and that makes me like him.

His character design, costume, etc. is the most interesting to me. His quirk is the most fun to watch and allows for surprising, creatively dynamic fights that aren't just ""do that one thing but more."" Yeah, he's one of the stronger and ""cooler"" ones, but he's not always *the* strongest in every situation like an All Might (who also bores me), and despite his strength we've seen him in genuine trouble and needing help more times than any other character. I don't know how a fight with him is ever going to go, and that's fun and interesting."

AskHistorians,ffv6ill,t3_evcijw,1580256850.0,"Generally not. It's a cinematic effect to look cool. In both musket-loaded firearms, land and ship cannons, and later turrets on warships, there was benefit to firing in what's called a salvo, or every gun on the line firing simultaneously.

This had a few benefits:

It's really devastating to the oncoming troops to get hit all at once. It's much harder to figure out where the next shot is going to land and avoid it. Those old guns also just didn't aim very well, especially before the invention of rifling, so best to send one big blast.

In older firearms before smokeless powder, it gave time between shots for some of the smoke to clear so the next salvo could be aimed. You are at a disadvantage if your side is blinded by the smoke of individual guns still firing while the other side has a clear shot between salvos.

It took a long time to reload a musket or a cannon. By firing in a salvo, you can have two or more ""lines"" of fire and alternate between them, so one is firing while the other is reloading. Much easier to coordinate this back and forth between two salvos than 30 individual guns.

Hitting a moving target was especially hard. You needed to fire, see how you missed, then adjust. If firing consecutively, it would be difficult and ineffective for each gun to try this individually. Best fire in a salvo and have one officer watch and adjust everyone together.

That being said, the firing mechanisms on those old guns wasn't very precise either. Even if your firing officer told everyone to fire at the same time, it would probably take a few seconds for every gun to go off, just due to differences in how they were lit, primed, packed, etc.

There is also a legit speed of sound or signal delay on the order to fire down the line in a large formation. Some guns may only realize they should fire when they see the one next to them doing the same. So the result was probably often a semi-sloppy ""ripple"" of fire down the line anyway -- just not an intentionally planned and precise one like the movies."

explainlikeimfive,ffuomsi,t3_ev9sc0,1580246329.0,"The answer to this is more tricky and controversial than you might think.

Most of the answers in this thread are oversimplifications. The trouble with trying to correct it is that the ""chemical imbalance"" explanation, while still slightly incorrect, is a great deal *less* incorrect than the explanations that came before, such as depression being merely a lack of willpower or a failure to think positively. So it's a question of whether that explanation makes it ""good enough"" for you.

Here's the source of the confusion:

Your brain is just a meat computer. Every thought, emotion, memory, etc. you have is the product of brain cells talking to other brain cells. These cells talk to each other using certain chemicals like serotonin, dopamine, etc.

However, the cells do not have emotions of their own. This is where the pop science version gets it wrong. The chemicals do not ""cause"" certain emotions to happen. You can't simply pour dopamine on a bunch of brain cells and make them ""feel"" happy. Happiness is a complex state of trillions of brain cells talking to each other in a certain way that we don't really understand -- we just know that it uses these chemicals to communicate.

But here the explanation becomes circular: if something legitimately sad has happened to you, then your brain cells responsible for feeling happy are not going to be talking to each other, and therefore not going to be using as much of that chemical. In that instance, saying you're sad because of an imbalance -- a lack of dopamine or whatever -- is confusing the cause with the effect. Adding more of it to your system is not going to help if nothing wants to use it.

But on the other hand, there are a lot of disorders that can cause your brain to not produce enough of a certain chemical at all, regardless of what's going on in your external life. In that case, the cells responsible for happiness can't communicate to each other even if they want to, and you are simply incapable of feeling happy anymore. Now you're *correct* in saying it's the chemical imbalance that's the cause, rather than the effect, of your unhappiness.

Problem is, we have no direct way of knowing which of these is *causing* your depression in the lab. We can't directly measure brain chemistry or brain cell communication to actually give a diagnosis, even with modern technology. However we know that medication has an only 25-75% success rate on its own depending on the medication and the patient. So by implication, the second ""chemical imbalance"" explanation can't be the *only* cause for everyone.

That's why most treatment for clinical depression is to do both, to cover all possible bases: medication to alleviate any chemical imbalances that *might* be making it impossible to improve no matter what, and then cognitive behavior therapy or similar at the same time, to address any mental behavior that *may* be pushing your brain more towards a chemically imbalanced state to begin with."
explainlikeimfive,ffugdtg,t3_ev99yv,1580241394.0,"Keep in mind that Malcolm Gladwell is not considered a particularly reliable form of academic source. He is a pop culture psychologist with his own theories that are typically not rigorously tested, but sound good to a broad audience. For example, there is no academic source or experimental data behind his claim that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to be good at something.

But on an unrelated note (because shooting the messenger isn't a sufficient answer) there are different types of activities that require different types of practice. Fine motor skills, athletic ability, etc. all take rigorous practice to develop to elite levels because nobody has them from scratch.

However, plenty of people can grasp complex, rote intellectual skills such as how to solve a particular algebra problem after only seeing it a few times. They are doing little that helps them understand the problem more by subsequent practice. Rather, it's more that they're proving they understand it to the teachers' satisfaction in order to get a grade.

If someone is having trouble grasping the concept and regularly getting C's or worse on their homework, then practice and additional instruction can help them figure out what they're missing.

psychology,ffro6k1,t1_ffrliab,1580162126.0,"Abrupt changes are commonly reported when someone starts antidepressants, so it's definitely a thing. Relatedly, anti-anxiety meds tend to have the side effect of a regular libido, but being unable to climax. The meds do directly mess with the brain chemistry responsible for arousal and reward, so sexual side-effects are not just possible, but plausible.

I was more just saying that if you come off them 10 years later, and your libido still isn't back to where it was (this article was specifically referring to long-term or lingering effects on libido so I assumed that's what you meant) then also realize you could have completely recovered, it's just that 10 years later your ""normal"" is still noticeably below where it was.

Then again, Reddit isn't a great place to discuss anything about what's sexually ""normal"" either. The demographic is like 70% male and under 30 to begin with, and the social bias + upvote mechanic exaggerates the voice of the high-libido outliers on top of that."
AskReddit,ffrm5zd,t1_ffqxzka,1580160904.0,"Anime names are HUGE on word/kanji puns. Even if they *sound* like ""normal"" Japanese names to a non-native speaker, they're typically double meanings as in-jokes and so shouldn't be used out of context:

/u/HaungryHaungryFlippo used Hero Academia as an example, so continuing in that vein:

""Midoriya Izuku"" - the first kanji for ""green"" is a joke about his hair. The first kanji in ""Izuku"" uses a less-common reading and can be easily misread as ""deku,"" meaning inert or useless, as he initially has no superpower

""Bakugou Katsuki"" - the first kanji ""baku"" means explosion or detonation, the ""katsu"" is written with the kanji for winning or victory, which are obvious character design points

""Kirishima Eijirou"" - the last name is written with ""island/land"" and ""cut/slice,"" the first kanji in the last name is for ""bravery,"" which is an important character development point for him in later seasons

""Kaminari Denki"" - this is a *reverse* kanji pun. The last name is written with unrelated kanji but when put together sounds the same as the word for ""lightning."" Same with the first name and the word for ""electricity.""

It's pretty much the same all the way down the character list.

That kinda stuff is really common in all ""fantastical"" anime, especially aimed at the shounen/shoujo crowd. More adult ""slice of life"" anime like Makoto Shinkai's work tends to be more realistic and literal.

As a result, compared to the rest of the animal kingdom, childbirth is hugely painful and a relatively large number of natural births would end in death to the mother and/or child without medical intervention. It also means infant brains need to be smaller than needed for survival and so don’t come with useful pre-programmed stuff that other animals have built-in, like say... how to walk.

Our teeth are a mess. They rarely come in straight, few people have enough room for all of them, they are incapable of regenerating despite their only function being to grind down nasty stuff so we can survive, and so much can go wrong with even just that basic function that they had a tendency of outright killing us in fantastically painful ways until modern times.

Our appendix is a sack of literal poison that seems to serve no purpose other than to lurk quietly in your gut until it randomly bursts for no reason and murders you. Even newer theories that it plays a vague role in health of the microbiome don't justify the design.

There is no intelligent reason to have our primary reproductive pleasure centers share plumbing with our waste excretion system. Cross-contamination is a frequent problem even with modern day hygiene.

Our retina is backwards. The blood vessels that serve it are on *top* of the light sensors instead of behind. This means they have to come together and go through a hole in the retina to get out, leaving us with a permanent blind spot right in the middle of our vision. There does not seem to be any functional advantage to this.

The recurrent laryngeal nerve plays a critical role in letting us speak and swallow. But the way it's routed through the human body is hilariously bad. It gets caught on a lump of tissue during fetal development and pulled all the way down from our brains to loop around our heart, then back up to our throats, making it highly inefficient and vulnerable to injury and malfunction.

Our windpipe for breathing and esophagus for eating both open in the same place. There's no real reason it needs to be this way, and it means we can't swallow and breathe or talk at the same time, and we can easily choke on food and die. The half-assed solution of having our epiglottis serve as a flap to prevent this while we swallow doesn't always work very well and still kills thousands of us per year.

Testicles are stupid. They need to hang outside our bodies because whoever designed them to work at one temperature clearly never got the inter-office memo from the department that designed the rest of our body to operate at a different temperature. As a result, our most critical reproductive organs are extremely vulnerable to injury, and due to other stupid designs around how the nerves developed as they descended during fetal development, painful to the point of near full-body incapacitation when hit, which is exactly what you don’t want in a fight.

That's not the case in a lot of the animal kingdom. Most are only fertile for a tiny window of the year. And not just the females -- many male animals' whole reproductive systems completely shut down and regrow from scratch once a year in time with mating season.

During these times, animal porn would conceivably have no effect anyway. So as a random human bystander that doesn't work in that field, you're just not going to witness it by random observational chance.

But yes, many zoo breeding programs (pandas being the most famous) do use animal porn during mating season to help things along. Just realize even then, most animals' actual sexual intercourse is only seconds long at best, so for many there's just not much to even *show.*

(Edit: I completely forgot that I have a cousin who works in endangered animal husbandry for the zoo when I wrote this answer! I showed this to her and she agreed, but suggested I add that when most animals are in their narrow fertility window, the urge to have sex is so overpowering compared to ours that some will forget to eat, drink, or even seriously injure or kill themselves trying to tap that. So even if critter porn was “helping,” it would be awfully hard to tell.

It’s really only theoretically useful both during the fertility window, *and* if something else has gone wrong preventing them from wanting to on their own, as is usually the case with pandas in captivity.

I've stopped using Oura though, as I found Dreem is a better sleep tracker and my Apple Watch 5 is a better exercise tracker, leaving little middle ground on balance for the Oura to really excel, as impressive of a little device it actually is.

One small thing: you can actually delete those partial incomplete nights from your stats in Dreem. In Dreem, in the bottom left of each nightly card there's a little ""...""

Your point about ""wake time"" percentages is actually slightly inaccurate. Sleep scientists don't count the time it takes to fall asleep (sleep onset delay) in percentages.

Also unfortunately, while Oura has a pulse oximeter, which it uses to track pulse rate, the type they use is generally not  powerful enough to actually measure absolute oxygen content -- just detect a variation between heartbeats.

askscience,ffh2e4g,t1_ffgyfpf,1579921264.0,"Right now the CDC is saying that the proliferation rate is 1.4 - 2.5. Meaning every person who has it spreads it to about that many other people. For comparison, the common cold is about 3. So it's not that bad.

However the issue is that the CDC has no numbers of its own, as it doesn't have direct access to the data within the country. It's reporting numbers that have been given to it by Chinese authorities on behalf of Chinese doctors.

With the SARS epidemic, these numbers were wildly incorrect. So while it's unfair to say we definitely *know* they are incorrect, it's safer to say we just don't really know yet, until more disinterested third parties with better track records have a chance to weigh in."

economy,ffgit7u,t1_ffdx46u,1579907212.0,"Yeah, the history of it's actually pretty interesting. It arguably started with an article by Milton Friedman in the NYT written in Sep 1970 which stated ""the (only) social responsibility of business is to increase its profits."" Note that this was provocative at the time particularly *because* it was not a universal accepted truth.

He arguably had the right diagnosis. We were in a period of stagflation and low growth and it turned out that a ruthless pivot towards shareholder value and away from bloated over-management maybe *was* the tough love kick in the ass the economy needed at that particular moment.

The trouble is that a handful of Friedman's favorite professors ended up running HBS, and they started teaching this as a religion. A core economic truth, now and forever and ever, amen. And HBS' curriculum trickles down to business grad schools everywhere and then down to undergrad.

But the tradeoff to that philosophy is that it causes staggering inequality rent-seeking, financial bubbles, etc. over time. Sure it works, but not 100% of the time forever. Teaching it as a religion, instead of just one potential strategic tool to counter certain problems, is super dangerous.

It's like... you know what's a great, nearly free tool for boosting productivity, creativity, growth, etc? *Cocaine.*

It definitely works. 100% of the time! Pretty much guaranteed! But eventually cocaine stops working, and now you have a whole host of new problems from all the coke you just took. And your response to those new problems can't forever just be *""...more cocaine!""*

To me the bigger worry is that we now have two entire generations that believe the religion that Friedman's version of shareholder capitalism is *the only* form of capitalism. And now that it's not working out for them, they quite naturally have concluded that socialism is the only other option."
AskReddit,ffgh2xy,t1_fffnruf,1579906079.0,"We had extensive training at the executive management level recently about some of the barriers facing women in technology, and how as leaders we can make our team cultures a more receptive place to them.

One of the observations is that male-centric teams push a culture of stoicism, and that women don't feel they can show emotion. That if they cry when things are legitimately tough, they'll be stigmatized and passed up for promotion. So as leaders, we need to give women the safe space to be emotional when appropriate.

I completely agreed with this! Good observation, and yes we do!

...until I asked about whether it was okay for men to show emotion and cry at work when needed too. At which point everyone, including the HR reps, the trainer, the more senior execs, both genders, all awkwardly clammed up and said that was different.

That. Right there. There's the problem."

todayilearned,ffdnlax,t1_ffd5utd,1579824696.0,"Sure, and you're right. But VirtualRay was saying it made him sound gay, which I was correcting. The language *does* strongly code gender into the grammar. But gay v. straight doesn't follow that.

My point was that a gay guy dressed in drag and a straight guy dressed in drag are both going to sound *equally* grammatically female. So calling it out as a **gay** subculture thing has no real bearing."
todayilearned,ffdmu4i,t1_ffdkajp,1579824239.0,"It's a good question but... slightly the wrong one.

Japan is a very group-oriented society. Other people's opinions are generally more important than you. So what's defined as ""bad"" is if you sound significantly different from how someone else *expects* you to. That's the determining factor. It's an added dimension of what's appropriate, *in addition to* the usual way we talk about homophobia or sexism in the West.

Gay guys don't tend to use obviously different speech than straight guys. So you're not going to be that far off from what a listener is expecting. Therefore, not that bad, if there's no other obvious visual or behavioral cues that you're gay.

""Feminine"" speech is interesting because really all that means is slightly softer, less aggressive and assertive, and about half a step higher up the ""politeness"" grammar scale speech. So while it might be a little different from what the listener is expecting, it's hard to gauge the speaker's intent. Are they feminine? (Super bad, gender roles are still really harsh there.) Or just a little softer, more polite, and boyish? (Odd and idiosyncratic, but probably okay?)

But then there's a few overtly feminine terms (ex: atashi, kashira, certain ""ne"" inflections without the leading ""da,"" etc.) that *will* be extremely jarring coming from a guy and can *only* read as intentionally female. And those are therefore probably the ""worst."" Bad enough that as a foreigner, people will assume you simply made an actual grammar mistake and helpfully ""correct"" you."
todayilearned,ffdky8g,t1_ffdinpe,1579823076.0,"Waaaaay too big of a question to answer this far down someone else’s thread, I’m afraid.

Trying to summarize though, I’d say the biggest thing is that being gay in the US is all about *your* orientation, being true to yourself, coming “out” as gay, and how your individuality fits into society vs. religious ethical prohibitions of “sin” and all that.

Japan has a different perspective. It’s not an individualistic culture for anything, including orientation. Nobody cares who you sleep with or what you do in private. It’s not a “sin.” But everyone is still expected to “toe the line” in public.

The problem comes from when you want to be gay in public and want society to change to accept it as normal. Japan just doesn’t do that. As a functional mature stable adult you are expected to conform in public to not rock the institutional boat on anything.

So... be gay all you want in private. Just don’t act, talk, dress, or anything like it in public. And if you could also marry a woman and have children somehow so nobody has to know or deal with your whole... y’know... “thing,” even if you’re personally miserable, then that’s still preferable.

This is of course slowly changing, but painfully slowly. And this public v. private thing applies to the laws too. A solid majority of Japanese think gays should be able to marry, in the abstract. Even a higher percentage than the US! But when it comes to publicly voting to officially change the law? They keep voting it down by pretty decent margins."
todayilearned,ffd3sl5,t1_ffd3bb4,1579812866.0,"Sure, but drag is an act. It's performance art. You are specifically, for that moment, dressed up and speaking intentionally like a woman. Just like a straight guy would if playing a woman on stage. It doesn't have anything to do with orientation at that point. Drag queens don't actually *live* as their female drag characters 24/7, you realize."
