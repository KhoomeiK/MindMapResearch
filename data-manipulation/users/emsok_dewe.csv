KidsAreFuckingStupid,ff3o0gn,t1_ff3lgqt,1579545146.0,"I suppose that by vilifying the office you're also vilifying the officer. They're one in the same; there would be no officer without the office. Being an officer, by definition, means you represent the office. Bad officers also represent the office. I think that based on this it's the safe bet to assume all officers are bad until proven otherwise. That's basic self preservation. Like I said, that's how they view their interactions with the public. Why should the public view their interactions with the police any differently?

Of course they shouldn't have to die because someone is attacking them. They should be able to defend themselves. The public shouldn't have to die because the police are on edge either. They also should be able to defend themselves. I don't claim to have an answer or solution to this, theres completely valid arguments on both sides. This will probably never be fairly settled."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,ff3k0pj,t1_ff3huvd,1579542689.0,"I think my response to u/vildabeck covers this. Your last paragraph speaks to what I'm saying: how are we as the public supposed to tell the difference between those officers? Is the public's ignorance of police procedures the responsibility of the public? I would say it's not.

How can I tell if a cop is racist or not? Why is it my responsibility to know police procedures? Aren't they here to serve and protect *us*?"
KidsAreFuckingStupid,ff3j5ur,t1_ff3cjf7,1579542166.0,"My main point is also that not all cops are bad. I know that sounds ridiculous. We definitely agree on that. I'd even say the vast majority of police officers are not bad. The officers I known personally are great people. I don't know them professionally. The problem is that we really have no way to tell until after the fact, and police have a very strong impact on our lives. A very immediate impact. That should come with a certain amount of responsibility and respect to the people they are serving to protect. I personally, and many others, feel that that respect or acknowledgment of responsibility is no longer as important as it used to be. The bastard part of 'acab' stems from the good officers not speaking out against the bad ones. 

Have you ever seen abuse of force? Or abuse of power as an officer? Have you seen officers do something that morally offends you and have you spoken out against it? I guess for me that's where the 'bastard' line is drawn. I'm very far removed from that situation and from your line of work. I am fortunate in that regard. I suppose it's not fair for me to judge ""your"" actions (the actions of police as a whole) from a retrospective viewpoint. However, as a citizen that entrusts you and your brotherhood with my safety, would you put yourself on the line for the betterment of the public or for your fellow officers? (If you weren't retired)

I understand this whole conversation is very emotional for both sides and, honestly, thank you for giving me an honest response. Please don't apologize for your views, you've said nothing offensive to me. Again, in this interaction you are a person, not a uniformed police officer. I don't think you're a bastard as a person. As far as I'm concerned based on our interaction here you're a reasonable person. However, when you put on the uniform, the uniform now represents you, and for a lot of people that is a negative representation. Most of those people are criminals. Unfortunately, some aren't. 

I hope you can understand what I'm trying to say."

You are a cop. If I were to see you in uniform I'd assume you are also a bastard until we interact and you prove otherwise. That's not to say I'd be confrontational towards you, quite the opposite. I'd go out of my way to avoid you in the first place. No, I don't have anything to hide. I just don't trust police to use their power responsibly. Most do. However, I have no way to know ahead of time that a particular officer will. Therefore my default is to avoid and assume the worst.

If you get to approach every traffic stop and interaction as a chance you may be killed or injured, I think it's only fair to approach every interaction I have with the police in the same way. Again, the responsibility should not be on the public to prove we are good, you should go in assuming that. If you say ""well if we assume that about everyone and then we encounter a bad person we may get hurt"", then I'd say to you that also applies in the inverse, does it not? Until the police once again prove to the public they are a force for the good of the public then I think it's only safe for the public to assume that any interaction with a police officer is a potentially dangerous situation. You are taking this on a personal level, it's not. Acab points towards a systemic problem, which you may or may not be working to correct."

There are cops that are good people, yes, but that's not the point. The point of acab is to draw attention to the fact that the entire system is corrupt and needs reform. People that say acab aren't pro criminal or anti law. I, or at least myself and others I know aren't."
