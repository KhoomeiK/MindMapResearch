He may not listen straight away but there will come a day where your words make a difference or he realises he should have listened to you. 

Theres an amazing ted talk about what women believe about their right to pleasure which I found seriously enlightening, even as a woman!

Always listen to your partner/girlfriend, not only their words but their body language, and always always communicate. If you dont know the answer to something always ask. And work out a way to educate your brother on this too."
