wholesomememes,ffi56gc,t1_ffi3b9g,1579965376.0,That’s fucking bullshit. It doesn’t matter whether you’re directly watching along or not. It’s another factor that’s keeping you from being able to fully follow the lecture. It’s noise (no audible noise in this case) that makes it harder to receive the message of the lecturer. Another person watching a movie in your field of view does affect your ability to concentrate.
scriptedasiangifs,ffhzwmc,t1_ffhuvbs,1579960746.0,"*That* makes no sense at all in the context. Why would she even think the person she looked at and tapped was a woman? It’s not like the dude she tapped resembles a woman in any way. I know these gifs never make sense, but that’s just next level. There’s no way she thought he was a woman. Tapping him would either be to get his attention directed towards herself or towards the other guy. It’s just that they acted fucking weird and over the top. Honestly, I’m legit very interested to know where you get the idea from that she thought he was a girl because that just sounds like you’re making things up to have a reason to hate.

So let’s get this straight, I think her goal was to get the guy’s attent directed towards the other guy to shorten the line. While trying to get the guys to be interested in her is definitely possible, the other is more plausible. 

>we can rule out that its not about her luck with guys because she was not upset with the first couple.

That is just not true at all. She didn’t even want the first guy so why would she care about that? It looked like she thought he was a  dick so why would that upset her? However, the first couple did show her that it’s possible so she could want to try her luck out only to find out that in contrast to the first girl, it didn’t work out for her."
scriptedasiangifs,ffhnmc6,t1_ffhknsp,1579944085.0,"The entire premise of these gifs is literally that it ends with an over the top reaction. 99% of the time, the entire reason to laugh is that it's over the top and around that they add a joke to make it work and not be the same as other gifs.

These gifs start of normal to make you smile and end with an exaggeration to make you burst into laughter (or at least they try). Same here: the first two walk away together and the second couple doesn't just have a twist, there's also the exaggeration to make you laugh. 

Honestly, I only see people *wanting* to get mad here. If the second couple were a guy and a girl, it would end the exact same way, but it wouldn't be as funny without the twist. The twist they added now was the joke they build around the exaggeration to make it all work. Without **a** twist, there wouldn't be a story."
