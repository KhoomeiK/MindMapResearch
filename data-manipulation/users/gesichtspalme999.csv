pcmasterrace,ffcwaai,t3_esqgxt,1579808597.0,Tbh I'm still fine with a 1050ti. I upgrade like once every 4-5 years or so. There's no need to get the latest if you can still run all games just fine.
biathlon,ffc8u2j,t1_ffc8bf4,1579794177.0,Hey thanks for your words. It's good to feel that I'm not alone for what it's worth.
pcmasterrace,ffc8epp,t1_ffc831v,1579793902.0,"Yeah that's what I thought. Even if you somehow manage to delete the directory, it should just install itself back right into place."
pcmasterrace,ffc82if,t3_esp25g,1579793684.0,"Correct me if I'm retarded, but is it not pretty much impossible to delete vital system files without booting into a different OS from like a flashdrive? ""delete system32"" is just a meme by now, right?"
biathlon,ffc6kmq,t1_ffc6cct,1579792716.0,"Yeah the pain doesn't go away when you lose a loved one. People tell you that it will numb down but it doesn't and you just have to live with it. It's hard.

Edit: The worst part for me is that we had a very close emotional connection and there are times when I just casually think ""Man I have to tell him about (thing that happened)"" and then realize that he's not there anymore. It's like a hard kick into your guts every single time."
biathlon,ffc5y6r,t1_ffc5gtz,1579792300.0,That must be the most heartbreaking success if it's true. I lost my dad a good year ago and I'm still struggling.
biathlon,ffc5jv0,t1_ffc5ghn,1579792032.0,worst bot reply ever..
biathlon,ffc5292,t1_ffc4xvq,1579791705.0,Is it actually confirmed? German TV said that he had an accident and that one of the guides was dead but no one knows about their father yet.
biathlon,ffc4qbl,t1_ffc1kad,1579791481.0,They both made mistakes that cost them a few seconds after the shootings. It's kinda fun to watch.
biathlon,ffc4285,t3_essrfg,1579791022.0,I really don't get why the German team as a whole has been shooting so bad for at least 3 years now. We lose everything on the shooting stand every single time.
softwaregore,ff0kil6,t3_er19ku,1579469737.0,You could probably turn that into a mad dubstep track with some editing

Skijumping,fesodgm,t3_eqgkun,1579367390.0,Holy shit Kubacki is in the season of his life. Aced it.
idlechampions,fee9ge5,t1_fee7xvt,1579029146.0,Just updated and tried it with one small contract and it seems to be fine. Thanks a lot
idlechampions,fee6dbz,t1_fee671b,1579027330.0,"I noticed that, too. Clicking distractions while you're walling is pretty much useless right now."

Also.. I've read that there was a bug with bounty contracts getting used up in incorrect amounts. Has that been looked at? I'm kinda worried to use them right now."
facepalm,feb1r66,t3_eo8kxi,1578954611.0,I'll just leave this here: [L.A. BEAST Eats 36 Raw Eggs With The Shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJDHHELBAm4)
worldnews,fe95udb,t1_fe8mm6u,1578934581.0,I think the important message here is that plastic trash that entered the ocean 50+ years ago is still intact and floating around. It might be a wake up call for people who haven't cared about the problem so far.
facepalm,fe94f8z,t1_fe8cgjy,1578934140.0,"I didn't imply it was his picture, but it must have found it's way on the internet somehow.. Pictures don't just randomly appear out of nowhere."

facepalm,fe2blrb,t1_fdwpo4t,1578836585.0,"""Pizzagate"" was an alt-right smear campaign against Hillary Clinton claiming that she was part of a child sex ring operating from a pizza restaurant. Iirc someone actually believed it so much that he showed up there with a firearm demanding for the children to be released."
germany,fdnwxuz,t1_fdntdhp,1578594521.0,"""People don't like getting killed but I don't want them to not like getting killed in my country. God forbid that"" Yeah.."
germany,fdno3ej,t1_fdnmt0o,1578589767.0,I ate the reality propaganda mate. You should try some. It tastes great.
germany,fdnmcgv,t1_fdnkkpw,1578588792.0,I just think that people shouldn't be attacked just because someone else decided that they belong to a group that should be hated. We should be beyond that at this point.
germany,fdnlvyb,t1_fdnlfrx,1578588523.0,I'm 36 and I know that feeling. Just know that you're not alone out there mate.

germany,fdniyun,t1_fdnh47x,1578586794.0,So you basically ate the whole far right propaganda pie and see efforts to combat it as censorship and totalitarianism. Makes sense.
pcmasterrace,fdnfzhg,t3_em1fq6,1578584996.0,"Hah that actually happened to me back when I was still playing Quake 2. Someone even emailed me about it with ""evidence"" that I was hacking and came over to me on the next big lanparty to check my PC for aimbots. Like he literally watched if I was playing on Gamespy and spectated me to record evidence. Good times :3"
germany,fdnf5p7,t1_fdnescu,1578584491.0,Yeah I guess we can just agree that it's the wrong thing to do.
germany,fdne4a2,t1_fdndr4l,1578583855.0,I acknowledge that some people have opinions that certain groups of other people should be hated on just because they have a different religion. The problem for me is that this even exists.
