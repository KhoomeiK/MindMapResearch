AskReddit,ff6p7mj,t3_ery2k3,1579631996.0,"We lived in a neighborhood where all the backyards connected, and nobody had fences so it was just one big mowed field. Right in the middle was a telephone pole with about five really tall pine trees in a circle.  It was extra cool in there, out of the sun. The needles made a soft carpet inside and we would hang out there, climbing the phone pole.  One year a kid dragged his sister's play house out there for us to chill in. It never left. When I was in college they took out all the trees and removed the bottom ten feet of rungs on the pole but I think the play house is still silently moldering where we left it over 20 years ago."

They work well enough but one is very limited in mobility (my feet were burned too) and the thumb-analogue is dexterous but very weak. The tendon connection isn't great."
