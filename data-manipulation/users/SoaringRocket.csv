You're making ridiculousness a specialty now. She was a minor part in a TV show—it would be a very poor one if they let everyone have lots of time to speak. But then she had a newspaper article. Not exactly someone without a voice.

I never said there was. I am asking for evidence and process. You are asking for ""natural conclusions"". Who's being silly here? Note again you don't address my point. And this was the most important: so clearly you have nothing further to say there.

You refuse to address the point I've made several times to you. It's the person making the accusation, not the person making the defence, who must show the evidence. Shame you are too obtuse to agree.

Not it's not. She basically said in the Guardian she'd made her point.

Anyway, it's pointless to discuss this because we are trying to infer what she may or may not have said.

>Even just based on what we know, it is reasonable to infer that racism was involved. In fact, it is a natural conclusion to draw. 

Here you make a very bad, but important, mistake. We can't have a system where serious charges like racism are adjudicated on the basis of ""natural conclusions"". This is where you and your ilk are so misguided. This logic allows a free pass for supposedly oppressed groups to make accusations whenever convenient. It's an appalling and unsustainable way to do things. I feel this is at the core of your misunderstanding. You don't understand how crucial it is to have proper evidence and process.

>by your standards, it would be perfectly okay when anyone expressed a reason for her treatment other than racism for some to interrupt them and go a spiel talking over them saying ""No, it was racism, It was racism, It was racism""

This is just silly. I said (several times I believe) claims without evidence could be rejected without evidence. Claims with evidence require evidence to rebut.

>It's a show for serious political debate. It's not acceptable just to shout people down, you don't agree with.

It's a show for serious political debate amongst the panelists. For good or ill, the audience rarely get a full hearing. But I don't really care about that, and we can't change how the show works. The important questions are more what is racist and how it is acceptable to adjucate upon charges of racism.

>We've been through this already. Simply repeating it over and over again because you didn't like my reply is getting us nowhere and accusing me of ignoring your points is rich.

Patently false. It's impossible to rebut an accusation with evidence when it is made without evidence.

>She was... alluding to the fact we shouldn't shy away from calling this racist because so socially unacceptable to use the word the current political climate.

She never made any such point. And it's not at all socially unacceptable to use the word: in fact it's quite mainstream.

Wrong again. She did more than make the accusation. She brought his race into it and made assumptions about his background and experience.

She didn't have an opportunity, that's true, but I don't think that's super interesting here. We heard what she said and can form our own views on that.

Well you are right that the Guardian article is preaching to the choir so we shouldn't expect a full explanation there.

>It's a case free for people you agree with and silence anyone you disagree with.

This is not at all true. Let's just discuss what occurred when deciding if something is racist rather than bring the skin colour of the people making the accusations or defences into things. That's all I ask.

I explained to you at length the difficulties with your Scottish/English analogy and  sought to show why her ""white privilege"" barb was unhelpful. But you've chosen to overlook all of that.

>She did give evidence for what she said, i.e. the poor treatment of Meghan by the press.

That's not what evidence looks like. That is just re-stating the premise. But anyway, it wasn't a great forum for her to lay out a well-argued case anyhow, so I don't think there's any way we could have expected that. But that wasn't really what we were discussing: we were discussing whether or not her ""white privilege"" approach was acceptable or constructive.

>The comparison between the way Meghan was treated and the way Kate was treated has been discussed by at length and part of the public discourse.

Discussed, sure. But no consensus has been reached. Many would say Meghan was treated wonderfully in the beginning, and whatever happened afterwards was as a result of the way she behaved.

Her accusation was nothing more than ""it's racism"" and his reply was nothing more than ""no"". There's nothing remarkable or unreasonable about anything in the exchange at that point.

>You haven't made any counter-argument to my analogy showing that pointing out that someone doesn't have relevant experience isn't racist.

I agree with you that it isn't racist to make that observation. My comments on your analogy were explaining why her ""white privilege"" comments are so unproductive and are racist.

>Instead you've made a number derogatory assertions about black people. You are the one deflecting.

If you want to insist on your racism accusations you should explain what you think is derogatory. Even better would be to tell me why my comments were wrong. But you don't seem very interested in either of those approaches.

samharris,ffam1j8,t1_ff9rrpu,1579739112.0,"First, he didn't shout down her view.

There are several problems with your analogy.

The biggest modification needed is to add that Scottish people are ultra-sensitive about any assumption of them as a group, and if an English person does so they're likely to lose their livelihood or even be prosecuted. Hence why English people are sensitive about such assumptions in reverse.

Also the Scottish person isn't talking about life in Scotland, they're talking about the way a subset of the English have treated them. So they're making an accusation at English people and simultaneously arguing it's impossible for the accused to mount a defence. That's contrary to any good justice system.

And the Scottish person isn't interested in explaining life in Scotland or why the English have treated them badly, just saying no-one else understands it. So the English person doesn't even comprehend the accusation itself.

Yes... it's just like being a court of law with no explanation of the charge, with no ability to respond to the charge, and if you levy any charges of your own you are immediately found guilty."

Quote from her Wikipedia page:

_Ted Cantle, the author of a government report on community cohesion, said Hussain had done ""more for British-Muslim relations than 10 years of government policy""._"

Sorry Randall—the sun isn't a pot of gold."

As for the power, Nietzsche seems to give much inspiration to the individual to make the best of themselves. But I suspect the key to saving the planet is through co-operation. I'm not sure where to go for inspiration on that."

Stoicism,feugbyi,t1_fetfs64,1579386264.0,I think the quote is incomplete in a sense though and does need a bit of further explanation. It's not Stoic to never seek the reasons for things. That is a path to ignorance and despair.

Why shouldn't I complain about the cucumber: because it doesn't do any good. Maybe I should try and figure out how to get a better cucumber next time if that's worthwhile: otherwise chuck it away and move on."

I guess the onus is on us all to step up to the plate on that. There's plenty of things that come up in the podcast that I'd like to discuss, but don't get around to posting about. Probably because I'm listening to the podcast on the move and forget when I get back to a computer... but that can change."

You can see this mathematically by changing a note by the perfect fifth ratio until you get back to a multiple of two—ie back to the octave. In other words, (3/2)^12 ~ 2^7."

- media companies require closed-source encryption (DRM) to combat piracy
- web standards accommodated this to eliminate browser plugins
- it's virtually impossible to implement a DRM solution independently as (i) it's loads of work and (ii) would need to be blessed and also used by the media companies, who would be unlikely to agree as they want access to the code to be limited

Stephen Hawking would have fought if sufficiently provoked and if he could do anything sufficiently effective. For example he could still drive his chair into things, or use other people as proxies. Everyone has potential means to fight.

JP isn't saying when it is wise to physically fight. The weaker man, even if wronged, would often be foolish to fight the stronger until he has properly prepared.
