Because I'm pretty sure they pray to God, and they believe Jesus is God and that whoever believes in Him has eternal life. I don't really see anything in the denomination that implies they're a false Christianity. Also, isn't Catholicism more works-based than Orthodox?"

I'm trying to have a nice, civil discussion. I'm not swearing or making assumptions about you. I'm asking you to stop being rude and telling others that their beliefs are wrong. You, in turn, start calling me names and swearing at me, not caring about the people on this subreddit that might find that offensive. I don't see how I'm doing that, as you're calling me a hypocrite. But feel free to tell me how. 3) I don't want to make assumptions about what you believe, but from the way you talk I don't think you really have a place on a Christian subreddit. You're also violating the rules on this subreddit, so we'll see what the moderators have to say. 4) I don't really know what on earth snake oil is, but it seems like you completely ignored my statement that I think medical help is completely justifiable for this person. Actually, it seems you ignored all of my statements. I hope you learn to be more mature in talking to others. Have a good day, and God bless."

And again, if you don’t think praying for this person will do anything, you’re welcome to leave.

If you’re going to be rude and disrespectful then you can stop talking."

2. The Bible has very little detail because it’s not made up. For example: you would think God Himself ascending into Heaven would be a pretty detailed part of the story. But that’s not the case. The Bible simply just says “A cloud opened up and he ascended into Heaven”. How could this be possible; there’s no detail! Because the people writing it weren’t writing a fiction novel. They just wanted to get their point across. They were just telling us what happened. Point is: if you read the Bible and realize how weird the story is, you’ll see why no one in their right mind would make up a story like this. Also, about the apostles “exaggerating” His miracles: I don’t see how you can exaggerate how someone turned water into wine, or walked on water, or raised someone from the dead. Those sort of things can’t really be explained by some sort of scientific explanation, that’s why they’re, well, miracles. Also, there were people so astonished by what He did that they thought His powers must have come from the enemy or some sort of dark force. (But of course, Christians don’t believe this because it’s also clear in the Bible that He lived a sinless life and also died for us rose again and went to Heaven.) People were always asking Him to heal them and fix all their problems (and some of course did treat Him like a magician and asked Him to do some miracles just to see them), but He only performed miracles for those that stuck with Him and had trust and faith in Him. He helped those that KEPT following Him and never turned back.
3. It’s the best proof because it’s literally people who witnessed God Himself. “No one did fearing disapproval”. Um, I don’t think people have ever had any problem telling Christians that they’re “wrong”. Of course, Jesus Himself was hated (for speaking the truth). Can you maybe show me some evidence that these are just biased documents they made up and no one bothered to check them? Not entirely sure where you go that from lmao.
4. So in other words, we still don’t know where consciousness came from. Ok. Consciousness is not a physical thing, it’s why we won’t ever make a robot that will become self aware or anything. It’s just not possible for dust to become consciousness, no matter how much time you put on top of it. It’s unscientific.
5. “Free will created God”. Well, it was our free will that separated us from Him in the first place. Our free will is what gives us the capacity to disobey Him. It’s why you don’t believe in God. Christianity asks a lot of us. It asks us to do things we’re not exactly comfortable with and you wouldn’t exactly do if you were just living by our nature and our natural instincts. No one really wants to stop doing the sinful things they’re doing, like lusting after people, watching porn, getting angry, stuff like that. Our belief is that we do those things because we are separated from a higher, perfect being, and no matter how hard it’s going to be, we have to try and stop our sinful behaviors. Christianity isn’t always fun and easy, and at least for me, that’s proof that it didn’t come from humans.
6. I guess I didn’t really elaborate on what I meant by “ego”, sorry about that. What I mean by ego is that we naturally think there couldn’t possibly be something higher than ourselves. The difference between atheists and Christians is that one gives into that and one fights against it. I think people today need to have the mindset people had in the Middle Ages, where they would look around them and think “surely something higher than myself created this.” Instead of looking around at what we have done and the discoveries we have made and thinking “all this science must mean a God doesn’t exist”, I think it makes more sense to say “surely the fact that all of this makes sense means that all of this was created by a higher being.”
7. I of course think if you incorporate any religion other than Christianity into your life, you’re not going to get great results. If you try to incorporate Christianity into your life, you won’t exactly be fulfilled unless you make it the center of your life. I’ve been a Christian my whole life, but I haven’t really noticed any major fulfillment or happiness until recently, when I started actually praying, reading scripture, doing research, talking about Christianity with my atheist friends, and attending Church weekly. And something weird happens when you do that. When you make God the focus of your life. Its all you can think about and all you want to talk about. You won’t have a desire to consume secular things. You’ll notice a lot of the sins, the chains that were holding you back, being broken (not all of them of course, we’re not perfect). Christianity doesn’t really have an effect on your life unless you go all in. 
Also I’d just like to say thank you for being respectful in this debate, it’s nice to see an atheist that doesn’t just say “religious people are stupid” for a change, lol. Have a good day and God bless."

Christianity,ffh64yk,t1_ffh0wic,1579924173.0,"That's a good question, thanks for asking. I'll admit that I haven't done much research on other religions, but I can tell you that Christianity is different. It's the only religion in which we are already saved, where we acknowledge that we aren't and never will be perfect. Also, speaking as someone who was unfortunately involved in a lot of psychic and spirituality stuff, that kind of thing (talking to ancestors, spirits, guides, trying to somehow become psychic and stuff like that) is enjoyable, but not fulfilling. In other words, it's sinful. A lot of other religions do this sort of thing. Christianity asks a lot more of you and requires to do things you might not be too comfortable doing as well as repenting from things you find pleasurable. It's difficult, but it's more fulfilling at least in my experience, and gives one a lot more clarity. It's challenging at times, but it is definitely worth it when you know there is a God that loves you, who sent His son to die for you, knows all and will help you through anything (in ways you probably won't expect lol). Another thing is that it's pretty much the only religion that atheists attack. That might make it seem as if Christianity has the most flaws, but in the times of the Bible and when Jesus was here, people hated Him for speaking the truth. He was beaten, mocked, scorned, and as we all know, crucified. Christianity is still very much hated on today. You see a lot of atheists that come on this subreddit just to attack Christians for their beliefs. Atheists are very eager to prove us wrong, and its our belief that its because sin still has a hold on them and they don't like to acknowledge the truth. Oh, and one more thing. Today's world looks a LOT like how the Bible describes the last days. The Bible says there will be rumors of war,  natural disasters will occur more often, Israel will be reestablished, knowledge will increase, and most importantly, there will be scoffers. People will say, ""well, if Jesus is coming back, then where is he? For things have been the same all this time."" Also, I think 2 Timothy 3:1-5 pretty much captures today's society in one single verse:  ""But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God— having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people."""
Christianity,ffgekyo,t1_fffzr0u,1579904492.0,"God lets bad things happen to us. He lets us experience adversity to grow and learn lessons. He wants us to trust in Him no matter what happens and follow His plan for our lives, because He uses our life experiences and hardships in ways we can’t see. Being loved and fulfilled as a person does not mean having a perfect life here on earth, it means putting Jesus at the center of your life and finding happiness in Him. I’ll be praying for you, and also, here’s a video I think might explain this better than I can- https://youtu.be/SCXuq02upvY"
Christianity,ffg5kvn,t1_fffk07v,1579898937.0,"Jesus of Nazareth was in fact a real person, atheists know that. The debate is wether He is God and if His miracles are real, and we believe He is Lord and He did perform miracles.
One of the main reasons I think the Bible couldn’t have been “made up” like most atheists believe is that the Bible has shockingly little detail. It is nothing at all like a fictional story. The Bible is eyewitness accounts of the miracles performed by Jesus Christ, which most atheists don’t like to acknowledge. They were just writing the events that happened, not making a fantastic fictional story. Another thing: people look for better proof outside of the Bible, but the truth is, the best proof of God is in the Bible BECAUSE it’s the best evidence.
Another question that cant really be explained by atheists is how consciousness came to be from material matter. There is nothing to suggest that you can make human consciousness, self awareness, and intelligence out of material matter without some higher being.
Another thing is that it makes the most sense for God not to provide us with undeniable proof, or to not “speak from the clouds” as some people say. God loves us, and He also gave us free will. We have to choose to love Him. He doesn’t provide us with undeniable proof of His existence, because then what choice would we have? If one doesn’t love God, but then sees irrefutable proof of Him and then chooses to love Him know that they have seen God, was it really their choice at all?
Also, just personal experiences. But it takes a lot to be able to experience God. It requires you to get over your own ego and your own view of things and consider the possibility there is something greater than you that made you and loves you. Just forget everything else and be in His presence. One second in the Lord’s presence can change your life more than anything on earth can in a million years."
