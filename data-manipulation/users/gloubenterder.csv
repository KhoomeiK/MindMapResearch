The pIqaD alphabet that klingonists use does not have any logograms; it is a phonetic alphabet, and each syllable must contain at least two letters.

It's worth noting that prior to *Star Trek: Discovery*, this alphabet did not really correspond to on-screen text, which was purely decorative. As such, the shirt's use of the alphabet is in keeping with the TV shows."
