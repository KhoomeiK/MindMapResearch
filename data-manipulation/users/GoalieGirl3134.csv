tonsilstones,ff1oek9,t1_ff1nwf2,1579482606.0,"It’s a combo. I have a large lighted magnifying mirror for viewing, and I was gifted a pair of tweezers that have a light incorporated in the middle. Game changer for me. I don’t use them for digging, but being able to get that little light inside my mouth has been invaluable. The actual tool is a two-headed metal comedone extractor. For whatever reason, this combo works and I don’t gag."
cats,fezti61,t3_eqyh8r,1579461457.0,I found one of these in my favorite color a couple years ago and the husband talked me out of getting it....100% still regret. We were actually just talking about it yesterday.
tonsilstones,fezrpoz,t3_equ2fb,1579460794.0,"You might just need to keep experimenting with different ""tools""? I have a strong gag reflex (brushing the back of my tongue makes me gag 100% of the time) and I had no luck at all with fingers, toothbrushes, q-tips, etc. Finally found a system that works. Now my removal envy is centered more on these people that get the giant boulders!"

photoclass2020,fevnh9o,t3_ep8wya,1579399350.0,"My main camera is a Canon 7Dii - a DSLR. In many ways, I think it's great for me - growing up, my dad always had Canon SLR's and a Hasselblad, so it was a very natural jump for me to take over his old Canon D60 when he replaced it, and eventually take over his 5Di and now his 5Dii. The 7Dii was a gift from my husband, and overall I love it. The only thing that bothers me a lot of the time is the crop sensor - especially when he pushes me to use an 85mm lens (instead of the 50mm I was reaching for) in areas where there's limited room to shoot. I'm only just starting to understand the effect of a crop sensor, but it makes sense why I get so exasperated at having to back up further than I expected to fit something in my frame.

I'm not really sure I'm in a place to change systems anytime soon. While I know they've taken huge strides in the last few years, and in fact some professionals I really admire (like Paul Nicklen) now use them, but to me mentally, mirrorless still feels like the equivalent of a compact camera. I'm just not ready to make that jump. I like the heft of a DSLR in my hands - it feels like a ""real camera"" to me. It could be fun to someday try the exotics, but I think that given my current level of knowledge and experience, that's an experiment that is still years of practice away."
photoclass2020,fevjdl8,t3_en64fn,1579398109.0,"I most often shoot with a Canon 7DII right now, although I also have a hand-me-down 5DII from my dad that I want to start practicing with more. For the sake of a wider comparison, I thought it would also be fun to include a little Olympus Tough TG-5 that I picked up to try playing with for some underwater shots until I can afford (read: convince myself I'm good enough to afford AND save enough money for) underwater housing for one of the bigger DSLR's. For the most part, the two Canons seem fairly comparable (aside from the crop sensor for the 7Dii), but the Olympus was better than I expected. I don't know what sensor-shift IS is, btu I'm curious about it. Not surprised that the Olympus had more focus points than the 5Dii - it's a lot newer!

photoclass2020,fev9ver,t3_eleotm,1579394889.0,"Work's been crazy and I have definitely fallen behind on these. I responded to someone else's photographer choice (and found a lot of new ones I liked in the process) but never got around to posting my own. So, gonna try and make up for it today!

The photographer I chose for this assignment was Jarrod Castaing. I picked a name at random from Australia and when I went to look at his work, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really loved it. 

[Aurora Borealis and the Milky Way over Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/photocontest/detail/altered-images/aurora-borealis-and-the-milky-way-over-jokulsarlon-glacier-lagoon-south-coa/) 

I wasn't surprised that I was drawn to this photo. I love bright colors, and while Jarrod's work seems to have an abundance of that, this is by far the most vibrant of anything he's published. It does almost make me wonder if the colors are a little too enhanced, but I find myself not caring with this image. It almost reminds me of a sunset. 

What keeps me looking? Aside from the color, I really like how this was composed. The green:magenta ratio is a pretty nice 2/3 to 1/3, but if I keep looking, I like that the landscape itself is also in thirds (stars, mountains/clouds, and lake). That purple cloud and bright star dead center draw my eyes to the middle, but there are so many interesting elements (stars, chunks of ice, interplay of colors) that make almost a circle around it, so my eyes keep moving all over the frame."

Veterinary,fepvydd,t1_febr9ep,1579333260.0,"Fantastic advice. I've been a veterinary CSR for almost 9 years (and now I'm in charge, oh God) and this is almost word for word what I tell all of my new trainees. We use that handbook as a huge part of our training, too.

I was a waitress and bartender for 7 years before this. There might be something wrong with my brain."
Moissanite,fe0qk6f,t3_ema07m,1578817486.0," [I have one:](https://imgur.com/TPIP5tc) Center stone is moissanite, but the surrounding ""waves"" are light and dark teal diamonds and dark blue sapphires."
photoclass2020,fdpwrdp,t1_fdl53rx,1578643739.0,"Thank you so much for showing me Justin Minns' work! I am really drawn to the....softness of his images. I usually love really bold, saturated colors, but there is something beautiful and kind of ""secretive"" about what he's done here. I'm sure some of it has to do with the movement from the long exposure, and how he uses that to lead your eye all around the frame. I'm especially taken with the ones that involve a chunk of ice on the shoreline."
photoclass2020,fdh6edb,t1_fdd5jcj,1578416364.0,"Thank you for the feedback! I agree, I'm getting a lot of notes about too much bokeh and need to learn from it :) But this is why we're doing the class, right? 

I did consider cropping that photo of the moon and the branches, but I just couldn't find a crop I liked in Lightroom. Interestingly, looking at it in Imgur (as a much larger export than what I saw while editing) makes it much more clear about possible crops. It also shows me why there's too much bokeh. I don't think I realized it until I saw the photos on a larger scale and had to scroll down to fully view the vertical ones. 

And yes, there likely was some motion blur - I was around F2 (or lower) and 1/90 for a lot of these, which is slower than I like to shoot, and I still had to fix exposure a bit in post. In retrospect, I should have bumped my ISO up a little more to help compensate, or tried playing a bit with AP."
photoclass2020,fdh5rbi,t1_fddly0q,1578415971.0,"Thank you for the feedback. The bystander shadow in the first was meant to be a little tongue-in-cheek since it was a Do Not Enter sign, but I can see how that wouldn't be clear. I can certainly understand how the super shallow DOF feels like chaos on a lot of these. I'll work on challenging myself to compensate for low light with other options aside from aperture, or at least to balance it and not go as shallow."
photoclass2020,fdh5alr,t1_fdd5lbw,1578415689.0,"Thank you for the feedback. Based on what everyone is saying, I probably should have tried for more depth of field. I was attempting to try for photos that didn't all look like the same thing over and over, but I don't think that worked out the way I hoped. 

Boat ramp was at the other end of the parking lot and way further than 10 steps."
photoclass2020,fdd122r,t1_fdczjsx,1578290593.0,"I like that you really took to heart the direction to look up, look down, and get down! :)  I especially like how you framed the edges of the fifth photo with the grass. For my critique, I would say make sure to pay attention to whether your horizon is straight. Also, when looking up, don't go so far that you cut off all but the very tops of the trees. Overall, good job."
photoclass2020,fdd035i,t3_ek38sk,1578289579.0,"Well, here goes. My husband and I drove 10 minutes out of town down one of the back roads. I saw a lot of places I liked as the timer ticked past the 5 minute mark, the 7 minute mark, the 9 minute mark...and I think I might have developed a little bit of an eye twitch watching them go by. The first place to safely pull over was a boat ramp to the Sacramento River, so, to attempt to stay in the spirit of the assignment, I stayed in the parking lot. I shot in RAW, so these have been edited in Lightroom.
