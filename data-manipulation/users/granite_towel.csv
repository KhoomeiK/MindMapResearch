I felt imposter syndrome because I had a weak academic background, rejected by other UCs, yet was still admitted. Don't completely dismiss imposter syndrome, bc there may be some truth in being an ""imposter"". Imo, the best way to get rid of imposter syndrome (from my limited experience), is just to do better and improve right now so you become more confident.

college,fdmt4os,t3_em6rfe,1578564498.0,"Range

I think you should take some derivatives to find mins and maxes. A related observation is that the min should be at least zero bc of the sqrt. Then, find the positive and negative infinity limits of the function. This should give some intuition about how the function behaves. It will also give you the horizontal adymptotes for this particular problem which is important for range. 

Domain

Domain should be all real positive numbers bc of the sqrt. That is, except for when you divide by zero. This results in a hole or vertical asymptote which is important for domain.

It conflicted with taking the SAT lol. I wanted to mention it to show that I possibly could have gotten further but I agree it takes up too much space. Also, this technically wasn't an official award since I didn't win the contest, only got to the final round. Should I keep it?


> What does ""Collaborated with partners with Git"" mean?

I wanted to mention collaboration because otherwise it would seem that this was completely my own project even though I had help.

> While highlighting soft skills like collaboration is good, I think you should explain what you did or used for front/backend since you already have a project showing that you can use git.


frontend was html and css (with bootstrap if that's worth mentioning) while backend was ruby on rails. For each of those posts, messages, and comments you could  create, edit, and delete. I assumed it was implied that these operations were implemented since it honestly felt very basic.

Based on your feedback, I have three ideas (so far) for changes:

* elaborate the collaboration part to make it more clear

* add a bullet point going more in depth in front/backend

* replace the collaboration part with the in more depth part


What change(s) do you suggest I make?"
