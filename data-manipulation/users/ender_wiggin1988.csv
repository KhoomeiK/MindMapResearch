Astronomy,ff10tmn,t3_epqvfj,1579474105.0,This is why we need to establish a presence on the moon. We can continue astronomical observations without concern for the tens of thousands of satellites that will populate orbit in the near future.

changemyview,feklyer,t1_fekcc7t,1579202806.0,"Partially true. Education is part of preventive care, however, and we can't simply lay the blame at the feet of people who are raised to believe erroneous things about their own health. Blame shouldn't be the objective anyhow."
changemyview,fekh9ai,t1_fekda1z,1579200006.0,Easy: socialize the system so the availability of funds is tied directly to government budgets and you can only afford to spend so much on each person. XD
changemyview,fekecad,t1_feitdme,1579198270.0,"People have mentioned in this thread that saying the problem isn't scalable isn't fair, and while I'm not convinced it isn't scalable I can't help but point out no universal health care system exists that handles anywhere near the number of people and governments (50 states) as our own except China, and a quick google search of the Chinese socialist health care system will tell you everything you need to know about what a horror show it is."
changemyview,fekb28i,t1_fejkcsr,1579196324.0,"Of course per capita costs are higher, we have a $2,000,000 MRI machine in every single hospital across 50 states basically."
changemyview,fekas8f,t1_fejm72w,1579196161.0,"Even people with basic insurance find their coverage is perfectly decent. Most insurance is provided through work or state programs.

This idea that only rich Americans are able to afford health care is bonkers, the majority of the patient population are middle class or below."
changemyview,fekakdk,t1_fejkc7y,1579196033.0,"Me: Comparing the U.S. system to execution by dictatorship is hyperbolic.

u/AperoBelta: American healthcare is LITERALLY mass murder.

I guess a Russian would know huh.

You do understand that MOST Americans afford healthcare just fine, through work, private insurance, state programs, etc. The country isn't LITERALLY filled with people dying of heart disease swamping the streets."
changemyview,fekab30,t1_fejln1s,1579195882.0,"This is a highly accurate statement. 

Socialized healthcare systems are great because they emphasize preventative care. In America, lifestyle related illness is one of our most prevalent healthcare concerns.

It's easier and cheaper to provide healthcare to everyone when your population in large part is 1) Not very diverse by race, culture or lifestyle and 2) Already fairly healthy for the most part."
changemyview,feka3tf,t1_fejndvp,1579195763.0,"How much lower ARE outcomes? 
https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/quality-u-s-healthcare-system-compare-countries/#item-start

While more Americans rely on emergency services than in peer nations and higher rates of medical errors, we crush it with cancer survival rates, post-op sepsis and DVT rates, and the U.S. remains a global leader in medical standards and practice of care.

University research accounted for 5% of the $170,000,000,000 spent on medical R&D in 2016.
Private industry?
67%

The halo isn't painted on; Canada, Sweden, England, etc, they all benefit from this by not having to research their own drugs and technologies. They just buy what the U.S. health care industry produces."
