I know that the abusive and manipulative person is still in there. But we get along so much better now that I have taken back my power from her.

AskReddit,fc6jy7s,t3_egh8ye,1577482364.0,"   I currently work in a pediatric therapy clinic. Meaning that not only adult employees, but children are filmed on the toilet. We signed various documents upon employment, so I'm not sure if I've somehow given some type of written consent. I'm sure that being filmed while in the bathroom would NEVER under any circumstances be okay with me, and I'm pretty confident that the parents of these kids would feel the same way. 

   Found out after opening the lobby door today to return an office phone. The new desk attendant was away and there were three live camera feeds left on the screen. On one I could see kids playing, and one was an image of the inside of the bathroom. I've noticed a green light coming from a small gap in two of the ceiling tiles but honestly didn't want to believe that my privacy would be violated so harshly by my employer. 

Honestly, I just feel really hurt and disgusted, and glad that one of my co-workers wasn't using the bathroom when I walked up to the monitor. Definitely do not want to see that. The screen does face the door leading from the offices so basically anyone could accidentally end up seeing something that they shouldn't. 

Anyone have advice on how this should not approached? (In Michigan, U.S. if relevant)"
