lrcast,ffy6m07,t1_ffy3ql5,1580339561.0,"Having a 60 card deck means your deck will be worse quality than a 40 card deck from the same pool of cards, yes.

That does NOT mean that every 60 card deck is worse than every 40 card deck, especially in a format as volatile as Limited. It is very possible that their 60 card deck was better than your 40  card deck, and assuming that every 60 card deck is automatically worse than a 40 card deck is a fallacy.

 This is especially true in lower levels of play where drafters have large differences in skill level. Your opponent may ha e been a better drafter than you, but they dont know about the minimum deck size rule. Your opponent might have been goofing around. Or maybe they messed up in Arena and accidentally registered a 60 card deck.

60 card decks -imply- a worse deck, but they dont automatically mean it. Similarly, if your opponent has played 3 boardwipes and they have 1 card in hand, this -implies- that they dont have one in hand, but that's not always true either.

lrcast,ffw16mg,t3_evinsw,1580280035.0,"Without seeing the full game and/or decklists, it's really hard to answer this question. Perhaps you chose value-oriented lines of play when you should have chosen aggression-oriented. Perhaps you started swinging too late. 

FWIW, this is one of the issues with Bo1. In Bo3 you could have used information from your first game to adjust your playstyle; if you know your opponent has a higher topend, you know to drop the curve of your deck and start swinging sooner for games 2 and 3. But in Bo1, you can't really utilize that information, and you're a bit more reliant on luck. You can't intuitively know what cards your opponent is running in Limited, and this is especially true when your opponent is playing a janky deck. Games 2 and 3 often come down to skill moreso than game 1 because you have an opportunity to use what you've learned about your opponent's deck against them.

>How do you begin to approach the multi-turn math to break the stall?

Just do the math. Predict your opponent's blocks if you swing with everything (there's usually a pretty clear answer with only some variation based on what they have in hand) then evaluate that board state, and evaluate what will happen if you swing in again. Is there a chance you'll get lethal if you swing with everything each turn? No? Then you probably shouldn't be alpha striking unless you have something in hand. Can you swing and trade favorably with a few creatures?

At some point, you have to accept that you've 'lost' because your opponent has stalled out the board. You can't break every board stall; that's your opponent's win condition. 

Also, just because your opponent has 60 cards in their deck doesn't mean they have a worse deck. i see this fallacy a lot. People underestimate their opponent because they observe one common pitfall and assume their opponent is a noob all around. Your opponent can absolutely have a finely tuned list of 60 cards (that they either manufactured purposefully or lucked into). Sure, their list is worse for having 60 cards. But their 60 card list could still be better than your 40 card list. Or, their list might just line up nicely against yours."

>you don't sideboard Bronzehide Lion against control because the deck become more midrange thanks to his sideboard, it means he is more effective in this proper environement post changement.

Please rephrase this as I'm having a lot of trouble parsing what you're saying. This card is bad vs control whether or not you're a midrange deck post-board. If I had a maindeck Lion in an aggro deck, it would be one of the cards I look to board out for either a more aggressive 2 drop or a more value 2 drop, depending on which way I'm pivoting.

> You don't bring Steamkin on the table anymore ? a 1/1 that does nothing in turn 2, surprising

That's because Mono Red doesn't see play. Steamkin still gets included in mono red when it's run. It's a 1/1 that does nothing on turn 2, but it swings as a 2/2, 3/3, or even 4/4 on turn 3, and it has value when chained with spells on turns after turn 2. It can win the game if ignored for even a couple turns, so it demands removal ASAP. That's a great 2 drop.

>Brineborn is play in a heavy counter spell deck, this card heavily rely on his environment, that's totally different, on her own this wouldn't do much, this is the whole environment around this card that protect her and make her shine.

Every single card in every single deck is reliant on its enviornment. Brineborn  enables aggressive openings in a counterspell deck. It's what one looks for in a 2 drop; something that enables aggressive openings in a certain kind of deck.

Vraska, Vivien Arkbow, Chandra, Teferi. Gideon, Tibalt, and Royal Scions for a mana cheaper... all cards  I'd run long before Mantle 

>A krasis for 4 ? 

Yes, pros Krasis for 4 all the time. The strength of the card is that you can cast it for 4, 6, 8, or more. It's both a lategame card advantage bomb and a cheap threat that cantrips; if you aren't casting it for the latter sometimes, you're missing out on a lot of its flexible power.

>Mantle provides 4 haste power that let 4 power on the board after a board wipe or removal, that's totally powerfull and it could not cost less, the only requirement is to have one dude on the board,

Except it's a huge tempo and card disadvantage to spot removal, making it terrible vs control specifically. Compare this card to Awakening of Vhitu-Ghazi. I'd rather run Ghazi (it's even an instant!), but really I wouldn't want to run either.

>Bronzehide Lion that can be indestructible, Hunted witness, ect... it should not be difficult. Questing Beast isn't more powerfull than that, it depends a lot of the situation.

""Only being exiled"" is not long term value. The card generates no value if.it sticks; it just beats. Being indestructible is not value. It is a -valuable- effect, but that's not what 'generating value' refers to. The card is bad if chumped. Cards like Steamkin and Rix Maadi are not.

Go back and look at all the aggro 2 drops in this format and the past few. Almost all of them do things the turn they come down, or demand an answer the turn they come down.

Lion does not. Its chumpable for a long time, it wont win the game alone if its left alive, and its easy to remove because it demands 2 mana if you want it to be indestructible (and it's still vulnerable to exile). It's not what an aggro deck in recent Standard is looking for. I think it's best bet is making it in Selesnya Weenies, but I dont think that'll be a deck without some other sort of engine, and that engine would probably be Adventures (I doubt there's support for an aggro-leaning Enchantress deck but who knows). If it makes it into an aggro deck, I think it's going to be used vs other aggro decks, not vs control.

It's much more effective as a midrange card, where it clogs the board and serves as a strong anti aggro 2 drop, while still being a reasonable beater vs control, especially if you have 2 spare mana to leave up (which midrange frequently has). Midrange also has a large density of must-remove threats, and forcing removal on a cheap card like this weakens their game vs you especially when you have the time and draw to hit more threats. Think about how Aggro decks dont run Legion Warboss, but control decks often do. Warboss is good because it forces removal early (upping your threat density) while also often leaving behind a bit of value. It's bad in aggro because its slow and there are better threats for outright winning the game. That's how I view Lion."

What I'm saying is that they're different enough that you can't discount one card just because the other one is bad. The things that make Vannifar unplayable aren't present in the new card. I know you're not saying they're the same, but you're making an argument that they're so similar that the new one must be bad. Do you understand now?

No, I've been contrasting them.

>That would be a terrible comparison because the effects are nowhere near the same.

Yes, that's what I'm saying. Vannifar and Incarnation have effects with similar text (""pod a creature"", ""draw a card"") but the implementation of the effects makes them far different.

>How so? Vannifar ability is essentially a 3 card engine that feeds itself. You sac a creature to get another creature and sac it again to feed itself.

Vannifar needs to survive a full turn, on turn 4, and it needs to survive every form of creature removal, which is the most common form of removal. It's inconsistent because your deck is built around the card, and if you can't resolve it, you're playing a bad midrange deck and you're off tempo.

Either way, the core piece you're missing is that in these decks, most if not all of your enchantments are creatures (and yes, there are plenty of good enchantment creatures). You sac an enchantment (creature), pull out a creature (enchantment), and you can continue the pod next turn from that creature. You're not playing and saccing jank removal enchantments, because then the core of your deck would be shit.

And there are plenty of strong enchantment creatures to fill a majority of your deck. Many have good ETBs, and others are creatures you're happy to end your chain on anyhow.

It's ikely not a tier 1 deck, but it's a hell of a lot better than Vanniar which was a tier 3 strategy at best, and this is coming from someone who's played a Vannifar variant every set since RNA. 4 mana creatures that need to survive a turn are inherently weak. 4 mana enchantments that need to survive till end step are stronger. Just because they both pod something doesn't mean they can be compared; you wouldnt compare [[Mulldrifter] and [Keeper of Tales] just because they both draw cards, would you? The way you go about executing those effects is also relevant, and this card executes its effect far more reliably than Vannifar.

And yeah, people are gonna run ench removal, but it's still not going to come near the amount of.creature removal in the format. Creatures are inherently more fragile than artifacts/enchantments."

spikes,fdimimb,t1_fdhj6it,1578446222.0,"It's way better than vannifar. Vannifar is a super powerful effect attached to an easy to remove, summoning sick creature. 

Birthing Pod was good because it was an artifact (harder to remove) and it could be used the turn it comes down. This is an enchantment (harder to remove) and also can be used the turn it comes down.

It's also very conditional, but it's definitely not fair to compare it to Pod Mom."
spikes,fdikt2v,t1_fdhrjq6,1578445123.0,"I dont think anyone would suggest running this in a non-Enchantress deck, but the point is that you can have a critical mass of targets to keep the spell live without having to resort to bad Auras or durdley enchantments."

You're absolutely right that Gust is a tempo play, but tempo is exactly what a control deck is looking for when a card like Ceratops is played. Ceratops threatens no long-term value, and is cleaned up nicely when you decide to boardwipe or drop a bomb. The threat of Ceratops is if it hits you for 5 or 10 or 15 or 20 damage before you get a chance to draw into your answer, or play lands to cast your answer."

Are you arguing that draw-go is unviable in a Teferi world? That's a more reasonable argument (though it's also debatable, UW control is played in both Standard and Modern) but I'm not going to play Draw-Go, AND THEN exclude this card JUST because of Teferi.

So if it's a divination even half the time, it's a divination with almost no opportunity cost. That's what makes this card powerful. Not that it draws you 3 or 4 or 5 cards (though it absolutely will do that in games) but that draws 1 at very little opportunity cost."
