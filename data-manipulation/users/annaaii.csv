introverts,ffqym5t,t3_euaya4,1580146570.0,"For me, it really depends on how close I am with that person. If they're my close friend but they live far away and we don't have too many opportunities to meet up, we message each other quite frequently, even if it's just sending some memes or complaining about work and personal stuff. That's about two-three people.

Then there are those I'm kinda close with but not quite as much. I either message them when there's a need to do so or if I just want to see what they've been doing lately. 

And then there are those I used to be very close with but then they moved very far away and so communication is a bit tricky (completely different time zones and all). We still message each other every now and then to catch up, but that's about it. When we do meet up though, it feels as if no time passes at all and our friendship naturally 'resumes' from where it was left at. And that's perfectly fine--not seeing each other for a long time doesn't bother me and doesn't make me feel like that person's no longer my friend. 

Now when it comes to your introvert friends not contacting you for a long time, I don't think you should be afraid they've forgotten about you or don't care about you. It's just that introverts generally don't require that much social interaction. This obviously differs for each individual, but if I hang out with someone today, I don't really feel the 'need' to do that again for about a month. That's not to say I wouldn't go out if someone asked me to do so, nor that I wouldn't enjoy it. Unless it was the very next day, which would be awful as it means I didn't have enough time to properly 'recharge'. 

Hope that makes sense?"
introverts,ffqwhqf,t3_eulxc1,1580145223.0,"Being surrounded by people but not having to interact with them is the best, honestly. Going to a cafe to read or do some work on my laptop is one of the things I enjoy the most (or even just going to my favourite restaurant to enjoy some good food by myself). And I absolutely get that ""going on a date with yourself"" feeling--in many ways, it's better than going on a date with someone else. No pressure, no reason to feel anxious, just enjoying your own presence and doing whatever feels right for you.   
My flatmate is also very introverted so we normally share the same kitchen/living room area in the evening, but most of the time we just do our own thing without really interacting with each other. It's amazing. I've had to share flats with other people before and they'd always want to talk to me when we were in the same room, which at times was extremely exhausting."

It might sound like a stupid cliche but I genuinely enjoy the field I'm working in. There are things I don't like about my current job (don't think there is a single person in this world who likes absolutely everything about their job tbh) but I do like the field I work in and I do not regret making this choice, although I did have my doubts while in high school and university. Some projects I get to work on are more interesting than others, naturally, but when I do get a project that I genuinely enjoy, I get up in the morning and I'm looking forward to getting there and getting work done. So although some tasks and projects are repetitive, I can't say I dread doing them. 

Student debt repayment differs from country to country, but here you only start paying once you earn a certain amount of money and they also do not take that much out of your account every month. If you earn more than the threshold, you start paying the debt but if you get another job that pays less for example, or if you become unemployed, they'll stop taking money from your account. Also, after about 30 years or so your debt is wiped, even if you haven't paid all of it. So most people I know (who have a full-time and relatively well-paid job) don't really stress out too much about this issue. 

Living in a small apartment isn't a big issue for many people, to be honest. I for one care more about the quality of the apartment I live in than the size. That being said, most apartments are absolute shitholes and it really depends on the compromises you're ready to make.

This is pretty much my case. I didn't like physics in high school, nor maths. I really loved chemistry and biology though and I was pretty good at it too.

I started reading more and more about astrophysics starting with my last year in high school/beginning of university. The very first books I picked up were Stephen Hawking's, followed by Brian Greene and others. There was a lot that didn't make sense at first, so I re-read them a couple of times and had long, long conversations with my dad (who studied physics in university) once I was done.

The moment I realised just how much I love this, though, was about two years ago when I went back home for the summer vacation and I was just lying down on the grass in our back yard with my parents, watching the Perseids. Everything was so quiet and peaceful, at some point it almost felt as if there was no ground underneath us anymore. Looking at the sky, while also knowing more about the way things work, about how there are different type of stars, how they go supernova and then spread their elements throughout the universe, allowing for other celestial bodies to form...is quite a unique feeling. It doesn't seem that big if you look at the sky with the naked eye, but then you remember that it is mind-bogglingly big and at first you feel very tiny and insignificant until you remember that even if that might be true, you are undoubtedly part of this universe, you are connected to not just the planet you live on but to the universe as a whole.

I did not say I want people

>to be forced to share the same belief as me

 and then

>be shunned and removed

if they don't. That's what you assumed I'm trying to say, and I'm not responsible for the assumptions you make.

Objective truth and critical thinking are not beliefs."

atheism,fe1qn8i,t1_fe1pkir,1578829710.0,"Where have I said any of that? You're just putting words in my mouth.

In my original comment, I have mentioned teachers who forced me to do things against my will and then threatened me, as well as atheists being executed for not believing in god. I then said none of this is okay. 

Where in this have I said that I want people to be forced to believe what I believe?"
atheism,fe1ko46,t1_fe1jmuc,1578827666.0,"I want truth and rational, critical thinking to be accepted everywhere, yes."
atheism,fe134la,t1_fdztcgt,1578821941.0,"Whenever I hear that ""why can't you just let people believe"" bs I am very tempted to tell them well why don't you tell that to my actual teachers who forced me to pray and go to the church and then threatened me, as a child, just because I dared question their holy bible? Why don't you tell that to the atheists living in countries where atheism is punishable by death?
Of course we're angry. None of this is okay. If they refuse to accept that the world is bigger than what's around them, it's not our problem."
depression,fe1264b,t3_engd6e,1578821672.0,"Watched it twice and every time it gave me this feeling that I still can't describe properly. It makes me feel uneasy, uncomfortable, scared at times, then sad and a bit hurt but in the same time it can be so relatable. At times, it feels like a hug."
socialskills,fe0rvk7,t1_fdz4n84,1578817900.0,I agree with this completely. It would make me feel miserable if I had to actually spend time doing this just to have better social interactions with coworkers.

saltierthancrait,fdu3c2e,t1_fdsq0fs,1578726786.0,"Agree. John is such a big star wars fan and his character had so much potential, he deserved better.

I love that this community (and all other people I've talked to who didn't like the sequels) supports the actors instead of harassing them like people did after the prequels were released. 

May the salt be with you, always."

YouShouldKnow,fdqdg5c,t1_fdq7f1x,1578663737.0,No one's asking anyone to change? Just to be understandable.
YouShouldKnow,fdqdeyd,t1_fdq9gy0,1578663710.0,">Signed, someone who put in the work to change themselves and found it incredibly draining and unfulfilling and Often drew the wrong people to me.

This! I always found it so incredibly exhausting and uncomfortable. At some point, I just gave up and told myself that there's no reason to put myself through this and make myself feel miserable. My family and friends understand and appreciate me, so that's all that matters."
YouShouldKnow,fdqd8il,t1_fdpzlcu,1578663565.0,">It's never my intent to be rude, I'm just an introvert with social anxiety. I'll talk when people talk to me but I don't go out of my way to initiate conversation all the time. I also hate small talk but I can gush all day about a subject I'm passionate about.

Exactly the same for me!

I don't really talk unless I have something to say. If there's something that happened and I want to share it, I'll share it with my parents or my close friends, but that's about it. I've noticed that most people at work enjoy sharing stuff with each other, talking about their day/vacation and stuff. I just don't like doing that. If someone comes and asks me about my weekend or whatever, my replies are never very long because I just don't feel like sharing with them. Somehow, I think this is seen as anti-social behavior? 

If they were to talk to me about something I'm truly passionate about (unfortunately, my co-workers and I don't seem to have much in common) they'd probably beg me to stop talking. But again, I'm not talking about things I'm passionate about unless you're close to me, you ask about it, or you are also passionate about said thing."
YouShouldKnow,fdqbu0f,t1_fdpvnsm,1578662383.0,"> it takes the right kind of environment for him to actually relax enough to engage with everyone

This is exactly the same for me. People seem to have a rather narrow idea of what a sociable and 'nice' person should look and behave like and if you don't fit into that idea, they automatically assume you hate them or something. In all fairness though, they probably have little to no experience with socially anxious people or people who have any sort of mental illness. So if everyone around them does fit that idea and talks/behaves in a similar way, they'll naturally come to think of that way as the ""normal"". 

Not saying they shouldn't try to be more open-minded though. They absolutely should."
YouShouldKnow,fdqbdcl,t3_emlplf,1578661974.0,Hahah this is 100% me. Slowly learning how to not let it bother me too much while also not forcing myself into situations that make me feel uncomfortable just for the sake of being accepted and being seen as a nice and sociable person.
PrequelMemes,fdq52y6,t1_fdowesq,1578655211.0,"I love the prequels and I agree that some of the dialogue could have been better. It's a fair criticism and blindly defending it doesn't do anyone any good. Some people can't look past that, which is also fair. Personally, it doesn't bother me as much and I can overlook it because the overall story is good and solid and I still like Anakin as a character."
saltierthancrait,fdq07ck,t1_fdnanbf,1578648375.0,"I will never understand people criticising us and going like oh it's just a movie oh don't you have better things to do than complain about it what's the point anyway.
It's not just a movie. That's the thing. Star Wars has never been ""just a movie"". The fact that it is now being turned into ""just a movie"" for the casual movie goer who just wants excitement, action, mindless love scenes and entertainment, is frankly insulting not just to us as fans and the Star Wars legacy but to cinematography."
saltierthancrait,fdq01k9,t1_fdoacu2,1578648148.0,"I'm a woman and I'm gonna defend Anakin Skywalker forever. Rey is a weak and boring character and has no place in Star Wars.
