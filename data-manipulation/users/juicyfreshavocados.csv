AskReddit,fe4gdv1,t3_enpz15,1578859058.0,"I was about 8 or 9 and my school had a court, they held a scooter day where we could bring bikes and scooters and scooter in a circle for about 10 mins. (Part of a reward for people who did work or something). There was this one girl who bullied me a lot and saw me behind her scootering along the track, she swung the tail end of her scooter in front of mine and me and the scooter got sent flying. When I hit the ground my wrist hurt very badly, now the school I was in was shit. No punishment system, the principal was about to leave and so they let bullies get by them pretty much. I went to the nurse after begging and crying to my teacher, I had grazes all over my legs and hands and was bleeding so looking back on it, it was really really bad to not let a kid to the nurse when they’re bleeding and grazed. Anyway I went to the office and they told me that it wasn’t broken and I just had a graze on my hand, (I didn’t), and sent me back to class. The teacher sent me back to the office because I couldn’t write because of the pain. I got picked up from school early and taken to the doctors, turns out I broke 2 small bones in my wrist. It wasn’t super serious so I only had a cast for a few weeks but it hurt like a bitch."

lostredditors,fczajea,t1_fcz0gjm,1578097009.0,Maybe it was intentional and OP was whooshing us all along... mad respect to OP even though they probably just posted on the wrong subreddit on accident.

entitledparents,fbnyq72,t3_edvumx,1577004841.0,"Damn Brad is sounds like such a breath of fresh air after dealing with Kevin. I hope that kid’s situation improves, reminds me of how my cousin Lauren (not real name) always has tantrums and she bullies my other cousin Dayan. Lauren’s mother never fucking disciplines her goddamn child while Dayan’s mother is lovely. Dayan is an energetic kid and I’ve seen that little pest hurt herself and cry and blame it on Dayan. Dayan never speaks up for himself but my entitled aunt just lets Lauren get away with murder, Dayan always gets in trouble too."
