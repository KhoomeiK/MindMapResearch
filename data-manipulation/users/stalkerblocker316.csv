Redskins,ffkfhal,t3_eu2tqv,1580021906.0,"I believe we will trade out with the dolphins. Or any other qb needy team, but the phins could give up 2 of their 1st rounders and a 2nd. Okudah should be there at 5, and we have needs, pass rusher isn’t one.

Edit cause someone replied to me but now I can’t see it-we already have good pass rushers, and I’m usually a bpa advocate, but we’re not even mediocre, as I believe you put it, let’s get to that point first. 
I’d love to have Chase, but drafting a position you’re already strong at when you have glaring holes elsewhere and can get 2-3 day 1 starting quality players is asinine. We literally had walk ons and practice squad guys starting!
That being said, if we don’t trade out of 2 then yes, you absolutely take Chase. I also think Miami has the only draft capital that would sway us, no way we’re taking less than 2 firsts"

DIY,ff3v9uz,t3_erfcpb,1579549612.0,I stopped scrolling so this might have been said already but it sounds like you need a new thermostat. Most big box hardware stores will have $20-$30 thermostats. Your landlord is in the wrong in that they should have sent someone or checked it themselves. Never tell/allow a tenant to work on or attempt to diagnose any problem.
