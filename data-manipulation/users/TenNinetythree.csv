bridezillas,fg1d7xu,t1_fg05mk3,1580425048.0,"What I mean is that they are in a bigger risk of becoming ill from an illness a normal immune system might fight off and that the illness would be far harsher on the person. I'd just be afraid another guest has something and might cause that person a huge issue. I am not a doctor, so I would ask them to clear this plan with their oncologist and not decide myself, as I am not an MD. I would just be afraid someone went there despite being slightly sick and causing an issue.
