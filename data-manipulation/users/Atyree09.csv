worldnews,ffn2x14,t3_eu5zl5,1580061447.0,SIL has coworkers going to Beijing in the next few days for three weeks. SIL is notorious for not washing her hands. We live in the same house as SIL. My daughter is an 8m old preemie. Going to go live in the woods for a few months.
JUSTNOFAMILY,ffiep3y,t3_etrqww,1579972083.0,"Oh lawd this happened to me.

SIL said: “I wish (her daughters name) was chunky like that, but then again not”
SILs cousin: “yeah, you don’t want your baby to be fat”
 
Like wtf. Fat-shaming babies because you two are jealous hens."
Dentistry,ff72g67,t3_es0sf4,1579639779.0,I’m getting worried about her geminated tooth. It’s starting to become harder to clean and the other side is getting irritated. There’s not much room for it to come in any further and it’s pushing her other teeth to the side.
FancyFollicles,ff54ncg,t1_ff4yx2r,1579580116.0,I was trying to research a bit and it seems like Wella T14 is blue-purple based. Would that be good to try?
Onision,ff4e04q,t3_ergka5,1579561367.0,"As a father, how could you sit there, eat food, film a video, and completely ignore that your SO is screaming at your kids and they are crying for you.

He’s  a piece of garbage.

Edit: Switched mother to father. Completely forgot that Kai identifies as a male because his children said “mommy”."
FancyFollicles,ff47mvs,t3_erkd4l,1579557310.0,"Went and got highlights done, but came out with almost blond hair and the toner had lifted my natural hair color to this beautiful orange.

I honestly just want it more even looking. Wasn’t going for anything specific (well, I was. I just wanted highlights in my ash brown hair and now I’m blond again lol)."
AskReddit,ff08uvw,t3_equ4vm,1579466432.0,"Probably wrestling. I don’t think anyone understands how much we wrestle. 

We should probably stop because now our two year old wants to be tagged in and she is vicious."
AskReddit,feweupr,t3_eqjrvi,1579409416.0,"Minecraft, Sims, and stronghold.

I like building things apparently."

college,feexel0,t3_eomjwv,1579043301.0,"I study when my daughter naps. So two 1-2 hour intervals a day. If I’m reading a textbook, I take a break every thirty minutes to let my brain rest. If I feel like I need to go review topics, I’ll write them down or do the questions at the end of the chapter.

Have to add that my learning is online, so it’s quite different than going to class and studying on top of that. I feel like learning in intervals or many short sessions has been most beneficial."
YouShouldKnow,fecptci,t1_fecprbx,1578980280.0,"I’ll research a bit more then and see what we can do.

Thank you!"
YouShouldKnow,fecpnz7,t1_fecpgxd,1578980147.0,"I found a company online that will do a will for $140. Do you think there is any validity in that? We mainly just want one person to be guardian to our children and dog, and we want to have like three gifts given to them. We don’t have any other assets or any financial accounts that are worth mentioning."
YouShouldKnow,feciczv,t3_eob76n,1578974633.0,"What is a good way to get a will inexpensively? We are in our 20’s and have two kids. At this particular time, we don’t have a lot of extra income to get a lawyer."
