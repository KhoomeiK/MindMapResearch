POTS,ffh95w6,t1_ffh46fh,1579926717.0,"Ok. It could still be POTS. Does your blood pressure / heart rate get crazy when you change from laying to sitting to standing or any variation? I saw someone asked if you tried the poor mans tilt table test yet. Even though you're coming off of the beta blockers, I feel it wouldn't hurt to try it now (especially cause your complaint was it made your breathing weird, you never mentioned if it made your actual symptoms worse). 

Irreguardless, I think it could help if you do it now, and take it again when you're completely off of the beta blockers. That way you can see if the beta blockers *did* do any good, or if it really didn't touch things at all. And you can compare both results to see if you do have POTS or not. If one of them shows you do, try a third time later and see what it shows. Hope I make sense.

Do you suffer from anxiety? Anxiety really can cause a lot of issues. An anxiety or panic attack can even have similar symptoms of a heart attack, so imagine what just regular anxiety can do to your body. Is there a lot of stress you have going on that could attribute to things?

How long ago did you last do drugs, and what was it? What did you use the most of? Drugs of any sort can cause health issues. How did you use Adderall? Did you snort it, or ingest it? Despite what your doctor has mentioned, misuse of Adderall can cause tachycardia and other heart related issues. Adderall is a stimulant, which just like caffeine and other stimulants, used too much or too long can cause you serious issues. [Read this article for more information on the effects Adderall can have on your body](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/adderall/long-term-effects).

I hate to say it but depending on your answers for the drug questions, you may have caused your own health issues, and may not be POTS after all, and just an unfortunate condition you've developed due to misuse of drugs. I hope I am wrong, but I urge you to still do the tilt table test irregardless to help further rule everything out."
POTS,ffh75wz,t1_ffh68s1,1579925011.0,"I would say then that caffeine is unfortunately your enemy here. Find decaf and caffeine free, and try to limit as much as you can."
tellmethesunnyside,ffh723p,t3_etg8ro,1579924923.0,"First off, it sounds like your parents are not the greatest people in the world and have helped to contribute your current state of mind. It is not right that they compare you to others. Not everyone is extroverted and enjoys big parties.

So, first sunny side up to consider is you are only 18. You have a **lot** of life yet to live. Get out from living with your parents at the earliest, most feasible time would probably help you out the most.

The girl? Forget her. Right now you need to focus on you. You realize you have an anger issue going on, which means you are a bigger man than your own dad (alcoholic but won't admit it, and here you are admitting to internet strangers you realize you have issues being angry, congrats on being mature enough to face your own fault, something your own father hasn't achieved!). Take this victory and run with it. You know you have this going on, do you think it's wise trying to get a girlfriend right now while you have this chaos going on? I wouldn't say so, but no worries, you've got a long time to find that special girl.

May I ask what your dreams were? Looking at a career based on how it will take care of your retirement and your bills is a completely rational decision, however I hope you don't seriously think being a cop is the only job that qualifies for this. I am sure there's got to be more that can fit this for you.

So, let's recap. You're 18. You have a **lot* of time to discover and achieve your life / career / girlfriend / etc. You are able to realize and admit to a fault you have, something your own father struggles with, showing you have in your own ways surpassed your ""role models"" (because parents should be our first role models in life). And last, but not least, you do realize looking for a career that will take care of your bills and retirement is something to consider, even if it (sadly) means you may not be able to follow your dreams. That is a harsh reality to face. However, I still would like to know what your dreams are (were?).

Also, I feel every 16-24 year old goes through this. I certainly did, as did my friends. The sudden change of going from ""child"" to ""I'm an adult, what do I do with my life?"" is a hard shift. Realize that you have a lot going for you. Introverts lead good lives too (I am an example). Sure, may not fit the quota of what everyone thinks you should have experienced, but you are your own individual person. Be you, not who others tell you to be.

Good luck, I wish you the best on this very hard journey of yours."
POTS,ffh4vs9,t3_etl8f3,1579923184.0,"Yes, both can change your heart rate.

Stress causes your body to pump more adrenaline. Adrenaline will then cause your heart to pump faster, meaning increased heart rate. 

Caffeine is a stimulant. Depending on how your body reacts to caffeine, you can experience increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, increased blood sugar levels, and an increase of blood to your skin and extremeties. It's stimulating effects can begin to take effect between 15-45 minutes. Depending on the amount of caffeine and how fast your body can metabolize it, the half-life of the caffeine is 5 to 6 hours, meaning these effects can last that long.

Having POTS it is wise to try to limit both as much as you can. Stress is hard to limit, but since you can control your caffeine intake, it would be wise to start drinking decaf or caffeine free. However, do note everyone reacts to caffeine differently. Take notice of how it effects you. Do your symptoms tend to worsen when taking caffeine? Then that is a good sign it probably won't be a bad idea to slow down. My daughter has POTS and caffeine doesn't seem to effect her symptoms, so it's up to you to figure out."
POTS,ffh33x2,t3_etkhkg,1579921806.0,"Even though you are a guy, it is still possible that it's POTS. My daughter has it, and we have no clue how she got it.

Are the symptoms you've listed all you've experienced so far, or is there more? Also, may I ask how old you are (rough estimate is fine.. 20s, 30s etc). 

I hate to ask this, but over the past year have you gained weight? Weight can be difficult on your heart and system.

Is there a history of heart problems in your family? Or high blood pressure?

Also, I assume so, but do you have high blood pressure (if not why are you on beta blockers?)

What is your diet like? Do you eat mostly junk, very healthy, or a mix of the two? Also, what about caffeine?"

EstrangedAdultChild,fff6ypo,t1_ffex4tz,1579877286.0,"I won't deny, I have not attempted to get an apology. However, the reason I never tried does lie with the common form of abuse I had growing up.

My mom (main person I went NC with, but am NC with my whole family) always gaslighted me. The way she did it the most, was telling me that *everything* was my fault. She had a bad day at work? I somehow caused it. Stubbed her toe? I should have had the foresight to move the heavy coffee table for her, and it's now my fault.

Imagine, being about 9 years old, and your mother screaming at you that if it wasn't for you both your father and sister would still be alive. Imagine being told this often after that. Imagine, also, not even knowing *how* your dad died (but know that your sister died when you were 4 from suicide, and she lived in another state). Family won't tell you when you ask, they all just say, ""Ask your mom."" You work up the courage to ask your mother, and she ignores your question, gives you the cold shoulder, or changes the topic. Imagine asking how your dad died multiple times every year since you were in the 3rd grade, to only have the same response.

Imagine being 16, your mother goes through this heavy cedar chest that has who knows what in it. Always been in her bedroom, and also has heavy breakables ontop so you can't look in it unless your mom does. She opens it, pull out some papers, and lets you read them. Imagine being 16, reading the newspaper obituary of your dad, which explains he died **from suicide** when you were only 5 months old. Both people your mother ever accused you of being the cause of their deaths, both died from suicide.

*But wait, there's more!* The obituary also brings some new news to you, and you have no idea how to handle this sudden realization. Found out you have **three** brothers from your dad from a previous marriage of his! You were never told, you're lucky you even know your dads name, knowing anything else is impossible to get! You ask your mother how come she never told you you had 3 other brothers, she responded with, **""You never asked.""**

Slap in the face, but that is but a small example of my upbringing. I see no reason why asking for an apology from my mother would do any good, she'd never do it. Everything had always been my fault in her eyes, so why ask for an apology when she felt she wasn't at fault to begin with? What maturity does she have to admit her mistakes, when she'd repeatedly express that the deaths of certain family members as **my** fault?

So, for me, I know it's pointless. Asking for an apology from her is an impossible task that would only hurt me in the end. I'd be rubbing more salt into my own wound as she expresses my ""faults"" to me.

My mother has a **lot** to come to terms with before any sort of repair in our relationship could happen. I am currently on year 12 since going estranged from her. There's ways she could reach me if she wanted to try, but after the initial hump of my sudden NC she's never tried. 12 years later, I doubt she ever will. She has a son that adores her, and she's never had ill thoughts towards him. He has a wife and kids. She is happily living her life without me, and frankly, I am happy for her. Obviously she was not happy with me. 

My mom had a lot of trauma she had to deal with. I was born with a rare heart disease with a risk of dying before I turned 4, after that I'd be old enough to have a surgery that would increase my chances of survival. 5 months after my birth my dad committed suicide. 3ish years later my sister died, and this was the same time I had my surgery (which I did die for a few moments while recovering, had to be revived). 2 years later my great grandma (so my moms grandma) also died. That's a lot of trauma to have to process, and much more I actually left out. The only way she could deal was to look upon me as the cause of her pain. 

Since going NC, I've been able to look objectively at what I know, and even sympathize with my mother. She had a lot to go through, and didn't have a good enough support system to keep her afloat. Instead, she looked upon me as a source of pain to get past her grief. Is it right? No, but I can understand her thinking now. I can understand how when things got rough she would look at me and be reminded of the traumas she's endured. I would be the constant reminders of the PTSD she had. And, knowing that, means she'd have to radically come to terms with events she's blamed me for, face the pain and trauma all over again and reprocess it differently before she could accept she was at fault and apologize to me for how she raised me. Why put herself through that heartache, now that I am gone and out of the picture when she has another child she can live as mother and grandmother through? Her dark past is out of her way, why change now?

Instead, I will not ask for an apology. I know I will not receive one. I know she is happier now, as am I. I understand now the reasons to which she reacted towards me. I also know what she would have to face before she could admit to herself that she did anything wrong. I can let it go. I am married and have kids. If my husband and child both died by suicide, I can only imagine the pain and horror I would endure as I processed things. I will not ask for an apology that will be impossible to get. Instead, I have moved on. 

I don't know if this will help you at all, but here you go."
crochet,fff2xjd,t1_ffelvvx,1579874269.0,"That's an interesting idea. The slime and putty helps him the most overall, the constant squishing, stretching, almost stress ball qualities is his overall preference. However, sometimes if it hits him and his slimes or putties are not within reach he will reach for a soft plush animal.

I am not expecting this sensory book to replace his preference for slime/putty, rather something else to help him out when he's having a really rough time. If, however, I *am* wrong, I will happily keep your idea in mind. Perhaps, whichever pattern he prefers, I could try and use it to make a hacky sack? No one would really think anything if they saw a teen boy with a hacky sack. Would give additional sensory benefits (whatever I fill it with could give sound and weight). I'll have to play around with it and ask him to see what he thinks."

POTS,ffcldh3,t1_ffcitlb,1579801922.0,"Maybe, if you haven't already, have a heart to heart with him. Sit down and explain what you just did. Ask him why he thinks you are just being lazy, when originally you were a very active person and suddenly struggle with everything. 

He may, unfortunately, just be unwilling to admit you have a condition that effects you this much. He asks your doctor leading questions to get the answers he wants to hear because he is having trouble coming to terms with your condition, and wants to convince himself that the old remedy of diet and exercise is all you need to get past this.

Ask him blatantly if he understands you have POTS. If he says yes, ask him to explain to you what POTS is, put him on the spot and get him to face the music of your condition.

If he does *not* believe you have POTS, again, put him on the spot. Ask him why not, ask him why he feels you are just being ""lazy"". If you can get him to see how emotionally distraught everything is, it might help him reconsider his viewpoints.

However, I don't know your dad, so I can't tell it that idea would even work or not, or if it would just make things worse on yourself.

spirituality,ffay40o,t3_esguvg,1579747179.0,"This is how I come to look at things. I hope this helps you.

Look at science for a moment. Have you heard of the observer effect? In science, the term observer effect means that the act of observing will influence the phenomenon being observed. In quantum mechanics, the act of observation becomes even more interesting. Look into it yourself if you're not familiar with it.

Essentially, you are both the observer, and the observed.

We are all the creators of our own reality. Whatever you put your full observation (belief) in is what is the truth. 

Are you born a sinner and need Jesus to save your soul? If that is what you observe (believe), then that is what you will experience as the observed. Your observation (belief) in Jesus can then be intensified in whatever way you seek further confirmation. Something doesn't add up? You can fall away from that and whatever you observe (believe) next is your next reality.

How can there be contradicting observations (beliefs)? How can everyone be a creator of their own reality? How can there be so many contradictory realities?

Science again is coming up with the idea of multiple dimensions and multiverses. Not sure if this is a far stretch for you, but have you heard of the Mandela Effect? If not, look into it. Basically, there are things you may find you **strongly** remember as being differently, and so do many others, yet if you look at our current reality, things are different and do not reflect what you may so strongly remember. These can be nothing more than examples that you have, indeed, entered another reality in which this is the current status of events in this dimension. Basically think of it as a deja vu event, a crack in the matrix, a break in reality, whatever term fits it most for you.

So, if you can create your own reality by observing what you want, and there are multiple realities with multiple dimensions, etc etc, then how can all of the contradictions *not* coexist, if you can choose your own adventure? You can choose what you observe. 

Look at our own world as a simple example. Different countries have different rules, laws, faiths, customs, languages, dialects, etc etc. How can they all exist when we are all still the same species? How can we have different blood types, skin and hair types, illnesses and diseases that set us apart from one another when we are all still the same exact species? How is it that us, as a species, can be so varied and have many things contradictory between us, yet the reality in which we live cannot be so varied as well, and is a harder concept to grasp?

As within, as without. As above, so below.

Going beyond the human level, we see the planet earth. In one part, the region is always cold. Another part is always warm, and may have severe weather. Another part may be hot, dry, and never any precipitation. Another part may be hot, humid, muggy with the ability for precipitation. How is it this same planet can have so many other biomes? Then, compare earth to other planets and satellites, and how they differ. Mostly water, mostly carbon, mostly gaseous, similar to Earth, super hot, super cold, etc etc.

Is it unbelievable that we are humans that are so different to each other? Is it unbelievable that this planet called earth can have so many different biomes that they contradict each other (the cold Antarctica vs the hot countries near the equator?). Is it so unbelievable that our planet Earth can be so different from other planets and satellites in our known universe? Is it, therefore, so unbelievable that we, as the observers of our own reality, may be living our own reality both separately yet jointly with others at the same time?

I am not saying I am right, all I am saying is this is how I've come to view the reality we are in. If you believe (observe) the facts of life differently, then that will be your reality, and mine will be null and void."

povertyfinance,ff9s55l,t1_ff9hx73,1579720013.0,"It's a sad state of affairs when there is consideration whether curing people is financially and economically viable. We need to change the way the health care system makes it's money and operates.

This is how Big Pharma stays around, too. We are treated for our symptoms, **not** the root causes. One of the medications my daughter is on has truly helped her get better. Just for a 15 day supply (15 tiny tablets) is a little over $300, that's $20 per pill. All to treat a symptom, not a cause.

My condition, there is no cure available. Until science can create a bionic heart, all I have available is patches to help my heart last as long as it can until the inevitable heart transplant option is all I have left. My disease left me with a defect in my heart. I was born with an underdeveloped ventricle, and a valve that never formed. The shunt in my heart that has allowed me to live a normal life is failing. My April surgery is an updated shunt operation that should give me 20ish more years before my heart has declined to the point that I am on the transplant list.

People like me were born with this condition. My mother was warned before I was born that I had heart problems. Science has a **long** way to go before they can cure people with congenital issues. There will, unfortunately, always be people with issues that can't always be prevented. Genes mutate. Defects happen. 

Instead of worrying about the economical consequences of curing people, it should be noted that there will always be sick people, diseases, accidents, and so forth. Broken bones cannot be easily prevented. People have allergies, bodies don't perform at top notch. We can't get machines to work indefinitely without repairs or upgrades needed, our fragile skeletal meat bags we call our body is no exception. We break down in time. The threat of curing people and the economical implications of it shouldn't be as big as it is. Change the way the system earns it's money, let it learn to make money by making less than it has been used to but with the knowledge that there will **always** be a need for healthcare should be enough to keep things going. We're no where near the point of curing everything. The economical threat should not dissuade us from doing what is humane. I did not do anything that brought on my condition, it was present before my birth. I should not be doomed to the limited choices I have because the cure of my disease would cause someone else to lose money."

Next thing I know I get a letter explaining how I lost my medical insurance. What? I called them up, and long story short the person in charge of my case turned *their* portion of my renewal paperwork in late, and *I* got penalized for it! I went roughly 4-6 months without insurance. My insurance renews in February, surgery date is in April. This is not a 100% dire need to do right now surgery, but I don't want to have to wait longer then I have to just to get this surgery done. Originally when the idea of surgery was brought up, it sounded like I'd need it by fall of last year. Had tests done, and surgeon and cardiologist team allowed me to wait for after the winter to do the surgery (hospital is like 3 hours away, and after the surgery I'll have to go back a few times for testing to make sure of my progress, and I didn't want to have to worry about driving through snow and ice during those first few months).

However, now that the renewal date of my insurance looms closer, I worry about having a repeat like a few years ago, having no insurance despite turning in everything on time.

POTS,ff973wf,t1_ff8kp9r,1579706391.0,"I am wondering if it's her medications, but the hallucinations and disassociations started suddenly (and separately), and both started after she'd been on her current medications for months. Did yours start while you were still adjusting, or how did your hallucinations start?

After her last disassociation, she's been put on a new medication (Abilify) which seems to be doing wonders for her emotionally. She's been suffering from depression and anxiety, and she's coming out of her shell more and even picking up her room for the first time since we've moved here last year. She says she feels better. She has mentioned the hallucinations seem more tame (not as severe), and has yet to disassociate, although that was always a random event.

Unfortunately we also suspect she has some form of high functioning autism or Asperger's. Her brother is moderately-severely autistic, and she is showing a lot of the traits (no eye contact, certain sensory things really bother her, rolls herself up in blankets when she's got too much anxiety going on, fidgets often) however she was not like this when she was little, and over the past few years this has come about. Maybe she's always had autism/Asperger's but the beginning of POTS has made it worse, or we're not sure if this may be just learned traits (she's been homeschooled most of her life, and with her brother being older she's obviously had a lot of growing up and learning years with him). My daughter doesn't really know either, but wants to be tested. However, since she's past the age of 6 no one near us will really test her for either because ""it's unnecessary"" and her insurance won't cover it.

Before they moved Autism to a spectrum base, my son was diagnosed with a specific form of Autism. With his, hallucinations and the like can happen (and he, himself, did experience hallucinations around the same age my daughter is). The specific form of autism my son has doesn't develop until later in life. He didn't develop his until he was about 3 years old. It's entirely possible she has the same form of autism, just not as severely. It would go far to explain a lot of her issues that I do not feel are POTS related. It's just unfortunate that we're having difficulties getting her diagnosed to begin with, and since autism is considered a spectrum now I doubt they'll even consider looking into the specific type our son has, or even a related one."

When I get to the part about there being a shunt in my heart, and that at age 30 I am a female suffering from heart failure, they always assume I don't know what I am talking about. ""You look great for having heart failure! Are you sure? I don't think you are suffering from it.""

I then get an xray done, they then recheck my records, and even call my cardiologist, and next time they come in they're more serious about my condition and no longer doubt what I am saying. It has happened every time I have gone to that hospital. Thankfully there is another one nearby that isn't so in the dark about my condition, but if I have an emergency, the one closest to me will doubt the medical history my husband will give them.

That being said, I don't get discouraged by their attempts at understanding my condition.

It's the same with my daughter. She has POTS, and a few other things. Somewhere she has something else going on that we've been unable to get diagnosed or pinned down (hallucinations and disassociating the primary). Have seen a whole slew of doctors and specialists trying to get her figured out, but so far no answers. We are patient, and just keep getting more second opinions until someone can shed some light onto what might be going on."

My surgeon that will be performing on me worked on me on my last surgery (when I was 4), and has performed this surgery I'll be having more than a hundred times. Asides from a doctor in NY and the Mayo he's performed this surgery the most, and only lost patients that were already on deaths door when he performed. I am not concerned about my survival rate too much, however I am sure it will probably come to a head when April comes.

It just worries me to think about how I have to stay within a certain financial bubble if I want to stay covered and never worry about out of pocket expenses (Medicaid). Like all of us, living financially sufficient is a dream, but for me I have to play things careful otherwise the expenses for my own health care can dwindle me down to nothing."

I am going to be having open heart surgery, and during the surgery I will be on life support, the whole gamut. If I didn't have Medicaid, I would have to hope whatever insurance I had would cover. It's not my fault I was born with this disease. I know doctors, surgeons, etc need paid, but to the point that the person needing the treatment can go into debt and become homeless is ridiculous. I am only 30, and the prices of medical care here is so outrageous. It makes me concerned about how things may be for my future. If I lose Medicaid, and my insurance doesn't cover everything, can I afford to stay alive? Unless medical science advances come in time, a transplant is in my future.

EstrangedAdultChild,ff7szi4,t3_es10fs,1579657622.0,"Going estranged was somewhat similar for me.

The month I turned 18 I moved in with my boyfriend (now husband) with the intent of going NC with my mother (father died when I was little). I come from a middle class family, was moving in with a guy who comes from a poor family. He's older than me, and lived with *his* mother (who accepted our relationship), so between them finances were taken care of. I still had my senior year or high school to attend, then worry about college.

As you can imagine, I got the works when I got the calls. I left while my my mother was at work, and piled my shit into my car. Left a note (though wasn't rocket science for her to figure out where I went).

Instead of my mother calling, my brother called (he's a half brother, share the same mom), yelling at me for throwing my life away. I moved in with a poor guy, so obviously that meant I'd be hungry and sick all the time. I moved in with a guy that was a few years older than me, which meant he only wanted me for only one thing and in a few years he'd ditch me for a younger woman (yes, my brother yelled all this to me). Eventually, my brother demanded that we meet him at an **abandoned parking lot on a 100+°F day**... Yeaaah.

After that I ignored all phone calls. A few days later my mother called, leaving a voicemail explaining how she was wanting to meet at a corner where I now lived, and was already there. I didn't meet her. She called me back and said she was cutting me off of her insurances (car, health, etc) and would only reconsider if I came back home.

My recommendation is to ignore his phone calls. Yelling and belittling you is disrespectful, why show him respect when he fails to return the favor?

This is a hard situation, but you need to decide now if you want to maintain limited contact, or no contact at all. Depending on which you choose, you need to set up boundaries and stick to them. If you don't wish to talk to your stepdad, then don't. Block his number. Better yet, get a new number so you don't have to be worried about surprise phone calls. Don't tell them your new address (or you risk surprise visits).

Starting the day I left, I never once answered the phone/email/etc of my mother. My intent was to go NC with her, and that's what I did. 

It has been 12 years since I left and went NC. I am also NC with the rest of my family. Could not be any happier.

The last hold your stepdad has on you is insurance and a phone bill. Are either of these in your name? If not, move on and don't worry about it. Legally he can't hold you to them.  

What kind of insurance is the issue? If it's health, it's perfectly legal for you to get your own health insurance (many people have secondary health insurance), just when you go to other places say that whatever new health insurance you choose is your new primary insurance. 

I wish you the best of luck! Hang in there, it's going to be rough."

She has dementia and/or Alzheimer's not sure what exactly (refuses to see a doctor, but her own mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's before passing and my MIL shows similar symptoms). With her mental decline, she gaslights both of us, and for me #4 especially.

> 4. It was just a joke. You have no sense of humor.

Last week she came up to me while I was in the bedroom and said ""Yea, I hear you back here talking, you talk so loud."" I'm actually a really quiet person, so naturally I asked, ""What do you mean?""

She responded with, ""I hear you back here complaining about how awful the world is, just complaining, complaining, complaining."" Well, she can't hear for shit, needs hearing aids, but also does hallucinate (once thought the neighbors were plotting to kill her), so for all I know she's delusional and really believes this.

I ask, ""When did I say any of this?"" She replied, ""Oh, all the time, you talk so loud when you say it!"" Then my husband (her son) comes in, obviously having overheard everything. He asks her what the hell she is going on about, and what did my MIL reply with?

**""It was just a joke, she** (meaning me) **always takes everything so seriously! Can't I make a joke? Is that alright? It's not my fault if she can't take a joke! She's too serious all the time.""**

I then had to take our kids out, as my husband tried to get her to calm down. Dementia/Alzheimer's is a horrible disease, it can really make them unbearable. 

Growing up, my mother may not have ever said #6, but that was the serious overtones I grew up with.

> 6. You’re the problem here, not me.

I was blamed for both my father and sister dying (dad died when I was 5 months old, sister died when I was about 4 years old and we lived in completely different states). Somehow I caused their deaths, or so my mother would tell me. Growing up, if my mother ever had a bad day, I somehow caused it.

We even tried family counseling once. Therapist gave me a few items to work on, and gave my mother basically a laundry list of things she needed to do to help mend our relationship. As we left, my mother said, ""Well, she is full of it. That's ok, we'll never do this again. Where should we go eat for dinner?""

When told my mother my cousin molested me, she went around and told others that I was making up stories for attention.

I ask cause sure, lots of games nowadays do have beautiful scores due to the ability to include such dynamic music. However, older games with more limitations on the sounds it could produce tended to have memorable soundtracks. Many of the scores from Mario and even Zelda comes to mind. Sure, these games are also cult classics, but it doesn't mean we have to fall in love with the music too.

Since you are a composer for a game company, have you heard of the group Pornophonique? They use the 8-bit sounds from Commodore 64 to make the music in their songs. They have songs called Space Invaders and Sad Robot that I love a lot. You can find them on YouTube. You will probably get a kick out of them.

EstrangedAdultChild,fezg1gx,t1_feypsv6,1579456941.0,"My best advice is don't say anything about moving quite yet, at the very least. You are still debating about the idea of moving, so unless you want to stir up trouble, wait to say anything until you have at *least* made up your mind. Since you'll be moving farther from where you currently reside, it will take quite a bit of time to get it ready. Finding a home, new job, etc. Don't jump the gun by mentioning you're moving until more of your ducks are in a row. Otherwise you risk your mother or brother taking things the wrong way, and so recently after all this has spurred, will only be looked upon in a negative light.

Plus, as you wait and get things figured out on whether or not you will move, and where you will go, etc, this will give you time to gage both of them and figure out how they might react. None of us know your mother or brother as well as you do, and unfortunately that means you'll have to make the best judgement you can on what to do. Don't rush things, you don't need to make a decision now, don't need to say anything quite yet when you're still debating on what to do. Take the time to reflect on yourself, your mother, your brother, and your past. Having only come to this realization about your mother is hard enough on you, don't rush into adding more chaos into the mix quite yet.

Relax and take a breather. Take time before doing or saying anything. Figure out what you are going to do, and in the meantime study their actions. Since you're newly to being limited to no contact, see how their reaction is to this sudden move of yours will be. Focus on yourself and your family beyond them and figure things out. No need to rush, but take caution. This is a new reality for you, one that most of us here have lived for a long time, and still struggle with. Know that you are among friends here. Know that we understand your situation. Take things slow. If you're not adverse to the idea, maybe even seek a therapist to help you deal with the sudden dilemma you've found yourself in so that you can better process things. Otherwise, use your husband as support and know that this community exists. Take things slow, don't rush into telling them anything, and take care of yourself. I wish you only the best."

EstrangedAdultChild,feyoi7p,t3_eqig3q,1579448304.0,"I am so sorry for your recent revelations about your mother. It's a hard situation to go through, all of us here can agree.

Before I say much, I have a question of concern for you. 

Your brother, how violent can he get? Is there any potential that your brother in a drunken rage or drugged up moment could become violent?

I ask because the day I went NC and moved out of my mothers house, my brother had called me (mother knew where I was going, wasn't rocket science). I was staying with my bf (now husband) at his place. My brother called, demanding to meet at an abandoned parking lot to ""talk things out"" on a 100+°F day. When I suggested a restaurant instead, he said ""this is not the type of conversation to have at a restaurant"".

This was the first I had ever experienced the violent side of my brother. I am thankful my BF had recently moved, otherwise I would have feared my brother showing up and trying to beat the shit out of my BF. On the phone I could hear his anger. He didn't even want me to explain my actions to him, he just kept saying ""meet me at this abandoned parking lot"".

So, that being said, considering everything going on, I think something you need to consider (which I've seen no one else mention) is your brother.

Your mother has already shown him the private text messages you sent her, and is spinning things explaining you don't believe he can heal. Add to the fact that he's doing drugs, alcohol, driving, doing acts illegally with the OK of your enabling mother..... You need to consider what actions he might take if you explain you are leaving. He's already breaking the law, what else is he capable of doing (and encouraged to by your mother)?

I am not necessarily meaning physical harm, but you need to realize he may do other things. Begin stalking, maybe damaging personal property, steal your vehicle, set your current home on fire, who knows? You need to really sit and think about the condition your brother is in.

He's in a bad place right now. Breaking the law, and filling his mind and body with substances that already makes it difficult to think straight. With your mother covering for him, showing him when people talk negatively about him and encouraging his behaviors, you **really** need to consider the danger he might possibly be.

So, my long winded warning is, say you tell your mother you are moving. If she doesn't accept it, demands you stay, etc etc what is going to stop your mother from asking your brother to doing whatever he can to change your mind, OR your brother just ""protecting"" his mother by seeking revenge on you for hurting her (that's the path my brother personally took).

This situation can be very dangerous, considering the circumstances. Your mother already enables your brother to break the law. Your mother already has made you look like a bad guy to your brother. With drugs and alcohol in his brain, and already a feeling of invincibility by continuing to break the law and encouraged so by your mother, you need to really sit and consider what your brother may truly be capable of doing.

My best suggestion for you, if you want to continue low contact with your mother, is to tell her *after* you have moved. I would even hesitate telling her where (don't give home address). I know you said this doesn't feel like a texting situation, so call instead.

If you don't want to continue contact with her, then don't tell her anything. Move, and slip away.

Basically, she's already shown you disrespect, as well  as  the fact 
that she's a  poor judge of character. Showing off your private texts to her to your brother, the person the conversation was about. Twisting your words to mean nothing of what you've said. Enabling your brother to break the law (and at what gain for herself other than to have one child committed to being indebt to her and doing what she asks?). This doesn't sound like a respectful person, so why show respect back by giving the courtesy note that you will be leaving? Would it not drive more of a nail to your argument if you tell your mother ""You are twisting my words and have broken my trust, I have already moved and don't plan on giving you my address. If you want me in your life, I need to see that you understand how you've hurt me and that what you are doing is wrong."" Otherwise, if you tell her you're going to move while still in your old place, what's to stop her / your brother from coming up to your door to start trouble, or worse scenarios?

Again, the fact that your mother is enabling your brother to break the law is what is giving me the biggest pause about the idea of telling them you're going to move before you move. My brother was sincere about wanting to beat up the man I was with. Why? Cause my BF was the reason his baby sister had left their mother and was going NC, or at least in his mind. Did you not say you're moving closer to your husband's family? Do you want to risk your brother trying to ""talk"" to your husband about taking his sister away from your mother, much like my brother tried?

This is a difficult situation no matter how you look at it. I wish you the best of luck with all if this. It won't be easy, and having just come to the realization of your mother's personality is only going to make an already difficult situation that much worse. I am sorry you are going through this, I hope you find a solution that works for you, and that no harm comes to you."
cookingforbeginners,fewejtb,t3_eqjpvd,1579409278.0,"My breakfast is never your classical ""breakfast"" food. 

I never really cared for the classic breakfast foods. Sure, I'd eat cereal, pancakes and waffles, maybe french toast on occasion. However, I am not a fan of sweets, and eating something so sugary sweet first thing in the morning upsets my stomach. Oatmeal falls into this category, cause I only like it sweet, not bland or savory. Now, I am more than happy to eat these later (waffles for dinner is something we occasionally do), because my stomach isn't so empty and the sweet doesn't bother it.

I love sunny side up eggs, and bacon, but I have heart problems so I watch the grease and fat. I do **not** care for omelettes or scrambled eggs.

So, my typical breakfast meal usually consists of one of a few options. First, leftovers. I like leftovers, no one else in my household really does. Easiest thing to prep, just reheat and eat.

Second option, I make myself soup or ramen. If I use ramen, it's just the noodles and I season it myself.

Third, I make myself something more time consuming. Maybe I do eggs (maybe bacon too). Maybe take a piece of chicken and fry myself some chicken. Maybe I just eat a simple salad.

Point is, breakfast for me is not limited to ""breakfast"" foods. I do not usually care for them, especially on an empty stomach. Breakfast for me is just a timeframe to eat, not a strictly specific food type of meal you have."

EstrangedAdultChild,fess6vi,t1_feolr2z,1579368469.0,"May I ask, has your mother actually made the attempt? If so, what happened?

You have before you two decisions. Neither of which will bring you happiness in the end.

You can please your mother (and your family) by staying close to home and not cutting her (or the family) off. In doing so, you sacrifice your happiness, your chance to travel, your freedom, and your self. Instead, you are agreeing to be controlled by the whims of your mother. Trading your life for hers. You die, so that she may live. And what is her thanks for it? Nothing. Just more guilt upon your shoulders for the fact that she claims you are the only reason she is alive. What mother does this to their own child?

Or, you can be free, and take the job and go. You will do it, spreading your wings to freedoms you've never experienced before. In return, your mother *might* kill herself. In return, you *might* lose your family.

Let me ask you, what has your family done to try to change your mothers mind? I assume they are aware of her suicidal thoughts. Have they ever attempted any sort of intervention?

And again, has your mother actually attempted? Having a note and actually attempting are two very different things. Depending on the mental instabilities your mother has, this could still be a huge lie of hers just to keep you close. 

Let me ask another question. You mentioned that you haven't lived at home for 3 years. How did your mother take you leaving home? With how she sounds, how come she did not threaten suicide when you planned to leave home? How is it she was willing to see you leave home without it effecting her, yet moving a state away for a job is where she crosses the line?

You admit your family is toxic. You admit your mother is toxic. I know this will sound heartless, but, if they are toxic people and have abused you in the past, *why deal with them?*

My husband has a saying. You can't help the family you are born into, but you can create the family you want to be in, and blood has nothing to do with it.

Neither your mother nor your family are willing to let you grow up, be an adult, and make your own decisions for yourself. They would rather make threats to keep you near, and are ready to blame you for things beyond your control.

If your mother is as suicidal as she appears to be, you could have even a simple argument with her and she'd make a decision that she'd had enough and end it then and there. You really have no surefire way to know that staying behind and abiding by her will be enough to keep her afloat.

And, if she does ever go through with it, you **need** to understand that her death is not your fault. If your family knows she is suicidal, but are doing **nothing** to try and help/stop her, and then turn around to blame you for her death is about as low as it can get. If they won't help your mother, it shows they do not care about her. If they will not help you find a solution to where you can be happy and ensure your mothers safety, it proves they do not care about you nor your mother.

That being said, why deal with people who do not care about you? Because they are your family? So what! You said so yourself, they are toxic people. If they are toxic, do not care about you, and would rather blame you then be of any help, what kind of family is that? 

I know, trust me I do. The thought of ostracizing yourself completely from everyone you came from is hard. I have been estranged from my **entire** family for 12 years now. There is not a single person from my family I talk to. Trust me, I know how hard it is. I know the struggles, heartache, and courage it takes.

I am now married. I have a husband. I have kids. I have my own family now. A better family than I had before. I do not miss my old family. I have a great life now.

You could have that too, but you have to step away. You can't fly if you don't take a leap.

Again, take the job, leave, and call the cops for wellness checks. Do you have a copy of her reasons to commit suicide and reasons to not letter? Get ahold of authorities, show it to them to help prove that she is a danger to herself. You are her child, not her mother, you are **not** responsible for her actions. You do not live with her, you are not her mother, you are not her legal guardian, you do not have power of attorney over her, you do not have any of that. She has the ability to seek help but doesn't. Is that your fault? **No**. Your family has the ability to intervene and help her get the care that she needs. Is it your fault they don't care, are lazy, and would rather blame you instead? **No**. Is it your fault that your mother is suicidal? **No**. Is it your fault if she does go through with it? **No**. Your family could help stop things now, but don't. If they want to blame anyone, they can blame themselves for neglect. They cannot possibly expect a child to be the sole person responsible in charge of ensuring your mothers survival.

Call the cops (not the emergency number) and ask what to do. Ask the suicide hotline prevention what to do. Ask them, and leave it be. Walk away from the situation. Trust that your local authorities will handle the situation.

I am so sorry for what you are going through. I hope you find your way out of this, and I hope you find happiness."

And, because we've not been able to get her diagnosed with anything to prove she's mentally incapable of making decisions,  we can't just force her to go get checked. 
She can still deny services if we tried. So, here we are.

In a way, he does honestly realize the situation at hand. However, he's had such a long positive relationship with her that he has a hard time separating the fact that mentally she's no longer the mother he once knew. She has good days and bad days, and sometimes those good days helps reinforce within himself that she's still there. When the bad days come, he goes into ""little boy scolded by his mother"" mode and has a hard time coming to terms with the fact that most of the time she attacks him, it's because mentally she's unstable and is lashing because she can't mentally comprehend another way of speaking with us about whatever is ailing her, assuming she even knows what *is* ailing her.

Because we *do* have kids is what makes it the hardest. Our youngest is being effected by it all more than I think my husband has come to terms with, despite my telling him.

However, I love my husband dearly. I will put up with his mentally broken mother until she becomes physical (has not yet thankfully), or if she starts wandering. Then I will put my foot down and give him ultimatums. Until then, I put up with it. I love him more than I can say, and he himself has never intentionally hurt me in any way. I will be here for him, waiting, for whenever he is ready to face the facts and figure out what we need to do for the happiness and wellness of the family.

Wow, sorry I wrote a lot. I get wordy and, as you can figure, this is a difficult situation for me. Because I know what it's like to see your loved one willingly put up with abuse from their parents in hope of the past good times coming back, or finding a way to fix things, is why I initially replied to you. I am on the other side of the fence. My husbands actions effect our family. I wanted to make you remembered that fact for yourself, for when the temptation is there."
crochet,fen3dus,t3_eptg4f,1579276080.0,"So cute and adorable!

Funnily enough I learned to (knit not crochet) because of my daughter. She was about 8 and wanted to learn. I didn't know how, so we got for her for Xmas a dvd beginners to knitting gift set that was geared for beginners as young as a preschooler. Sure enough, one of the first beginner tutorials was taught by a little boy that was maybe a preschooler or in kindergarten himself.

My daughter had difficulty understanding it, so I watched the dvd to try to learn. Maybe it was us, maybe it was the dvd but I was confused at the very same part she was. So, I went to the internet to learn. Got it down pat, made swatches and was confident I could teach her. Then I sat down and attempted to teach her. Long story short, she didn't care for it, though she did make a few things.

I eventually attempted crocheting just to see the differences. Have yet to look back haha. Daughter has no interest in crocheting either."
EstrangedAdultChild,fen1pgw,t3_eq01nm,1579275006.0,"Not everyone from abusive households have nothing but bad feelings and memories. There's usually good memories mixed in, which causes the struggle to become estranged that much harder. We remember the good times, and desire to bring it back, and fix things in whatever way we can.

However, we sometimes have a hard time facing the fact that no matter how hard we desire the past, and those good times, it may be gone forever.

My MIL lives with us, and is suffering from dementia and/or Alzheimer's. Won't get checked so not definitive on a diagnosis, however her own mother **was** diagnosed with Alzheimer's around my MIL's same age when she started showing symptoms.

Right now, my MIL is at a stage where I look upon her as a broken child. She fights, she whines, she hallucinates and misremembers everything. She is causing our household untold stress and anxiety, abusing us as she lashes out in fear and anger.

My husband assures me that she has not always been this way. He remembers her as a woman that would give the clothes off her own back to someone in need, someone who'd feed a stranger or listen to them tell their story. This is not the woman I know, but because this is the good memories he remembers, he does what he can to make her happy and comfortable living with us despite the fact that she is no longer the woman he once called his mother. Instead of admitting she has changed and will never be the woman my husband remembers her to be, he deludes himself and ignores the fact that she has hurt him and his family in the worst ways imaginable.

I say this all, because you sound sure of the outcomes of reaching out would cause. You mentioned you have a family now, does that include kids? Do you want the unfortunate attitudes and behaviors of your parents to effect your husband (and kids if you have them?). Do you want to risk putting your kids in a similar situation as you were growing up, just as grandparents not parents? Do you want to risk the harm they can do to your family?

Even if you are the only one that interacts with your parents, do you want to put your husband through an emotional rollercoaster as he watches you put yourself in a situation that you **know** will have a negative outcome, all because of a dream and a desire to fix them? What about your kids? Do you want them to see you are sad, depressed, and suffering?

Are you in therapy? If not, I suggest you start. You have a lot on your plate right now, and you need someone who can help you work through it all.

If you *do* decide to reach out to them, please think of your family, and how your actions effect them too. They love you. It would hurt them to see you putting yourself in a situation that you **know** will only end in pain. 

I wish you the best of luck. It's not easy being estranged, I know. I have been estranged for 12 years now, have a family of my own, and now a MIL that does nothing but bring up past traumas of mine. Life isn't easy, but hold onto the good that is in your life. You have a family. Use their love and support to help you get past this troubling time."

EstrangedAdultChild,fejrz74,t3_epg3n9,1579184385.0,"I am so sorry for your losses and your current situation.

I understand your desire to find someone older to talk to. You are seeking that parental (and maybe even elderly) wisdom and advice, nurturing and caring. Something to fill the unfortunate gap that is in your life.

Please, don't be selective about age. Older is not always wiser, more understanding, caring, and better. My MIL was the first person I ever met that woke me up to the idea that my elders are not always wise. No, this isn't just your standard DIL-MIL feuds. She is beyond disrespectful towards everyone she meets, and then turns around and wonders why no one talks to her. She has a hard time understanding how she has dug herself a hole, and no one wants to speak with her. Even my daughter has cried and begged for a ""normal"" grandmother.

Look at the family you came from. How many of them are older, yet turn you away despite what all you've come through?

What I am trying to say, is please don't be limited to one age group. Realize that perhaps the person who may be of most benefit to you may be your same age, or younger. Eventually, you will reach an age where finding someone older to talk to about worries and life will be hard to find. When you reach that age, what will you do then when you desire the same?

There's no reason why you cannot find someone, of any age, to help you out. Age is just a number, does not truly have any value other then a signifier of how many years you've been alive. Being 70 does not mean you are wise and a shining example of a human being. Being 20 doesn't mean you can't be mature, and have never experienced trauma and hardships. This is a sub where people have been harmed by their own families to such a degree we'd rather go LC or NC than face their abuse. Do you think we are all 30+ here? I am sure we all are not. That being said, do you feel we are unqualified to fill this hole you seek? Is age what matters the most to you, or finding someone to help you out in this time of need, even if they are younger?

If you **really** desire the older age, there are things you can do. Volunteer at a local hospice or nursing home, or even a hospital. Put yourself in situations that will enable you to be around those that you seek. I suggested the hospice or nursing home mainly because I guarantee you will find people there more than glad to talk to you. Get close enough to them, and they can probably help to fill that void you seek. If you're religious and attend church, why not bring this up to someone there and see if they have a solution for you? Are you in therapy? If so, your therapist may even have some ideas for you.

Again, I am so sorry to hear about how your family is treating you. I truly do hope you can find what you seek."
EstrangedAdultChild,feisb3j,t1_fei2v8f,1579145935.0,"The last statement you made is a good way to test the waters. Take some time to really think things over, talk to your therapist, and make a game plan for going forward and how to pull back if need be. If he becomes restless and turns while you sort things out, that would give you a sign of how far along he truly is.

However, do not be surprised if he does attempt to reach out again, especially depending on the length of time you make him wait. If he is honestly 100% is remorseful for his actions, he's probably going to be in a stew of his own emotions until you reply. If he is 100% truly a changed man, he's going to have a hard time resting until he hears from you. He poured his heart out to you, is raw, numb, admitting his sins and is probably disheveled and a mess. Since he wrote you the letter (snail mail wise) he may even begin to doubt you even received his letter to begin with. So, if he is sincere, please don't take offense if he sends you another message asking for a reply.

However, I still feel you should wait things out. Wait for him to possibly send another letter, or whenever you feel is appropriate to reach out to him. He may, alternatively, not even attempt to reach out again, even if he is sincere. Since he did not ask for forgiveness, he may even chalk up your silence as a sign that he has said what he can, and knows he's done too much damage to change things.

Either way, what I am trying to say is I feel your decision to hold out a while is sounds advice. Give your dad a chance to possibly trip himself up in case this is a large charade (which I highly doubt), and it gives you some time to process things. Do not be surprised if he attempts to contact you again and ask for an answer. If you make him wait a really long time, I would even dare to say don't be surprised if he contacts you and is slightly upset. If he is 100% sincere, this is a huge deal. He is coming to the facts of what he's done. I don't know your dad, so I can't say for certain what to expect from him. But, if he is the real deal, then if you make him wait too long to reply it might make him slightly manic and demanding for an answer. He poured his heart out, he's raw and waiting for your reply. So, if you wait too long, don't be surprised if he seems a little pushy or demanding of an answer. 

However, I still feel the waiting game is a good choice. I hope I make sense with everything. This is going to be a rough situation either way. Take things slow. 

I do have a question for you, though. Did he also abuse your brother, or were you the brunt of his ire? If he did abuse your brother, has *he* also heard from your dad? I would be curious to know if he has reached out to both of you, or just you. How does your brother perceive the situation?

Best of luck to you!"
EstrangedAdultChild,fehzb9h,t3_ep793g,1579126914.0,"This is potentially a wonderful miracle to occur for you. I have never received an apology letter or anything similar, so I can't speak from personal experience with what to do from here.

If you wish to explore it, take it slow. Let him know that you need to pace things. If things go well, and if you feel it is needed, perhaps family therapy can be an outlet for you two to explore as you figure out what to do.

I can understand how it's hard to believe it. Perhaps, if you do choose to begin contacting him again, ask him what changed. Or, if you know anyone that does talk to him (asides from your mother) that may be able to shed some light, ask them. Perhaps he is on, and sticking to, a new medication change. Perhaps he even started therapy himself. Maybe he had a brush with death, and it has woken him up to realize the life he's led. Maybe he's even had a taste of his own medicine, and is realizing the degree of his actions.

Considering he typed out a 3 page confession to you, it doesn't sound like this is some bizarre ploy of his to get you to notice him only to turn around and hurt you. This is an insane amount of work and admitting his faults to turn around and get you while you're vulnerable to his lies, especially since it sounds like this is not his normal methods.

Take things slow. Have a plan laid out on how to revert back to NC if need be. Ask the questions you need to ask. Are you sincere? What's changed? What made you realize the horrors you've put us through? Perhaps your mother really did speak to him at a time that he was finally ready to come to terms with everything. Also, ask him what he wants at this point.

He may be appalled at his own behavior to continue contact. He did not ask for your forgiveness, but admitted his wrongdoings. He may feel he is unworthy of both your forgiveness and a part in your life. It may be, ultimately, up to you if your relationship should grow or not.

I just urge you to go slow. Don't rush too fast, and be prepared for pain. However, this might be a golden opportunity to fix a broken relationship. 

Do note, if you do **not** wish to mend things and speak with him, then do not feel pressured to. He abused you, you are the one that suffered because of his actions. He may repent about his past mistakes now, but it doesn't change what happened in the past. If you are not ready for this opportunity, or don't want to even attempt things, then that is your right.

Never tried this sugar cookie recipe before (was first time baking cookies all by myself) but could not imagine there was an error with the recipe.

Well, eventually had it pointed out that I made the cookies with *baking powder* instead of *flour*. I had never seen anyone have such a huge container of baking powder before!

How do you know 100% she will kill herself? People can be **very** overdramatic when they want to control someone. If you somehow honestly know she would go through with it, then find whatever way you can to get her help. You are **not** responsible for her actions. My father died from suicide when I was only 5 months old, and my mother constantly blamed me for his death. I did not fall for her mind games. Do not fall for your mother's.

Why do you risk losing your family if you cut her off? Do they not know how she treats you? If they deny what you say or side with her irregardless, you need to **really** sit back and think about this family relationship. I know this may be harsh, and I am so sorry for that. But it is **not** right for a parent to treat their child the way yours does. My mother tried so hard to do the same. Up to and including telling me what to wear when I was 17! (She didn't like that I preferred jeans and a t-shirt and instead wanted me to dress up in dresses and skirts and be ""pretty""). If your family feels it is completely acceptable behavior for your mother to talk, threaten, and treat you the way that she does, they are not a family you should deal with. I am sorry.

>!You need to leave, and I am sure even you can agree. But afraid to, and why? Worst case scenario, she kills herself. This is harsh, I am sorry, but do you **honestly** feel she would go through with it? If so, she kills herself. Then what? Would you still be ostracized from your family, or would this wake them to realizing her instabilities to help the whole family heal and move on? I highly doubt she would kill herself, but I do not know the level of mental health issues she suffers from nor her personality. If you **honestly** feel she would be a danger to herself, tip off authorities yourself. Take your job and move away and constantly call the cops for wellness checks. It is unfair to you to feel you have to stay chained to her because **she** cannot handle the idea of life without you, and is (claiming) to go to such extremes. If you don't go to the job, what's going to stop her from demanding you live with her again, or else she kills herself? What if she demands you quit working and stay home to care for her night and day or else she'll kill herself? How far are you going to let her push you? Somewhere you have to either test her claims and disobey or risk not having a life of your own. Worst case scenario, either she dies physically, or you die emotionally and mentally. That's *if* she even will go through with it.!<

There are many ways to get away. You can do it suddenly, or gradually. Take the job and move while staying in full contact. Your family can't possibly be upset with you for doing those things. Then, as time goes on, slowly slip away. Call less often. ""Sorry, can't talk, at work late! Sorry, can't visit, vehicle unreliable to make the long trip!""

The end result is up to you.

Are you in therapy of any kind? If so, discuss everything with them.

Ok, one last thing. If, for whatever reason she *does* kill herself, do **NOT** hold yourself accountable. You did **NOT** use the instrument that she used to end her own life. If she goes by gunshot, you would not be the one holding the gun to her head, **she** would be. **She** chose to make that decision. **She** is capable of not pulling the trigger, not you. I am no more accountable for my father's suicide when I was an infant than you would be if she chose to go through her actions. If she does, that shows the depths of the mental instabilities that she held.

And, I hate to put this out there, but you need to consider it too. >!If you **honestly** feel she would kill herself, then what is stopping her from killing you if you defy her? If you **know** she will kill herself, then how positive are you that she won't one day snap and reverse her decision and have you the target instead?!<

So, this all comes down this. If you are **positive** she is capable of causing physical death, then she needs serious help and you need to get away ASAP without feeling guilty of whatever consequences that may happen, while also contacting the correct authorities to give her the much needed care she needs. Otherwise, you need to realize she is giving you a **horrible** lie just to make you feel you cannot disobey her demands.

EstrangedAdultChild,fefl3vu,t3_eorfwa,1579058630.0,"When I was in the 6th grade I made plans to run away. I had a friend whose sister had run away, but occasionally snuck to see her sister (my friend) cause they were very close. My friend knew my situation, and asked if her sister would help me run away, which she agreed to. Had begun to make plans (made serious lists of what I would bring and never see again) until I met the man that is now my husband. He helped me to avoid living on the streets and probably surviving by prostituting myself by giving me a better view on life, and helping me in more ways than I can say. He enlightened me on the fact that I could legally emancipate myself when I turned 16, and that gave me hope. I never did it, but that knowledge gave me strength to not ruin my life and hold out a little longer. Plus he has been the one to help me through my toughest times, and really helped to turn me around. 

I remember being suicidal when I was roughly 9. Contemplated on stabbing myself repeatedly, or attempting to overdose on medicine. I was more afraid of the idea of pain than the thought of death, so asides from *'tempting fate by taking 2 baby aspirin'* (lol how innocent yet daring I thought I was) I never did anything, and eventually overcame those thoughts (since I was too scared to act upon it) until I was 12 (6th grade). Not only was I planning to run away, but if my plan did not work I was planning on killing myself as an alternative. At that time I had even begun cutting.

I knew years before I turned 18 that I was going to leave when I turned 18 and live with the man that is now my husband. Starting a year or so ahead of time I began very slowly getting my things to him. Not a lot and nothing very serious (just in case we did NOT work out), but things like extra pairs of clothes I didn't really need, books I had enjoyed but wouldn't miss too much if I never got them back but would also enjoy reading again, etc etc. Then, the months before my 18th birthday, I started really sneaking over more things. Little things (not so much clothes) so my mom wouldn't be alerted.

I don't have many more stories of how I attempted to break away prior  to going NC sinced I *did* leave home and immediately go NC the same month I turned 18. However, emotionally and mentally I was gone at a **much** younger age (as I am sure a lot of us could agree to). Secretly for **years** I referred to my mother by her name instead of ""mom"" or similar titles when I wasn't in her or my family's presence. I did not feel she deserved the title, and felt better calling her anything but the false title whenever I could. The day I left, I left after she went to work. I left her a note, and only referred to her as her name and not the false title, and that was both the scariest yet relieving moment of my life."
POTS,fefc8dk,t1_feeekde,1579053158.0,"I know all cases are different, but I see that taking too much propanolol can actually be counter-productive. Small doses can help POTS, but too much can make it worse. Again, everyone is different, but since you've been on it has your symptoms escalated?

If any of these symptoms started **after** taking propanolol, then it is entirely plausible that the med could be the cause for some of your issues. Unfortunately, it could also be your POTS (or another undiagnosed issue) causing the decline as well. 

Being told your hallucinations are nothing more than you having an active imagination is horrible! I hope this same doctor isn't the one to say that, because if so you **really** need to find a new one. My 15 year old has auditory and visual hallucinations, and even disassociates. I would never think to chalk it up as an active imagination!

So your doctor has no back up plan, only wants you to focus on recovering and not worry if you don't. I mean, in a perfect world this is sound advice. However, in a world where health issues can morph, migrate, and medicines being non-effective, adverse side effects and possibly counter-productive I would think the doctor would discuss a possible fall back plan. Husband saw the doctor today for an issue, and he has a new medicine to try. If it doesn't work and we don't see improvements in a month he wants to see my husband again to discuss further options. Don't know why your doctor can't do even *that*. Which is, again, why I am confused about why she feels March will be the month you miraculously get better.

Don't want to become reliant on a dialysis machine, so became determined to drink more.

Originally I started on an app/website called Habitica. It worked well, but it flustered me that I had to always use my phone. At the time I did it, I hardly ever used my phone and had little time to load an app and log things. Someone I met on there suggested bullet journaling. It wasn't a new concept, but I had never known what to use it for myself. I asked her questions about hers, did lots of research, looking at blogs and youtube videos before I decided to start one. Went to my local Michael's and got their cheap artloft bullet journal, and began my adventures. Granted, even from the get go I used it for more than tracking what I drank, but it was **the** reason.

Sorry, was probably more info than you really wanted but there you go. On my 3rd year, love it, and now use it for so many things."
POTS,fec9mpz,t1_febvht3,1578969116.0,"Wow.... I feel you need a different doctor, but that's up to you. For your doctor to dismiss trying to get diagnosed with EDS because there is no cure is the **stupidest** thing I have ever heard. 

As a doctor, is she not aware that there are so many conditions out there that have no cure, but doctors treat the symptoms of the underlying diseases as best they can? If there were a cure for everything, then how is it people are reliant on drugs day after day, month after month, some even going into debt just to get medicine to help them either survive or tolerate their symptoms? 

And even a simple diagnosis of one thing can lead to completely other complications due to the first diagnosis. For example, I was born with a rare congenital heart defect. There is no cure, only things can be done to hope to prolong my life. I am at risk of every heart issue imaginable and have been since birth. Yet, this strange defect also happens to cause liver disease later on in life. Since there is no cure for my condition, by your doctors logic it's pointless to get diagnosed with anything, when in actuality finding a diagnosis also helps me to be aware of other complications that tend to arrive later in life with others with my same condition despite the fact the heart causing liver issues seems to be an odd combo.

Sorry, rant over. I get it that perhaps getting a diagnosis for EDS may be difficult where you live, but for her to add that getting the diagnosis is pointless because there is no cure sends red flags to me. There's no cure for cancer, lupus, autism, dementia, etc etc yet getting a diagnosis is a pretty big deal. Just because EDS may not increase your chances of early death (neither does autism) doesn't mean it should be dismissed.

I wish you the best and truly hope you get the answers and help you need."
EstrangedAdultChild,fec6y2l,t3_eo8x4k,1578967701.0,"Welcome! I have been NC for 12 years. My husband has been NC with 98% of his family for even longer. I ran across this sub a few months ago and never knew something like this ever existed. I am glad this exists. It is truly a great place for those of us who struggle with such a harsh burden. LC? NC? Social ramifications? It's difficult when all you want to do is heal and disconnect yourself from your trauma.

Welcome. I hope this sub helps you. This is truly a great sub!"
EstrangedAdultChild,fec4kst,t1_fea7akd,1578966559.0,"Unfortunately, there's not going to be a concrete answer to your question. No two similar situations will be 100% the same, and the varying variables will change what is a valid and realistic restitution.

Let me ask you, what would you want to have happen? What is the ultimate scenario that would make you feel like restitution has been made, and you will then be willing to continue on?

Your father sounds like he is the type to mentally evaluate a situation but not emotionally invest in it. Not sure his age or background, but unfortunately men used to be raised with the stigma of never showing emotions, otherwise that means you're weak and less than a man (my husband was born in that environment but never followed). Was your father raised in a military family? Did he, himself, take part in the military, law enforcement, or even politics? All of these positions would also help reinforce that behavior. In other words, he may have learned to disconnect from his emotions. Or, the alternative is he is cold and emotionless. Either way, it sounds like he will not cry (especially since he didn't cry over either of his parents funerals, was he close to them at all or was he pretty detached and LC with them?). So, if you are hoping to see him cry and beg for forgiveness, it sounds like it's never going to happen and would be an unrealistic expectation of him.

Your mother. If I am understanding you correctly, your mother has done harm to you but has also processed her guilt with you, only to repeat it again, am I right? I apologise if I am misunderstanding things. If so, sounds like she may be bipolar, or have some other mental health issues. Possibly even dealing with her own PTSD's which only cycle around. Does harm to you, regrets, then repeats. If she didn't drink or do drugs, I would say she has her own underlying issues going on. That being said, you mentioned that she did say she wished to be forgiven, though not directly to you. If she did not cry, but seemed shaken up by the whole situation, and has a history of crying and being overly emotional, then it is possible she has grieved in recently. This might be in between the cycle she has displayed to you in the past; done harm, shown grief, then repeats. She may have recently had an outburst of guilt, and cried excessively, and is now in the ""numb"" stage afterwards. If you feel she was sincere about asking for forgiveness (even though it wasn't directed at you), she may honestly be trying to find help. You might be able to achieve a heartfelt cry from her for the horrors she's put you through. However, given her history, do not be shocked if she relapses. Especially if she does have an underlying mental health issue, it's going to take a lot for her to stop this vicious cycle she has created.

Let me ask again, what would you want to have happen? What is the ultimate scenario you would like to have happen to feel that restitution has been made, and that you can move on from the angers and grief from all of this?

I hate to say it, but you'll undoubtedly never get whatever restitution you feel you deserve. To put it harshly, they could pass away tomorrow and you'll never have the slightest chance to get the apologies and restitution from them. And that leads me to the next matter.

You do need to find a way to deal with the anger you feel if you desperately want to try to salvage the relationship you have with them. If they died tomorrow, you'd be left with an unhealthy pit of anger. Instead, use this anger as a tool, and turn it into determination if you can. 

Go back to the questions I have asked, and reevaluate your parents. You know them better than I. If you desire to salvage the relationship, you need to discover what you require them to do to know they are sincere and ready to move on, and make sure it is a realistic scenario. Requiring to sit, talk it out and see your father weep for his mistakes just isn't going to happen no matter how hard you beg. Instead, what can he do or say that will show you he not only knows that he has done wrong, but is remorseful about it and wants you to forgive him that doesn't require him to do anything that will make him seem less than a man? I am unable to provide you an example of what could work because I do not know your father.

Do realize that your father may just be a product of his upbringing, or may have a sociopathy of some kind. If I did understand your description on your mother right, I really feel she has some underlying issues, whether it be PTSD or mental health related.

Lastly, I hope you realize this is going to be a very difficult journey for all of you, but especially you. I hope you are taking care of yourself through all of this, and are able to cut things off if the need ever arises. I know I've seen you mentioned you don't want to go NC, but if things get too stressful you need a way to step back if need be and reset yourself. I hope this helps, I hope you find what you are looking for, and hope you can get past this anger you feel."
Cooking,fe9m04y,t3_eo386o,1578939332.0,"So I was never really shown how to cook or bake.

I lived with my husband, 2 kids, and my MIL.

Decided one day we'd make cookies. Except I didn't really know where my MIL kept everything, and she was away. She's one to keep all the spices and ingredients in different jars and whatnot, and never labels any of it.

Kid you not, I asked my daughter (who was *maaaaaybe* 4 at the time) where the flour was. Proceeded to make sugar cookies.

Cookies came out horrible. Baked fine, but the taste was atrocious. Later on I discovered we had baked the cookies with baking powder, **not** flour.

After that I attempted to learn what all kept what ingredients lol."
EstrangedAdultChild,fe9ca0i,t3_eo1i6d,1578936297.0,"There are, unfortunately, two possible answers to all this. Because I do not know your parents, I can only provide for you the possible reasoning for their actions. It's ultimately up to you to figure out what may be the truth of things, and your next plan of action.

You mentioned that your parents are very educated and civil people. It is possible, that they have *mentally* come to terms with the situation, but not emotionally. They may have an emotional disconnect going on (which would be an instinctual reaction to avoid feeling pain). Think of it as a little kid that has gotten into trouble. They can admit they did wrong, but they do not always emotionally feel the wrongdoing of what they've done. This can be because they haven't emotionally matured to feel it, or have just disconnected.

However, it is possible that, during your LC, your parents have come to terms with their errors, and have grieved for their mistakes in privacy. If so, it is completely possible that they have cried and grieved so much that they are either A) in a state of numbness, unable to experience emotions right now due to the raw feelings of guilt they have previously endured, or B) are even past that stage, and are emotionally ready to go on. I doubt B, because I figure they *would* show some sort of emotion during your therapy session. 

Let me ask you, did they even once ask for your forgiveness, or just admit to their wrongdoings? 

This is a hard scenario to break down and figure things out. My best advice for you to figuring out what emotions your parents are (or are not) experiencing, is to think back to an emotional time. Have you all experienced a death of a close friend or family member? If so, how did your parents grieve? Did they mourn as long as an average person would, were they stoic and emotionless the whole time and never shed a tear, or did they cry at first but got over the grief quicker than everyone else? The answer to this will help you sort out how your parents emotions work, and shed some light onto their actions during therapy.

Ultimately, it will be up to you to decide. I don't know your parents, I can't help you figure out if they are cold people, or quick at dissecting their emotions and are genuinely ready to move on.

However, if you are NOT ready to move on, say something to your therapist. If your parents truly have come to admit their harm they've done to you, they should be accepting of you wanting to grieve a bit longer.

Express to your therapist you are not ready. Take what I have said and figure out the emotional maturity of your parents. Or, alternatively, ask them in front of the therapist if they have ever cried about their actions. If you believe they will tell the truth, then being upfront in this situation may help you get the answers you desperately seek.

I am so sorry you are going through such a horrible situation right now. I hope my words will help you out in any way. You are very brave to have come this far with them."

bujo,fe5g15g,t3_enooiu,1578869007.0,"I have a yearly bills tracker on one page. Each bill is listed on the far left column, and across the top I have all the months listed. Every time a bill comes out, I write it's total here. It helps me to see what's consistent, what fluctuates, and if it's paid.

The following page (yearly bill tracker on left page, now we're on the right) I track yearly income. Far left column I write down whose paycheck (I'm married) and how often. I used to get paid bi-weekly, so I would at most get paid 3x a month. So I'd have my name listed with ""week 1"" next to it, then again for the next. Then I got switched to weekly paychecks, so at most I'd get 5 paychecks a month.

Then, across the top I listed each month. After we got paid, I'd write the total amount down, and had a ""Total"" row where I add the total of all of our paychecks for the month. On the same tracker, I would also have a row dedicated to listing the total of all bills (this doesn't include debts or food, just the total of all bills). Then, the next row I would subtract the total of all bills from the total of all of our paychecks to get our grand total leftover money. This tracker helps me to see that if one month we seemed to have struggled more, I could see if our leftover money was less than previous months, and if not, then that means I need to look into where I spent the leftover money.

On my monthly page, next to my calendar, I make a 2 column bills tracker. Left hand side I list the name of the bill. Right side I leave blank until the bill has been paid, then I write it's total down on the right, and also on the yearly tracker I mentioned earlier. Since I look at my monthly constantly, this is a quicker way for me to see what has come out, and what has yet to come out. Below this tracker I have the same setup for any debts, and same scenario as bills with the exception that I didn't track them on the yearly tracker. Next to the debts I write the remaining balance after I've paid.

Also on the monthly tracker (either below my calendar or on a separate page) I figure up expenses. I know the average income we get, and I can usually get a good average on what our bills amount will be. I subtract the two amounts. Have kids, so I subtract allowances for them. Also subtract the amount I plan on attributing towards debt. Then I look at my schedule for the month, and figure up a gas budget. Whatever I determine as the gas budget for the month I will write it to the side and label it ""Gas Budget"". Every time I purchase gas I subtract from that budget.

Whatever is leftover I then figure up how much that leaves me to spend per day and per week. I try to stay within the limits of the week, but with kids it's not always easy. I will write down my totals.

Then, on my weekly (I don't do dailies) I write down in my notes section both the grand total leftover money that I came up with, as well as the **actual** leftover money till next paycheck. Every time I spend money that isn't a bill, a debt, or my gas fund I subtract it from these two numbers. Seeing both totals helps me to realize how much I have left to spend before next paycheck, and how much I feel I have to spend overall. When it gets closer to the next payday, it's easy to go ""Oh, I can afford this, I get paid tomorrow!"". However, having my estimated grand total helps keep myself in check. Sure, I may get paid tomorrow, but in reality I still have only X amount of money left to make it the rest of the month.

I've found doing this method has helped me to save money (whenever I subtract what I've spent, I always round to the nearest whole dollar to keep things even). May not be saving hundreds, but come the last paycheck I refigure everything. What bills are left, gas fund, debts etc and what's leftover from this last check. So far, every time I've done this, my official leftover money is higher than what I've originally figured. That being said, I usually stick with the original estimate I had. If I can avoid using the leftover money, I then pull it out and set it to the side for savings.

Hope this helps!"

I'm not sure of the degree your anxieties lay, but I do have another idea that may help.

Is there any object that you know of that helps you calm down when you feel unconformable? Could be a locket, a stuffed animal, or maybe even a pet. If so, maybe use that comfort item to your advantage as you move into stressful situations.

My son is moderately-severely autistic. When he was very little, he had a grover doll that was his comfort item. He took him everywhere with him. He was small enough to somewhat fit in his pant pockets when he was school age. As he got older, it switched from the grover doll to a purple teddy bear he got for Christmas. Was bigger than the grover doll, but he took that bear everywhere. I kid you not he constantly sat on the poor thing when at home, but held it tight whenever he got anxious or scared.

My daughter has developed anxiety as she's gotten older. She currently has a Porg doll (bird thing from Star Wars) that she uses when her anxieties get bad. She tries not to rely on the Porg doll, but she will get severe anxiety and panic attacks, and handling the doll helps to calm her down.

Do you have an item that helps you? Sure, this is not the best solution to things (becoming codependent upon another object to make you feel safe). However, if your anxieties are severe enough, then it may be an idea to consider. Find something that give you peace of mind so that you can face those difficult situations, and then over time wean yourself off. My son no longer relies on any objects to give him peace in stressful situations. He still has both of his dolls, tucked away in shoe boxes in his closet ""sleeping"" as he puts it, but hasn't touched them in a few years. This was all his doing, we never pushed him to become unattached to his comforts (having a comfort item for an autistic as severe as he is when he has his meltdowns is a godsend). However, he slowly broke away and now can cope on his own much better.

Another thought. One of the big reasons my son no longer requires a comfort item is because his therapist taught him a breathing technique for when he's stressed. I've seen him use it when an ordinary situation would cause him to meltdown or panic, and it works greatly. Has your therapist tried teaching you breathing techniques to help you calm yourself down? If not, may be something to ask. If you know you're about to get into a stressful situation, having the ability to calm yourself by breathing could do a world of good.

I hope this helps!"

selfimprovement,fe2oj1u,t3_engpp4,1578841226.0,"Let me first off start by saying I am so sorry you are going through this.

You are definitely not alone. I had a friend in middle school and high school that was this way, the main difference is she failed to realize it within herself. Every time a report came up where we'd have to present to the front of the class, she'd be home sick. If she got into an argument with her sister on the way to school, her mother would keep her home sick. Band tryouts? Sick the initial day. Band gets too difficult? She'd suddenly become sick right before band class. Her mother almost lost custody of her because she missed more than half of the school year one year and had to go to court over her excessive absences.

It was obvious to us friends that every time a stressful situation would arrive, she suddenly became sick. What's worse is half the time she was sick, her mother kept her home just because her stomach hurt and nothing else was wrong. So because of this, my friend truly equated upset stomach to beginning stages of being sick, not the fact that the upset stomach is a *nervous* stomach, full of anxiety.

I tried to help her, but because she didn't see things from our perspective and didn't see anything wrong with how she's done things, she's now struggling as an adult.

So, I commend you for realizing there is a problem here. You are definitely not alone. I condense souped version my friends story for you, but your story is **very** similar to hers.

I recommend you continue seeing your therapist. Have your therapist work with you to push your boundaries.

Do you use a bullet journal? If so (or not, just use a notebook) and make an ""Anti-Anxiety"" page. Split the page in half by drawing a line down the middle. At the top of the pagyw for the left side, write down ""What I think will happen"", and on the right write down ""What actually happened"". Every time you are about to encounter an uncomfortable situation, write down on the left side of the page what you feel is the worst thing will happen. ""Will be bullied, made a mockery, won't be able to relax"" etc etc. Then, after the event has happened, reflect and write down what *really* happened. If you do this enough you'll notice that your anxieties **greatly** exaggerate the worst case scenario. Use it enough, and you'll be comforted by the idea that what you write down will not happen, because the vast majority (if not all) your past anxieties didn't play out as you feared.

Not sure how you feel about medication, but there are things out there that can help. My daughter has anxiety (different triggers) and has medication that does help her through those situations.

Take baby steps trying to build yourself up. What are small things you can do now to push yourself? Can you handle going to the grocery store or therapist alone? What about going to the library and asking about the location of a book (irreguardless if you know how to find it, the point is to find those uncomfortable moments).

Also, figure out what exactly makes you afraid. Is it 100% just going outside of your comfort zone, or is it the interaction with strangers and unfamiliar places? Do authoritative figures cause you discomfort? 

I wish you the best of luck. I hope you can find the help you need. I am very proud of the fact that you realize this is a problem that needs worked, and not diluted with the idea that the outside world and unconformable situations are to be avoided. Hearing that, I feel you will be able to overcome this. Just takes one step at a time."
IWantToLearn,fe04zog,t3_enfoy8,1578803213.0,"I recommend visiting r/scienceofdeduction and seeing what's available there.

Few people explain their logic behind their answers, but everyone I've encountered there is nice and will answer any questions if you want to know how someone came to a certain conclusion.

I moved to a completely different city and county (same state), so I dedicated another page to things I would need to do after I moved (visit BMV to update drivers license, visit the new utilities office to get service switched into my name, etc)

I dedicated another page to things I needed to do before moving. Get a U-Haul scheduled, get coordinated with utility company that I was moving and when to switch it over to new place, etc.

I also had a page dedicated to things we'd need immediately after moving in (new washer and dryer, a coat rack cause for whatever reason this place doesn't have a coat closet, etc).

Also made a list of other things we'd need after we moved, but wasn't dire enough to get the same month we moved (extra keys made, new entry rug cause the old one we pitched, went from having 1 bathroom to 2 so extra bathroom essentials for extra bathroom like a bath mat and rug, etc)

Made a calendar of sorts where I outlined the major things that I needed done. Gas company needed to know a week before what date to switch service from old place to new, and when I originally called we were still up in the air as to when the moving date was. Marked down the day and time for the U-Haul. Days designated to going to a Goodwill bin to drop off things we were getting rid of, etc etc.

Also had a page dedicated to figuring up the finances for everything. We had been saving ahead of time, so we had a budget set up for putting money down for everything and still having money for food after we moved. If we could, I bought things we needed before we moved.

Since we were moving to a place we've never lived before, I made sure to call around and make a list of other things. Available pharmacies, grocery stores, nearest hospitals, car repair places, etc etc. Part of this was on the page for things to do before we moved, but also just excitement for moving lol.

Most of my pages were a simple list of things to do under each separate category. Nothing super fancy. Just a name for the category and a list below it. Crossed items off after they were completed so it'd be easier to see what is left to do.

I'm currently not working, so I can't help with you on that part, but I imagine you could use the same method and customize it for work as well.

Was this a cup noodles? They have newer ones that have extra veggies that are really good. 

Won't deny, this looks really good."

I am so sorry to hear about all of this, I truly am. I'd start getting as much if everything together as you can to get a restraining order against them. Your sister has one against your mother, I wonder if since you are a sibling if there is any way you can use her restraining order to help facilitate yours (doubt it, just thinking aloud).

I wish you the best of luck."
findapath,fdzbbi2,t1_fdypfce,1578788475.0,"Unfortunately, you may have to take an undesirable job until something better pops up. 

Another idea (again, an undesirable job, however....) What about unarmed security? Before you roll your eyes, hear me out. For 9 years I worked as an unarmed security gate guard. When I didn't have work, I was free to do whatever. The first half of the time I worked there, cell phones and such were not allowed. During this time I mostly read, then I took up learning to both knit and crochet (made over a dozen projects while working there). Then, the latter half of the time I worked there, they allowed cell phones, tablets, etc.

Yes, there were times I had to do my legitimate job, but I often felt like I was being paid to read and goof off. And the jobs starting pay was above minimum wage. Once they allowed cell phones, I was literally paid to watch Netflix and crochet lol.

Now, this is in the US, but I can't imagine that similar jobs don't exist in the UK. I had no prior training or certification to be an unarmed security guard, and my job wasn't that stressful. The only reason I left is because it was an outdoor job, and winters where I live can be brutal, and I do have health issues, so continuing working outside was becoming really rough on myself. I could have continued with the company and requested a different post (like indoor watching cameras as an example) but decided I wanted to get my feet into the medical field and left."
