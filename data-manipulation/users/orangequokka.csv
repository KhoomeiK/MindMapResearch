illnessfakersgonewild,ffz3ac1,t1_ffyyide,1580362544.0,"And Bethany compares her ""swelling"" with this. 

She better be careful nobody shows her how angry they are IRL. People like her tend to meet someone bigger and badder than her in life eventually."

illnessfakersgonewild,ffw5mbe,t1_ffvxddb,1580285417.0,"Exactly. 

I'm Autistic. I had chronic ear infections, undiagnosed Autism, undiagnosed auditory processing disorder, and a Danish mother with an accent, and had to have a lot of speech therapy. I'm still self-conscious about my ""funny accent"" which is part Danish and part Autistic (my joke). Kids at school always told me ""you talk funny"". 

Bee is about as Autistic as a rock."
