martialarts,ffrwsld,t3_euvwnj,1580167646.0,"I mean, I've been all over the place with my training and a part of that is because cross-training sparring.  When I was boxing, a MT dude kneed me in the face, when I was doing MT a bando guy slashed me open with an elbow.  Both of those made me pick up additional styles to help round my game out.  

Ended up in san shou because it was a striking martial art that at a gym that encouraged competition and sparring regularly.  

A judo guy there started dropping me on my ass, so guess what I added.  Then he started submitting me on the ground because he was a catch wrestler too.  

So At this point in my martial arts journey, I was already doing a lot of different stuff.  Win some lose some.  

my experience is i hate wrestlers.  I have shit knees from childhood injuries and suck at collegiate style wrestling, so my none-standing-straight up throws are awful and my sprawls are bad, so a good wrestler fucks me up a lot of the time.  

I knew a lot of wing chun dudes, and if you can fight moving backwards and keeping your range long, it's a lot easier than it should be to start jabbing them out.  

**Losing to**:  

TKD guys are just bad until that first black belt or so, at least without cross training, but after that, a high level tkd guy can fuck you up fast.  I had one guy, in the middle of sparring put his foot on my throat.  Thankfully, he didn't finish it, but he could have murdered me.  (Amir Killah, bellator fighter)

losing to Muay Thai is often me out landing them and then, them getting a solid clinch, or landing a single solid blow that just ends my goddamned day, usually not to the head, but a body shot (Daniel Spohn, UFC) or a leg kick (Afrozilla, King of the Cage).  

Wrestlers just murder me.  (Like even decent highschool wrestlers if they can eat a few upper cuts.)  

BJJ guys straight up aren't usually a problem.  I train, or used to, or still do, so a straight up BJJ guy usually doesn't have a great striking game or a stellar take down game.  A BJJ guy who wrestles, though... oof.  Or if I have to grapple with a better than Blue belt guy.... also oof.  

Boxing was where I started, and I think entering into a boxing match with one would see me get my head knocked off.  So I don't.  But if I can kick, I never had a problem with a boxer.  They tend to keep their feet closer together and duck their heads into shots, so low kicks cause a lot of damage.  

I have black belts in Shotokan Karate (which I don't like, but had to train in as a work related thing) and Hung Gar/ San Shou, and have fought a lot of both of those styles.  Along with a lot of other types of japanese and chinese martial arts.  Win some, lose some."

Long story short, I punched a cop in the pit (I didn't know it was a cop, so when he tried to grab me from behind I head butted him, then he punched me, then I punched him.), got dragged out, and I thought I was going to jail but they just threw me over a fence in the back (one had my feet one had my shoulders, one at my hips).  I thought I was going to get arrested but I just landed in a bush next to 12-15 other punks who had been ejected from the festival.  We just hopped the fence further down and went back in.  

Flogging molly is the best pit I've ever been too.  Not too violent, not too soft, just the right amount of contact for me. Which is why I had seen them 9 times or so.  

Weirdly enough the most violent pits I had been to were a less than jake, where the crowd surged to the front so hard that some people got crushed and needed medical intervention and a slackers/hepcat show where three people got stabbed in the pit.

Listening to their music, it's an easy mistake to make, thinking they would pull a normal crowd and not a punk crowd.  

When the festival opened they weren't ready for the huge influx of people there to see a really cheap show in suburban central ohio.  Before Flogging Molly played, they put up a bunch of barricades and tried to tell the audience not to mosh or anything that might be subversive, and the lead singer, Dave King, winked at the crowd told them ""oh, please don't mosh"", complained that the only beer he could drink was killian's and started playing.

San da fighters tend to keep their hands lower and throw either no combos or very short combos, where other asian kickboxing styles tend to have a higher guard, san da guys tend to keep low hands.  

So does saenchai, coincidentally,  which is why I feel like he was less successful in this fight featured in this video.  he uses a lot of body work and a head movement in his fights to set up head shots, which is very san da.  So I think the san da guys just had more experience in dealing with that style.  

I think san da, san shou, lei tai and other chinese kickboxing styles are so focused on kick-catch-and-throw, that their hands drop more often.  I also think that part of the culture is looking for heavy and clean strikes, rather than punches in bunches, and that's part of the reason you see so many san da guys who can't seem to string together a 5-6 punch combo that doesn't look good at all.

skeptic,fdegrgd,t1_fde7yl1,1578338679.0,"we don't really have a lot of evidence being offered, though.  The lack of evidence, film of his cell being vanished, guards not watching him despite being a high profile-case and him having tried to kill himself before, should indicate that we're not seeing the full evidence.  

Which doesn't mean we should conclude that he was murdered.  Not at all.  It just means that we shouldn't conclude he killed himself either.  It's in the 'I don't know"" phase, which is worrying, since it was such a massively covered story."
skeptic,fdegfxe,t3_ekx1m2,1578338482.0,"I would say, given his crimes, his friends with power, the people who covered up for him the first time through, and the fact that there already *was* a conspiracy by the rich and powerful to shield him from the law, that it's really not far fetched at all that he was murdered in his jail cell.  

I'd say its at least as likely as him trying to kill himself."
OldSchoolCool,fdeet0n,t3_ekvo5k,1578337463.0,"this was about when anthony keidis was fucking underage girls, right?"
CrewsCrew,fdeem4f,t3_ekmp68,1578337344.0,Any word from him on his soft approval of the CPC?
PublicFreakout,fdediwz,t3_ekqms8,1578336662.0,Not a freak out but a pretty accurate break down of a shitty PM.
trashy,fde9uhw,t3_ekouxq,1578334355.0,Is this a cut scene from Ready Player 1 or something?
PraiseTheCameraMan,fddzyxr,t3_ekud8e,1578328045.0,"if you watch the opening bit when he says that, the camera doesn't do a reaction shot of anyone except white folk.  I think at one point there's a black woman's hand."
jews,fddwntm,t1_fdcnc2m,1578325799.0,because look through OP's history?  he's an accelerationist. and because amren is a white supremacist publication? because he has dozens of posts defending nazis?
MMA,fddumn1,t1_fddty6i,1578324383.0,yes.  what has dc ever done besides that to seem immature?  eye can't think of anything else.
MMA,fdcuuw0,t1_fdcdcki,1578284969.0,"I think one of mine, too.  Definitely in the top 5.  

My wife and I had just been married, moved into our first house and both of us were huge Anderson Silva Fans.  We watched silva sonnen 1 together and seeing him pull that triangle out of his ass was amazing.  That might be my 1.  

Watching Stipe pummel DC is a close 2, though."

MMA,fdcd6r8,t1_fdcd189,1578272037.0,Lol.  when he won I woke up my wife and kids all asleep upstairs.  And maybe the neighbors.
MMA,fdcbgs9,t1_fdbxaix,1578270951.0,"I'm, not a team member, but I train at Strong Style, so I am heavily biased towards Stipe.  Every time he got hit, it felt like he got hit ten times."
MMA,fdcb7lh,t1_fdc2auh,1578270795.0,"Well, next to Anik who's as dumb as a doorstop.  

But, I don't feel like DC gets the full rogan worship.  Like Rousey.  Throwing her shitty boxing hands while joe talks about how crisp she looks.  Or Edgar, for some reason.  I remember watching edgar getting the shit beat out of him while rogan talked about how amazing he was taking the shots and how good his movement was... while clearly losing.  I forget who was beating him though.  

Or blowing iaquinta while khabib beat the tar off him.  

Rogan's weird."
MMA,fdbo0ff,t1_fdbjqn8,1578259300.0,That's true.  DC was out landing him by a ton that second fight.  Maybe stipe was holding back to avoid those counter eye-japs?
