I know at my internship, the recruiters made it known that if we wanted to work there full time, they can usually help get your resume to the right hiring managers and that can easily get your resume seen. Seeing as you have worked for the company before, I think they should be able to help you. I’d recommend contact that person and explain to them your situation. 

Also, you should apply to the job postings this company has online. I think having worked there before and having that on your resume might give you a leg up."

Get your resume together. Go post your resume on this sub’s resume roundtable and/or if your school has a career center, go there and ask them to look at your resume and tweak it if necessary. Once you think your resume is good, print several copies to bring with you to the fair.

EngineeringStudents,ff2abg1,t3_er7co7,1579498537.0,"From what you commented you are currently a linguistics major. I’m sure you can imagine engineering or just about any STEM field will be gradually more difficult. Not necessarily the work or the content that’s hard (it is pretty difficult, don’t get me wrong), but the hardest part is managing many challenging courses in one semester and dealing with deadlines, tests, unforgiving/shitty professors, etc. 

I am not sure what courses you’ve taken in the past but you first need to get your pre-requisite courses done in order to get into the major specific courses. This means you will probably have to risk graduating later or taking summer/winter courses to catch up.  Additionally, you need to think about your background in math and science. Have you touched any math or science courses since high school? Were you/are you comfortable with taking those courses? Without taking those classes and doing well, you won’t last in the program.

Also, do you know what type of engineering specially? Civil, mechanical, electrical, etc.? Think about and research each major. Research jobs that require such major and see which role you think would be interesting to you. 

I would advice that you transfer to a community college for a couple years, take the pre requisites you need. If you do well, you can transfer to another college or to the college you’re at now as an engineering student and finish up your degree."

1. Start off with cardio. I usually do 30mins of cardio or 1 hour (if I don’t feel like weight training). Just a run/walk on incline on the treadmill, or the elliptical, whatever. It’s a good way to start, think about what you may want to do after. 

2. Now, do some weights. Luckily, the machines at most gyms are usually placed in such a fashion where all of the machines that work on the upper body are grouped together and all the machines that work on the lower body are grouped together. Makes it pretty easy once you’ve figured out which groups you want to work on. So for example if you want to work on legs. Find one leg machine (i.e., leg press) do a few sets of about 10-15 reps, then rotate to the next. 

3. If you want to, end off with ab training. I always add ab training at the end of my workouts. Simply because they are relatively simple and its a body part I want to target. A simple workout is sit-ups, but you can also make use of ab machines at your gym. 

If that’s not what you’d like to do, you can end off with more cardio (another 30 mins) or stretching.

Hopefully this helps you out."
