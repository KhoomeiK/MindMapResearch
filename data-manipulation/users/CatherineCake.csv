depression,fg8i6dg,t1_fg83z2f,1580620239.0,"And there's so many people out there that too, I mean you even see it in social media, like tik tok. There's a bunch of kids addressing the feeling of anxiety and depression but pull it together in front of everyone and seeking help is such a task. It's a discouraging process that most people with a mental illness probably don't feel like can do it. An online application would be a game changer."
