space,ffmk3r2,t1_ffmf0p0,1580055811.0,"Earth has about 5.5 quadrillion tons of gas, according to google, so youll need more than a few trillion tons.
That number isnt even remotely feasible


My plan was to have small drones slingshot around gaseous planets, suck up atmosphere as they fly by and deposit it on space stations around mars that would then deposit the gas on the planet. It would take a very long time though"
space,ffmijwy,t1_ffmgsgk,1580055236.0,"Some guy did calculations and even if there was magnetic field, there isnt enough frozen co2 or other gases on the planet to yield any substantial atmosphere. If it was like 0.001 percent earth's atmosphere. Now, I think at best it raises to like 0.02 percent. (Throwing those numbers out there, but the real ones are something to that effect)

Whatever the change was, it wasnt even enough to bring mars up from sub-0 temperatures"

It's just got so many flaws...

Like, babies are 72% water, so if walking on a baby could translate into walking on water... it doesnt translate into walking on 72% of water and so also 72% jesus...you're just walking on water, period. But its not the same of course.

And then... If walking on that small amount of water counts as walking on water, I walk on wet ground every time I go out in the rain, I've walked on so much water in my life... by that, we're all jesus eh?"

Working at all guarantees you a home, plenty of food, a mode of transportation, healthcare,  and a bit extra for some leisure.

Working harder should equate to more leisure.

Done. Thats it. All socio-economic problems solved for the working class.

We have the resources to do this in the world"

So our communications efforts only extend for less than 100 light years. Everything we receive will also be delayed by that long.

If a civilization was formed 30,000 years ago but theyre 40,000 light years away... We still have roughly 10,000 years to wait before receiving those signals. Be patient y'all"

creepy,fcke3yy,t1_fchoq31,1577723278.0,"Could be, but also I think wrinkles are a result of osmosis, the concentration of water outside the cells is greater than inside, so they absorb water and expand in size. As a result, the skin expands and with no where to go, you get wrinkles.

Similar to bumps on the road - on hot days the road expands and with no where to go, it expands upwards, and so we get bumps in the road, and cracks etc"

I would throw whole packs away (in some public trash etc), sometimes before even smoking a single one. That way I would cut myself off until buying another ""bridge"" that id also throw away.
My dislike of throwing money away was reinforcement towards quitting.

And the fact that it was better for me to throw it away than smoke them was also a good logical backing to keep doing it"
