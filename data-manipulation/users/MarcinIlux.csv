SuicideWatch,ffgzz1s,t1_ffglnmx,1579919434.0,Well one worked didn’t it? Just because you can’t afford it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.

TooAfraidToAsk,ffbzlut,t3_esnky2,1579787689.0,"We give human names or traits to things because we create an empathic bond with them. When you name animals, plants, or in this case, cars, it makes you feel closer to them."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffbzcnt,t3_ertrnm,1579787491.0,"It is greatly discouraged in my country, precisely because it creates disparaging dynamics between employees, makes for competence where there shouldn't be. They get a fair salary and everyone is content to do their job exactly because they don't have to think about trampling others by letting themselves be over worked, abused, humilliated, etc.

TooAfraidToAsk,ffbyrmr,t1_ffbpd46,1579787021.0,Well you too. But I think you're looking for [r/waifuism](https://www.reddit.com/r/waifuism/) . They have their own communities and all.
TooAfraidToAsk,ffbygub,t1_ffbxheo,1579786772.0,"I get where you're coming from, and if it's worth anything I think your instincts are right. It IS creepy for a man that age to find a 16yo kid attractive.   


But remember these people have been married for 27 years, they got married not shortly after that time when they were around the same age. Good question tho."
