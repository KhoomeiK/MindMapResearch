NarcissisticAbuse,ff9we4e,t3_esd2sq,1579722965.0,"I had the same cathartic experience years after the discard. When I was discarded, it was because another well-meaning person was taking my place. Already lined up and waiting. I didn't take this news well. I had wasted 10 years of my life on this person and I was extremely unstable. We had just went on a romantic cabin getaway weekend and I thought everything was great. Little did I know it was my last supper. I spent some time in a mental health recovery program, had my shoelaces taken away, nearly lost my job.

All this was portrayed to the next victim as me being insane and the reason I was being replaced. Funny how I'd never had a mental break before then. She (the replacement) was terrified of me.

Five or six years later I hear through the mutual friend grapevine, lo and behold, the replacement was replaced. She was distraught and beside herself. There was no indication beforehand of being replaced. Finally she wanted to talk to me. We messaged back and forth because she was still a little scared. There's no telling what the narc said about me over the years. I told her that it was made nearly impossible for me to warn her. I was threatened with legal action if I attempted to contact the narc or loved ones in any way so I stayed far away from that mess.

She said she was sorry for being so naive, she said she was sorry for the things she believed or was spoon-fed. She said she often wondered why mutual friends still bothered with me if I were in fact a monster, she should have known and seen the writing on the wall.

I told her everything I wish someone had told me. It's not your fault, this isn't the end even though it feels like it. This is the start of a newer healthier chapter for you. Even though it doesn't seem like it, your life will be 200% better/easier in the short weeks to come.

TalesFromYourServer,fem3xjb,t1_fem11ea,1579238930.0,"I love him and that will never change of course. At first I completely believed him, I mean, who would lie about something like that? I don't remember getting passed out drunk but something must be up. I came home like a cyclone and ripped through the house to my SO and lit into him. After the first few words were out of my mouth I knew it wasn't true by the look on his face. I instantly felt guilt and regret that I treated him that way. I'd never been like that to him and I could see the panic/fear/disbelief spread across his face.

That alone is hard to let go. That strife I caused in direct reaction to the accusation fills me with intense anger. My SO is and was completely innocent, he did nothing to deserve my righteous rage.

As time passes it gets easier to deal with. I know there must be underlying issues for a child to do this and that is on me. Whether it's nature or nurture I brought him into this world and I'll accept the responsibility of that until I die.

My relationship with him currently is the best it's been for a long time. He's an adult now and life is hard. I can't hold anything from the past against him because he needs all the support he can get. My SO however, he still had major issues that will likely persist indefinitely and I can't blame him either. He is entitled to his fear of my son because it was earned and totally reasonable. He is also entitled to the hurt and anger of it. If I were in his shoes I have no clue how I would react, so I can't judge.

I'm also not here to bridge the gap. I've tried, it hasn't worked. My son will have to deal with the consequences of his actions, which is the destruction of his relationship with his stepfather. There is no trust and lots of fear. He did that and now he has to accept it then figure out for himself how to fix it. An actually apology for the allegations and not just a blanket ""sorry"" for being a heathen would be a good start."

TalesFromYourServer,felxlzy,t1_felvytl,1579233509.0,"We were lucky that we weren't in a position where this would effect employment at the time and school was out so it didn't hit the neighborhood grapevine like a freight train. Most people found out after it was ruled as non substantiated. Even then, people still talked and questioned.

My son has tried desperately over the years to mend the rift. He's apologised for how he treated his stepfather but has danced around actually admitting he lied about the sex abuse and apologising for that. I'm starting to believe my son is developing into a full-blown narcisist. Everything he does isn't his fault and he never excepts responsibility. He always throws others under the bus instead of admitting wrongdoing.

I believe the whole thing came about because he was admitted into a youth counseling program in lieu of being formally charged for vandalism at 16. I think he was angry at his very light punishment and chose his stepfather as an out from going through with the counseling. It didn't work. The counselling became more intensive because it was thought he was dealing with sex abuse trauma at that point.

It seriously makes me feel like a failure as a parent. His brothers don't seem to share his issues and seem like they're developing normally. My oldest son's father is a sociopathic narcisist so I think it may be hereditary. All my children were raised in a nurturing two-parent environment and always supervised unless they were with my parents, which is when most of the vandalism and trouble with the law started for my oldest.

I hope now that he's an adult and is starting to experience some of how hard life is on his own, he will break out of these self centered tendencies. He is living with his father on and off and sees how his father treats others and considers it to be horrible. I hope he understands that his actions can have far-reaching consequences and no one is at fault for his behavior other than himself."

It turned our family upside down and nearly ripped us apart. I don't know what he thought the end goal might be but it was the single most evil and manipulative thing I've seen come from a child, especially my own. It had me questioning myself and the man I love.

It was investigated and eventually there were no findings and the case was dropped but the effects are long-lasting. Even though my son is an adult now the trust between he and his stepfather is forever shattered.
 
His stepfather still refuses to be anywhere near him alone and now that he's an adult, anywhere near him period. I can't blame my SO for these feelings and reactions. This crossed a line that can't be taken back.

My SO couldn't be alone with his own son for one whole summer and investigators asked my two other children questions that shamed and infuriated all of us. Questions you should never have to answer about your own father.

Improving your armor can definitely increase your chances. Also taking some time out to grind the dungeon and level a couple times can do some good as well. If you pair up both of those options it will make the fight easy. You can certainly use scrolls if you want but I try to save my high scrolls for characters after level 60. Low and medium scrolls, you can definitely use those as you get them because they don't really add a significant amount of exp.

That team you have may be great for some content but won't get you through everything. Azami can be obtained with a mixture of 4s and 5s units. She brings a great VC that can aid in the next encounter fight. Also obtaining 5s for your main characters is bit less stressful with encounters in your deck.

This dog was the sleek fierce matron of the whole herd. One time one of the lower rung of the pack had an injured paw and would yelp if he stepped on it and it hurt. The border collie would jump him and beat him down for making any noises indicating he was in pain. It was the weirdest dog behavior I've seen to date. Its the only time I've witnessed a dog not only acknowledge another dog's discomfort but punish it. She did this any time one of her herd would display weakness of any kind, like yelping during a fight or when hurt. I just chalked it up to quirky dog behavior.

This is not behavior you want to be chained to, even if it doesn't happen that often. This is also not one time behavior. Especially if he is refusing to stop drinking. If you don't act on this swiftly and treat it for what it is (abuse) this is behavior that WILL continue and likely escalate. The cat is out of the bag now. When my violent ex finally let his true colors fly there was no holding back. He may have been on the extreme end of the spectrum but these things play out the same regardless.

I watched my best friend go through this twice. Her case is more like yours because the catalyst was alcohol. My ex was simply a sociopath. With her it began as one drunken rage. He came home drunk, she expressed her annoyance probably quite like you did (No partner should feel like they can't confront their SO about bad behavior for threat of harm/abuse, just as a side-bar). She confronted him and he lost it. He didn't physically touch her but flew into a screaming in her face rage and broke things all around the house.

The next day he couldn't remember it, he was sorry. One time thing, never again, cue love bombing phase. The next incident was quite a bit later, half a year. This time he threw a box fan and left a bruise the size of a softball on her thigh. Again cue the I can't remember, never again, love bombing. You can see where this is going. He got physical and eventually threatened to kill her and obtained a gun.

At that point she really had no choice but to end it. She was and probably still is madly in love with him. She mourned him like a death in the family and sobs with her whole body thinking about him. She says when he wasn't drinking he was the best person she knows. However she told me a bit about what a conversation between them was like and the gaslighting was prominent. He also refused from the first incident to stop drinking. This is the straw that broke it all, when she found out his selfish wants were more important to him than even her life.

I never fear pointing out bad behavior to my now SO and he doesn't dread pointing out mine. We discuss it like adults and compromise. Tempers can rise but it should always end the same way. What he did to you was in no way normal, it was a big deal, and it's a precursor for future abuse. If you want to wait it out I suggest doing nothing to provoke him and making an exit strategy just in case. Save some money, document behaviors, and it may be a good idea to secure an emergency place to crash if things get sketchy.
