ARK,ffflgj0,t3_esuh2v,1579886518.0,"The last and only unofficial server I ever played was on MTS. Now usually people give MTS alot of praise and I tend to agree about its advantages. The begginer servers are a fantastic idea and the fact that you could get S+ stuff and actually see what wild levels your Dino's had made the game very nice, as well as having all engrams. But the thing that killed it for me was the community. Sooo many elitist assholes and edgy 14 year olds that thought they were going to be the next kishko that only went on the server because of their favorite YouTuber. I get that alpha tribes, especially on small tribes, are total dicks but at least some of them are nice and alot of the people I've met on official just want to have fun, despite all the disadvantages. MTS was incredibly fun but not once did I ever feel inclined to actually have interactions with other people. Add that to the recent admin abuse scandel and you have a recipe for a poor server."
ARK,fffbqzk,t1_ffdtg6f,1579880463.0,I have a question about that. Are Manas still godlike? Or are they a bit more equal?
Showerthoughts,fff7mji,t1_ffewuns,1579877746.0,That's why I loved alot of the Dan Schneider shows like Zoey 101 and iCarly (though it is a little creepy going back to those shows now knowing that he was a complete creep).

classicwow,ff9182e,t3_es6aga,1579702284.0,I hated the fact that they released the game right as high school started. I had so much time over the summer that I would've liked to be playing wow classic instead.

iamverysmart,fdo81vp,t1_fdo44v9,1578600504.0,"Yeah, it wasn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination but the problem is Disney really didn't come with a plan for the trilogy and movies with solid acting, action, and camera work were seen as less. Mechanically, the star wars franchise is the best it's ever been, Adam driver is great as kylo Ren and John boyega does a good job with getting Finn to be likeable despite his wasted potential. But creativily it suffered and suffered hard."
