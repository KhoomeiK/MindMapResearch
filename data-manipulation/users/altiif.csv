funny,fg82k6y,t3_exbne2,1580607820.0,"I can’t tell you how many countless hours I’ve spent counseling patients about cutting our red meat, eating less carbs (and smarter carbs) and to move a few inches out of your normal work day path.

And yet time and time again they fail to understand how crucial a healthy diet and lifestyle can decrease your risk for cardiovascular disease.

I tell all my patients the same advice. If you take away cancer, the 5 most deadly health issues are high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease and strokes. There isn’t a single pill to treat each one. You need a pill for your blood pressure. Another for your sugars. And a separate one for your cholesterol. But countless studies have shown eating healthy and exercising decreases your risk for all 5.

One patient that stood out to me was a mid 70 year old man who’s been seeing me for 2 years. A year ago I had a serious talk with him about upping his medicine dose because his sugars were very uncontrolled and his risk for heart disease was through the roof. This was after many failed attempts prior to this of him adjusting his diet. Well, this convo did it. He was like “I’m sick of this shit. What do i have to do?” So I told him. Fast forward a year later. He’s lost close to 80 lbs. I took him off his final dose of his diabetic med. And his cholesterol med. Rechecked his numbers and they’re beautiful. And he knocked off a blood pressure med to be down to a minimal dose of just one instead of being maxed out on two."
