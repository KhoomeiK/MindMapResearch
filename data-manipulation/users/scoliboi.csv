It'll get better for you, cause if you're going to marry someone then they'd be there for you no matter what and will be there even if your depression is overwhelming. It took me a while to realize that. You'll find someone who will do all that for you and more, just gotta pull through"
depression,fek2wlv,t3_epj329,1579191465.0,I can definitely say that all of us can understand this very well. Also your name me laugh and that's been diffcult for me lately so thank you
depression,fdwycyk,t3_en7336,1578763495.0,I definitely understand that and it's such a confusing feeling too. This is why I consider depression like a parasite cause it's just latched onto us. It does feel like it's become a part of me and I think that's why it's harder to get rid of it now because my personality has adjusted to being gloomy and sad all the time now.

Anyways i understand what you feel like and happy birthday man i hope you enjoy the rest of your day and congrats :)"
