fatlogic,ffiaqct,t1_ffi6bj6,1579969387.0,"This immediately pissed me off. I have celiac and there’s no such thing as 50% gluten free AND it’s not inherently healthier. I have people ask me why I’m gluten free and I always think WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU DO THIS IF YOU DIDN’T HAVE TO? And this 50% thing is why my friends think that a place with a gluten free menu is gluten free. Most of the time the food is naturally gluten free but not prepared in a gluten free environment aka not safe for me to eat. But it’s trendy so restaurants like to market that they have gluten free stuff when it’s only gluten sensitive. And then there’s when I get a salad and it has croutons and the waiter asks why I just can’t take them off and eat it. Sorry, rant over."
POTS,feiearb,t3_ep9tbz,1579136503.0,"You can do this. I know it sucks. It can feel overwhelming being tired and in pain all the time and not knowing why/not being able to do “normal” things. My only advice is to be very assertive at the doctors. Get a new PCP if you have to (I know it’s easier said than done since a lot won’t accept new patients). I was told repeatedly that I was making it all up when I was in pain everyday.  Even if you don’t have POTS, I’m glad that you are searching for an answer.  If you can find anything that will help even a little, it’s worth the hassle of the endless doctors appointments. Forgive yourself for the things you can’t do and stay strong. (And I got a shower chair, it’s really helpful. I recommend it.)"
fatlogic,fdhjtp8,t3_elfc0z,1578424165.0,"Aren’t there ladders that support more weight? They just cost more. Plus, the person using it might not even be 300#. They could have tools or materials with them too. Manufacturers just don’t want their stuff to collapse. I assume that the user doesn’t want that either. I had to get a harness for work and they asked me my weight to know which to buy. Is it fatphobic that I need a different harness than my coworkers who are bigger/smaller than me?"
POTS,fdhimar,t1_fdg87x1,1578423429.0,I get dizzy sometimes and have to slow down. I’ve fallen while running a couple times but I don’t know if that’s POTS related or me just being stupid. Wearing a HR monitor helps me to know when I need to slow down. I don’t tend to get HR spikes when exercising since my HR is high anyway. It’s hard to tell if your episode was POTS related since you don’t know what your HR was. I think you’ll be okay to work out as long as you are comfortable stopping when you need to and not pushing yourself as hard as you might want to.
POTS,fdg6f1o,t3_el7xjp,1578381902.0,I’ve run marathons and do exercise everyday to help manage the POTS. Just work up to it and feel free to slow down and stop when you feel faint. It might take a while but you can get there. Might not be as fast or intense and other people but you are okay to exercise. I wear a heart rate monitor and you could try that to make sure you don’t have any spikes while exercising.

fatlogic,fdfd7fc,t3_el31wr,1578358936.0,We also make adults (for those in office jobs) sit 8+ hours at work and additional time for commuting. I like to joke that we are not “free range people”. I vote for everyone sitting less. And we should have playgrounds adults can use without looking like a creeper.

fatlogic,fdeii7f,t1_fdeev7m,1578339747.0,"They couldn’t walk the cat walk. I guess you could have an inclusive mobility limited catwalk, which actually might be helpful for people who use mobility aids, but probably not as helpful for the fat logic people."
ElderScrolls,fckugws,t3_eh78fd,1577733447.0,"I got the crown and didn’t want to finish the quest because I didn’t want to side with anyone, did tons of side quests, figured I should actually finish the game and ended up at the conference confused why people hated me. I didn’t care about the war, I was too busy finding shouts and doing dark brotherhood stuff. I didn’t realize that you could fight in the respective battles/join the sides until my second play through."
civilengineering,fb8d0d4,t3_ec0jgv,1576611247.0,What do you mean by traveling? You can have office based jobs that travel to projects or you can have full “travel” jobs where you move to each new project anywhere from a every few weeks to every few years depending on the project.
