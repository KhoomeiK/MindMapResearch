If the people of a country are above a standard, which this sub alone demonstrates on a daily basis with absolutely zero tolerance of a conservative opinion, just like plenty of conservatives demonstrate zero tolerance of a progressive opinion, then it is only a matter of time before the politicians follow suit.

And that's exactly what has happened here and is going to continue happening.

Like, why do you think Bernie is so popular?  It's because he's the personification of a progressive only mindset with virtually no compromise.

And I don't even say that like it's a bad thing for him, his stance is his own and all the power to him for being consistent.  But this same sub was calling CNN utter trash a week ago for going after Bernie too.

Like, would I like my politicians to not be like this?  Absolutely.  I would like Trump to take what he hears from CNN and try to understand what over half the country is looking for from him.  But if we're actually being honest with ourselves, why should he?  There is nothing to gain from it.  In today's political climate, you are either a nazi on the right or a communist on the left, and if you are in-between you are somehow worse."

If the PS guys are serviceable why did you say you knew they weren't going to win a playoff game because of the replacement WR's??

That would be the opposite of serviceable.  That means they're doing the offense a disservice lol.

>We lost half our roster through the season, and still managed to pull players out of thin air and make a patchwork team better than 3 other orgs can manage an entire off-season. So yes waivers and PS players can be serviceable.

I swear it's like you're looking at my Giants flair thinking this is bothering me lol.  All 3 other teams were shit this year.  They all fired their coach.

So wtf are you here debating? lol You're agreeing with what I said.  Like do you want me to admit the rest of the NFC east was pathetic this year?  Yeah, they were.  I literally have no issue saying that.  It's not like all 3 teams didn't fire their head coach lol, they know it too."
nfl,ffisfax,t1_ffiky07,1579981550.0,"Eh, I'll give the guy credit where he deserves it, he transitioned to guard well.  Plenty of scouts proposed guard as a better position for him, Reese was just banking on his athleticism making it work in the NFL at Tackle.

For as much as there is to dislike about McAdoo, he's spot on about Flowers.  He can't bend.  You can't play tackle in the current NFL without being able to bend.  Guard won't demand that kind of bend, so he's a much better fit there.

That's not to say I fault the Giants for trying to make it work at Tackle, considering he had the potential and it's not like they really needed a guard at the time."
nfl,ffirt18,t1_ffilh3d,1579981107.0,"He did, I think the Jags moving on from him so quickly is what (kind of) humbled him about the position.

In fact I think he got benched or fined or something towards the end of the year with Bobby Hart a couple years back cuz they wanted to bench them or something?  I remember Hart got cut immediately.

It would've never worked for him in NY even with a position switch.  The fans despised him.  To a degree I honestly felt for him and wished the fans would ease up, because I honestly never got the impression that he didn't care until the hate just reached a point of no return, and players consistently went to bat for him.  Now, he wasn't exactly a professional about coming back this season either, but I can't imagine what he went through."

Exactly this.

How is the government going to decide who gets to live in NYC or LA vs Detroit, or on a less dangerous but more boring note say Montana?

Like yeah, if I'm not actually paying for it I'll take NYC every day of the week.  But I'm not going to move there now and like barely break even between my salary and the cost to live somewhere nice when I can just wake up slightly early and take a train or work remotely if the weather is bad."

NYGiants,ffiklst,t1_ffij9v9,1579976119.0,"Don’t get me wrong I agree, but I think we need to be fair here as well.

Guys like Smith, Cruz, and Nicks, we just can’t actually know.  They left the team as a shell of the former player they were due to injuries.  (Frankly iirc Manningham, Ballard, and Boss were similar but idk that for a fact of the top of my head.)

I can’t say in good conscience “Eli made Cruz” because Cruz was a hell of a player in his own right and had his career destroyed by an injury.  Him not latching with the Bears was just proof of how bad the injury was.

And Nicks might as well have amputated his foot off because he couldn’t catch a break with that lol.

Not to mention, Jacobs?  The guy was a pure power back who didn’t leave here until he was 30.  Idk how much we can say Eli “made” Jacobs.  Like sure his presence will have eased the defense off the run game a little but thats about it."

You don’t get serviceable production from PS or waiver guys.  You get outright liabilities.  Apple is much better than anything you’d find from either of those.

Like, if Tyree loses I would actually hope it’s to that just because that has genuine historical significance.  We saw first hand the closest team yet get denied that feat.  The catch I’d say is close as well just because it visualized a change in the power of the NFC, but not as high.

The immaculate reception is the one that throws me off though.  They didn’t even end up winning it all.  It’s objectively a crazy play and historic in that regard, but it’s not like you can’t tell the story of the NFL without it.  That play is literally like calling Marshawn Lynches run one of the best NFL moments ever.  It’s a great play but at the end of the day nothing historic came of it."

I think it’s telling that when Arians came into Arizona, not only did he keep Kitchens, but he made him the QB coach too.  And there’s no doubt QB play is what Ariana has made his career on.

His claim isn’t outrageous at all, it’s just this fan base likes to tell itself we’re the only team in the league that ever has to deal with a less than ideal lineman."
todayilearned,ff4d1rg,t1_ff4cls6,1579560739.0,"I’d also argue the game stopped being as physical and more about skill and speed with Gretzky.

Gretzky was skating around guys that wouldn’t even make major junior if you watch some of his goals.

I think Gretzky is basically just McDavid now.  Amazing player, but the difference between the two statistically is when they played."
mlb,ff4cokz,t1_ff48myt,1579560504.0,"Well, tbh it very well could.

A change of scenery, the added responsibility of being a manager, like would he even have the time to do this as a manager?

I’m saying this as a yankee fan too"
NHLHUT,ff43aaq,t1_ff3unsu,1579554602.0,They’re just trying to overcompensate because they don’t want the other person to realize how pissed they are.
NYGiants,ff41as1,t1_ff40a4d,1579553374.0,"Yeah not to be an asshole, but what the hell are you talking about lmao

Carolina finished 5-11, they pick 7th in the draft.  They were no where near winning the division or a wild card spot.

And there are already reports saying Newton is going to be traded in March."
NYGiants,ff3zg1s,t1_ff3yut1,1579552218.0,"I agree,  but you need to accept the same criticism if Carolina hasn’t done anything the next few years.  Or, a worse case scenario, they start going backwards and fire Rhule.

If Carolina is going like 8-8 in 2023, then making Rhule one of the highest paid coaches would be a rightly highly criticized move.

They need to be like perennial playoff contenders in the next few years for that contract to be worth it tbh.  Because that’s what the other coaches in his pay grade are doing."
NYGiants,ff3wmu1,t1_ff3vgk7,1579550457.0,"Rhule is making more already than both super bowl coaches.  That’s absolutely a fiscally irresponsible decision for a guy who never even beat a ranked opponent with Baylor.

I’m not saying Mara and Tisch can’t afford to pay a guy like Rhule or Callahan if they wanted to.

But teams absolutely need to be smart about their cash, and consider when the right time is to spend big and when they should be conservative.  Tepper isn’t worrying about that because his cash is not comparable to anyone else’s cash."
NYGiants,ff3u5t2,t1_ff3t8bg,1579548918.0,"Yeah why should anyone try to make fiscally responsible decisions, like maybe the impact a guy like Callahan has on an offensive line vs the next best option isn’t that big of a deal and not worth the extra money needed for Callahan?

I’m happy Carolina has good ownership willing to get aggressive to win.  That doesn’t mean every other owner should not consider cost vs benefit now."
NYYankees,ff3q8qf,t1_ff3o0bp,1579546510.0,"Lmao if it makes you feel better, I thought this, almost commented it myself, caught it, scrolled to your comment and literally googled his name to see if I was just wrong or going crazy."
NYYankees,ff3nen0,t1_ff3a005,1579544778.0,"Am I stupid because I don’t see how Jonathan contains the name Justin lol

FWIW I highly doubt it’s actually him tho"

Shouldn’t the bar be a little higher than the dolphins rejects?"
G101SafeHaven,ff2wsor,t1_ff2vpmf,1579527076.0,"Completely agreed.

That was more so just a comment about the nature of armchair GMs after every team gets eliminated.

As if getting this close isn’t something to be applauded.  Instead they make it about how “clearly flawed the team was”."

Based on what lol"
G101SafeHaven,ff2uzxq,t3_er8h5e,1579525221.0,"Does anyone else hate when a team loses in the playoffs and all the captain hindsight’s start coming out?

“Of course Baltimore lost Lamar can’t throw”
“Of course Green Bay lost the analytics said they weren’t ____”
“You teams shouldn’t have an elite running back because KC and SF don’t have one”

It’s like they have a smug answer prepared for every single team ready to post like they saw this coming"
NYGiants,ff1rfdi,t1_ff1psvi,1579484528.0,"Yup and that’s all the line, definitely nothing to do with the defense that ranked bottom 5-10 by virtually any measurement.

It’s like frustrating trying to talk sense into you I’m not even going to entertain this anymore."
NYGiants,ff1p7z8,t1_ff1ovln,1579483110.0,I’m guessing you don’t have a single stat to back any of this up
NYGiants,ff1n84o,t1_ff1l0ex,1579481986.0,"[The Giants were 19th in stuffed plays this year.](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ol/2019)  At 20%, they were 1% over league average.

You’re literally getting worked up over nothing.

I’m sure football outsiders is wrong though because we should all just trust your opinion on the same games we all watched."
NYGiants,ff1k7h1,t1_ff1dlgv,1579480506.0,"Dude he’s a running back do you seriously think Saquon is getting tee’d up any worse than any other running back lol

But sure, all the scouting websites are wrong.  We’re the only team without gaping holes every single play."
NYGiants,ff19ilz,t1_ff14yyr,1579476547.0,Yeah you’re being incredibly melodramatic right now lol
NYGiants,ff0v292,t1_ff0hc4s,1579472550.0,"> You are risking the health and growth of your two  top players.   By the time you plug all the holes on this defense their careers will be over due to injury.

Yeah and if we keep ignoring the defense they, especially Saquon are going to get sick of losing and want out.  RBs don’t have long shelf lives.  A 4th straight 5 or less win season is going to be pretty off putting for a guy who is going to want to leave his mark on the game.

> And I used to trust PFF rankings before they started saying our O-line wasn't horrible.

Lol ok so what metric would you like to use? Football outsiders has us around league average too.

This fanbase acts like because we can’t generate a pass rush that every other line is amazing lol."
NFL_Draft,ff0eup9,t1_ff0cubm,1579468235.0,"Ok they also lost in the divisional round if you want to go there lol

They also had a very deep defense period and added the overkill to the secondary last (Thomas and Peters).  They were luxury additions for Baltimore.

The Giants have zero linebackers and zero edge rushers.  They have much bigger needs than adding a third young corner when they can just add a veteran in free agency."
NFL_Draft,ff07t6v,t1_fezzsi8,1579466138.0,"It’s not that I’m sold either, it’s that we have bigger fish to fry and they simply haven’t had much of a chance.

They had no pass rush and the scheme sucked.  We can’t expect to have top 5 picks everywhere lol.  A first and a third round pick, + a former first in peppers is already a huge investment for a secondary."
nfl,fezzd9o,t1_fezyib0,1579463501.0,"Exactly that’s  what I mean.

I can’t blame Miami for moving on at all.

If Tennessee pays Tannehill and he gets hurt next year everyone’s going to say “how did they not see this coming”."
NFL_Draft,fezx6lv,t1_fezwoqx,1579462842.0,"I agree, I’m not calling him that, but rather saying the current secondary (plus a reasonable vet deal to play nickel) is enough and adding Okudah might be overkill.

I believe edge is something that needs to be addressed in free agency and Simmons is the guy to get the linebackers closer to where they need to be."
fantasyfootball,fezv24j,t1_fezrhqr,1579462029.0,I genuinely feel like Tampa bay would have been at least a somewhat respectable answer if we’re just naming any team in Florida lol
NYGiants,fezuo2a,t1_fezquf1,1579461884.0,"They will never win with this defense lol

There was 4 playoff teams this year with a worse offensive line than us per PFF.  We finished 17th in their year end rankings.  Kansas City finished 16th.

We did this despite poor coaching from a guy that very well may be replaced by Bill Callahan.  We have way too many holes on defense to go back and spend big money or a top pick on another OLineman.  It’s simply not that bad.  We look ridiculous acting like our line is the root of our issues every year when various unbiased sources consistently say it isn’t.

I’m not saying ignore the line either, but Edge and secondary have to be the priority this offseason.

We will be picking in the top 5 again if our defense is not significantly better from last year."
G101SafeHaven,fezpxw4,t3_er0esq,1579460185.0,Well he would certainly fit our yearly quota of signing a reject veteran that we don't even need who clearly has nothing left in the tank.
NFL_Draft,fezp9p8,t3_eqz4fa,1579459953.0,"FWIW, I'd imagine a big reason why us Giants fans (myself included) prefer Simmons to Okudah is because we spent a first on Baker last year, used a comp pick on Beal (who was supposed to be a 1st round talent if he went in the next draft) and traded for Peppers.

And at this point I think finding guys who can rush the passer is a bigger priority.  The investment in the secondary is there.  But until they get someone to pressure the QB they will be hung out to dry.  That's not to say they are an elite unit that everyone is wrong on, but rather they are pretty young and I don't think they aren't talented they just have been set up to fail miserably so far."
