I got the backup camera to work but I had to DIG online to find the wire harness in the driver kick panel that had the signal wire to run to the head unit. If I remember correctly it only output 4.5v and for whatever reason that didn’t make the backup camera happy (the display would trigger when out in reverse but no picture was visible) so I had to buy a 12v to 5v converter. When I did that it worked like you would expect. 

Still not for the faint of heart and it was a PAIN."
todayilearned,fehsmdf,t3_ep4ql1,1579123062.0,"My personal Deion Sanders story:

About 15 years ago when I was living near Dallas (Frisco, TX to be exact), I took my family to a Chuck-e-Cheese-esque pizza place early in the morning just as they were opening around 10am. As we're walking towards the building, I notice a fleet of Escalades pull up out front and and a whole crew exit the vehicles in unison. They were all decked out in matching velour Adidas track suits.  Stuntin never looked so good in 2007!  

They all made an immediate beeline inside and just whooshed past the high school kid who was working the turnstile.  I could feel the presence of someone who I knew was clearly ballin out of control - his swag was palpable... I turn and I see him walking up to the turnstile and I pause completely starstruck and unable to think.  As my reptilian brain took over, I just looked at my wife and blurted out ""It's Primetime Baby!!!"".  DS immediately turns around, looks at me, winks and flashes the million dollar smile and then kept marching thru to what I assume was his kids birthday party.

To be in the presence of greatness such as his was humbling and awe-inspiring.  It was basically a near-death experience.  Time stopped for me in that moment and I've never been the same since."

They’ve managed to get the pro-Israel team onboard with literal Neo-Nazi’s. The conspiracy theorist squad in bed with evangelicals. And to put a nice little bow on top they’ve convinced some of the poorest people in the country that tax breaks for the rich will somehow benefit them.

This is without a doubt the worst place I’ve ever lived. It’s miserable here and we’re just waiting for my fiancé’s 17yo son to graduate so we can move. (He hates it here too btw and wants to go to college literally anywhere but here). There is nothing for kids to do, our neighbors are super old. It’s just a weird miserable place

We live in Rancho Mirage, and most people here will tell you to move to La Quinta, but the only kid-centric thing there just shut down due to lack of business (Laser Oasis). 

I implore you, don’t do it."
StarWars,fcyrukh,t3_ejinrx,1578085745.0,"Dooku should have been Anakin's father.  

&#x200B;

The whole immaculate conception thing was trash.  Dooku was a fallen Jedi who cut off Anakin's hand.  The parallel to Vader cutting off Luke's hand should have been the clue which would lead to the reveal in episode 3 which would have broken Anakin when he realized he wasn't ""the chosen one"" as he had been lead to believe and that his mom was the side chick of some Jedi knight who would eventually betray his mentor, as he would inevitably do."
