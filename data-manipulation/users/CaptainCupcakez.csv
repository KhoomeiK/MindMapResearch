>Having a sat nav is no more worse for the environment than people who buy a new phone every 2 years.

That wasn't the argument. You have warped my argument into a strawman again.

I said that encouraging people to buy replacement devices such as TomToms due to expensive roaming charges on mobile phones would be worse for the environment than people using existing devices.

The spending and replacement habits of people overall isn't relevant here. Remember, we're discussing this comment:

unitedkingdom,fgf6828,t1_fgapdzj,1580726679.0,"> I mean why would you need your satnav to do other things

I never said I did. You have missed the point entirely.

The point being made is that the **vast** majority of people under 40 have a smartphone (in terms of those who can drive). So to have to buy another device that only fulfills one function is both a waste of money, time, and it's bad for the environment.

>You shouldn't be on your phone at all when driving

Irrelevant to the conversation. Modern navigation software is identical on phones as it is on dedicated devices. TomTom has an app.

I could just as easily make the argument that your solution is more dangerous, as it frees up the phone entirely to be used while driving.

>And by single purpose, does that mean toasters and kettles are going obsolete unless we create an all might toasttle?

You're making yourself sound very stupid by doubling down on this. The point has flown over your head entirely.

Single-use devices like satnavs are unnecesary because they have been made obselete by smartphones in 99% of circumstances. Your ""reasons"" for a TomTom being better are just weak criticisms of mobile phones in general.

>unless we create an all might toasttle

Ok, let's run with this analogy.

In this analogy, a device called the ""Toasttle"" exists which performs the functions of both kettles and toasters. Additionally, for the analogy to work, everyone already owns a ""Toasttle"".

Your argument is that we should ignore the Toasttle's capability of boiling water, and buy a kettle anyway. You are arguing that toasttle users should have to pay a premium to use their device simply because you don't personally like it and you think people should use the separate devices.

At the absolute minimum, for a referendum such as this to be considered fair and binding:

- It must not be explicitly defined as non-binding (the 2016 ref was stated as ""non-binding"" yet has bound us to Brexit. The public was misled on the nature of the referendum)

- Campaigning needs oversight, and groups that are found to be breaking the law need to be punished appropriately

- If the referendum is to be binary, there need to be two **CLEAR** options. 

- General elections should not be used in place of a confirmatory referendum. Members of the public should not be made to decide between a massively important single-issue and being able to choose a party that represents them on everything else.

Putting complex geopolitical decisions to a public vote without any information on what each option entails is not how a parliamentary democracy is supposed to function. This was a subversion of parliamentary democracy from the moment David Cameron used it as a way to appeal to the UKIP crowd and win the election."

I agree.

Your statement is still wrong.  
Most Brits did not vote for Brexit. That is incorrect. Wrong. False.

>As for not being allowed to vote due too age it is completly unfair to assume what they would have voted for.

I didn't assume, I made a prediction based on the available evidence. I advocated for a second confirmatory vote for that exact reason.


>Allow me to rephrase it so that you can understand ""Out of all Brits participating in democracy most voted for brexit""

No need to use such awkward wording. We all know the outcome of the referendum.

You were being criticised because you used ""Most brits voted for Brexit"" as support for thinking that it is not only a portion of the British public listening to Nigel Farage. You made the argument that because ""most brits"" voted for brexit (which is false) then most would listen to Farage.

Whether intentionally or not, you're also completely ignoring the results of the latest general election. While the conservatives got a working majority, the overall results don't mirror your stance that ""Most brits voted for brexit"""
worldnews,fg019lb,t1_ffzwuz9,1580397973.0,"[Spanish flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) killed 100 million people, which was ~3-5% of the world's population at the time.  
For comparison, that would be the equivalent of ~300,000,000 (300million) people dying today.

Another ~~interesting~~ horrifying fact about Spanish flu was that it was unusually deadly in the 25-35 age range. The virus essentially caused the stronger immune systems of people in that age range to go into overdrive, ravaging the body and allowing it to kill those who would normally be considered healthy enough to fight off a flu virus.

Life is too important to be this flippant about the most vulnerable. Yes, we'll probably be ok. No, not everyone will. For some, this will ruin their lives.

No. They're calling Nigel Farage, a man with a history of racism and xenophobia a racist.

You think that ""everyone"" is being called a racist because you support plenty of people who are willing to be racist.

That's a load of wank. You are still a real racist regardless of how racist you choose to be.

Maybe don't be mildly racist if you don't want to be conflated with strong racists.

No, it's still just as clear as it ever was.

Nigel Farage is a racist due to his history of racist and xenophobic views. No one is being called a racist who does not share racist views."
worldnews,ffzz46l,t1_ffztid2,1580396537.0,"> Most brits voted for brexit?

Completely false.

51% of people **who voted in the 2016 referendum** voted for Brexit.

Millions did not get a vote as they turned 18 within the last 4 years. Millions got to vote and then died before any of it was implemented.

10s of millions couldn't give a single fuck and will never vote in any election or referendum. It's incredibly disingenous to put all of these people into the camp of ""voting for brexit""."

It's just so incredibly obvious that you know the majority of the country doesn't want this.
