Advice,ffq165x,t3_eul66a,1580114739.0,"so, i've had the similar issue as you have and it's really beating on my optimistic outlook. i thought so highly of it, and then it all went out the window and next thing i know i'm panicking constantly. my boyfriend keeps telling me to look at the positive and know that this is the start of 2020 and it's shitting out what was left of 2019.

i know its hard and scary, especially when you feel like looking hopefully will just get you crushed but my sound advice to you is: look for the positives. i don't want to list positives for you in things because I don't want to accidentally trigger you. but they are there.

my second sound advice is: get away from the media. it's difficult, but the media is taking full advantage of the anxiousness of the people and will convince you in two seconds something is more horrible than it actually is. fact check material and if you can't do it, find someone who can. the people on reddit are really good at doing that, especially here in advice and no stupid questions. 

i hope you feel better, bud. hang in there. find something to look forward to."

Advice,ffq0g98,t3_eukxow,1580113669.0,"Smoking and vaping contributes for sure, but reading it reminds me of anxiety. I think feeling it the first time was a little trauma inducing to him so he's bound to feel it again. Check list anxiety symptoms with him. Its hard to tell sometimes because they can mimic so many issues, but anxiety is usually the common culprit. 

As always, if he gets too antsy, head out to the er. You can do a test run there too and have him sit in the wait room. If it balances out in thirty minutes, probably panic. Nothing to dismiss though, do take it seriously. It can cause lots of.issues."

Most rates are anywhere between 70-120 dollars. Online therapy seems to be a cheaper alternative and is just as good with better access to your therapist, however I find it asks for a lot of money upfront so it's daunting. At least for me. 

You find a therapist depending on the issue you are having. Try to find how you're feeling and what you think is up with you then match accordingly.

There's no number of sessions for good fits as you will likely know whether they are or not pretty quickly. However, if you're on the fence about them by the first one, I'd say try two more and decide from there whether you want to see them again or not. Make sure you're comfortable with them, that you feel safe with them and that they are not only listening to you, but helping you."
DID,ffjbjr4,t1_ffj8oqq,1579994846.0,"Okay, then that is completely acceptable and I am sorry for assuming otherwise and making an ass out of myself when I didn't know the full situation. I also apologize if my comment hurt your feelings or made you feel bad. On that end, the tides have changed and now I am uncomfortable for you because she is not compromising with you and your body. It seems now, with this context, that she's...as I would put it, 'softly pressurizing' and that isnt health for you or for her. The guilt factor is really upsetting and starts to enter abusive territory really fast if not addressed. 

I still do think you should talk to her and be honest and maybe see if any of her alters who feel dissatisfied will also speak up about it. Sex is important, but it shouldn't be more important than your comfort and safety. Keep us updated, if you'd like. I hope you guys work things out and find some positive resolved."
DID,ffj7uf1,t3_etxf63,1579992559.0,"Okay, I was on board until the promise thing. You kind of manipulated her with that one in my opinion, and I can see why she's upset with you. You need to learn healthy boundaries and you need to learn when to say to someone, I may not be able to return the favor tomorrow, but I will try. If it does not work then, we can compromise. 

You're not completely wrong about sex promises being different, but she's your partner, you agreed to being honest and working with her by getting into a relationship. The fact that you knew you broke your promise and knew it would make her feel bad and waited until she expressed she was upset about it to bring it up at all makes me uncomfortable for her. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something or not quite getting it right, but I don't like that behavior. 

As someone else said, you should have a talk about this with her. It's fine you asked for advice, I'm glad you reached out but there seems to be a lot of give and take and give and return concept in your relationship that needs to be addressed before it gets super unhealthy for your both. Be honest with her. Encourage her to be honest with you."

SuicideWatch,fejb2t5,t3_epg54e,1579165018.0,"> I often feel angry with her for no reason. 

you don't feel angry with her for no reason, bud. you feel angry with her because she's been cruel to you and you don't deserve that cruelness. i can't tell you what to do, but i'll give my two cents anyway. please in the future, either speak with her about this and how deeply it hurts you or find someone else to put your love into. there should never be a time in your relationship where your girlfriend tells you to kill yourself. ever. your relationship sounds very unhealthy and it pains me to see that you're blaming yourself for having negative feelings around a woman who should be lifting you, not shaming you. 

if your biggest worry about killing yourself if that you're afraid she'll think you're a loser, then please, think about your relationship and what would be better for you. if you absolutely do not want to leave, i do suggest communication with her and letting her know that it's not okay what she has done. you deserve so much more than that."
SuicideWatch,fejatdx,t3_epgo3v,1579164640.0,"you're very young, almost ten years younger than me. i remember being 18 and thinking similar. you know, that there was no place for me here. it's been a rough journey, but i've found smiles along the way. don't get me wrong. i've found sadness too, pain and hurt, but lots of smiles.

people we love leave us, it hurts. by god does it make your heart feel like its swallowing itself whole and becoming a pit of a fruit that was once luscious but is now gone. but there's more to life than them. there's more people out there. maybe it's difficult to see now, but if you stare long enough, there's something there for you. there's people there for you. another person that will come along and take the pit of your heart in their hands, then plant it. then more people will join them, all helping to blossom a fruit that you, yourself can enjoy, savoring every taste.

i hope that maybe, just maybe, you'll be able to read this before you leave and change your mind. that maybe instead of going out to end it all, you'll take a midnight drive, look at the lake  tonight and force yourself to smile. that maybe you'll release tears from this action and see the beauty surrounding you, how the water reflects the sky, how many beautiful beams of light are there and how serene it is. and i hope you'll listen to your playlist, enjoy it as you allow yourself to weep for your pain, for your inner hurt. and i hope you'll tell yourself that you deserve more, that you're worth more, and that you'll nurse your body's cries with love, even if just for tonight."
SuicideWatch,fejagbo,t3_epglax,1579164118.0,"reading your post made me start crying, first most. not a horrible thing, don't feel the need to apologize or anything, i'm just hurting deeply for you. 

it's scary to revisit the pain. it's the scariest thing in the world to have to reflect back on everything that has hurt you and that has left you feeling as if pieces of you are missing. it's horrible and terrifying to have to look on your friend's passing and have to think of it again. but i think if you are considering help, it's the best option for you. the fear is trying to stop you, as fear will do; but speaking to someone about it all, might help you find some peace with it all. 

in between that, i'll give you some advice of my own. i don't believe your friend is really gone and no, this isn't some religious statement or anything; but we take on the ones we lost, holding them tightly in our little chests. i light candles for the ones i've lost and sit and admire the candles for them, thinking of everything. i allow myself to cry, to scream and to say things to them aloud. it hurts, but i want them to know. how much i miss them, how much i'm hurting, how much i loved and to this very day love them. might not be for you, but thought i'd drop that in for you."
SuicideWatch,fej9zea,t3_epfoxf,1579163450.0,"> I am 27 without a purpose

we're the same age, first of all. which leads me to tell you that we're both still insanely young. our life has barely just begun, even in our late twenties and there are so many paths and purposes awaiting us. it's impossible for us to all find them at once, and you're included in that. if not now, then later, if not later; then surely, it'll come. think of your interests, things that give your heart an image of passion when you reflect on it. think very deep because it's likely pure tar is all you're going to see at first. 

talk with your boyfriend, express yourself. the answer might be scary, but it might be what you need. maybe it won't be scary, the future is unpredictable, isn't it? 

with therapists, it takes a bit of time to find the right one. i suggest looking for trauma and specifically bipolar disorder ones; though trauma ones typically are equip to handle the most. it's worth a shot because they can help, we just have to find one that's made for us. sort of like shoe sizes, yeah? if it doesn't fit, we find a different one. we can walk barefoot, but it hurts and makes us rough around the edges. stupid analogy, but i hope it makes sense.

you're not wasting anyone's time or making anyone reading. surely not mine. i'm glad you posted so i could stop by and hopefully help you in some way or form. if not, i won't take offense; it's difficult sometimes. but you deserve more than you're feeling in this moment."

therapy,fe6s5qt,t3_eo118j,1578902854.0,"so, i don't want to get you down or make you feel worse but self therapy is incredible difficult to do. first and foremost, i really suggest getting a therapist. if you can't for whatever reason (not going to get into it b/c personal reasons are personal), then let me get you started and on the right foot.

firstly, get a journal. this is going to be your new buddy. name it, put stickers on it, do something to make it yours. there's a reason why teenage girls write in journals in movies and it's because it's cathartic and therapeutic. the journal is a place where we can store our thoughts and get them out of our heads and self evaluate in a place that has 0 judgement and is entirely our own personal space. it's the home inside your home, where nobody else goes. when you write in your journal, do some key things:

* express yourself sincerely. write the negatives of your day. how you feel. what you wish you could do that you aren't. what you want to be different. vent it out. nobody is watching and your journal wants to know.
* on lower end days, such as when you feel lesser; try self-taught DBT therapy. i'll link you to the sub for DBT here:  dbtselfhelp . read the first post, get the work books you feel are fit for you and practice them. always practice them. mindfulness opens the eye to understanding yourself. this should help give you tools to self soothing.
* self reflect. always self reflect. ask yourself in your head AND journal. why do i feel \_\_ about \_\_. why did i feel \_\_\_ today? this is training your brain to find causes for things. sometimes you won't find it, and that's okay! know that it happens! sometimes we just have bad days, and that's alright.

whenever you find your journal is full, you're free to do whatever you want with it. some people keep them and store them to reflect on later. some people toss them. some people burn them. it's up to you. but really. i realllllyyyy put emphasis on the journal thing.

another thing that is good to do is meditation. everyone will tell you that one and lord does it get annoying to hear. but 10 minute a day session of meditation helps clear your head so you can think straight. you don't have to go into deep ends of it, but just enough to feel refreshed, like someone pressed f5 on your day and you're going from sad to controlled. try to do it at least 3 times a week. just to reset yourself.

giving yourself a therapy session is also great. this is building a straw therapist that can be anyone. a prior therapist, a family member, a doctor, a character; someone who you find comfort in is now in the imaginary seat from you. (i really suggest doing a character since they're not personal and can't suddenly hurt you, but that might just be me). make sure this is someone with good morals and a good moral compass, not your drunk uncle or pseudo norman bates. internally talk with them. state an issue you have an envision what they might say or how they respond. this is a self soothing exercise that can really help with struggles! you can also do this in your journal.

my last bit of advice is learning mental health. educating yourself on it. reading into practices therapists use and figuring out how to apply them to yourself. they may not be the authentic thing, but they're still something, which is better than nothing."
freelanceWriters,fe6q869,t1_fe6ph6x,1578900306.0,"thank you again for the response, you've put a lot of heart into it and i can feel the wisdom coming from the seams. 

my issue is i'm not talented with articles or understanding business perspectives. when i look for writing gigs, i really see a lot of marketing involvement and while i can act, pretend and write you a whole spiel of: Cranker's Cookies, sweet in creamy, chocolaty flavor like the nostalgia of your fondest memories! it's not what i feel like my fullest potential is made of. i'm great with characters, settings and stirring a hearty soup's worth of psychological sense of humanity in both, but that's just not what anyone wants in a writer, so it's confusing and frustrating. 

i will take your advice and mill around, work on things in my own time. maybe i'll get lucky and make a break and find myself becoming like Michael Chu in Blizzard and designing stories or personalities for characters that people want more from. maybe i won't. it'd be nice to have some semblance of sensation in success and productivity with something i've done for years, but who knows. i'm 27 years old and there's probably tons out there to learn.

again, thank you. it's meaningful to have someone speak to me and right me even."

&#x200B;

you tried it, it didn't work and now you have the chance to try a different plan. relapses happen, it's part of growing and learning. if you don't do it, then you're not learning as efficiently as you should be. take your negativity and turn it, flip it to motivation and positivity. ditch the nihilism and focus on your initiative. what plan do you want to have? do you want to give yourself time on the internet? do you want to leave it for good? figure all your goals out and WRITE THEM DOWN; i suggest a journal. 

i also suggest taking baby steps. if you don't think you can handle deleting your browser right now, fine. that's OKAY. change the plan up. do something offline for a small amount of time (i use an hour for myself), then allow yourself a prize and praise for it. internet time! slowly but surely you can use a method like this to feel better about yourself.

if that sounds horrible, i suggest portioning your day. make your plans ahead of time and plan the day out. this helps your brain organize and also feel productive when you mentally or physically check off your list for the day. for an example:

you get what i'm doing here? planning your day leaves little room for you to get bored, reach over and grab your phone. my issue i struggle with is i do everything and then struggle to find what else i need to list. like, i clean my living room one week, it's still pretty clean next week and then i have nothing to do when i need to reuse that. maybe you'll be different, or maybe you can figure it out."
freelanceWriters,fe6on3g,t1_fe6nwr2,1578898363.0,"thanks for the response.

i guess i'm not ready, because reading all of this made me feel exhausted and unmotivated and i haven't even moved an inch to do anything about it. really i just want to write and create things with people, do gaming writing, fictional writing, so on and so forth. i have talent, that's been evident since i was really young; but having to pretend to be interested in things i'm not breaks my soul and i just don't think i have the patience to do that. (yay adhd) 

i don't really know where to go from there, and sorry that i'm just getting ranty on you, but i feel like i have no place in this world and that my talent is worth nothing."
DID,fe6n746,t3_envjs8,1578896729.0,i have trauma memories too. remember that systems are never the same for everyone.
therapy,fe6mpfr,t3_eo04nr,1578896196.0,"hey, op. first of all, it's good you admit you're obsessed with someone, that makes it easier to start moving forward. second, it isn't abnormal to masturbate to someone you like and is pretty common among men, women and nb pals. 

now this is just advice from me, someone who isn't a professional; but i feel as if you may want to focus on other things aside from this girl. if thinking about her is causing these feelings in you, it doesn't seem like a health practice and should change. obsessions are not good things to hold onto and we need to learn when to let them go so that we can feel better about ourselves."

therapy,fe6lphp,t3_enz37t,1578895121.0,i think that's really normal and i struggle with it myself. which makes me look dodgy and up to no good and has gotten me accused of stealing once in a store. all because i couldn't look someone in the eye and avoided being around people. it's something you should bring up with your therapist and you might find really helpful answers with it.

DID,fdu1zv2,t3_en3pvm,1578726096.0,"welcome to the sub first and foremost, but second..i'm sorry you've had to go through a lot of these things along the way. everyone here is nice and helpful and really warm and welcoming, which is a huge refresher because most people kind of laugh at the thought of DID. i think being here, you'll find that you're not alone and have a safe place to talk about your feelings and the situations you're going through, and i hope that you feel better letting some of this off your chest!

i'm not a professional, but i think you should talk to your therapist whenever you're comfortable with him about your fragments (if you'd prefer me to say alters please let me know) so you guys can start getting on a path where you can work together and not apart. it's not fair that you, as the host i'm assuming, are not allowed to make friends or interpersonal relationships with others. you seem overwhelmed and distressed and i think working with a therapist to get it even will really help you learn more about your fragments, yourself and how you can all work together."
Advice,fdti495,t3_emzwk7,1578717081.0,"Watch out for other key signs. If you can, talk to him and reach out, try to relate and find sensitivity in his feelings. Teenagers get over stuff fairly quickly, but it's good to help scoot them along and be there for them."

Austin,fdpctna,t1_fdpcn0y,1578625397.0,"yeah, that's usually what i do when these heavy storms come in. just talking here has helped settled the anxiety a little bit and gotten me out of my head enough to think clearly and assess the situation with optimism rather than 'we're all gonna die' lmfao. hope you're not too nervous or anything either man"
Austin,fdpcfr6,t1_fdpc969,1578625132.0,"yeah north does get bigger hail
hail doesn't bother me much, just kind of jarring when it happens
hopefully there won't be any tornadoes this year, climate change and storms got me nervous"
