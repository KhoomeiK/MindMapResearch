spartanrace,fdrguot,t3_emek9m,1578684355.0,"I agree with AA OCR on the differences.  

To me, the elevation is the biggest difference. WV I felt I could build up some running rhythms on some flats and NJ was always at some sort of grade and more a hiking type course.

However, I actually felt the obstacles at NJ were tougher, but I also had an off-day and failed 2 obstacles I never failed before and haven't failed since at NJ such as beater and herc hoist, so I may have been an outlier. 

As far as venue and atmosphere, I'd say WV was amazing.  WV is a beautiful venue and has been the North American Championship the past 2 years and is a national series race in 2020 so there will be some top racers and some more media there.   WV was a little cloudy of a day this year but in 2018 I remember being awe struck by it.  

Lastly, WV includes a legitimate swim of 800-1000 feet in case that matters to you."

spartanrace,fbghr54,t3_ect394,1576849812.0,"My favorites are

Palmerton- brutal mountain course but such an accomplishment. 

Killington- another brutal mountain course but the resort there becomes a spartan owned weekend and beautiful foliage and the escape of being in Vermont. 

Tuxedo- where I did my first Spartan, and a very mountainous sprint and as you can see I like mountain courses

West Virginia- beautiful venue and also an area that becomes a spartan invasion for the weekend."
