Oh, he's attractive. But none of the huge amount of attractive actors strikes me as much as... Robert Pattinson! :-P When I look at his pictures, I don't even like those ""perfect"" pictures so much. I like the ones where he's caught off guard and just laughs."
AskWomenOver30,fdwfamd,t3_en6zsf,1578758137.0,"When I am in a relationship I would never cheat, I am romantic, cuddly, nice, loving - I put my whole heart into it.

But in my 20s I was four years single and I enjoyed those years. I broke a lot of hearts and my heart got broken a few times. And I had hookups! It was fun and I don't regret it at all. For me it was super exciting - I had a list and wanted to increase that list now and then. There were 2 or 3 occasions, where I now think ""how could you"" but I still don't regret it. There weren't risks of an emotional connection. The ones that were with feelings I din't see as hookups. Those are the ones who broke my heart, but it just didn't work out. My bf of 8 years also doesn't know my number and I know he would think less of me if he's know. But that was my life and everything in my past made me the person I am. So yeah, no regrets.  


EDIT: your other questions: If I was single again, yes, I think I'd do it again - but not as much as 10 years ago. Though compared I don't think it were so many.  And why I did it? It was fun. I had the desire and it was like a game to me (that's why the list). But again, I still don't think I was excessive. It was 10 men in total. Hookups and men I was fond off."
offmychest,fdvgksd,t1_fdswepk,1578747162.0,I always thought it's not the most romantic story. But I guess it is quite rare. Also given the fact that he couldn't see me. I wasn't willing to show myself to strangers.
offmychest,fdvg205,t1_fdryfq0,1578747091.0,I'm also from Germany. :-) But I was only one hour ahead of my bf.
offmychest,fdvfwkx,t1_fdrmaqs,1578747037.0,"Yeah, I knew what I got from the beginning. No surprises. :-P"
AskWomenOver30,fduwlqc,t1_fdt22rh,1578740079.0,"Haha I'm glad to hear!!! In my head I also imagine just breaking up my life here and moving to London. But then even if I did, how big is the chance to be a the right place at the right moment, so we get to know each other within the millions of other people living there."
offmychest,fdsrbuw,t1_fds6ttc,1578706937.0,:O Really?!?! Why that?
AskWomenOver30,fdrq9ob,t1_fdrmkpc,1578688124.0,"Oh, that makes sense! Thank you so much for this. I am in a struggling relationship and have been thinking about breaking up the last 2 weeks. So maybe that's the explanation for my weird strong feelings. Anxiety and stress totally fit."
offmychest,fdri8f4,t1_fdri0ei,1578684893.0,Haha I know! It must be fate!
AskWomenOver30,fdri6by,t1_fdrho59,1578684858.0,I hope I get in that state soon. Right now I feel more sad and devastated that I will never have the chance to get to know him.
offmychest,fdrgqcj,t1_fdrgkfe,1578684282.0,"Ahh right, I forgot for a moment that I am not logged in on my proper account.   
Well, it is Robert Pattinson."
AskWomenOver30,fdrfsbn,t1_fdrfj0d,1578683934.0,"Is it as intense as I described it? I never had that before and I find myself totally foolish. I mean, I am constantly thinking of ways to meet him."
offmychest,fdrfl9s,t1_fdrf9hl,1578683828.0,"Hahaha, I am sorry, I can't tell you. I think if I reveal who it is you guys will find me even more foolish."
offmychest,fdrdsit,t3_emtutt,1578683051.0,My bf and I used to do that back in the beginning when we had a long distance relationship. We met on Chatroulette and it's been 8 years now.
