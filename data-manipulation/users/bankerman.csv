Keto_Food,fg7k5h0,t1_fg7000z,1580594476.0,"That’s not how it works, not even theoretically. Adding fiber doesn’t negate existing carbs. It adds a new carb, which you then subtract. So for a 50 carb milkshake, adding 50 grams of fiber doesn’t make the math 50 - 50 = 0 net carbs, it’s now 100 - 50 = 50 net carbs. To call it zero isn’t just “cheating,” it’s just not understanding the math. 

The only thing that really matters for weight loss purposes is that this bread is 40 calories per slice, which is a 43% reduction over your average 70 calorie slice or of white bread. Additionally, that extra fiber should cause you to feel much more full and satiated (at least in the near term) than normal bread, which is an added plus. The only question is whether the bread contains enough digestible carbs to trigger an insulin response in the body, which is really only relevant 1) if you’re strict keto for non-dietary reasons (diabetic, mental health benefits, etc.) or 2) if you’re worried an insulin response would cause hunger pangs that would lead you to subsequent overeating.
