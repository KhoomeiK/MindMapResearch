running,ffagu4o,t3_esgu4e,1579735423.0,"In 2018, my uncle passed away. He was only 46 and left behind my two cousins who are 10 and 11. He was in a horrible accident and at first we thought he was going to pull through. They had to amputate his leg but we thought he was going to make it through everything. Three days after they amputated his leg, he passed. 

Sometimes when I’m on a run and it starts getting tough and I want to stop, I think about my uncle. I think about how he got life taken from him so young. I keep on keeping on for him, since he doesn’t have the ability to do what I’m doing anymore. I think about him lots on my runs. I keep on running for you Uncle Serg. Miss you lots."

AskReddit,feli1al,t3_epp36x,1579222659.0,My hobby is running. I’d probably spend the $1500 on PT because it’s so goddamn expensive but I need healthy strong legs to be a better runner (and my legs are always aching unfortunately)

AskReddit,fehjm83,t3_ep3lzt,1579117882.0,"I never had reoccurring nightmares as a child but in 2018 my 46 yr old uncle passed away in a really tragic accident. Since then, every month or so I will dream that I'm going to his house to visit him, but when I walk in, it's just his casket and his body in the living room. I'm 25 now and it upsets me so much every time."

acne,febmty0,t3_eo1yw0,1578960537.0,"I was on spiro a few years ago. I don’t really remember how long it took to see results but it did help my skin and it was great. I just went back on it about two months ago because my skin is breaking out again. I also feel like my skin is getting worse...but I’m trying to hang in there. My derm said if I don’t see results at the end of the third month, she will bump me up to 100mg (I’m currently on 50mg). Good luck!!"

running,fdpc4tw,t3_emixk2,1578624924.0,"Something like this happened to me last week. I was running on a trail and a guy was walking toward me. As I started passing him, he started talking to me but I couldn’t hear him because I had my headphones in. I felt like a jerk but 1. I didn’t know the guy and there weren’t many other people I had seen on the trail and 2. I was in the groove of things and wasn’t going to stop my run for him. Sorry guy!"

SkincareAddiction,fdnepcd,t3_em3c8t,1578584216.0,"I have a question about spironolactone. I was on it for over a year and saw amazing results. Since my skin was doing so well, I decided to stop taking it. My skin remained clear for a few months, but two months ago I started breaking out again. I immediately started taking the spiro again but I'm still getting pimples. Do I need to give the spiro more time to work?"

AskReddit,fdhb5mu,t3_elcich,1578419228.0,"When my grandmother was alive, I always use to hang out with her. She was my best friend. When I had off from school or had a half day, I would go and spend time with her. The last time I saw her alive and healthy was Thanksgiving of 2012. I was on fall break and as I was leaving, she told me to come over and hang the following day since I had off from school. For some reason, I decided not to. The following week, she went in to the hospital unexpectedly and passed. I always wish I would have went over that Friday to hang out with her one more time."
