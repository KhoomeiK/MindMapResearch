There's some psychological evidence that this process is how we *always* make decisions. That is, we make a decision subconsciously beforehand, then we act it out, then our conscious mind justifies it using rationalization. If this process is short-circuited, you can get people to rationalize things they never actually decided. E.g. if you have them hold a ball with a numbed hand (using local anesthetic) and then sound a buzzer at the same time as you secretly stimulate their muscles to drop the ball, then ask them why they dropped the ball, they'll say something like, ""The buzzer surprised me."" In other words, our rational minds don't actually drive our actions directly, they simply explain our actions based on our understanding of the context."

You may get an ax with one-in-a-million stats, but who knows if next week a bow will drop with one-in-a-*billion*. Soft caps would make balancing easier, so that those with such rare equipment aren't too far ahead of the pack.

Games,ffu6ozj,t1_fft0dtf,1580235636.0,"Eh, the whole point of an RPG is that you, the player, doesn't *have* to ""git gud"". RPG players don't need to know how to swing a sword or cast a spell, because their characters do those things. Likewise, players don't really get more skillful as they play, other than perhaps becoming more familiar with the mechanics. Instead, loot and level progression represent the character's growth. That isn't a bad thing, it's just the way the genre works.

The other forces are much, MUCH stronger, but they tend to not reach very far. Especially important is the electromagnetic force, which is the one mostly responsible for molecules and crystals holding together, and therefore for the the shapes of things on the ""human"" scale. It's very strong, strong enough to hold steel or diamond together. But it only acts on things very close. So the bigger an object gets, the effect of electromagnetic forces stays abut the same, but the effect of gravity gets stronger and stronger. And that's why when things get big enough (roughly the size of a small moon), only gravity matters, so they all get pulled into spheroids."
