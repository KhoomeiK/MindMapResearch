Then I saw an episode where a gym trainer was overcharging Ian and Derek's characters for useless training sessions and Iwan convinced them to stop.
The trainer came by to convince them to resume and met Iwan's character.   Iwan's character started like that nice, sweet guy. But when he said,""they're nice people and nobody is going to take advantage of them on my watch""... he went full Ramsay Bolton.  
And he was scary.  Really really scary."

 She said that her therapist said maybe people like that aren't friends to begin with. I told her, 'maybe they have a different idea of the limits of friendship or how much they can handle themselves."" 

seemed to do the trick but I had to wait for the right moment."
