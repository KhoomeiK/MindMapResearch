CleetusMcFarland,fg7aq6q,t3_ex7tru,1580587983.0,"> Could build a huge shop on site for the channel to base out of

I assume this is the plan, why continue to rent a shop when you have land to put a shop on?

>Huge dedicated burnout pad

He already said that's what he's doing

> Regular (like weekly) events

That would take a lot of work, and they already have to do builds, attend other events, vlog, ship merch. They would have to hire staff to organize that kind of stuff, I'm not saying it's not possible, but I suspect that will be at least a few years down the road if ever, but from what he said, sounds like he's not interested in that side of things.

>Car shows

Yeah I could see that being a spot for that occasionally

> Events with stuff other than drag racing and burnouts

I could see small drifting events maybe, but what else would you do?

>Build a drag strip, maybe just one lane with a timer for testing n tuning, not sure how necessary this is with Bradenton next door but their relationship may change since they could be considered competitors

I really don't think they would bother building a strip. That's a lot of money for something that they could just go next door for. Plus with this place so close it opens up a lot of joint opportunities for events that neither could do alone. On top of that they don't have room for 1/4 mile strip, certainly not enough room to slow down once you hit the end.

> Build garage bays people could rent to work out of

Probably doesn't want the space to be open all the time, makes it really difficult to do anything if you want to keep it a secret

> Build a home on site? Imaging having a garage suite house where you can look out your window at the race track

The area probably isn't zoned for it, plus if work and home are very close sometimes going home doesn't feel like you do anything because work is always sitting there.

> Way more sponsorship opportunities to fund what's needed
 
Only if they start holding events, which might be on the horizon, but as stated earlier, probably isn't a priority

> Meetups other than cleetus & cars

Like I said before, events take a lot to organize and sounds like He's not really wanting to do it himself, or manage the people who would need to do it

> Technology integration: like tablets to buy tickets at the gate without talking to anyone, or on your phone by showing someone a QR code to enter, more digital boards, staging lanes with digital boards to show who's next

It's expensive and won't pay off that fast if you're not using it frequently. 

> 24/7 track livestream

Interesting idea, but then there's the privacy/secret project aspect, plus if they're holding events a lot of them have streaming rights to consider so those would likely have to be blacked out. 

> Can do things differently than every other track for the last 50 years

As someone who thinks the 08-14 models are the best looking of the group, this pains me physically.

Part of this will come down to what you want to do with the car, If you're looking for build a race car, then get the older one, the parts will be the same, and you won't be paying for things that you don't need. if you're looking for a daily driver, you should go newer, because the ride will be more refined, and the creature comforts will be better (BT audio, heated seats, etc.) If you want to do cosmetic upgrades, again, newer is better because as the cars get older, demand for parts specific to that model year become less in demand and places stop producing the. eg. I was looking at random carbon parts for my car just for fun and saw someone had carbon doors available, but when I went to Seibon's site (listed as the manufacturer) they didn't list the item. I suspect they have retired the mold and won't be producing more carbon doors for the 08-14 Impreza because nobody is buying them."
