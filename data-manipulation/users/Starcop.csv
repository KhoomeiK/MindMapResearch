changemyview,ffiredn,t1_ffiqx2b,1579980818.0,"All of the polls here where Biden has an unprecented lead are either pretty long ago or include the Bernie/Warren vote split. As of current Warren is becoming close to irrelevant, hence the current polls which have Biden and Bernie close to a tie. I really don't think youve shown a true 1v1 from the current times."
changemyview,ffiq3sb,t1_ffipknm,1579979913.0,"If you're going to pull the Racism card despite the internal dnc emails and obvious media rhetoric from 2016 than I have no confidence you're making an argument in good faith. I won't be continuing. My current point is that in general polls it's extremely close. When it does actually come down to a 1v1 I'm sure the information gap will be far less than before, not that I can find these supposed 1v1 polls."
changemyview,ffip8g1,t1_ffioix1,1579979301.0,"I feel as though that analysis is pretty flawed. Hillary won purely on media blackout for everyone else. Hillary was so unpopular that Trump himself was able to win, if anything I'd say unironic Hillary supporters are in the minority as of current. I'm also looking at polls in general for democrat voters and it currently looks like it's a close race between Biden and Sanders while it's still early."
changemyview,ffindc3,t1_ffilpma,1579978027.0,"The same type of people who'd vote for Hillary are those who'd vote for the Democrats no matter what. I don't necessarily know any statistics about Hillary voter turnover but currently Bernie is more popular than he ever was this early, enough to get very close or winning polls against Biden. Ultimately the trend seems to show him on the rise and Biden on the drop"

fatlogic,fezxa87,t1_fezhe5y,1579462882.0,"That's what I started doing. Ive lost fifty pounds so far but it's still hard to fully manage to day to day. I've decided on undershooting my calories so even a small overage still ends up being enough for me to lose weight.

I'll always end up eating 0-250 cal extra over the limit. But my limit isn't changed by exercise."
fatlogic,fez7rhi,t1_fey0ea8,1579454565.0,"Trust me, it's very easy to end up in this situation. I use the app lifesum and sometimes when you just look up something like ""sausage"" it'll give you options with like half the actual calories. I try and barcode scan everything I can and estimate as little as possible.

Hell, the whole fact that a lot of people don't have a good idea if what a tablespoon is or a cup probably adds to it all. They take an actual mug of something which is more like two cups and report it as one.

Also, a lot of dieting apps overestimate calorie burn from exercise. Lifesum for me doubles whatever Google fit says."
