- Enforce a rule with yourself about snacking. Say, you‚Äôre allowed one pre-planned snack after lunch, or no snacks between meals, etc.  Whatever works for you.

- Anytime you feel like snacking go for a walk. It doesn‚Äôt need to be anything outside or away for long. Try just getting up to use the bathroom, check your mailbox, or get a refill on water. Do it once an hour to keep from sitting too long. Use your lunch time to take a longer walk and the eat at your desk later. 

- Start getting proactive with your career. The more responsibility you have in the day, the more work you have (usually) = less available time for snacking. Bonus in that it may lead to a promotion or better job down the road since you‚Äôre building your resume"

fatlogic,fefawbd,t1_feem6wf,1579052277.0,"Because even though everyone agrees that breast milk is better than formula, not all moms have the option or ability to EBF. I‚Äôm glad breastfeeding is getting more attention and focus when for years it wasn‚Äôt, but there‚Äôs a pretty strong backlash/judgement happening now with moms who think breastfeeding makes them superior. 

I already laid my story out in another comment on this thread, but to add to it- you will never understand as someone who was lucky enough to be able to EBF the heartbreaking failure when no matter what you do, your body fails and you have to give up feeding your child that way. You will never feel the silent judgement of strangers who see you pull out the formula supplies when with your hungry infant, the eye contact and minute shakes of their heads when they make all kinds of assumptions about your parenting based on your choice to FEED YOUR CHILD.

I don‚Äôt know if you intend to come across that way, but your wording above indicates you hold some judgement about moms who don‚Äôt EBF. I didn‚Äôt choose to go formula out of ignorance or because I didn‚Äôt care about my babies‚Äô health. I did it because my body failed and they were hungry. I will have to carry that failure for the rest of my life, even though logically I know it does not matter when they are now thriving. It‚Äôs the knowledge that at its most basic level my body does not do what it‚Äôs genetically designed for.

That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre getting downvoted."

I sobbed in the hospital when the lactation consultant handed me a bottle and gave me permission to not listen to my first cry from hunger.

Sex addicts manipulate the people around them to get off, risk STDs, etc., Over-exercising is an addiction that FAs make light of to push their agenda. People are addicted to games and technology- see Japan‚Äôs birth rate crisis for more info on that."

I started loan processing for a bank because no teaching jobs were panning out besides subbing and student loans don‚Äôt pay themselves. I‚Äôve since moved on/up and now do document reviews for high value loans on business equipment, which is a fancy way of saying I‚Äôm a paper pusher with the ability to wire money. But now I have two kids to feed and house and I carry our family benefits, so I‚Äôm overall pretty content with it.

My advice- have a big water bottle in class. Don‚Äôt guzzle as bathroom breaks will be limited, but it gives you something to hold and sip if needed. It‚Äôs also helpful to remember it‚Äôs not fair to eat in front of your students when a lot of schools restrict what they can eat and where outside of the lunch room. 

Also, restrain the urge to stress drink after school. A lot of teachers fall into alcoholism because it‚Äôs easy to drink while grading and such."

I can commiserate. I had the first girl in 50 years on my husbands side. His mom was the last one and she wanted a daughter. She went a little nuts right after DDs birth out of excitement (we didn‚Äôt know the gender going in), but mellowed out over time and with consistency between DH and I.

I‚Äôm looking forward to it as it‚Äôs some of my favorites in town (mexican today), and it‚Äôs the only day I get to indulge in it since I‚Äôve been working at home. 

Since walking in the door I‚Äôve been offered:
- leftover pizza from yesterday‚Äôs lunch
- boozy fruitcake, which I tried because I‚Äôve always wanted to
- copious amounts of candy
- Cookies 

I tried my cake, ate my yogurt, and got my fancy coffee that I planned on today. I saved a little candy to bring home, so this far I‚Äôm on track. But it‚Äôs 10am and lunch isn‚Äôt even here yet.

I will say that child is old enough to be taught nutrition basics- you have to tailor it to the developmental age you‚Äôre working with. A 2 year old knows no reasoning, so you give them healthy foods and an occasional treat. An 11 year old can understand their dietary choices have consequences"
fatlogic,fck56lp,t1_fck47cn,1577716912.0,In general it‚Äôs not a good idea to put kids on diets unless it‚Äôs emergent and medically supervised. Studies have shown it‚Äôs been better to establish better eating habits as a family and let nature/next growth spurt take its course.
