alcoholism,ffdpynq,t1_ffdnwgy,1579826167.0,"Sure I'm on my phone right now so I'll be more brief than I'd like to be but basically stoicism is a system of ancient philosophy developed by the Romans that focuses on controlling your emotional responses to negative stimulus - whether that's a negative thought, a negative emotion, a negative craving, etc etc. The most famous stoic philosopher was Marcus Aurelius, often considered the last great Roman emperor. He was a literal philosopher king, and a great man. He wrote a book called meditations which is now part of the stoic Canon. 

I'm still a novice myself and im still learning about it, so this is a very condensed summary. There are a number of practices and ""thought tools"" that stoics use to help control their emotional responses. Modern CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) is thought to have many parallels to stoic practices. It's my belief ( and the belief of many others) that stoic philosophy and practice can be useful for treating depression, addiction, or any other negative and disordered behaviors (obviously barring severe mental illness like schizophrenia or something like that)."

Camus, like many existentialists, starts from a place of nihilism. Saying the universe doesn't matter, that nothing matters, is nihilism. Im sure the poster was trying to be helpful, but convincing someone that literally everything is meaningless is just as likely to get them to commit suicide as it is to convince them to embrace the existential attitude.

His core messages on psychology, meaning and purpose are pretty apolitical but I don't think those are what people take issue with. People take issue with the eccentric and bizzaro things he says and does outside of that core message. Like advocating for an all meat diet. Like saying climate change isn't really an issue. Like aligning himself further and further with the political right, when his own politics are left of center (he's pro wealth redistribution and pro universal healthcare). It's all just really, really weird."

Speak for yourself chump. I hate when nihilists try passing off their shit as absolute fact. Your life matters. Love matters. Suffering matters. Art matters. Music matters. Beauty matters. Right here and now matters. 

This narrow world view relies on some sort of God or deity to assign meaning to everyone else. Which is just so absurd. No God doesn't mean that there's no meaning in life. The meaning is there for us to find. You may find that life is meaningless but it's absolutely cancerous to try and spread that notion to everyone else."

I have a hard time imagining that you're actually trying to make this argument in good faith. You think that learning and honing **martial arts skills** has *nothing* to do with being able to defend yourself on the street? You ACTUALLY think that's a solid point? 

Here's a former UFC fighter KO'ing a 300 pound lineman on the street

I could go on and on with these dude. Don't expect to be taken seriously when saying things like ""learning martial arts doesn't help with self defense"". Take a step back and realize how silly that sounds.

As for the hypothetical match up - I wasn't asking you which fighter you would prefer to fight. I was asking you which one would win in a matchup against each other. You can be as ""ruthless"" as you want, but if you lack the athleticism and martial arts skill you can't win a fight. Youtube is absolutely FULL of videos of overconfident and ""ruthless"" thugs and gangsters getting KTFO by people that know what they're doing. 

I would go so far as to say that the opposite of what you posited, is actually true. The more ""ruthless"" someone is, they less likely they are to have trained in martial arts, and the more ineffective they will be in a fight. On the other hand, the people that train in martial arts are more likely to be passive, tolerant, patient and non-combative aka not very ""ruthless"". 

Sorry to go in on you dude. Martial arts is a passion of mine and I had to pull your ticket with what felt like a very ""bro philosophy"" take on the subject. Being ""ruthless"" won't win you fights - knowing how to fight and the physical ability to operationalize that knowledge wins you fights. 

You might wanna check out of that McDojo you've been training at and enroll in your nearest MMA gym that offers wrestling and boxing classes."
vegancirclejerk,fdkwyrb,t1_fdjlvbe,1578512875.0,"Lol that's an interesting take. 

Who would you pick in this hypothetical match up?

Both combatants are the same age and around the same weight. 

Combatant A: highly skilled in martial arts + highly athletic + not very ""ruthless"" 

Combatant B: not very skilled in martial arts + not very athletic + VERY ""ruthless""

I'm glad youve taken an interest in martial arts but your kickboxing classes don't uniquely qualify your opinion on the matter. Fighting is primarily about fighting prowess (skill) and secondarily about athleticism. 

You can be the most ""ruthless"" bloodthirsty unhinged 130 pound meth head on the planet but if you run into a kind hearted, soft spoken 130 pound wrestler with some boxing training and initiate a fight, you're gonna get laid the fuck out."
