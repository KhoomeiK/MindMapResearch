ChronicPain,fem3j3h,t3_epkkt8,1579238558.0,"I work in the medical field and while I don't have too much advice, I definitely have some information that might help clear some things up.  Everytime someone is prescribed any sort of opioid or narcotic, it goes into a database that can get pulled up by doctors all around the country.  What was given, the dosage, the date of the prescription, etc.  If a patient is given a certain amount of medications, they will be flagged in the system and every doctor who prescribes from there on out could potentially be sued and lose their license for over prescribing.  I'm sorry you're going through this, but also keep in mind that I'm sure they're doing what they can.

Additionally, I saw in a previous post that you suffer from absence seizures.  Seizures can often be exacerbated by oxy, so please be careful."
