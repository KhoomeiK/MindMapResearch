apexlegends,fflape5,t1_ffl9x6y,1580037205.0,"I get you, totally. I've been playing since day one but for me, I don't even want anything lol. I enjoy games the way they are and I'd be happy if Apex stayed as it was during day one right now. I'm still happy about how far they've come and I agree with you that players get 'tired' of the same thing. I, myself, am a solo queuer and usually almost play with randoms (except for the times that I play with 1-2 other people I've met and befriended over the year online). I remember I barely played solo because I hated it, personally. I never liked playing Apex alone, it almost feels impossible for me. Even having another teammate makes everything 100 times better. I wouldn't mind if they made solos or duos permanent. But yea, even squads would be nicer. Trios get hard and frustrating (especially with the current state of SBMM right now). Oh well, I'm just happy it exists and I'll probably never quit despite how angry I get when I play sometimes. It's just became an addiction for me, like no other game."

ApplyingToCollege,ffl9c9y,t1_ffk7rk3,1580036714.0,"Eh, I'm required to do math but most of my coding at most has been incrementing a loop by 1. There are things which you need math for, things like Induction, Recurrence Relations, etc. However, these are just necessary for the degree, at least where I go to Uni. Of course, you should understand the math behind it. For instance, solving problems using recursion is kind of mathy. Factorials using recursion for example, of course, you can write it iteratively, but using recursion requires just a *tad* bit more math. Overall, you can definitely still major in CS but would need to focus on math a little bit more."
