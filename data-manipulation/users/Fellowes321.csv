No matter what it is, the question is whether it is beneficial to the country to have so many graduates, It clearly isn't. All that has happened is that the graduate premium has fallen and jobs that do not require higher qualification are being filled by graduates. This is not a good use of money. Even the Open University is a shadow of its former self and provides less for a much higher cost.
Through the EU we brought in builders and plumbers and other trades people because we have a shortage of skilled workers. FE colleges which could provide these trades are poorly funded and the lecturers there poorly paid and supported. The UK suffers from a surplus of academic and a deficit of non-academic talent. Snobbery about ""the trades"" is common.
Graduates are not providing value for the country not because there's not enough but because there's too many. 
University education can be afforded (the cost per student tuition is little more per year than a year in secondary school) but there is no political will. Ministers believe they themselves are paragons and that their lives are perfect models. As a result university education is valued above others. 
Even then there is a hierarchy of science above arts and even within the arts, music is above dance. Being able to write about poetry or art or a play is valued higher than the ability to actually write poetry or a play or to paint."
politics,feq7vcu,t1_feoqqhq,1579338610.0,"Student loans are new. They started in the 1990s. Since then, the size of the required loan has risen enormously. What was once some help with living costs, is now a loan to cover all costs and tuition. The first loans were a few hundred pounds. Graduates now leave with over £50,000 of debt.
The loan scheme was set up to be cost neutral as debt was index linked. This was changed and is now index linked+2%. The thresholds for repayment have changed, debt can now be automatically removed from salary. These changes occurred in just the first twenty years. Any graduate who thinks the loan will be unchanged is an optimist.
Even if it is forgiven, the repayments are such that any financial gain to be made from a graduate salary will be wiped out by repayments. At the same time pensions have taken a hit (pay more, get less, work longer to get it), house prices remain very high as do rents. It's not a surprise that people end up back with their parents through their twenties or thirties."

It's the same in the UK. My kids will be encouraged to go into careers that do not require a degree. Financially, there's few jobs where you'll make your money back. 

On average plumbers will earn more than the physics graduate (although science salaries are higher in the US than the UK). Tube drivers earn more than headteachers of primary schools. In the UK becoming a schoolteacher - requiring a first degree followed by a postgraduate teaching certificate is a financial mistake. I teach but was fortunate to graduate before the introduction of tuition fees.
