vaporents,feb9ny6,t1_feavx6d,1578956650.0,It's intense. The vaporizer equivalent of a fat blunt or something.
vaporents,fe3rr20,t1_fdzltrc,1578852211.0,"Do not overpack it. Small, thin flame, pointed directly at the pointy middle of the underside of the bowl. 

Make sure your count is steady, and always count the seconds.

4 sec heat - 4 sec pause - 4 sec heat - 4 sec pause -  2 sec heat

Slow and steady pull.

This is my technique for high temp clouds.

As it retains a fair amount of heat, you might want to heat less the next heat cycle.

I usually finish a VM bowl in two big rips, with one heating cycle per rip.

Love this vape so much.

E: Sry, meant to reply to OP, but am 7/10 rn sooo"

GetMotivated,fdv7rea,t1_fdsx8ij,1578744344.0,"Good question.

I never purchased rela luxury goods, but I ate out at fancy places and bought more expensive clothes than I needed (imagine and Osprey backpack, not a Gucci Bag), and luved quite a lavish life style under the radar."

GetMotivated,fdq9pfz,t1_fdq60db,1578660423.0,"Same. I Just switched out my six year old iPhone due to battery issues, and needing a newer phone for work.

People way under me on the corporate ladder have the most expensive shit they really can't afford. I _know_ cos I pay them.

I enjoy looking at an expensive watch for three years, reading all about it, then maaaaybe but it. 


As a former poor kid, just knowing that Cartier _could_ be mine is very satisfying."
Drugs,fdjr9p1,t3_elfrxj,1578484495.0,"Idk man, more than 20 years of heavy use (the last ten ish only dry herb vapes, edibles and the odd dab), never had any withdrawal, even after CT.

Opiate withdrawal is pretty shit, benzo withdrawals are the absolute worst torture I've been though. 

Maybe we should start using a more nuanced language when it comes to addiction, but it's still important to let people know that cannabis is non addictive for _most_ people.

I've never known a cannabis ""addict"" who wasn't mainly a poly drug addict.

Edit: oh btw my memory is good, and I'm mentally and physically fit. I think alot of people who smoke a lot of weed are not leading healthy lifestyles."
