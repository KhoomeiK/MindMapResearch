dogs,ff3rysa,t3_erhnm7,1579547565.0,"Crate train- I used it to enforce naps, to help housetraining, and for the days where I just needed fifteen minutes to relax without pulling my hair out. My dog chooses to hang out in there now and I don't need to ever lock it."
Dogtraining,ff3riad,t3_er9bo6,1579547286.0,"We foster dogs and by far the most difficult thing to do is stay consistent with structure and routine but it's by far the most important. That's what gives the dog the confidence to know what's appropriate and how to act. Any dog needs lots of structure and boundaries, especially when going through so many changes. He won't naturally know what's appropriate in your home so you have to teach him that! Dogs take about two weeks to truly settle in and even then some take longer. If he's guarding, no couch and no bed. Give him a designated space for himself- a crate, a dog bed, etc. Enforce general manners too, i.e. ""sit"" before getting food/treats, and as hard as it is, don't excuse undesirable behavior or coddle him. Yes, give him lots of love and affection but dogs need structure to thrive, so make him ""earn"" it. You're not necessarily going to be able to do a ton of training in the first weeks as he's adjusting but in my opinion, manners should always be enforced and they help set the foundation  for good behavior!"
dogs,feu52ja,t1_ferrd3r,1579383186.0,"I second this! Nature walks are amazing, especially for anxious dogs!"
puppy101,feu1zec,t3_eqje9q,1579382333.0,"I foster and have housetrained a bunch of pups. I think about it in two halves! The dog needs to understand mentally that it needs to potty outside and physically we need to help train their bodies to hold it. Usually these two things don't happen simultaneously, one catches on a little before the other!

For me, I find that the crate is super helpful for both. A dog naturally won't want to potty where they sleep and it helps us provide the structure to build up their bladder control. If your pup can reliably be in the crate for an hour and will then pee outside, try adding another 15 minutes. 

Obviously, a puppy's entire day can't be spent in the crate. Lots of pups will need to go out right after waking up, eating or drinking, and after a play session. Those times are the ones that, for me, are always toughest to catch. It usually means that they just don't have the bladder control yet, not necessarily that they don't understand that outside is the appropriate place. Your puppy is young still, stay vigilant and she'll catch on!"
Dogtraining,feu0abh,t3_eqiaif,1579381833.0,"My dog isn't a fan of harnesses because they never fit his body type- he's super tall and skinny and after four different types I gave up, they all rub under his arms or are just way too big. I understand why you want one but there's a chance it'd still be uncomfortable for him on runs. Are you using a flat collar? A martingale may be better for runs,  you can adjust it a little looser without the fear of him slipping it. 

As for jackets, my dog will pull anything off that's not cut like a shirt. If there's straps or velcro he will find a way to get it off. Have you tried something that slips on? You mentioned that he's cut short, if he really hates coats could you potentially just leave it longer for warmth?

In my opinion, you can train your dog to be comfortable with a harness and a coat, it's just a matter of whether or not you're willing to put in the time to do it. Some dogs just arent comfortable!"
puppy101,fe934gy,t1_fe91au9,1578933721.0,Agreed! It's just so easy to assume SA but that's more of a behavioral issue than a training one. A lots of times it's just crate anxiety. Obviously it's still possible but it's usually much more severe than what people describe
puppy101,fe8x4bx,t3_eo2imx,1578931979.0,"You've gotten some good advice so I wont repeat it but in relation to separation anxiety:

1. SA is different than crate anxiety, it's important to identify which one it is. As humans we like to assume our pups miss us a ton and sometimes self-diagnose SA when it's actually just crate anxiety (which is much easier to train)

2. Whining is not the only symptom of SA, destruction is as well. Some pups will bite at the bars, dig at the tray, and destroy toys

3. Separation anxiety is lots of times treated with medication whereas crate anxiety is trainable

I wanted to note the difference because they require different approaches!"
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fe03mqt,t3_en9ndk,1578802237.0,Thank you for fostering <3 it's tough to give them up but it's so worth it
EngagementRings,fdw6qn8,t3_en7p3w,1578755638.0,"I think it'd depend on how much weight loss it is for him, in terms of percentage. Someone who is 250 losing 25 lbs probably wouldn't change but if he's starting at 150 it could."
IDmydog,fdvpg2o,t3_en6rl6,1578750062.0,Something about the body shape and narrow head is reminding me a bit of a greyhound
Dogtraining,fdviy1n,t1_fdv67y4,1578747930.0,"Agree with all of this! I'd add treats into this training-  for every interaction, add a treat. It will help the positive association.  Once your pup is comfortable you can back off the treats."
puppy101,fdp98x0,t3_emhs8u,1578622979.0,I've personally used Purina Pro Plan for my resident dogs and fosters and all of them have done well. There are lots of different varieties to choose from within the brand as well.
puppy101,fdp8ijg,t3_emj66x,1578622489.0,Machinery and dark empty spaces. Lol.
puppy101,fdm2ulc,t1_fdm2scs,1578538485.0,My dog has three and it's still not enough lol hopefully your pup likes them too!
puppy101,fdm2ij8,t1_fdm284g,1578538257.0,I've never personally used those. You dont want him to be able to break pieces off and it needs to be big enough so it's not a choking hazard! A lot of puppy chews are very malleable and it's easy for stronger chewers (even puppies) to destroy them. I've used nylabones before (I think they make the fake antlers) but my pup just didnt like them as much as the other two I mentioned.
puppy101,fdm25il,t3_em375c,1578538014.0,I use antlers and benebones. Make sure they're size appropriate and always supervise chewing
puppy101,fdf7yju,t1_fdf7u4y,1578355400.0,"I would do LOTS of socialization in a carrier- subways, everything. You can also have playdates with other fully vaccinated, healthy dogs! I would just do them in someone's home rather than on the street or in a park"
puppy101,fdf6yzv,t1_fdf6tkn,1578354742.0,Ahh! Well I've taken our fosters out in bags/carriers before as socialization! Just knowing our neighborhood I'd hesitate to let a pup walk freely without all of their shots
puppy101,fdf6h75,t1_fdf2uus,1578354411.0,I don't necessarily agree with this- in suburbs I wouldn't worry but I have at least 50 dogs who live on my street in NYC and I wouldn't risk it. I'd default to the vet's recommendation
puppy101,fdf6a8i,t3_el1vwu,1578354283.0,Do you cut off water at night? We usually pick up the bowl at 8:30 so our fosters sleep through the night

puppy101,fdf4zn4,t1_fdf4v7u,1578353435.0,The good news is that she's young! It'll be much easier to address now rather than later
puppy101,fdf2kr5,t3_el1ckb,1578351865.0,"I wouldn't give them to her unless you're training along with it. Resource guarding can be come very serious very quickly and you should be addressing it ASAP. There are also different levels of guarding, scaling from growling to biting. It sounds like she's already put teeth on you so I'd start serious training now. Lots of people have success with trading for a higher value treat in addition to the ""drop it/leave it"" command the other commenter mentioned. 

Some general boundaries that I use with food: sit before recieving, building up to a ""wait"" until a release command. Also, if she inhales her food I'd break it up into smaller meals and make her ""earn"" it each time with the ""sit"" and ""wait"". That will help her understand that you control the food and that she has to have some impulse control. These things are difficult with puppies so young but it will help build the foundation! For the record, I'd also practice with toys in addition to food, treats, and chews. I've also seen dogs guard couches and beds, just as a watch out! Dogs can guard anything they deem valuable, it could even be a stick or a rock. I'd do some research into it so you can familiarize yourself with what it looks like."
dogs,fdcv8iy,t1_fdcv4cc,1578285277.0,Your comment made me tired! You're amazing
dogs,fdct0fa,t1_fdcsw6w,1578283477.0,"Preach! Two humans, two cats, a resident dog and large dog fosters in a small one bedroom in NYC. I will never have enough"
dogs,fdcr0ax,t3_ekmeec,1578281887.0,"I work with a rescue on the foster team! I'll give my two cents:

1. Your first is always the hardest to give up. Lots of people will overlook the ""negatives"" or reasons why the dog may not be the perfect one for you because you fall in love so quickly. You are not the only one who can love the dog, there are lots of good homes!

2. OBJECTIVELY look at the dog you're fostering. Is he actually everything you've ever wanted? Or is it just hard to give him up because he's cute and now you love him?

3. Are you in the right place in your life to adopt? Are you ready for a 16 year commitment? What about financials? Don't pressure yourself into committing if you're not truly ready

4. Why did you choose to foster? Was it to find your perfect dog or was it because you weren't ready for the commitment? Revisiting why you decided to foster instead of adopt may help you. 

TONS of fosters adopt their foster animals. It's not really a ""fail""! You get to see the dog and all his quirks before you officially adopt him, it's super helpful. But since I foster myself and guide other fosters, I wanted to share the points I made above. A lot of people are willing to overlook a lot that they normally wouldn't because they feel that sense of attachment. Just make sure you're truly ready!"
puppy101,fdat7m1,t3_eke0ge,1578249812.0,I'd start now. You dont necessarily need to use any toothpaste but I'd start getting him used to the process!

IDmydog,fd6fa4v,t3_ek3cea,1578190098.0,I would guess aussie/rottie. Her snout is wide like a rottie's
dogs,fd2grw0,t3_ejw67j,1578146995.0,There are lots of kinds of skin issues and if it's on her paw it could even be from a plant. I'd get a vet's opinion to be safe. You can also post in r/askvet for a more informed opinion

puppy101,fd1yfxe,t3_ejtdrs,1578138780.0,"It's always a good idea to get a trainer when working through a behavior issue. They'll be able to better understand why your pup is acting the way it is and can figure out the best way to address it. I'd do some research into positive only trainers vs balanced trainers. Their philosophies are different.

As an anecdote, my dog became fearful of a lot of things at about the same age. It's pretty normal, at that age dogs go through a second fear phase. My dog became reactive (which he never showed any signs of) and was terrified of my car. I did not get a trainer but while the reactivity is no longer an issue, he still hates the car."
puppy101,fcztbt6,t3_ejqqty,1578108256.0,I would follow your vet's recommendation. You can also put your pup in a carrier and go places for socialization. It's worth noting that your pup can still meet fully vaccinated dogs in a controlled environment (i.e. not in a dog park or in super populated places).
puppy101,fczszg1,t3_ejqk4j,1578108094.0,"I wouldn't think too much into it, lots of dogs will hump out of excitement. I would correct it with ""off"" or ""leave it"" or whatever you use to cease behavior"
dogs,fczluat,t3_ejl1e5,1578104049.0,"There is NOTHING better than getting a compliment on behalf of your pup! My personal favorite is ""Where'd you have him trained??"" I DID THAT!

puppy101,fcrkw02,t3_eiku2r,1577903146.0,"I took my pup to the park 5 times a week at 5 months. He was super high energy, loved other dogs, and needed to learn how to play appropriately (he was very rough). I definitely got to a point where he was over-exercised and to be honest, I had no idea it was possible. If your pup is enjoying it and doesn't seem to spend an excess amount of time sleeping, I wouldn't worry much! 

You can always ask your vet at your next appointment if there's a limit you should place but as long as the pup is free to run and break on his own you should be ok!"
puppy101,fck7z9l,t3_ehluhf,1577719097.0,"I personally am a huge fan of crate training. It helps with houstraining, dogs have a sense of security, and is a physically safe place for them while unsupervised. I foster and have a resident dog and two cats.  My resident dog is two and I no longer NEED to crate him but we still reinforce the training every now and then. I will note that I keep a baby gate up at all times so my cats can have a safe place away from him- I will forever have a place my cats can escape to regardless of how much I trust my dog.

With my fosters, I've seen every sort of anxiety when it comes to the crate and being left alone. I've seen fosters shred doors when kept in a room instead of a crate, injest socks, and shred beds. I've also seen dogs bend bars of crates when left alone. I still feel that the crate is the safest place for a young dog when left alone, even if they grow out of it as most dogs do.

In terms of leaving your dog alone when you're at work, can you arrange for a walker? Or maybe daycare? Crating for the day isn't as intense as it sounds if your pup gets a walk and has chews and whatnot to keep her occupied. If you do make the decision to crate train, I have some tips I can post to help!

Good luck!"
AskReddit,fcjylz0,t3_ehg5ac,1577710683.0,"Way late to the party but I have one:

My mom is overprotective- it's just her thing, she overreacts to a lot. But there was one time when I was about 5 when someone knocks on our door right after she got out of the shower. It was just the two of us and when she got to the door she found some guy holding her mail. He was very obviously not our mailman and in my mom's normal fashion, she reacted VERY strongly. She says ""what the hell are you doing?"" And when his answer was literally ""giving you your mail"" she lost her shit and screamed at him, telling him to get off her property blah blah blah. During this whole thing there was another man standing on the corner which she didn't realize until she started yelling. 

Two weeks later their pictures were in the paper for multiple home invasions, using the mail as a ruse."

puppy101,fcgcv49,t3_eh6h2a,1577638725.0,"I use baby gates and I love them. I have a small apt so a crate plus a pay pen takes up a lot of space but baby gates have worked really well. I also swear by a lick mat- you can get the one with suction cups on amazon for like $15. It is one of the most versatile things I own- I use it for bath times, nail clipping, grooming, and even crate training. Definitely an under-the-radar tool but I love it. I also got a reusable pee pad (which sounds disgusting I know) but I use it as a liner for the crate! If the pup spills water or has an accident, it's easier to clean than a bed or a blanket.

Good luck, and congrats!"

In terms of suggestions, have you worked with a trainer in regards to his social skills? Some dogs will naturally be more social than others but any anxiety or reactivity can improve with training. Also, I know a number of people who have muzzle trained their dogs so they can safely experience social situations and work on improving- maybe this is something you can work on? Also, there are lots of groups you can join that revolve around dogs, from meet ups to volunteering. Maybe you could try some of those? I have friends from a rescue that will come over and it's never an issue if my dog jumps or barks or whatever- they understand that we're working on it and respond appropriately. Good luck!"
