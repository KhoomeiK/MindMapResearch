BirdsBeingDicks,ff5k3ib,t1_ff33i9n,1579596650.0,because it’s the mother training them. You can see at some points in the video the youngsters opening the beak and flapping the wings (the normal youngsters “feed me” call). They are used to be feed right at their throats and now they need to learn to use their beaks to get their own food
vivaldibrowser,ff3xpfc,t1_ff2qgyr,1579551133.0,"I did, but it uses more resources than Chrome or Brave doing the same tasks (I sent a post to this subreddit about it)"
vivaldibrowser,ff2mm4v,t1_ff0euo9,1579513489.0,It is. I was about to try it again because I had good feelings the last time I tried it like a couple of years ago and I wanted to give it another try but fortunately I found your post. I wish there’s still a way to spit out the toxic group and still continue the project back to its roots

Awwducational,ff2mdhf,t1_ff2ag26,1579513117.0,"Standing beside an almost blind animal stress them? You should get out more into wild nature and see how animals try to eat each other everyday.
The person filming this video didn’t even move the foot when the mother came closer, so there’s no stress at all there."

Their stocks are falling down and in that link there's a ton of other links to financial sites pointing out a ton of lawyer firms are starting investigations about fraud against Opera Limited."
operabrowser,fet04qx,t3_eq54zg,1579370581.0,That article is simply incredible! Jaw dropping and astonishing. Shame on you Opera team for selling your soul to that Chinese crazy CEO. Transforming a nice interesting project into a scam company. What a pity
vivaldibrowser,feszbq9,t3_eq6bw2,1579370417.0,That report is astonishing :o. The Chinese new owner is simply taking all the money and investing in crazy or doubtful businesses. Jaw dropping report
operabrowser,fekvy6d,t1_fegiltu,1579208719.0,"Vivaldi uses twice the resources Chrome needs to do things like playing a video (I reported it to them). It's actually funny, I'm tired of Vivaldi and reading opinions from Opera users to see if they are happy with it"
entertainment,fefz6r0,t1_fefddst,1579070258.0,It was like watching a Tarantino movie about Stars Wars. I loved it :D
vivaldibrowser,fdy726k,t1_fduoljb,1578776774.0,"That was my suspect too. I learnt too that they use alternative codecs from some kinds of media and that seems to be another factor. It's a real pity, because they have the best UI to me, but it's too slow and unnecessarily intensive that I can't use it. I'm trying now Firefox again and it seems to fly these days.

Opera was something I used a while ago and I was happy with it but the Chinese stakeholders that joined them scared me a lot about the privacy of the app. I agree, they are doing a great work with the software, but China is just too scary to trust it.

vivaldibrowser,fdkrdth,t1_fdjuvvc,1578509567.0,That's simply not true. It uses more RAM but reduces CPU usage as it blocks ad scripts. But I will say it again: I tried also in incognito window and the problem is there too.
vivaldibrowser,fdjsv4o,t1_fdjge3m,1578486290.0,"That's very interesting to know. I noticed while playing music using Plex using Vivaldi that having the tab in background while opening other webs, the audio stutters quite often too. Are also the audio codecs different than those from Google?"
vivaldibrowser,fdjsq7e,t1_fdjgbi6,1578486146.0,"That's interesting, I didn't notice that. No, I didn't change any settings from Youtube or from chrome:settings or things like that, both have a default setup with just some addons."
vivaldibrowser,fdjsn2z,t1_fdjg6us,1578486050.0,"I did it fast before going to bed and I didn't let the video run for enough time to see better the temp and usage difference. I'll try later today to do a more ""scientific"" comparison with just one tab opened on each and let them run for a while to show better graphs.

Thank you for the answer and the tips"
vivaldibrowser,fdjes51,t1_fdj2p4p,1578467767.0,"HW Acceleration is enabled in both of them. It was my first thought and I checked it in both and it's enabled. I suspect more it's coming from the ""custom layer"" Vivaldi uses, maybe the thumbnails for tabs or some background process. I wanted to comment the issue because maybe it's just a bug that can be traced and fixed and make Vivaldi the best thing on Earth ;)"
vivaldibrowser,fdjelwh,t1_fdicvcj,1578467566.0,"Thanks, but I use exactly the same extensions in both but just one: uBlock, because Brave includes its own adblocker. I've tried disabling them or using incognito windows to test and the results are the same :("
vivaldibrowser,fdic7db,t3_eljj0a,1578439620.0,It would be great if somebody has any clue or there's any option I can deactivate in the settings to reduce CPU usage. Any help will be welcome :)
