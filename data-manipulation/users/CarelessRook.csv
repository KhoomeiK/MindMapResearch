Just getting out of bed in the morning and resigning myself to the day is already a fucking nightmare, I dont have the willpower to even attempt to do something like this, every time I even think about going to the gym I just end up feeling bad because I never end up going and it ruins my day.

The entire process of even motivating myself to exercise is awful, and I hate it. I havent given it a ""fair chance"" because I don't feel capable of doing so and never have unless some kind of outside force was pushing me to, and even then I didn't enjoy it.

I dont get it
Every single response boils down to ""Just do it anyway and you'll like it"" you aren't giving a perspective you're telling me I'm doing it wrong and not allowed to have mine.
 
This ""bad mindset"" didnt just apperate out of nowhere and I cant just go ""Ah you're right silly me"" and traipse down to the gym and suddenly nut all over the weight equipment. Even if I did go there i'f have to keep coming back over and over and over regularly according to you and I dont see that conceivably happening.

Im not capable of understanding you, I'm not a person who's designed to accomplish these things, life as a lazy piece of shit who does nothing is already hard enough, and adding more regular pain to it doesnt make ansy kind of sense to me."
AskMen,feeixcf,t1_feei5oj,1579034679.0,"I dont care if i've given it a fair chance or not. I dont wanna do it and I hate it. I have no incentive to want to like it ij yhe same way as doing math or vaccuming my house.

This is also part of why i never wanna go to the gym. I hate the way people wont allow you to dislike exercise.

I just dont see myself getting into the same mindset with exercise. I played a ton of sports as a kid but hated all of them and as soon as I got old enough, and lifting weights or running hold no appeal to me either.

I just, don't get it."
AskMen,feebiwj,t1_feeazrb,1579030358.0,"The differrnce is that videogames are fun.

They're designed to be fun to play and engaging and there's a sense of something actually happening whenever you play them.
With exercise you spend an hour feeling like shit and then the only thing thats supposed to keep you going is ""well eventually in a month or so I'll probably maybe be stronger or feel better""
Its so nebulous ans frustrating and everybody telling you that it's supposed to feel great doesnt help at all.

The scientific benefits may exist but again that doesnt make me suddenly enjoy the process of gaining access to them.
To go back to chores, yes I like having a clean room but that doesnt mean im suddenly gonna see the process of picking up all my shit as fun and engaging."

The same applies to exercising.

The process makes me feel bad about myself, takes more willpower than I have to initiate, and leaves me feeling physically drained after, I don't understand how anyone can be like ""Oh heeeelll yeah I cant wait to go to the gym today its gonna be so much fun""

How is that entertaining, its literally torture."
