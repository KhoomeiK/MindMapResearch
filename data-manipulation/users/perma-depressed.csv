SuicideWatch,febvgbw,t1_febvbkg,1578963153.0,Pretty sure that “Filth” was a metaphor...
SuicideWatch,febur26,t1_febt7us,1578962963.0,What the hell are you implying?
offmychest,fe4iw6g,t1_fe4gvz3,1578859822.0,"Moments are made throughout life and are always relative. Imagine going to a play, the actors perform probably 8 nights a week, but to you that show/night could mean the world! You aren’t too late, it will never be too late for memories! That said, I understand your fear, I know that I ask this question a lot, 

“what if my future best friend is waiting right around the corner/asking me to go to something/needing me right now, and I can’t be there for them?” 

But then I have to remind myself of the problem within that question. Your best friend/deeper and more meaningful relationships aren’t made with some soon to be stranger found by fate, but rather who you decide you want a deeper relationship with. I understand that it’s scary because college is a really fun time with loads of fun things to do, but,
A. Life doesn’t end after college, and
B. You live in a world of endless communication! 

Your fear is valid, and it really sucks that your parents are being like that, but you can still make friends with a deep connection!"
offmychest,fe49p76,t3_enr2pv,1578857106.0,"Man, I can 100% relate. Only difference is that my parents were less controlling (and I was a coward due to medical issues). It still feels that way with friends sometimes, but friendship isn’t perfect, even with those that seem most put together, that isn’t always the case. You’re 23!!! You still have time, but most importantly, you are an adult!! Now, I’m assuming that if your parents track your phone and you go along with it, that must be for some reason—say financial help?—but that will end soon once you finish college! Furthermore, you asked it best, 

“As if I can’t be my own person?” 

EXACTLY! You can, and will be, your own self! It is certainly hard to get to that point where you are confident in who you are, but almost everyone gets there and with some of your other questions and statements, you are on your way man!! Good luck!!!"
SuicideWatch,fdkpl1i,t3_elwnui,1578508498.0,Yea! Worth a shot right?
SuicideWatch,fdk2qes,t1_fdjs1kl,1578494620.0,"Wonderful! That voice telling you they don’t care is something I’ve had to deal with all the time. It isn’t fun, but when you outsmart yourself by setting up close support groups, it sure does feel good."
offmychest,fdj9gjg,t1_fdj98dc,1578462328.0,Thanks for sticking around and lighting things up on this bitch of an earth :)
SuicideWatch,fdj7ifm,t3_elntx4,1578460644.0,"I’m sorry about all that you’ve had to go through. I know it must be rough especially without your grandpa. I will say that when I first came out as gay, I felt a whole lot like you did. Every time we’d share a glance, I thought they held a tinge of resentment for me (they are baptists afterall). But then, after a while, I realized that things were better. Not perfect, but better. My mom and dad were still them, they were still the parents who raised me with love, and I was still there kid. I think a lot of why I thought they were mad/disappointed with me, actually stimed from me being mad/disappointed in myself. You could try bringing these feelings up with your parents, it might show them that you need a lil bit more support right now. 

As for your mother openly dissing your father, I can’t really relate. If it bothers you, I think most people would bring that up with her. If you don’t mind her venting/complaining, but don’t want them to split, well you can’t really do much there but try giving them support. 

Finally, not all school consolers are good consolers. You might try bringing the cutting up to either your parents or your consoler. They might be able to get you to see licensed psychologists/therapists that better suits you. Also, you could look into getting medicine if you feel you need/want it.

I really want you to know that this is a very important first step, and that you’ve already passed one of the hardest parts. Good luck on the rest of your journey, it might be long, but it gets better."
offmychest,fdj5ouo,t3_elnu76,1578459156.0,"Hey, it’s okay to be feeling the things your feeling! Everyone griefs differently! I really wouldn’t worry about being heartless because you clearly have empathy for your dad. All that said, yeah, it does suck. Having so many people leave in such a short amount of time is really hard for everyone involved. No one would blame you (or your family for that matter) for reaching out for help. It’s okay to talk to people about it and I think it’s wonderful that you did reach out! I hope your Aunt gets better, but even if she doesn’t, you said it best, 

“They’re fine. They’re at peace wherever they are.”"
WritingPrompts,fdctxc2,t3_eko090,1578284210.0,"And for the first time see nothing. “What? That’s strange.” As you ponder to yourself. The Wizard picks up on your tells and uses it to his advantage. He’d been planning your demise for years now, crafting the right mix of spells, talking to the right people, and of course watching you very closely. By now he was quite keen on just about all of your possible responses, and it just so happened that you fell into the one response that elicited the most benefit for The Wizard, silence. Slowly, the guards look at you with worry, eager to eavesdrop an answer.

“Hmm! Can you not see anything? How peculiar!” The room marinates with tension. “Wait! I know! You can’t predict your own future can you?” You flush red with equal parts embarrassment and anger. “If you see no one else as the sacrifices, then that leaves only you on the chopping block i’m afraid.” He uncovers a smile that looks like snakes filled his teeth. “Pity to sacrifice someone so useful,” The Wizard motions to the gaurds to restrain you for preparation. “Yet, how useful is an oracle who can lie? That is a question far beyond me.” 

Repressed memories from your days that commenced after your oracle training surge through your mind. You had met with The Wizard, and he asked you who to sacrifice, when you saw your best friend on the altar you knew you had to lie. You covered up your stillness with a bold answer, you said The Wizard’s mother was supposed to be sacrificed.

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fd7ga7s,t3_ek8wwo,1578204027.0,"Very similar story! I was afraid of them coming from under my new “big boy” bunkbed (I was like 4/5) so I’d sleep underneath the bed. I figured that they got through some kinda magical trap door so if I slept on top of it, they couldn’t get through."

TrueOffMyChest,fcp60g8,t3_eidm8f,1577851606.0,"Wonderful job listening to your gut!!! You started part one of saving someone’s life!!! If you wish to continue, the next step is to GET HER MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!! Even if she didn’t take pills, your priority should be to convince her to turn herself into a hospital (or something along those lines) if you can’t do it today, it will suck, but you should probably stay up . Odds are, you stopped her actions, but she still probably has suicidal thoughts. Good job! Things will be okay!! The road to recovery is upon you!!!"
