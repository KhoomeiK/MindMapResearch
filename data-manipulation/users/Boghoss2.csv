AskReddit,fcmd3rm,t3_ehykc9,1577771021.0,"Hey - you know that people don't know the real you, right? Do you want them to know the real you? Of course you don't, so why are you thinking about it. Stop thinking about it. You know that thing that happened at work today? Yeah - probably going to torpedo you, but don't focus on that - people don't know who you really are. Do you have enough wine for tomorrow? Should you open a bottle to test it now? Why aren't you asleep yet? (ad infinite)"
AskReddit,fcmctcv,t3_ehyl9r,1577770758.0,So long...and thanks for all the fish.

dresdenfiles,fcm21lk,t3_ehutcw,1577762183.0,"Do us all a favor. Put a pin in this one, and then come back to it. Frequently. >!Many people say that Grave Peril is where everything happens that we don't understand the ramification of yet (even now at the end of 2019), but for right now, at this point, I think this book is where so much is developed that comes to fruit later on. I, for one, look forward to my re-read of all the books once we get to the ""end"" to see which book truly deserves that title.!<"
aww,fcm1foa,t1_fcm15l3,1577761737.0,"One would think so, but I have to say no. I lived in Augusta, GA for about 8 months as well, and I didn't get the same vibe as I did in Abilene. Indiana is between the two, as is Denver, but Missoula, MT is wall-to-wall great people."
aww,fclyizo,t1_fclxrhi,1577759607.0,"I only lived there for about 8 months, but everyone there made me feel right at home from Day #1. It's been over 3 years, but I still think back to the people I met in Abilene because they were all good people."
survivor,fait59l,t3_e960f7,1576116002.0,So - how could it happen off camera? I thought they had cameras on the players 24/7.
