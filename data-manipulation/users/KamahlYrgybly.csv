Haven't run into any real bugs so far, except sometimes entering missions with an empty magazine.

Haven't, yet, come across serious balance issues either; have lost just one soldier during my campaign, and the enemies are armoring up quite a bit but fights still remain manageable, if drawn out.

In Finland it was such a straight-forward process. The only tricky part was getting into med school. Once you're in, you are in a tube that lasts for 6 years, and you pop out the other end a medical doctor with a kind of general practice qualification. There aren't very many things you have to make actual decisions about during this period, except a few short internships, and one research project. Specialization (another 5-6 years) is started only after graduating, and you can change the field as many times as you like, or complete several if you like.

Once you graduate, you are on the exact same level as all the other 700+ doctors that graduate nationwide pretty much the same day. But there's plenty of work to go around so long as you're not too picky, so unemployment for doctors is pretty much non-existent.

 I'm not sure what I'd do with the Cyclops, it's always seemed underwhelming as a mech except for its initiative bonus, but with that loadout it must always enter brawl range to do anything, which is pretty risky.

PPC's are not very good for their tonnage and massive heat problems. I would switch them out of the Atlas for LLasers, and upgrade the LRM's with the freed up tonnage and reduced need for heat sinks.
