It kind of spooked me on the deal. That and Im not sure if I should take that big of a leap on a guitar. I still have a lot of love to give my $200 Epi.

Based off your pieces being .925, that makes me think you're using flatware, or jewelry? Possibly from pawn shops or flea markets? Go to a bullion seller, APMEX or JM Bullion are very reputable. .999 Silver, cost you $19-$20 an ounce. Similar premiums with .999 Gold. As opposed to ""Solid 14k"" which also makes me thinking you're melting jewelry. Go buy a quarter ounce of .999, $30-$40 premium."

Edit 2: ""Pure Gold is too soft to use"", is a myth.[ Websites like these specialize in Investment Jewelry](https://mene.com/) that are all 24k, actually Pure, Solid Gold. Unlike 14k which is only 58%"
