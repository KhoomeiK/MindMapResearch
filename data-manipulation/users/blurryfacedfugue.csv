I've been alive for a little bit now, so I've had a quarter of a lifetime to read through various sources (news, online, and otherwise) to try and keep up.  It's probably been over five or ten years since I've read Taiwan's wikipedia page ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan)) and I think that would be an okay place to start.  But of course, one should read carefully because it seems like anyone can make edits.  

Your parents probably know a lot more than they're letting on, but it seems like they have their reasons.

If you have any general questions though I'd be happy to try and answer them to my limited ability.  I do know (from my best understanding) that there are aboriginals, the first people to arrive in Taiwan.  Then there are the (generally fishermen and pirates I believe?) immigrants from China.  In my mind, time, and in part because China really DGAF about Taiwan until modern times, that these two groups are more of the ""original"" people in Taiwan.  These two groups were subjugated by the imperialistic Japanese in WW2, who turned both groups of people into second class citizens, forcing them into labor and killing them in the name of ""modern progress"".  

The next group of people that arrived were the Nationalists who fled from China after losing the civil war against the Chinese Communist Party.  Those guys were/became the KMT and did the same thing and subjugated the two prior groups, and it wasn't until I think the 90s when there was political parity for the first Chinese immigrants (while Taiwan has done some to acknowledge aboriginals, I think they were kind of screwed like most aboriginals, but someone feel free to correct me because my knowledge about this part is lacking).  At least by that point that second group of Chinese people were fully Taiwanese, IMO.  

For the longest time the KMT claimed they were the real China, and that they were going to take back the Mainland.  Obviously this didn't happen and now China is a superpower.  This third group of people are generally more pro-unification, though I can't understand why for the life of me.  I do really hope that this group of people paid attention to HK because there is no way China is going to welcome those people like brothers in arms.  

My ancestors are those second group of people, what with being tenant farmers and all.  I do want to mention that people's opinions can be really nuanced.  There are some people in my family that have married with that third group of people, and some of them I consider ""real Taiwanese"" because they love Taiwan, want to stay there, and have no illusions about how China would treat them.

Hopefully this has some stuff you didn't know, and is helpful for others who might be curious about Taiwan.  Oh, I totally forgot to mention that before the Japanese there were the Dutch, back when they had an enormous trading empire.  My knowledge about that period is fuzzy, but I do know there are still some buildings, like a fort (a tourist place now) that were built by them.  I think there is also a community of Dutch in Taiwan...I think I'll do more research :D"

I agree with you, but again I have to qualify that with people in positions of authority, like her, ""should"" have to state some qualifiers, rather than straight out say, ""MMR vaccines cause autism, you know"".  I mean, she's in a position of trust, and scientists don't even know exactly what causes autism.  In my opinion, her making a statement like that is dangerous.  Its like when our president says the free press are the enemy of the people--there are people that, just because its the president saying it, that they believe the statement 100%  

And while I agree reviews and the such can help,  I also know from experience that the quality of a review is entirely dependent on who is doing the reviewing.  There can be lots of people who have for whatever reason been predisposed to believing her; what if it just happens that for that particular institution, most reviews show support for anti-vaxxers?  This would case a third party to be even more convinced, despite there being little evidence or experts saying that there is anything close to a causal link between the two.  I guess I just feel that just reviews don't protect the public enough.  

As far as constitutional rights goes, there are limitations to speech.  Hate speech, and speech like yelling ""fire"" or ""there's a bomb"" is understandably limited, so I feel that kind of speech is getting close to the kind of speech that requires regulation.  I don't see a problem as long as people are making qualifiers, such as ""I feel"", rather than making statements of fact when they are not facts but opinions.  To me that is a dangerous misrepresentation.  And if its a mistake, I feel that is okay too--but I feel that people who make these kind of claims just double down despite the evidence provided by experts."

Your primary hand holds the chopsticks, while your offhand holds the ricebowl so you can ""shovel"" rice.  At least that's been my experience in those three countries.

kratom,fdi3lxm,t1_fdi1cvh,1578435134.0,">however I dont have an issue with people speaking their mind as this is allowed in this country. 

My opinion is that this goes beyond them speaking their mind.  If they qualified things like I said before, I'd be a lot more okay with it.  I also don't have any problems with listening to someone if they have what is needed to back up their arguments, but I feel this goes way beyond that.  Further, powerful special interests are able to speak much more loudly than your average American.  I think this is one of the big reasons why there are so many people in America that vote \*against\* their interests; they've been convinced by the money that be (through ""grass-roots"" influence campaigns--I recall some powerful interests, the Koch brothers, iirc, convincing communities that public transportation is bad.  I recall the stats went from 40% against to 60% against after they spent their money.  The Koch's did that because of their many business interests.  I think I saw this on the Patriot Act with Hassan Minhaj if you wish to know more).  

As far as censoring, I don't think I could really do much as a private citizen, but I feel strongly that if management knew then they have a responsibility to do something.  As far as breaking the law, there are many unethical things (as misguided as they might be) that aren't against the law, but I still feel strongly against doing those things.  And while I also support freedom of speech, I have to go back to my previous point that powerful special interests are able to control what some  people see and hear.  

I'll give you an example: if you're a person who supports Trump, and you only look at Fox news, Brietbart, subscribe to Trump's tweets, are in pro-Trump only Facebook groups and tunneling through the alt-right rabbit holes, you'll be shocked and really believe that everyone else is fake news since \*no one else\* other than those in your media stream are saying what you're seeing.  Those people are unable to see things from all sides, and therefore are not able to make an informed decision."

kratom,fdi12q3,t1_fdgudm6,1578433853.0,"I think that maybe she should be censored.  Opinions are one thing, which I think is fine.  I'd be okay with her attitude if she said something like, ""while most doctors do not think there is a link between autism and vaccinations, I personal think so because of x, y, and z"".  I don't have a big problem with people expressing their \*opinions\*, but most people who are anti-vax make it like a statement of fact.  Even if they \*feel\* sure, they (IMO) abuse their position of authority  when they make a definitive statement like that.  People will believe her \*because\* she's in the medical field.  

I mean, we as a society would not be okay with a doctor promoting something that we all agree on to be harmful.  Like...if a doctor told you that you're sick because of black bile, and that you need to use leeches to remove the sickness/""poison"" from your body.  I feel strongly that people in positions of authority must have greater responsibility because people tend to be (rightfully so, since if we can't believe the experts, who should we believe?) persuaded by experts."

Their ilk bear a huge responsibility in creating this divisiveness in this country, all for their own political gain.  

IMO the anger we progressives have are a natural and correct response to all the partisan craziness going on in this country.  I mean, if you watched just some of the impeachment inquiry, the Democrats still tried to act in the interests of our nation, whereas the GOP could only attack Democrats as enemies of this country.  I think we'd be a lot less divisive if Fox was exposed to their viewers for what it really is, which is basically pro-Trump propaganda at this point."
