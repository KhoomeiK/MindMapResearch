Those clinics provide healthcare to over 20 million Americans today. Another thing Sanders got in the ACA was the ability for states to initiate pilot programs using ACA money to establish more comprehensive healthcare systems than the ACA was offering, as well as 1.5 billion for scholarships and loan repayment for doctors and nurses who work in underserved communities. He also worked to rally other far left members of Congress who were turned off to the ACA after the public option was removed. Here's Harry Reid talking about how Sanders was instrumental in getting the ACA passed
