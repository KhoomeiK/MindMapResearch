AskReddit,ffepvnu,t1_ffdsq4k,1579859516.0,"Two things you don't understand about government services:

1) They rely on taxpayer money. If the money is not there, the government can't magic up great services.

2) If the government mismanages the money (e.g. if corruption is rampant) it can easily be spent poorly.

Nothing about a ""free market"" magically addresses these kind of problems. If your country is poor and preyed upon by wealthy imperialistic and capitalistic countries, good luck having a magic boon from free enterprise. You'll be taken advantage of in new and interesting ways. And good luck with avoiding corruption. The wealthy capitalists will take over your government and eke every cent out of you they can get.

If you're alluding to living in America now with the ""competition"" line, you're welcome for the public roads, libraries, and the national parks system. All government services that the taxpayer pays for and all mostly high quality services. 

Oh and from another response of yours:

>  They haven't lived it, fair enough, but they dismiss the opinions of those who have with that idiotic ""not real socialism"" quote that you mentioned.

> Absolutely ridiculous to read some of the garbage that is spouted here - especially by people who think Sweden is socialist.

You can't seem to make up your mind what your criticism even is. You describe the problem as centering around low quality government services and then say that Sweden (referenced for its quality government services) is not socialist.

Just admit. *You* don't know what socialism is. Just because you lived in a country that may have called itself socialist doesn't mean you are an authority on socialism and understand everything there is to know about the ins and outs of government.

It's pretty clear you've made little effort to explore beyond a single-minded worldview.

See, the thing is, people like me... I really believed in capitalism at one time and there were reasons to believe in it, or at least, there seemed to be. Not everything was totally shitty and it still isn't, and I heard the rah rah about competition and the free market and innovation and I bought it hook, line, and sinker. Why not? It seemed so convincing. Cool gadgets, the advancement of technology and society. 

What I didn't realize at the time is how little any of those buzzwords and advancements had to do with capitalism. What had happened was that in my country's case (the US) it happened to be in the right place at the right time after WWII, when a lot of other nations were economically wounded or devastated from the war. And imperialistic and predatory people in the country exploited that relentlessly. They used it to build titan industries and they still do to this day.

What is the inherent value of ""competition"" when a corporation outsources to a country where they can get away with using dirt cheap sweatshop labor to eke out a little more profit? Is that the quality you want? Build from blood and exploitation? Or were you thinking of the quality coming from a business seminar with hype music and shouting. 

The wealthy and powerful exploit the poor and powerless. That's the underlying theme you were experiencing in Venezuela. 

When people talk about moving toward socialism, for the most part, they are wanting a democratically-owned version, not a poor and corrupt authoritarian government doing a shitty job of distributing and managing resources.

Power is what's important here and our lives are what's at stake. Competition doesn't bring quality. People do. And people can't bring quality if they are oppressed. I hesitate to oversimplify, but that's kind of the theme here. Capitalism gets a bad rap because it provides an avenue for consolidation of power for the wealthy and exploitation of the working class. 

The US is one of the longest-running democracies there is and its democratic elements are being pushed to the limits due to all the holes that corporate enterprise has shot through it with a cannon. Where you see quality, I see a barely-cobbled-together wealthy nation that's wasting its potential and its edge, so that a handful of people can become kings and play god.

Sure, there's some quality. Of course there is when you're one of the wealthiest nations on the planet with the largest military and a huge amount of global power. Just ask yourself what the cost is. The people in poor countries being exploited for cheap labor. Maybe go ask one of them. Hell, one of them might have been you when you were living in Venezuela. And then you can come and tell me all about the quality of competition. Nah man. You're a mark to these people. And because you went somewhere richer, you think you escaped it? You just went where the power is more consolidated."
coolguides,ffeh655,t1_ffdmktu,1579847839.0,"> It's like going to a master woodworker and having him make you a chair so you can use it to light a fire.

Is it though? If you go to a master woodworker and ask him for a chair so you can light something on fire, he can just offer to sell you wood instead. 

The process you're describing (and the linked to chef describes) of ""birth of the calf to when it's served"" is largely out of the customer's hand. The only part the customer has any control over is some general instructions as to how to cook. The customer can't control that it may or may not have been put together to make a high quality steak. 

Furthermore, with regards to the point about high-end versus not, it may not be the customer's choice to have gone to a high-end restaurant in the first place. Maybe it was part of somebody else's plan, for example. Or maybe they're going to a high-end restaurant for the experience overall, not just for steak.

If a chef wants to get offended, that's their prerogative, but there are way more important things in life to get upset about. If somebody wants to request a high-end steak be burnt, who cares. If somebody wants to build a home theater and then sit in it and watch movies on their iPad, who cares.

But perhaps more importantly, chefs are not all the same and any given person asking for ""well done"" could get vastly different results. Most people ordering steaks are not going to be ordering from Gordon Ramsay levels of chef skill. So you can't reasonably expect people to get on the same page about what is or isn't a reasonable request for steak, when the chefs themselves aren't all going to produce the same thing.

I suspect that part of the appeal of ""well done"" is the unambiguous ""I don't want pink"" embodied in it. Something that is reasonably clear, regardless of the chef's skill.

Honestly, I blame chefs for having such a complex, tiered system of naming for how to cook a steak. Laypeople have no clue what they're talking about most of the time, outside of their areas of expertise. It's unreasonable to expect them to understand the nuances of steak cooking and then order accordingly, like a good and well-trained customer. 

If it's really a problem for some gourmet chef, just have the waiter start the question by asking, ""Do you want any pink in it?"" And then if they say yes or no, then you can list the options within that. If you're an expert at something and you give people the option to make what you deem bad decisions, they will make them. As Douglas Adams famously writes in one of the Hitchhiker's books:

When you put it that way, I don't think that is a low bar. I'm not saying it's a high bar either, but I wouldn't call it low. 

It only seems low insofar as there are certain normal expectations about human decency and maturity. But in terms of the effort put in, things like ""take care of yourself"" and ""continuously work on personal development"" can be quite the investment for some people. I would say they are important for being in a *healthy* relationship, don't get me wrong.

Saying you would and actually doing it are worlds apart. Saying you would doesn't make you a psychopath. It makes you human. You have empathy toward someone who was hurt by another person and you feel some kind of desire for revenge/vengeance/etc. against the person who did it. 

Doing it out of a sense of revenge (or ""justice"" if you want to call it that - it's revenge, but I suppose you can call it what you want) and then proceeding to sleep easy about it probably wouldn't make you a psychopath either, but it might make you dangerous to society. What's to stop a mind like that from, for example, deciding that a justice system has failed and carrying out vigilante justice with no trial.

Or if using a wire is simply not feasible (in the case of wifi services, for example - far more realistic to offer wireless internet services than set up hundreds of cables for people to hook into). 

Why it's so fundamental has to do with the simple notion of signals and wires, that obviously something that can send a single directly through a wire is going to be more reliable than something that has to pick up transmissions through the air. 

So... generally speaking, don't believe companies if they try to sell you on wireless technology in personal devices. Odds are if it's a personal device, you can use a wire without any inconvenience of it outweighing the fundamentally unreliable nature of wireless technology."

Plus, the ""movement"" you describe is never going to stick. It's the kind of adage that is always going to have people who range from skeptical to fearful to adamantly and aggressively against it.

That said, the mindset of it is not entirely unreasonable when applied critically. You just have to look at each allegation on a case by case basis and take context and details into account. Sometimes the indications are that you should probably believe the victim. Sometimes the indications are that you probably shouldn't. 

The problem is, I find that sometimes when people insist on the ""but it's innocent until proven guilty!"" perspective, they're insisting on it while spending little to no time analyzing the context of the given allegations. They are just knee-jerk saying ""but it's innocent until proven guilty, must be a court of law!"" In much the same way that some people knee-jerk say ""guilty! guilty!""

One example of where it makes more sense to lean toward believing the victim is if the alleged perpetrator is famous and powerful in some way, and the victim has a real risk of losing their own reputation, career, and possibly being disrupted and harassed by death threats over it, while having very little, if anything, to gain. And I'm not just saying that as a hypothetical. There have been cases of accusers getting death threats. IIRC, that was the case with Kavanaugh's main accuser.

Getting back around to the point at hand, I think you'd find people can be a lot more willing to listen to nuance and context than you might think. And it's also important to remember that sometimes victims face the very thing you fear when considering reporting someone:

The consuming hobby is for making sure you have a space where you can zone out and relax, not give a shit, etc.

The producing hobby is so you have something of value you can share with others (or enjoy yourself). Especially important, I think, if your job is unfulfilling.

Examples of consuming hobbies would be things like: Video games, television, books

Examples of producing hobbies would be things like: Woodworking, writing, singing/instrument-playing

You could also classify video games under producing if you turned it into something where you film yourself playing and try to be entertaining or informative to others. But mixing consuming and producing hobbies can be dangerous, as you can end up ruining the ability to jump into your consuming hobby and zone out, with it instead turning into a source of work and strain.

The point here is that hard work won't necessarily lead to a better life, which is true. The point is not that hard work can never be useful or important under any circumstances, which would obviously be absurd.

> If you take two young people that are both extremely intelligent but one is driven and the other is not, the driven person will likely be much more ""successful"" than the other. In 10 years the highly driven individual would likely have an advanced degree and being on a great track for lifelong success, while the apathetic or lazy person is probably washing dishes at their hometown restaurant. Let's not pretend hard work is meaningless.

Being driven and working hard is not the same thing. Do you think washing dishes at a restaurant is necessarily easy? 

Being driven just means you're determined to succeed. Something that can be achieved through a variety of means, with hard work being one of the most unreliable paths to do it. Human invention, in fact, is endless with examples of people finding ways to circumvent hard work, so that they can have more leisure time, while still accomplishing what they're asked to do (or expected to do, or need to do). 

Being apathetic and being lazy are not the same thing. You can be apathetic about changing your current circumstances in life and still bust your ass every day. You can be driven about changing your current circumstances in life and circumvent hard work with loopholes and ingenuity to get ahead. 

3) Guess what, the people who are most ""successful"" tend to have the most room to be lazy. Whether they choose to be lazy at that point is up to them and their own psyche, but for the most part, ""success"" in the financial and upward career sense means the freedom to give less of a shit and do less work. The idea that hard work is the path to this makes no fundamental sense. Ingenuity, invention, cleverness, these are traits associated with circumventing hard work. 

Training yourself to work hard, so that you can relax at the end is training yourself to work hard forever. 

And I say this as someone who probably has a workaholism problem, psychologically speaking. I just have enough awareness to know I have a problem. Some people have the problem and don't know it's a problem. They define their identity around work and think it's normal.

Which makes sense, if you think about it intuitively. If you work really hard and the boss decides to pay you a bit more, they may have no special relationship with you and have no understanding that you're going to keep it on the down low. You could blast it around and now others may try to get a boost in pay out of the boss, even if they don't work as hard.

If you work really hard and somebody decides to promote you, that may mean they have to work with you more now, or more closely. If they have no special relationship with you, it's now a risk that they're going to have to work more with somebody who is a pain to work with (however hard working they may be).

Of course, this is a cynical and generalized outlook on it. But the point being, people like the people they like and they like to do things for those people. Not as big on doing things for the people they don't know and/or like and/or trust.

But this is one reason why unions are so vital. It cuts out some of the need to schmooze and play crabs in the bucket to get what you want/need. Instead, you can collectively bargain to get what you want/need and you don't have to rely on personally being a charmer. The ones with great technical skill, but low interpersonal skill, and the ones with great interpersonal skill, but low technical skill, get paid fairly and treated fairly alike. And that's not only healthier for the workers, it's healthier for the workplace. Because any workplace that treats people well only on how well they schmooze is on a fast track to elevating lazy charmers and psychopaths, while neglecting those who have the skill to carry the weight of the labor.

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/07/how-bernie-sanders-fought-for-our-veterans-119708

Here are some highlights:

> The roots of the problem, as usual, were conflicting core philosophies of government and wariness of the other side. “Sanders had the view that McCain was trying to take away the VA and that was his ultimate intention. McCain had the view that Sanders was always going to prop up the VA and never accept any criticism of it,” says Ian DePlanque, chief lobbyist for the American Legion, the country’s largest veterans organization. Neither was actually the case, he says, but that was the impression the pair gave. McCain’s statements were focused on choice and private care, while “if you look at Sanders’ statements, he wanted to use the VA as a model for what single-payer could look like across the country. He has had a tendency to want to show the best of it.” 

> At first it seemed the House and Senate were not all that far apart. But Sanders and his party, with strong backing from the disabled veterans community, wanted to add new money to bolster the VA internally. Miller and the House leadership, meanwhile, wanted to focus on the private-choice program. That produced the one issue big enough and controversial enough to sink the whole enterprise: Whether the VA health system itself should get more money to fix its problems—and if so, how much and where to find it.

> Republicans felt it was out of bounds to interject such a huge sum into the negotiation at such a late stage. They were also annoyed by floor speeches by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. On June 2, Reid said Republicans had blocked a Sanders bill to help the VA meet veterans’ needs back in February because they were worried about “busting the budget.” He said they didn’t worry about that when they sent hundreds of thousands of troops to Iraq on “the credit card of the taxpayers of America” and ran up a $1.5 trillion debt on that war alone. “Republicans ignore the true cost of democracy,” Reid charged. “Republicans focus on the monetary costs only, the dollar bills, because any money going to our veterans is $1 less going to billionaires, corporations and unnecessary tax cuts.”

> The Sanders-Miller meltdown turned out to be the last cathartic paroxysm before a compromise was reached just a couple of days later. The House had offered zero money for VA improvements, while Sanders had asked for close to $9 billion. In the end, both sides agreed to $5 billion. Another $1.5 billion went for leases of 27 major medical facilities in 18 states and Puerto Rico. The two sides also agreed to create a Veterans Choice Fund and put $10 billion into it. The House, which had offered no due process to people being fired, agreed quickly to an appeal within a week, a decision within a month and no pay for the duration of the appeal."

From what I can find, for example, if he didn't directly ask Warren to run in 2016, he was willing to defer to her running rather than himself. There's [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHDsaViTUvo) from 1988 of him talking about how a woman can be president. 

And this is a guy who has never (to my knowledge) shown any signs of believing that women are somehow inferior to men. 

So that makes a sexist framing of this highly unlikely.

You could still argue that possibility that he said a woman couldn't win as a matter of strategy, but entertaining that idea seems stupid, especially given what he claims to have said. 

> ""It is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn't win,” Sanders said. He acknowledged that gender came up during their conversation. “What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could,"" Sanders said.

And this isn't a typical politician who tends to flip flop and sprinkle lies where needed. This is a guy who has been saying the same shit for decades. This is a guy who tends to resist attacking political opponents directly, sometimes (arguably) to his own detriment.

Given that, the most generous interpretation I can take from this is that Warren believed that's what Sanders said at the time, held it inside for all this time while pretending to be his ally, and then, like some passive-aggressive grudge, let out her interpretation of events when a journalist leaked it.

She could have stood in solidarity with Bernie and called the media out for creating a nonsense feud and trying to slander someone that she believes has integrity. She did nothing of the kind. Instead, she subtly implied she believed the allegations to be true; claiming it was a pedantic disagreement.

I struggle to see this in a light that excuses Warren's behavior so far. If she really is well-intentioned about all of this and meant to be on Bernie's side, then it seems like she's easy to manipulate into looking like a fool.

> in the style of a particular person or thing

https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/in-the-manner-of

""Seconds"" obviously are not a thing that has a style (unless you want to say they have a ""style of speed"") so that alone would be a stretch.

But if we think of it as being more like shorthand for, ""in a manner of something very fast,"" I think it could fly (well, ok, not unless it has wings, but it could pass as legible English - just probably not to an English teacher). Granted, using it in this way would be vague and silly as it would beg the question, ""Well what definition of fast are you using and why didn't you simply say what specific metric of speed you're using for comparison?"" The usage of ""a"" instead of ""the"" also makes it read extra awkward.

That being said, ""Bear effortlessly scales a cliff in the manner of a bear"" just doesn't quite have weight to it, does it (the bear has weight, undoubtedly, but not necessarily the English words speaking about it). You could say, ""Bear effortlessly scales a cliff in the manner of a jet engine,"" but that's clearly exaggeration. It scaled the cliff remarkably or unremarkably (depending on how you feel about a bear's ability to scale cliffs) in the manner of a bear, in a matter of seconds. Which may be redundant if the manner of a bear scaling a cliff is typically in the order of seconds relative to cliff size. And if it is effortless too, that may also be redundant, relative to your given metric for cliff scaling difficulty. If we are looking at cliff scaling as normally being difficult and the bear makes it effortless, perhaps we don't need to describe the manner or matter in which they scale it. We can derive the meaning from the effort exerted alone. 

""Bear effortlessly scales cliff."" If this is what bears are wont to do, that's kind of terrifying alone, isn't it? Though the video doesn't quite seem to sell this notion, as the bear is clearly seen exerting effort to reach the top; just not the same level of effort that a human would. 

Or how about, ""Bear outperforms humans in cliff scaling, effortlessly. Takes home gold medal and refuses to pay taxes on it because he's a bear."" That might work in ways where the other sentences don't, but I'm sure the tax collectors couldn't bear the thought of it."

We sure have some dumb ideas about sex in our societies. Probably something to do with so many societies being warring hierarchies obsessed with conquest, over the centuries."
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,felj4ik,t3_ephc7g,1579223413.0,"The current reality in America is more like:

""I'm not left wing or right wing, I agree with some liberal ideas as well as conservative ideas.""

Republican reaction: Would you like to learn more about our lord and savior Donald Trump? You fucking cuck.

Democrat reaction 1: Ok, but what policy positions do you have?

Democrat reaction 2: What do you mean by that?

Democrat reaction 3: Sure you do.

Democrat reaction 4: Oh, fuck off.

Democrat reaction 5: Tell me what they are and we can debate the merits of them.

""Well I'm pro gay and am fine with them being in the military... and also I think the military should ban being trans because they are icky.""

Republican reaction: Let me check the script. Is that pro-Trump or anti-Trump, soy boy?

Democrat reaction 1: You're a bigot then.

Democrat reaction 2: ...

Democrat reaction 3: Well you tried. 

Democrat reaction 4: I told you to fuck off.

Democrat reaction 5: So let's debate this, what makes being transgender so different from being gay?

In other words: You can mostly sum up the republican voters and elected officials as looking to Trump for the script. You can't sum up the democratic voters and elected officials in the same way. You are more likely to get a varied reaction, depending on who you talk to and what you talk to them about.

The more confined the republican tent gets, the more this becomes the reality for the democratic tent. If there isn't room in republican land, the people who want something else will go to the democrats. Because we only have two parties with any sort of strength, so if you want to be heard, it's easiest to pick one or the other."
todayilearned,felfqjp,t1_feldscf,1579221110.0,"You are correct, buying luxury products you don't need when you could be helping others who are in need is a selfish move. Most religions, in fact, would take this stance in spirit, even if their ministers don't always preach it in practice.

Are you now a hypocrite who is unable to criticize any other forms of selfishness if you do this? No. It's one form of selfishness of many. 

People tend to excuse it because they have a lot of shit on their plate and are struggling to get by themselves, so a few luxuries here and there can be something that, while not strictly necessary, helps them get through the next month or year with their sanity intact.

There are some complex moral arguments we could get into, but... bottom line, your example is not the rebuttal that you think it is."

gaming,fel0jq3,t1_fekg1kp,1579211464.0,"Yeah, basically what this means is a bunch of workers are going to get ""asked"" to work overtime, crunched into mental breakdown, for a release date that won't provide a finished game anyway. You could call me cynical, but I'm just describing the reputation of how the video game industry works, especially in the AAA space.

And you can tell based on statements like these:

> ""One of the things about this company has always been we want to show the game industry how to do things,"" he said. ""We want to change the game industry. We want to say, 'We can do things differently, we don't have to do things that way.' It's in our motto: 'We are rebels,' right?""

And the ambitious scope of the game that designers' imaginations are running the show, rather than realistic visions of what can be accomplished with the given team.

I would like to see them ""change the game industry"" by scaling back and producing realistic products in a healthy workplace. Same as the rest of the AAA space."
StarWars,fej3spu,t1_feiecsh,1579155832.0,"Well we are talking about a multi-billion-dollar soulless corporation getting their hands on the most lucrative brand in modern history. You can imagine lofty artistic goals aren't exactly at the top of the priority list. Which, ironically, is probably going to make their magic brand significantly less lucrative in the long-term (in fact, it seems like it's already gone that way and it hasn't been that long yet). 

I'm sure there's a moral of the story in there somewhere that would be completely lost on Disney's executives. Something about how greed can destroy beauty with its blundering pathological need to have more."

gatesopencomeonin,feiy4md,t1_feh4nn0,1579150464.0,"Did you really just try to argue that skimming wikipedia and youtube is equivalent to having a trained professional work you through a guided curriculum with oversight and quality standards, where you are expected to prove you learned something throughout by passing tests and doing exercises to help you retain the material?

I'm not knocking self-teaching as a whole because you can certainly get something of value out of it for free. But it's like the rough equivalent of trying to build a house without having any idea how one is put together. Formal education helps you learn in a structured way, so that your house of knowledge has a strong foundation and you can slowly build greater and greater levels of knowledge by stacking pivotal pieces of fundamental information on top of each other.

If you try to teach yourself, you have no quality control and you're going to be walking around with Titanic iceberg levels of gaps in your knowledge. Not only does this make it harder to learn more on the subject in the future, it risks making your knowledge a house of cards, where a minor gap in understanding can easily turn into an existential crisis, where you're forced to wonder whether you know much of anything at all.

Formal education can suck, of course, and it can churn out people who are confidently wrong, but that's the failure version of it. The best case scenario of formal education is you get people who have the foundational knowledge to learn more, will be on the road to expertise with enough time, and may be able to pass along the knowledge if needed. The best case scenario of self-teaching is that you don't teach yourself to wear your pants on your head and you have enough of a critical thinking mind (that you probably got from formal education!) that you can somewhat discern whether you're being fed total bullshit. If you do really well at it, you may be able to get yourself far enough to pass muster in-between locating some mentors to help you along.

Prolific ways to self-teach is a bandage on the problem of people not having access to formal education. It's not a solution."

I believe you're right, though there is a part of me that's incredulous that isn't the standard already. I almost think that CNN doesn't want that because they'd end up with people who might actually ask interesting questions that expand the imagination of the American people in terms of what the country can look like, rather than playing ""everything you suggest is horrible"" to candidates who want to change a damn thing."
