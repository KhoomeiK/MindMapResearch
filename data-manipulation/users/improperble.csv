This is clearly a sign that you should find your own place, something that's right for you, and then they can keep all their stuff."

shroomers,fdshsil,t1_fdsgb6f,1578703001.0,Yeah don‚Äôt piss about with microdosing if what you‚Äôre looking for is the effect of a proper dose. Just do the proper dose for sure and then you‚Äôll know whether it‚Äôs a potency issue.

But your ex is within her rights to ask you not to, given you are not in each other's lives anymore. You might be the asshole if you ignore her request. I understand her position on this.

Your aggressive response to my post is exactly what I was describing anyway. Agree with the earlier post about cutting down, a little goes some way to helping."
AskReddit,fcx6ej1,t3_ejeeio,1578053129.0,"I stopped eating meat because of climate change. But I would say that it wasn't easy. If you live somewhere where meat eating is the norm, deciding to stop eating meat has a psychological affect on those around you, where they are forced to look at their own actions in a negative light. And this is painful, and can cause people to double-down or insist that their actions are justified. This isn't their fault though; for *all* people, cognitive biases protect ourselves from looking at our own behavior as wrong. We minimize the impact our actions have in order to protect us psychologically from things like regret and shame. It is easy to point to others, or companies, and say ""well i'm not as bad as that person"". This is why meat eating will prevail for a lot longer than it should. In my experience, educating ourselves about cognitive biases is a great way to make more rational decisions."
