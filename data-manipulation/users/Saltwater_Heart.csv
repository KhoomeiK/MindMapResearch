aww,ff63k3w,t1_ff5rrou,1579618252.0,"Me too!!! It’s all I want! Our landlord won’t allow us to have one where we’re at. We’ve been here for 5 years. I’m sooo happy we’re moving in the next two months and we intend to get a dog immediately going into the new place. We even intend on paying the $300 pet fee before we even have a dog because we’re going to go adopt a dog ASAP. The company we’re going through is VERY pet friendly. No breed restrictions.

My last dog died about 7 years ago. I rescued him after he was abandoned by an abusive family. He was already older to begin with but I only got to have him for about 3-4 years before he died. He had horrible back legs from the family and eventually they no longer worked at all and he had to be put down. His name was Jack. He was the goodest boy. I can’t wait to have another dog very soon. I want a dog more than anything else. My kids will be so excited. My oldest is 8. This will be the first dog he gets to actually remember and play with.

I’m a stay at home, homeschooling mom. We’ve got plenty of time for a dog, just wasn’t allowed one."

Tourettes,ff2ac6m,t3_er33ip,1579498556.0,"My son’s tics started when he was four. It was a head twitch thing. At first we thought it was transient tics. Then eventually they developed into chronic tics by the time he was 5. Now at eight, it’s turned into Tourettes, which his ASD doctor suspected was going to happen. He has a very loud squeal tic that he does constantly along with an arm flail or sometimes it’s him stiffening his whole body during the squeal.

My tics also started as a head twitch at around 12. I don’t think I have Tourettes, but I do have diagnosed chronic tic disorder."

Now they’re pregnant again and this time they’re about 15 weeks along and know they’re having a little girl. Still plenty of time for it to go wrong but this is the farthest they’ve ever gotten. They have two ultrasounds a week and it’s looking very good. I’m very hopeful they’ll get to hold their baby girl.

IdiotsInCars,fdydn2d,t3_en9ps8,1578778643.0,"Freaking idiots. My husband, while we were still just dating, once drifted around a corner, showing off for my brother. He didn’t see a car, swerved to miss it and totaled the car into a tree on the passenger side where I was sitting. I got whiplash and PTSD and nightmares and couldn’t sit in the front seat of cars for quite a while and he felt major guilt at the idea that he could have killed me (my brother - about 12 y/o, I was 18 - was perfectly safe buckled into the back seat). He promised me he’d never pull a stupid stunt like that again. It’s been 10 years and he hasn’t. Driving recklessly ISN’T cool. 

I mean if you want to go somewhere where you aren’t a danger to others, I have no problem seeing what cool things you can do with your car, but with others in your car or around your car, it’s just idiotic. This guy endangered passengers and other drivers."
