entertainment,ffatlcu,t1_ffaly06,1579744185.0,"I’m at work right now so I don’t have time to reply properly. But this more recent study found that Vegans aren’t as deficient as older studies show, likely due to better education and supplemented food.

Don’t forget animals are given b12 supplements, and dietary intake doesn’t necessarily translate into absorption, so the safest option for everyone is to supplement.

From your own study:

“Contrary to popular belief, not only strict vegetarians (vegans) are at high risk of vitamin B-12 deficiency, and there is strong evidence that status reflects usual intake across a wide range.”"

trashy,ff4q1ds,t1_ff4hpc5,1579569686.0,"Do you honesty not see the irony in your statement? Live and let live? It would be funny if it wasn’t so sad. 

The meat industry and fur industry is the antithesis of ‘live and let live’. You MUST kill animals to get those things. You’re not letting anything live, you just don’t want your safe space being disturbed. Nothing harmonious about systematically killing trillions of animals every year, for taste/clothing preference"
vegan,fexa2ta,t1_fewwxtz,1579427516.0,"A will to distribute personal possessions is a big jump from the original suggestion people don’t get mistreated or killed because it’s their birthright.

What’s the difference between a pet and a wild animal in terms that are relative to their ability to be abused? They both feel pain in the exact same way. Why is it illegal to kill someone’s pet dog for meat but not a pig at a farm? It’s got nothing to do with property rights as I stated before. The word pet is an arbitrary distinction that can be applied to any living creature. People have pet pigs and cows and chickens. They play and interact with humans in very similar ways to dogs.

Animals most certainly ‘crave’ freedom. Have you ever seen an animal locked in a cage? They try to get out, they become stressed, what do you think they are expressing when they do that? 

On the point of ‘purpose’. Just because some animals are raised for food, doesn’t mean their mistreatment somehow becomes ethical. If I raised my own dogs for dogfighting, raised cats for fur, or human beings for slaves, those things don’t suddenly become ethical either. Beings have no ‘purpose’ outside of the one they choose themselves. 

If you think ways that animals are butchered are so regulated and painless, would you send your dog to a slaughterhouse to be put down? What about an elderly person? You’re quite clearly lying to yourself about the reality of what goes on inside one of those places in case you are just unaware [take a look](https://youtu.be/XAWcjIFwZ2Q) 

And before you say some places do it cleanly and painlessly, please show me evidence. Because it seems there is no non violent way to butcher an individual."
vegan,fewlsyt,t1_few43n6,1579413948.0,"I don’t agree with the death penalty. Not to mention there would be outcry from human rights activists across the world if countries started killing convicts the same way animals are slaughtered in the food industry. They are also (hopefully) not innocent beings being killed. They are criminals facing consequences for crimes they have committed against other people. So you can’t compare that to animal agriculture. Innocent beings who certainly do not get killed by injection, they are killed violently. Try to find any slaughterhouse footage that proves otherwise. 

Let’s entertain the fact that it is painless. If I kill you or people you knew, or maybe just peoples pets, would it be morally acceptable if it was painless/quick? Or does the act of taking someone’s life without their consent make it immoral? Regardless of how it’s done.

Humans do not have birthrights. We grant humans rights as a society because we recognise them as beings deserving of said rights. Black people didn’t use to have rights, and women were treated as intellectually inferior. We now know that’s bullshit and any differences between us are irrelevant to the things we have in common. Murder is illegal because it takes away an individuals right to live their life in freedom, and avoid harm at the hands of others. 

Women were granted voting rights because they have the same mental capacity to make decisions about politics as men. Now seeing as other animals also have a capacity to suffer and feel pain, and also desire freedom, is it not possible to think that we grant them similar rights to not be murdered/abused? Pets are already protected, why not other animals? We don’t protect pets from abuse because they are someone’s property, otherwise owners abusing their own pets would be legal. 

You said it’s okay because we are stronger. That is a ‘might makes right’ argument. The strong are morally justified in their actions because the weak can’t stop them. This kind of thinking allows for all kinds of atrocities: child abuse, rape, animal abuse, racial genocide. I think you are against those things, so it’s fair to say being able to do something ‘because we are stronger’ is not justification in doing it when you are affecting other beings. 

Lastly humans do not operate in a ‘food chain’ as you imagine. We are systematically breeding billions of animals into existence to eat them. Even if we were hunting our food which would be a food chain. That still wouldn’t make it morally justifiable. Just because something is natural doesn’t mean it’s good. Rape, murder, cancer, disease, mental illness are all things that occur in nature. We are trying our damn hardest as a society to avoid or end those things because we realise they cause harm. Killing animals when you can eat nuts, beans, legumes, etc. For protein instead is not a morally justifiable act when you have access to alternatives."
vegan,fevugwg,t1_feux3vq,1579401658.0,"Not OP. 

I’d like you to tell me what does ‘humane’ in the context of killing an animal? 

What is the difference between humans and non human animals that makes killing them justifiable? 

‘Because Humans are humans’ is not a logical standpoint. Its a fallacy called ‘begging the question’, I.e you are attempting to answer the question by rephrasing the question."
vegan,fevsirg,t1_feu5v2f,1579400927.0,"Animal agriculture has a terrible effect on all of those things. So I think the meme is incredibly accurate, but only if you know how bad animal agriculture is. 

If you care about loss of habitats but support animal agriculture, you’re either a hypocrite or ignorant to the facts.

If you care enough about climate change to be vocal and active, but support animal agriculture, you’re a hypocrite or ignorant to the facts.

If you care about sentient life being needlessly taken away but support animal agriculture, you’re a hypocrite or ignorant to reality. 

And by support I mean giving these industries money so that they continue to produce a product for you. 

Not to mention the incredible amount of water used, animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of deforestation and habitat loss. Meanwhile the Australian government is genociding the camels because they drink too much water. The issue seems really clear cut to us."
vegan,fevoe50,t1_fet77tn,1579399690.0,"False dilemma. The options aren’t between dying of smoke inhalation / fire, and ‘dying swiftly’ at a slaughter house. 

You’re not doing something noble by allowing farm animals to die by captive bolt that fails 20% of the time, then slitting their throats. 

The option is between not killing sentient creatures and killing them. I think harming animals is abuse, I think you probably do too, you just like to believe breeding someone into a horrible existence to later slit their throat is not abuse. 

Not to mention animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction and habitat loss, so you’re already funding the stuff you’re against, you just don’t see it all on the news."

BrandNewSentence,fee09ny,t1_fedbdmm,1579023662.0,"I’ll bullet this so it’s easier to reply to if you want to. Up to you though 

1. I’ve been vegan for 5 years so no it’s not new information for me, you never stop caring about or calling out social injustice. 

2. It’s a ground breaking documentary that came out in 2018 using drones as well as undercover cameras, so whilst you might be ‘aware’ of practices, no it’s not something you have ‘seen before’.

3. You have no problem with those things. But I’m sure you’d have a problem if it were your dog or a human being in those situations. What is the reason it’s okay to do it to some animals but not others? Does that reason actually hold water philosophically? 

4. Why would the alternative to keeping domesticated animals be the wild? That’s a false dichotomy. The alternative is that the world goes vegan over a number of decades. As that happens the demand for meat drops and less animals and less animals are being bred into existence until the rest can live out their lives on sanctuaries until they die. 

5. Again, why are you comparing a living situation entirely of human design to the wild? You could justify a whole range of horrible things by saying ‘well it’s better than dying to wolves in the wild’... yeah or we could just not do either? Just eat a plant based diet.

6. My plants aren’t intentionally and cruelly reared body parts. They are a thousand times cleaner than any animal food. They also aren’t incredibly resource wasteful."
vegan,fecqmq7,t1_fecjpbt,1578981027.0,"You may not be aware but even ‘backyard chickens’ had to be bred somewhere. Only the females lay eggs, which means the males are killed, current industry standard is to grind them up alive or gas them. There are also ethical concerns about egg laying hens current state (selectively bred to produce as many eggs as possible which is havoc for their bodies and causes medical problems. Their wild equivalent lays only 12 eggs a year). 

I know you may not see non human animals as deserving of the same freedom as I do, but ultimately their bodies (in this case reproductive systems) are not ours to take advantage of. You said that it’s impossible to compare it to humans because we are so different, but I’m curious what it is you think that makes humans different in that regard?

Some humans, children etc. Are not capable of giving consent or understanding the consequences of certain things, that’s why we should protect them from those who want to take advantage of their lack of intelligence or naïveté. Even if they are not being directly harmed by the action, we try to protect their freedom or dignity. Why can’t we protect other animals too?"
vegan,fecjhox,t1_feci9tv,1578975417.0,"If your idea of moral or humane includes ending the life of an innocent individual that didn’t want to die, I’d like you to think why that would be a totally unacceptable thing to do to humans, but not to non human animals?

BrandNewSentence,feciefq,t1_feccgkh,1578974662.0,"What’s the most positive way of framing what goes on? You would have to lie by omission to make it sound positive.

I didn’t mention how the calves are kept in small pens where they can’t move and are fed formula then killed veal. Or the other male calves that are shot in the head because they serve no purpose to the farmer. I didn’t mention the infections that commonly happen on udders that cause pus to go into the milk. Or the farmer sticking his hand up the cows arse whilst she can’t move, so he can artificially inseminate her 

That’s the reality of animal agriculture, not some negative framing. It sounds horrible because it is horrible. Even if you think that only happens at factory farms, that’s where 99% of the food production comes from. They are very much the norm, not the exception.
