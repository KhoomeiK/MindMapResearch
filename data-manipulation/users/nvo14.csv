loseit,fdq0wne,t3_emlqxf,1578649364.0,"Thanks for sharing this. I think what's important is that you start by setting very small goals that you feel comfortable to continue for a long period of time. Maybe walking on the treadmill was already too high - not because of the actual exercise, but because you have to motivate yourself to go to the gym, change, do sport, etc. Maybe start smaller and just say to yourself - ok I gonna go for a walk for 10 or 15 minutes everyday. After some time you can then constantly improve from there. 

You can do the same approach with food - start with one home cooked meal a week, then two, then three, and so on.

Honestly, where you start doesn't matter at all in the long term, it will have absolutely no effect - AS LONG as you step by step improve constantly.

May I add one more quick way to expand your POV: **ask people for feedback**! In my opinion, the easiest way to expand your own view is through a dialogue with other people and their POVs.

**Have a look at the post** ""Ask everyone for feedback"" in the subreddit **HabitExchange**, which describes very well how you can develop a habit to continuously learn from your environment through feedback.

**The big advantage:** other methods loose their impact after some time. You can only move out once, you can only travel a certain amount of countries, but getting to know people and asking them about their POV gives you unlimited opportunities."

loseit,fdq0wne,t3_emlqxf,1578649364.0,"Thanks for sharing this. I think what's important is that you start by setting very small goals that you feel comfortable to continue for a long period of time. Maybe walking on the treadmill was already too high - not because of the actual exercise, but because you have to motivate yourself to go to the gym, change, do sport, etc. Maybe start smaller and just say to yourself - ok I gonna go for a walk for 10 or 15 minutes everyday. After some time you can then constantly improve from there. 

You can do the same approach with food - start with one home cooked meal a week, then two, then three, and so on.

Honestly, where you start doesn't matter at all in the long term, it will have absolutely no effect - AS LONG as you step by step improve constantly. I found this subreddit very helpful here r/HabitExchnage which describes many habits you can adopt.
