I think that Disney already realises that Star Wars was an underused property considering they’ve made what 6 movies and a tv show in the past 5 years? 

Which is why they bought it in the first place?

In any case you didn’t read the article:

> The regulation comes in three un-American guises: permitting, code and tariffs — and together they are killing the U.S. residential market. Modernizing these regulations, primarily at the local and state level, is the greatest opportunity for U.S. solar policy in 2018.

>To highlight the opportunity, let’s look at Australia, where nearly 2 million solar systems have been successfully and safely installed.

> In Australia, there is no permitting process. You simply lodge your request for interconnection online and go install it. The figure below highlights the relative mass of valueless work required to satisfy current city-level bureaucracy in the U.S."
