cats,ffru3ir,t3_eus5cd,1580165856.0,Please please please be patient!! It can take time for a kitty like her to feel safe. Make sure to give her lots of places where she can feel safe like a covered bed and a cozy blanket in her carrier. If she keeps going outside the litter box you can try using Dr Elseys cat attract litter. That can help. Or they sell attractant to put in existing litter as well. Give her time and reassurance and she will come around! Don’t give up! She needs you.

AmItheAsshole,feapvwd,t3_eo6j73,1578951189.0,"YTA 
You have a lot of other comments here so mine will most likely get lost. I am adopted, and NOTHING and NO ONE will ever replace my mother as my mother. HOWEVER biologically I belong somewhere else. I am sorry but this is the reality of adoption. The first time I met my biological family I was floored at how much of me matched my biological family without ever even having met these people. They are a part of me and I am a part of them. SO much stuff made sense to me after meeting them. I now had an answer to so many questions that I had wondered about my whole life. This being said, I am the same race and the same culture in both families. I cannot even imagine coming from a different culture and a different race. 
You are the asshole because this isn’t about you at all. This is about your daughter finding out more about herself. It doesn’t mean she loves you and less and it doesn’t mean you love her any less. It’s just the reality of adoption. Biologically your daughter came from somewhere else and she has every right to explore that and learn about her family. By not wanting her to go or not being supportive you are shutting out a portion of herself. It’s not fair to her AT ALL. You should absolutely support her 100%. 
I can tell you as an adoptee, that not supporting her will probably result in resentment on her part. I cannot speak for her as I don’t know how she feels. But I know that I would feel resentful of my mother if she tried to block my biological family from me. Please tread carefully and realize this has absolutely nothing to do with you."

It shoots it into your bottom and sorta falls out from there. Then you can adjust yourself and wash your vag area, or if you have one like mine there’s a separate spray. So nothing from the butt area actually gets forcefully shoved into the vag area."

AskNYC,fe07t1i,t3_enfkw6,1578805363.0,"You have some great advice here but I am also going to come in and talk about sticker shock. You mentioned affordable and best in the same sentence. Those two things do not come together in NYC. You can live in Park Slope, Brooklyn or on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, but you’re going to pay a fortune in rent and in daycare. Not to mention what others have said about the waitlists. These are a real thing in the daycares you want your kid to go to. Nannies are a real thing too and you can hire one. I am a good, experienced nanny and I make 52,000 a year. You can get one for less but you get what you pay for. Trust me on that. You may THINK you have great daycare or a great nanny until you find out you don’t.  
Just know that living here is expensive. Living in a highly kid friendly area is going to be even more expensive. It’s no joke and it’s no easy thing to deal with."
