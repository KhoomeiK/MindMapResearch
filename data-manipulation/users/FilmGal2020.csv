Just because he seems like he can process that information doesn’t mean he had the cognitive and emotional capacity to do that. Next time ask parents before you show a minor R-rated content."
DepressionRecovery,ffhkaon,t3_et6si5,1579939184.0,Have you been checked for Lyme or Bartonella bacteria?
DepressionRecovery,fffrdya,t3_et6si5,1579890146.0,"Why do you assume it’s the depression? Have you checked your iron, magnesium, B-levels? Have you been checked for Bartonella and Lyme disease? Doctors are quick to say “Oh it’s depression” but you might have a solvable physical problem."
Filmmakers,ffdyazg,t3_esyyes,1579831950.0,Start marketing your film the way a distributor would. Sounds like you’re doing better than you think. Think of opportunities for advertising to send people to the platform
Filmmakers,ffdxwsg,t3_et2vme,1579831668.0,Well done!!!!!
lymedisease,fepiyaq,t3_epf56y,1579321699.0,Canada is super behind on Lyme treatment. I may need to go abroad
lymedisease,fem8k73,t1_felqnzd,1579243686.0,They won’t take blood here to send to the states for testing :(
lymedisease,fem8irs,t1_felvvj3,1579243640.0,"How can they say no to Western Blot but yea to Elisa? The test says do Elisa and if positive Western Blot.

I’ve had symptoms for years but getting really bad now.

We don’t have Lyme doctors and no infectious d doctors"
Filmmakers,fem8fdh,t3_epib8j,1579243533.0,Then I would get an external audio recorder for your audio and maybe a Lavalier mic

So the Igenex urine test isn’t accurate?"
lymedisease,felee5j,t1_fele4b2,1579220214.0,Yes I have all those things but i’m scared that my doctor won’t give me treatment if my Elisa is negative next week. I’m in Canada
lymedisease,fejt0rq,t1_fejr7sz,1579185132.0,Mind your business then
Filmmakers,fejsbzr,t3_epib8j,1579184641.0,"I wouldn’t use the g7, esp if you’re looking to do autofocus. I would suggest a zoom recorder and a decent sennheiser shotgun mic. If you can swing a blackmagic 4k with a decent lens, that will get you super pro looking video with some color correction but i’m not sure if you’re ready to handle raw?"
lymedisease,fejqwgk,t1_fejl1p5,1579183596.0,"I want to know what’s wrong with me. So yes, I want a diagnosis so I can start healing."
Filmmakers,fedya4p,t1_fdzxk3j,1579022440.0,"We don’t have that in North America. It’s a very different process. When looking for Private investment here, it’s suggested you make a good pitch of the feature with maybe a sizzle reel of pre-existing footage from other projects"
Filmmakers,fdzvqce,t1_fdzdeva,1578796936.0,"If you’re looking for financing, they won’t care if u did Shorts. I’m in the same position of trying to get my first Feature financed.

Even though I have a varied set of award winning Shorts time and time again I hear they only trust directors that have been able to make a longer length project."
Filmmakers,fdz9yt2,t1_fdvhbx5,1578788107.0,DM me if interested. I know streaming services that will pay if distributed
Filmmakers,fdz9s4m,t1_fdyj4zk,1578788045.0,"I heard it’s rarely a good idea to shoot a short as a proof of concept because the feature will be so different from budget to cinematography (better lenses and cameras), it can backfire"
Filmmakers,fdz8y60,t3_en73gq,1578787851.0,That’s amazing! Congratations. Art and filmmaking are possible at any age and any stage. Well done!
lymedisease,fdyst53,t3_endh0x,1578783230.0,PS Vast majority of doctors are uneducated or lack current up to date knowledge of lyme. Fight for your health!!!  Good luck
lymedisease,fdyso6v,t3_endh0x,1578783185.0,"It sounds like you definitely have Lyme and don’t listen to doctors that say you can only get it from a Tick. That’s not true. You can get it from infected horseflies and other vectors. Watch this.

Every symptoms you’ve stated suggests Lyme. Get a test and second test even if the first is negative."
Screenwriting,fdt066j,t3_emvtkl,1578710217.0,Amazing. I love when people are REAL.
lymedisease,fdspa0l,t1_fdpjuqf,1578706185.0,Anti inflammatories are steroids. Steroids do something to rouse the bacteria and worsen things
lymedisease,fdpjndl,t3_emctrc,1578630437.0,Don’t let them give him steroids for inflammation. Giving steroids to anyone with Lyme causes a lot of problems.
lymedisease,fdo2p9x,t3_emctrc,1578597796.0,How did they test your dog for Lyme and what kind of treatment are they giving him?
lymedisease,fdm6r7v,t1_fdlspqy,1578541172.0,Where have you seen these? I have seen mostly positive reviews. Pls post a link.
lymedisease,fdkyeze,t3_elqxgk,1578513725.0,"It definitely sounds like Lyme. I wouldn’t rely on antibiotics you get through non specialists of Lyme. Because it sounds like it’s in your joints now, maybe even central nervous system. Check out the Envita website in Scottsdale. Don’t delay treatment! Congratulations for figuring this out. Spread the word!"
cinematography,fdfp88n,t1_fdflqs1,1578366922.0,I suggest you study off YouTube. You can get yourself in debt real fast if you don’t know what you’re buying or why you need it. You can make a short film with your iphone camera. Figure out why you want to start buying things. Or hire people to shoot a short film and make sure they own their equipment.
cinematography,fdflg9z,t3_el4j53,1578364444.0,Your price for what?
CanadaLyme,fdf8ddv,t1_fdf6zm9,1578355680.0,Yes but it is hopeful and maybe worth trying some of the herbal forms of the identified specimens.

depression,fcoeabq,t1_fcod959,1577830137.0,Yes. You may think you haven’t had a choice but we all have choices. Be happy you’re alone tonight because I guarantee you if you observe closely most people are going to end the night angry and disappointed.
depression,fcod1ee,t1_fcocxug,1577829252.0,It’s far worst to feel lonely in a crowded room.
depression,fcocyra,t1_fco2p3p,1577829202.0,Ummmm yes. You should be able to be happy alone.
depression,fcocv26,t1_fco2v7k,1577829130.0,Let me tell you...I have tons of friends and none of them were there for me when I needed them. Be there for yourself. That’s the most important friendship you will have.
