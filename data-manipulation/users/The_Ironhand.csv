apexlegends,fffkhcu,t3_et9de0,1579885916.0,"What if you could lay it down and save it as a trap. Detonate when you're ready, but make it like up to 25-30 seconds to auto detonate.  Seeing those Bangalore traps and pushing into them trying to kill her before she sets em off sounds cool. Lower damage, increase the smokiness.

Can also be quick detonated to be used as normal. Would give some range to how you could use it, while giving people the quick timed use if they need that to

Edit: caustic should ignite all active caustic barrels like scorches gas flame for his super.

Why doesn't he use fire with his god damn gas respawn? Shit would be so cool(I'm already seeing how this would be abused fml)"
