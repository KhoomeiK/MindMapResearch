We've got 1 year maternity leave which most people take and then either come back early or start working part time before it finishes. Most women who work before they have kids, in a job they enjoy find suddenly having their sense of purpose and social life taken away to wipe arses, incredibly difficult. Not to say that raising a child isn't satisfying in its own way, but it's not enough for most women and that is a hugely taboo thing to admit."

Our local farmers market has super strict rules that ban any non-food items being sold and food has to be grown locally or made locally with minimum 50% local produce. It's constantly winning awards and mentioned in travel magazines because the quality is so high and it attracts people who are community minded and want to support local growers.

Because building strong social networks, talking about emotions, and valuing non-sexual touch are seen as ""feminine"", men often don't develop the coping strategies or support networks to see them through difficult life events.
This doesn't mean an individual like your friend is fragile, it means the traditional concept of masculinity is fragile, because it doesn't provide men with the tools they need to live emotionally satisfying and rich lives. I just saw a bunch of bigoted old bitches in the crafting community hound a male crocheter into cancelling a beautiful project he'd created because he didn't live up to their ideas of maleness or perform the kind of activities they deemed suitable for a man.
