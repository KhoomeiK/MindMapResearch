* Clean diet (avoid sugar, wheat and processed food) and drink plenty of water throughout the day

This sounds a lot like how I operate and why I discovery write. When I come up with stuff I never put them down, because every time I've done that it somehow kills the idea and guarantees it will never be used. I keep it in my head, vague, and I let it simmer there. It might change shape or I might discard it, but I keep it there mostly as a source of inspiration.

It's never just a few games to chill and have fun (which is what I remember it to be when I don't play for a while), instead it spreads like a cancer and I struggle to focus on my work, relationships and any other activities (like reading, socializing) for my mind is being pulled to the game, thinking how can I improve, what will I try to play today after I get off work, what mistakes I made to cause us to lose that game last night, etc. I forget how it makes me not to want to do anything besides playing the game and everything else in my life which I love becomes a chore to get over with so I can go play.

So how did I get the courage to delete it? I used the anger and revulsion after the last binge to write to Riot support. That was fairly easy; the hard part was to wait 30 days for the account to be actually deleted and not write to them to cancel the process. I won't lie, I did consider it but I was resolute in my decision because I still could remember how I felt at the end of the binge. I don't remember anymore and have had pretty intense cravings. I notice how my mind keeps trying to negotiate to give it a go again and fuck does it sound reasonable in its arguments. Luckily I'm so busy at the moment I literally don't have time to play even one game, although on the flip-side it has brought along the stress which makes me want to escape to League again.

One day at a time. I hope you find your source of power to do the hard thing. It'll absolutely help you to stay off the game and you probably need to go for it at some point to move on and upgrade your life. Remember that you have actually achieved *nothing*, absolutely nothing by having all the champs, skins and ranks. They are not transferable to anything of value, they have no worth outside the game.

Yeah, I've pretty much come to the same conclusion. Natural inclination toward something is nice (and quite real), but I think what truly matters is your level of interest toward the subject. Painfully often people mistake someone who's passionate for someone talented; hell, I used to be unable to tell if someone sang off-pitch (I remember watching shows like American Idol as a kid and couldn't tell if someone sang well or not - really, most sounded fine to me and it puzzled me when they got laughed at), or hear when my guitar was out of tune, and it took me two years of practicing before I actually heard the dissonance when something's not in tune. That was over a decade and a half ago, and I've many times been called talented and it kind of irks me that people think talent had any part in it.

selfimprovement,fc2rfux,t3_efe37n,1577371847.0,"Don't pursue happiness; pursue meaning. Happiness will come along, but don't expect it to always be there. A meaningful life is hard: it means you actually have to work hard to pursue what really matters to you, what would make your life worth living. In the meantime you should ask yourself what kind of a person do you want to be? What are the qualities that in your eyes make someone admirable and virtuous? Strive to be that person in every action you take and each action will take you closer to being that person. We are not our thoughts; we are what we repeatedly do.

There's a little vulnerable child inside all of us. We might grow up and toughen up in many ways, but all of us have that child inside that yearns to be understood, held and cared for. Growing up doesn't mean that the child is gone, instead it means that *you* are now responsible for taking care of that child. When you understand this, you understand what it is to love oneself: it's the act of taking care of yourself like you would take care of someone you deeply cared for. Would you let that person eat junk food weekly for years? Would you let them go on for years without exercising? Would you let them stick to a job that makes them miserable and not encourage them to pursue that thing they secretly wished to do but dare not because it's hard and risky and they are just not good enough? Would you not try to understand and console them when they feel angry or hurt, or do something stupid?

Love won't *ever* come from a place of lacking and is not to be confused with pity, sympathy or empathy. Love comes as a response to the overflow of your virtue. When you have set yourself straight and are on the right path in life, then will you be ready to accept love when it comes. Be a person worthy of loving.

Go on dates (it has never been easier than on this day and age) to have fun, meet new people and improve yourself. Take each encounter as a challenge and a chance for your personal growth. Stop seeking someone to fill up a void in you, that's not asking for love but for a caretaker, and that's unfair to ask of anyone unless you're going to pay them.
