Yang, Tulsi and primarily Warren were the obvious choices available that would do that, but Warrens gone full kamikaze. 

Both Yang and Tulsi appeal to independents that will prove crucial in the general. Yang is a nice guy, second most liked candidate at the moment, i believe, whereas Tulsi is the least favourable.

That said, a Bernie/Tulsi ticket would be an absolute monster for winning over independents and right leaners. If the BNMW crew really mean what they say they should fall in line, so we dont need to take a moderate or a centrist as a VP for party unity's sake.

Then there are superdelegates for each state who vote independently of the voters, though in some states the are bound to vite for the state winner. Previously, superdelegates could declare pre-convention but this time around they can only declare on the second ballot, should no clear candidate win in the first ballot by getting 50% plus.

The remarks have damaged her personally along with her career prospects. Hillary is not an active politician, holds no office, is not a direct political opponent in any present or upcoming race. I mean, I expect Hilldog will win any case brought forth because she has friends in all the right places and a heavy duty legal team, but Tulsi is right to try.

SandersForPresident,feo9gmc,t1_feo13x5,1579296923.0,"Warren doesnt need money to stay in, she needs strong performance at the polls. If she fell below the threshold in Iowa, and came 3rd or 4th in NH, NV and SC, her path to nomination disappears. If she has the decency, she will bow out at this point. If she wants to be difficult and stay in, her support is likely to collapse because nobody bets on a lame horse.

Buttigeig also depends on the same route to nomination as Bernie and Warren. Should he fail to claim a win before SC, his path also vanishes, he has the worst ST prospects on tier 1 so theres literally nothing left for him. Mayo might also bow out, if thats the case. Biden doesnt *need* any of the first three to win, but it severely harms his core electability argument if he doesnt. If were in a two horse race by ST and Bernie has buzz, biden looks like a loser, then  those southern contests become a lot closer. If biden doesnt have a biiig lead voming out the otherside of ST, the race swings into territories where Bernie has the upper hand. In short, Joe needs to be the clear leader by a good margin after ST or he'll also start to fragment.

Yang and Tulsi have all their hopes pinned on the early contests, too. Failure to cause an upset in Iowa and NH for them will probably see them withdraw, and theyll likely throw in with Bernie over anyone else. Steyer has crossover support with Bernie but he has a few ST states in his sights. A bad ST for him will probably see him come behind the sanders candidacy. Bloomberg is treating ST as his primary target, which hurts Biden over anybody else.

Of all the other candidates, Klob is the most likely to hold on until convention. She has her best states *after* ST, so shes just got to keep afloat til then. If Bernie gets some wins and Biden starts to flake, she will be hoping to collect up his disaffected supporters. That could mean a convention where progressives have united on Sanders while centrists have split between Joe, Bloombito and Amy.

In any fandom, the readers are purists who shit on anything that isnt the glorious source material. 

""Where the hell is young griff?!"" 

""Why did they write out Peeves the Poltergeist?""

""Theyre seriously going to cut the scouring of the shire?!""


Guess what? When the medium changes, other things change too. Each retelling stands on its own feet and makes its own creative choices. Each one will potentily resonate with a different audience. Thats okay.

Ive almost always been a book purist in all my fandoms. I read ASOIAF, LotR/Hobbit and HP before i watched them, and am excited to see a number of my other series hit the screen such as Dark Materials (havent had a chance to watch yet) and Asimov's Foundation. I know that there will be changes. I wont agree with some of them, and thats okay. The important thing about a new medium is a new audience, and I hope that they enjoy the world(s) on their own terms. 

Witcher is the exception for me. I havent had time to read the books yet. As a new father, it will probably be a couple of years until i have the time. I played the games (a little of 2 and a little more of 3) and did not like them. At all. Geralt really rubbed me up the wrong way. When i heard that a TV series was coming, I thought it was going to be bloody awful. Since release, the gamers seem to hate it because its not the game and the readers seem to hate it because its not the book. Nonetheless, theres a strong core of admirers online, so I thought i would give it a go. With a newborn, watching TV is a lot easier than my usually preferred mediums.

I really enjoyed it. Is it faultless? Of course not. Theres plenty of room for improvement. But it is also deserving of that chance to grow. Its core cast deliver very well- i was amazed to find that I actually *like* Geralt- it has some really great moments and has a firm feel and tone that will hopefully be the cornerstone of its identity going forwards. 

Long story short; let the show be the show. For me, this has been my portal into this universe. I didnt like the games and without a positive association would probably have skipped the books. Now, ive borrowed the game and added the books to my reading list. There will be many more new fans just like me, who have bought into the universe from this portrayal. Welcome them."

europe,fcy5c8r,t1_fcx1j4f,1578075043.0,"We should take a leaf out of the ottoman book.

After multiple failed invasions against the technologically and culturally inferior Europeans, the ottomans switched to a containment policy. Ottoman fleets in the med kept the europeans from expanding, be it trade or conquest, by sea. Ottoman armies in the balkans stood against any expansion by land. The europeans were left to stew.

The result? Without  a common and overbearing enemy to unite them, dissatisfaction grew against the opulent clergy that dominated european politics, and the feudal system which upheld their power. Scientific development rebounded in renaissance Italy, spreading out across christendom. Spiritual revolution followed in Germany with the rise of Protestantism and a wave of revolutionary wars and reform movements changed the political game forever. In trade, European ships were forced to look further afield to escape ottoman hegemony, establishimng new markets around the world.  A flourishing merchant class demanded greater power and had the capital to do so. A new and industrious era of european civilization was birthed and would go on to dominate and reshape the world.

The muslim world is in need of its own Martin Luther moment. Their past is littered with scientists and explorers, thinkers and doers, and it can be so again. All that is required is an opportunity for the people to see their true enemy clearly, and seize their future with their own hands."

WayOfTheBern,fcmwckc,t1_fcmvcwi,1577795258.0,"You are not listening. I dont know how much clearer i can be in making the distinction between defending something and understanding how living populations justify their misdeeds. At the time of slavery, there were people who defended and believed in slavery. Many southern americans were willing to die for it. It was normalised to them. 

Slavery is indefensible. That doesnt mean that people havent *tried* to defend it, that at the time of its perpetration people didnt actively defend it, and in the past they found a more receptive audience amongst the general population than they would today.

This isnt about the legality or the perception under international or domestic law. Its about how these actions were perceived amongs  the populace and why the authorities of the time deemed it necessary, and also how they rationalised their actions ti the people and to themselves. Neither internment nor slavery were just done for shits and giggles, and that internment was pursued despite the known ethical and legal positions
 to the contrary shows that those responsible believed that history would see the wisdom of their actions. As it is, we see the folly of them instead."
WayOfTheBern,fcmvdy5,t1_fcmsibk,1577794054.0,"I dont think you are understanding what i am saying. I am explaining how the people of the time justified their actions to themselves, not that those justifications are valid. We are in a position today to analyse out historic crimes and denounce them, just as our successors will look harshlt on the injistices of our time, which to us (as a collective) may seem permissable and rational. There are no leaders or governments in all of history that have not been party to their own great crimes, and all will have found a way to justify themselves and normalise their atrocities."
WayOfTheBern,fcmv5qz,t1_fcmr9me,1577793760.0,"I think perhaps you ought to read what I said. From where we are today, you are right to call out FDR. What he did was absolutely a war crime. What i am saying is to the population and authorities of the time, they thought there was a justification which we are smart enough to see through today.  A big part of why we are having this conversation now is because over the last seventy years we have as a society become much more aware of the injustices and crimes of our forebears."
WayOfTheBern,fcmqz6r,t1_fcmpbil,1577787885.0,"Everything must be viewed through the lenses of time and human fallibility.

It was a bad solution but it wasnt until *after* the war, when the true potential evil that camps could bring was revealed in occupied germany, that the wider process of internment was held to real ethical scrutiny and found wanting."

Passages describe ""monkey men"" from other planets invading ours, flying metal cities that hover in orbit, ""chariots of fire"" that carry men about the sky, brahamastra, or ""creation weapons"" that turn cities to glass in a single strike with great smokeclouds like parasols opening up, which sicken and poison the land for miles around as soldiers burn with invisible fire, losing their nails, hair and teeth. Sounds like an interplanetary nuclear war essentially, only 4000 or more years ago.

 Odd thing is, the place where its set, the indus vally, sports a series of well designed city ruins, with in house plumbing and higher than natural levels of radiation, corpses left in the strreet as though they met a sudden end. South of these ruins lies the rajpootana desert, a wasteland despite otherwise relatively favourable climate and geography, and area with way higher-than-average mutations per population, including the 8 legged cattle and childern you occasionally see pictures of.
