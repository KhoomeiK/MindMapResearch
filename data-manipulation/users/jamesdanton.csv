AlfaRomeo,fd6kl5y,t1_fd2j0eq,1578192415.0,"I service my cars religiously. It made no difference. Between being told I had 'lifetime transmission fluid', I didn't need to break my new car in and that they reason they are revving the nut off my V10 M5 was to 'clear the cylinders of debris' after a spark plug change. It was when I was AT BMW that I had the most problems and I can even show you documents to back what I'm saying. 

For example, one dealer pulled the plug out of the back of the NAV unit in the boot of my E38 740il. Told me it was a $3K fix and half the rear of the car would need to be pulled out. Luckily I knew they systems back to front and checked for myself. Oh, look, someone has pulled the antenna cable out. Someone who knows what they're doing. Someone who wants to profit. 

And when the cars broke down it would be due to the plastic junk they use on BMW's, (expansion tanks, ducts, sensor housings, etc.) transmission failure for automatics (which I found out from a man at ZF that the boxes are tested and are DESIGNED to fail around the 120,000km mark if the fluid isn't changed or the car is babied every day of it's life) or from a leak in the housing of the three year old SMG in my M5...that happened and was fixed three times. 

My Alfa's, especially the GTA's, EAT suspension components so it's links and wishbones every two years. Apart from that, just regular lubes. Same with my Honda's, same with my Lexus's, same with my Volvo P1800. No issues. I would never darken BMW's door step ever again.
