curlyhair,feidozd,t1_feid0uh,1579136095.0,"before i got my hair cut a few months ago it looked nothing like these pictures since i destroyed my hair with straightening from middle school until that cut(i'm graduated from highschool now). i also bleached it myself 2 times to try and do my own ombré. my boyfriends mom is a hairdresser and she referred to it as the end of a broom/straw. it used to be just frizz. so she cut it and did some long layers, when i left the salon those loose spirals were everywhere but they didn't last as you can see. i think she did something magical that day or something"
curlyhair,fefqmgq,t1_fefqgmp,1579062407.0,thanks! and the only things in my house are like leave in conditioners and oil serums and hairspray. so i haven't ever tried gel or anything. do you have any brand recommendations?
dogs,fefpqe8,t1_fee1cwa,1579061738.0,"i'm a pet sitter/house sitter and thinking about getting into the training field since most clients are puppies that can't stay home alone and i love them especially when we create a bond over time. but i can agree puppies are huge jerks. they're demanding, energetic, very veryyyyy playful. when i used to spend 9 hours with this one puppy i sit (i do half days with her now) i can admit i got frustrated a few times. but i started to realize what they listen to and don't listen to. i noticed that if you chase them around when they have your socks, yell at them, try to take things out of their mouth, it's the MOST FUN GAME IN THE WORLD. so you have to approach differently. turn your back, don't give them the attention they desperately want, and they'll end up dropping whatever they're doing and focus on getting your attention back because you're the leader and they want you to know they're there. but jeez i love that puppy even tho she's a dick to me. i've been in her life since she was 4 months old and now she's coming up on 9 :')"
cfs,fefio2r,t1_feca3be,1579057126.0,"i used to be the most active person ever. i'd ride my bike everyday, my city has this sunday night bike ride, started with a couple of kids and then it became a big thing where hundreds of people meet up at midnight and everyone just drinks, does drugs and ride bikes all over the city until 5 am. we'd go super far, we'd bike like 20 minutes, have a 10 minute stop, bike again for a half hour. over and over. i did this for a whole summer until i started feeling like this. i haven't been able to find the energy to do that again for 2 years. when i go to my friends houses how i sit and then end up laying down. walking around is very tiring but i can still get things done you know? like honestly i'll be fine when i'm walking but it's more when i stop walking i get hit with this heavy body feeling"
cfs,fefi596,t1_fed7x0l,1579056810.0,"i can relate to both of those. i do feel it in my joints and bones, my body just overall always feels tired and doesn't wanna move. like some days i wake up and it just feels like gravity is pushing me into the bed so i can't get up. everything feels so heavy, like the air around me is pushing me down. my leg was hurting so bad earlier and that happens often i always think i have juvenile arthritis. it's always the left one i'm not sure why but it feels like my bone is just disintegrating or being rubbed down with sandpaper."
curlyhair,fefhjhy,t3_eow322,1579056454.0,"my current routine is really nothing. i wash my hair with redken hair cleaning cream shampoo, tresemme conditioner because i recently ran out of the redken conditioner. sometimes i scrunch it with a t shirt. i don't really touch my hair while it's drying  after it dries because i lose my waves if i do it's super tricky so no products like leave ins for me they end up just making my hair go flat. they lose definition fast too, the left picture is my hair as it's drying and the second is the next morning. if you guys can help me figure it out that'd be great because hair quizzes are confusing and i don't really know how to answer the questions and i've looked at hair type charts but they all look different."
cfs,fec8cox,t1_fec75hp,1578968422.0,damn you're right i really am downplaying the vision problems and nearly fainting. i shouldnt think of that as normal. i guess i just gotten used to it and thought everyone gets that time to time especially since it only lasts a few seconds and i'm good afterwards. like i have friends who've gotten light headed from standing up and i just thought it was normal. but that's when they stand up fast. not walking down the stairs. and i should recognize that thanks for pushing me to not ignore/brush that off :) i love how supportive people are on here
cfs,fec6h25,t1_fec4f2j,1578967449.0,"yes. the only thing i can really say i don't experience is sitting/standing up worsening symptoms. like i do feel better laying in my bed but i don't feel WAY worse when standing or anything. i do have a history of my vision going almost black and running to my bed to lay down, or getting very dizzy with head pain when i stand up. there's times i would just walk down the stairs and it feels like something starts pushing down on my head, i get fuzzy vision and i have to stop walking and close my eyes and kinda bend over, but i mean i can definitely still walk around once that passes though and it's not consistent throughout the day unless i'm going from sitting to standing. i hope this makes sense. let me know if i misunderstood that symptom."
cfs,fec2riq,t1_febzqcj,1578965819.0,"well depression can have physical symptoms such as feeling fatigued, excessive sleep. many diseases can be masked by the label depression, a common one is bipolar it goes undiagnosed for so long cuz doctors will think ""your depression can be less bad some days"" until it gets worse. my mental health also has me feeling drained most days so maybe i can't really tell when i have that pem crash cuz it just feels like a more exhausting day and i brush it off? if that makes sense. cuz if you never really feel ""good"" it can probably be hard to tell when you feel extremely bad"
cfs,fec19m9,t1_febriuq,1578965178.0,i haven't really kept track of that to realize and don't really remember the last time i exercised. i also have anxiety so when my mind is spinning or i have too many people talking at once or let's say rushing me out of the house i do feel super drained after all that mind work like sometimes arguments with my boyfriend will leave me unable to talk afterwards bc i just shut down but i think that could be the rise and fall of stress  possibly. idk it's hard to tell what makes me feel worse when my mental health always makes me feel bad you know? i cant really pinpoint anything :/
cfs,feboo54,t1_febmku4,1578961054.0,"thank you this information did help i'll try that out! i actually have a friend who says she has cfs and the reason i feel like it's more than depression is 1. other people i know with depression still possess more energy and motivation than me and 2. my friend with cfs is more energetic than me. i know this is just assumption though and i really shouldn't say i have it worse than others since you can't see the illness they have. i just notice that she can clearly do more than me, like when she wants to party i usually dont. but she's probably just good at hiding it."
cfs,febntzu,t1_febmlcz,1578960831.0,"yeah i'm not trying to self diagnose myself or anything it's just these symptoms being labeled as depression just seems whack to me. i know a lot of people with depression and they're not half as tired, lightheaded, etc as me and i've gotten into many fights w friends and family when i'd sleep most of my day away. i definitely have lost interest in things, but there are times where i really do want to do stuff and i'll plan a week of friend time and fun but then when the day comes i just want to stay home bc when i lay down i do NOT have the energy to get up. i literally get angry sometimes when i have to get up. like fuming. because it feels like there's weights holding down my body."
dogs,fdwrcwi,t1_fdshsaa,1578761589.0,"yeah genetics and breed probably play a role. the one puppy i dogsit loves to eat anything she can get her mouth on much like your spaniel lol, she eats leaves and i've had to chase her to get dryer sheets out of her mouth. she loves anything that she can swallow. my dog looks at her like she's crazy."
dogs,fdwqgxq,t1_fdwp5lx,1578761375.0,"yeah! i have a lab and you'd think he would be food obsessed since labs are prone to overeating and obesity, he's also a rescue tho. the original owner didn't have enough time to take care of all 3 pups she had anymore because she was moving out of her ex's house, he came here with fur that was literally greasy. his color and weight changed so much when he came here. so maybe he got used to waiting around for food? he's super beta so i think he let his old family dogs walk all over him if they were alpha, maybe stole his food sometimes. this one puppy that used to come to my house for my job is an australian shepherd/border collie mix and when i would try to feed my dog i'd have to hold her back because she would cry and try to run to his bowl even when she had already eaten the lunch the people packed for her. and when he was done she would go lick the leftover meat juice/search for any crumbs she could fine as if she was starving to death. she would also eat a piece of banana like it was prime rib."
mentalhealth,fdll324,t1_fdlk9m5,1578526447.0,"yeah i drink alcohol more often than my stoner friends, probably once or twice a week but nothing more than a few beers usually 3 or 4.  i don't really like hard alcohol, it always ends up getting me too drunk and i'm not a person who throws up, i just have crying meltdowns lmao. i prefer to be tipsy/drunk, not wasted, it does make me less anxious and numbs my scary thoughts which i like but it also makes me worry about developing dependency for it. i have heard about alcohol increasing anxiety though which should make me wanna stop but i know i won't hehe"
