TikTokCringe,fgsh0ay,t1_fgingge,1581084083.0,"TL:DR; The 40% number is wrong and plain old bad science. In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology.

The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. & Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states:

Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year.

There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study:

The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The “domestic violence” acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c

An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws:

The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago.

More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1862

Yet another study ""indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent)."" A.H.

Another: In a 1999 study, 7% of Baltimore City police officers admitted to 'getting physical' (pushing, shoving, grabbing and/or hitting) with a partner.

Ah, propaganda. The most accurate depiction of the truth.

>They signed up to fight for the freedom of the southern states. Independent almost-countries instead of serving Washington D.C. It wasn't about slavery to the individual soldier, not before or during the war. States rights and the freedom to determine their own rules would have been all that was discussed and yelled about in their camps.

I say again, ""their right to what, Steve?""

>So no, they weren't ""fighting to oppress others.""

They were fighting to maintain their right to oppress others. 

>You also have a comically weird mental image of slave-owners too. ""Evil doers"" who hate their slaves and get giddy at their torture and imprisonment. That isn't how it was, sorry to disappoint your justice boner with your black and white narrative. They liked their slaves no different than a man likes his horse. They were property and many slave owners took pride in their property. It was racist as fuck obviously, but still, the average owner didn't beat slaves for a fun past time.

I'm sorry, but they're kind of easy to hate. I'm sure members of the Imperial Japanese army loved their country, but that doesn't make what unit 731 did fine.

Also, to continue your pet analogy, people also abuse animals. They torture their dogs for fun. I'm also of the opinion that even if they didn't, it still wouldn't matter. Black people are people, and deserved better than to be treated like beasts of burden. The fact that they kept slaves, in and of itself, makes them evil doers.

Well it sounds like the VA office hasn't changed. And you really think the average northerner gave a shit about the political side of this? That they were all in on some grand plot to centralize power with the elites? If they didn't care about slavery they wouldn't have signed up."

>The slave owners hated their own slaves?

Yes, obviously.

They loved that they *had* slaves. Not the slaves themselves. If you love someone you don't force them to work outside in southern heat all day without pay.

>Like reeeally loved them. 

Explaines the rape, I guess

>But the average southern soldier? Hated them, sure. Hated them for stealing well paying jobs

That they weren't being paid for? Makes sense.

 > [...] hated their owners for being rich while they were poor too. Same with today's class struggle.
Did the average poor southern care about slaves being chains? Big fucking no, unless they were some weird supremacist who didn't even have slaves. The rest of them probably supported free slaves because it would mean better paying jobs for the average white man. Either that or they supported freeing them and sending them right back to Africa. They were racist obviously, but the poor man absolutely did not want to compete with a slave of all people.

If this were true, there would be linch mobs for the bourgeoisie and northerners after the war.

>But what they didn't support? Them not getting to vote on it. When a central government akin to revolutionary war UK invades from the North to take away their states rights, they will absolutely fight. With morale that shook fear into Union armies in every initial victory for the south.

The allusions to the war of independence don't really work so well when the freedom you're fighting for is to oppress others. Also, how is this the slave's problem? 

>The ONLY people supporting slaves in chains would be the hated fat cat land owners who got rich off of them. Everyone else was getting off the train at a pretty steady rate.

So in your theory, thousands of fighting age men who are angry at the rich slave owners decided to fight for them when given the opportunity to take away the source of their immense wealth? Makes sense.

>But if that happened, states rights would have been intact. The federal government wouldn't have the power it wanted to hold. So what better way to destroy states rights than start a war over slavery, which was heading out the door anyway?

>I know it's a little tinfoily, but the anti-federalists(Federal supporters) gained a lot of power from the war, power they had wanted for a very long time. Power they would have done anything to get. Blacks were in the gutter as if they hadn't ever been saved in the first place, the Anti-Federalists didn't give a shit about them. If you believed the war was to ""save the poor black peoples,"" the evidence of that being a lie is all over after the war. They treated them like shit, North and South. They wanted a strong central government and they got it.

That is generally how winning a war works, yes. Do you think that if the south had won that they wouldn't form a strong central government to make sure that the north couldn't rise again? 

If the political climate really was the way you say it was, the southern masses would band together against the rich long before the Union army could be raised."
trashy,fggilfe,t1_fgggwfj,1580762626.0,">You seem to think the war improved the slaves situation. It absolutely didn't.

I disagree. The American rallying cry is freedom, and freedom they got. Besides, if being freed wouldn't improve their lives, why did a bunch of former slaves go back with the northerners to fight?

>Depending on people who now hated them.

Get real, they hated them before.

>They suffered from the war just as the south did, they were the south after all. As much you cheer for the south being ""beaten up,"" it was the slaves that got beaten with it, so think about that for a moment. They lived there too. You are thinking like a Northerner. ""We did it we saved the day"" as they walk away from a burning wreck, slaves starving in the street begging for food.

Again, better to scrape together a life on the street than a life on a plantation.

>There would absolutely be division, but it would be MUCH less. There would be benevolence instead of a history of resistance to freeing the slaves.

You're making a shot in the dark, and I still don't think it would've been worth it.

Even though sharecropping may as well be the definition of wage slavery, considering they used to be literal slaves, this isn't really a downgrade.

>Decades of reconstruction, wasted resources and taxes. 

Sucks to suck, see my first point. 

>A legacy of division between white and black that would last until today. Think of the social progress that would have been done if it was a democratic vote? Right then and there the civil rights would have started, right off the bat.

So your argument is that allowing the south to continue to treat people like farm equipment for an indeterminate amount of time could be made up to those people by a marginal improvement afterwards? I don't buy it.

>The only people who believed it urgent were those who would get an upper hand politically and economically. They didn't care about the plight of the slaves.

Except the slaves, of course. I imagine they weren't thrilled with the situation.

>It wasn't urgent. Rushing it caused more problems than it solved and the deathtoll wasn't worth the prize. That division and resentment against the central government will never go away.
