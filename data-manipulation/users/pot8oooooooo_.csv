quityourbullshit,ffdbtwe,t1_ffczzr1,1579817535.0,I laugh but I’m currently on my phone at work because illustrator crashed when I tried to move some text around.
dogs,ffbyuna,t1_ffbyptw,1579787089.0,Yeah I’ve been thinking about a coat for him I’ll just have to look into what sort of coat would work.

AdviceAnimals,ff99290,t1_ff95182,1579707650.0,drivers insurance deemed it to be my fault...for being on a crosswalk?? Lawyers are involved now so we’ll see.
AdviceAnimals,ff944wm,t3_es5r6j,1579704391.0,"I went to the er and got charged $1000 for a nurse to literally wrap an ace bandage around my arm and leg and give me crutches. My total bill was $10,000 for the price of a ct scan and xrays. 10k. Fuck if I’d known nothing was broken after I got hit by a car i would of just crawled home.

Honest to god the ambulance driver saw I was a student (student id in wallet) he told me to call a friend to drive me to the hospital. He probably saved me another 8k to not ride two minutes in the wee-woo wagon. 

None of that 10k covered follow up visits too. I should of just crawled home and wrapped myself in bandages."
ArtistLounge,ff80h9j,t1_ff7wsl2,1579662793.0,On the one hand: yeah. On the other: not being able to draw/make what you want and instead making what other people want kinda sucks.
AskReddit,ff508fk,t1_ff48ho1,1579576756.0,"Listen I’ve eaten the same thing at Olive Garden for 10 years and I never intend to stop. Breadsticks, salad and plain fettuccine alfredo. Just carb it up and go into a food coma."
dogs,ff401qc,t1_ff3z6s2,1579552593.0,"He cries for between 5-60min and then he goes to sleep. I think you may be thinking he’s a 10/10 on the anxiety scale when he’s probably a 4/10. 

He’s a great dog otherwise. I’m not just going to trade him in for a different dog likes he’s a defective toy. I was adopted and my parents never shipped me back to the orphanage when I cried at preschool because I missed them. I’m not a dog but still. 

Baby gates don’t work because I have an open floor plan and again dog daycare is very expensive where I live. I would have to make a ridiculous amount of money to afford that. Some people do but those people are probably not recent college grads like me."
dogs,ff3ynzd,t1_ff3x9b4,1579551730.0,"When i was six my parents got a puppy. They had this puppy that I adored for only six weeks before they decided that they didn’t want him anymore and drove him right back to the breeder. And it broke my heart and I promised I’d never give up on a dog and just dump them back where they came from. 

Don’t you think it’s too early to just give up on my dog? Won’t he adjust over time?"
dogs,ff3x49e,t1_ff3wix1,1579550765.0,"Listen I hear ya. My dog and I both have anxiety. When I went to preschool the first time I cried and cried and it took me months to stop (according to my mom). So I sympathize with my guy. 

I just am concerned because neighbors are already complaining and I don’t know what I’ll do if my landlord gets wind as they’ll likely say to get my dog to stop. And it’s just not that simple."
dogs,ff3weaq,t1_ff3w3gg,1579550310.0,"He’s going to daycare once a week starting this week but it’s expensive so it’s all I can afford right now. 

My apartment has a very open layout. So I’d essentially need a fence to baby gate off the kitchen. I’m thinking about the bathroom but again, im afraid he’ll eat something he shouldn’t or scratch up/break up the door."
dogs,ff3vgsk,t1_ff3uznl,1579549732.0,Hound. 3. I know. The problem is I have to go to work and I have to go to sleep. So at home we could train to where he gets up to 2 minutes without crying. But then I go to sleep and he resets to like 30seconds.
dogs,ff3v55k,t1_ff3uogo,1579549530.0,He goes in willingly as he gets a treat. He doesn’t tolerate the crate for long. Maybe 10min while I’m there and like 1min if he can’t see me. Yesterday he was on the couch. I left to go to the bathroom. He could of gotten off the couch to go find me. Instead he cried.
dogs,ff3ucvn,t1_ff3u072,1579549040.0,He prefers laying literally on top of me on the couch. He’s not house broken and he has a problem eating non edible items so I haven’t tried leaving him out. I’m afraid he’ll scratch up or destroy my door as well.
MadeMeSmile,ff2wf9e,t1_ff1tr3c,1579526707.0,“My daughters painted it because they love me and I wear it cause I love them.” Who shits on a dude who has a strong and healthy relationship which his kids?
dogs,ff0o5e5,t1_ff0l4al,1579470686.0,He won’t even let me go to the bathroom alone. If I do he cries at the door. I’m enrolling him in half day daycare once a week so he can learn it’s okay not to be right next to me all the time. And once he’s house trained I’ll be able to relax and do some stuff I need to do around my house without worrying about what he’s up to.
millionairemakers,fepflk9,t3_eq81a8,1579319273.0,Good luck everyone!
dogs,femut7f,t1_femu8ko,1579270185.0,He’s not housebroken yet and he has issues eating foreign objects. We’re working on it but I had to pull three rocks out of his mouth today. So he’d be more likely to eat my bed than sleep on it. He’s also 4. But a former stray so we’re starting off like he’s a puppy as he’s not used to being an inside dog.
dogs,fems9ke,t1_felwhpb,1579268154.0,We train in the evening and he gets a puzzle toy (everlasting bento ball) in his crate. He’s not interested in any toy or puzzle while he’s in the crate as he just is either whining or sleeping.
dogs,fems7nc,t1_fem1guz,1579268109.0,"Nah, he’s a small hound. He just has a lot of energy."
dogs,feltr4o,t1_feltifv,1579230724.0,"Yeah I’m bad about not letting him nap in the evening while I’m winding down. When he’s awake he gets into trouble and I end up having to follow him all around the house. We do go for a walk in the morning followed by fetch, a brief walk at noon and a walk/fetch around 6. He’s an energetic dog who could probably run a marathon before he got tired. So I’m finding it hard to tucker him out."
reactivedogs,fehm2jb,t1_fehlop5,1579119301.0,"No not yet. I was told by the shelter it wouldn’t be necessary for him. He also stops a lot. So I didn’t know if it would be good for dogs that need to continue going forward, as opposed to dogs who can’t stop going forward."
reactivedogs,fehjikx,t1_fehhvdt,1579117821.0,"I’ve looked into kikopup and similar videos. Which is where I learned “watch me”. Though the dogs on there are so much more calm than my wound up dog. 

Just a standard leash and harness. I tried a martingale collar but he kept almost choking himself out. Might try a gentle leader. He has a lot of problems stopping and refusing to move forward so idk if a gentle leader will help that as it’s for dogs who can’t stop going forward.

A 30lbs hound."
reactivedogs,fehgrb4,t1_fehgaoj,1579116207.0,No I haven’t been able to find a trainer or a training course in my area that has availability outside of my work hours. I plan on asking my vet for suggestions. So far the only training class that would work with my schedule is petsmart. And they don’t do leash manners.
TwoXChromosomes,f9v8a9o,t1_f9v7my3,1575664882.0,I’m not sure what an acidic smell smells like honestly. The smell sort of gives me a headache though. I don’t really notice that I’m sweating throughout the day really at all. It takes quite a bit of effort to get me to sweat actually. But it could be that I’m just not noticing when I am sweating.
