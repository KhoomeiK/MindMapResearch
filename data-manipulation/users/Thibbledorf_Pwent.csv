quityourbullshit,ff99roj,t1_ff99g15,1579708092.0,Dude this was 14 hours ago and I’m bored of people defending a rich teenager that doesn’t really actually do much other than scold people that could never afford her lifestyle for something with most of the contributing factors being outside of our control. Let me know when she actually accomplished anything remotely meaningful.
PublicFreakout,ff8fyvn,t1_ff7u59l,1579676785.0,When she busted out that laugh I was kind of sad thinking she was gonna turn nasty. Then she turned out to be as genuine as her laugh and I am content.
quityourbullshit,ff8f4xw,t1_ff8eokb,1579675805.0,This is honestly hilarious you seriously can’t help yourself can you? The way you did gymnastics to spin every comment into something slightly different was amusing for a while but I’m bored of it now. I won’t be responding again. Good luck saving the world! If you’re an example of a “real activist” you’re going to need it.
quityourbullshit,ff8dvns,t1_ff8dqby,1579674386.0,">Literally all of what you said is incorrect. #FakeNews.

Do I lack reading comprehension or do you put so little actual thought into your comments that you don’t even remember what you typed?

How embarrassing for you."
specializedtools,ff8di9w,t1_ff8d1dt,1579673972.0,Lol. You’re so bad at this dude. It’s ok. You tried your best.
quityourbullshit,ff8dahi,t1_ff8c62v,1579673734.0,"Your snopes article says she’s not the highest paid activist. When did I make that claim exactly? Do you think people that can afford to sail their kid around being an activist are the average working class family? 

So they did fly two people to retrieve the boat. Then they pulled some PR stuff to cover their asses when they got called out on it. 

You said I was lying yet you have done nothing but prove that I wasn’t lmao. 

Like I said, low effort deflection. Yawn."
specializedtools,ff8cv8x,t1_ff8c6yw,1579673286.0,"So let me get this straight. You think we should stop people from going inside an ER and getting what you consider to be help? The same people you were just whining that we should give drugs to even if they’re addicts? Do you even know what point you’re trying to make anymore?

Giving out opioids like candy is what caused a lot of addicts. Being more restrictive is what we should have been doing from the start. If that very simple and basic logic escapes you then I don’t know what to tell you. Either way I’m bored of you now so I’ll be moving on. I won’t be responding"
suspiciouslyspecific,ff8bpz9,t1_ff85pxz,1579672109.0,Just whatever you do don’t let the internet know you’ve played a visual novel by googling something when you get stuck. It’s like I flipped a switch and google was like “oooooh shit you’re one of them here we go!” The weird anime dating sim porn shit I got for ads for a while was seriously absurd.

Did they not fly people in to bring the boat back?

You’re right. You can google it. Obviously you didn’t because you’d rather just hide from things you don’t like and try to create a distraction.  

I don’t need to know more about you than your low effort attempt to discredit what I said without actually providing anything substantial."

specializedtools,ff89ncd,t1_ff895xt,1579670110.0,"Well, if you’re not virtue signaling then you’re out there on the streets trying to help addicts right? You’re actively contributing to solving the problem right? Of you’re not, then how exactly do you figure that you’re not virtue signaling when you’re unwilling to suffer even a little bit to help prevent drugs from getting out?

You’re just worried you won’t be able to get drugs if you get hurt and willing to cause more addicts if it means you won’t have to be uncomfortable. You’re in no position to talk to anyone about morals lmao."
specializedtools,ff88ydy,t1_ff88kko,1579669483.0,"Terrible person that spent 10 years supporting and trying to help an addict. The same addict that abandoned her kids with her mom, and then robbed her mom out of retirement. But yeah. Let’s all feel sorry for people like that so we can pat ourselves on the back for being such morally superior individuals. 

I’m sure you’ve actually done something other than make comments online to be such an authority on empathy. Surely you wouldn’t just be speaking out of ignorance and virtue signaling? Volunteer to help support addicts? You care so much right? So go help!

Besides. You’re not coming from a place of empathy. You’re just worried you won’t be able to get drugs because people want to prevent what happened to my sister from happening to other people. Pretty selfish. Giving them more drugs or opening more people up to addiction is the exact opposite of the empathy you claim to have."

They can be mildly uncomfortable sometimes but it shouldn’t ever be constant or really bad. If it is then it’s time to get measured and try some other options."

specializedtools,ff86ud7,t1_ff869j6,1579667652.0,I’m 1000% for doctors giving out fewer meds. I couldn’t be more behind that. I’m just tired of people acting like addicts are these helpless little victims of society that are too scared to get treatment. Then they virtue signal up and down about how we’re not helping them when there are already lots of existing programs. Most of them could actually get help if they wanted it. It’s really easy to bitch and moan about how nobody helps the addicts when you’re not the one dealing with them or having do anything at all.
specializedtools,ff85zmg,t1_ff855il,1579666942.0,"Close. She used to be my sister. Now she’s living on the streets doing who knows what after abandoning her children with my mom. She doesn’t have a fear of treatment. She doesn’t give a shit about anyone or anything other than her next fix. She has family that supported her and didn’t shame her for years. She’s burned all of those bridges now. She’s been to rehab so many times. Last time she got kicked out because she managed to sneak drugs in and messed up the recover of other people. 

It’s really annoying when people act like the stigma is all that keeps them from getting help. Sometimes they’re just selfish pieces of shit. It took me years to say something like that without feeling crushing guilt but is what it is."
specializedtools,ff83ara,t1_ff824sp,1579664853.0,Lol empathy. Fuck off. Live with an addict and then come at me with your empty empathy that costs you absolutely nothing.
specializedtools,ff815cc,t1_ff7vn6g,1579663272.0,I was honestly pretty worried when my surgeon didn’t wanna pony up some serious pain meds for after I got my gallbladder out. I realized on the second day of recovery that ibuprofen really actually was better for the pain. I’ll be damned. So I took the stronger stuff before bed and the ibuprofen during the day. I was way more comfortable. It’s like we’re programmed to want the strong stuff these days. Really opened my eyes to be honest.

quityourbullshit,ff7rwcj,t1_ff7rky4,1579656868.0,Lol. I make plenty of effort. You probably consider what you’re doing right now as effort but there’s all kinds of stuff everyone can do. Calling this girl a hero because her rich parents shuttled her around in a yacht is absurd. Let’s not forget the part where they made a big deal about it being low emissions travel but flew the boat crew from all over for their publicity stunt. They can’t even walk the walk and they’re out there scolding people that will probably never be able to afford a boat to sail around in. So they’re just rich hypocrites and you guys eat it up because doing that is easier than doing something.
quityourbullshit,ff7pmis,t1_ff7oadx,1579655279.0,Lol commit their resources. As if they’re making any kind of real sacrifice.

rarepuppers,ff6i72m,t1_ff6hjbv,1579627738.0,"Lol. Yep, there it is. Congratulations you did literally the thing I knew you were working up to. 

Pretty sure I can continue to safely judge anyone that’s walking around with a pug or an English bulldog or literally every other dog that isn’t usually bred as a service dog. Which is most of them. I’m not going to worry that someone might just happen to be one of the tiny amounts of people that has a service dog. 

I never said *all* dog breeding is bad. My point is that *most* of it is done for selfish reasons. 

You’re not being attacked. If you can’t handle disagreement without feeling attacked then just don’t reply."
rarepuppers,ff6h9vm,t1_ff6g9bi,1579627171.0,"Honestly? I don’t really care. 

If it turns out that you’re disabled or something then you’ve been having this conversation dishonestly in anticipation of your little “gotcha” moment when you reveal that you’re getting a service dog. At that point you’re ignorantly defending the entire dog breeding industry for a minuscule portion of dog breeders that are breeding working dogs. Which isn’t something that I have an issue with because working dogs by nature are bred and selected specifically to be *healthy*. Unlike other breeds that focus on a specific standard of looks. 

If you’re doing it because of allergies then you should be aware that no dog is truly hypoallergenic."
rarepuppers,ff6g23r,t1_ff6fkc7,1579626418.0,Alright whatever. You’re exactly the kind of person that breeders capitalize on. Do whatever you want. Lie to yourself if you want. I don’t really care.

rarepuppers,ff6cnwa,t1_ff6c158,1579624302.0,So you’re saying that no dog breeder ever surrenders defective or unwanted puppies to a shelter? Is that what you’re saying?
rarepuppers,ff6bwek,t1_ff6afg6,1579623818.0,So our choices are inbreeding them to oblivion or not having them at all? If people purposefully stopped breeding dogs there would still be plenty of accidental dogs filling up the shelters. In a perfect world breeders would move towards genetic testing to get the healthiest dog possible. Not to see which of the dog’s distant relative it can breed with to get the least possible genetic defects while maintaining a ridiculous standard that some dog show weirdos came up with. A standard that has nothing to do with the health of the dog by the way.
rarepuppers,ff6bgul,t1_ff67cls,1579623539.0,"If you think the majority of breeders actually do all of that, and the majority of people that support the breeding industry make sure to go to the small handful of people that are in it for all the right reasons, I’ve got a bridge to sell you. 

Your argument and that article doesn’t hold much water when you consider that the best thing for the health of a lot of breeds would to *stop inbreeding them.* Instead, they do all this scientific stuff to still be able to inbreed them with as few genetic defects as possible. 

If the worry is genetic defects it would almost always cost far less for someone to get a shelter puppy tested than to buy a purebred dog. 

>They have their dog’s hips, elbows, and eyes screens for genetic abnormalities and if they exist, that dog is no longer considered for breeding. That dog is then either placed in a forever home, or kept as a pet with the breeder.

The fact that so many purebred dogs are in our shelters proves, again, that this isn’t always the case. They also often just have defective or “problematic” puppies euthanized. Don’t even try to pretend otherwise. It doesn’t help anything to pretend that it doesn’t happen. Oh, and those forever homes are still them selling the puppies for profit. Just slightly less profit because the person buying it won’t be using it to churn out more ~~money~~ puppies. Oops I guess they forgot that part.

educationalgifs,ff55501,t1_ff4h9aq,1579580512.0,I had a back molar that ended up being too borked to save. I conveniently hadn’t needed to have my wisdom teeth out so they just yanked the bad one and moved in a new tooth for me lol.
mildlyinteresting,ff54v5j,t1_ff54atw,1579580295.0,When I was a kid I used to have this nightmare where someone stacked like 10 forks together and then made me bite down on them.

instantkarma,ff53qar,t1_ff4z5zq,1579579393.0,I think you guys are just seeing a lot of confirmation bias.
instantkarma,ff53l3k,t1_ff4wlzm,1579579281.0,Someone is driving dangerously close and might hit you... so you slam on the brakes? Seems like the opposite of helpful.
instantkarma,ff53dv9,t1_ff4x9kr,1579579128.0,Nah. Big fine and make their dumb asses take an anger management course to get their license back. Punishment is satisfying and all but I’d rather give them tools to be better than give them something to fester over.
mildlyinteresting,ff52khl,t1_ff4yfz4,1579578500.0,Safe as doing this other potentially really dangerous thing lol.
mildlyinteresting,ff52eyj,t1_ff50w93,1579578384.0,It’s hard for me to eat at restaurants because of all the silverware being rubbed together and the savages molesting forks with their teeth. I was hoping that I’d just get a tolerance of it eventually but I’m in my 30’s now and I don’t think it’s ever going to happen. It’s like a physical reaction of revulsion. I just got a shiver thinking about it and now my teeth feel weird. Sucks.
rarepuppers,ff4wut8,t1_ff4vv2a,1579574367.0,🙄
rarepuppers,ff4uc11,t1_ff4os1o,1579572637.0,Lol. Take away the profit and I guarantee you we’d have a hell of a lot less breeders. I always see this argument and it always sounds like bullshit.
rarepuppers,ff4tb2w,t1_ff4pk3r,1579571936.0,Getting downvoted by the backyard breeders and people that paid $$$ to get a pug that basically suffocates its whole life lol.
MovieDetails,ff4c3tn,t1_ff4865b,1579560119.0,This is actually a pretty good point. Some of my nails get longer than others because they don’t conflict with typing as much.
MovieDetails,ff4c05i,t1_ff47jph,1579560054.0,Off the nails?! I don’t like anything about this at all.
MovieDetails,ff4brfi,t1_ff45uuh,1579559901.0,Damn. Dude has long pinky nails and Reddit is over here digging through his family tree lol.
MovieDetails,ff4bhoc,t1_ff46ykp,1579559728.0,Ye find yeself in yon dungeon...
instant_regret,ff4a88m,t1_ff40kep,1579558931.0,"The most trouble I ever got into as a kid, and the most freaked out I've ever seen my mom, was when I opened up an old TV she had thrown away earlier in the day and was playing around with its insides. She looked outside, saw me sitting behind it poking at things with a screwdriver, and ran faster than I've ever seen her run. She really went off on me too. I thought she had seriously overreacted until I was older and realized I could have died lol."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff38u1b,t1_fezwbzt,1579536413.0,"Lots of people don’t get enough fiber which can cause all kinds of digestional discomforts that we tend to brush off as normal when it doesn’t have to be. For example a lot of people making jokes about what Taco Bell does to them probably wouldn’t have that problem if they were getting enough fiber in their diets. It mostly comes from fresh fruit and veg/whole grains and beans so it’s no wonder a lot of people are deficient. 

Drinking some fiber in the morning with a yogurt has been pretty life changing for me personally. I’m sure everyone’s mileage will vary depending on how much actual food they eat."

tifu,feznf3q,t1_fezex1n,1579459317.0,Oh no. What if she thought you were an adult woman? :(
WhitePeopleTwitter,fezlscb,t1_fey2ph8,1579458755.0,"To be fair, I wish younger me had known about fiber pills."
oddlysatisfying,fezllrf,t1_feyd778,1579458663.0,I think the reason is probably that it might get damaged.
