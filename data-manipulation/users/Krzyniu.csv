memes,ffdh4br,t1_ffdghb0,1579820741.0,At this point I think we underestimate the power of education. If in the XXI century there are people who don't believe in global warming or are against ecological stuff then the society is fucked up. People should know how to ecology and use that knowledge between others during elections. My country for example is still based on coal and most of the people are against atom power BECAUSE IT'S ALL GONNA BLOW UP LIKE CHERNOBYL AAAAAAAAAA. And we should know that trees are honestly not that important but there are many more important things such as morons who still use coal or old sandals in the fireplace
