i lived and worked in China for 6+ years, dated a local girl for some years and you should have seen the disapproving looks whilst on trains from some older locals. one even confronted her and called her a treasonous whore, then attempted to seperate our held hands. was amusing, and most of the carriage basically shut him down.

damn, get a tray, some baking paper, sprinkle some water over each piece and heat in oven at 340F/170C (fan-forced) for 8-10 mins. i dont know a single person who doesn't know this. not meaning to sound arrogant, just really surprised.

a fry pan, with drops of water also works on the stove top, cheese side down. its all about experimentation rather than being a bookworm and following another's instructions exactly. also, every oven is different so you need to play around and work out what works best for you, in all forms of cooking guys."

TheGoodPlace,ffew1y3,t3_ds0jhr,1579867935.0,"so totally agree with you. Jason is even more annoying than ever, a character i wish was never included, and the pseudo-philosophy is getting tiresome. i just finished EP 12, second last and it was the worst of the season, after getting to the real good place. seasons 1-3 were great, especially the first two, but this last season is only being watched because we're all fans and want to see it through. the writing is a mess and its just gone way too silly in a lame immature way, no jokes seem clever, its like a bad SNL sketch.

patience is key. if the devs don't think its ready for prime time that should be the end of discussion. remember the good old days when 0 day patch releases were considered lame but now is the norm and expected.

archlinux,feg4rt3,t3_eoxovx,1579076887.0,"its pure BS. i've been running Arch for 5+ years now and not once had anything remotely catastrophic occur. the same cannot be said for my OpenSUSE, Fedora, and Ubuntu virtuals which often, every 6 months or so, break and need some tender love and care to come back to life. i don't know where this BS came from but while Arch is known to be hard, its pure BS. install via the image base installer and its all working. pull  in what you want, whether its GNOME or KDE or whatever, for your GUI and you're done. not one issue here ever. if you cannot get Arch working stably, obviously with semi-decent-known-supported hardware, then its simply not for you but even saying that i still find it a HELL of a lot more stable and always working, considering its a rolling release, than any alternative. i am yet to be convinced otherwise.

give any Debian or CentOS derivative a go, wait 6 months without regular updates and see how well you go. i can bet you'll be in pain, ESPECIALLY if you're using a few non-standard repos to get the stuff you really need to get things done that the elder gods deem unsuitable. that stance by them has killed Linux and made it so insignificant these past few years IMHO. ppl want to work and get things done minus the circle jerks.

off on a tangent i know, anyways, Arch is by far my best experiecne with Linux by a factor of 100, once you have it installed, stable and config'd to your needs. BRAVO to all those involved!

those commenting on maual upgrade steps are inflating things. that happens twice or so a year, dependant on your packages of course. for a standard install including a DE like KDE, Gnome or whatever, you'll likely never need to even check the Arch Linux latest news pages. and even if you do, most decent pacman based GUI tools display this to you so you're aware. i think ppl are just lazy if they think their complaints are genuine.

EDIT: if you're using KDE i highly recommend Octopi for all your needs, which includes a great notifier tray icon tool plus supports AUR, latest news from Arch website and never had an issue with it. can't say the same for the GNOME based tools which don't do it for me. i'm kinda biased towards Qt these past 5+ years."
