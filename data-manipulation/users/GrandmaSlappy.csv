You may need a bigger pot for this. Grow light optional, but it makes them grow crazy fast. Warning -24/7 light makes a dark pothos look varigated and may cause some tearing as it grows so fast.

My husband is the same way, if he drinks too much then tries to sleep, he sleep walks (blackout walks?). But only after sleeping! When he sleep walks he sleep drinks and makes things worse. I've seen him pee on the kitchen floor and try to get out the front door. He doesn't respond to people talking to him and just wonders around like a zombie. You have to direct him back to bed.

He doesn't drink at all anymore and thankfully this only ever happened around me or friends and he never got out of a locked door. It was terrifying. Imagine just being totally totally out of your mind and unable to function.
