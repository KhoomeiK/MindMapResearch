Showerthoughts,ffjfwmv,t1_ffivnbt,1579997399.0,How you view and treat others says much more about your character than it does about the people you are judging. I hope something changes in your life to give you some more perspective.
AskReddit,ffiplfb,t1_ffignp0,1579979554.0,"I'm going to assume you are asking this from a truthful place. Everything about being a person is gray rather than black and white. People are neither completely introverted or extroverted. We just land somewhere in the gray spectrum, and that's great. Life would be a terrible bore if we were all the same. A person who is more introverted is happy spending time alone and find it recharging, or they don't like jumping into every conversation or event that they are invited to, or they find parties overwhelming and would rather spend their time just hanging out with a few friends. None of these things are problems. They are just human traits.

Your question here raises an unfortunate stigma around introversion. Our culture demonized being introverted. The quiet people, minding their own business become freaks for not playing along with every social situation others expect from them. They are viewed as lonely losers who have no friends. I'm not going to go on because this is making me feel like shit.

It is neither good or bad. Same for being extroverted. They are both just different types of ways to be. As long as it isn't making you miserable, there's nothing to want to change.

And people change throughout their lives. We're none of us stuck in a role because of how we have acted in the past. If you feel like you'd be happier being a little more extroverted/introverted, you can do that.

oddlysatisfying,ffgnu8g,t1_ffghil7,1579910597.0,"I was not calling you a slaver or a fascist. I wasn't implying that your reply to me made you one, either. The reference was simply a reference to a type of thinking that we humans fall into when something that we enjoy, even something as silly as an elephant doing tricks, has a much darker surface lying below. The slavery reference was an extreme because it is often easier to explain a concept with extreme examples.

I know that the pro animal court has probably made an animal slavery argument. I haven't heard it yet. I'm not in that camp. I eat meat, though I do try to source it locally and humainly as I can. I don't hunt because I'm way too antsy to sit in a blind all day but I eat venison my family catches. Our deer population is outrageous and a danger to people driving and our local biosphere, so hunting makes sense. I grew up with a family dairy. We visited and I knew the cycle of cows making babies, bottle feeding them, and sending them to either a meat farm or to butcher for veal. That's a lot to say I'm not an animal rights extremists.

But I totally get that you could have read that into what I was saying.

You're right. Calling someone some extremely unwholesome thing isn't ever helpful in an argument. I still can't concede discussing the rationale of slavers or fascists, as it applies to the conversation is an inappropriate way to have a discussion. It isn't pleasant or comfortable, for sure, but that shouldn't preclude it from having a place in our current climate. We talk about race. We talk about communism. We talk about war, poverty, crime, *animal cruelty*. Fascism and slavery aren't included along with the Native American genocide that the US is built on. They're all really uncomfortable. We'd rather not face that the human race operates this way. Just because we might not be choosing to actively do them ourselves, it doesn't mean that other people are making those choices right now. In a different situation, you could be that person. Uncomfortable."

If you were bleeding out but the ER refused to see you because of how you got your wound, wouldn't you lie, too?"
AskReddit,ffg5cj0,t1_ffg03ra,1579898796.0,"Oops, posted on accident.

Patients in crisis have more than likely already been trying as hard as they possibly can to fix themselves but are at the stage where asking for emergency help is their only option. Being honest about their situation won't get them treatment, so they are left with resorting to threatening suicide as a desperate way to get the medical care they need. 

These patients aren't malicious or trying to pull something over on their docs. The psych ward sucks. It isn't a vacation. 

Imagine if emergency medical care for major injuries were treated the same. Only immediately life threatening injuries being treated in ERs. Gunshot to the leg? Tough it out and go see your doctor. Add on the catch that the doctor will only see you for long enough to do one step of the process needed to fix the injury. 

Week 1 - learn about what's going on with the wound, how it happened, history that lead up to it, medical history, etc.. No actual assistance with the bleeding bullet wound.

Week 2 - repeat because you didn't have enough time to cover it last time. Infection is starting to set in.

Week 3 - inspect the wound. Infection is becoming worse because of neglect, your system is starting to get taxed from fighting the infection.

Week 4 - clean the wound. This now includes not only removing the original dirt and debris but, since this crisis wasn't properly dealt with at the time, cleaning to get a good look at the problem now includes painfully scraping away the infected materials. This step may take several weeks before the infection is under control. Let's say 6.

Week 7 - Begin removing the bullet. Phew. The issue is addressed. It was a rough procedure but it was good. But, times up. Leave the bullet in the hole for next week.

Weeks 8 thru 16 - oscillate between infection build up from open wound, cleaning away infected materials, and gradually moving the bullet closer to the surface. 

Week 17 - a break through! The bullet is out! Now the healing can begin. 

Over the next weeks the doctor helps stitch up the wound and teach you ways of caring for yourself that will help the wound heal properly. Now, all that's needed is follow up care.

That would be a ludicrous way to run our emergency medical system. But we accept it as the system for emergency psych issues.

So, when you hear patients saying that they're suicidal as a way to get into psych, they are really crying out for help that way because we've left them no other options. As a medical professional, you're aware of how broken our medical system is. Once you understand the reason behind these patients actions, this is no longer about them looking for empathy without making any effort. They need you to recognize that their crisis isn't a weakness or a failure to try hard enough but a totally human thing that happens.

AskReddit,ffg03ra,t1_ffei765,1579895568.0,"So much to unpack here. Let's start with the patient that wants to get into the psych ward. If you are in America, by and large, the only way to get care during a psychological emergency is in a psych ward. Psych wards are underfunded and overcrowded so the system in place is forced to only accept the most dire cases: people who are actively suicidal. There are many other psychological emergencies that merit intense care but unless you are actively suicidal, there's no means for help. Except if you are wealthy, of course."

Most potable water is sourced from wells deep underground but back in the day people had a habit of dumping anything unsavory down the well packing (sand that is between the pipe and the bore hole) because it absorbed quickly. That ended up contaminating the vast aquifers they pull from. It is highly likely that irradiated liquids would be introduced to the aquifers in the same manner.

When I bought them, I only bought carts that were made at a dispensary I trusted. I don't think I'd risk it otherwise.

Carts are not the only way to vape. They're just the easiest. 

I use concentrates, typically live resin, with a vape pen designed for that use. Concentrates are made by processing the plant or part of the plant, usually with high heat, to reduce down the oils, cannabinoids, and other stuffs into a dense product. There are a bunch of methods which create different products. I prefer live resin because it has the fullest profile of terpenes.  

We have to take a step back to understand why that matters. From a big picture view, the chemical parts of the cannabis that make it therapeutic or fun are cannabinoids and terpenes. These are both volatile, meaning they will break down easily and escape into the air. Heat is needed to activate these components to make them active. That's why people typically smoke pot. The cannabis used to create tinctures and edibles is always heated during production for these reasons.


A plant has a ton of varieties of each and their volatilities vary. When exposed to a small amount of heat, say to dry a plant, the most volatile compounds escape into the air and are lost. Heated drying is the usual starting place for all products.

That's where the live resin differs. After harvest, the plant is frozen and all of the processing to create the concentrate, which is inert, the opposite of volatile, is done under freezing temps as well. That way, the concentrate has the fullest range of terpenes and cannabinoids.

I am in no way telling you what *you* should believe. I do think that you should extend that courtesy, as well, if you want to have discussions on this topic."
POTS,fec220w,t1_febp6qd,1578965503.0,"Congrats. You have an easy to diagnose disorder and were diagnosed quickly. That situation doesn't apply to everyone. It takes years for many chronic illnesses to be diagnosed. The average MS patient takes up to 5 years and going to many other specialists before they get a diagnosis. 

Could you point me to some info specifically about people lying about POTS? I have read about facticious disorder (formerly called Manchausen disorder). In my opinion, fd is largely used as a trash bin diagnosis by many doctors who want to dump a difficult to diagnose patient. I don't think they are necessarily doing it maliciously. Doctors want to help and when they can't because they don't know what's wrong, it's easier to blame the patient than to believe them and not have an answer. A lot of chronic illness patients face this again and again and again before they get to a diagnosis. 

Your experience does not apply to everyone here. Many of us have a great deal of anxiety about our health from being doubted or told we're faking or the long trials to get to a diagnosis. Anxiety with chronic illness is completely normal. So is depression. Having mental health issues doesn't mean a person doesn't have physical issues.

What specialists have you seen? If you haven't seen one to evaluate you for POTS, then tell your doctor to shove it.

An anxiety disorder is a possibility. It's also an easy answer for doctors who are struggling to diagnose a patient. In my experience, doctors tend to put these kind of labels back on patients when they don't know what to do. It doesn't necessarily mean that is what you have. It often means that's the only diagnosis they can come up with that makes sense to them.

Trust your instincts. Find someone who will listen and take you seriously. Then, when there are hard truths to tell,  they will be much more likely to do it in a way that is compassionate and appropriate."

I do believe a loving God wishes us to stay away from bad choices because it's good for us and our people.

It took me a long time to get there but what influenced me was finding out truths about myself the same way you are. The more I was able to love  myself and to be kind to myself, the more I was able to let go of my 'sins' and see them as mistakes, not intentional wrongs.

medicalmarijuana,feae9sj,t1_feabs2q,1578947574.0,"I think we have a major disconnect over the supply, availability, and access to product. I don't think you believe that there is an issue with the amount of product any dispensary carries or with that supply being bought out and unavailable. I've experienced that frequently. I don't have any way of making you believe that, though. And, like I said earlier, I can't just go to the store the next day, nor can a lot of mm patients. Getting to the dispensary is a mammoth excursion for me. I only get there every 3 to 4 months.

You don't agree with my reasons. That's fine. But don't fool yourself into believing that I haven't given you reasons."
medicalmarijuana,feabs2q,t1_fea1sb2,1578946743.0,"I have explained, several times in several ways, why it's bad.

I understand that you aren't changing your opinions and you are going to do what you are going to do. I think it's shitty. 

Here's a metaphor that might help explain my standpoint. A pharmacy is full of medicine that helps people who are sick feel better. A lot of the drugs make anyone feel good, too. But access to the medicine is restricted by regulations to only go to the people who need it get it, even though more people want it. The pharmacy can only stock a limited supply of the drugs the sick people need because of the regulations. There's plenty of drugs in the world but the pharmacy can only have so many at any given time, especially the high quality meds. So it's important that only the sick people have access to the drugs that will help them or there won't be any left for them. If people started showing up with a bogus prescriptions, the whole system falls apart and the sick people, who the system was designed to help, get screwed. 

I don't know how to express this to you more. I get that you are in a shit situation with our current laws. I also think that using the medical marijuana system when you don't need medical marijuana is shitty, too. It impacts me directly. Having access to the medicine I need when I need it isn't selfish. You would not accuse a diabetic of the same over insulin or a cancer patient over chemo. You just don't want those products."
medicalmarijuana,fe9jgrr,t1_fe6rsge,1578938174.0,"I don't suggest you move. I actually made a suggestion for legally growing for others if you really do want to get a head start on a business. 

There are a million really good reasons for weed to be completely legalized. You've brought up a bunch. I agree with you. In fact, I reach out to my representatives and vote on this issue and I donate to groups working to create a better free market like the one in Colorado. It's just going to take more time. But there are legal ways to buy safe marijuana products right now. Safe product isn't being denied anymore.

Where we disagree is on the harm of people who don't need medical marijuana getting cards as a way to get the less expensive and more potent potent products. You also see a card as a business opportunity which I frankly find even more insulting.

But you will be one of many who game the system and tell themselves they deserve to or that they aren't hurting anyone. I've just gone through the trouble of pointing out that neither of those reasons are true. I'm sure it doesn't feel great. And I understand your defensiveness. I hope I've given you something to think about. Be safe."
medicalmarijuana,fe65j5e,t1_fe5pmd9,1578882262.0,"Btw, you don't need a card to grow legally in Michigan. People with cards have the ability to ask people to be caregiver growers. There's a huge demand."

medicalmarijuana,fe5gy1m,t1_fe5coc5,1578869310.0,"So, your response to my explanation of why it's irresponsible to get an unneeded medical card is:
* That you want to buy more weed at cheaper prices
* You want to use it for future business purposes
* You've 'waited long enough' so your entitled to it
* You prefer concentrates

I'll start with the last first. Concentrates are very popular as medical marijuana. Lot's of patients struggle with smoking due to health issues. I do and I have a hard time getting the concentrates I need. People buying recreationally with med cards encourages dispensaries to stock products that are less useful for medical patients.

As for the other three, they're straight bullshit. I'm sure I'm not going to change your mind but this is how it is. This is the reality for medical users. People gaming the system for shitty reasons like this piss me off."
Showerthoughts,fe3obsf,t1_fe2uchi,1578851270.0,"I totally agree that kids come out of school knowing how to be cogs in the system. That's 100% true. That isn't what I'm trying to get at. Maybe that was in the deleted comment?

I was responding to your comment, and I'm paraphrasing, that teaching kids about taxes in school was pointless. Perhaps we have been speaking past each other because we are coming from different starting points?

My opinion, in a nutshell, is that any finance education program should include an understanding of what taxes are, how they affect income, spending, investments, savings, and basically every aspect of money in a person's life. I think it should include the reasons for making the decisions on personal tax forms, too. If that includes busting out a paper from to explain what they're trying to teach, I don't see the harm. They obviously don't need practice filling out forms. We didn't need help doing that 20 years ago, either. It's the actual decisions that are the issue. Our job as adults is to teach kids what they need to know to become functional adults in our society and including taxes in financial education is part of that.

There is information available to learn how to understand how to make the best choices for yourself with your taxes. There are also options available to teach yourself calculus. It is a matter of deciding where our priorities lie.

I do also think it's insane that finance isn't a mandatory class but that doesn't preclude me from having a discussion about what should be taught in such a class."

medicalmarijuana,fe00eu5,t1_fdxcnux,1578800074.0,"Sure. Go to a doctor with a legitimate medical reason and get a card. If you don't have one, then buy your weed some other way. Licensed recreational is expensive right now and will be for a while. It's brand new. In a couple years the prices will come down as the market becomes more saturated. Reach out to your representatives to push for fewer restrictions on licensure and selling practices.

DON'T be an asshat and get an unneeded medical card to get a discount or better weed. As a medical marijuana patient who largely depends on mj to function, I depend on the quality supply. You might think there's no harm to buying stuff on the medical marijuana market. But I'm often in dispensaries looking for specific products to find they have sold out again before I could get there. I can't drive and can only go when my symptoms are good and I can get a ride so it's not like I can pop by whenever. There are legal limitations on how much product they can buy or have in stock at any given time.

What's worse though is that weed is literally the only thing I've found that helps me. I'm not going to get into my health situation but I've been completely failed by the standard medical establishment. Having found this one ray of light that makes it so I can leave my bed, it is totally insulting for someone to try to get into the system for personal gain.

They were completely uninterested in helping me and seemed like they didn't want to get involved in the messy situation at all. It took someone (I don't know who because I was lying face down in my own vomit which they refused to help me move out of) illicitly bringing me a phone and the threat of my lawyer and/or the cops getting involved to get me out of there.


That psych department was straight out of Bellevue, too. Before they'd put me in psych, they'd refused my simple request for saline, something that had helped before. They told me that I was pretending to have a seizure because I was drug seeking and we're in my face about how they weren't going to treat me. They told me they'd figured me out because I wasn't having epileptic seizures. I had no idea what was happening to me. I'd just started these seizures a few days before coming in to this ER. I was later diagnosed with PNES, seizures related to past psychological trauma. It falls under a whole slew of issues in the vagus response. Their reprehensible treatment kept me from getting treatment for years. Yes, I could have walked into a doctor's office and said, ""no way these bozos are doing this to me"" but mental health plays into our care way more than we acknowledge.
