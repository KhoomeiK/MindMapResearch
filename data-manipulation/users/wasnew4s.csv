WritingPrompts,fgudrqu,t3_f0d1dt,1581118343.0,"No one could understand what had happened   Usually complete orbital bombardment of a city would take several Earth years if not decades. Yet in under 6 hours of declaration an entire Garlax city had disappeared. 7 hours later another gone.8 hours. Another. It wasn’t until 23 cities had vanished that channels opened between the Garlax and Earth to negotiate surrender. It wasn’t even their president. It was the sixth in command. All others couldn’t be found. The entire planet was eventually scuttled and abandoned. 
It took the entire Federation 6 months of investigation before deciding to simply ask the earthlings what had happened. 
They stated that under one of their monuments, Roose Moose or something like that, was a cache of high yield explosives from generations past. They had retrofitted a handful of these onto some FTL drives, took aim, and fired. They didn’t know what they were. We still don’t know what they are. Needless to say, Earth and its colonies are enjoying some generous trade deals now. And now one has been on the Garlax home world since."

HazbinHotel,fgli383,t1_fgl8llo,1580898889.0,I would love a scene where one or more of the cast (preferably all of them) is super high and we get to see them as realistically as possible.
