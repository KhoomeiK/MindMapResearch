bipolar,ffgh369,t1_ffggy0h,1579906083.0,Benadryl /: I actually need to go see my doctor about sleep medicine though because last week I didn’t sleep for two days and had to leave work early because I was so useless lol
bipolar,fejxuns,t1_fegyr60,1579188325.0,God it’s like I jinxed myself... I didn’t sleep last night either... two days no sleep fml
bipolar,fegxp8o,t1_fegxc53,1579104853.0,"No no you don’t sound like an ignorant asshat at all LOL! 
I’ve tried it before, many times actually. Hell, i tried last night! I can’t keep still for anything and I’ve tried it sitting up, laying down, during a bath... my mind just races on and on. 
I should’ve mentioned in my post that I do smoke before I go to bed as it helps me sleep and sleep well/throughout the night. But that doesn’t always work obviously lol."
bipolar,fegxcdx,t1_fegm7ms,1579104631.0,I agree. I need to say something. It’s almost like clockwork that these sleepless nights occur. I can guarantee at least one night out of a month I will not sleep. Maybe two but never back to back.
bipolar,fegx6su,t1_fegndiu,1579104535.0,"Oh for sure will need to try to do 20 minutes then try to sleep. Also, I probably will try reading a book I’ve read already. My friend recommended the Sleep With Me podcast."
bipolar,fegx1b9,t1_feguvre,1579104437.0,Agh I wish I could do that. I just end up getting pissed off and my thoughts start racing -_-
BipolarMemes,feemzh9,t1_feemsee,1579037036.0,I actually face palmed when it hit me the following day
bipolar,feajcqr,t3_enyftw,1578949572.0,Thank you for posting this. I’ve had such a difficult time applying for graduate school. This gave me a push.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,feagsky,t3_eo57sr,1578948588.0,"Check out r/abortion. Literally the most supportive, helpful and informative community. I had an abortion in 2018 and still frequent that sub. Not to say this sub isn’t helpful— r/abortion may just have further insight! 
If you ever need to talk or get advice, PM me :) I’ve been there and I know that it can be a very confusing and difficult time."
BipolarMemes,fdgy803,t1_fdgh2jy,1578411242.0,I ask my brain that every day
bipolar,fclznmw,t1_fclymeq,1577760429.0,I do. That’s why it gets hard for me to sleep. It’s quiet but my brain is LOUD.
cats,fbgd4jc,t3_ed4z2o,1576845508.0,"I’m so glad you have that sweetie in your life. I have ptsd and bipolar, too. So I feel this (not entirely though because we are all individuals with individual experiences). My older cat literally hugged me the other day and I started crying the happiest of tears. 

Despite their reputation, cats can actually be such caring and loving beings <3 Also, my youngest seem to look just like yours!"
