fatlogic,fgsqw5y,t1_fgspupk,1581090734.0,"Replying to the second part of this, it really seems like you don’t understand diagnosed mental illness compared to someone just having low self esteem or a bad day. People with diagnosed (or undiagnosed) eating & body issues can’t just stop ‘beating themselves up’ when someone points it out. And telling them “what does that make me” will probably just make it worse. 

A suggestion I saw was “instead of trying to guilt trip someone who says they’re fat, maybe rephrase with positive words and say ‘I’m sorry you feel that way about yourself right now’” or something else supportive but also not really agreeing or disagreeing. If anything you can just not respond which is probably the best option."
fatlogic,fgsq7xr,t1_fgspupk,1581090313.0,"If someone with BDD says they’re fat it has literally nothing to do with their perception of other people. Comparing bodies side by side would probably not change that. You can’t fix someone else’s disordered way of thinking (wether it be BDD, an eating disorder, etc.) by pointing it out. I assure you they already know and it has nothing to do with anyone else’s feelings"
AnorexiaNervosa,ffxgt5m,t3_evoc0h,1580324854.0,If you fast you should look up refeeding after one. Usually you should eat thin broths with vegetables with light foods for the first day or two. That’ll probably avoid stomach aches
trashy,ffw23z9,t1_fft4g3a,1580281060.0,If it was in a place where free roaming was culturally accepted then why would they need a tag telling people not to call? No.
trashy,ffspnr6,t1_ffsmaj5,1580188145.0,Dogs shouldn’t be allowed to just free roam. They deserved to be annoyed by people calling and telling them their dog isn’t where it’s supposed to be if they let it do that. So yeah. Trashy

I’ve seen one or two but I’d like to stay away from citrus or fruit as a whole really (exception for berries) and they always seem to be citrus-y"

AmItheAsshole,ff0yv3m,t3_er1iyq,1579473635.0,YTA. It’s really childish to act so weirded out about....boobs. If you couldn’t pay attention that’s on you. Not a woman doing absolutely nothing wrong
AmItheAsshole,ff0ezqd,t1_ff0bv07,1579468256.0,I’ve told them so many times I don’t want to be friends again. They don’t really believe me for whatever reason. I do want to consider telling her directly but I’m not sure what the outcome of that would be. I’ve started to feel pretty bad for just not answering though
fatlogic,fehm76b,t3_ep26oc,1579119375.0,I thought they were reclaiming fat as a compliment? Apparently not. I can’t keep up
iamverybadass,feh1kpf,t1_feh1bs5,1579107228.0,Ok but what I’m saying is that his college can’t do anything. If he didn’t bring the gun to campus or tell someone he was going to shoot up the campus they are not allowed to intervene or question him. Reporting him for a picture is ridiculous
iamverybadass,feh1fh9,t3_eoukj2,1579107137.0,"I don’t understand all the people saying report him. He hasn’t done anything illegal as far as OP has said and trying to make (a false) report to the police, work, or school is just gonna take away all their future credibility. If he has done something illegal or something like make a hit list, tell people things that are concerning to others safety, etc. then I agree reporting him would be necessary but it just looks/sounds like he’s kinda weird and likes airsoft guns"
iamverybadass,feh0n0z,t1_feggrzl,1579106659.0,"He looks like he’s in high school but a college can’t do anything about this? College/campus safety can only investigate things that happen on campus with evidence of it being a crime. Same with any job, unless he’s bringing a gun to work and threatening people, reporting this is gonna look petty and also they can’t do anything about it"
