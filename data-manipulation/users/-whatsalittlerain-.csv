Just be honest and let her know that you are interested in her, you'd like to get the family involved and that when the time is good and she has had a chance to talk to her parents, if she still wants she can message you and you can start back from where you left off. Honestly trying too hard to not appear desperate (to the point that you're hiding your true intentions/feelings) can backfire and its not necessary. Be honest and do what you feel is right. She doesnt seem like she's lying or making excuses, as long as she isn't constantly prioritizing others over you (which you wont know until later) then its good."

Dont worry about society and other people and whether you'll be able to find someone/get married again or not, etc. There's plenty of time to worry about that later (although I think you'll realize at that time its not nearly as impossible as you're thinking). Focus on relearning what ""healthy"" is and where your boundaries are and what you want, and what areas of yourself need improving/mending. Also, you're 25 now, assuming the divorce is done at 26 (max 27) that's STILL within ideal marriage age. And ultimately, being alone is honestly not nearly as bad as what you went through already. At least your life is yours."
unpopularopinion,fdzymmf,t1_fdzx3tk,1578798978.0,"I don't think we're completely free from our instincts/nature, I mean far from it. Like, a child that grew up in an unhealthy environment will grow up to have those unhealthy habits and will have to fight those instincts but they still have free will in the sense that they can tell (or they can learn to recognize) that those habits are unhealthy and change them. Animals cant really do that. So while animals operate primarily on instinct, we have a bit more free will and can act against instinct. 

I'll definitely look into the concept of lack of free will more, sounds interesting. I dont know if I'll believe in the concept though lol imagine what that would mean for criminals, if someone commits a crime we'd just have to say they didnt have a choice, and we'd have to treat people who commit a crime out of insanity the same as sane criminals."
unpopularopinion,fdzvpfi,t1_fdzukyy,1578796920.0,"I'm saying humans do have the ability to differentiate between right vs. wrong actions, and that we have freewill (while animals/babies/inanimate objects dont). Yes, that's a better assessment. Part of that belief comes from religion itself, part of it comes from just personal observation. I'm not arguing whether this is a right or wrong view (whether its logical or illogical), just that this is the belief someone holds which would lead them to believe belief is innate."
unpopularopinion,fdzt00v,t1_fdzq912,1578795094.0,"I think you missed the whole point of my original post. Ultimately it doesn't matter how we define what is natural or unnatural, the point is freewill vs. freedom of choice. An animal of lower intelligence (or an inanimate object) will always follow its base instinct (or laws of nature), it can't choose to go outside of its nature (however you want to define its nature). If its following nature (or if it doesnt have freewill) then its following God's law. An animal that feeds its infant and an animal that abandons its infant are both following nature, because they literally cannot tell right from wrong. They're just doing what comes naturally to them. We as humans cant really argue and say ""its not natural for the animal to abandon its infant"" (even if its less common for this type of animal to do that) because the animal is simply doing what it's mind/body is telling it to do. They cant think outside their mind/body.

Also, I think you completely went off into a different topic, when I was simply explaining a viewpoint in my original post. I'm not arguing whether God exists or not, I'm explaining what someone who already believes in God means when they say belief is innate (you dont have to agree with the logic, just that they dont literally mean what you think it means)."

Also, I never said bees believe in God. That's really twisting what I said into something completely different. I said bees live according to God's law (nature) therefore from a believer's point of view even bees are ""believers"" (or followers). Bees dont consciously imagine a Being somewhere outside our universe making laws and constructing the universe, because they werent created with that kind of mental capability. They were created to follow laws of nature and that's what they do. They're ""believers"" through their actions, not their intentions/words (like humans). I think you might be taking things too literally."
unpopularopinion,fdyw8ey,t1_fdyl4eb,1578784218.0,"When SOME\* people say ""belief is innate"" they dont mean people are Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, etc and that they know the name of God from birth, know all the religious rituals, etc. They mean that all living creatures and all material things are a part of nature and follow nature's laws (which were set by God). All animals, babies, even the earth, mountains, flowers, bees, water, etc are all God's followers because they follow the laws of nature which are set by God. Like, bees dont decide ""well, we're not going to build our nest like this anymore, we'll just live in the ocean"". They just live as they nature tells them to. They go through minor changes to adjust to their immediate environment but its not a drastic change based on personal decision or longterm consequence or logic. Its just instinct. Which is what makes them ""believers"".

But when a person reaches a level of consciousness where they can tell right from wrong, then they can choose to deviate from nature (thus becoming a disbeliever). But we all disagree on what is ""natural"" and God's law, which is where all the different religions come in. Atheism isn't outside of that debate, it's just like any other religion (except they believe there is no God, there's just law)."

The wife cant just stay on her floor, clean/cook for herself, go to work, meet up with her friends when its convenient for her, etc. She still has to go greet her inlaws every morning/night/evening, wakeup before her inlaws to make them breakfast, cook for them, make sure the place is clean, make sure they know shes going out and when she'll be back, etc. I actually think that if our parents had better boundaries then living with them would be much, much easier and less of an issue."

If this was the main intention then we should all just stay with our parents instead of moving out and starting our own families. Instead what happens is the man stays with his parents, because his parents deserve to be taken care of, and the wife has to move in with him and help him with his obligations.

Here's a super [short video](https://youtu.be/wIIy9weoL4g?t=17) on loneliness. Everyone experiences loneliness but if you're around people, with friends/fam and still feel that deep inner loneliness, as if to the core of your soul, then its usually not a sign of romantic loneliness but a sign of disconnect from Allah. If you put more effort into your relationship with Allah (through acts of worship, dhikr, reading Quran, watching/listening to islamic videos, reading books) it'll take away that deep inner loneliness and then being around family/friends will help fulfill the social loneliness. The romantic loneliness will still be there but it'll be a healthy natural amount (which I think we all need otherwise no one would want to get married), but it wont take over your whole being. Talking to the psychologist should also help a lot and if you keep yourself busy it should help take your mind off the romantic loneliness. You can do it sis!!!"

I'll never understand how it's appropriate to get that drunk or go clubbing for a work related event. Who wants to even do that with their coworkers lol.

MuslimMarriage,fdeky7x,t3_ekrufc,1578341226.0,"My western nonmuslim friends didnt get to stay out late at night when we were younger (high school), and the ones that still live at home now still dont get to stay out late super late without getting an earful from their parents. The ones that moved out also dont stay out late cuz they have work the next day or its just unhealthy. Staying out late is only a thing for western college kids who dont study or neglected/out-of-control teens imo. Out of the ONE friend that we had growing up who had that level of freedom is now struggling with a drinking problem (was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning), cant hold a job for too long and recently had to move back in with her grandparents.

And western nonmuslims dont have a restriction/rule against having opposite gender friends the way we do but after a certain age opposite gender friendship becomes so complicated and messy that a lot of people avoid it and it becomes less common. Its normal/good for us to question and re-evaluate what is ""normal"" but you also have to look at everything objectively and without generalizing, western nonmuslims think muslims are oppressed and muslims think western nonmuslims are way too carelessly free, both of those things are huge generalizations. You cant judge normal when you cant see truth from falsehood.

There are some things that I realized were very different, like nonmuslim western kids are taught that independence is good but for us our parents always teach us to be unquestioningly obedient (therefore dependent). But if you study Islam more the western method in this case is more in-line with Islamic teachings.

If I can afford it I'd help out with the rent/groceries as well. This is all before kids. After kids I wouldnt be able to work so he'd have to take almost all of those expenses on himself. 

I know with some couples the husband basically gives the wife a ""minimum wage"" amount (in my city minimum wage is $14, full time is 30 hours. So the husband would give around $1600/month to the wife for her own expenses excluding food and rent). No idea how realistic that is but it seems to work for some. Many couples dont even have this type of divided system, they just spend from the same place.

No one else can help you if you dont want to help yourself. No one else can make you value yourself.

And that is not how married women feel after getting attention from their husbands. Their husbands take care of them, respect them, provide for them, protect them. When such a man gives you attention, its not anywhere near comparable to the type of attention these men are giving you. These men couldnt care less what happens to you or how you feel, whether you feel confident or not, as long as their own personal needs are met they'll say nice things to you. You complain that guys are so picky about outer appearance, guys dont value you, etc, then you turn around and find WORSE guys who dont value you even more (and these types of men are usually into a lot of weird ""ugly"" things, they'd think a 600-pound woman was attractive).
