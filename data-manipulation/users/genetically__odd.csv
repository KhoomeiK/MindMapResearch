ftm,fem4l6i,t1_fem3h06,1579239561.0,"Wow, we really are similar! I was dx’ed with EDS when I was 13, and I was 15 when I told that I’d need bilateral shoulder replacements before I went off to college. My dislocations are severe—my hips and shoulders being the worst—and bracing hasn’t helped. It’s part of the reason why I spend some time in a power chair these days. 

Anyway, you make several good points. You’re totally right that in the grand scheme of things, this isn’t a major change, and at least it’s reversible.

I used to get bullied a bit in school (and at home) for my forehead, but at least people found different material to work with as I got older. ~Namely, my disability.~ I lost quite a bit of hair when I was at my worst with gastroparesis and anorexia, and it made my forehead look a bit bigger because my hair got thinner around my hairline and temples. My hair is sort of dark and my scalp is very, very white, so that didn’t help. My hair’s recovered now, and my forehead is still taller than average. I think it’s proportional to the rest of my head though—I have a longish, angular face. Come to think of it, a short forehead would look odd on me! 

I’ll definitely keep the styling products in mind. I’m actually excited to be able to explore a new... I don’t know, part of style (?) that I’ve never been able to experiment with before. At least my hair holds curls (from an iron) pretty well, and it can get rather.... well, voluminous isn’t the word I’d use, but my hair is frizzy and dry, so it can get tall without any product. We’ll just have to see what happens it I get it cut!

Anyway, thank you for the kind words. It’s always helpful to hear from someone with similar experiences. Best wishes."

As odd as it sounds, I often forget that I’m just barely an adult. Between my health and several other situations in my life, I didn’t have much of a childhood or adolescence. I forget how young I was at the time of each of my diagnoses; it’s a blessing and a curse, I suppose. I was the first in my family to be diagnosed (my mother is the only other person with a diagnosis). I first learned of EDS when I was 11, and I quickly recognized that it was likely the missing puzzle piece. I researched for nearly two years. Two weeks after I was finally dx’ed with POTS, I brought a paper to my PCP that explained the link between EDS and POTS; he immediately referred me to a pediatric geneticist. Four weeks later, I had my official diagnosis. The other diagnoses fell into place in the following months. I didn’t have family support and have marginal amounts of support now, but that’s just how the cookie crumbles. I recognize that I am incredibly fortunate to have received my diagnoses at an early age. My diagnostic process went much quicker and smoother than most, but it certainly wasn’t a cakewalk. 

My “instincts” came about because I have had to be my own advocate for the entirety of my health journey. I fought my mother (and later, my father) every step of the way. Sure, there were times where they were somewhat supportive, but I learned to not count on them.

Generally speaking, I avoid pools. We have an indoor one at my college, but it’s about a 15 minute walk from my dorm (I cannot drive yet). For some reason, swimming seems to worsen my tachycardia and my dislocations, especially when I’m out swimming in the heat. It’s a shame because I used to love the water, and now I can only manage to get into the pool maybe three or four times during the summer. The summers are brutal here. 

I live in Arkansas, but I’ve actually had some pretty good luck in regards to finding medical practitioners who are knowledgeable about EDS. Sometimes I really and truly get a “dud,” but most of them have at least heard of it, which is usually better than nothing. Two of my PTs knew what EDS was and worked with EDSers in the past, but they just couldn’t seem to find a way to work with my particular combination of cerebellar issues, POTS, and joint problems. 

I would love to get into weight training, but I need to get my shoulders sorted out first... and probably my POTS. I do some yoga on and off mainly for relaxation purposes. I don’t find it to be particularly helpful in terms of reducing pain or stiffness. I do have unusually short and tight hamstrings, but the rest of my body is very loose (and yet somehow manages to feel stiff). It doesn’t matter what type of stretches I do, there’s just this feeling of stiffness that will not go away. The best way I can describe it is like a knuckle that you know you need to crack, but it won’t budge no matter what. It’s aggravating. 

I’ll definitely look into compression stockings and yoga pants. I’m gonna see what my doctor says about compression stockings first (and see if he wants to prescribe me some), but I’m also in the peeing-every-hour camp. Also, tight clothing (like shoes and pants) can be daunting because I have been known to pull my ankle apart just by taking off my shoes. Same goes for tighter pants, especially jeans—I can sometimes feel what seems to be my tibia separating from my femur. Maybe it’s just my imagination, but it’s uncomfortable.

I’m glad to hear that you’ve found a rhythm in the midst of the craziness that living with EDS typically is. EDS also tore my life apart—I am no-contact with my mother (medical neglect, among many other things) and have been living with my father for the last two and a half years, but his understanding of my health isn’t... the best. Long story. Things are tough, but they’re better. 

I’ve tried a lot of things in an attempt to improve my quality of life. The one thing that has made the biggest difference is gaining access to crutches and a motorized wheelchair, but neither came without a huge uphill battle with my family. Again, long story. I think reverting back to my simpler medication regime will also be helpful—it’d save me $30 a month, which means a lot. As much as I’d like not to be dependent on any medication whatsoever, I am utterly bedridden without beta blockers and pyridostigmine. Sure, I feel horrible about 75% of the time, but at least I can be vaguely functional while I’m taking them. It’s not an ideal management plan, but it’s all I have."

POTS,fehq4ez,t1_fehp20g,1579121638.0,"Nope... but I understand that it can sometimes cause a spinal CSF leak? 

My last known measurement is 17 degrees... and that was when I was 11 and 5’3”. I’m 5’8” now, so I’d reckon that my curvature has likely increased. My original PCP definitely thought so as well, which is why I went for the 3rd MRI. 

That said, I know it hasn’t increased to the point where surgery is typically indicated—perhaps to the point of bracing, but that may be pointless at my age. My curvature is in my thoracolumbar region (not to mention curvature in my neck, which is a bit unfortunate).

I’m supposed to see a rheumatologist in April, but that’s not an insubstantial amount of money... if I go, I’ll almost certainly have an x-ray done on my spine anyway, so I’ll find out about my curvature then. 

I’m done growing (sadly), so the scoliosis shouldn’t theoretically get worse, but I’ve heard of it continuing to progress well into adulthood. Chiari and EDS both seem to be risk factors for that, so I suppose it’s something to keep an eye on."
POTS,fehoiur,t1_fehmicj,1579120714.0,"Thank you for the sources! I’ll have to check them out.

My nasal discharge gets exponentially worse whenever I lean forward, making it bothersome to read or work on coursework at times. I do have symptoms consistent with decreased intracranial pressure, but those symptoms are pretty vague anyway, so I take that with a grain of salt. It’s annoying and painful at times, but I’m still alive. 

My last MRI (cranial + spinal) was in July ‘17, and the hospital never gave me the images. I didn’t even get a report until April ‘18, and it was unhelpful. It merely said that I had a Chiari Malformation and scoliosis, both of which had been confirmed years prior. I’d been sent for that MRI in order to see if there were any changes in my herniation/curvature, but the hospital refused to give me numbers. They told me I’d have to return for an x-ray (several month wait, by the way) in order to have my curvature measured. I am so, so glad that I’m 18 for the sole fact that I will never be referred to that pediatric hospital ever again. That’s just one of a multitude of aggravating experiences with that place. 

All that mess aside, the last usable MRI I have is from July ‘15. If I ever receive another MRI, I’ll make sure to send it to Cedar-Sinai if I feel the need to do so.

POTS,fehl1nh,t1_fehjc5e,1579118706.0,"I’ll have to try and find the name of the protocol; it could be helpful. Cardio has proven to be a no-go for me. I had some pretty bad reactions to it in PT, even after months and months of working... a metabolic stress test showed me that my BP does some *funky* things whenever I do cardio. My BP was 150/50 and my heart rate was around 180, and that was when I was on my beta blockers. Granted, my meds have changed since then and plenty of time has passed, but I’ve still noticed my BP going topsy-turvy when I exert myself. It’s not as bad now, but it’s enough to put me down for a while. 

As for the price of PT, I’m not sure what’s normal anymore. $30-$60/session for 45 minutes is a *steal,* not to mention for 50 sessions a year. I’ve only ever been on this insurance, but most plans are not generous. I wouldn’t be surprised to find that some insurance plans don’t cover PT at all. 

My dislocations are unfortunately a huge barrier when it comes to exercise. Four years ago, we found that even the lowest amount of resistance could dislocate my shoulders and hips. Although my dislocations generally aren’t painful anymore, I know they’re still damaging my joints. Frequently, I wake up with dislocated shoulders and numb arms. My right shoulder is especially bad about falling out of socket, so I constantly have to keep the muscles in that shoulder tensed. The second I relax, my shoulder dislocates. Getting up from a chair can dislocate both of my hips if I’m not extremely careful, and... you get the idea. I’ve been told that I would need bilateral shoulder replacements before I hit 20, and bilateral hip replacements not much longer after that. I’m not 20 yet, but those surgeries just aren’t happening. Anyway, I won’t bore you anymore with that. 

Bracing hasn’t been helpful at all. Even a bilateral hard orthotic for my hips didn’t do anything to prevent dislocations, so I’m in a motorized wheelchair when I’m too weak to use my crutches. I might as well invest in a suit of armor. Even if I’m still dislocating joints, I’ll look pretty rad. 

On the other hand, it takes a lot of patience to wade into *that* sub. Online support groups are generally not my thing. I’m pretty surprised that I’m even in this sub at the moment. One day I’ll visit the EDS sub for more than 30 seconds, but I don’t think today is that day. :P"
BadMUAs,fehjd4a,t1_fehd7cp,1579117732.0,"As a fellow pale olive, here’s my solution: L.A. Girl foundation mixers. I have the white, blue, and yellow ones. If a foundation is too yellow and dark, I add a bit of white and a TOUCH of blue—that stuff is no joke. If it’s too pink/peachy, I add enough blue and yellow to balance out the pink and make the foundation neutral, and then add a HINT more to make it lean olive. 

It takes practice and some trial and error, but it’s so much cheaper to buy those mixers ($8.99 a piece) instead of trying to find a perfect match; I’ve yet to find one, but now I can make just about any foundation work for me so long as I have those mixers. It isn’t an ideal solution, but it works."
POTS,fehicia,t1_fehg5rh,1579117139.0,"Thank you for your suggestion. I appreciate you taking the time to read my story and my responses!

I’ve been through 3 rounds of physical therapy. Each round ended in... disappointment, to say the least. Although each of the PTs were familiar with EDS, they didn’t know how to work with my joints. We found that you can’t really build up muscle mass in order to decrease dislocations if the exercises cause dislocations in the first place. I can imagine that it’s frustrating for them; I know it was for me. I’m grateful that they all tried to help, though.

Anyway, my insurance (unless things have changed) charges either $30 or $60 per session for up to 50 sessions per year. After that, it’s full price. While that setup is pretty generous... that money does add up very, very quickly. 

PT is something I’m planning for in the future, though. Last time I was in PT was four years ago, and they told me back then that there wasn’t much they could do for me and my joints. A whole lot has happened in 4 years... not sure how much they could do now. Who knows, though... maybe by the time I can finally afford PT, they’ll come up with something new. Gotta keep my chin up somehow, I guess?"

Funny that you mention that—I’ve somewhat suspected that I’ve had CSF rhinorrhea for... a while. I’ve had a constantly runny nose (clear, watery liquid) for the last five years, but I don’t have the guts to bring it up or the means to get imaging done, unfortunately. And I know the treatment for a CSF leak is typically surgery, and I don’t have the money for that. 

I’ve previously heard of spinal CSF leaks creating negative pressure and causing cerebellar herniation, but it’s been a couple of years since I’ve looked into it. I’m not sure if CSF rhinorrhea could cause the same thing.

My MRIs (3) all showed cerebellar and brainstem herniation, but no sign of a CSF leak. Only one was done with contrast, but I’m also aware that CSF leaks don’t always show up on an MRI. Nothing ever showed up that suggested any abnormalities with intracranial pressure, but I know that that isn’t always obvious on an MRI. It’s been over 2 and a half years since my last one; my PCP says I’m overdue for one, but that’s a lot of money for a college student to shell out. 

On a semi-related note, my headaches aren’t 100% postural. Sure, my Chiari headaches come on quite often when I’m upright, but I frequently find that lying down doesn’t provide much relief. Not quite sure what that means. However, bending my neck backward so that my skull rests on my back does seem to help sometimes, but I’m sure that it’s not doing my spine any good."

I will also look into the therabands! I do have a significant amount of ankle instability (even with bracing) and what seems to be arthritis, so any type of movement can be quite painful. I have a rheumatology appointment in April if the money works out, so I’ll have to see what I learn there."

I’ve read some studies regarding IVIg and they’re interesting, to say the least. Definitely something to look at in the future if my doctor wishes to pursue other treatments; he’s said that we’re basically at the end of the line as far as medications go. 

Therabands unfortunately not been kind to me. I used to use them in physical therapy a few years ago, but even the lowest resistance was enough to pull my shoulders clean out of socket. Same goes for my hips. That said, I try and go for short walks when the weather is agreeable. Too hot, and my POTS flares up. Too cold, and my joints flare up. I’ve found that walking is about the most I can do at the moment, but I figure that it’s better than nothing.

It often feels like I’m in a vicious cycle. My joints hurt/are unstable and obviously I have POTS, so exercising is really difficult. And because exercising is difficult, my joints and POTS get worse. I’ve been trying to find a way to break the cycle, but it’s proven to be really difficult."

Long story short: Ivabradine did absolutely nothing for me. Same goes with Midodrine.

World of Pain is fun if you’re patient and looking for a challenge. People seem to like the Alton, IL quest mod, but I never got more than a few minutes into it. I don’t remember any other quest mods for Fallout 3. I know they exist, but quest mods for NV are much more plentiful.

There are many animation mods to choose from; some alter combat animations and others alter day-to-day animations. These do a great job of making the game feel a tiny bit more modern. 

Fellout is a popular choice, but I can honestly live without it. I personally like the green filter in Fallout 3, but you may not. My one major gripe with the mod is that it makes the nights way too dark. I had to install a separate mod just to add night vision goggles!
