PublicFreakout,fglfukm,t1_fglcydl,1580895589.0,"Multiple Republican senators have stated that they believe Trump's actions met the standard for impeachment, they just believe it is not a requirement that they remove him from office because of that. 


To an extent, I have to agree with their rationale - possibly also that whatever benefits might come to the country (as a whole) are outweighed by the schism that would follow the first removal of a president during already tumultuous times.


But to act like Trump didn't do anything?

JusticeServed,fdqxxp9,t1_fdpw8jx,1578676445.0,"There is an idea that is reasonable and just here, the problem is that the scenario is even more nuanced than your very reasonable concern. 

An abortion is not an easy thing, physically or psychologically - there would need to be a financial sharing of the burden of the procedure, any and all follow up care, time away from work, etc. The problem with this is the problem that exists now, it is very easy for a man to slip away from his portion of the liability.

Another concern would be the enormous amount of unenforceable or difficult to litigate oral contracts created by men that convince their sexual partner that they would support them in the event of a pregnancy, or, that a pregnancy would not happen because they have supposedly had a vasectomy or are infertile, etc. In these cases, especially wherein the male has been informed that due to the religious beliefs of his female partner that abortion is not an option, he should effectively be waiving his right to a legal separation from parental accountability (a mouthful of a term, but let's not call it a legal paternal abortion..).

There are many other challenges that I can think of off the top of my head. None of this negates the fact that on a moral level I agree that there should be a way for a man who has been misled about what would happen in the event of an unwanted pregnancy or that there is no chance of a pregnancy should have a way to absolve themselves of the financial burden placed on them in these cases. The problem cuts the same way for men and women here - what some people say in the passion of the moment can be very misleading, whether intentionally so or not, and there will rarely be more than hearsay in terms of evidence unless precoital contracts become like condoms, available in bathrooms at bars, kept in nightstand drawers, etc.

For now, men should try a little harder not to kill women they feel have put them in these situations. It makes it hard to think of the sometimes legitimate mens rights side of this argument and adds quite a lot to the ""Wow it's fucking terrifying to be a woman in an emotionally and financially charged potential dispute"" thing."
