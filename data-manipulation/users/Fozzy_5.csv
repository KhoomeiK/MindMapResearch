Ok, so stop being obese. Got it."
fatlogic,fd9uhqk,t1_fd9ovex,1578238217.0,It's already begun. I've seen posts from people saying they've found doctors that don't weigh them or give them any advice whatsoever regarding their size or weight.

fatlogic,fd9mubf,t1_fd9ku8f,1578235470.0,"Or just ignore the problem, because high blood pressure is a social construct or something along those lines to make them feel better. Half expecting one of them to say ""Hypertension is fierce!"" or some other bullshit like that."
fatlogic,fd9k0og,t3_ekcr9j,1578234461.0,"So how exactly would that commentator suggest lowering blood pressure? I recently found out my blood pressure is very high after it being normal for most of my life. My last checkup a few weeks ago showed I was 156/93 (age 31, 6ft tall 205lbs) which shocked me. You wanna know what I did? Bought a blood pressure machine to check at home (which showed I was consistently in stage 2 hypertension territory, scaring the crap out of me) and began changing my eating habits and hitting the gym again since lately I've been eating poorly and not working out. My blood pressure this morning was 125/90, which is still high especially the bottom number, but I've seen vast improvments from the 170/105 numbers I was registering a few weeks ago. I guess my point is that FAs like that commentator are anti science morons and are the equivalent of anti-vaxxers. These people would rather you suffer from preventable diseases than have their feelings hurt."

fatlogic,fd5pez6,t3_ek3vy3,1578179972.0,That can't be real. That's science/reality denialism to the absolute extreme.
fatlogic,fd2d4n5,t1_fcxymoh,1578145491.0,"This is something I always found hilarious. So many of the FA types are communist/anti-capitalist, yet throw those ideals right out the window when it comes to their food and beverage consumption. Also, you see many go on about climate change activism, yet that kind of overconsumption is detrimental to the planet."
