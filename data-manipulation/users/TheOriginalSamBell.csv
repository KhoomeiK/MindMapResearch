Android,fgh61b1,t1_fgh2uug,1580777531.0,"I agree with the amp but do you really think this stupid quad dac setup is necessary for good sound? Do you also listen to ""Tidal Masters"" (MQA) which is a whole 'nother bag of marketing bs? The technology to perfectly listen to music for humans software and hardware wise has existed for decades now that's why they have to come up with ever new bs to keep people buying. I'll bet any amount that the dac (single dual or quad) will make approximately 0.7% of difference in proper double blind tests. The best dac is transparent they say. (disregarding a dac's digital filter settings and stuff like that but that doesn't mean that this quad setup has somehow ultra superior filters. It just may or may not sound *different*) I'd also put up my trusty old rockboxed Sansa Clip+ against any a hundred  times more expensive setups. If you have good source material (ie 16/44 flac, no MQA or 24/96 and all that crap) good headphones (and the amp to drive them) you're already 99.9% there of what's at all possible for humans to hear even with an el cheapo boring normal single dac. The rest are personal preference, filters, delusion and placebo. Thanks for reading lol"
