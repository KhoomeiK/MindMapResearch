falloutlore,fgkodek,t3_eyvq3x,1580870086.0,"I actually have an unconfirmed theory/headcanon for this. House gave the fiends the energy weapons for a few reasons. The first reason is that he wants to keep the NCR occupied so they can't maintain complete control over the Vegas area. West vegas is a VERY valuable area for a few reasons. It marks the western border of vegas, the one closest to NCR territory. This allows House to bottleneck all NCR forces and confine their transportation routes through Mojave outpost and the major highways toward vegas. Besides this, the pre war rail lines also travel through the area, meaning that if the NCR controlled fiend territory, they could move even more troops and resources into vegas. Theres also preexisting industrial structures that appear to be in relatively good condition. In fact, the Las Vegas Steel factory is still active and functional, and just so happens to be controlled by House, according to a terminal (yes I know this is part of a scrapped quest, but it still proves that house controls steel production in the area). House is actively paying the fiends in energy weapons to protect his steel factory. Besides all the economic and geographical reasons, the fiends being more powerful helps to put more pressure on the NCR. House says that he doesn't want caeser to die for this exact reason. The NCR needs to be strong enough to clean up the dangerous raiders and to develop an economy in the area, but it also needs to be weak enough so that when house declares independence, they can't stop him. The fiends are perfect for this, as they seem to have a particular hate for NCR soldiers and citizens (possibly encouraged by house). They are also based right across from McCarran, but far away from any entrance to free side or the Strip. House could easily send in securitrons and/or assisted NCR soldiers to clean out West Vegas and help to limit dangers to traders and visitors to the strip, but he doesn't. Personally, I think that the steel production is the primary reason and something he wants to keep hidden from the NCR, as its vital for building securitrons and reinforcing walls around vegas, but take whatever you want from this."
