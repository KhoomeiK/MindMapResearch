1. She always rushes into danger. The first two-three times were fine, but the times after that are kinda silly. Since she keeps getting caught in these predicaments, give her a weapon! A gaurd! Anything! I don't really care, just make her able to defend herself!

2. She is extremely childish. She is supposedly the best handler there is, and yet she can get distracted so easily, and act like a child in a Walmart toys section. It just sucks. Plus, she shouts out things we already know."
