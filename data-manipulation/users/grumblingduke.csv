I get why they felt those sequences were useful (explaining how Vader got from Cloud City to the Star Destroyer), but it's one of those things where you should be able to trust the audience to fill in the gaps.

My favourite fun fact about that sequence: [they only built the left side of the Star Destroyer bridge set](https://imgur.com/a/MTa7Q) (and then only the crew pit, some walkways, and a couple of arches - the rest is matte paintings). So when the officers and Vader are all clustered by the side window, the shots are reversed (most noticeable from the rank badges). I suspect so it balances the shots inside the Millennium Falcon cockpit."

They are attuned to the Force, and have some kind of vague collective conscious. When a Jedi (or similar) wants or needs a lightsaber, a kyber crystal may call out to them across space, choosing them Harry-Potter-want style.

As part of the lightsaber construction, the Jedi has to bond the crystal into the mechanism, and in doing so, bond themselves to the crystal. If the crystal is Ok with that, you get a nice colour in your lightsaber. If the crystal isn't happy, you have to force it to work for you, and that makes it ""bleed"", causing a red colour (a purple colour being somewhere in between).

It seems likely that you can get the crystals to work without being Force sensitive, but you need a lot of them and they might not work that well."
StarWars,fgimtpu,t3_eypczv,1580826044.0,"This is a fun, silly scene. It shouldn't be there.

It takes place in the middle of the Hoth evacuation. It is supposed to be a tense sequence - starting from ""General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four"" pretty much all the way to when Luke gets to his X-Wing (or when the Millennium Falcon takes off). This whole chunk of the film is a carefully-paced, action sequence, which builds up tension (with a couple of outlets), puts the main characters under quite a bit of pressure, has quite a bit of death (of good guys as well), and has a fairly sombre outcome (the good guys lose; sure, many of them escape and survive, but their base is destroyed and a lot of them die). It's not the kind of sequence you want to throw jokes into.

There is some humour in there (as there is throughout the OT), but it mainly comes from the characters being themselves; particularly Han Solo making one-liners and quips at people - but that's what he does, and fits with his character (the more serious he gets, the more he tries to deflect with insults etc. - Leia does the same). And for this part of the time, it all happens while furthering the plot in some way. The one exception is C-3PO being dragged through the door after it shuts in front of him - and personally I find that shot a little jarring and out of place.

This shot (the wampas and Snowtroopers) requires three bits in the film to make it work; something to establish the Rebels have captured Wampas or have a problem with Wampas getting into parts of the base (iirc this was in the script at some point, not sure if it was ever filmed). Second, we need the set-up of C-3PO removing the sign during the high-stakes race to the Falcon. Third, we need the pay-off when the Snowtroopers, chasing the Rebels, open the door. That's three decently-long shots or bits of script dedicated to a joke, which aren't furthering the plot.

Finally, this sequence involves C-3PO acting out of character. Why would he remove the sign? That would go against protocol, surely? Why does he stop when in danger of being left behind? We don't even care about the Snowtroopers being mauled by wampas; maybe if it slowed them down for a bit longer and that had a clearer pay-off later it might work, or if someone other than C-3PO had removed the sign (showing sneakiness and cunning - not traits 3PO is known for). But as it is, it doesn't quite fit.

So for that scene to be included, we have to break the drama, add in 2-3 extra shots with no plot reason, have to pull someone out of character, all for a single joke where the punch line is some random Snowtroopers getting attacked by a wampa arm.

I'm glad someone said no to that scene. I wish there was someone like that working on the Prequels and Sequels to say no to some of the random jokes."

AskReddit,fg7w5ph,t1_fg7ojmj,1580602999.0,"> If i'm making up and example, let's say that a country wants a law for all of Europe that decides how much milk fat constitutes the label ""whole milk"".

So... let's take this example. Firstly, someone at the Commission decides to start looking into this (whether on their own initiative, because someone from the Parliament has asked them to, because someone from the Council has asked them to or whatever).

The measure will start in the relevant Directorate-General (one of the EU's Government departments); in this case either Health and Food Safety (""SANTE"") or Agriculture and Rural Development (""AGRI""). Whichever takes the lead, the other will likely be involved as well.

That DG will set up a group of civil servants to start researching the matter. They'll consult across the EU, probably finding out what current labelling standards there are at the national level (or what approaches have been taken outside the EU), what options might be available, what it might cost, who might object, what the impact might be, and so on. These people will not be farmers, biologists or nutritionists, but they will be experts at researching things. And they will have built up lists of groups of those people (industry bodies, unions, lobby groups, umbrella organisations, national agencies) to consult directly, and they will also consult publicly (in a way that anyone can respond).

For example, there isn't much going on right now (new Commission a couple of months ago so they're still settling in), but the EU started consulting a couple of weeks ago on minimum wages. This is a particularly special kind of thing (as the EU Treaties require that they consult unions and industry groups in this area of policy) - so it isn't really aimed at individuals, but [you can read the consultation document here](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_20_51). It's 14 pages, sets out what the EU is thinking about, what its options are, what research it has done, and gives some questions for unions and businesses.

Once they get responses to the consultation, they'll basically go through the whole process again; reading through all the responses, carrying out further research, asking follow-up questions and so on. And the cycle keeps going until the Commission is satisfied it has all the information it needs, and can put together a legislative proposal that will be legal, proportionate, necessary, won't upset too many people, and will likely make it through the Parliament and Council.

And then, and only then, will draft legislation appear and head towards the Parliament and Council, probably following [the ordinary legislative procedure](https://epgencms.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/upload/54cc976a-b1ce-4edd-b941-f1e3d6edbfba/chart-1-OLP-EN.jpg).

> If the commission hires everyone with an opinion to do the study, the study is meaningless, but how is it decided who takes part in a study? Who decides the participants for research?

The civil servants involved. These are the ""faceless bureaucrats"" that libertarians love to hate on. They are people who work in offices and research things. They know how to find things out, how to put compile reports, how to consult effectively and so on. Now, sure, Governments with dishonest intentions can abuse this by messing with their research. And that's where part of the hate for them comes from - politicians can really hate these kinds of people as they sometimes give answers that aren't politically correct - drug policy being a big area in the UK - and when the evidence/research comes back with the ""wrong"" answer, rather than questioning their political beliefs, politicians tend to direct the anger at the researchers."
AskReddit,fg7mmtf,t1_fg78veq,1580596207.0,"Yep. But the same is true for any Government; again, it's a meme-level complaint - ""the EU is too complicated with all these things"" - but if you think about it, you realise it is probably less complicated than existing national or regional governments.

The EU Government feels complicated because people don't understand it. The UK Government doesn't because people think they understand it even if they don't (including Boris Johnson, who has shown a certain ignorance for British constitutional theory lately). And that's with it being far more familiar."
AskReddit,fg7meod,t1_fg7atrb,1580596050.0,"> Care to share your interest in EU policy? Citizen, academic, business?

So... citizen, kind of academic, and kind of business?"
AskReddit,fg7m3lr,t1_fg7esm3,1580595837.0,"Any time a Government body does something it should be getting experts in whatever it is to do it for them.

So if a Government was a computer programme written it should have a programmer. If it needs to run an advertising campaign (say advising on the changes due to the UK leaving the EU) they should have advertisers doing it. If they want to come up with healthcare advice, they'll want healthcare professionals.

And if they want to draft laws, they want legal drafters. These are civil servants, with a background in law, who are experts at writing laws. The elected representatives, ministers etc. get to decide what the law should do, but the drafters make sure the law actually does what it is supposed to (badly-written laws can cause all sorts of problems; in the 80s the UK passed a law creating an age-rating system for videos, that started as a Private Member's Bill - so drafted by lobbyists not the Government - a 2009 review found that it hadn't gone through the proper procedure so had been unlawful all along, which really messed with those people who had been convicted of crimes under it).

So let's say a Government wants to pass a law in a particular area. Usually they'll start by identifying the need, then consult privately and publicly (these are often called ""Green Papers"") to get the view of experts, public interest groups, lobby groups and so on. Then, based on that, they'll move on to a ""White Paper"", setting out the conclusions of the consultation and maybe putting forward draft legislation (again, for comment and criticism). That then leads to draft legislation, and maybe finally full legislation that goes before a legislative body.

So the elected representatives (the UK Parliament or European Parliament and Council) are among the last people to get involved in their official capacity (although obviously some will be involved throughout); actually voting on the law is the final step in a process that could easily take a decade or more, even for relatively simple legislation.

This is particularly important with the EU given the extra restrictions on what the EU can legislate. The EU *has* to go through a decently-thorough consultation and evidence-gathering process before legislating; they need to show that there is some problem, that their legislation will fix this problem, and that regional or national-level action won't be sufficient to tackle it effectively. That involves a lot of research, a lot of consulting, evidence-gathering, talking with experts and talking with legal experts (to make sure the draft law is constitutional). Often the Parliament will be involved in this process (so committees will submit recommendations, the whole Parliament might approve reports or communications and so on, so the Commission knows what the Parliament is thinking), but until the Commission has a draft there isn't an actual legal proposal to vote on (or amend etc.).

So while the Parliament doesn't draft the initial proposal, they will be involved in drafting it, and if they don't like the final version the Commission comes up with they'll send it back with proposed changes. But those might be more along the lines of ""we want the law to do [this] not [that]"" rather than ""change line 56 to say [this] not [that]"" - leaving it to the legal drafters to come up with the technical wording.

Something a lot of UK (and I think US) people don't get about the EU is that it is much more co-operative than our political systems. No political party has anywhere close to a majority in the Parliament (or on the Council), as each country has its own parties, and it is very rare that one of the EU-wide political groups has a majority. So they have to work together. The parties within the Parliament, the Parliament with the Council, the Commission with the Parliament and so on. It doesn't work perfectly, but they tend to be good at talking to each other and compromising where needed. Unlike the UK- and US- systems which are very combative and confrontational, with people picking sides, and fights between the different bodies (House v Senate, Congress v President, President v Courts, Party v Party).

Because the system is much more co-operative, it is less important that specific things need rules for them; the Parliament doesn't need the power to draft its own legislation from scratch because they know if they want something they can just ask the Commission, and the Commission will look into it for them."
AskReddit,fg76jt4,t1_fg73arm,1580585174.0,"It is true that the Governments of Member States have no direct way to propose legislation. Just in the same way that the State Governments in the US have no (real) way to propose Federal legislation. The national Governments are represented in the EU by the Council of the EU (mentioned above), and they don't have a mechanism to propose legislation.

But that's because they don't need one. The national governments each nominate someone for the Commission (although the Commissioner represents the EU as a whole, not their Member State), and the European Council (heads of government or state of Member States) meets fairly regularly, and the President of the Commission sits on that - so the national governments can ask for things to be done there (or through direct conversation with Commissioners).

>  But my examples would be parmesan cheese from Parma or the definition of champagne for the French. 

That's slightly different and a bit more complicated. Those are geographic indicators, which have been around for a while. Champagne was first legally restricted at the international level by an 1891 treaty. Since then restrictions on geographic indicators have become more popular around the world, but particularly in Europe. For example, there was a treaty in the 1950s between 7 European countries covering certain kinds of cheese, and some geographic indicators are included in NAFTA.

The first EU-level legislation for restricting geographic indicators was passed in 1992 (so pre-dates the current EU structure); only a few years before they were included in TRIPS (the WTO-level treaty, which came into force in 1995). Generally the EU has been a strong proponent of geographic indicators (with the US lagging behind - similar to the history of copyright, likely due to the US not having as many geographic indicators of its own to care about, while wanting to use other regions' indicators)."
AskReddit,fg70shm,t1_fg6spbf,1580581326.0,"The argument is ""the European Parliament cannot propose legislation.""

This is arguably true. On paper the EU's ordinary legislative process begins with the Commission (executive branch) coming up with an idea for legislation and drafting something (after researching, consulting etc.). The legislation then goes before the European Parliament and Council of the EU (the two parts of the legislature), who get to debate, amend, approve or reject the legislation. If the Parliament and Council end up with a version they all agree on (and agree with the Commission), it becomes law.

But there is no way for an individual Member of the European Parliament (the directly-elected representatives of the people) to start a piece of legislation.

It would be as if all legislation in the US Congress had to start with the President (via a Federal Department, Agency etc.) drafting legislation, which would then go to the House and Senate (who would be free to amend it as they want). Except in a world where the President isn't elected (indirectly-ish in your weird way), but nominated by the States (in accordance with their own, internal process) and approved by the House. Except, in practice, the President is the candidate nominated by the political party which won the most seats in the last Parliamentary election (same way Prime Ministers are appointed in the UK).

So this sounds like a big problem; our elected representatives can't draft laws. Except:

1. Once a law starts, the Parliament is free to amend it as they want - including changing it completely,
2. The Commission doesn't work in isolation; they don't want to waste time, so they talk to the Parliament (and Council), find out what kind of legislation the Parliament and Council want, will listen to advisory statements issued by the Parliament, and will draft laws they think will pass the Parliament or that the Parliament wants,
3. There is a formal process by which the Parliament can ask the Commission to come up with a legislative proposal (I don't think it has ever been needed - if the Parliament wanted something, the Commission would probably look into it without needing the formal order),
4. Ultimately, if the Parliament doesn't think the Commission is doing what they want, the Parliament can vote the Commission out of office (and then they get to vote on the replacement Commission).
5. The Commission itself is democratic; they are nominated by the national governments (via their own internal process - the UK could have had elections for their Commission nominees if they'd wanted), and have to be approved by a vote in the Parliament. The President is chosen based on the results of the Parliamentary elections (with candidates, Presidential debates, platforms and all that).

In places like the US and UK, legislation starts with individual members of the legislature, for historical reasons. But increasingly that is just a formality; in practice legislation is often drafted by the executive branch (especially in the UK), as they have the experts on researching what laws are needed and how to draft them. In the UK, Private Members' Bills (legislation proposed by individual MPs or Lords, rather than Government Bills, drafted by the executive) rarely pass. If they do, it is usually because the executive has got on board with it and - often - has proposed amendments to 'fix' any problems (often Private Members' Bills are badly-written, or written directly by lobby groups). The main use for Private Members' Bills is to raise an issue and debate it. Most don't get beyond that stage (to actual votes). The European Parliament doesn't need to waste legislative time to do this; being a more modern body, they don't have to use the formal legislative process simply to hold debates.

But the biggest difference between the EU legislative process and the US's or UK's is competence.

The UK Parliament can (in theory) pass any law it wants to. So if an MP comes up with a law, and it passes through Parliament, it is fine.

In the US, the US Congress has some limits on what laws it can pass (in the Constitution); so it is a bit more important that someone check any bill to see if it is constitutional. But if not, it's not that big a deal; the courts can sort it out fairly easily.

In the EU, the EU can only legislate in very narrow circumstances. It has to be in an area of law the EU has jurisdiction, the law has to be evidence-based and proportionate, and it has to be an issue where only EU-level legislation can work (national or regional action won't be enough to fix the problem). There are a lot more constitutional restrictions on the laws the EU can pass. And so it makes a lot more sense that laws start with the experts (who can check the law is constitutional) before going out to the legislature (to approve, amend and/or reject it); it saves a lot of time.

But all of this is hard to get over in a debate. Much harder than ""the Parliament can't propose legislation, so the EU is undemocratic."" Technically the first part is true. But it doesn't matter, as it misses all the context."

AskReddit,fg6n3ac,t1_fg6fjx3,1580572233.0,"That's an interesting argument, and it's a good example of some of the problems the UK has had with the EU.

It's a standard line that comes up again and again in discussions about the EU. But while it has some level of truth to it, it shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how the EU (and UK) legislative processes work, and the nature of the EU. It's the kind of argument that ""feels"" right - and if you see a list of arguments against the EU, might resonate with you - but if you think about it for a while and do some research, completely falls apart. It is a great meme-level argument; simple, obvious, easy to spread, hard to stop or counter.

Interestingly, a lot of the ""memes"" about the EU like this one were developed by Boris Johnson in the 80s. After he was fired from the Times for lying, Johnson got a job at the Telegraph through a friend. Given Johnson's background (he grew up in Brussels, his father working for the EU), the Telegraph decided to keep him out of the way, where he couldn't do any damage, by sending him to Brussels to be their EU correspondent. At the time, EU politics was seen as very dry, boring and technical - no one really cared about it.

But Johnson created a new style of ""reporting."" His columns were written in a particularly familial and almost condescending style, in which he made stuff up that played into the prejudices and interests of his readers (such as tropes about the French or Germans, about how foreigners couldn't get things done and were all useless, about excessive red tape and extravagant bureaucrats). And his columns were very popular among a certain section of the British public. To the point where other papers started copying that style.

And what we ended up with (after 30 years of that) was a whole load of ""cultural knowledge"" about the EU; things that we take to be true (that it is undemocratic, overly bureaucratic, wasteful etc.) even if those things are not remotely true any more (some may have been back in the 80s). And that is very hard to argue against; how do you explain to people that the EU Government is as democratic (if not more democratic) than the UK Government when ""everyone knows"" that it is undemocratic? How do you explain that the EU spends very little money, and has very little power when ""everyone knows"" that the EU has a huge budget and throws vast sums of money at pointless, silly schemes?"

A chunk of the UK financial industry is based on the fact that you can use it to get money from the EU to these tax havens without going through any special checks or tax points (something that the EU is in the process of changing).

explainlikeimfive,ffwq6zw,t3_ev9hqf,1580308326.0,"Magnetic fields do not have poles, they go in loops. Magnets will line themselves up so their loops are going the same way. When we talk about magnetic poles we are ignoring the part of the loop that goes through the magnetic object. It comes from an earlier model of magnetism, which gives the wrong answer for magnetic fields inside things, but works pretty well outside things.

[This neat diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geomagnetisme.svg) shows how the Earth's magnetic field lines work; they go through the middle of the Earth, out in the Southern Hemisphere, and loop around to go back into the Earth in the Northern Hemisphere. [The ""g"" poles are the geographic poles, so due to the Earth's rotation, and the ""m"" ones are the magnetic poles.]

The exact shape of this field depends on the structure of all the stuff inside the Earth (which is generating this field); but a lot of that stuff is in liquid form (or, at least, has liquidy properties) so moves around, and that causes shifts in the field lines. They sort of flow around.

So what do we mean by a ""magnetic North pole"" given that there aren't really magnetic poles, just loops?

The Magnetic North Pole is defined as the point on the Earth's surface where the magnetic field lines are travelling straight down into the ground (not at some angle). If you held a magnet there, the North part of it would point straight down. Anywhere else it would be slightly tilted. [Note - this means the magnetic North pole is actually a magnetic ""south"" pole - i.e. a thing that north poles are attracted to.]

As the inside of the Earth moves around a bit, its magnetic field will shift, and so this point will flow around a bit. It [used to be around Canada, but in the last few years has moved close to the geographic North, and is now heading off towards Russia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Magnetic_North_Pole_Positions_2015.svg).

We can define the ""magnetic South pole"" in a similar way (the point on the Earth's surface where magnetic field lines go straight up), but there is no reason why it should be directly opposite to the magnetic North pole; they're actually a bit off as the field isn't symmetric.

There are also the *geo*magnetic North and South poles. If we pretend the Earth's magnetic field is caused by a bar magnet (it isn't, but we can approximate it), those are where we would put the ends of the bar magnet.

Having said that, the Earth's magnetic field [is quite a bit more complicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geodynamo_Between_Reversals.gif) (that is a computer model of the magnetic field).

If you are interested. Wikimedia has some handy maps (from 2014 - so out of date now) showing [how the magnetic field strength varies across the Earth's surface](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/World_Magnetic_Field_2015.pdf) (stronger near the poles, weaker near the Equator), [how the inclination of the field varies](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/World_Magnetic_Inclination_2015.pdf) (0 degrees is where the field is perfectly horizontal, 90 degrees where it is vertical - so at the magnetic poles), and [how the declination of the field varies](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/World_Magnetic_Declination_2015.pdf) (so how wrong your compass is - the angle between the direction a compass would point and the geographic North or South pole; 0 degrees it is pointing in the right direction)."

There are three Ignition keywords; [Long], [Medium] and [Close]. To get the first two you need an upgrade card. But ships with Special Firing Arcs always have the [Close] one.

This tells the ship where it can place the Ignition Token. So a ship with an Ignition [Long] upgrade can place their token either within long range *or* close range of their ship.

The furthest the token can be from the Onager is the end of long range. Meaning if any enemy ship is in the Onager's Special Firing Arc it must be at most long range from the token (because it must be between the token and Onager). Which lets the Onager shoot it - but with red dice only.

But if that happens the Onager player has probably messed up; they should have seen that ship coming and placed their token either at close range, or at the closest part of long range (which would probably give close or medium range to the back of the enemy ship)."

2. When that ship comes to do its attacks, its first attack **must** (if able) be an Ignition Attack.

3. Ignition Attacks work the same as normal ship-to-ship attacks (range, arc, line of sight, attack effects such as Concentrate Fire commands, upgrade cards) except the defending hull zone **must be in the Special Firing Arc** (not just that hull zone's firing arc), and the defender can be beyond long range.

4. When gathering the initial dice pool for the attack you use the Special Battery Armament (not the Front Battery Armament - so no Spinals), rather than picking them based on the range (hull zone to hull zone), pick them based on the range **from the ignition token** to **any hull zone on the defender**.

5. After performing an Ignition attack, or at the end of the attack step, **remove the Ignition Token** from play.

Yes, but that's not enough.

Even if there were reasonable grounds to think Hunter Biden had broken the law (which there weren't), and grounds to announce an investigation into him (which there aren't), that still might make President Trump's actions a crime.

There are two parts to the Federal bribery law (18 USC 201) - the first is the ""quid pro quo"" part (promising something in return for something) but the second part is doing so ""corruptly."" Even if what President Trump was offering was perfectly legal and reasonable, and even if what he was asking for was perfectly legal and reasonable, *if he had corrupt intent he still committed a crime.*

And this is where we have to look into President Trump's intent - based on his actions. He did this secretly, he had evidence covered up or classified, he lied about it, he had this done through secret back-channels (using his personal lawyer and various petty criminals, it seems). He's obstructed any attempt to investigate this (itself a crime) by refusing to had over evidence, ordering people not to comply with subpoenas, ordering people not to testify and so on.

Secondly, he's never shown any interest in an actual investigation (nor have any of the people supporting him). This stuff happened back in 2014; the Republican-controlled House of Representatives had several years to launch investigations into him (and we know how happy they were to investigate anything that might be remotely of political consequence). The Republican-controlled Senate has had years to open an investigation. The Republican-controlled FBI has had the last couple of years to investigate this (and the last year with corruption-personified AG Barr in charge).

And yet they haven't investigated, or if they have, found nothing worth reporting.

There is nothing *itself* wrong with a President - either directly or through his officials - asking a foreign leader to carry out an investigation. But when the President does this through secret, unofficial channels, shows no interest in the actual investigation (just the announcement of it), and tries to cover it all up, that looks suspicious.

And all that is assuming there were reasons to think Hunter Biden might have been involved in corruption (which there weren't)."
StarWarsArmada,ffezloe,t3_et19st,1579871460.0,"A few thoughts:

**Intel Officer** is good, but **Lando** is important on a MC75 drop-ship; it helps keep it from being damaged too badly before it can activate.

**Expanded Launchers** sound great, but they only affect the front and are expensive. **External Racks** only work once, but work anywhere, and are a lot cheaper. Particularly with Raddus MC75s, you want to drop in, do an overwhelming (hopefully) amount of damage, then fly off. Racks are good for that.

The MC75, particularly with Raddus, really needs **Electronic Countermeasures**. Its tokens aren't great, and a single accuracy can really ruin its day (particularly against Vader ISD2s). ECMs means you can get that brace off at least once a round.

As noted above, **Admonition** is usually the preferred choice for MC30s. Foresight is nice (and better against Onagers when they arrive), but tends to work best with Mon Mothma. ECMs are a little redundant on a ship with double tokens; EWS is a nice defensive option, or even RBDs (but they're hard to pull off effectively). Again, repeating what is above, XI7s are neat, but you want everyone or no one to have them. They work nicely with Keyan Farlander, but you don't want to be pushing through a bunch of damage into one hull zone with the MC30, and then hit the same place with the MC75 only to have the damage redirected away.

If you're going with a **Hammerhead** anyway, why not switch it to a Torpedo, stick on Ordnance Experts and/or External Racks, and use the Profundity title? It loses you an activation in the early game, but helps a lot when you are first player (giving you a solid punch from the Raddus drop). Cham can be fun as well.

**Repair Crews** is one of those luxury cards, if you have a couple of flotillas and don't need a second normal card. Comms Net is the default, but on this list perhaps Slicer Tools could be fun? You could also put Boosted Comms on it, so Bright Hope can hang back and still push the squadrons.

There's a weird anti-synergy between Luke and Keyan Farlander; Luke ignores shields (so leaves them up), Keyan wants to shoot things without shields. Maybe Ten Numb? Maybe even Hera, to make Wedge terrifying?

**Dangerous Territory** is a bit risky with only 2-3 ships on the table at the start of the game. Against a dual ISD2 list it is probably safe, but against swarm lists it might suffer. Navigational Hazards could be interesting. Solar Corona is the ""default"" or ""safe"" Blue objective."
bestof,ffdr8df,t1_ffdarva,1579826968.0,"So despite what you might have heard about him, Sanders's policies aren't that big a change. They do switch around some of the US's current economic policies (which focus more on helping the rich at the expense of the poorer), but aren't really that different. They involve some increases in taxation, and some shifts in spending priorities.

This isn't likely to need an increase in policing. Taking away money from rich people may need a lot more lawyering than taking it from poorer people (who can't afford their own lawyers), but it tends not to need that much force (as richer people have more to lose if they get in trouble, and tend to get less desperate than those without much to begin with who find themselves on the wrong side of the law).

Sanders's taxation policies may sound radical to the average person in the US, but to the rest of the world they're not all that special. Some rich people will put more effort into avoiding taxation, but most will just pay it and grumble a bit - they can afford it, after all.

These take place during a hologram conference about an hour into RotS, which we see from the perspective of Mace Windu (on Coruscant) with Yoda, Ki-Adi-Mundi and Aayla Secura remotely, just after Obi-Wan starts fighting General Grevious.

In the trailer it looks like we're seeing that scene from the other side - so either Ki-Adi-Mundi or Aayla's perspective, as both Mace and Yoda are holograms, and the background looks like a Republic ship (or perhaps Ahsoka is listening in, but not visible herself due to not being a proper Jedi?).

Note that the establishing shot in the trailer (of a conference room) doesn't quite fit the RotS scene (wrong room, Yoda there in person, extra people there remotely), so that may be from a separate moment. Or they've just taken some artistic licence.

So yes, it seems likely the final story arc of The Clone Wars will run alongside Revenge of the Sith, probably crossing over in a few places. Which makes sense; we would want to see how Ahsoka survives Order 66 (even if there is a version of that in the novel).

Of course it does, otherwise it wouldn't matter how the Beast behaves towards the father in Act 1 because by the time we get to Act 2 and Act 3, that is his previous nature.

The Beast isn't entirely a good guy by 21st century standards either. But he isn't the bad guy either. He is the flawed protagonist, who is able to find redemption for his flaws by improving himself.

Not sure she'd count as a whore for living in the same castle as the Beast (initially under force), but yes, she is a disobedient woman and a snob. A large part of the opening song is the locals explaining that Belle is weird. Part of the Gaston-Belle plotline is on how she is disobedient, talks back, and doesn't behave appropriately for a woman in that position - but she is beautiful enough (and Gaston self-centred enough) that he doesn't care and just wants to own her.

Her arrogance is a bit problematic, as is her Manic Pixie Dreamgirl-ness, but you can see what they were trying to do with her as a character.

But let's get back to the main point - you were complaining that the Beast doesn't face consequences for imprisoning Maurice. But that's not quite true. The Beast imprisons Maurice for trespassing because the Beast is ""spoiled, selfish, and unkind"" and has ""no love in his heart."" And the Beast does get punished for that - he gets turned ""into a hideous beast.""

The purpose of that sequence is partly to advance the plot, but also to show us (rather than us just having to rely on the narration) that the Beast is a bad person, and so deserving(ish) of the punishment he received. He was punished for being bad, and then we get to see that he is still bad - very little he does with Maurice initially turns on him being in Beast-form (you can imagine non-Beast prince doing that as well).

The Beast is turned into a monster for being monstrous. But initially that doesn't help - he just keeps doing bad things (and we are told he has ""[fallen] into despair, and lost all hope""). Which is the point; it's not until Belle turns up and starts treating him like a person (both in terms of looking past his monstrous form, but also in terms of calling him out for his beastly inside) that he changes as a person.

But let's say he wasn't in such a State. Would you argue, then, that the Beast's reasonable/moral course of action would have been to detain Maurice only as long as it took the local police to arrive and arrest him?

> a young woman falling for a man who has trapped her in his castle.

This is not what happens.

Belle goes to the castle willingly. Once there she chooses to take her father's place (admittedly, under duress). She stays less than a night before the scene in the West Wing, where the Beast shouts at her and she runs away.

> Promise or no promise, I can't stay here another minute.

That is not a person who feels they are being held by force. That is someone who feels obliged to stay in the castle due to a promise.

Belle gets in trouble (wolves), the Beast comes to rescue her, and that's the first time she expresses real sympathy for him. She has the means and opportunity to escape, and could do so, but recognises the Beast's humanity and brings him back to the castle to help him [the mid-point in the film].

It's only after she returns, voluntarily, to the castle (only bound by her promise - that she was already willing to break) that she begins to fall for the Beast. That act ends when the Beast tells her to leave, and releases her from what little is left of her promise to stay. He does so immediately after seeing that she might want to go. Her last line in that scene:

> Thank you for understanding how much he needs me.

She leaves, stuff happens, she comes back and realises that she does kind of love him. The timing is important. She doesn't fall for him until she is no longer trapped in the castle.

> he is verbally abusive and suffers from extreme anger issues

Yes, at the beginning. And that's kind of the point of the film. **The film is not about a girl trapped in a castle who falls for a monster. It is about a man who, with the help of a girl, learns to be a better person, one capable of loving and being loved.** [It also has a theme of monsters and men, comparing the Beast and Gaston, but that's not really relevant here.]

The Beast starts off with anger issues, a temper he can't really control, and is verbally abusive to everyone. But *he changes*.

The two big moments in the film are when Belle leaves the Beast; the first time because he shouted at her and lost his temper (inappropriate, but understandable in the circumstances), the second when he tells her to go. Between those two the Beast grows as a person, prompted by Belle's presence. The washing-cuts scene is probably the transition scene for this, where the Beast is still angry and has a temper problem (again, kind of understandable given the pain he is in), but gradually controls it, with help from Belle:

> Belle: If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much.

> Beast: Well if you hadn't run away, this wouldn't have happened!

> Belle: Well if you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away!

> Beast: Well you shouldn't have been in the West Wing!

> Belle: Well you should learn to control your temper! ... By the way, thank you, for saving my life.

> Beast: You're welcome.

See how that works? He is angry, she is angry, they fight, but he learns to control his temper... after she tells him to. It's really quite explicit.

He learns to control his temper, he learns to empathise (""understanding how much [her father] needs [her]""), he becomes a better person, and Belle notices; ""there's something in him that [she] simply didn't see"" - she didn't see it before because it wasn't there, or at least, was buried and she has helped bring it out of him. As she explains to her father: ""...he's different, now.  He's changed somehow.""

Which isn't to say there aren't problematic elements to it; for example, Belle has a bit of Manic Pixie Dream Girl about her, but even though she is the catalyst for the Beast's growth, it's not really because she tries to change him, more that her being around gives him the opportunity to learn empathy. He changes because he wants to, not because she ""fixes"" him.

The Beast grows as a person. From an arrogant, selfish monster with a temper problem, to a gentle, empathetic, selfless(ish) man capable of loving and being loved.

[Again, throw in the contrast against Gaston - who also tries to force Belle into doing things (marrying him), also locks up Belle, but does so for entirely selfish reasons, and doesn't try to change.]

-----------------------

>  It is my belief that the only reason this movie gets praise for any reason is due to extreme Disney nostalgia.

So, let's assume you are right about the problematic nature of Belle and the Beast's relationship. I don't think this conclusion is valid either, and the big piece of evidence to support that is just how much praise the film got *when it was released*.

Beauty and the Beast won 2 Oscars in 1992 (Original Song, Original Score), 2 Golden Globes, and a whole host of other major awards. It was nominated for 4 other Oscars, and was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture (the next was *Up* in 2009, after the number of nominees was increased). It won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture, Comedy or Musical (again, first animated film - The Lion King and Toy Story 2 also winning, before the categories were changed in 2007).

It is a really good film. Most of the awards were for the music (which is fantastic), but the film comes together very well. The script, the editing, the acting etc., but also the animation which is amazing, both the visuals/background shots, but also the character animation - one of the problems the live-action film suffers from is that their CGI Beast isn't nearly as expressive as the animated one - the animation is able to convey so much emotion for the Beast.

-------------

*Edit*: In case anyone else is interested here is another key thing. From the introduction (where we are told the points of the film):

> Although he had everything his heart desired, the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind. ... [The enchantress] had seen that there was no love in his heart, and as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast. ... If he could learn to love another, and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken.

The story is the Beast's story. And how he can go from being spoiled, selfish, unkind and incapable of love, to generous, selfless, kind, and capable of both loving and being loved.

He learns generosity, kindness and selflessness, and learns how to love (and Belle notices the change ""There's something sweet / And almost kind / But he was mean / And he was coarse and unrefined. / But now he's dear / And so unsure, / I wonder why I didn't see it there before""). But the curse isn't lifted *until Belle loves him back* - and that doesn't happen until after the final battle. As the Beast grows and becomes a better person, Belle looks more kindly on him, but it isn't until the end that she finally falls in love with him (after she is no longer under his power, in his castle, being held against her will or even bound by a promise to stay)."

One of the clearest examples of this (although I don't know how well-researched it is) is their inability to cope with eucalyptus leaves when not attached to a tree. If you give a koala a pile of eucalyptus leaves on a plate it will ignore them, even if hungry, as it doesn't understand what to do. If you want to hand-feed them you have to give them a whole branch.

There's some evidence that koalas (or their ancestors) used to have more developed brains, but have evolved to be simpler - they don't need much thinking to hunt down eucalyptus leaves, and simpler brains use far less energy which helps when their diet is limited."

Also relevant, from the FAQ:

> Q: When a ship executes a maneuver, does it move along the maneuver tool?

> A: No. The ship is picked up from its starting position and placed in its final position. It ignores any obstacles, ships, and squadrons that its base does not overlap in its final position.

So as soon as any part of the ship (other than shield dials) goes outside the Play Area it is destroyed. Engine Techs lets you do an extra maneuver after your main one, but you still have to land in between them (e.g. for overlapping ships, squadrons or obstacles, and for any ""after you perform a maneuver"" effects).

The problem with corruption by President Trump, those around him, and the Trump Organization is that there are so many stories they tend to get buried under new ones.

This was a fairly minor story back in 2016 (the Trump Organization being paid $2-5m to help out a money laundering scheme involving corrupt Azerbaijani officials, and linked with the Iranian military. It was just one of the many seemingly-corrupt businesses President Trump has been connected to. It's only come back up now because President Trump personally ordered the assassination of Solemeini."
bestof,fdgu1qd,t1_fdgmhpj,1578408318.0,"I have a feeling we may be getting beyond the scope of Reddit discussions and into legal territory. The article linked above suggests there is a very low threshold for prosecutions under this sort of foreign corruption stuff, but you are saying it is a high one, and unfortunately I don't know enough about these specific laws to work out which is true. Skimming the [SEC guidance](https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/fcpa/fcpa-resource-guide.pdf) I think the key difference may be that you are focusing on corruption by the senior figures at the Trump Organization (who are probably corrupt but clueless idiots) rather than the people actually involved in the scheme in Azerbaijan. But that doesn't help, because the Trump Organization can still be liable for the crimes committed by its agents, and for aiding, conspiring etc. with the people in Azerbaijan to commit the crimes.

> How many US companies have been prosecuted in the 45 years since the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was passed?

Well the Wikipedia page gives a few examples of multi-million-dollar fines and other cases, including Siemans, HP, News Corporation, Walmart, BAE, Monsanto, Halliburton.

And again, so what if other companies are doing it; that doesn't make it Ok for the Trump Organization to do so.

I get where you are coming from comparing the ""Trump is a traitor"" thing to the Birther Conspiracies. The problem with that is that every time anyone looked into the birther stuff, the evidence contradicted it. And yet with President Trump, and the Trump Organization, so many of the allegations keep ending up being true (or at least, as verifiable as possible). If it was just one incident, maybe that might be a coincidence or conspiracy theory, but it keeps happening. In this case, again, it seems the Azerbaijan group tried to get a bunch of US businesses involved in their corruption/money laundering scheme, and yet it was only the Trump Organization that took the bait.

I don't think President Trump wants to destroy the US. But I think he would be happy to do so (and has shown himself willing to take actions against the interests of the US, its Government and its people) if it helped him personally. And this story is just another example supporting that."

As for the ""they should have known better"", yes - they should have. And not knowing better *is a crime* in many places, including the US.

When working on big foreign investment projects it isn't enough for the company to wave their hands and say ""well, I didn't know they were all corrupt because I didn't bother to investigate or think about it too much;"" some of the offences apply even without knowledge. Which is why so much effort is put into background checks and due diligence - because not doing it can lead to serious criminal liability.

So it seems either the Trump Organization didn't carry out the proper background checks and thus negligently profited from the money laundering scheme (which is usually a crime), or they did carry them out and went ahead with it anyway (definitely a crime)."

Firstly, you can, and you do. Secondly, they did a lot more than license the Trump name. From the article linked above:

He said that Trump staff visited Baku at least monthly to give the go-ahead for the next round of work orders... The hotels main designer, Pierre Baillargeon, and several contractors told me that they had visited the Trump Organization headquarters, in New York, to secure approval for their plans.

> In October, 2014, [Ivanka Trump] visited the city to tour the site and offer advice. An executive at Mace, the London-based construction firm that oversaw the towers conversion to a hotel, met with Ivanka in Baku and New York. He told me, She had very strong feelings, not just about the design but about the back of the hotellandscaping, everything. The Azerbaijani lawyer said, Ivanka personally approved everything. ... On her Web site, Ivanka posted a photograph of herself wearing a hard hat inside the half-completed hotel. A caption reads, Ivanka has overseen the development of Trump International Hotel & Tower Baku since its inception, and she recently returned from a trip to the fascinating city in Azerbaijan to check in on the projects progress.

Who is leaping now? You deny being a Trump apologist and yet assume the most-favourable-to-Trump facts, without checking anything.

As for the ""everyone is corrupt, so it is Ok if Trump is"" argument (never heard that one before...) that is where the concept of ""due diligence"" comes in. Businesses generally aren't liable for their involvement in money laundering schemes provided they at least try to check that's not what is happening. And this project involved a lot of red flags - many of which are highlighted in the articles above, and based on publicly available information (never mind the kind of professional investigations that should happen for a project of this size). No other US business got involved in it - despite the sums of money being offered and number approached. And yet the Trump Organization did; so either their due diligence somehow missed all the red flags, or they didn't carry it out, or they knew and didn't care (""knowingly or through wilful ignorance"")."

There's some evidence (based on the size of their skulls and fossil records) suggesting that their ancestors did have more developed brains, but over time they have evolved to be less intelligent.

It's a great example of how evolution doesn't care about goals or specific traits such as intelligence; sometimes the better-suited organism is the less intelligent one (brains use a lot of energy, so if you are in an environment with limited resources, but which are easy to access, losing some brain power is probably better for survival)."
bestof,fdf2ugd,t1_fdeynei,1578352040.0,"So... Let's break it down further.

The Trump Organization was paid $2-5million to act as a front for this construction project in Azerbaijan.

They do that to bring an air of respectability to the project. Making it look like a genuine hotel/luxury apartment complex rather than a money laundering scheme.

That helps gets the project investors and keeps money flowing into the project (even though it is never going to pay out); after all, if the ""big, successful American company"" has their name on it, it must be important.

That money is then funnelled into various contractors and subcontractors, often in cash (so hard to trace).

So let's say Solemeini wants to pay someone a lot of money to help get ICBM parts. They can't just buy them, because of sanctions and so on. So instead, they pay the money to their corrupt friends in Azerbaijan. They then use that money to invest in the fake Trump hotel project. The Trump hotel project pays that money (along with the ""legitimate investments"") to various contractors, some of whom who then pay it to whoever has the ICBM parts (or more likely, the contractors pay the money to someone else, who pays it to someone else and so on, until it eventually gets to the ICBM-related manufacturers). And with everyone involved taking their cut.

The point is to have a complicated chain of people handling the money, and for the payments to be mixed in with a whole load of other money, making it hard to trace (both in the sense of knowing who has paid whom, and also in the legal sense of being able to track it down for seizure etc.).

So the Trump Organization is either knowingly, or through wilful ignorance, being paid to help cover for a money laundering scheme, one of whose goals may have been to help secure long-range missile technology for the Iranian military."
