dogs,fewmtoz,t3_eqpoak,1579415043.0,"Oh my goodness! What an adorable ordeal!

If it was my dog I might try to introduce him to some other high quality dog food product that might be more valuable than butter? (Fish skin sticks a from pet valu work well for my dude - also contains fat that maybe your dog is drawn to from butter?). Maybe a really quality bone chew thing with lots of fat content? Maybe it’s a texture thing!

 I’d try giving him special dog food snacks with more fat in it if that’s what he’s drawn to enough that he’s trying to snuffle it into a couch. What funny creatures they are!

Good luck! Please update on what works! Hiding the butter will work but it’s not ideal because (if you’re anything like me) you like having it ready and available on the counter!"

dogs,fdiuiov,t1_fdidbcl,1578451336.0,"^that. We are working on the first methods - wait until he stops barking, and then praise with “good quiet” and pats. it’s a slow process and it takes patience, but little by little he is calming down with the barks. We were trying treats whenever he was quiet, but I think that confused him into thinking “oh, if I bark first I get a treat”. He’s too smart for his own good. Haha.

Sleepparalysis,fc7hxbf,t3_eggzzr,1577507969.0,"I had sleep paralysis while on a business trip in the UK, every night for a week straight during the heat wave that took place this past summer. I was already well adjusted to the time zone, so that wasn’t a factor. I heard voices and saw shadows - the voices were saying in a really mocking voice “welcome to the (hotel I was staying at) sleep experiment. You’re going to wish you were awake!” And then it got crazier - a lot of scary sounds and sensations like someone was pulling me off of the bed or pulling the sheets off.  Typical scary sleep paralysis stuff. That shit was scary. One of the voices told the others “shut up, this bitch is trying to call her husband! What a stupid bitch! She can’t even talk!” (I was trying to tell Siri to dial my husband. I didn’t know what else to do, lol. It kept coming out as mumbles until I finally got released from the paralysis by saying “HEY SIRI”. The voice responded with “THAT’S MORE LIKE IT” and then I woke up.

Nothing since that week in early August. I just started sleeping on my back again. Biggest WTF experience I’ve ever had. Yours sounds similar to other experiences with a top hat man, which is super creepy.

Never had an experience since!"
