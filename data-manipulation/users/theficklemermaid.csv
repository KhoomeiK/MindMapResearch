AmItheAsshole,ffa1mx1,t3_esh2ud,1579726074.0,YTA. You know that your parents are homophobic so don’t bring a bisexual person around them presumably without warning her and then fail to defend her when they attack her entire identity then patronisingly apologise on her behalf when she dares to express emotion about being attacked and abandoned by her partner. You put her through this and should be apologising to her on behalf of not only your family but yourself.
AmItheAsshole,ff9scue,t3_esgfvp,1579720168.0,YTA for the way you went about it. As a donor you sign away rights and responsibilities so don’t really have an obligation to interact with any of the resulting children but to meet with all of them except the one you judge unworthy of your attention is obviously uncaring of you and upsetting for him. Seems like you didn’t do this for the right reasons to help people but because the thought of producing successful children was an ego boost and you didn’t consider that they are human beings in their own right with feelings that are affected by your actions. I understand that you disagree with his choices but he could be struggling with issues of identity and now rejection related to growing up without a father and now knowing you are out there but refused to see him. You have the choice to be a positive or negative influence on the situation.
AmItheAsshole,ff93ub9,t3_escnnl,1579704187.0,"YTA. Why would you not tell him about such a huge part of his history and identity? As well as the emotional implications, this could have practical implications such as him not knowing half of his family medical history etc. Unless you are leaving out some massive detail, I cannot understand the bizarre decision that you and his biological father made for his biological father to stop being in his life after three years just because you married someone else. Step parent families are normal. Living a lie is not normal. I cannot imagine why all the adults involved thought this was a normal or reasonable thing to do to a child. Although your son will not remember it now, I would be surprised if he wasn’t distressed at the time when his father suddenly disappeared after previously having been involved in his life for three years, a child in my family went through some time apart from his father due to some difficult circumstances and was distressed by it at an even younger age. Children are affected by disruption to their routine and relationships even at an early age. And lying to him all his life will of course have had an impact. How did you expect him to react? His feelings are understandable and all you can do is acknowledge that."
CatfishTheTVShow,ff66l56,t1_feouoyk,1579620362.0,"Exactly, I understand it can happen because sometimes people are concerned about a loved one who lacks perspective to take the first step to contact the show themselves or the relative writing in is the catfish that wants to come out like Carmen but when it becomes a theme rather than just something that happens you can see they are manipulating the circumstances to fit the plot. It’s like when Nev was pointing out a “catfish first” every episode, even the tiniest most irrelevant details!"
AmItheAsshole,ff4xwg6,t3_ernlmq,1579575092.0,"YTA. Surely in your 4 year search for this breed you read up on them and dogs in general? It takes longer than a couple of days to adjust to a new environment. He’s still a baby missing his mother, which will be reflected in his behaviour. And on your side adjusting to being responsible for an animal is a big lifestyle change. Persevere, get advice from a responsible trainer using positive methods and get into a routine. Take some time before making drastic decisions. If this isn’t for you then the dog may be better with someone else but I think two days is too soon to decide."
AmItheAsshole,ff1xoov,t3_er6rqs,1579488546.0,"NTA. I would have said that it was a bit excessive to take a photo and there could be an innocent explanation up until he lied about who he was with, which shows he has something to hide and might have been able to convince her you were wrong if you hadn’t had evidence. Saying that he said he was with the guys because he sees this woman as like one of the guys is a ridiculous excuse, it was clearly intended to deflect suspicion by implying he was out with a group of men rather than a lone woman. Even if he lied because he thinks your sister overreacts to things, rather than because he is actually cheating, that isn’t a solution because it will obviously make her more concerned when she finds out, those issues need to be resolved through honesty and clear communication. It’s not your fault because you didn’t cause the situation just bought it to her attention. Definitely sounds like there are things they needed to discuss."
AskReddit,fest1rf,t3_eqd6im,1579368741.0,"It’s quite important. I dated a guy once when we were in our early 20s and his parents were well off so he lived at home, they still paid most of his expenses, bought him clothes etc, gave him money whenever he asked and gave him a job with the family business that he couldn’t really have earned on merit alone. I’ve no problem with parents helping their adult children get a start in life but the issue was he didn’t seem to be going anywhere. He was a nice enough guy but no drive, no idea what he wanted to do for a career, content to just let his parents provide and I think they found that frustrating because they were hardworking but at the same time they enabled his attitude. That’s not the reason we didn’t stay together or anything, we were young and not serious anyway but it was a bit off putting. It’s hard to see a future with someone who isn’t working towards one. I’m married now and I do admire my husband’s ambition. It’s not that a partner has to be a workaholic or want to be a big shot, success doesn’t look the same to everyone but they should have passions they pursue and a drive to get something in life that someone else didn’t give to them."

AskReddit,fesk9jr,t3_eqify5,1579366109.0,"I don’t do it myself because I have dyspraxia/developmental coordination disorder which affects coordination and fine motor movements. So using sharp objects for precise and potentially painful processes close to my eyes would be a no-no and also it would be extremely difficult and frustrating to get them symmetrical. I don’t think they look that bad but I have a professional do it occasionally, like for an event, but not regularly because that does seem like an unnecessary expense so goes by the wayside if money is tight and I need to budget. It’s just not a priority."
AskReddit,fesi26x,t3_eqifjn,1579365326.0,"Total shock and disbelief at first. I was 12 and had just come home from school and was alone in the house when I heard it on the radio. I was too young to remember the first twin towers attack so it was hard to imagine something like that could happen but as I followed more media coverage I quickly realised it was real. I will never forget the images of those who desperately jumped from impossible heights rather than be consumed by the flames. It was my first exposure to a tragedy on that scale and it was almost beyond comprehension. I think that when I was young I was in a bubble where I was blissfully unaware of the possibility of terrorist attacks on western targets. Not that I didn’t care about bad things happening abroad but I never expected it to be something that could actually endanger me. My husband is a few years older and was born in London so he remembers the fear of IRA attacks but I grew up between that and the increase in Islamic extremism so 9/11 was the first time I realised something like that could happen. Of course that seems hard to believe nowadays, especially after the Manchester bombing, which was very close to home. You sort of dread and expect something like that now. I look back and think of listening to that radio announcement as the end of a sense of safety and naivety and the start of growing up in a scary new world."
AmItheAsshole,ferqywy,t3_eqgt3y,1579357338.0,"NTA. There is no cure for a virus, rest, rehydration and monitoring the situation for more serious symptoms are the right things to do. I think that your husband should talk to your MIL, it’s unfair for her to single you out and call you lax when he is the other parent and presumably agrees with the approach you are taking. He should show a united front against her attitude. He needs to be clear that he supports you and she should back off because she is not going to listen when you say it."

My father has passed so I can’t talk to him about it, I talked it through with my mother, I get they thought they were doing what was best by not telling me and I still love them and everything but it was a big shock because before that I would have said they were straightforward people and we didn’t have big family secrets."
