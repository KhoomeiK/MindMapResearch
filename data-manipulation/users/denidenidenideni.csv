IncelTears,ff97557,t1_ff8m33k,1579706413.0,"Not that I believe these incels are smart enough to know or think about this but, I think this us very different than how it was in Middle Eastern societies. There, peasant women were sold as young as 12 and raped by their “husbands”. Unfortunately, it is still (even though is illegal) happening in some rural parts of my country. My grandmother was married off at 15 and she gave birth to my aunt at just 16. My grandfather was 18 at the time, but I know usally girls were force to marry much older man with money and status and my grandparents version is not as common."
wholesomememes,fewa7cp,t1_few9mtl,1579407446.0,"Oh wow okay I actually had a lot of insecurities when I first started dating him. I still kind of do, and I don’t think I am particularly smart or accomplished or anything and I tend to be very self-deprecating. But he does see me that way and those are all what he constantly says to me. I didn’t notice it came off like I say those things about myself but honestly, I would be so damn happy if I could. I spent all my life hating myself for a lot of things."
wholesomememes,fevrswp,t1_fevmiht,1579400759.0,I think it is not the case. I am 20 and I do get compliments from other people regarding my looks rarely but i still love it when my boyfriend does it. He constantly shows and tells me how much he loves me for who I am and how proud he is of my accomplishments. I think as some others pointed out it is the matter of balance. I am aware he is not just dating me because he thinks I am hot or he only wants sex. So I see it as him showing me how attractive he finds me on top of everything else he loves me for.
wholesomememes,fevqnvz,t1_fev90qy,1579400348.0,I totally agree. My boyfriend constantly tells me how proud of me he is and talks about my intelligence to others. We go to different schools and when I visited him every one of his friends were like oh you must be the genius girlfriend. I think since he makes it constantly known he loves me for my other qualities I don’t see what he does as objectification and rather I see it as him showing his attraction towards me.
