According to the numbers given there, the flu kills somewhere around 3,000,000 to 6,000,000 people per decade. A few hundred thousand of those are likely in the US. It might not be a single flu virus, but it shows that even our run of the mill version of flu is still deadly.

The problem is that if you get a particularly nasty strain of flu, you end up with a medical system that can't keep up. Modern medical practices can only get you so far in that case. You only have so many beds, so much equipment and medicine, and so many staff. That's why you have so many people working to prevent these from becoming pandemics in the first place."

And parents are proud of their kids and want to show them off. It can be the same feeling as when you show off your computer build. I agree that reddit is maybe not the best place for it though. And that you need to be careful not to post things that may cause career issues for them in a decade or two (they'll probably post those themselves, to be honest)."

homeowners,ffh78we,t1_fffyooy,1579925079.0,">If it's an existing house that was not expanded, then they likely were not required to hook up to city sewer.

Some cities require you to hook up to the sewer when it becomes available. My mom had to fork over something like $6000+ in the 90s because Portland had just annexed the neighborhood and required sewer hookup. They also required disposal of the old septic system. Dunno what happened if you couldn't afford it, but I don't think she would have connected to the sewer if she'd had a choice."
homeowners,fffjvud,t1_ffezjwt,1579885539.0,"Yeah, the real danger is when homes will have unusual adjustments and discounts on the taxes. Every place I've lived offered discounts for elderly, so you'd sometimes look at taxes on a Zillow listing and it would be something like $300/year. That's why you need to look at multiple lots that share the same assessed value. Although you may be able to see if there are any discounts being applied when viewing someone's property taxes too. 

My previous city also capped property tax increases per year, so you'd also see stuff like homes worth half a million assessed at <$70k if the owner had lived there long enough. So assessed values could be *way* different from real estate values. Alternatively, my county does a reassessment every two years, so our assessed value now actually matches the real estate value, so that can happen too. Bit of a bummer really."
homeowners,ffeoge6,t1_ffenbtu,1579857352.0,"Most cities and counties will have a tool that lets you check lot info online, and that generally includes annual taxes. Check houses nearby with the same assessed value and see if they're around what you're expecting for your own home."

Maybe I'd have a $35 copay to get a steroid prescription, and then another few bucks for that and an antihistamine, but my damages would be pretty minimal. It's a localized allergic reaction. Unpleasant, but not threatening. I would have *maybe* missed a few days of work if I got bit on my foot, but that's the worst that I could see happening.

It does not show up on HP's instant ink portal though, otherwise I would have signed up for that while troubleshooting my printer."

assholedesign,fepux3r,t1_fepjyq3,1579332184.0,"I had the service up until my printer had a premature death recently. It actually isn't bad. They mail you ink before you ever run out, and you can rollover unused pages up to a point. They *very clearly* warn you when you cancel the service that your ink will stop working and need to be replaced.

It's also not really a rip off. I think I might have paid maybe $5 more a year using it, but it might have been less too. That said: it still wasn't enough for me to buy another HP printer. I bought a Canon that came with a 3 year warranty instead.

They probably signed up for the 3 months that come free and didn't pay any attention to what comes after that. The funny thing is that you have to install special instant ink cartridges that are mailed to you for the service, so they still should have known.

Either way, I'm gonna say this wasn't asshole design. Asshole design is the fact that these cartridges can hold so much ink, yet retail cartridges hold barely anything."

Everyone always assumes that employees will just read the evacuation procedure posted in the break room. Everyone also assumes incorrectly.

MaliciousCompliance,fcpg7do,t1_fcpf81z,1577862584.0,"It still shows up under the data plan FAQs. I changed my plan in August and was still able to keep it on there (initially added it a year and a half ago). It's independent of your plan.

There also weren't any plans available that included it for me, so my internet alone is $150/mo because of the stupid $50 extra I pay.

bestoflegaladvice,fcmqm4z,t1_fcm7lrz,1577787368.0,"I do it all the time in Washington. Sometimes it's the only way to make a turn. So long as I enter the intersection before the light is red, I can still legally make my turn even after it turns red. It's literally never caused an issue when I do it, so I don't get how it's dangerous or selfish.

In Oregon, it would be considered running a yellow, which they actually do issue citations for. One thing I loved about moving out of Oregon was no longer having to worry about getting caught by a yellow light. No one slams on their brakes to stop for a light here."

Honestly, I don't like that we punish people with addictions anyway, so I really don't care if most people decide to do recreational drugs."

But I'm more in agreement with the other posters: the real issue here is that we're talking 10 pills. That's on top of driving without a license. Neither are responsible behaviors. I just wouldn't trust LAOP as a nurse."

The law could be changed to make small quantities of recreational drugs legal to possess and use, but it's not hard to just not do that thing that would bar you from nursing school too."

vancouverwa,fckpmg4,t3_ehoztf,1577730463.0,"The only ones we found two years ago were New Tradition and Lennar. Pacific Lifestyle has a branch called Garrette Custom Homes that can modify plans to put on your own lot, but they were pricier. Lennar looked like they used lower quality materials even in their model homes, which worried me a bit.

We ended up buying an existing home and adding a second master suite downstairs. It was built off an existing bonus room which we turned into my parents' living area. They've got that, bedroom, bath with laundry, and walk in closet. We didn't add a kitchenette, but there's space for it. The new addition cost us $90k after tax. Probably a bit higher than it needed to be. It saved us about $100k though."
