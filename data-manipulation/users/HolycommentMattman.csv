Jokes,ffxo8p0,t1_ffxadkt,1580329148.0,"All right, let me try one.

So a Czech man and his black attendant are out hunting. They had no luck and were heading back homr when they were attacked by a large male bear. The bear knocked down the attendant, who watched in horror as his master was swallowed in one gulp.

Terrified, he ran back to town to get help and told them how his master might still be alive because he had been swallowed whole by the bear.

So they put together a hunting party and went looking for the bear. Finding it, they killed it and cut it open, but the man was nowhere to be found.

A female bear then attacked them, clearly enraged by the death of her mate. 

They killed her, and screaming could be heard from inside. They cut her open, and there was the Czech man.

The moral: never trust a black man when he says the Czech is in the male."
worldnews,ffxegeg,t1_ffx0wx6,1580323486.0,"So first of all, I said it's often higher than the flu shot efficacy. Definitely not always. There have been several years where the efficacy of the flu shot is 10% or less. 

Also, their data on the flu shot is cheating a little bit. One or two years ago, the flu shot was so abysmally low that they put out a second one. That's kinda cheating if you ask me. 

And there have been numerous studies done about the efficacy of masks. There are several links floating around here in the comments proving such. 

As for why they would distribute the flu shot over masks? Well, when the flu shot is most effective, it easily outstrips masks. But why not cover as many bases as possible? Every little bit helps."
worldnews,ffwdwx0,t1_ffwd4g6,1580297191.0,"Was it? The only thing I see him mention with any technical detail is the Coronavirus (2019 ncov). Aside from that, he just seems to be saying masks aid to stop a sick person from spreading not keep a healthy person from being infected.

And while I will admit that it's absolutely true that they're more effective for decreasing transmission, they are, at the very least, minimally effective in decreasing reception of airborne illnesses. To a point that it's insane to tell only sick people to wear them.

Even if it's only 1 in 100, that's a great use of ten cents. But like I said, it's usually along the lines of a 10-30% reduction. And that's not negligible.

And that's just an average, mind you. In clinical studies where people use masks correctly, some strains of flu reduced reception by 80%. 

Type of mask usually doesn't matter. But masks help. And a biologist should know that."
worldnews,ffwcxop,t1_ffw5sl2,1580295908.0,"Thank you. I seriously can't believe that a biologist would say that you shouldn't wear a mask unless you're sick.

Masks have been shown to have efficacy rates as high as 30%. That's often better than the flu shot does. And should we not get flu shots?

Honestly, if they only work for single digit percentage reduction, I'd recommend them. Because why not reduce the spread anyway you can?"
worldnews,ffwcpj4,t1_ffvq43i,1580295596.0,"Wow. This comment blows me away. 

Assuming you *are* a biologist, how have you not learned anything about the medical efficacy of masks?

They're not 100% effective, of course; not anywhere close to that. But they often have a higher efficacy rate than the flu shot. Are you suggesting not to get the flu shot? (my guess is no)

Some protection is better than no protection."

nfl,fft3000,t1_ffspfyz,1580204334.0,"Well, location plays into it a lot.

Let's say you live in Green Bay. You go to the game every Sunday. Now the Packers and the Giants trade rosters. You're not about to go to New Jersey every Sunday. That's crazy. 

But you like football, so you might as well support the new guys.

Then you have displaced fans like me. Love the Colts, always have. Manning left, and I cheered for the Broncos in addition to the Colts. Really torn about the Colts/Broncos games.

So yeah, if I liked the players, I would cheer for the new team. Would still like my team, though, as I don't really hate many players."
nfl,fft2t5s,t1_ffs9c2v,1580204035.0,"Be loyal to whatever you want until you don't want to be. It's that simple. 

You really like how the Patriots do things? Be a Pats fan. Disinterested now that Gronk left? Stop being a Pats fan. Like how Daniel Jones is the soul of 3li joined into a new vessel so as to carry out the will the old vessel no longer could? Be a Giants fan. Find out everyone in the head office is a pedophile? Stop being a fan. That's your thing? Be a super fan. Like the Browns? Buy a gun.

It's all very simple."
Games,ffs7jr2,t1_ffrotvk,1580175077.0,"I know someone who works on the Stadia team. We game together and stuff, usually. 

Since Stadia's release, I haven't seen him because he's working so much. 

Not sure what's going on there, but I don't imagine it's taken him 3 months to get his resume together. More likely, he's bailing water out of the sinking ship.

So they're probably doing *something*,  though, I don't know what."

worldnews,ffs5udl,t1_ffrqgxa,1580173881.0,"Possibly, yes. It's been confirmed that the police have been dressing up as protestors and committing violent actions. 

Does that mean the protestors haven't damaged anything? No, but you can't be certain who has done what at this point. 

The protestors are largely non-violent, and the police have proven themselves to be violent.

Knowing this, why would you trust the reports saying protestors set those fires?"

worldnews,ffrdeg0,t1_ffr98w4,1580155797.0,"Again, two sides of the same coin. You can say they're complete opposites, but they're not. It's like love and hate. They're the same emotion, really, just at opposite ends of that spectrum.

While Trump and Bernie are as different as can be when it comes to actual policies, they're in the same political spectrum: outsider candidates that don't conform to the mainstream.

And it's that appeal that sent some Bernie voters to Trump."
worldnews,ffr2ycg,t1_ffqerpf,1580149312.0,So the police have been inciting violence by pretending to be protestors. I would not be surprised at all to find out this is another false flag by them.
worldnews,ffr2k02,t1_ffq6mrc,1580149063.0,"It's because they're idealistic children.

They're presented with a problem, and they don't really know how to solve it. So for example, climate change. There's too much carbon entering the atmosphere. Their solution, ""stop producing carbon!!""

Stop flying on planes, stop using gas and oil, stop using coal, only use solar, blah blah blah. (She's right about getting off coal, obviously. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.)

And these things sound great. But they don't understand how the world works or the limitations of technology. They just understand their idealism and their fears.

And nuclear has been made into the boogeyman for decades.

We were so close with Obama. He was pretty pro-nuke until Fukushima happened. A 40-year-old nuclear plant that failed due to not following protocols. And even then, it wasn't that bad, and it actually almost pulled through one of the most devastating natural disasters that it wasn't built for.

But all anybody saw was that nuclear isn't safe."

worldnews,ffr12xq,t1_ffqry4q,1580148131.0,"You do know that most people are really uninformed when voting, right? That's why I said what I did.

Also, Trump and Bernie weren't complete opposites. They're two sides of the same coin. Both of them were essentially protest candidates. As in, ""we don't like how things are going, so let's try something different.""

So if it had been Trump vs. Bernie, Bernie probably would have won. But in the absence of Bernie, a lot of people went to Trump because he was the next best option.

I know it's hard to understand, but ~6 million voters did that."

Aside from having a big mouth that says whatever it wants (often contradicting himself), Trump was relatively untested. It's an easy choice if you only had those two pieces of information.

We definitely have a problem with our political process where we're only nominating diametrically opposed candidates."
