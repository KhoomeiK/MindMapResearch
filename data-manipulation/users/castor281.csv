Not every comment has to be 100% on topic. Sometimes, in comments, things are said in jest that have nothing to do with the topic being discussed. Even in everyday conversations there are tangents that are of topic yet still explored. Is this your first day on the internet or do you just feel like arguing right now? I get it, sometimes I just feel like arguing with people on Reddit, nothing wrong with that.

And I'll remind you, we aren't just talking about kidnapping. We are talking about any number of terrible things that could have happened.

Let me make my point very clear. What she did was extremely fucking stupid. Regardless of where she left from. Had she left work or home or a friends house or the supermarket or Disneyland or where-the-fuck-ever, she left to meet a complete stranger. Luckily for her there were no negative consequences from here actions. The key word there is 'luckily' If that had been my daughter, whether she was 16 or 26 I would have got on her ass for doing that. 

You keep defending the actions of a person that left to meet a complete stranger. Fuck all the talk about her job and where she worked at and all that. That doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if it was a man or a woman. It doesn't matter if she was 15 or 25. She left, alone, to go meet a person that she had only ever talked to on the phone, to give them money.

That .0068 percent of **all missing children**, including runaways, translates to 25% of *kidnapped* children. The vast majority of missing children are runaways, but of the actual kidnapped children 25% are by strangers.

The source you are providing doesn't distinguish between runaways, stranger abductions, family abductions, or acquaintance abductions and doesn't give any numbers for comparison.  The **four** sources I provide do make that distinction.  

You're wrong on this point, just move on."
facepalm,fep84y5,t1_fep4pwg,1579314280.0,"I understand that and that was my overall point even though I made that point last.

As to your second point, I completely understand that. But it doesn't make it any less dangerous. Also, that would also depend on the company you're working for. At my company I'm still on their time during my lunch break. They are liable for me even if I leave the property. I don't know if that was the case here, but it is in my case. Besides that, there's no indication that she was on her lunch break.

I was looking at it from two different perspective and perhaps I could have worded it better. Number 1, she violate company policy. They have every right to fire her. 

The second point wasn't that it was the banks responsibility to protect her, just that it was a really dangerous thing to do. That's the only reason I mentioned the point about teaching our children the way we do and the other examples. Yes she was doing a good thing, and yes it worked out, but it could have been an entirely different headline. 

I won't meet somebody to sell shit on Craigslist of Facebook without bringing a friend and I'm a grown ass man. I'm not paranoid, but neither am I willing to put myself in a position where I could be in danger. She did a good deed and I'm glad that there are people in the world with a good heart, but that absolutely does not negate the fact that she put herself in a position of vulnerability."
facepalm,fep6lcj,t1_fep3sy9,1579313289.0,"Yeah that second sentence is just completely fucking false. 

Based on [this source](https://www.parents.com/kids/safety/stranger-safety/child-abduction-facts/):

>Based on the identity of the perpetrator, there are **three distinct types of kidnapping**: kidnapping by a relative of the victim or ""family kidnapping"" (49 percent), kidnapping by an acquaintance of the victim or ""acquaintance kidnapping"" (27 percent), and kidnapping by a stranger to the victim or ""stranger kidnapping"" (24 percent). 

Of all reported missing children according to [this source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wisconsin-missinggirl-data/kidnapped-children-make-headlines-but-abduction-is-rare-in-u-s-idUSKCN1P52BJ), less than 1% are abducted by strangers. However in 95% of those cases the child ran away. So that means that 1 in 5 actual kidnappings are committed by strangers.

[This source](http://www.missingkids.com/footer/media/keyfacts) says the same thing.

And while it is 9 years old, [this FBI source](https://leb.fbi.gov/spotlights/crimes-against-children-spotlight-child-abductions-known-relationships-are-the-greater-danger) says the same thing.

ABoringDystopia,fep4igk,t3_eq8kcc,1579311954.0,"It's not like we haven't been experiencing shit like this for the entire existence of the U.S. 

Sure, people aren't getting disappeared off the streets like in some countries, but the rich have been in control of this country since the beginning and have always been above the law. 

From the U.S. Army running people off their land so the railroad barons can lay track, to the Army and police breaking up unions for the corporations. The abolishing of the gold standard, The depression and recession after recession only affecting the lower and middle class, the perpetual wars and expansion of government powers. Trillion dollar bank bailouts while everybody but the rich suffered. Illegal wars in the middle east. The list goes on and on. 

Read the book A Peoples History of the United States by Howard Zinn if you want an exhaustive compilation of all the shit like this that's wrong. I highly recommend reading Manufacturing Consent by Noam Chomsky as well as The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein. I also highly recommend reading all three of them at the same time. 

A People's History starts in the 1700's but when it gets to the 20th century you can follow chapter by chapter with The Shock Doctrine and Manufacturing Consent through the war's and the coups we have helped to facilitate. Each on their own are facinating reads, but if you read those chapters that coincide in each book together, it paints a broad picture of the finances, the media campaigns, and the covert government operations. Instead of getting one piece of the story you get to read all of it together."

And no, not when the company is liable for her actions. If something would have happened to her the family would have sued the shit out of the bank and won. If she did it on her own time after work then so be it, she accepts the risk. 
If her actions could potentially cost you personally millions of dollars you would want her to do it either. Just because it's a corporation doesn't make it any different. It sets a bad precedent as well.

If your 16 year old daughter told you she was leaving to go meet a stranger that she talked to on the internet because they REALLY, REALLY needed $20 just this one time and she really wanted to do a good thing, you absolutely would not yet her go. 

Good deed or not this is extremely dangerous behavior. Some of you people are so deluded that, just because a corporation was involved, you're willing to encourage people to meet up with strangers just because they have a sad story.

Besides all that I'm sure it was against numerous company policies. Not to mention it was a huge liability for the company. If something would have happened to her they would be 100% liable so they were 100% right to firing her."

Eragon,fenggk2,t3_eq3wue,1579284158.0,"I just can't ever grasp the timeline while traveling. Both the timeline and the map seem quite inaccurate in some spots.

When they get past Utgard, leaving Palancar Valley they fill their water skins from the Anora River and the book says Yazuac “Due east and four days away, if all goes well."" but on the map is shows south and slightly east.

Then it takes 12-13 days to get from Yazuac to Daret. On the map they are about the same distance. The book says ""Nearly a fortnight ago we passed through Yazuac and found it pillaged.""

Then it only takes about 8 days to get from Daret to the Toark river at the opening of the pass in The Spine, which on the map looks about 8-9 times longer. One day after leaving Daret the book says, Eragon: “Can we reach the pass within a week?” Brom: “Easily. If we angle away from the Ninor and to our right, we might be able to see the mountains by tomorrow.”

Then it takes 3 days to get through the pass and another 2 days to Teirm.

It's at least 3 weeks from Teirm to Lake Leona at the mouth of the Toark. Eragon had a broke wrist so they traveled slowly. The book is vague here. They were traveling for one day when Eragon broke his wrist, he slept for 2 days after the fight with the Urgals, after that all the book says is that ""the days slowly blended into weeks."" So at the very minimum that's 17 days so I went for the middle of 2 and 3 weeks plus the other 3 days and put it at 21 days.

From there it's about 6 days to Dras-Leona and then only one night to get from Dras-Leona to where Brom dies.

When Eragon and Murtagh leave Brom's grave it says that Gil'ead is ""almost as far north as Carvahall"" which on the map it clearly isn't. It also says that the path to Gil'ead forced them toward Uru'baen but the map shows it plenty to the east. It takes 11 days to get from Brom's grave to north of Uru'baen and ""almost a month"" to get from Brom's grave to Gil'ead. Also, Eragon had broken ribs on this leg of the journey so the traveling was slow.

Every other map I've seen like this has Eragon and Murtagh crossing the Ramr River north of Bullridge, but the book says they had to skirt bullridge and it aslo states at one point ""the Ramr was to their left but also five miles to their right.""

The book says they covered almost 60 leagues in 5 days from Gil'ead to the foothills of the Boers. Ajihad says they covered 130 leagues in 8 days from Gil'ead to Farthen Dur. So they traveled 60 leagues in five days riding hard and then another 70 leagues in just three days."

Europe and Japans infrastructure were devastated. Germany and Italy were pretty much leveled. Japan was devastated even before the bombs. China had been fighting Japan since 1937, before the war had started and Japan occupied a large portion of China by the time the US and USSR began giving aid. China lost upward of 20,000,000 people including civilians, the USSR lost about 40,000,000, Germany lost 7, Poland 6.

Some believe that Japan was ready to surrender under certain conditions. Namely keeping the emperor in place. 

Some believe the bombs caused the surrender. 

Some believe it was the soviet ground invasion that was just beginning when the second bomb was dropped.

Some believe it was the fear of a U.S. or allied ground invasion.

Some believe it is a combination of any number of the above factors.

It's a debate that has been raging for 70 years and it will never be universally agreed on.

I personally believe that, because of the possibility of a future war between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R,  the bombs would have been dropped regardless of whether Japan was ready to surrender or not. They were not meant to show Japan the *might* that the U.S. had created, they were meant to show the entire world in general and the U.S.S.R. specifically. 

After the first bomb, Japan appealed to Stalin for help in negotiating terms of surrender. Instead the U.S.S.R. declared war on August 8th and began their invasion on August 9th, just hours before the second bomb dropped. So a soviet invasion was gonna take place even after the first bomb.

The Soviets had already amassed troops on the border of Japanese help Manchuria in the north before the first bomb and the U.S. was ready to launch troops from the south. Japan had already lost at that point, but the question was how many more would die before a surrender had been secured. I don't think there is any dissension whatsoever among historians that many more people would have died in a ground invasion. 

I still believe though that the bombs would have been dropped regardless as a show of power."
