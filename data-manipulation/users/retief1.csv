baldursgate,fglv7uk,t1_fglunx7,1580911734.0,"Yeah, I rather like 5e.  As another example, pretty much everyone gets something vaguely interesting at every level.  There's no equivalent to the ""well, you level up, so you get a couple hp and your thaco goes down by 1"" levels that fighter types get regularly in bg1/2.  Instead, you pretty much always get either a special ability, a chance to either increase a stat or take a feat, or (for spellcasters) a new spell level.

The one arguable downside is that fighter and rogue types have a lot more options in combat, and controlling 6 characters that all need a fair amount of micromanagement might slow things down a bit compared to bg2's ""well, you can mostly just buff your fighter types up a bit and let them do their thing""."

However, a lot of the details are very different in the new edition.  As an example, everyone gains levels at the same rate, and when you level up, you can pick which class to put that level into.  So instead of deciding that you will be a fighter/mage at level one and progressing in both simultaneously, you can start as a level 1 fighter, and when you hit level 2, you can decide to put your second level into wizard.  When you hit level 3, you can put that level into any of fighter, wizard, or some third class."

summonerschool,fger9yk,t3_ey02fw,1580707277.0,"Other people have mentioned the gameplay reasons why the standard lane setup is still standard in organized play.  The other side is that once the standard lane setup got established, switching it up in solo queue is a massive pain in the ass.  Pretty much everyone is ok with playing standard (if only because the people that don't like the standard meta don't play anymore), so you'll never piss people off by playing standard lanes.  On the other hand, someone who was looking for a 1v1 in mid lane might be annoyed if they have to twiddle their thumbs for 15 minutes in a 1v2 bot lane.

Also, everyone knows how to play standard lanes.  If you lane swap, you end up putting your teammates in a very uncomfortable position.  A mid laner that is completely comfortable in a 1v1 mid may well have no clue how to play in a 1v2 bot.  And a duo lane that is completely comfortable in a 2v2 bot may have no clue how to punish people in a 2v1.  Sure, the same applies to the other team, but you still end up adding a massive amount of randomness to the game.

The result is that even when lane swaps (specifically, moving the duo lane to top) were meta in pro play, they were still almost unheard of in solo queue.  In fact, one of the reasons that lane swaps ended up getting nerfed out of existence was that they made pro games look very different from solo queue games."

Gandalf is the only real exception, and he spends a lot of time wandering off specifically because he probably could use magic to solve a lot of issues that the other main characters encounter.

I mean, yeah, if your main character has a lot of magic and they can use that magic in a practical manner, then they should probably use their magic when it makes sense.

There are two ways around this.  The first is to tell the reader about the stun guns ahead of time.  The second is to not use stun guns.  The first path leads to well defined magic systems.  The second leads to protagonists that simply don't solve their problems using magic.  Maybe they don't have access to magic, maybe using magic would cause more problems than it would solve, etc.

haskell,ffqh7ts,t1_ffpuax1,1580134510.0,"And clojure specifically only implements rseq for vectors and sorted maps, because you can't reverse a list in a manner that is both lazy and efficient.  Basically, part of the contract of seqs is that making one is constant time (because they are lazy) and iterating through one is linear time.  In clojure, this sort of limitation is fine, because the underlying interface is limited enough that you would rarely want to violate this contract anyways.

Sure, haskell could have a library with a similar design.  Nothing about higher kinded types forces you to make everything as general as possible.  However, if you are comparing haskell to another language and you mostly aren't using hkts to do anything that you couldn't do with f# interfaces, then maybe haskell isn't quite as compelling as you thought."

If `map` is of type `(x -> y) -> f x -> Seq y`, then you will mostly only implement it on basic datastructures.  Sure, you can work with one of several data structures, but you won't be dealing with maybes or promises.  Doing something like this in haskell would probably still require higher kinded types, but plenty of other languages can implement this level of polymorphism without higher kinded types.  Frankly, java interfaces are all you really need.

On the other hand, if `map` is of type `(x -> y) -> f x -> f y`, then it makes sense to implement it on a lot of other data types as well.  And being able to work generally with anything that implements this `map` pretty much requires higher kinded types.

Edit: also, I'm mostly looking at this from the perspective of ""do I want to use haskell or do I want to use f#/typescript/etc"".  One of the most notable advantages of haskell's type system over the other languages I mentioned is higher kinded types.

If you use the closely related ParAff monad, the applicative instance runs everything in parallel and the alternative instance runs both and uses the value from whichever callback returns first.  Keeping track of whether you are currently using Aff or ParAff is pretty important."
haskell,ffoh168,t1_ffnmutt,1580077563.0,"The actual type is `a -> b -> a`.  Under the hood, it can just pass around the appropriate pointers or whatever without ever having to care about what the pointer is pointing to, so it truly doesn't care what you pass it.  If you are doing something more with your arguments and you do care about the types, then it will infer a more precise type signature.

As an example, say you write `fn a b = a + b`, Haskell will infer a type of `Num a => a -> a -> a`.  Under the hood, the function will actually take three arguments -- a dictionary that contains a plus function that is specialized for a given type and two arguments of that type.  As a result, `fn` still works for any argument type (assuming that the compiler can find the appropriate typeclass instance) without needing multiple versions of `fn` that are specialized for different types."

haskell,ffo8hgg,t1_ffo26qr,1580075172.0,"Yup, fair enough.  My point isn't really ""higher kinded types make haskell worse"", since as you said, you don't need to take advantage of them.

Instead, it is more ""higher kinded types aren't as much of an advantage as you might think"".  Like, if I'm comparing haskell to other good statically typed languages (think f# level), one of the more obvious pros for haskell is higher kinded types.  I'm just not sure how much weight I should give that particular advantage.  If using them heavily results in hard to understand code, then they might not add as much value as X advantage of Y other language."
haskell,ffnxhvt,t1_ffntr4k,1580072019.0,"Yup, and that mostly only happens in haskell (and equivalents).  If I see `map f something` in any other language, I'm fairly sure that it is doing something with some sort of collection.  In some cases, I might know exactly which collection I'm working with, as well (if the call is actually `List.map`, for example).  If I'm using `fmap` in haskell, I could be working with a list, or I could be translating the value returned by an async request.  On the plus side, this means that you can use `fmap` in a wide variety of situations.  On the minus side, seeing `fmap` doesn't actually tell you very much about what the code is actually doing under the hood.  If I want to know whether this is working with lists or promises, I have to look at the context to figure out what types I'm dealing with."

Caitlynmains,ffj6tcj,t3_etxq4y,1579991844.0,"Short answer: yes.  The only hard and fast rule is that you want to get 3-4 crit items before anything else.  Beyond that, there aren't too many terrible options, so feel free to experiment.

Some guidelines:

You want ad early, so start with stormrazor or ie.

Ie is pretty important in general, so it definitely should be one of your first 2-3 items even if you rush stormrazor.

Hurricane is a bit of a waste on cait."
ezrealmains,ffj6h43,t3_etwmze,1579991607.0,"Going sheen or pickaxe on first back lets you do something in lane.  Sheen's better, but you can make pickaxe work if you are careful with your mana.  After that, you want tear asap for stacks.  From here, manamune is a very efficient ad item, so get it next.  You can think of sheen + manamune as a similar powerspike to ie + stormrazor on a crit adc.

After this, complete your sheen into either trinity or ibg.  Trinity is the damage option, ibg is the defense/utility option.  I prefer trinity, but other people definitely make ibg work.  Note: only build one of these.  Building both is a waste of money, since the sheen proc doesn't fully stack.

By this time, you should probably have gotten boots.  I generally go for cdr boots, but sorc shoes are good if you go hybrid ez (see below).  As far as when to build them is concerned, if you have a useful non-boot buy, go for it.  If you've bought every useful item you can afford and you still have gold left over, grab/upgrade boots.  And if you've finished two items and haven't finished your boots yet, then finish them before you start your third.

After this, you have some flexibility.  Bork is generally the best raw damage item at this point (particularly if you went triforce), and so that's what I usually go.  However, if you really need the defense, you can get a defensive item like ga, mercurial, maw, bg, or edge of night next.  Executioners can be good against the right team as well, though I probably wouldn't upgrade it to mortal reminder immediately.  Finally, if your team is all ad, going for hybrid ez and grabbing either ludens or gunblade (or, say, zhonyas or banshees if you need defense).

For your next item, you basically have the same options as before.  If you got bork, maybe consider a defensive item next -- edge of night is my usual choice.  If you got a defensive item earlier, bork would probably be a good idea here.  If you went hybrid, grab the other of ludens or gunblade (or a defensive ap item).

Finally, a last whisper upgrade tends to be good on ez by the 6 item mark.  Even if the other team isn't really building armor, people have enough base armor late game that ldr/mortal reminder will be worthwhile.  In practice, it's the best damage item you have left.  The only exception to this is hybrid ez, since you are focusing more on magic damage.  With that build, you want another ap item.  Same deal as before, really -- luden's if you don't have it, gunblade if you don't have it, or zhonyas/banshees if you need defense.  If you already have ludens and gunblade and you don't want a defensive item, grabbing a deathcap never hurt anyone.

TL;DR: When in doubt, go sheen or pickaxe -> tear -> manamune -> trinity -> bork -> edge of night -> last whisper upgrade"
typescript,ffi9gui,t1_ffi7j1m,1579968505.0,"If you are curious, the library code that the example haskell code is relying on is basically this:

    type Result <e, v> = {success: true, value: v} | 
      {success: false, error: e}

    function bind<e, v1, v2>(val: Result<e, v1>, f: (v: v1) => Result<e, v2>): Result<e, v2> {

Like, the second book in publication order is some number of years earlier than the first book, takes place on the other side of an ocean, and shares precisely one major character.  Then this book is 4th and takes place in the same spot as the second book but ~20? years earlier and follows the parent of one of the main characters from the second book.  Overall, it is very easy to read them as standalone books."
typescript,ffi7j1m,t1_ffi5afu,1579967134.0,"The result monad thing is that if you think a computation can fail, you can essentially return this type:

    type Result<e, v> = { readonly success: true, readonly value: v } | {readonly success: false, readonly error: e}

So if you have a function that can either successfully return a string or fail with an AxiosError, you can check whether the function succeeded and then either handle the error or use the result.  So far, simple enough.

The ""monad"" part is just that haskell provides syntactic sugar and a ton of utility functions for working with things like this.  So in haskell, you can write

    do
      v1 <- computationThatCanFail1 arg1 arg2
      v2 <- computationThatCanFail2 arg3 arg4
      return (v1 + v2)

If both computations succeed, haskell will pull the values out of each one, add them together, and essentially return `{success: true, value: vSum}`.  If either fails, haskell will immediately stop and return `{success: false, error: firstError}`.  Either way, you don't have to worry about manually checking whether the computations succeeded -- the monadic machinery automatically handles that for you.

The advantage of this sort of setup is that it is fully type safe.  You can tell at a glance whether a function is capable of failing, and if it does, you'll know what sort of errors you can get back.  If you ever fail to check for an error, the compiler will yell at you.

In typescript, the downside of this style is that you don't get all of the cool toys that haskell style languages give you for working with these things efficiently.  It isn't impossible to us them, but you'll probably end up writing a bunch of utility functions for these things, and the end result still won't look as nice as the haskell version does."
