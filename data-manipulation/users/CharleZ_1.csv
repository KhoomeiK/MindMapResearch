JuJutsuKaisen,ffg1gr3,t3_etcrfb,1579896399.0,This fight was intense
JuJutsuKaisen,fffp6eh,t1_fffok57,1579888780.0,"Yeah I know, not arguing or anything. I know Demon Slayer isn’t all cutesy characters and all, there’s brutality and bloodshed. Also, I’m still sad over Rengoku ;-;"
JuJutsuKaisen,fffng09,t1_fffk3ig,1579887727.0,"Well there are some pretty bloody scenes in JJK too, like when Mahito warps all those humans, and when Yuji gets half his head cut-off when confronting Ryomen. Also, that papa Fushiguro fight was pretty gnarly."
Deusex,ffecddq,t3_ekzsxi,1579842959.0,I asked for this
BlackClover,ffec9mh,t1_ffebnww,1579842865.0,"Well, at least we got some killer OSTs and OPs/EDs from both series"
Boruto,ffec35x,t3_esxb8u,1579842697.0,"Pierrot should just take a break from the anime rn, wait until the manga gets to a decently long length, and go back to animating it, full story and canon, no filler. In the meanwhile, they can get to making Black Clover their big series and maybe  just MAYBE get on to animating that final Bleach arc. But that’s just wishful thinking ;-;"
