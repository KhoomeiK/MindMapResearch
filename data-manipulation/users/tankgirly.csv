interestingasfuck,fgpj91x,t1_fgp3mln,1581005898.0,"Yeah, you're totally not wrong. I just feel like the two are so different. Even when I have a good trip on shrooms, it still feels uncomfortable and overwhelming, and I have such an amaaaaazing time every time I do acid. I guess I'm a little too gungho about everyone experiencing it. No one should do anything they don't feel ready for, especially folks who struggle with anxiety or have a family history of mental illness for sure. Good point."

mildlyinteresting,fgp24zp,t1_fgoj2c9,1580994736.0,I used to have a water container that said that from think geek back in the day.
interestingasfuck,fgotoax,t1_fgot3m0,1580986083.0,"I actually find shrooms sort of unpleasant- I feel out of control, almost like I'm drowning in the high? But with acid I feel like can control everything. I feel like queen of the universe. I highly recommend acid. Shrooms make me feel yucky and kinda scared even though I've had some crazy, profound feeling trips."
RedditLaqueristas,fgos8dj,t1_fgoaqgb,1580984066.0,"No, it's like a specific product. I got the sticky base coat from maniology, but I've read that foil glue also works well. It dries sticky, so when you put your dried, colored in stamp on there it transfers easily. Without it, reverse stamping is a frustrating, near impossible task for me."
laquerENTstas,fgnlp3j,t1_fetqjhf,1580947544.0,I know it's a little late- I just found this sub! So excited! That's from a stamping plate from maniology. I think it's called Rebel Yell? It's cute. Has a bunch of music stuff on it like a cassette tape and a record.

RedditLaqueristas,fgnketp,t1_fgmtk9o,1580946707.0,Sticky base coat was the key to successful reverse stamping for me. Game changer.
RedditLaqueristas,fgio95n,t1_fghbnud,1580827077.0,I LOVE these test swatches! This is immensely helpful. I never thought to do it that way!
AmItheAsshole,fg5a36q,t1_fg4ucy9,1580522108.0,"Yeah, the rest of the story is too much bullshit for me to process right now. All I can focus on is them waking up a sleeping baby and new mum. I would have lost my shit tbh."

RedditLaqueristas,ffukxjf,t1_ffuj25t,1580244131.0,Thank you! Sticky base coat was the game changer for me. I put it on my nails but it would probably work the other way too. I hope it works well for you!

RedditLaqueristas,fftv26p,t3_ev7nvo,1580229104.0,"I used maniology stamping polish in Straight Up Black, Bam! White, Love Potion, and the sticky base coat, Pop-arazzi  Speedboat and Buttercream, Revlon matte top coat, and stamping plates m071, m072, and mxm016. Heavily inspired by a look by hannys_manis in Instagram."

NailArt,ffcdjav,t1_ff4mabj,1579797128.0,"Oh, also, get some sticky base coat or nail foil glue! It helps with everything nail art related. Stamping, reverse stamping, chrome and holo powders, foil... For me it's the difference between a frustrating experience and a successful one."

NailArt,ffcbofn,t1_ff4mabj,1579795973.0,I really like maniology. They have an ad on Instagram where you can get a nail stamping kit for the price of shipping (7.99). It's the first time I've ever been successful with stamping.
BadMUAs,ff9bog6,t1_ff930hs,1579709296.0,"I wash and exfoliate my face way more than the rest of my body, so fake tan would probably get super splotchy and then just disappear within a day or so."

AmItheAsshole,ff1ju0s,t1_fews7eb,1579480334.0,"Yeah, I brought my newborn to a couple movies while he was really tiny. We had baby earmuffs, we went during the day, and sat in the very back just in case he started acting like he was about to fuss. He slept through all of it. I did have to step out for a few minutes once, but he never actually cried in the theater. Once they get past like 3 months though, there's just no way. They're squirmy little noise makers for the next 4+ years."
