Republican,few3tal,t1_fevy8fj,1579404950.0,I mean... I know people who side as Republicans who literally think the earth is flat. Both sides have crazy people that most of the country disagree with. Both sides have idiots and very smart people who are trying to do the best for the country. It’s not as simple as people like you make it seem. That’s exactly that the main stream media wants you to think like. That us vs them mentality is what the MM wants us to do so they can keep us as fanatic viewers. Fight that shit. Most Dems/Rep aren’t the extremist they want you to think they are. We’re all Americans.
Republican,fevxwj2,t1_fevvxmr,1579402917.0,Lol. Yea... Things aren’t that bad. Calm down. I haven’t seen anything so bad that I see the need to start killing some of my neighbors. This the exact kind of mentality that’s tearing this country apart from both sides.
Republican,fev932w,t1_feuexge,1579394576.0,Citizens United proves that there’s plenty of republicans who care more about $ and staying in power more then doing what’s right for the country. There’s shitty self serving politicians on both sides. Our side isn’t so innocent you know.
Republican,fev8gag,t1_fesr6so,1579394400.0,Wake up dude. There’s plenty of people who side with Republicans that have some pretty awful views as well. I’ve totally seen people on this sub call for a civil war so they can help kill a whole segment of our society.
AskReddit,fev4x85,t3_eqies2,1579393134.0,BOTH of my parents had a dream that my sister would die. The next day she was hit by a drunk driver while walking next to the street. She died that day at the age of 4. I was 2 at the time. I’m not a religious person but how do you explain that shit?
Republican,ferldtx,t1_feritlv,1579355413.0,"Yea I’m actually in Chicago, I grew up in Florida, but luckily no one here really post political stuff on social media except my former boss who’s a republican so I guess I lucked out!"
Republican,ferkt9p,t1_ferilq7,1579355192.0,"Thanks for the link! I wonder if this is the kind of thing that goes back and forth depending on who’s in the white house. Like the party not in power tends to be more motivated to do all that extra work on social media. 

The article mentions social media being used to organize and find rallies for example. We had a ton of tea party rallies during Obama’s first term that I’m sure social media played a part in. It would be interesting to start comparing studies like this throughout the past decade."
tifu,ferhn24,t3_eq59kp,1579353990.0,Lol something very similar happened to me after 16-17 years. I should have known something was up when my dick always sets off those airport body scanners.
Republican,ferf6zg,t1_fepe656,1579353197.0,"The social media thing is probably gonna vary from person to person.  I’m from Florida and so are many of my friends. There’s definitely a right lean to my news feed including a flat earther!! I always thought they were a fake internet thing but they’re real! Turns out that the whole flat earth thing is based on religion, at least for this person, but that’s a whole different topic. If anything I feel like conservatives have the upper hand on getting the message across on social media these days. The Obama campaign was the first to use it successfully in 2008, but they lost that lead in my opinion"
aww,fdof82s,t1_fdocl3l,1578603975.0,"Your right that it’s an externally small amount of energy, but if everyone has that same mentality it adds up when you consider there are hundreds of millions in this country alone, the US, and billions across the world. Like I told someone else, no one cry’s over losing a few pennies, but if you take a penny from everyone just one time you’d have enough to live off for the rest of your life. Or like all the people that are visiting our national parks. One person isn’t going have a large impact on the environment, but increase that to millions of visitors and suddenly it’s a noticeable issue. 

Honestly I don’t think it’s that bad yet, but I could see a distant future, maybe 100+, where humans will need to be more aware of their water use and start doing things like limiting shower time. Especially if we never decide to take things like our water and energy usage a little more seriously. Hopefully we’ll have mastered desalination and renewable energy by then. 

I won’t be around by then and I don’t plan on having kids so whatever I guess."
aww,fdo6pp7,t1_fdo3y25,1578599847.0,"Can’t believe so many people don’t get that waste is waste. 

I’m not saying we shouldn’t flush the toilet, wash ourselves, drink water, or water our house plants. What I’m saying is we should be cautious not to waste water when it’s not necessary. No, it’s not a huge amount of water, but if everyone thinks this way about the tiny amount of water or energy they use it all adds up to a much larger amount. We all need to make changes in our lives if we’re serious at all about saving our resources. Better start with smaller changes now then with much larger harsher changes as the planet gets worse and we’re forced to deal with it in a more dramatic way.

It like a penny in the US. Here no one is gonna cry if they lose a few pennies. But if you were to collect a one penny from everyone you’d be set for the rest of your life. Small amounts of waste add up. Why is this so hard to comprehend?"
aww,fdo51ia,t1_fdnytr9,1578599023.0,"Let’s say I live somewhere that treats and recycles 100% of my water. There’s still energy being used to clean that water going down the drain. If we all use a little less, that’s a little less energy being used. I’m astonished at how hard it is to get the point across that waste is waste. Nothing is free! There’s always some kind of cost."
aww,fdnykdp,t1_fdnvoj9,1578595466.0,"Lol Did I say we had to go to that much of an extreme? I’m taking about if we all took small steps like not letting the water run when we don’t need to, or flushing a tiny piece of paper down the toilet. You know, obvious waste. There’s a ton of small shit like that in all of our lives. How does that not compute with you?! We all need to drink water. Now your just sounding like a retarded teenager with a shitty overreacting argument."
aww,fdnxwtt,t1_fdnizcn,1578595089.0,"Wells do run dry. You’ll be paying to have it dug deeper eventually, and you could be dealing with a smell in your water or extra equipment to deal with it. Hate showering at my mother in laws bc of the smell. Nothing is free amigo."
aww,fdnxleg,t1_fdnha3f,1578594902.0,"Right, bc ocean water is what runs from our faucet, it’s also what we drink, and give to our crops. Wtf!? What kind of argument is that?! Haha. 

At least you spelled bird right."
aww,fdnx6tw,t1_fdnggss,1578594665.0,A reasonable shower for a person uses WAY less water then a bath would. Not true at all for this tiny bird and the small bowl that could be its bath.
aww,fdnwpdc,t1_fdngnxm,1578594383.0,My shower uses less water then me taking a bath. Not true for this bird. I know it doesn’t seem like much. But if everyone thinks this way about the tiny amount of water or energy they use it all adds up to a much larger amount. We all need to make changes in our lives if we’re serious at all about saving our resources. Better start with smaller changes now then with much larger harsher changes as the planet gets worse and we’re forced to deal with it in a more dramatic way.
aww,fdnvsj0,t1_fdnj8wa,1578593853.0,Take my upvote. Hate this trend so much. This fucking sucks dick
aww,fdnvk77,t1_fdnpvwy,1578593717.0,"It’s this kind of mentality that’s gonna end up fucking us all. Yea it’s only just a little, but if everyone thinks that way about their water and energy usage it adds up to a much much larger amount. Waste is waste, and if it’s as easy as stopping the drain and not letting water run down the drain then why not?"
Republican,fdgp6mz,t1_fdey29d,1578404611.0,Totally division. Fucking hate how childish politics has become in this country. Social media has made it 100x worse.
JehovahsWitnesses,fc389y1,t1_fbw50q9,1577383861.0,"The person that runs this sub,  the person you replied to, is really hateful. On the republican sub he was totally for a civil war so they could kill a whole class of people they don’t agree with. I would link the post here but it was removed, you know bc it’s  spreading hate and calling for people’s death based on nothing but religion. Kinda like ISIS, but with a Christian twist.  I asked in exJW if this was the norm in the community bc it seems extreme and no one agreed with this joker. This sub is run by someone really off the rails. 

I just keep checking this dudes posts to see what other hateful shit he posts and found myself here."
