personalfinance,fellvsh,t1_feldazt,1579225290.0,"Yeah the issue is that rents have risen to about $300 over the cost of mortgage, property tax and insurance.

I also explained in another comment why I think this market isn’t slowing down for a while."
personalfinance,fellkw6,t1_felj0nh,1579225085.0,"I still sort of stick by my statement. The Wasatch Front, main population center, has a couple unique indicators that make it more resistant to a market correction than most. 

The first issue is the geographic limitations.  Within 50km of salt lake, less that 30% of the land is developable. Markets similar to this are Los Angeles, Miami, NYC, San Francisco. By no means is SLC like those markets, but it does have a shared development constraint. 

Utah in the last decade has been experiencing a population boom, fueled largely by the net negative migration of California. The unexpected population boom has backed up into a 10 year net housing shortage, when calculated using increase on new jobs over increase of housing units. A healthy rate is considered 1.5 jobs per housing unit. The WF has been consistently above the parameter. Most likely leading to the ballooning house prices. 

The most common solution to this is to build more houses. Leading markets to over build and eventually the excess stock leads to a drop in housing prices. Especially so if fueled by default in sold houses as well. The problem arises when we look at the developable land available in and near the metro. There’s a study, I can send it to you, that looks at all metros above 500,000 people and calculates a price supply elasticity for each. The scary part comes in here, the supply elasticity is 0.75 if I remember correctly. Again, right up there with with those major “overpriced” real estate markets. 

The problem the WF has, they’re quickly running out of places to build. After 2023, I’m not entirely sure if there will be much developable land left near the main arteries and highways. 

So with a lack of area to build and an already established housing shortage leaves the WF in a rather precarious place, even given a market correction. 

The product split has tipped towards delivering 57% multifamily units and the remaining single family. Even with those deliveries the market hasn’t slowed down. 

I agree the US a whole, yes is due for a rather serious market correction. I would make the argument that Utah, like it was during the subprime mortgage crisis fueled recession, affected to a much smaller extent. I believe if all. It’ll depend on what drives the correction. 

Sorry I tried to summarize a presentation I gave at work for a home builder. I’d love to share the data and research with you if you’re interested. I can connect the dots a lot better that way too."
