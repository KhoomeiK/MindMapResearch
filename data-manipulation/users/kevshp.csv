1. Get a small washer and a piece of yarn.

2. Tie yarn (6-12 inches) to the washer. 

3. Hold the yarn and let it dangle.

4. You can make the washer swing: forward/backwards, side to side, clockwise/counterclockwise, and still. This is done by just thinking where you want the washer to go. It's important that the arm holding the yarn is supported so it doesn't affect it (ie. elbow resting on a table). 

What is happening? Thinking/focusing which direction you want the washer to go causes tiny muscle contractions in your finger tips. It's crazy."

It was for a separated AC joint in my shoulder that never healed. Surgery for it caused additional problems. If they were aware of EDS back then, they probably wouldn't have done it (the surgery shortened my clavicle so it would stop hitting the acromion process, which is part of the shoulder blade)."

But yesterday I just had a procedure on the connective tissue on my hips. I also have hypermobile fingers, toes, ribs, jaw, lower back, and whatever else I can't think of.

Problem is that the consult was through the VA and I think she wanted to play it safe. She did write a letter saying she couldn't give the diagnosis but that it's not ruled out, I met 2 of 3 criteria, and I am hypermobile."
ehlersdanlos,fg0r9uu,t1_fg0l7rv,1580413464.0,"Absolutely but in my case the geneticist says I probably have it but can't give me an official diagnosis due to the strict diagnostic criteria (I can't be the only one in this situation).

However my doctor told me there were no additional precautions after the procedure. Nothing was said about ice or anti-inflammatories (I can't take those anyways)."
ehlersdanlos,fg0fczq,t1_fg0dz35,1580406629.0,"I get that, but it's better medical evidence for hEDS than the Beighton Scale. I have plenty of hypermobile joints, just not enough of the ones they list. My sister has an official diagnosis and we both have tons of the related conditions (my mom, uncle, and cousin also likely have EDS). Seems like 1 test that can see the defect is much better and would provide clarity to all of us who can't get official diagnoses because of a substandard protocol."
