So I like to read the Economist, for example, (just the monthlies, they put out too much content) as it’s taking a financial bias, which is a little different from what we tend to see in media. 

When a topic piques my interest to the point of doing research, I search for foreign news releases and compare the different takes. So, I’m Canadian, I read CBC, then I’d check BBC, then start looking for releases from Russia, China, maybe India. The location of the news will influence where else I look. 

Be sure to include search words like “discovery”, “scam”, “socialist”, “fascist”, etc. It will bring up writings from groups of people you (perhaps) don’t know well. 

Of course I’m not suggesting you believe all these sources but just to see such radically different views should get you thinking differently about the world around you and what’s happening. 

Just be sure not to get yourself added to a watchlist."

I haven’t tried to eliminate the smell so I’m not sure how hard it is to do."

Essentially, instead of using combustion, indirect heat is used to create a vapour releasing the THC and other cannabinoids. You just inhale like usually, only it’s healthier, and easier on the throat and lungs.

Edit: I forgot. The “ash” from vaping can be used in edibles. It’s already decarboxylated by the vaping. So we get a little more out of your vape than with burning."
canadients,ffglvhz,t3_etiagw,1579909254.0,"Hi,

So I’m a novice “smoker” but this is what I did: 

I tried vape carts to start after nearly coughing a lung trying to smoke a jay. You still cough, but it’s minor. 

These come in disposable pens (heating element and cartridge together, used once) or with rechargeable pens and disposable carts. 

You’ll actually feel it fairly quickly, so take a couple of puffs, wait a few minutes then have some more. Once you’re comfortable with how you react, vape as you like. 

I’ve stopped oil cart vaping in favour of flower vaping. It’s cheaper and surprisingly, even easier on the throat / lungs than the carts. We’ve got an Arizer Solo II (I think) and it works great for the two of us. We kept a pen and a cart for travelling ease. 

Low scent for both, better for your lungs than combustion, are pros. The carts have no ash. The flower vape “ash” is already ready to be made into edibles. So choose which perk matters more to you. 

Have fun!"
istanbul,ffgem3a,t3_etggqs,1579904512.0,In Canada we do this if we expect freezing rain. It keeps the wipers from freezing to the glass. Maybe you guys are looking at some poor weather conditions?

preppers,fffynbr,t3_etevyl,1579894669.0,"So I’ve never looked at canning. 
Is it actual cans or jars?
Do you can one kind of food item (only green beans in this can) or my homemade chicken and rice soup?
How big and / or expensive is canning equipment?
I hate vinegar and pickled foods taste awful to me. Is this the same thing?"

bugout,ffewexf,t1_ffdehm2,1579868322.0,"What about one’s own embassy? I always keep scans of my IDs when I travel in case I lose something; I figure I can go to the embassy and they can look everything up more easily that way. 

Idk where I got the idea though."
bugout,ffew6ja,t3_esxt9j,1579868075.0,"Are you bugging out to a BOL? If so, it seems to me you’d want to be fast and mobile. Easy to make camp, easy to break camp. 

If you’re just bugging out, then idk. It might be worth it, but having a secure BOL would be a greater benefit. Then you could maybe have a less expensive and perhaps even more functional stove there. 

I’m no expert; I’d be interested in hearing any opposing or additional points to broaden my perspective. 

FWIW, I would also we looking at serious cold as my No 1 risk to health. I absolutely would have to bug out if any serious situation were to happen (major city) and I don’t currently have a BOL, so I’m not being snobby (!) I just don’t trust my ability to keep warm in winter outside in Canada with millions? of other Canadians desperate to keep warm."

So you can adjust it for preference or for digestive ability (if someone’s been sick for example), or just to make it stretch a little further to cover an extra mouth."
