I mean if she was bad becomes of Roman and all of a sudden becomes a good guy for juane then it just feels like she's just guy obsessed and either very easily manipulated or is so submissive that she'll just do whatever she's told. I think she could be her own bad ass bitch. Maybe even create her own syndicate and have a right hand man act as an interpreter for her while she runs the crime ring of a town or continent or something.

TalesFromThePharmacy,feyvmw9,t1_feyqsto,1579451022.0,From what I gathered it's cultural tradition run rampant. In Hispanic culture you hyphenate your last name and since these are such common names when they married it became doubled instead of squaring. If they're immagrants it's also possible it's how their original i.d. was processed so it carried over. I've been handed i.d.'s from the Dominican republic that have 4 different last names for similar reasons. I've also seen insurance process the names weird like that and we have to follow through with the name on insurance otherwise it won't be covered.
