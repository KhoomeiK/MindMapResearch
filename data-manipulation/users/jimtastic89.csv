Sounds like you were in a similar boat to me, and honestly, I just packed up and left. 

I dont know what your situation is, but a really good option (if you're a bit lost and young) , is to get out of the country you're in. You dont have to, but it's what I did. 

I went for 2 years, I worked in bars and tourism, I went and saw some sites and I met quite a few people. The great thing was,mostly everyone was travelling or in a similar situation, just going with the flow, enjoying their freedom.

You are free, not from yourself, but from everything around you. 

Finding a situation where you dont have to worry about what people think, and you can be whoever you want, you know what I mean? 

I didnt know who the fuck I was or what I should do.. didnt know what I was good at..

And you know what? I didnt find what i was good at, i didnt find an answer. But i learned about myself, and about how i i interact with people, and that is how I think I dug myself a tunnel out of the hole. 

Admittedly its more like a skylight, letting light in.. but, if you havent experienced what the world has to offer, before you think about ending it, go see what's out there, the natural wonders. Ground yourself and remind yourself that theres more than all the bad news and doom and gloom.
