fatlogic,fffk1ze,t1_fffgh92,1579885647.0,"Not gonna lie, that sounds delicious."
fatlogic,fffjza9,t1_fffipt9,1579885600.0,"Honestly, that kind of stuff totally depends on the clothing brand. I'm an XS at Target, and a S at Kohl's, for instance. There's not much of a universal standard anymore being applied at the consumer level."
fatlogic,fffaekl,t3_etbmyx,1579879607.0,"Cinnamon rolls downstairs. Am prediabetic, can't have cinnamon rolls. Wish I lived in a culture that truly had diet culture. FAs are full of shit. We don't have diet culture in the US, we have obesity culture. Obesity culture can go fuck itself."
fatlogic,ff9g3ga,t1_ff94ae2,1579712268.0,"As a long-term maintainer, I use a lot of similar methods and they work for me. I'd also like to add that willpower isn't as much of a big deal as you might think; it's more important to arrange your life so that willpower is seldom necessary."
fatlogic,ff6jlhn,t3_erw5oj,1579628588.0,"And yet, not the slightest questioning at all of the idea that a woman should be judged on the basis of her looks. So feminist, much radical."
fatlogic,ff1vgmd,t3_eqn0mo,1579487079.0,"Yeah, nope,if I ate whatever I wanted it would definitely be mostly chocolate all the time."
fatlogic,ff1uqvk,t1_fey190j,1579486629.0,"Thanks, I'll give that a shot."
fatlogic,fevqo0o,t3_eqi4rp,1579400349.0,"Strangely enough, losing weight and keeping it off is also difficult, but not impossible, and has the added side benefits of making you both look better naked and not run the risk of amputation. Think I'll keep going with that, thanks."
fatlogic,feo76kd,t3_eq1ksj,1579296024.0,"Every time I climb stairs, it feels much harder than it should. I work out regularly, am at a healthy weight, and take the stairs all the time, so I don't get why they aren't easier for me. I suppose there's another form of exercise I should be doing, but damn, I feel like an old lady."
fatlogic,felw2ts,t1_feke10k,1579232380.0,"Yep. We evolved to survive in times of food scarcity, not abundance. Food abundance throughout most of human history was a pretty rare thing. Most of the time, you were lucky to just be getting enough."
fatlogic,fek3dn2,t3_epk1xh,1579191754.0,"The idea of unrestricted eating is just plain ridiculous in the modern world of mostly sedentary jobs and hyperpalatable, easily available, high calorie foods. Unless you're one of the lucky ones to have an appetite that naturally matches your normal BMI TDEE, you have to restrict. Period. You can't always have everything you want. That's part of life."
fatlogic,fek2ahq,t1_fejhz0f,1579191087.0,Yikes.

fatlogic,fe8p1vv,t1_fe2wbjv,1578928768.0,"I don't know if this will work for you, but it's been helping me out a lot so I thought I'd suggest it. Whenever I see a food I'm tempted to eat but know I shouldn't, I write it down on my ""anti-to-do"" list. I put a checkbox next to it, and I get to check it off as ""done"" if I go the whole day without eating it. It's gotten so that just writing the item down has helped take the edge off the temptation. It's not a magic bullet but it's something that's been helping me so far. Anyway, good luck!"
fatlogic,fe4qk61,t3_en29tf,1578861905.0,It's one thing to fill out a bit and not be as skinny as you were in high school. Quite another thing to be overweight or obese.
fatlogic,fe3k7jr,t3_enn6kd,1578850030.0,"Well, I refuse to have sex with people I'm not attracted to, so problem solved."

fatlogic,fdqh27j,t3_emqdcr,1578666483.0,"I do agree that we should focus on Lizzo's music rather than her body, since she's a musician first and foremost. 

I also agree with much of the commentary I've seen that the Biggest Loser was a horrible show that was cruel to fat people. 

What a surprise, nuance is a thing that exists in the world, whether acknowledged or not."
fatlogic,fdqf53g,t1_fdppo0e,1578665070.0,"Hello, fellow unreal person!"
fatlogic,fdqew8t,t3_emmake,1578664880.0,"I didn't starve myself to a BMI of 20, I ate less and moved more. There's a pretty big gulf between that and starvation. By definition I didn't starve myself...because a BMI of 20 isn't indicative of starvation, but a healthy weight."
fatlogic,fdlqown,t3_em00tr,1578530209.0,Being able to drive is a privilege. I say this as someone who has had extreme difficulty learning to drive due to a learning disability and as someone who would probably find car ownership a financial burden anyway.
pokemon,fdejjj1,t3_eks49g,1578340374.0,So cute! Nice job.
fatlogic,fde2hw1,t1_fddbg79,1578329708.0,"I have a problem with the term ""disordered eating"" because it seems so vague. I think an awful lot of people are incredibly uninformed about weight loss and nutrition and try a lot of stupid things as a result to try to lose weight, like ""cleanses"" (really, the new crash diet) or wraps or pills or just don't think in terms of developing sustainable habits they can keep up over time but overfocus on losing x amount by x date. Is that ""disordered eating""? I don't think so, but I suspect a lot of those kinds of behaviors are what people are actually thinking of when they use that term."
fatlogic,fde203q,t3_ekrxni,1578329388.0,I'd really love to know where they pulled that stat from. I'm guessing their smelly ass.
fatlogic,fde1adq,t3_ekn7m2,1578328921.0,I really would rather it not matter whether my body was beautiful or not than be lied to that my body is  beautiful when it just isn't.
fatlogic,fde158a,t1_fde0lin,1578328827.0,I'm a long-term maintainer as well.
fatlogic,fd5ncdl,t1_fd3fc9u,1578179345.0,Agreed. I struggle with emotional eating myself but at least I'm working on it.
fatlogic,fcxjih0,t1_fcxhr1w,1578064475.0,Good for them. And it's really sad how uninformed these activists are about colonialism in reality.
fatlogic,fcxjgqy,t1_fcxgtek,1578064441.0,"I think the higher one's weight is, the more likely it is that their weight is due to them using food for psychological reasons, but I'm not sure that's true 100% of the time. I know this not data, but my brother is pretty severely obese and I don't think he has any psychological problems, I think he just likes to eat too much (he also has relatively little fatlogic, he knows he eats too much). Bad habits can be hard to break. 

On the other end of the scale, someone could have an eating disorder and be  normal weight or only a little bit overweight, so you can't totally use weight as a proxy for mental health. But yes, I'm sure the percentage of mental problems related to food does go up with the severity of obesity in general."
fatlogic,fcxfuvb,t3_eje8lm,1578061847.0,"Actually, obesity is probably more the result of racism, more specifically, colonialism, since a lot of places with populations who had no problems with obesity before developed major problems with obesity after being conquered by imperialist countries that then spread their unhealthy food culture to them. This is a lot of why Polynesian has such major problems with obesity."
fatlogic,fcxfmtl,t1_fcwg2qa,1578061678.0,"I always compare counting calories to washing your hands. Nobody questions washing your hands after going to the bathroom or after handling raw meat, and people should look at counting calories the same way. Yes, people with EDs use calorie counts to prop up an unhealthy lifestyle, just like some people with OCD wash their hands excessively, but there's nothing inherently wrong with the behavior itself."
fatlogic,fcxfh79,t1_fcw6j1m,1578061558.0,"Depends. An awful lot of people are just incredibly misinformed about nutrition and unaware of their true eating habits. Plus, food culture in the US is incredibly obesogenic. But that being said, I think there is a real lack of awareness about how people use food in a unhealthy way to deal with their problems, much like alcohol or drugs."
pokemon,fcuh8qy,t3_eiz5x1,1577980908.0,Nice work!
1200isfineIGUESSugh,fcug747,t3_eim2a5,1577980193.0,That's what I need for my next jar of Nutella.
fatlogic,fcu691p,t1_fcsypla,1577973558.0,"Yeah, it makes sense for people who are literally starving themselves but it doesn't for anyone else."
fatlogic,fcu5vjj,t1_fctswnq,1577973306.0,"To be fair, it's not a change but simply the default setting for a lot of people."
asexuality,fcrwep9,t3_eikqs2,1577907545.0,"I don't plan on coming out because I'm really more grey-A which is a lot harder to explain. Plus, there doesn't seem to be any compelling reason. Nobody ever asks me why I'm single and I don't experience discrimination or prejudice the way gay and trans people do."
fatlogic,fcr2x6m,t1_fcp9lau,1577896006.0,"I think we might be body shape twins! I have stretch marks on my thighs from my obese days and now that I've lost the weight, my poor ass just looks...deflated. lol."
fatlogic,fcp4rq4,t3_eiab47,1577850444.0,"Nope, I'm going to keep right on with controlling the size and shape of my body, and you can fuck right off with your anti feminist bullshit. And yes, it is anti feminist because this rhetoric is largely aimed towards women. Nobody cares when male body builders try to control the size and shape of their bodies, but god forbid a woman try to lose weight, out come the concern trolls."
fatlogic,fcp4axj,t3_ei9zpi,1577850034.0,"Let me guess: this person isn't middle aged yet. Trust me, when you hit your 40s, health is the goal."
fatlogic,fcp40ta,t1_fcohxoj,1577849788.0,"Heh, yeah, makes sense."
fatlogic,fcodzv6,t3_ei5j3b,1577829930.0,"I have body image issues because I'm flat-chested. Yes, I'm skinny, but that's not a magic solution to all body image problems."
fatlogic,fcodwe3,t1_fcob0it,1577829861.0,"Yeah, no offense but you're not going to waste away anytime soon. :P"
fatlogic,fcodv8w,t1_fcodgzt,1577829838.0,I often fall prey to that argument. That's why I try to buy treats in single serving packages as much as possible.
madisonwi,fcnt72s,t3_ehjk5j,1577817945.0,"Yeah, that was a nasty surprise. I used to go there a lot."
fatlogic,fcndsew,t1_fcnbdr0,1577809591.0,"I've been trying something new, an anti-to-do list. Basically every time I see an office ""treat"" that I'm tempted by, I make a note of it like I'm making a to-do list except in this case, I only get to check it off if I *don't* eat it. I can't say it's a magic bullet, but I think it's helping take the edge off the temptation a bit."
fatlogic,fcndmvt,t1_fcnd2dl,1577809493.0,"Whoa. That's pretty extreme. Maybe just concentrate on finding healthy, low-calorie foods you like and lay off losing weight as a goal for now. And find a form of exercise that doesn't feel like punishment. There's something out there for everyone."
fatlogic,fcn9eao,t3_ei2y94,1577806633.0,"You know, there's a LOT of foods out there that make me bloated. I eat them anyway, because bloating is overall  pretty harmless and I'd rather deal with the  bloating than restrict my diet to the ridiculous degree that would be necessary to avoid all bloating. And that's my choice and I accept it and the consequences. 

But knowingly eating foods that'll possibly necessitate an EpiPen and a trip to the ER? Yeah, that's a bridge too far. That's just nuts."
fatlogic,fclr7jp,t3_ehthqm,1577754501.0,"The only person who ever talks about his diet to me is my brother, and he's 350 lbs and is frankly pretty justified in wanting to lose weight. Sheesh."
fatlogic,fclqv3j,t3_ehv5cd,1577754259.0,"Okay, so they're diets. So what? People need to lose weight sometimes. We live in a society where we're surrounded by lots of hyperpalatable, high calorie food while at the same time most of us working sedentary jobs. Of course it's easy to gain weight if you're not careful. Of course people are going to want to lose weight if they gain too much. You know what's really toxic and unrealistic? Expecting people to not care what they weigh. Your weight has a direct impact on your self image and quality of life. It's only natural to care about your weight."
fatlogic,fcj6avy,t3_ehael4,1577678334.0,"Intermittent fasting isn't my jam, but some people swear by it, and good for them. I wish I could do it, it would be nice to not have to bother with eating at work,  but I just get too hangry to make it stick. But that doesn't mean it's inherently wrong. Different strokes for different folks."
fatlogic,fcj5jne,t1_fch69ep,1577677800.0,It's a relief to know I'm not the only one.
fatlogic,fcj5hwc,t1_fch45z6,1577677765.0,I think it's generally considered to be part of the left wing culture though.
fatlogic,fcgl3ed,t3_eh6ews,1577641305.0,My desire to maintain a relatively thin physique has nothing to do with anyone else. You do you and let me do mine.
fatlogic,fcgkql8,t3_eh6ews,1577641197.0,"I'm tired of the smug, patronizing tone of so many left-wing activists. I'm left-wing myself but they're turning people like me off."
fatlogic,fc0mswe,t3_ef5220,1577294768.0,Oh god yes yes yes.
