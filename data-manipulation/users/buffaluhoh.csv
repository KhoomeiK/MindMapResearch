Crazy read, what a tragic event."

todayilearned,fdi0k2b,t3_elbk1a,1578433579.0,"There is an interesting case about a man known as H.M. He underwent surgery to help his epilepsy in 1953 but,  unfortunately as a result, he became unable to form new memories. While living at a care institute, researchers worked with him every day to develop the ability to draw using the reflection in a mirror. Although he couldn't remember drawing all the times before, each time he did it he was better than before. This demonstrated to researchers that motor skill learning or 'muscle memory' rely on different neural structures than memory of episodes or facts. Unfortunately, he never regained his ability to form new memories like this teenager.

politics,fblokxj,t3_eds3t7,1576966280.0,"I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis while living abroad.  I joined a FB group for it and there were so many stories of people trying to cover insane monthly RX costs in the US and some of these people even had insurance! Without insurance and traveling around I tried to use diet to control my mild symptoms, convinced that the prescription I needed would cost too much wherever in the world I was. Thoughts about my future and following this strict diet were causing me a lot of stress, so my boyfriend in Italy encouraged me to go to the doctor to get a prescription. Once I went to the pharmacy to get it filled I actually almost cried. Without insurance, the monthly cost was only $30 there. I'm afraid to return to the US knowing what kind of financial burden I might face."
