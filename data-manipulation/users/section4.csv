Wellthatsucks,fgcl89d,t3_exmmhu,1580673710.0,Ha ha I spent about 20 minutes trying to super slow motion capture a ladybird taking off. It has gotten at from the daughters paddling pool so was getting stuck and I kept going it over and over. It flew off when it was processing one of the shots.

AskReddit,fgbjnxj,t1_fgbjc1d,1580662744.0,My friend left his headset on when he was playing with his workmates and they heard him asking his girlfriend to rim him.
AskReddit,fgbiqgw,t3_exr5ml,1580662532.0,"My friend is very full of himself and he had a profile on Plenty Of Fish that I found out about. He listed himself as a 'comedy genius' and also a semi professional poker player. He is neither, but his ego was massive and I had known him 15 years so knew exactly how to get him. 

I signed up as a 21 year old nail technician and messaged him saying he sounded like fun. His messages were so cringy it was hilarious. I never once made any suggestion I fancied him, just gave him banter. Told him I'd been stuck in salt mines dodging monkeys or that I'd crapped my knickers at work. Random stuff. After 2 weeks he showed me these messages this right fit bird was sending him. I had to make my excuses and leave and full on belly laughed down the street.

After a month, I told the lads it was me and that I arranged to meet him on Friday in a pub near us. A few messages went round telling people and about 30 of us were there to greet him and tell him it was bollocks. I could go on at length at some cringy stuff from it but I'll keep it short. 

A little cruel but he was/is the kind of guy who thinks he is better than others and puts people down to make himself look better. So I take him down a peg or two from time to time."

dashcamgifs,fga3uhc,t1_fg9z9k5,1580646405.0,Yeah looking again at the car after contact (couldn't take my eyes off the person falling before) it clearly is shooting off fast. I should point out that I also do see car drivers doing silly things to pass too and not just single out bikers.
AskReddit,fg9hfkw,t3_exgy9m,1580638833.0,"Not what someone said to me or what I heard... But what I did. 

I was coming up hard off a double drop in a club and needed a poo. I went to the toilet and unloaded but then realised there wasn't any toilet roll to wipe. I was levelling off a bit as I sat there and had the brainwave of using my socks. I took them both off and I wiped but I only needed to use one sock. So when I came out the cubicle, there was a dude waiting to poo so I was stood there, jaw gurning madly, eyes rolling around in my head and I offered him my other sock to wipe his bum with. I got a few strange looks but didn't really realise it at the time because I was a bit fucked. He was quite polite and declined.

I hope he still tells people about this happening."
dashcamgifs,fg9fq56,t1_fg8fiam,1580638270.0,We don't see the start. Has the car passed the bikes? Or are the bikes just riding in his blind spot? I travel quite a way for work and the amount of silly things I see bikers do to pass cars is crazy.

Showerthoughts,ffzetob,t3_ew2mxv,1580375464.0,"We can. For ages I loved the smelling of sage and onion stuffing. It looked great and the way people enjoyed it made me feel envious. So I kept trying it every so often. Now I have it on all my roast dinners and love it. 

Also when we were kids, the only chocolate my sister's would give me out of selection tubs were the coffee ones. I didn't like them but I was a kid and it was chocolate so I ate them. I learned to love coffee chocolate."

interestingasfuck,ffhlcvm,t3_etkph5,1579940714.0,"That doesn't look that good compared to what we used to use. We used a egg shell system where the pipes were clipped in the shells. Then the liquid screed could completely surround the pipe meaning that the whole pipe would heat the screed. This way in the video means the very top of the pipe is doing the heating. 

Maybe if it's a tile going on top it might be ok but still wouldn't be as good. 

I used to tank, insulate, soundproof and screed floors so came across lots of systems."

I originally played through as usual, shield and sword. I tried a mage build and managed up to the Iron Keep (hate that place) and I've gone back to sword and shield. I just like to roll round the side and stick a sword in their ribs."

Wellthatsucks,fetmjcw,t3_eqh91o,1579376874.0,It's in Bolsover which isn't that from where I grew up up. It's a shit hole.

sadcringe,feqtfps,t3_eqb4vy,1579345822.0,"Some people don't understand their phones or how to put their old contracts in. I bought a Google phone in 2009 and have the same contacts each new phone that started from there. Some people lose their phone and have no idea how to get their old numbers back because they either don't understand or forget their log in. 

Little story, I had dated a girl early 2011 l and it cooled off a little and just had the odd text here and there from each other. I had to send my phone off for repair so used an old phone we had at work. Like a 2002 Nokia crap and just had the numbers on the sim of my family. I got a text saying ""hi"" so I asked who it was. Silly for not saying why I had no numbers but turned out to be the girl I had had a couple of dates with. She didn't buy it when I told her why I didn't have her number and she genuinely thought I had deleted her number. 

So it might not be as nasty as the guy took it."

The walk in people were told by me about my leg as well as my ankle. The doctor had been told several times by me that my leg didn't feel right. Nobody even bothered to look at it. The walk in x-rayed just the ankle and the doctor referred me to physio. The physio couldn't believe it. He said it's so common and shouldn't have been missed."
