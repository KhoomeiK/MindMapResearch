She also believes that the reason Koreans didn't get sars is due to the greatness of kimchi. She told my brother (a physician) that kimchi is why koreans are so healthy, this while claiming that she is always so sickly.  I asked her if that was true then why is she ""sick"" all of the time.  She said, ""well I am a special case.""  Which basically translates to, ""I'm a special snowflake."" My brother was polite, but told me after that conversation with her that she is crazy.

My taiwanese dad believes that if you get a perfect score on the SAT, you'll get bonus points.  Makes sense? No, well AP logic, sorry!
He also believes that Peking duck is made the ""right"" way here in the US compared to China and that Taiwan is better at making sushi than Japan.

We've got two sets of parents in their mid to late 70s, one with dementia, they are looking into assisted living options, another who has always been difficult and now has some medical issues mixed in AND she wants to live with us, but that can't happen due to personality differences,  so she is is going to make a big stink about it when we start talking more about assisted living options.  

We have 3 kids, two who are teenagers and will be going off to college, the oldest is only 2 years away from that, so we are trying to save for them.  We're also dealing with our careers, my partner has hit the highest level he can go, I am stuck in the land of the consequences of boomers who stayed in their positions too long and now I'm competing with millennials for positions,  but ageism,  yay!

UUreddit,fffz6tr,t3_etawal,1579895001.0,"This really depends on the congregation.  I go to a small rural congregation that is located in an area that was traditionally (has been hit hard with the recession and not recovering) manufacturing-oriented and agricultural.  Basically, we're in Trump country.  When I first started attending about 14 years ago, I think it was mostly people with bachelor's degree with a few professional/PhD demographic and an older crowd.  However, now it is a pretty wide mix.  The number of actual affluent members is actually very small, I would say maybe 10%, most are middle class, but there are IMO more masters degree holders, but we have a lot who are older or younger that struggle financially.  However, our congregation also covers about a 40-mile radius and even then is very small, bc it is mostly evangelical christians in this area.  The next closest congregation is completely different than ours, with noticeable affluence and a lot more programming, it is also about 5x bigger in attendance than ours.  Our little congregation just manages to squeak by year to year.

Edited to add that our congregation actively seeks to be engaged with diverse populations.  One issue is that we are in a UU historic church that is located in a rural bedroom community.  To reach more diversity, we need to be IN the city, they know that, but bc our church is historic, it is hard to walk away from it.  The good thing is that POC (I am a POC) who do attend are very pleasantly surprised, but no, many are not going to wander into a rural community for church, so our location poses another challenge in terms of access and outreach."

My parents were not happy with my husband and even after being happily married to him for 20 yrs, having 3 kids and doing well financially they still hold onto their original biases that were never based on facts, but just on their feelings and bigotry. You can't win, so if they cannot be supportive of your marriage and your spouse, time to put up higher boundaries. My mil has held bias against me bc I'm not Korean (I'm Taiwanese), and she has never gotten over this, and even though he other dil is korean and they get along terribly.  So with both sets of parents we have very high boundaries,  we've gone no/low contact with them a few times and I have no guilt about it. You have a right to live your life and to protect your spouse against your crappy mom, or she will ruin your marriage.  My mil tried very hard to do that to both of her sons and in the end she has caused a lot of tension in the family bc she still doesn't understand why her behavior was not ok."

One tip that made sense after the fact was that the best that a workplace will ever treat you is when they are trying to recruit you.  So if you are being treated poorly during the recruitment phase, then beware, they will probably treat you even more poorly once you are hired.  FME, this has been true."

I've found that people are quick to jump to ridiculous assumptions if you aren't white, for something benign that you may do. 

I left a toxic workplace 3 years ago, my supervisor had an asian dil who she resented and I felt like she took it out on me. Since I couldn't prove it, I couldn't say anything, but she definitely treated me with underlying animosity that was unwarranted and would make comments about how much she hated Asian foods, etc.. the HR director there was a sleaze and guilty of sexual harrassment and bc I was not entertaining any pretense of coddling his ego he gave me a hard time, I definitely felt like he tried to judge me with the stereotype that asian women are submissive and easy. I was told that I was ""intimidating."" Really?  Nobody else felt that way, I was extremely competent at my job and bc I didnt fulfill the stereotype of the passive asian, rather I'm pretty assertive, it made them feel uneasy,  even though that was their issue, not mine. 

When I finally got fed up when the bullying from my supervisor,  HR and my supervisor's pet idiot (another racist, and a giant trouble maker in general), I quit. I know that the HR guy was sweating it, thinking I'd sue. I would not put it past him to never hire a minority again with the assumption as a mediocre white man that our only goal as a protected class is to take advantage of our minority status and that as a white man he would actually be held to consequences, which he felt was unfair.  Basically he wants to discriminate.  He is a misogynist in general and is rather crappy toward any employees who take maternity leave and tries to get rid of them."

jobs,fey9ia4,t3_eqoa35,1579442522.0,"You don't.  I stuck around a year longer than I should have at a toxic workplace. The bullying escalated to mobbing when finally submitted an offical complaint to HR (HR director was one of the biggest bullies and ha sexual harassment lawsuits against him from employees if you can believe it). They threatened me, I'm actually a protected class but by that time I was just so done I quit. I was their top performer, their mouths hung open when I quit,  bc they have a history of doing this to all of their employees, but bc people are scared to lose their jobs, they let the abuse happen. I am lucky that I have a spouse who is supportive and earns enough that me quitting was not a life and death thing for me.  However I should have got out sooner.  I kept thinking that one of the main bullies, who was supposed to have retired, would be gone soon and things would get better.  Well they finally chased her out after I quit, and then turned around and hired another jerk who was just as bad. It took me 5 months before finding another job, and it sucks that now I have a 5 month gap that will be questioned, but the immediate response from my body when I walked out of that building was striking. 

Start looking for a job now. Do not quit, but check out at work and focus on your job search.  Good luck and I hope your next job is one that treats you well."
raisedbynarcissists,fey2k4b,t3_eqs4ti,1579439890.0,"My ndad and I got onto argument two years ago. He was recently diagnosed with dementia, so I think this is why he slipped up.  However he full out admitted to being abusive to me (sg of the family) and tried to justify it by me not wanting to be ""good.""  This was the first time ever he has ever come close to admitting anything.  What made me mad was his determination in his mind that I was ""bad,"" when that is so untrue, HE is bad! I went no contact last year after nmom withheld a legal document from me that I needed on purpose,  but gave to my two siblings, while announcing to them that she was purposely going to withhold it from me. Basically the two of them truly only think ill of me, no matter what I do, in their mind I am somehow enemy #1, I have been what others would consider a perfect daughter, but when you ask my parents they make me sound like I am some sort of horrible person. It's in part one reason why I went NC. They are just so determined to always think poorly of me.  To my face they credited something nice that I did to my siblings and my siblings flat out called it out to their face and they still insisted on giving what I did as credit to them, but not me.  You cannot win with Ns. It's just better to go NC.

Sometimes Ns will tell you exactly what they think. My nmil slipped last year after I told her to stop acting inappropriately, she told me that she will never change and to stop trying to change her.  Um, I'm simply just requesting that she show some decency, but I guess to her that is too hard! Yup, that's true, despite how many times she lied and says that she is always trying her best.  Nope, not trying her best, just trying to force everyone else to cater to her."
AskWomenOver30,fetfgoj,t3_eqgpal,1579374924.0,"I'm still in the process, and I have had some hiccups, so it hasn't been perfect, but thought I'd share of it helps to inspire and motivate other women.  Most of all resilience is a key component. I have shared my story with others before and they are always surprised that I persisted and broke out of the mold. Yes I took the curvy path, but it is so much more interesting and has really helped me to brand myself in a unique manner. I'm in a profession that typically has a very straight path, so my experiences make me a bit of an oddball.

I found out during my last yr in my BS degree that I did not get an internship that was crucial in order for me to sit for my boards, essentially having wasted all that time and tuition on what felt like a useless degree. I was a top student, had work experience, leadership skills and was well liked. My professors said each year one student gets screwed who should have gotten an internship but didn't, and unfortunately that year I was that student. Instead of waiting a year and trying again with no guarantees, I pursued another BS degree that was a good pair with my first degree, did an accelerated degree, graduated, passed my boards, worked my butt off, got a ton of experience, applied for a specialization program, but realized that a former vindictive boss (she was upset that I didn't give her 2 months notice when I left that job, yup 2 months!) basically badmouthed me to the point that I was thrown out of consideration for the program,  even though my coworkers with similar backgrounds and less education got into the program (they were shocked I did not get a spot). That was another big blow, especially after my first experience not getting the internship for my first degree. By then my partner and I were ready to start a family in our late 20s, but dealt with infertility. After several miscarriages and with the help of meds, I was able to have 3 kids.  I spent 10 yrs as a sahm, essentially throwing off my career trajectory. However, I did a ton of volunteer work during that time that thankfully helped me to sustain some professional relevance. 

At age 40, the summer before my youngest was going to start kindy, I got a full time job at a university in a completely different field of my sector. Basically I was starting over at an entry level position, but I was happy for the opportunity. I killed it at that job, among 66 other coworkers in my region, within 6 months I was ranked #3 for my productivity. #1 and #2 had to work close to 5 years to get to their level of productivity and they were astonished that I did it in 6 months and were picking my brain to try to figure out how I was able to do this.  It was just pure hard work and self motivation mixed in with the ability to effectively network and partner with other agencies (which many of my peers were not good at). 9 months into that job, an opportunity popped up and I left that job for the next doubling my salary and moving into a mid level position. My supervisor from that university job is still a friend of mentor of mine, she couldn't promote me though due to my lack of a masters degree that was their university policy (this will come in later in my story).

My next position was both my best and worst.  The best bc I loved it, the work was complex yet allowed creativity that I had never encountered in my field. I was the top performer in my dept and as the team lead we were making huge strides. I got noticed on the local, state and federal level (local govt agency) and thrived in a position where I was constantly being challenged and learning. The problem was that I had a supervisor and coworker who were very jealous of my success, I never realized that being successful could out a giant target on my back. I dealt with bullying that I tried to rise above, but was hanging on bc I was up for promotion for a senior leadership position.  When the bullying escalated to mobbing (remember my supervisor was one of the bullies and then she got HR on her side), my health was negatively affected and I ended up quitting, even though I loved that job.  I was crushed, I walked away from a potential promotion that I had worked hard to get and unfortunately when that position was finally open the person they ended up hiring has undone so much of the work that we had accomplished. Keep in mind I never in a million years would I have ever quit a job without another lined up, it was just so incredibly toxic and dysfunctional I felt that I  had no choice, essentially I was pushed out, bc they starting making threats.

I spent the next few months trying to figure out how doing everything right could turn out so wrong. However, luckily bc I was so well liked by everyone except for the bullies (I'm still in contact with my old coworkers and actually helped many of them get out, since I left the entire dept has turned over 2x in 2 yrs if that tells you anything), a position was created by another organization that I had worked with, and they recruited me for that position.  This is a much larger organization, I went into it as a subject matter expert,  so the only transition was trying to learn how things worked internally at a new organization.  You could say that this was a lateral move, but I have felt that I have gone through a lot of personal growth during this time and having to deal with more office politics and figuring out how to navigate those situations. Once again my work was highlighted at the national level (this organization was not a national company), I helped us to achieve accreditation during my time as well.  I decided last summer that my two BS degrees weren't enough for positions that insisted on a Masters and it was a barrier to my career growth so I am currently back in grad school and will finish my degree next year.  I've learned a lot about how important office politics can be in career advancement or being stonewalled.  I've also learned to continue being resilient and to keep developing myself professionally. Surrounding yourself with people who are supportive and respectful is so important. My parents are NOT supportive and have always kicked me down at every opportunity. My husband, specific colleagues and friends have been integral in how I have been able to get to where I am today.

I hope to move into a more senior leadership position sometime in the next two years. In fact my dream job just posted and I am sending my resume in. It is senior level and would allow me the ability to lead an organization (nonprofit) to make an impact.  I am qualified, with the exception of having a masters (which I'm working on and which I hope will be taken under consideration). Wish me luck!"
