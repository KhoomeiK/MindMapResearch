AmItheAsshole,fg8aqcm,t3_exeh5e,1580614105.0,"NTA - I went to a dinner with 8 people once, had one drink and the bill was $600 because of drinking. They wanted to split and I ended up paying nearly $200 for 1 meal and 1 drink. One person decided they didn’t drink alcohol so they threw $20 on the table. It was bullshit and I never went out for dinner with any of them again."
Parenting,fg82el1,t3_exc22d,1580607702.0,"What 7 year old doesn’t love having the attention all on them? On your weekends with him, do you take time with him, just you and him? Or is it always with your wife and siblings? He might be trying to tell you (in his 7 year old way), that he wants one-on-one time, or is feeling rejected by you? Remember, you’re the adult and he is a 7 year old child. When he turns 18 or 30 will he resent you for not being in his life?"

askatherapist,ffo8yik,t1_ffo6yzb,1580075261.0,"The little voice saying “what if you’re judged”, is an obstacle that might even spill over into other parts of your life, and stops you from doing other things. If you tell your therapist this, they should be able to help you navigate the obstacle so you don’t even care if you’re judged and you continue to do your thing. Good luck :)"

askatherapist,ffnzrar,t3_euckhq,1580072732.0,A professional therapist won’t judge you. Their job is to support you through the tough times and help you move forward. Your problems are not smaller than others. Everyone has their own unique experiences and their own pain. Your therapist will help you navigate these. If you feel judged by a therapist move to the next one until you find one that you feel comfortable with.

AmItheAsshole,ffjdoap,t3_ettdbn,1579996087.0,"NTA - your partner cries to manipulate you and get their own way. They do not value what you want, and your input in the relationship. It might be that you need to have a calm conversation about it, and let them know it’s going to end up driving you away from them. They need to decide if they want to mature and grow in the relationship, or it might be that you let them go..."

askatherapist,ffhhqfm,t3_etngd4,1579935762.0,"You have every right to be angry. Just because someone changes or gets better, it doesn’t absolve the pain that they brought upon you in your childhood.

askatherapist,ff419qm,t3_erfrrm,1579553356.0,I’m a bit late but in this situation it’s best to contact your therapist office and let them know. They can make the decision and may have an alternative like Skype or a phone consult. Feel better soon :)

AmItheAsshole,fei5r4i,t3_ep4bpf,1579130887.0,"NTA - however, someone needs to teach this child the difference between appropriate vs inappropriate questions. These are teaching moments. As she goes through life she may struggle with friendships and relationships. She is going to be a teenager soon and with her lack of boundaries she is being opened up to being bullied or abused. The parents need to get their shit together and quickly, or their going to have a tornado teenager ripping through their home (or yours)!"
