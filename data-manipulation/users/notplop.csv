The real service dog bounced back quickly but it was rattled and ended up missing a seizure detection for the first time in two years.

A different story. A service dog we follow on Instagram ran into access issues at a restaurant. They demanded to see ID and the handler was showing them the ADA website and explaining they don’t need one and that he performs tasks X Y Z for her disability. They argued about it and denied her access because “service dogs need IDs.” So everyone coming in with their fake service dog and flashing around IDs makes some less informed business owners think that’s required, and deny access to real service dogs."

The second is personality predictability. I know exactly what the temperament standards are for a golden retriever. I know exactly how they should behave in various situations. In addition to that, I know how my dog’s parents, grandparents, and great grandparents temperaments were and what their personalities were. We live in a dog friendly apartment complex with lots of kids, so there were a lot of risks we couldn’t afford with getting a rescue dog with little to no information about their temperament.
