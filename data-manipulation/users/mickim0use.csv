oneanddone,ff89r38,t3_es5yrk,1579670210.0,"Bit different situation, but my mom didn't support my choice in husband and made it very apparent. Her snarky remarks and talking behind our backs and saying horrible conniving things where I could hear her, and it wasn't until I told her, deal with it or don't. That's up to you. But if you cannot be civil then you will not have a relationship with me or your grandson. We lived in the same town at the time. So it was extra harsh as she would see me around but I wouldn't even look at her, nonetheless talk to her. Mind you, my mom is my best friend aside from My husband. So it was incredibly hard. But it took me cutting her out for months, no contact whatsoever, for her to finally realize that I was serious. She thought she could force me into her mindset because of how close our relationship was. She didn't realize how serious I was. We now have a fantastic relationship again and she has amended her issues with my husband. Happily married 7 years now and she's also accepted that were OAD, although shes never been overwhelmingly vocal in that, But she has had her two sense in. But I don't think she will push me on that because she's learned that she can't bully me. Love her dearly, and our relationship is a bit rockier than it used to be, but it was never perfect to begin with. Best of luck. Hope it all works out. Stay strong and true to yourself. If she supports YOU, then she will come around eventually."

Lol honestly I think it’s not so much fine tuning the response as less caring about their thoughts. To people who I value, family members, friends, I still nod and say “oh yeah, we’ve always considered having another” whenever they point out how “the second will be easier because xyz...”
But I honestly feel like these conversations are always rooted in a desire to confirm their own decisions of having more than one. Our child is insanely well behaved compared to our friends kids and they always have to point out the reasons why they had another, as if excusing the bad behavior of their kids as being a result of having siblings (which was the better choice than having an only).

I remember all the negatives perfectly and thus focused on taking pictures and videos of the cute and proud stuff. Looking back at his baby pictures is something I love to do because I honestly don’t remember much good about the first 3 years but the pictures help me remember what actually was good.

Parenting,feh2n4x,t3_ep2nak,1579107864.0,"First off, glad you guys were safe and what a good pup!

I'm going to second what most people have already said and say to just answer any questions that your son has but don't go into any unnecessary detail. 

Kids are very risiliant. They don't process danger the way we as adults do. Just an example, but my dad has talked to me about growing up in Vietnam during the war there. He saw people shot, people lit on fire in the streets, all kinds of scarring stuff but he often remarks how he has no PTSD from it. It actually doesn't bother him at all. It all happened when he was 10 or younger. I mention this because I believe children use information to make rules about the world. They don't see doomsday the way we do. Of course this is also personality based as some of us have more anxiety than others. 

For your son it was probably as simple as, ""There was a bad guy that tried to break into the house. The dog scared away bad guy. Good pup. No one got hurt. That's good."" And it's as simple as that. 

It may be good to explain to himwhat to do in case that ever happens again and he's awake. He should understand an emergency plan with rules on what to do if it occurs again. Kids like rules. 
Hope this helps."
oneanddone,feh1kyy,t3_ep4e6y,1579107232.0,"Oh I really liked this. Especially towards the end. Creating boundaries and showing that it's not unfair even if they think it is. 
My 5 year old is playing the blame game right now. A prize toy he got in a candy egg doesn't work like it's supposed to and he says I broke it with anger and tears streaming down his face. I've been working with him on understanding that sometimes life happens and it's  no one's fault. Bonus for being an only as I was able to go into depth with this until he understood it. About 15 minutes of sitting on the floor with my full attention. 
However, does anyone else have recommendations on helping with cleaning?
He says cleaning is boring. And yeah. It is lol
We've done timers for picking things up, but more often than not I clean up his toys for him cause I get fed up and he's able to drag out not picking things up. It depends on his mood tho. Sometimes he's happy to help. Other times he will practically throw a tantrum to not clean. Is it too young to expect chores from him? I feel like I baby him more because hes an only, but I also have high expectations. Very much yo-yoing. I want him to grow independent but also stay my baby boy."
AnimalsBeingDerps,feg3x2r,t3_eoxben,1579075796.0,I am so doing this to my dog tomorrow
oneanddone,fecasfb,t1_feb0rb5,1578969760.0,"Personally for me, my hormones are forever out of wack now. I used to never cry at movies or anything. Tough in that sense. But since having my son I'll start bawling the instant something is even slightly emotional. Like those America got talent clips, I am a mess. I thought it would get better. But that part hasn't. As for my son, my protectiveness is there, but now that he's 5, he can talk, is more independent, I find myself pushing him into the Independence side of things. I don't want him to be a baby. But I baby him when I need to, like he just had the flu. He will always be my baby when he's sick. 

However this brings me to my second point. My son and I are sooooo close. I never thought my son would end up being a best friend. And he's five lol me and him are super close. And it's just getting better as he's getting older. I came from a divorced family and have a brother. I didn't get close to my mom until I became an adult. So this relationship with my child is new to me. But a lot of what I've read, and noticed from comparing to families with more than one child, is I'm able to give him sooo much more attention. That attention, and the ability to work through problems and questions that he has, that I wouldn't have the time to do if I had another,that has really made the difference. 

As for having another kid, I've wanted two kids my entire life. Literally since I was a toddler myself. But my son changed things. We were going through a lot when our son was born. It was stressful for me, my husband, and especially our marriage. That’s the deciding factor for us. Doing the first 4 years over again with a new child is too much for us. Now, we both always want another child. But for us, the pros of where our life is, how our son is turning out, and our close relationship to him is enough to make us happy with our decision for OAD. Plus, the other pros of OAD, the financial side, going on vacations with him, the ability to pay for things for him and give them the best life possible, something I didn't have, is important to me. 

Hope that helped answer your questions!"
oneanddone,feavptm,t3_eoakg2,1578952656.0,"I would suggest relaxing on your worries for now. Give yourself some more time. You have A few years to choose OAD or more. Your hormones are super strong right now. After giving birth, and while your child is so vulnerable still, youre feeling a heightened sense of protectiveness. This is normal. You have time to make a decision. My husband and I visit the option of having another child every single year from the time our son was born. Every year we weigh our options as so much changes from one year to the next. Our son is 5 now and I just replaced my IUD. We are OAD. But I'm sure we will continue visiting the possibility of having another every year. It's natural for us to worry that were making the wrong choice. Just take your time and really identify your feelings. I started writing down anything on my mind everyday. Journaling has helped identify my feelings behind certain things, allowing for better decision making. I feel more certain with my choice after heavily analyzing my options. Stay strong."

The possibility of adoption is always on the table, but time isn't an issue when looking at that option as we didn't want our kids to be too far apart in age if we did have another biologically. Takes the pressure off. My recommendation is to always visit the option, your life will be drastically different every 6 months. You're just at the beginning of childrearing.
