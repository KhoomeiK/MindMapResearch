But these are adjustments to income, your definition of income is going to different from mine. Most of the complexities in the tax code are there because someone figured out a smart complicated way to avoid recognizing income and the code addressed it. Or someone was getting hosed and the us code threw them a bone. Then the state realized they'd lose revenue so they disallowed that federal handout, and there's another state adjustment.  Wash rinse repeat for 35 years, things get tricky. But it's mostly adjustments to how income is defined."
