I get arm pains, weakness, exhaustion, just an overall downtrodden feeling.

This year was god awful.

Some seriously bad strains hit my area and everyone was round robbining it.

Not sure where I got it but I had the Flu right before I usually get my shot in September. 

The new formulas usually come out in August or September so I aim for middle of September to get my shot.

I had a bout of a headcold first or a mild case of the Flu in August.

September is when I got my ass handed to me. I had to go to the clinic and get steroids and antibiotics for a bad sore throat. It wouldn't go away and it wasn't just hurting but swelling as well. Not strep though.

I had to wait for that to pass.

Then I got sick again. Another sore throat, sniffles.

I said fuck it. Drove my ass to Walgreens and got my flu shot.

Talked to the guy who gave it.

1) the flu shot takes days to weeks to make you immune or semi immune to multiple strains of the flu.

The current flu shot protects you against 4 different types of the flu, one of them being H1N1 aka the swine flu that could've wrecked havoc on the US but was snuffed out due to new vaccines and the current vaccine providing some protection so death toll was very low.

2) as long you do not have the flu with a fever you can get a shot.

3) if you read the papers that come with the shot you realize that there ARE side effects and for some it is very mild, for some you have flu like symptoms, and for a very small amount they have extremely bad reactions that could kill them if they don't get to the hospital. 

Then at the end of October I had a bout of a head cold.

After that, I have been good."
