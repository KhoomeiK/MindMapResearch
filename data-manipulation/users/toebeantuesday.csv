aww,ffradul,t1_ffr9ypp,1580153925.0,"Technically this orange fellow is a peeping Tom, too."
Retconned,ffr4wq0,t1_ffqmwrp,1580150525.0,"Thank you.  Id love to stay here posting (I always read from time to time), but honestly when I do, things go weird for me, and not just on Reddit, but in real life.  Its too uncanny anymore to be mere coincidence in my book.  Something uncanny happened the very night I made my post that Ill take as a warning from the universe or whatever to not come back here to post.  I dont feel safe saying what happened, but I have a friend on this sub who knows and agrees with my decision.  

I give up.  Ill go be a sheep and stay quiet about this ME stuff and the phenomena surrounding it.  The people who know, just know.  The ones who dont, probably never will get it and I wont risk myself or my family anymore trying to convince anyone of things they cant work out on their own. 

Im still around other weird topics about the paranormal, though not the actual paranormal subreddit itself.  But places like Missing 411 and Creepy Encounters and Glitches in the Matrix.  Life apparently stays normal for me no matter what I talk about there.  Ghosts, demons, glitches seem safe topics for some reason.  

And I still like the cute animal posts I originally joined Reddit for.  

I think some of you, judging from things Ive read posted on this sub understand what Im saying...and even what Im not saying... and you know Im not being melodramatic.  Youve seen shit. You know things. 

Anyway, thanks for the support.  I appreciate it."
Retconned,ffr2fbs,t1_ffpwx4p,1580148981.0,Thank you. I still hang out on some weird subjects like Missing 411 and places like that.
Retconned,ffr2deu,t1_ffhf5jd,1580148947.0,Thank you.
Missing411,ffr28yy,t1_ffptug2,1580148869.0,Nah I didnt think you were but I was just explaining why I would not think its a possibility here.  Some skeptics out there might.
Missing411,ffno6kb,t1_ffkwwy4,1580068439.0,"Ill have to agree theres definitely altered perceptions involved in his experience, but OP doesnt mention anything other than pot.  Some of what is described does match up with what other people report perceiving when they have strange paranormal encounters.  Ill give OP the benefit of a doubt on this because this story fits in pretty well with the others Ive read. 

Ive had to describe some really bizarre experiences and so far, the Reddit community has been very generous in taking me at my word, so Ill return that courtesy unless there are glaring problems in an account."
aww,ffkwd2e,t1_ffkt27b,1580030204.0,Sorry about Hammy but your mother did the right thing.  It would have been hard to attend to his hygiene and he would have suffered painful urine scald.
Thetruthishere,ffkvyqj,t3_eu3ckc,1580029991.0,"Yeah my last neighborhood was infested with a variety of these things.  Im Christian but the church I grew up in never permitted discussion of any kind about the paranormal, so when I encountered these things as an adult in my last house, I was helped by Muslims who said they are djinn.  Muslims have a special prayer of banishment for them but I only recently learned of it from a Muslim Redditor. 

Heres the link that was shared:

Theres a common factor in your experience, mine, and that of other people who have related similar stories and that is a lingering death, most of the time from cancer, seeming to be the catalyst.  These things feed from human misery and grief and despair.  

Ive only seen them.  If I smelled one I cant be sure because I didnt see it at the same time and well, my dog did farts that could strip the wallpaper off the walls. Lol. So who knows.  

My daughter has seen and heard them and when she was very little was similarly tormented like your little brother after her beloved cat passed away and she was grieving.  I consulted her pediatrician on the matter to see about getting a child psychiatrist on standby and we did.  Fortunately the thing  bothering her the way your brother was harassed abruptly left one day.  

In our case, there was one particular house where first one owner then a second one died of cancer.  The infestation spread from there.  Even if my neighbors could not see or hear  or acknowledge these things, I could see the affects the sheer numbers we had around was having on people.  We had a really severe problem with domestic violence suddenly crop up in three families, which is just uncanny in a nice family neighborhood.  

I know my story isnt very coherent. Its not fun to remember. Ive posted about it before.  

Dont think on them too much. Think about the things and people you love that make you happy.  Its kind of like battling Dementors."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ffkp49j,t1_ffk4j14,1580026448.0,"Lol! Nice effort, though."
Missing411,ffj15j0,t1_ffizem5,1579987775.0,"Whoa, sounds like you had a close call with something nasty.  Ive lived most of the first half of my life near some kind of wooded area.  The woods behind my childhood home was really deep. A man was hiding in there and trying to abduct me when I was really little, but even after that, nothing creeped me out about that particular woods.  But Ive since been to others that werent even really worthy of being called woods that had a creepy feel to them.  I dont know why."
Missing411,ffiys9s,t1_ffixksx,1579986050.0,"Ive never smoked pot or ate the brownies or anything like that, so I dont know what the effects are.  I take it from your reaction and thoughts on this experience that theres nothing about pot that would account for what you experienced...is that correct?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ffiabxr,t1_ffia6fi,1579969114.0,"Lol, maybe!"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ffhk1oz,t1_ffhfdo2,1579938844.0,What is that thing? Is that a person trolling? Theres still some things on Reddit I just havent figured out yet and these dadbot posts are one of them.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ffhf96b,t1_ffhdjqh,1579932781.0,"I believe you.  Ive seen some strange things. 

More along the lines of what happened to you, about 18 years ago my husband and I were making a road trip and we stopped to get burgers. He dropped a sizable piece of his burger along with a pickle and it should have just been right there on his lap.  Except inexplicably it wasnt.  

Of course we didnt want that thing rotting in the car.  The car had no air conditioning and we were in the south in the summer, so rotting fast food was going to reek in no time. So we got out and looked everywhere for the bit of burger and pickle.  It was not anywhere.   We even checked to make sure it didnt fall to the ground when we got out to check the seats and the floor of the car.  It was nowhere to be found.  It surely never rotted and stunk up the car.  It never turned up when the car got thoroughly cleaned after the trip.  

So after that experience, along with reading about similar stories other people have had, I just accept these things happen.  I suppose Ill find out how and why someday when Im dead and theres a big reveal.  At least I hope thats how it works. Otherwise I will be very disappointed.  Lol."
Retconned,ffhdcak,t3_et71r2,1579930701.0,"Im still here, in case anyone remembers me at all. I wasnt active here for very long before I ran into trouble and had to leave.  

I had to stop posting here at Retconned because I got into a strange exchange with a member a month or two ago. He accused me of being paid (by the government??) to harass him into removing his posts.  It was the strangest conversation Ive ever had with anyone anywhere and I still dont know what I said wrong to upset him to the level I did. 

I was trying to relate an anecdote about me and my husband and well, all hell kind of broke loose somehow and he tore some strips out of me in some pretty foul language.  Ive read and reread that exchange and still cant comprehend how it got so effed up.  I know Im awkward, but dang! But Im not here to make people feel persecuted, accidentally or purposely, so I promised him I would ban myself and leave Retconned to him. 

He hasnt posted since then, so I guess its okay to drop by and say Im still as Mandela Effected as ever.  Im still one of you guys, even if I cant be a part of discussions here anymore.  I did unsubscribe, as I promised that guy I would. But I enter Retconned into my search from time to time to keep up on whats going on in the community.  

I dont try to talk about MEs anymore.  When I did, when I was more active here, I noticed I attracted more hostile reactions to myself day to day, all around, and things just got bad.  Lots of bad luck.  Weirdly so.  

Things in my life seemed to be getting more unsettled and unpleasant.  It was just sort of weird, like I had attracted the attention of some sort of control system that was trying to smash me down.  Who needs that, right?  And it wasnt lost on me that I was feeling persecuted the way that fellow claimed I had made him feel.  Thats some twisted crap right there.  

Its kind of crazy.  We seem too close to some sort of truth here on Retconned. But none of us really knows what the hell that truth is.  Ive seen some amazing ideas and theories but they only seem to explain bits and pieces of all the strangeness I see people observing and discussing on various other topics.

Oh by the way, Im doing well enough.  Once I stopped posting here, my life went back to normal-ish.  I mean, I post on other weird and interesting topics and dont ever seem to provoke the kind of strangeness to center over me that I noticed when I was active here.  

Whatever ME is, its more than us remembering things differently from each other.   Theres something deeper and more profound going on.  Honestly I dont want my life shredded again so Im not going to look too closely at it.  I rejected the download, but I accept the fences that those who accepted it live within.  

Well, I really dont have any more to say.  I dont like breaking promises to people, even if the dude to whom I made the promise to leave seems to have disappeared, himself.  So Id better see myself out again.  

You all take care.  Thanks for the kindness and empathy you all showed me while I was here."
Thetruthishere,ffgu4da,t1_ffgstyl,1579915110.0,"Its interesting in that they referenced belief in paranormal stuff based on other experiments not described in this document.  Its a very old document so it was declassified either because it is out of date and paranormal discoveries since then are more advanced than we can imagine or it was all a dead end and waste of resources.  

I have experienced paranormal events, so Im convinced the former is true.  If you havent, you will naturally and logically believe the latter is true.  Either way, neither of us is in a position to know for sure, but you have the stronger position than I do.  

My husband is a complete skeptic despite having experienced at least three paranormal phenomena that I witnessed.  If he wont believe or even acknowledge what he has directly experienced, I wont feel at all slighted if a complete stranger isnt convinced by that document."

AnimalsBeingJerks,ffgm742,t3_etbjm5,1579909472.0,Lol. Oh my goodness. Well I used to have a cat that would barf a small river as soon as I walked through the door.  I got her message loud and clear. Cats can be very expressive.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ffglzov,t3_etgymo,1579909333.0,"At least you got to see it when it vanished.  There are plenty of stories on this sub about things going missing and turning up elsewhere in an inexplicable manner, but the actual vanishing is almost never seen.   What you experienced is truly rare to actually witness.  Ive known for a few years now that our reality isnt as mundane and straightforward as its been made out to be.  Theres a bit more magic and wonder in it than that.  Theres some dark stuff, too.  At any rate, its an interesting world."
Thetruthishere,ffgkpr9,t3_eth9po,1579908466.0,"Well the basic and most important message of Jesus is that we are loved and we are to love one another as we love ourselves.  Thats an empowering message to embrace and probably at least part of what your uncle meant to convey.  Ive also had dreams and communications with dead loved ones and love was always at the center of those communications. They really want us to be comforted, it would seem."
Blep,ffgkbku,t1_fff2kne,1579908206.0,"Its hard to tell from this photo but it looks like his ear is already tipped.  Anyway I agree with your post.  My outdoor buddies are almost all caught, vaccinated, fixed and tipped.  Sigh...one male is proving to be a bit of a challenge."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ffgk1y3,t3_ete23d,1579908030.0,"I once read an article about how the way our eyes are structured means we are actually receiving the images upside down and somewhat opposite to how they are and our brain has to put process this image back into the way things actually are. 

So its more likely that your brain glitched in that your received a portion of unprocessed information.  But I dont know...theres also a lot of lore and anecdotes about the strangeness of mirrors."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ffgirl5,t3_etg57r,1579907181.0,"Best glitch since the renewed donut glitch I read about yesterday.  I like it when the universe gives us presents! Anyway now that there are two rings maybe the original can go to someone else who loved it or wanted a keepsake or something.

My condolences on the passing of your mom. It sounds like shes having a bit of fun."
Eyebleach,ffgif3g,t3_etedtw,1579906950.0,Cloth egg. Very cute.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ffceubt,t3_esp79r,1579797942.0,"What a funny coincidence. I just read this and went on to scroll down on Reddit and Cassius the Comedian Cat had a donut joke: Im opening a dispensary that sells doughnuts and weed.  Im calling it Glazed and Confused. 

Lol..did you get your donuts from Glazed and Confused?  That might explain it! 

If I had been your sister I would have eaten the evil donut and see if I get any super powers."
Humanoidencounters,fevuorn,t1_fet23q3,1579401744.0,Yikes! I think the demon laughter and snarling sounds less scary than dealing with a live-in dysfunctional in-law.  Congrats on the successful exorcism! lol
Humanoidencounters,fess6te,t1_feqldcd,1579368469.0,"From the previous house?  No, I am sure it didnt.  I still visit the old neighborhood from time to time and its still strange.  The very atmosphere feels so dark.  

The neighbors that remained are starting to open up more and when I ask them how things are they give a weird expression and laugh and say things are a bit odd.  But they dont elaborate.  I know even when I still lived there one of the neighbors who lived in the house where I think the problems originated and spread from left abruptly with her family.  They took their clothes and small items but tried to leave their furniture, which they ended up selling or giving away. 

I dont see the stuff that happened in my old neighborhood happening here."
Humanoidencounters,fesr6gi,t1_feqm6p4,1579368146.0,"Ive definitely noticed the shit hit the fan shortly after my daughter was born in 2004.  2005 was when everything got freaking weird.  At first I thought it was post partum stuff so I got treated for that and got my health checked out very thoroughly.  

But no...things were weird and I did a bit of scouting around on the internet and found out I definitely was not the only one noticing reality looking a bit more cracked than usual.  

A friend and I think CERN might have had something to do with it, only due to the timing.  But correlation does not equal causation so Im not betting even a dollar on it.  Its just something to consider. 

I did come across something about a Project Gateway that another Redditor posted awhile back.  Its from the CIA website.  Its a declassified document and talks about the experiments and studies that have been conducted.  They essentially accept the paranormal as a given and not as something left to be scientifically proven.  

Heres a link to the document if youre interested. But its long and boring, so be prepared to fall asleep while reading it.  Once you accept that this stuff is real, its strangely boring.  Yeah these things are scary, but so is a shark or a pissed off bear.  However, it does seem some people are more vulnerable to suffering greatly from the paranormal and they do deserve respect and consideration and concern.

Humanoidencounters,feso6xz,t1_fepvt9z,1579367334.0,"Lol!  I think they are produced on an assembly line somewhere. I actually have two of them and its a tossup which one Im thinking of when I make an in-law joke.  

However, I do actually get along pretty well with both, though I prefer my husbands sister over the one who married my husbands brother. The latter is a bit of a Karen and actually does often demand to speak to the manager about things.  

But Im sure they could tell an in-law joke or two about me, too.  Lets be real here: Im on Reddit talking about the paranormal and Mandela Effects and pets.  So, who the hell do I think I am, really? Im kind of the stereotypical weird middle aged sister-in-law.  I know it and I own it!"
Humanoidencounters,fepocze,t1_fepgfim,1579325988.0,"I think they mean the voice was telling her dont go because some big creature was lurking around.  

Ive heard a demonic voice like that INSIDE of my house before.  My previous house is the one that had all the paranormal stuff going on in it.  But it was in this one I live in now where I heard demonic laughter and a snarling noise come out from under my daughters bed.  We had just moved in and I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor by her bed while she got used to the new house sounds.

It was a gorgeous morning, sun was shining in through the window and birds were singing. It was the absolute last time and place I would have expected to hear the voice of something hideously creepy that was not my sister-in-law. 

I sat up and was about to wake my kid and get us some breakfast when the demonic laughter and a growling (or was it the other way around?) came from under her bed.  So basically if there was a monster under the bed, it would have been level to my face if I were still lying down. I made the executive decision to NOT look under the bed.  Some things are better left unseen.  Bad enough I heard it.  

I then heard a slight whoosh sound like it had left.  Or maybe that was wishful thinking.  But I didnt hear anything else.  

I thought to myself Well, shit.  I thought we left that crap behind at the last house. 

Actually I had never heard anything like that at our previous house.  This was pretty flipping scary.  But what can you do?  Most of the time these things are one-offs.  You cant predict where they will pop up so you cant really avoid the phenomena.  In order to predict, youd have to understand why it happened in the first place.   I dont know how you go about doing that.  

My observation is that these encounters seem to be more common for everyone in the last 15 years or so.  As people get used to telling these stories on the internet, they start talking more in real life and you start to hear things and realize this creepy shit isnt as rare as one would think. As Ive gone through life, Ive personally noticed an uptick in weird paranormal shit. And of course I cant prove it, but Ive noticed more wandering spirits or entities that arent permanently haunting anything but just seem to be passing through and dropping by to see what trouble they can stir up.  Thats not something Ive noticed happening at the first two houses Ive lived in during my married life.  Something changed at some point in the last 15-20 years or so.  At least by my observations.  

I think some government sponsored asshole opened a portal somewhere."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fep1lii,t1_feoy83h,1579310099.0,"Try not to freak out.  The fatigue thing is hitting everyone I know the last week or so.  We arent in Austin, we are more coastal and so are my friends, and thats all I feel comfortable divulging.  

Theres been some weirdness for one of my friends where theres fatigue and also she is trying to enter her credit card to do online purchases.  She carefully typed the number and her husband even watched her to confirm what she is typing but the numbers get changed on the screen. My daughter is meticulous about where she puts things and they end up elsewhere.  So whatever it is going on, its not just you so just take a deep breath and roll with it."
Thetruthishere,fekctjz,t1_fek8rez,1579197364.0,"Well I really wouldnt call it interacting.  My mom seemed completely oblivious to her family.  And even though I saw my mom when I was having my experience, I had barely enough functioning intelligence to react to her at all.  Its NOT a positive experience at all.  Do. Not. Want.  Im very glad it has never been repeated.  

If I want to visit someplace, I will get in my car or walk to it with my physical body and my mental faculties intact so I can truly interact and enjoy the visit.  Our minds and bodies are such an incredible gift, and I intend to take care of and treasure mine for the time I am blessed to have them.  

The resistance I felt was like pushing through 
super strong wind resistance, but without any sensation or sound of wind.  Its hard to describe.  My mom never felt anything like that. And in my other suspected OOBEs I never felt that, either.  It was just that one time.  

Maybe something about being very visible contributed to the feeling of resistance.  I dont remember if my mom said I looked transparent or solid.  I could ask her again, but the incident happened about 20 years ago and even back then from her perspective, with being taken by surprise by something so astonishing, it happened so fast she didnt have much time to really take it all in.  

I appreciate that you think the experience sounds cool, but I have to really emphasize how unpleasant and dehumanizing and downright frightening and depressing it is to know what its like to have yourself stripped down to the intellectual and emotional capacity of a crawling baby.  It is such a basic level of existence.  It does not bear thinking of actual human beings reduced to this state permanently, IF that is what some ghosts actually represent.  Its horrifying for a life to end up in that state of being.  If I ever run into such a spirit, I will pray for them to find peace and rest."
Humanoidencounters,fejrzwa,t1_fejbcqr,1579184398.0,"Good lord thats a level of detail that is mercifully missing from my own experiences!  I cant ever hear anything.  It is just visual only.  Had it been otherwise, I know my arachnophobia would not have let me take those experiences as calmly as I always did.  Its been years, so I cant quite remember how realistic the textures were.  

Also, Ive been nearsighted for years.  Im not sure how clearly I was seeing them without my glasses on.  Do you even need glasses to see a fuzzy inter-dimensional spider look less fuzzy? 

Putting on my glasses requires enough waking coordination and purpose to end the experience.  Thats why I would never have suspect any level of reality to the experience had my kid not spoken up about seeing the spider, without me having said I was seeing a spider.  I firmly believed they were hallucinations related to the dream state of the mind persisting into wakefulness.  And who knows, maybe they are but my kid was seeing what I saw due to some kind of toddler clairvoyance kids that age are reputed to occasionally display. 

I wonder if the spider we saw together persisted visually long enough for me to try and take a whack at it because another person besides me was seeing or projecting or somehow facilitating its existence."
Thetruthishere,fejqac7,t1_fej9t8w,1579183114.0,"It honestly is not exciting at all. My mom was never aware she was doing that. Her experiences just faded into her dreams. She said she remembered walking around her brothers house and her moms house, which werent even in the same country as her and in opposite time zones.  So she would be asleep and they would be awake.  She just thought she was dreaming about being back in those places.  Meanwhile, they would essentially see her ghost haunting their house.  Phone calls ensued to ensure she was in fact not dead.  Thats how she learned about it.  

The verifiable time I did it, I was taking a nap in my home.  Next thing I know I am popping out of a wall into my old bedroom at my parents house.  My was in the room sitting at her makeup mirror and she looked up and of course was shocked to see me.  I was looking all around and for some reason I was angry but I dont know why.  I felt a strong resistance to my every movement.  I looked around and made eye contact with my mom and she said my name and basically asked me what I was doing there and if I was okay.  I woke up back in my room and ended up confirming the entire experience with my mom right away in a phone call.  Really it was all over in about a minute or two.  It was not an exciting experience, but it was significant. It confirmed for me that we have the ability to separate some part of ourselves from our bodies. 

What I didnt like about the experience is that I was definitely operating at a very reduced intelligence level and a very basic level of emotional existence.  It was like being a toddler.  A very stupid toddler.  And I didnt have any sense of control over my own thought process or emotions. I could recognize my mom and frown at her and that was about it.  Ive read the sub for people who actually have OOBEs on purpose and they seem to retain their sense of self and their agency better.  They have a very different experience of it than I did, meeting spirit guides or stuff like that.  

Given my experience, I can understand why ghosts in typical haunt stories are such pains in the ass.  Theyre not really capable of sophisticated levels of thought and interaction, just basic emotions and reactions and anger is probably the easiest one to access.  

Which is entirely different from contact with loved ones who have passed on and are allowed to visit from time to time.  In that case they have a specific purpose for communicating with the living and seem more themselves.  My mom had a visit from her deceased parents when she was going through breast cancer and they assured her she would be okay.  Ive had a couple of friends with similar stories. And I had my own similar ghost story.   

So I would guess someone who doesnt know theyre dead and was forced out of their body all of a sudden and didnt pass on isnt their full self.  Thats very sad and horrifying.

There were a few other experiences I had in my childhood that Im pretty confident were spontaneous OOBEs, but without any way to verify them with another person, I cant take them seriously."
Thetruthishere,fehjm81,t3_ep3cid,1579117882.0,"I would certainly not rule out your theory for some cases.  But Ive seen it when my mom had a spontaneous astral projection (while napping) and shes seen it when I had one.  We projected facsimiles of our clothes.   I think normally people who have an OOBE are invisible.  I have no idea why we were visible, at least to each other.  Shes popped out and been seen by other members of her family.  That happened to me and only the one time, thank goodness.  I dont relish being a ghost before my time and I absolutely can not understand people who actually try to do this on purpose.  

Well the point of that boring anecdote is that I would not rule out ghosts as some form of spiritual remnant just because theyre clothed.  Though you raise a very good question on how and why clothing and other reported accessories are part of ghost sightings."
Humanoidencounters,fehczb3,t1_fegg5y8,1579114007.0,"The movement is realistic. The looks arent, because its way too big. Which is both i unsettling and reassuring at the same time."
Humanoidencounters,fefppm2,t1_fefj0zg,1579061722.0,"Cool, I never considered that possibility before.  Like Ive said, I never thought these things were real until my kid showed that she was seeing what I was seeing, too.  With kids as small as she was then, I had to be very careful asking her what she saw when we talked in more depth later.  Because the power of suggestion is too strong for little kids.  

Anyway, Ive gotten into discussions with Muslims who said they might be Djinn.  And that would not necessarily conflict with what youre saying."
Humanoidencounters,fef87hp,t1_feeaj0f,1579050488.0,"No, they cant hurt anything. I dont know what they are.  I am pretty sure theyve taken other forms besides spiders but I cant for the life of me remember what.  Its been about 12 years since Ive seen them.  I see something now thats similar but not as defined."
Humanoidencounters,fef7ri4,t1_feeju5c,1579050186.0,"Lol, yeah you know I was fine thinking all my life they were hallucinations. But when my kid indicated she could see it, I thought Holy shit, how the hell did a huge spider get in the house and how the eff do I kill this thing?  Because it looked like it was about a foot across!  Like one of those Alaskan crabs at the seafood restaurant.  

I was closing in on it praying it wouldnt jump at me like a wolf spider and I realized it wasnt really there.  Mostly because it kind of receded and faded out a little the longer we were awake.  

It wasnt long afterward Id come across people on forums talking about these things.  So its apparently a thing.  

Once you realize its not really here in a material sense it is fun to watch.  Even for an arachnophobe.  

I dont see these things at my new house that Ive been in for close to 5 years.  I do see blobs that are connected to my forehead.  Its like a shadow of a big wad of chewing gum that is stuck to me and pulled away.  Weird stuff."
aww,fee79sj,t1_fee2hh9,1579027860.0,"She looks lame shed take your fingers off! She is pretty, though."

I watch them crawl around.  But I only see them in two houses that had other paranormal activity.  And one time when I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor of my toddlers room because she kept having nightmares, I woke up one morning to see the giant spider on the wall.  My daughter was already awake and she saw my eyes tracking it.  I thought it was a hallucination, I mean I always did.  But she said to me, So you see the giant spider, too, Mommy?

I then had a Ron Weasley moment and jumped out of the bed and grabbed a plastic toddler chair and was going to bash it but as I got closer to it I realized it wasnt really there.  It was like a shadow person, which we had a lot of in that particular house.  

So I grabbed the kid and fled the room and got breakfast.  

We talked about it at breakfast and we figured out we both saw it moving in the same way in the same location of the room.  So it wasnt a mere hallucination.   

I then shifted through years of memories of these things that I had been absolutely certain had been simple products of the nervous system and saw them in a new light.  I just dont know anymore.  There is always a weird feeling in my head almost like theyre pulling something from me to manifest.  My daughter says the same.

I had to get all kinds of tests to confirm my brain is actually healthy, just migraine prone if Im exposed to certain triggers, mostly stuff thats easily avoided like soy.

At any rate I dont have a particular opinion on that document, but it goes to show where the interest and funding and supportive environment for paranormal studies is, and its not the universities.  

Universities tend to study things they can patent and make money on. The paranormal is something lucrative if you weaponize it or incorporate it into a surveillance and control system, so naturally the government is going to monopolize and classify any research that a university does do.

You dont really have any obligation to engage with strangers at all, beyond the courtesy required to do your job. 

Ive never read it, but a lot of people here recommend a book called The Gift of Fear by Gavin De Becker for these stranger danger situations. Perhaps it would contain something helpful for you.  

Alert whomever the manager of your store is to what is going on.  Go with the coworker who experienced his aggressive behavior in asking questions about you.  You can discuss whether or not they can somehow get photos or surveillance video saved on this guy in case he escalates the harassment.  

Start documenting times and dates of any incidents and encounters.  Write down as much detail as you can remember about previous ones. Documentation and hard information is important if you need to escalate this to the police if he escalates his harassment.  You want to go to them organized and very calm and collected with information they can act on when they can, if necessary. 

Im sorry youre going through this. Unfortunately, too many of us women have, especially at the age youre at.  Especially those of us who exude social awkwardness that some people mistake for passivity and shyness.  

Part of this is psychological warfare and youre almost battling yourself more than him at this point.  I know, Ive been the one hiding behind counters and partitions at work at the sight of dreaded customers.  I know how hard it is to switch to the necessary gears.  But is has to be done. 

And another thing: stop saying its my fault in regard to mistakes and missteps youve made.  Its not a fault.  Its just a lesson learned.  Life is challenging and doesnt come with an instruction manual.  Youre allowed to make mistakes.  Now is not the time to belittle yourself. Now is the time to build yourself up to the formidable adult youre going to spend the rest of your life as.  

You need to start working to see yourself not as his victim, but as someone he will regret messing with.  I dont mean get aggressive with him.  Just work on holding a confident demeanor when hes around and when he tries to engage with you, boldly state that you have work to do and cant chat.  You dont owe him any explanations even if its clear you dont have anything to do at the moment.  

Youre a professional getting paid to do your job, not be his entertainment.  If he gets pushy, that will go into your documentation and to the manager on duty.   Give him a firm emotionless look right in the eye and walk away to your manager.   

He is out of line.  He is wrong.  He is the one who is at fault for ignoring your boundaries."

The kitten attacking something so much bigger is channeling fear aggression and Ive seen the outcome of this in a rescued cat when it becomes ingrained due to the behavior being ignored.  It is not a good outcome.

If this behavior isnt checked by a mother cat or other cats, humans need to step in, otherwise it can continue into adulthood when it becomes dangerous and unpredictable for everyone.  Its usually the mother cat who usually socializes the kittens out of randomly aggressive behaviors that emerge in play and teaches them to channel their instincts into hunting prey.

Perhaps because they werent yet adapted to the more open environment of a typical suburban area.  Ive seen two that were truly as evil and foreboding as the one you experienced and my poor little girl saw one and woke me from a nap to stop one that was materializing at my bed side.  I feel bad for the kid growing up with these things around.  At least the cat one was interesting. 

Once and only once the bed lifted up a few inches on my side and dropped while I was in it reading. Thats the only time I ever saw anything get moved paranormally in that house.  If it were the shadow beings doing that, they apparently werent able to move stuff and be visible at the same time.  

Ive moved and not seen them here at this house while awake. My daughter and I have seen them a few scattered times over the years in sleep paralysis dreams. Theyre annoying in these and seem to be trying to force or trick us into out of body experiences but they scatter when told to get lost. But the nature of sleep paralysis is one of those tricky areas in which its hard to say what is real and what is just a product of ones own mind.  So take that part of my experience as I do, with a grain of salt.  Interesting, but nothing to base conclusions on.  

When I sought advice about them in forums before it was Muslims who seemed to have the most detailed lore about them that matched up well to what I was seeing.  Read up on Djinn from Muslim sources.

A Muslim Redditor says this recitation is the most powerful one that drives these beings away:  

http://www.aquraninstitute.com/ayatul-kursi.html

Im a Christian, so Im not sure if using a Muslim recitation is respectful of their faith or might be considered a sort of appropriation.  I just included it here to say that at least someone somewhere knows about these things and has a way of dealing with them.  

Im not going to ever start a paranormal thread of my own because I joined Reddit initially to enjoy and converse about pets.  Im afraid people who follow me or look me up based on my posts about those pet topics look at my posts in these stranger topics and think wtf?.  Lol.  

Unfortunately once a person has been touched by phenomena like this, it is almost like a form of PTSD and makes it impossible to look at the world the same way again. I find Im forever drawn to trying to understand my own experiences by reading about the ones other people have had.  Thats one reason I felt compelled to post to you.  I can see you were deeply and profoundly affected by your encounter with this entity and I wanted to let you know there are others of us out here who have seen them. 

I first saw what might possibly have been a form of them in the late 80s-early 1990s when my mom was really sick.  My dad and I noticed this flickering at the edge of our vision and little shadows shuffling at our feet.  Id feel sort of nervous and get goosebumps when that happened.  We did a family prayer and a house blessing and that seemed to work at their house. 

Nothing I tried at my last house ever really fully cleared the place.  Had I known about that Muslim recitation back then I might have tried it out of desperation.  It was really the whole street that was infested.  The houses to either side of me developed severe domestic violence problems and our family was always stuck in the middle calling the police and helping when we could. I do think these things can affect human behavior even among people who cant see them and dont believe in such things."
Thetruthishere,fcb4vu0,t3_egxnu1,1577582381.0,"Im sorry to hear of the passing of the young coal miner.  My respects to his memory and to his friends and family. 

I was reading your stories because I read a very disturbing mine story several days ago about someone who was doing some kind of surveying job in a WV coal mine that was due to be permanently sealed. On their return trip to the exit, they had seen a little girl at one of the side tunnels. I couldnt understand why they didnt stop or alert someone to find out who she was or get her out of there. Im a mom of a daughter myself and all I could think of was all the children on missing kid posters and all those missing 411 stories.

So I saw one of your mine stories to try to better understand why the OP of that thread didnt think he saw an actual human.  I think I understand now.  

What an environment! I dont think Id last ten minutes down there.  Not because of the shadow beings, but the material hazards and just being underground and always under threat of danger and darkness.  That alone would unnerve me. 

As for shadow beings though, I guess I got used to them, at least in a suburban setting where I guess they dont manifest quite as strongly.  I had lived for 10 years in a house absolutely infested with shadow beings.  I saw them even out in the yard in broad daylight, though not under direct sunlight.  There were quite a variety of them ranging from humanoid and very ominous to small and animal like and seemingly benign.  

There was a little cat shaped one that used to run into walls when my cats would chase it.  It disappeared for a few years and resurfaced to act like a real cat with my daughter when she was little.  She knew it wasnt a cat because neither of us could look directly at it.  It was like our eyes would be forced to look a little bit to either side of it or it was shifting just too much beyond the center of focus.  All of these shadows were like that. 

They actually infested our whole neighborhood and I think they might have originally been drawn out to the suffering of a homeowner who died of cancer.  Then the next person who bought his house had a wife who was diagnosed with cancer within a year and also died.  The next family remodeled the house and moved very abruptly one year after I saw a massive evil feeling shadow being walk through the exterior wall into their house. 

Theres a lot more I could say about my experiences there and with those creatures but Ive got to join my family now.

A friend and I think CERN might have had something to do with it, only due to the timing.  But correlation does not equal causation so I’m not betting even a dollar on it.  It’s just something to consider. 

I did come across something about a Project Gateway that another Redditor posted awhile back.  It’s from the CIA website.  It’s a declassified document and talks about the experiments and studies that have been conducted.  They essentially accept the paranormal as a given and not as something left to be scientifically proven.  

Here’s a link to the document if you’re interested. But it’s long and boring, so be prepared to fall asleep while reading it.  Once you accept that this stuff is real, it’s strangely boring.  Yeah these things are scary, but so is a shark or a pissed off bear.

Humanoidencounters,fepocze,t1_fepgfim,1579325988.0,"I think they mean the voice was telling her “don’t go” because some big creature was lurking around.  

I’ve heard a demonic voice like that INSIDE of my house before.  My previous house is the one that had all the paranormal stuff going on in it.  But it was in this one I live in now where I heard demonic laughter and a snarling noise come out from under my daughter’s bed.  We had just moved in and I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor by her bed while she got used to the new house sounds.

It was a gorgeous morning, sun was shining in through the window and birds were singing. It was the absolute last time and place I would have expected to hear the voice of something hideously creepy that was not my sister-in-law. 

I sat up and was about to wake my kid and get us some breakfast when the demonic laughter and a growling (or was it the other way around?) came from under her bed.  So basically if there was a monster under the bed, it would have been level to my face if I were still lying down. I made the executive decision to NOT look under the bed.  Some things are better left unseen.  Bad enough I heard it.  

I then heard a slight whoosh sound like it had left.  Or maybe that was wishful thinking.  But I didn’t hear anything else.  

I thought to myself “Well, shit.  I thought we left that crap behind at the last house.” 

Actually I had never heard anything like that at our previous house.  This was pretty flipping scary.  But what can you do?  Most of the time these things are one-offs.  You can’t predict where they will pop up so you can’t really avoid the phenomena.  In order to predict, you’d have to understand why it happened in the first place.   I don’t know how you go about doing that.  

My observation is that these encounters seem to be more common for everyone in the last 15 years or so.  As people get used to telling these stories on the internet, they start talking more in real life and you start to hear things and realize this creepy shit isn’t as rare as one would think. As I’ve gone through life, I’ve personally noticed an uptick in weird paranormal shit. And of course I can’t prove it, but I’ve noticed more wandering spirits or entities that aren’t permanently haunting anything but just seem to be passing through and dropping by to see what trouble they can stir up.  That’s not something I’ve noticed happening at the first two houses I’ve lived in during my married life.  Something changed at some point in the last 15-20 years or so.

Thetruthishere,fekctjz,t1_fek8rez,1579197364.0,"Well I really wouldn’t call it interacting.  My mom seemed completely oblivious to her family.  And even though I saw my mom when I was having my experience, I had barely enough functioning intelligence to react to her at all.  It’s NOT a positive experience at all.  Do. Not. Want.  I’m very glad it has never been repeated.  

If I want to visit someplace, I will get in my car or walk to it with my physical body and my mental faculties intact so I can truly interact and enjoy the visit.  Our minds and bodies are such an incredible gift, and I intend to take care of and treasure mine for the time I am blessed to have them.  

The resistance I felt was like pushing through 
super strong wind resistance, but without any sensation or sound of wind.  It’s hard to describe.  My mom never felt anything like that. And in my other suspected OOBE’s I never felt that, either.  It was just that one time.  

Maybe something about being very visible contributed to the feeling of resistance.  I don’t remember if my mom said I looked transparent or solid.  I could ask her again, but the incident happened about 20 years ago and even back then from her perspective, with being taken by surprise by something so astonishing, it happened so fast she didn’t have much time to really take it all in.  

I appreciate that you think the experience sounds cool, but I have to really emphasize how unpleasant and dehumanizing and downright frightening and depressing it is to know what it’s like to have yourself stripped down to the intellectual and emotional capacity of a crawling baby.  It is such a basic level of existence.  It does not bear thinking of actual human beings reduced to this state permanently, IF that is what some ghosts actually represent.  It’s horrifying for a life to end up in that state of being.  If I ever run into such a spirit, I will pray for them to find peace and rest."
Humanoidencounters,fejrzwa,t1_fejbcqr,1579184398.0,"Good lord that’s a level of detail that is mercifully missing from my own experiences!  I can’t ever hear anything.  It is just visual only.  Had it been otherwise, I know my arachnophobia would not have let me take those experiences as calmly as I always did.  It’s been years, so I can’t quite remember how realistic the textures were.  

Also, I’ve been nearsighted for years.  I’m not sure how clearly I was seeing them without my glasses on.  Do you even need glasses to see a fuzzy inter-dimensional spider look less fuzzy? 

Putting on my glasses requires enough waking coordination and purpose to end the experience.  That’s why I would never have suspect any level of “reality” to the experience had my kid not spoken up about seeing the spider, without me having said I was seeing a spider.  I firmly believed they were hallucinations related to the dream state of the mind persisting into wakefulness.  And who knows, maybe they are but my kid was seeing what I saw due to some kind of toddler clairvoyance kids that age are reputed to occasionally display. 

I wonder if the spider we saw together persisted visually long enough for me to try and take a whack at it because another person besides me was seeing or projecting or somehow facilitating its existence."
Thetruthishere,fejqac7,t1_fej9t8w,1579183114.0,"It honestly is not exciting at all. My mom was never aware she was doing that. Her experiences just faded into her dreams. She said she remembered walking around her brother’s house and her mom’s house, which weren’t even in the same country as her and in opposite time zones.  So she would be asleep and they would be awake.  She just thought she was dreaming about being back in those places.  Meanwhile, they would essentially see her “ghost” haunting their house.  Phone calls ensued to ensure she was in fact not dead.  That’s how she learned about it.  

The verifiable time I did it, I was taking a nap in my home.  Next thing I know I am popping out of a wall into my old bedroom at my parents’ house.  My was in the room sitting at her makeup mirror and she looked up and of course was shocked to see me.  I was looking all around and for some reason I was angry but I don’t know why.  I felt a strong resistance to my every movement.  I looked around and made eye contact with my mom and she said my name and basically asked me what I was doing there and if I was okay.  I woke up back in my room and ended up confirming the entire experience with my mom right away in a phone call.  Really it was all over in about a minute or two.  It was not an exciting experience, but it was significant. It confirmed for me that we have the ability to separate some part of ourselves from our bodies. 

What I didn’t like about the experience is that I was definitely operating at a very reduced intelligence level and a very basic level of emotional existence.  It was like being a toddler.  A very stupid toddler.  And I didn’t have any sense of control over my own thought process or emotions. I could recognize my mom and frown at her and that was about it.  I’ve read the sub for people who actually have OOBE’s on purpose and they seem to retain their sense of self and their agency better.  They have a very different experience of it than I did, meeting spirit guides or stuff like that.  

Given my experience, I can understand why “ghosts” in typical haunt stories are such pains in the ass.  They’re not really capable of sophisticated levels of thought and interaction, just basic emotions and reactions and anger is probably the easiest one to access.  

Which is entirely different from contact with loved ones who have passed on and are allowed to visit from time to time.  In that case they have a specific purpose for communicating with the living and seem more themselves.  My mom had a visit from her deceased parents when she was going through breast cancer and they assured her she would be okay.  I’ve had a couple of friends with similar stories. And I had my own similar “ghost story”.   

So I would guess someone who doesn’t know they’re dead and was forced out of their body all of a sudden and didn’t “pass on” isn’t their full self.  That’s very sad and horrifying.

There were a few other experiences I had in my childhood that I’m pretty confident were spontaneous OOBE’s, but without any way to verify them with another person, I can’t take them seriously."
Thetruthishere,fehjm81,t3_ep3cid,1579117882.0,"I would certainly not rule out your theory for some cases.  But I’ve seen it when my mom had a spontaneous astral projection (while napping) and she’s seen it when I had one.  We projected facsimiles of our clothes.   I think normally people who have an OOBE are invisible.  I have no idea why we were visible, at least to each other.  She’s popped out and been seen by other members of her family.  That happened to me and only the one time, thank goodness.  I don’t relish being a ghost before my time and I absolutely can not understand people who actually try to do this on purpose.  

Well the point of that boring anecdote is that I would not rule out ghosts as some form of spiritual remnant just because they’re clothed.  Though you raise a very good question on how and why clothing and other reported accessories are part of ghost sightings."
Humanoidencounters,fehczb3,t1_fegg5y8,1579114007.0,"The movement is realistic. The looks aren’t, because it’s way too big. Which is both i unsettling and reassuring at the same time."
Humanoidencounters,fefppm2,t1_fefj0zg,1579061722.0,"Cool, I never considered that possibility before.  Like I’ve said, I never thought these things were “real” until my kid showed that she was seeing what I was seeing, too.  With kids as small as she was then, I had to be very careful asking her what she saw when we talked in more depth later.  Because the power of suggestion is too strong for little kids.

Humanoidencounters,fef7ri4,t1_feeju5c,1579050186.0,"Lol, yeah you know I was fine thinking all my life they were hallucinations. But when my kid indicated she could see it, I thought “Holy shit, how the hell did a huge spider get in the house and how the eff do I kill this thing?”  Because it looked like it was about a foot across!  Like one of those Alaskan crabs at the seafood restaurant.  

I was closing in on it praying it wouldn’t jump at me like a wolf spider and I realized it wasn’t really there.  Mostly because it kind of receded and faded out a little the longer we were awake.  

It wasn’t long afterward I’d come across people on forums talking about these things.  So it’s apparently “a thing”.  

Once you realize it’s not really here in a material sense it is fun to watch.  Even for an arachnophobe.  

I don’t see these things at my new house that I’ve been in for close to 5 years.  I do see blobs that are connected to my forehead.  It’s like a shadow of a big wad of chewing gum that is stuck to me and pulled away.  Weird stuff."

Humanoidencounters,fee4vrx,t1_fede7wt,1579026446.0,"I don’t know what’s worse, seeing people or seeing giant spiders.  I see giant spiders.  Even after I’m awake and sitting up.  I watch them crawl around.  But I only see them in two houses that had other paranormal activity.  And one time when I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor of my toddler’s room because she kept having nightmares, I woke up one morning to see the giant spider on the wall.  My daughter was already awake and she saw my eyes tracking it.  I thought it was a hallucination, I mean I always did.  But she said to me, “So you see the giant spider, too, Mommy?”

I then had a Ron Weasley moment and jumped out of the bed and grabbed a plastic toddler chair and was going to bash it but as I got closer to it I realized it wasn’t really there.  It was like a shadow person, which we had a lot of in that particular house.  

So I grabbed the kid and fled the room and got breakfast.  

We talked about it at breakfast and we figured out we both saw it moving in the same way in the same location of the room.  So it wasn’t a mere hallucination.   

I then shifted through years of memories of these things that I had been absolutely certain had been simple products of the nervous system and saw them in a new light.  I just don’t know anymore.  There is always a weird feeling in my head almost like they’re pulling something from me to manifest.  My daughter says the same.  

Like any other human being I have had legitimate hallucinations due to being dehydrated or sleep deprived or stuff like that. That’s different, it doesn’t feel the same."

I had to get all kinds of tests to confirm my brain is actually healthy, just migraine prone if I’m exposed to certain triggers, mostly stuff that’s easily avoided like soy.  And even then I would have to eat a lot of soy.  I actually found out about my condition when I tried to go vegan.

There was a nasty feel around us and we had a lot of hypnagogic events:  our names or laughter would be heard as we drifted off to sleep.  I warded the house with salt and a blessing, so we were hearing these sound outside bedroom windows.  

And someone a few miles away had a psychotic break and shot his family members and a neighbor, I don’t remember exactly what happened anymore. But that was a first for a very peaceful community.

It’s not been a lack of research, but a lack of frank disclosure while the government tried/tries to incorporate/weaponize the knowledge into surveillance and control systems...the usual stereotypical stuff.  

If this is declassified now, it’s either because they couldn’t find a way of making any paranormal research useful and practical, or they’ve advanced to something beyond reckoning.  Or they figure nobody cares one way or the other, as long as we have our distractions."

It’s a long tedious read, considering the subject matter. Leave it to the government to make the paranormal dry and boring.  

At any rate I don’t have a particular opinion on that document, but it goes to show where the interest and funding and supportive environment for paranormal studies is, and it’s not the universities.  

Universities tend to study things they can patent and make money on. The paranormal is something lucrative if you weaponize it or incorporate it into a surveillance and control system, so naturally the government is going to monopolize and classify any research that a university does do.

You don’t really have any obligation to engage with strangers at all, beyond the courtesy required to do your job. 

I’ve never read it, but a lot of people here recommend a book called “The Gift of Fear” by Gavin De Becker for these stranger danger situations. Perhaps it would contain something helpful for you.  

Alert whomever the manager of your store is to what is going on.  Go with the coworker who experienced his aggressive behavior in asking questions about you.  You can discuss whether or not they can somehow get photos or surveillance video saved on this guy in case he escalates the harassment.  

Start documenting times and dates of any incidents and encounters.  Write down as much detail as you can remember about previous ones. Documentation and hard information is important if you need to escalate this to the police if he escalates his harassment.  You want to go to them organized and very calm and collected with information they can act on when they can, if necessary. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this. Unfortunately, too many of us women have, especially at the age you’re at.  Especially those of us who exude social awkwardness that some people mistake for passivity and shyness.  

Part of this is psychological warfare and you’re almost battling yourself more than him at this point.  I know, I’ve been the one hiding behind counters and partitions at work at the sight of dreaded customers.  I know how hard it is to switch to the necessary gears.  But is has to be done. 

And another thing: stop saying “it’s my fault” in regard to mistakes and missteps you’ve made.  It’s not a “fault”.  It’s just a lesson learned.  Life is challenging and doesn’t come with an instruction manual.  You’re allowed to make mistakes.  Now is not the time to belittle yourself. Now is the time to build yourself up to the formidable adult you’re going to spend the rest of your life as.  

You need to start working to see yourself not as his victim, but as someone he will regret messing with.  I don’t mean get aggressive with him.  Just work on holding a confident demeanor when he’s around and when he tries to engage with you, boldly state that you have work to do and can’t chat.  You don’t owe him any explanations even if it’s clear you don’t have anything to do at the moment.  

You’re a professional getting paid to do your job, not be his entertainment.  If he gets pushy, that will go into your documentation and to the manager on duty.   Give him a firm emotionless look right in the eye and walk away to your manager.   

He is out of line.  He is wrong.  He is the one who is at fault for ignoring your boundaries."

It is not a good outcome.

If this behavior isn’t checked by a mother cat or other cats, humans need to step in, otherwise it can continue into adulthood when it becomes dangerous and unpredictable for everyone.  It’s usually the mother cat who usually socializes the kittens out of randomly aggressive behaviors that emerge in play and teaches them to channel their instincts into hunting prey.

Thetruthishere,fcgppye,t1_fcb9rql,1577642796.0,"The ones my daughter and I saw were purely visual phenomenon and didn’t seem able to interact materially.  Perhaps because they weren’t yet adapted to the more open environment of a typical suburban area.  I’ve seen two that were truly as evil and foreboding as the one you experienced and my poor little girl saw one and woke me from a nap to stop one that was materializing at my bed side.  I feel bad for the kid growing up with these things around.  At least the cat one was interesting. 

Once and only once the bed lifted up a few inches on my side and dropped while I was in it reading. That’s the only time I ever saw anything get moved paranormally in that house.  If it were the shadow beings doing that, they apparently weren’t able to move stuff and be visible at the same time.  

I’ve moved and not seen them here at this house while awake. My daughter and I have seen them a few scattered times over the years in sleep paralysis dreams. They’re annoying in these and seem to be trying to force or trick us into out of body experiences but they scatter when told to get lost. But the nature of sleep paralysis is one of those tricky areas in which it’s hard to say what is “real” and what is just a product of one’s own mind.  So take that part of my experience as I do, with a grain of salt.  Interesting, but nothing to base conclusions on.  

When I sought advice about them in forums before it was Muslims who seemed to have the most detailed lore about them that matched up well to what I was seeing.  Read up on Djinn from Muslim sources.  

I haven’t watched these yet but this video series was recently recommended to me.  

https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PLyfPcUoivAtYLK6aIirYy65RieY1kCwBk&v=iYtc1KASfLg

A Muslim Redditor says this recitation is the most powerful one that drives these beings away:  

http://www.aquraninstitute.com/ayatul-kursi.html

I’m a Christian, so I’m not sure if using a Muslim recitation is respectful of their faith or might be considered a sort of appropriation.  I just included it here to say that at least someone somewhere knows about these things and has a way of dealing with them.  

I’m not going to ever start a paranormal thread of my own because I joined Reddit initially to enjoy and converse about pets.  I’m afraid people who follow me or look me up based on my posts about those pet topics look at my posts in these stranger topics and think “wtf?”.  Lol.  

Unfortunately once a person has been touched by phenomena like this, it is almost like a form of PTSD and makes it impossible to look at the world the same way again. I find I’m forever drawn to trying to understand my own experiences by reading about the ones other people have had.  That’s one reason I felt compelled to post to you.  I can see you were deeply and profoundly affected by your encounter with this entity and I wanted to let you know there are others of us out here who have seen them. 

I first saw what might possibly have been a form of them in the late 80’s-early 1990’s when my mom was really sick.  My dad and I noticed this flickering at the edge of our vision and little shadows shuffling at our feet.  I’d feel sort of nervous and get goosebumps when that happened.  We did a family prayer and a house blessing and that seemed to work at their house. 

Nothing I tried at my last house ever really fully cleared the place.  Had I known about that Muslim recitation back then I might have tried it out of desperation.  It was really the whole street that was infested.  The houses to either side of me developed severe domestic violence problems and our family was always stuck in the middle calling the police and helping when we could. I do think these things can affect human behavior even among people who can’t see them and don’t believe in such things."
Thetruthishere,fcb4vu0,t3_egxnu1,1577582381.0,"I’m sorry to hear of the passing of the young coal miner.  My respects to his memory and to his friends and family. 

I was reading your stories because I read a very disturbing mine story several days ago about someone who was doing some kind of surveying job in a WV coal mine that was due to be permanently sealed. On their return trip to the exit, they had seen a little girl at one of the side tunnels. I couldn’t understand why they didn’t stop or alert someone to find out who she was or get her out of there. I’m a mom of a daughter myself and all I could think of was all the children on missing kid posters and all those missing 411 stories.

So I saw one of your mine stories to try to better understand why the OP of that thread didn’t think he saw an actual human.  I think I understand now.  

What an environment! I don’t think I’d last ten minutes down there.  Not because of the shadow beings, but the material hazards and just being underground and always under threat of danger and darkness.  That alone would unnerve me. 

As for shadow beings though, I guess I got used to them, at least in a suburban setting where I guess they don’t manifest quite as strongly.  I had lived for 10 years in a house absolutely infested with shadow beings.  I saw them even out in the yard in broad daylight, though not under direct sunlight.  There were quite a variety of them ranging from humanoid and very ominous to small and animal like and seemingly benign.  

There was a little cat shaped one that used to run into walls when my cats would chase it.  It disappeared for a few years and resurfaced to act like a real cat with my daughter when she was little.  She knew it wasn’t a cat because neither of us could look directly at it.  It was like our eyes would be forced to look a little bit to either side of it or it was shifting just too much beyond the center of focus.  All of these shadows were like that. 

They actually infested our whole neighborhood and I think they might have originally been drawn out to the suffering of a homeowner who died of cancer.  Then the next person who bought his house had a wife who was diagnosed with cancer within a year and also died.  The next family remodeled the house and moved very abruptly one year after I saw a massive evil feeling shadow being walk through the exterior wall into their house. 

There’s a lot more I could say about my experiences there and with those creatures but I’ve got to join my family now. 

Again, I’m very sorry for this terrible tragedy at your old mine.  I pray your former coworker will be at peace."

aww,fc5v7i2,t1_fc5clzp,1577466612.0,I’m sorry your guy has gone missing and I hope you find him soon.  Get posters up because it does help when our friend’s cat got out of the house and went missing for almost a year.  They managed to get some leads and trap him and get him back.

Because I do understand all the love and work you put into everything you had.  And the fact you didn’t lose only things but little family members.  I’m so very sorry."
