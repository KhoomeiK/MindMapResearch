Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fehsf7o,t1_fehqsxk,1579122950.0,"Since the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid the the whole health care industry has been changed. From the onset providers realized they could charge more and Medicare/medicaid would still pay for it, artificially raising the price. And how's that quality of care the VA provides? Cause I know my grandfather and countless other vets have shared their stories of having the hardest times using the system because of how overloaded it is and the amount of procedures someone has to go through to get anything done. If the government had never gotten involved in health care we'd all be way better off today"

Which I argue is a problem with the political system rather than one with the economic system. The government shouldn't have the power that can be captured and abused.

Small government + free markets = more prosperous society."

ofcoursethatsathing,fdlpt2i,t1_fdlh04w,1578529606.0,"What price gouging? It's supply and demand. At private events the operators of the event have every right to charge what they want, you're not coerced into buying it. Similarly, you have every right to buy your own beer and drink it before you go into the private event. If you pay the higher prices then you're signalling to the seller that you value that drink at least as much as what the price is, or else you wouldn't buy it (or you're not a rational consumer but the vast majority of consumers are rational)

Even if we want to go to the typical (at least in Florida where I'm from) example of price gouging at gas stations before a hurricane I still wouldn't be against it. Limited gas, and a huge surge in demand. Basic economics would suggest that prices should increase, so the gas can go to the people most willing and able to purchase (where they only buy so much as they need and no extra due to higher prices) it and also signal to the companies to bring in more gas as there is more money to be made there. It's simple economics, and the most efficient outcome. But instead we don't allow prices to rise in the name of ""fairness"", instead making people wait in long gas lines where people buy and hoard way more gas than they would need just at the thought of scarcity (scarcity that wouldn't exist if prices could rise so more gas would flow in), and people who truly need some gas and would have been willing to pay some more now can't get any due to shortages.

Price ""gouging"" is largely a myth and is just economics working to find the most efficient outcome

AskReddit,fd62afr,t1_fd4v4co,1578184567.0,I'm saying there are better options that running straight to SCOTUS. If other options can't come to a solution yes you might could argue it there.

news,fcl6dxj,t1_fckqrrt,1577740787.0,"It has everything to do with it. With a diverse population you will always have groups that are not entirely represented in the system, marginalized somewhat. They'll be less likely to participate in civic duties like voting. Also with a homogenous group with similar values it's easier for groups to take political stances that larger portions of the voting population agree with, and the more support = more votes. 

You'll never see mandatory voting in the United States, it's just not feasible.
