He used to grab it in his teeth and stretch it until it slipped out of his teeth and snapped back into place. Definitely was not connected by anything more than skin and it weirded me the hell out watching him tug on it endlessly. Never understood why people got rid of the things if they're that entertaining! \[kidding, I actually didn't know they really served a purpose until I read this, but I never sought to have them removed from any of my animals\]"

She'll ask me about sex, drugs, relationships, school, money, whatever, and I do my best to tell her as much of the truth as I can. I use logic to explain things rather than blanketing it with ""because I said so"" mostly because that way she learns, but it also makes it a LOT harder for her to refute it.

Frasier,ffv4cif,t3_eva29j,1580255375.0,"I honestly feel that Niles and Freddie - the name of one of the men who killed his sister although they often called him Frederick - might have been a way to help him deal with the trauma, in a sort of immersion therapy to rid him of any triggers to those names. I have a hard time believing that it's sheer coincidence with names like those... especially Niles."
offmychest,fedqkm0,t3_eog7oh,1579017742.0,"The best thing that can be done is to encourage therapy. I have family members, friends, and exes who have all said their childhood is why they are the way they are, and if they are actively working towards bettering themselves, it will be a grueling endeavor. They will fall, they will inevitably fail, but it's if they can get back up and keep trying to put that past behind them, then they will be able to finally be free. 

Some of the people I've encountered have chosen instead to use it as a blanket excuse, a crutch of sorts, and sometimes saying, ""Oh well, this is how I am because of it and that's that"" as though they should be pardoned for things that happened potentially decades ago. 

I knew a girl a while back - let's call her Martha - who's father had raped her when she was about two years old, her mother was a speed addict and lived in various hotel rooms, and Martha was homeless on the streets as a teenager, which is about when I met her. She moved in with her boyfriend and they eventually got married. He unfortunately fell victim to severe PTSD from an IED explosion in Iraq and began beating and strangling her unconscious once he came back home. Nothing in her life came easy or fair. I lost touch with her shortly after their divorce, but she joined the Army herself for a few years. She had no driver license, not even a GED, but went into military intelligence. You'd never even know any of this trauma had happened to her unless she told you. She's brilliant, kind, artistic, and an all around strong, wonderful person.   
On the flip side, there is another person I know - Paula - who was also raped by her father, along with her older sister. Her mother had been raised knowing women were property and there merely to bear children and take care of the house, so there wasn't much positivity in their lives growing up. No drugs, good life on the outside, clean living. Paula didn't remember what had happened to her until her older sister - who did remember - said something about it to their father after their mother had died, and it ruined Paula's life. She dove into alcohol, became verbally abuse to family members, and any time someone would try to confront her about it, ""It's not my fault I'm this way!"" attributing her behavior to her past. Admittedly, I hit a breaking point and told her she was letting a dead man control her life, and in turn making life hell for her children and grandchildren. She refuses to seek therapy and claims medication doesn't work, so she just continues to lash out at those around her rather than try to change her ways, likely because it takes work.

Somehow Martha has made a life with her demons without taking it out in any way on those around her, and it's all so recent and visceral to her, I'm not sure how she does it. Paula only found out about her demons recently and has used it to make her world a living hell. 

I've recently been getting acquainted with my own past traumas and I'm doing the best I can to keep it from boiling over onto others, but admittedly some days are better than others.

AskWomen,fdytz1x,t3_emzznx,1578783544.0,"Calico Japanese bobtail. She died in October from a long battle with feline leukemia. I found her in the free section of Craigslist when she was two years old. 

She had the typical calico markings - white with splotches of orange and black - but one of the biggest black splotches on her back looked like a happy ghost with its arms raised. I had a picture of it somewhere but I haven't been able to find it. I also loved that the tips of her ears were white. Her left eye was surrounded by orange but her right eye had black going around it perfectly, like she'd started doing her makeup for a night out and became disinterested after using eyeliner on just that eye. Her legs were mostly white, with an orange blot on her right wrist and a black spot on her left, like little wrist tattoos, but an orange blot on her left hind leg and a black one on her right.

Her tail came out straight from her back like a normal cat's tail, but after the first two inches,  it went backwards and into a perfect loop, almost like a drunken cursive capital P. 

She would sit on my chest or back in the mornings and gently pat-pat-pat my face until I woke up, telling me it was breakfast time, or she'd lick my entire face to get me moving. She loved sleeping upside down with her pure white tummy splayed out. 

My friends half the time would come over just to see her. It got so bad, at least two of them begged me to make an Instagram for her. Not my style in the least, but it was easier than sending them picture updates individually all the time. It's ""calicokismet"" and I haven't had the heart to update it regarding her passing yet. 

She was paws down the best little kitty I ever had. RIP my little bunny butt."
