unexpectedcommunism,ffc6wl7,t1_ffbfmul,1579792934.0,"Hitler is greatly talked about by some people who worked for him. (As a normal citizen, not a soldier or whatever). There is this video of a guy saying hitler was a great man and very caring. 

And wasn’t there a girl he cared for? 

People are almost never 100% bad

Edit:

Man who was cared for by hitler

manga,ff9uri6,t1_ff85gti,1579721859.0,Yeah. But idk. Manga is always a bit to sexual. Sometimes I stop a manga for the cheesy romance. But I didn’t see this one as if it was only about the rape. It was disgustingly sexual and that made it so raw I guess. It would’ve been better if it was less around the sex that’s true
solotravel,ff6su0p,t1_ff6657k,1579634163.0,"I left home because I am an anxious mess, non-active suicidal and really wanted to be on an adventure. I traveled not much (only 2 weeks gone atm) and already feel better about myself.

I had the option: pay for a psych or pay for travel. And I chose the travel part. It’s not gonna fix it, but it is gonna help.

I met a psych actually in Berlin who gave me some tips, I met a person here on Malta now who was depressed and overcame it.

Mental health is an issue you can only solve if you want to solve it. And if traveling is gonna motivate you more to wanne be alive: I feel like it could help"
manga,ff6sfwd,t1_ff6caaw,1579633926.0,"It was scary. But a good harsh manga. I liked it, gave me very real emotions. And was actually kinda scary"
insaneparents,ff6j9ok,t1_ff5y46b,1579628390.0,"Thankss, I’ll try. I am traveling around now, away from my mum"
insaneparents,ff6j6f2,t1_ff5yqf8,1579628336.0,Yeah really. You think you are overreacting and the problem. But when you’re out you realise how bad it was
insaneparents,ff6j1pd,t1_ff61n3d,1579628256.0,They don’t hate me. My mums is way to good in manipulating for that. I too thought I had the safest and best home. I laughed at some peoples homes. “Well yeah they don’t yell at you or hit you. But my mum will pick me up anywhere in the middle of the night.” She had us raised right
insaneparents,ff5xjrn,t1_ff5vinv,1579613539.0,"Thank you soo much. I needed to hear that. I can also help them better now, now that I feel better. Cuz I am not that much of a moody/angry person. As I was in that house"
insaneparents,ff5xfux,t1_ff5vx32,1579613446.0,"Thank you!! I was NC for awhile but now close with her. She is learning actually, (my mum)she apoligesed multiple times now!! We think she loves us, but just doesn’t really now how to mum. 

She isn’t physical, only if really angry. And the verbal abuse is way less with my younger siblings.
I try to stay close and do what I felt like I couldn’t do with my older siblings. And that that’s they can always call me. We just felt like overreacting calling someone. Since I had my older brothers playing dad. I think I was better off with him. (Seeing the people I met out of youthhelp)"
insaneparents,ff5s8g1,t1_ff595xh,1579608263.0,I moved out and even tho my mum is softer (especially after I moved out) on my younger siblings. I feel so guilty. So so guilty. Like I am now ruining their lives. And even before that. I felt like I couldn’t leave her alone.
wholesomememes,ff1sfwp,t1_ff1sbqf,1579485158.0,"Cool!!! I get your mum, although I think the Dutch language iz very cute."
wholesomememes,ff1rni6,t1_ff1b7bw,1579484662.0,Owow really? How fun. You speak Dutch too?
wholesomememes,ff19wfy,t1_ff19pc2,1579476676.0,"Yeah I was already looking at the word, thinking there was something wrong. Thanks hahaha! It’s energie in Dutch"
wholesomememes,ff18jwl,t1_ff18c5j,1579476310.0,Yesss!!! If my sister gets too much I just explain to her that I am not in the same energie. She will calm down a bit and understand. Not tell her she is annoying. Energie and enthousiasm shouldn’t be seen as a bad thing
wholesomememes,ff14foo,t1_ff0srxa,1579475117.0,My little sister does it a lot and it’s crazy how many people come up to you to tell you how much energie she has. How: “annoying” and “too much”.
depression,fex7npi,t3_eqqfz6,1579426224.0,"For me it’s just like a little voice. When I am not alone I am having so much fun. I’ll go back home on a cloud, actually feeling awesome!! And it’s like someone whispers: “Hey you aren’t supposed to feel that, remember you want to kill yourself!!”

And it’s just like the cloud just fades. Back to being a gray blob"
TikTokCringe,feszkt6,t1_feltp7f,1579370475.0,Thanks? But I was just asking a question tbh. I wondered why Ted Bundy was seen as such a god by incels
depression_memes,femtlwx,t1_fem6il6,1579269242.0,"That’s really sweet of you. I hope ome day you might be able to live for yourselve. But still. It’s really awesome and selfless that you do that for him.

Proud hugs and keep going <3"
depression_memes,femtifz,t1_felk39x,1579269167.0,"I hate my mum. But if you replace it with my little sister I get fhe feeling. I don’f want her to end up like me: so I’ll live. My living might be unwanted, bit she is the best girl ever put on this earth. And no ones gonna ruin it for her"
anxietymemes,fekjp8q,t1_fekc65x,1579201467.0,I always was super good in dodging the ball. which made me always the last one standing. But I can’t throw!!! So everyone is just laughing and looking at you. (Treffball ofc)
