GirlGamers,ff4avue,t3_ere3tm,1579559344.0,It's so cute and really well designed!
RATS,feo0za8,t3_eq4qe9,1579293599.0,Would love to know how she makes these!
Aquariums,feo0bnf,t3_eq4sd2,1579293425.0,"Oh hey, this looks like my Morpheus! I had no idea what he was called, guess now I do! :D"
aww,fe03d0a,t1_fdzx12m,1578802047.0,"Definitely not; maybe in outliers or really special breeds but the average fancy rat lives 2, 2.5 at best."
aww,fe039dv,t1_fe02h5e,1578801976.0,"I have two rats and a cat. The rats live in their cage and I've yelled at the cat enough that he knows to leave them alone. When they have their play time, I just keep an eye out but have never (thankfully) had an incident. The two can sort-of coexist pretty peacefully!"
aww,fe0368o,t1_fe01jdj,1578801913.0,"About 2 years is right, give or take. And yes, they should always be at least in pairs if not more (although as they age this tends to get harder). We work a normal 8H shit and the rattos tend to sleep during that time (or play or eat or poop or whatever with each other) and then are awake and play with us when we're home. Definitely recommend coming to /r/RATS to learn more about them - they're wonderfully smart and full of personality."
exchristian,fcvk5bz,t3_eiv13o,1578003821.0,"A little behind the curve on this one but it's worth mentioning that many sects of Christianity view sex as not just for pleasure (or at all, depending on who you ask) but as part of the 'be fruitful and multiply' bit. They believe that getting pregnant or not is up to God and that humanity shouldn't interfere - to grow up the next generation of believers is the primary goal here. Thankfully in more modern times, many branches of Christianity recognize that not all couples should have a baby right away (or at all) and that proper family planning is not inherently anti 'god's plan', although there is still very much a culture of 'let's get married just so we can bang' and that certainly contributes to this issue as a whole a bit too. 

Vaccines are different in that they help keep all these children they want to pop out alive (although we have entered a period were it seems nobody trusts them now but that's a conversation for a different day)."

TrollXChromosomes,fcvhfrx,t1_fcvb1zg,1578002160.0,"Yeah seriously, my name is Katie and that was what I was referring to /shrug"
TrollXChromosomes,fcudm9t,t3_eiy4v1,1577978479.0,"As another Katie, I feel the need to balance this absurdity by telling you to wear whatever the fuck you want, girl."
ChicagoSuburbs,fbuh10a,t3_eeik22,1577114255.0,"It's definitely something that happens often, but I guess nobody talks about it. I used to work in an appraisal office where we did mostly tax work for both commercial and residential - depending on the assessment of your house, you could get a pretty decent tax reduction, it's definitely worth looking into."
