army,ffjvsys,t1_ffjv2e5,1580008323.0,What is 20 months from now?
aww,ffjkdbk,t1_ffj71b8,1580000218.0,"Probably going to be downvoted, but whatever. Leaving a dog home alone for 8/9 hours a day isn't that terrible or even uncommon. Most of us work that long. Unless every other dog owner has a walker/sitter/helper/whatever, most of us are hitting that mark. Exercise before and after is crucial, but eight hours is definitely not the worst.

Is it the best thing? Of course not. Is it better than sitting in a shelter? Probably.

You said you don't have time for walks or can't be home every day. I don't know your schedule, I don't assume to either.. I just wouldn't want a dog to not get a loving home for the sole reason that people think eight hours is too long. Dogs sleep. A lot."
galaxys10,ffj4jp7,t1_ffj3qxt,1579990212.0,"Stuff like the Bluetooth icon, alarm clock, nfc, battery, wifi, LTE, etc. I've actually removed a few already. 

I'd like to see the list to see if I can remove the LTE icon when my data is off, but I'd have to see how they're written out."
army,ffj2i0l,t1_ffj0kgn,1579988744.0,"I've read that regulation and it does say that the four hour minimum should be worst case scenario. It heavily implies that commanders should prioritize rest and always make an attempt to give at least eight hours.

I think when it was written, maybe it was trying to do the right thing, but it's just not working out.

I'd like to see something along the lines of:

* the four hour minimum would only apply in a deployment environment or training (like field exercises or NTC, not the whole ""we're always training bullshit"")

* in normal, every day, garrison environments, the duty day will not extend beyond 0630 - 1700. 

* the duty day will not exceed 12 consecutive hours (no, personal hygiene and lunch doesn't break up a duty day. We all know those are a load of crap 70% of the time)

* there will be, at the minimum, a ten hour gap between the end of one duty day and the beginning of the next. Any attempts to dip into this must be approved by... someone high enough up that's it's too annoying to even try

These are just high hopes and I realize they will never happen. I know that missions come down (being in an airborne unit, I'm not unfamiliar with a 0300 showtime), but nothing I wrote above would honestly have an impact on day to day operations.

Mission came down so we have to be in early. Okay, nbd, BN Co approves, just make sure you have your guys out within 12 hours. No more online training that we found out about at 1530 that has to be done by the entire company before tomorrow. No more waiting around until a 1630 formation where we're talked at for an hour. No more conflict between working late because PSG said so and coming in bum fuck early because 1SG said so (PT is important, I get that. But a 0430 show time for a ruck is ridiculous when a bunch of your soldiers got off at 2000 the night before).
 
I genuinely believe that the army as a whole would continue to function if the above were applied. But it won't. Oh whale."
Android,ffj129h,t1_ffemyu5,1579987709.0,"Mildly related question a day later.

I have an S10e (which isn't covered under this as far as I'm aware?) with a cracked screen and cracked back glass.

Going through Verizon insurance, they want to send me a new phone for $199. I won't do this because I've heard awful stories about the phones they send back.

I've also looked at going through uBreakiFix. They will repair both sides for just over $300. Unfortunately, I don't have money like to spare on cell phone repair.

Why can't the screen be repaired on it's own? I don't see the back because it's in a case. I just want my screen fixed. This seems to be impossible to do though, and I don't understand why.

Thanks"
army,ffizayj,t1_ffi76fu,1579986428.0,"Does it actually require test though, or just sleep? I know about the mandated four hours of sleep but, theoretically, a shithead NCO could work you from 0000-2000 every day, non-stop.

I'm only being pedantic because I know *sometimes* the thought of being home for eight hours crosses leaders minds, but not much more than that. And it's only usually in the context of sleep.

You're going to make sure I have eight hours between COB and next work call? Thanks? What about commutes, family, personal time, appointments, errands, etc? There have been countless times where, for weeks (excluding my whole *48* hour weekends!), I would walk in my front door, prep my stuff for work the next day, and then go straight to bed. 

In my mind, there's a difference between rest and ""rest"" as defined in regulations."

Android,ffiqz0w,t3_etc1v5,1579980518.0,"I get what you're saying that it should be a feature on Android, not debating that, just trying to provide solutions.

First thing that comes to mind would be Tasker. I've never built a profile for your specific situation, but I don't imagine it'd be too difficult. Check out /r/Tasker"

galaxys10,ffgvg5b,t1_ffd394z,1579916073.0,"I don't disagree with anything that you're saying, but the pictures that people *are* taking on their phones aren't generally worthy of the cameras. 

People aren't taking professional photos meant to be displayed, printed, or sold. They're taking pictures that are probably never going to leave the digital world and probably won't ever be seen larger than a phone screen.

I really don't think we need the cameras we have right now."
galaxys10,ffgv04y,t3_esvfsl,1579915752.0,"I hate even writing this, but the S10e might be my last Samsung. The size is perfect and there's a headphone jack. I definitely have some complaints, but none that outweigh the size and headphone jack.

Even so, I watch the leaks and the back of the S20 is *ugly*. I get that people take pictures with their phones, but come on. The camera area takes almost 25% of the back. Can you imagine what the case is going to look like? 

In my opinion, I would appreciate a deviation on adding more and more cameras and more of a focus on battery life and this notch mess. I'd rather have a taller screen with an unusable ""forehead"" that houses stuff over a shorter screen, 99.99999% screen to body ratio, and a cutout/notch. 

These are just my thoughts"
aww,fepiej3,t1_fepglgq,1579321291.0,"Not sure why the downvotes, but if the question if genuine, then yes. We all know that dogs have incredible senses of smell, but it's seriously crazy. They can smell cancer, or infection like one poster said. They can sense seizures and anxiety/panic attacks. They're amazing.

Not every dog of course, and sometimes training is required to ""hone in"" on that skill, but it's definitely there.

So yeah, pregnancy would be an easy thing for a dog to know. The protective nature would come down to their personality. It's not unheard for a hyper/crazy/don't understand how big they are dog to immediately calm down and be basically perfect around babies and sick people. If I'm not mistaken, it's the pack mentality. They'd do the same for their pups and I'll/injured."

dogs,fephfmx,t1_fepdl8v,1579320577.0,I've had a bloat scare because we came home and my dogs stomach was massive. I paid $200 for an x-ray of food... But she was about as happy as could be..
