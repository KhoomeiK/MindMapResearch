Think about how he doesn't feel bad at all trying to harass you while you're unconscious and how he blames YOU for not fucking him. I have a bad guilt complex too, so I understand your frustration. Once you make the first step in separation, it'll get easier. Think about how you could be happier and how much better your life will be. Don't do this to yourself."
