AskMen,ffihcbl,t3_etslwk,1579973886.0,"Honestly, I'm not really feeling it today. Been having a great time, on holiday, found out my crush likes me and we had a really nice time yesterday, but not really feeling it.  
Funnily enough, she isn't either, which makes me worry and I'm having to fight myself to not be too clingy and give her some space."
AskMen,ffigu7u,t1_ffi6vdv,1579973546.0,"That's such a great attitude. I'm sorry no one taught you these skills, and I hope you learn (and have learnt) them well, and pass them on."

patientgamers,ffd539f,t3_esuqni,1579813586.0,"I'm glad to hear someone else say they didn't like Bloodborne. So far my experience with Soulsborne games have been Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3, neither of which impressed me much. On paper it's a genre I should love (challenging but fair, smooth and enjoyable combat, the works) but the lack of purpose beyond ""reach the next lamp post/campfire"" kinda bores me after a while... I've been considering Sekiro (when it drops in price) but I've seen a large chunk of the game through youtube already, or Jedi: Fallen Order which which honestly sounds like everything I want a Star Wars game to be."
