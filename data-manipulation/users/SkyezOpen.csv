Main sets are always print to demand, and even then Khans fetches never went below 7 for the cheapest that I saw. 

> it gave some peace of mind to 'investors' in the secondary market

Here's an issue that's popping up now though, LGSs that keep singles stock *are* investors. They crack lots of product to have stuff to sell, and they also buy from players. If someone trades in a bunch of value cards like fetches for store credit, that's a huge boon for the store because they'll sell. If WotC reprints them into the ground, the store is losing out. For example, Secret Lair is straight up printing very desirable cards to demand for a reasonable price. I'm loving it. WotC is loving it. But the stores are the ones eating the shit sandwich.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that game stores live and die by the secondary market. If WotC decided ""hey random packs are dumb, let's sell all cards for $1 each"" there would be nowhere to play magic anymore."
