He had two ""friends"" with him, who, from the way they were acting and positioning themselves were clearly there in capacity of being bodyguards.

Was just me and them in the whole fairly large store, I didnt say anything to them or make any attempt at walking up to him or anything at all like that, and it was just so bizarre the way those two were constantly glancing suspiciously in my direction, tactically positioning themselves to easily block me if I somehow got too close.
