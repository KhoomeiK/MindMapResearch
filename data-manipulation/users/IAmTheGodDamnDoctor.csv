slowcooking,fe5ykcx,t3_enwp0n,1578877816.0,"Recipe:

10 eggs

2 tbsp cream

1 lb potatoes

1/2 lb chopped mushroom

3 green onions

3/4 cup cheese (I used medium cheddar, jack, and colby)

salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne, and onion salt to taste.

Instructions:

First, chop up potatoes and mushrooms. fry them up in a frying pan with a bit of oil and your spices. You want the potatoes just a bit crispy.

Take them off the heat to cool.

While they cool, prep everything else

mix together 10 eggs with your cream using a fork

chop the green onions (use whites and greens) and dump into your eggs

shred your cheese and add to the eggs

Use some sort of spray or oil to slick up your crockpot.

dump in the potatoes and mushroom.

Poor your egg mixture on top and give it a little mix

cook on low for 2.5 hours. I have a very wide, 6.5 qt crockpot. If yours is smaller, you will probably want to do 3 hours to cook all the way through.

cider,fcobks1,t1_fcoacq5,1577828241.0,"Indeed. I definitely have never listened to Missy Elliot. I was 11 when that song came out, and I was definitely more into RuneScape and other videogames at the time. I've never really been big into music"
cider,fco9wy7,t1_fco7y9k,1577827097.0,"I've been using plastic for 4 years and have no issue. I have steel and glass as well, but I don't like using them because they are bulky and heavy. I notice no taste difference between the three fermenters. I haven't met any home Brewers who didn't start with plastic. plus, it's not like I'm aging this for more than a couple months, so it's not too big an issue"
cider,fco6qx2,t1_fco6k3t,1577825142.0,What?
cider,fco0wsd,t1_fcnz9al,1577822097.0,Nope. Just put it upside down and jammed it on. It fit snuggly over the top

slowcooking,fcidi2p,t1_fcichrs,1577660927.0,"I'm honestly not sure. I just kinda do a few shakes of the shaker, but probably about a tsp or so of each. I then go a bit lighter on the onion salt and a bit heavier on the paprika and smoked cayenne because I like heat."
pcmasterrace,fccdryy,t1_fccd1vp,1577597245.0,"Go to a home Depot or similar, buy a small plank, and put your PC on the plank. I did that for a while"

My two PCs have been parted out to build my GF a PC and to make a work PC for my job as a teacher.

TalesFromRetail,fc9eu80,t1_fc8skgj,1577551610.0,"I got my first ""real job"" at Burger King shortly after I turned 18. It was all good. About a year later, we got a new manager, Jill.

One day, Jill pulled me aside and started berating me for never turning in my paperwork and threatened to fire me since she was getting heat about me working there. I was 19 and flabbergasted. I had turned in all my paperwork and had been working for a year. 

Apparently Jill and our DM both thought I was 15 and had been searching for my high school work permits for over a week, but they couldn't find them. They assumed the old manager had just not given a fuck. 

They did all that, bit never once talked to me, looked at my age on my paperwork, or talked to the old manager who had just moved to a different store under the same district manager."
Sacramento,fc7fu6s,t1_fc6hnss,1577506159.0,"I definitely remember a few customers who would do that. Fun fact, we got those crusts in the mail. Like literally delivered by USPS in a vacuum sealed bag in an ice cold box straight from the distributor."
Sacramento,fc7fkke,t1_fc4tuvd,1577505929.0,"So true... I'd love to tell some horror stories about him, but I don't want him coming after me in any capacity"
Sacramento,fc4rirr,t1_fc4qhj9,1577425765.0,It was pretty dope
Sacramento,fc4n3e6,t3_eg5mjl,1577421607.0,"I used to work at hot city pizza in East Sac. I still hang out with the former owner. He has a similar picture of his family. It's great.

That show definitely hits home with a lot of small restaurant owners."
195,fc0z657,t1_fc0yrc7,1577303677.0,"Wait... What's ""moderating"" mean?"
