news,fevu43n,t3_eqec8q,1579401526.0,"The Roman Catholic Church continues to shoot itself in the foot over the self created sex scandal. As mentioned here and at great cost, all VOLUNTEER laity and anyone interacting with a child must sit through classes, pass a background check for which they will need to submit their Social Security Number. Here’s the thing, since most do not trust or believe Church hierarchy is willing to report cases of abuse, a priest will automatically pass a background check unless he was reported and charged. So once again the Roman Catholic Church continues to punish all volunteers by making them submit to standards they do not hold their own employees/priests. It’s an outrage. I’m a Catholic and I’m exhausted and angry at my church. When it seems all scandals are behind us, oopsie, here comes another onslaught."

news,fevp5x2,t3_eqk42v,1579399889.0,"Many districts flat out ignore bullying even though they ironically devote programs to anti bullying! If I didn’t see it play out with my grandchildren who attended (now both in college) school in a wealthy, privileged district, I wouldn’t have believed it. My grandson was racially bullied except during basketball season because he was a great player (yeah, I know that sounds stereotypical). The phrase “nigger get out” was on wall of boys bathroom. No one saw it on the walls. He reported it and it was really no biggie and it took three weeks to get it removed. Again—no big deal I guess. My granddaughter was not permitted to sit at lunch table with some popular girls. When she wouldn’t move, a sweet little monster grabbed her lunch tray and smacked it down at another table—all food went flying. In every instance officials did nothing. These are two mild instances the kids endured. Bad enough the kids were horrible but I expected the adults to be, well, adults, decent. You know—the old phrase “kids will be kids”. That was the excuse given. It’s total bullshit but I guess the kids learned lessons in hypocrisy, how not to treat others and life is tough and don’t expect civility."

politics,felbnaf,t3_epp46h,1579218390.0,"There does not seem to be one human being working for Donald John Trump who isn’t tainted by the scandals unfolding at a furious pace. It does not seem possible, practical or believable that these people are not involved in the latest Ukraine scandal to besmirch VP Biden. Trump et al can call this a witch hunt, but I’m not buying that overused explanation nor are millions of other Americans. Let the Impeachment proceedings unfold. If Trump is exonerated as I think he will be thanks to a gutless Senate, at least there will be a record of serious, historic reproach against a man who does not believe in truth and honor."

ADHD,feff7gy,t3_eoo9bd,1579055049.0,"My guilty pleasure since 1978 has been having a cleaning woman. I was 28 at the time and now I’m almost 70. We had a huge house and we worked, raised kids, I did my own cooking (am a very good) and laundry. She came once a week and cleaned the inside of the house though I wouldn’t call it deep cleaning. Still, it gave us a starting point and it was easy to section off areas to deep clean ourselves. Now the house is sold and my husband is no longer alive. It’s been rough especially when I had the house. I did not need so much room and all that work. Have had quite a few women in 42 years. Shortly after my husband’s death, I found a cleaning service on the advice of friends. What a godsend!  These three women clean everywhere. Pull out dressers and dust behind them. They clean the walls, ceilings, windows, bathrooms from top to bottom. My kitchen and floors sparkle. I love these women. I’m in a small apartment now and don’t need them every month; my place is easy to maintain. So they come every other month, bring their own cleaning supplies, towels, vacuums, dust cloths etc. I wouldn’t be without them."
