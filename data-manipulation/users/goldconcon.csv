AskWomen,fe8zwza,t3_eo11i1,1578932752.0,senior's home. no first hand experience gladly but my friend tells me seriously horrible stories about her experiences working in them.
AskWomen,fe8z8tv,t1_fe8y955,1578932485.0,"i'm not really sure who the mods expect to be here to respond with first hand experience. it's not like the world is full of women who tried and failed to be full time youtubers, it's not something all that many people ever try. dear mods: maybe let other people participate too? otherwise OP probably isn't going to get any answers at all"
TalesFromRetail,fe8xjnq,t3_enyp86,1578932070.0,wow i wish my own mother ever listened to me like that when she was being unreasonable
AskWomen,fe8kpw2,t3_eo3mur,1578927243.0,on the other hand i know there are definitely some women on youtube full time and doing fine. although it seems like you have to get pretty lucky to become big enough for it to matter as a career
tifu,fe8jyph,t3_enook9,1578926997.0,"that is a really weird reaction for someone to have under any normal situation. definitely seems like she was already stressed out about other things and probably even upset at you. you should talk to her and try to understand the real issue, then if it was to do with anything you did apologize and make it right"
AskWomen,fe8jae7,t1_fe6s4o0,1578926743.0,pretty much the same for me. doesn't feel like anything special or really worth celebrating. it'd be nice if other people stopped bothering me about it too
relationship_advice,fe8iig9,t1_fe4ifxp,1578926516.0,"yeah. some people are devious and strategic in how they manipulate a partner or other close person's relationship with them. i bet OP's girlfriend is play acting and is going to unblock and expect him to feel guilty even though he didn't do anything wrong to offend her, just so she can feel validated and in control in the relationship. OP watch out. if or when she talks to you again make sure that you know what to look for and how to spot gaslighting or other kinds of abuse and to not respond to them."
relationship_advice,fe8hjba,t3_enzx6q,1578926204.0,"nobody ever quit an addiction who didn't of themselves want to change. the first step is to make sure he realizes that he has a problem, if he's using reddit so much that it's hurting his relationship wthi his family. then hopefully he will want to change and repair his relationship with you and your kids. but if he doesn't want to change then anything you try to do is only going to push him away and aggrivate him. you might not have any better choice than to just get used to it."
AskReddit,fe8foay,t3_enwojq,1578925650.0,not free and not online but i still suggest a weekend first aid course with red cross. that is really good knowledge to have and there is probably a location near you that's offering courses.
offmychest,fe8f57w,t3_enziwt,1578925505.0,sounds like people in general not just reddit
offmychest,fe8ekt8,t1_fe5r8vy,1578925305.0,"i'm sorry you went through that. i think that sometimes you have to ask yourself if your kindness is being appreciated and repaid, or if you're just humoring people who don't really notice and don't really care. sometimes the answer is to look after yourself and your own health and well being, to don't care about making any special effort for other people, because there is never a guarantee that anybody else is going to do it for you"
offmychest,fe8dqrp,t1_fdesrce,1578925103.0,"isn't that what people are trying to say, ""we're here for you""? when they say ""thoughts and prayers""? maybe they say it a little different because they're religious and that's how they're used to it being said, not because they're automatically thoughtless only because they have a religion"
relationship_advice,fdel804,t3_ekmjqm,1578341391.0,"different people express themselves in different ways. i'm not saying it's not possible that he is really being a jerk, but have you thought about if he's been expressing his affection and gratefulness in other ways besides giving you gifts? that he responded quickly to try to fix the problem when you talked to him and he understood that you were upset he hadn't done more about your birthday, makes me think he might have thought he was making you happy in some other way and to give you gifts just didn't occur to him."
AskReddit,fdejbo6,t1_fddmhlx,1578340242.0,"life might have be a good and lucky for things other than humans but i feel pretty sure that the whole human race is just screwed, difference between you and the most upvoted comments is they dont know it yet"
Tinder,fdeiyn4,t1_fdd1giv,1578340024.0,unsure if human
TalesFromRetail,fdeifbe,t1_fdb5urw,1578339699.0,unbelievable to me when employers and managers expect people to be at work when they're that sick
offmychest,fdehzvl,t1_fde1h28,1578339439.0,what else are they going to do? most of these people don't have the means to help in any better way
Paranormal,fdehaks,t3_ekxbzk,1578339007.0,it never hurt you right? do you think it was evil or benign?
relationship_advice,fdegxb8,t3_eku797,1578338779.0,i would want to know if somebody i knew from online was going through something like this
AskReddit,fb1mwri,t1_faz5t9p,1576438620.0,there's this guy named peter lynds who wrote some stuff about time that made a lot of sense to me although i don't think his ideas are very well accepted
