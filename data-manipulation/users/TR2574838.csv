toastme,fd0fflf,t1_fcxgw4z,1578118032.0,Unfortunately this is one of the reasons I don’t bother to try dating or find someone. I feel like no one will ever tolerate me.
Sat,fcovibu,t3_ei4zyx,1577842710.0,The worst part is I cannot get to 1250. It shouldn’t be that hard and yet every time I take those damn tests my brain turns to mush and I’m stupid as hell.
lonely,fciv1ko,t1_fcgisj1,1577670492.0,"Mine is so bad that I do it all the time. In class, at home, In bed, in the shower, and sometimes I’ll go to my room and close the door just so I can lay down and day dream. It makes me feel so much better. I have entire stories and characters made up in my head. 

I might be crazy but it makes me feel better lol."
depression,fchv3xo,t1_fceml1j,1577654502.0,"It’s not. People care a lot more about looks than anything. 

I mean maybe one day I’ll find someone that can halfway tolerate me lol, but for now I think being alone is the only thing in store for me."
depression,fchumuh,t1_fcf1sjh,1577654337.0,Thank you so much for this.
depression,fchukxh,t1_fcflf4f,1577654316.0,"Thank you :) 

Mine is on the back of my neck and I have one spot on my foot so sometimes I forget I even have it haha."
depression,fchr9vb,t1_fcf4ee5,1577653242.0,I saw your rate me post and youre not ugly at all my friend. I love your hair.
depression,fceboro,t1_fceanjv,1577618990.0,Same here. I’m not overweight but I have a fair share of other problems obviously. I also have vitiligo. Stay strong. It’s good to know I’m not alone.
Vitiligo,fce7c1t,t3_e5bnj9,1577617591.0,"You’re gorgeous 

I’ve had spots on the back of my neck and on my back along with one on my foot lol. It hasn’t spread that much and sometimes I forget about it but recently I was curious and took pictures of the back of my neck and took a look at it for the first time in years. I thought it was awesome!"
depression,fcdt89s,t1_fccdgc1,1577613526.0,"I don’t understand how you think I could be beautiful, but thank you."
unpopularopinion,fc0yjjf,t1_fbys8qq,1577303171.0,"Maybe, but I don’t get any compliments, so when all you’ve gotten is people making fun of you for things like that, it hurts. 

But the guy who pointed out my chin hair and laughed at me is really just like that. He makes fun of everyone. I guess I shouldn’t have been so surprised lol."
