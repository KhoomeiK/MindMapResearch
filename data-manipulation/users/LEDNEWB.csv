I.e.
11/29/19 chatted with maria from amazon customer support she filed something for the promotions request

11/30/19 recieved an email telling me I needed to contact amd

11/30/19 contacted amd and they sent me a copy of their promotional policies explaining this was something I needed to contact amazon about 

Then I started a new chat with Amazon and very nicely started the convo off with the giant list of things I had done; I told them I just wanted to catch them up and I apologized for the long message.

I also included a link to the ryzen 9 3950x amazon page(where the promotion is listed)
And a link to the amd sites promotion page with the name of the promotion.

All in all it was a super long message because I had called amazon support like 3 times, chatted with them 6 times, received like 4 emails, contacted amd 3 times(they were much more consistent than amazon)

And literally only had to send it once, I recieved an email within 24hrs from amazon with the promotional code (I didnt get the 3 months xbox game pass, however I didnt really want it)
But I'm sure if I reached out they would supply it

I'm a firm believer in being nice to customer support, so as daunting as that sounds to send to them a huge message (because it seems like you're being aggressive) I repeatedly told them to take their time and not to rush and thanked them for their help."
