Pontiac had already failed when I bought the car, and the warranty was included with the sticker price at the dealership.

BernieSanders,fej0cb1,t1_feixt2p,1579152412.0,"Well, I suppose we're talking about two different things. I should've stated that Bernie is in favor of free education for all. Elizabeth Warren is in favor of ""affordable"" tuition.. Look, this isn't semantics. ""Affordable education"" is subjective. Free education is not subjective. I feel (maybe it's a little philosophical) that the U.S. has reached a point where we should all be extremely educated. If we want to reinforce the narative that we're ""the greatest country in the world"" free education should be priority one. The trickle down effect works for this idea. Free education creates more doctors, lawyers, professors, engineers, and if people dig the blue collar lifestyle more plumbers, construction workers, mechanics.... 

You probably get the point.

BernieSanders,feizm3j,t1_feiyzgv,1579151756.0,Very well said.
BernieSanders,feiwwn3,t3_epe998,1579149449.0,"In my humble opinion, Elizabeth Warren would handle conflict far differently than Bernie. Bernie is a strict non-interventionist. Also, Bernie is seeking to make college tuition free as well as eliminating all student debt... How? He has laid out his plan of taxing Wall Street speculation You can see his website for details. I actually believe it can work. The student debt bubble will eventually pop, and it all lands on the government anyways because they own the majority of the student debt to begin with. This will put hundreds, if not thousands of dollars back into working people's pocket who actually need it. In turn, this money will increase spending in the market. People will be able to buy goods and services more easily; homes more easily, cars more easily. This stabilizes our economy. 

Warren has similar ideas, but they seem less likely to see fruition. 
Also, until about 15 years ago she was a registered Republican."
