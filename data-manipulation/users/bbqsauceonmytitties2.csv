unpopularopinion,ffher7r,t3_etjccq,1579932220.0,"I mean things have been pretty rough lately for me. Yet I’m still going to appointments, okay the VA didn’t help me, I found an off base doctor I’m waiting for it to be approved. Oh this treatment didn’t work, I’ll try this one. It’s exhausting. It seems like no matter what I try or do my mental health declines again but I’m still looking for answers. It’s draining and some days seems hopeless. I hate when people tell me to just think positive because I’m trying but I doubt anyone in my situation would just be positive. I have some major shit going on."

unpopularopinion,ffgggrd,t1_fffpd9r,1579905682.0,Which is bullshit and I’m sorry for you. I grew up with a girl who has OCD. Also super unorganized. People don’t understand what OCD really is. I don’t fully understand. I know it’s not being neat and clean. It’s actually pretty complex and seems difficult to live with. It’s not cute or trendy. I have bipolar and PTSD and so I deal with stereotypes too. It’s bs. Everybody gangster until it’s time to go treatment or spend some time in the ward.

Every personality is different. There are are cultural differences as well. There are so many ways to handle a situation and so many ways to raise a child. You can raise a child one way and have to do something totally different for his brother. You can’t learn that in a parenting class.

unpopularopinion,ffe5997,t3_esw8xp,1579837045.0,"So, when I got out of the military my husband suggested I make my dog an ESA since I struggle with PTSD and another mental illness. 

Here’s the thing, my dog will never be well trained enough to be service dog. Never. She had a hard time comprehending simple commands. We hired professionals to work with her. We tried different methods. She just didn’t get it. Very sweet dog. Very submissive, but just can’t understand commands. She’s very timid and seems to be really reactive to my emotions. 

I like taking her places. When I can, I do. But when I’m experiencing a panic attack she’s just there. Sometimes me freaking out causes her to freak out. Sometimes I misunderstand something as a threat when it’s not, therefore she does too. That’s not helpful. I am more calm when I have her, but I am in therapy learning ways to cope with my PTSD on my own for now. If I need a service dog done the road then I’ll get one trained properly and go through all the proper steps. ESAs really don’t help when shit hits the fan.

unpopularopinion,ffdqcti,t1_ffcovtz,1579826414.0,Male cats can be. They’re susceptible to upper urinary tract disease. My cat has it. He blocked. That was extremely expensive to treat. Now he’s on special food for life. He gets frequent UTIs. We have to make sure he’s constantly calm. He has meds he needs. He’s been to the vet a ton. I went four years with him with not a single issue then he blocked. It’s just something to keep in mind when adopting male cats because it is fairly common.

JudgeJudy,ff9k4ii,t1_ff8zz1f,1579714703.0,I thought someone found it on YouTube
AirForce,ff9k28t,t1_ff91z6e,1579714667.0,"I get OPs point. I still disagree. Thank you. I think my personal experience actually adds to the situation. If someone is considering suicide over small stressors then they have no ability to cope with stress and need to be taught how.  That’s not small. Telling someone not to sweat the small stuff when they’re suicidal isn’t effective, therefore the two messages don’t belong together. Nothing will change my mind on this."
AirForce,ff8i9q0,t1_ff8cz2h,1579679720.0,Okay cool. Thank you.
AirForce,ff8bnvf,t1_ff8bcpj,1579672048.0,"I’m sorry, I just don’t agree that the two messages should be mixed. Maybe that’s personal experience coming into play so I feel some type of way. 

I agree. The small stuff is magnified in the AF. I don’t miss that. My husband who is a typically chill guy comes home irritated over something that was made into a bigger thing than it needed to be. I feel for him being in that environment still. I don’t disagree that the small stuff should be brushed off. I just don’t think suicide belongs in that same conversation. I get what you’re saying. I guess I just don’t agree."
AirForce,ff89xim,t3_es6oto,1579670380.0,What do I do if I’m out now but I need it? Can’t get on my pay.
AirForce,ff89duf,t1_ff61ysb,1579669867.0,When I was at goodfellow everyone went to PT
AirForce,ff891wr,t1_ff7mnny,1579669572.0,"If you can’t PT test or deploy for an extended amount of time, that’s when they consider MEB. Typically it’s a year, sometimes it’s longer. I have more experience with mental stuff, but I do know some people got MEB for physical after a certain amount of failed surgeries as well."
AirForce,ff88nqj,t1_ff87yx0,1579669217.0,"Not that little of stress. If forgetting a belt stresses someone out to the point they end it, something deeper is going on. 

Stress isn’t the only thing that leads to suicide nor does stress mean someone will consider it. For me, my attempt and ideation a really boil down to hopelessness.  Trying to recover from something major such as, an abusive relationship, addiction, trauma. That feeling that I can’t recover or escape does it for me. For some it’s deep depression they can’t see an end to. Or someone close to them passing away. There’s a lot of reasons. Forgetting a belt isn’t one of them. Not independently. 

I get it. Good point. Don’t sweat the small stuff. But don’t sweat the small stuff and don’t commit suicide don’t belong in the same conversation. Small stuff isn’t the cause of suicide and suicide isn’t small stuff."
AirForce,ff864yc,t1_ff82nci,1579667062.0,"I get that, OP could have said that without mentioning suicide. Idk why OP had to mention suicide because what he’s saying has nothing to do with suicide."
AirForce,ff861ax,t3_es4nng,1579666979.0,I don’t know what forgetting a belt has to do with suicide. I don’t think anyone is suicidal about that.

offmychest,ff4nfw5,t3_erhisj,1579567868.0,It’s not a these days problem. People have always cheated.
NewMomStuff,ff2h6ys,t3_er941q,1579505976.0,"No, I feel the exact same way. Don’t feel like you have to be excited because other people tell you you should. Parenting is scary. But just know you can do it. It’s okay not to be excited because this isn’t something that you thought you’d do. Maybe something else excites you. Others feel the same as you. You’re not a bad person."
pregnant,ff2frs3,t1_ff2d151,1579504262.0,He told me to try harder to form friendships.
BipolarReddit,ff21r6b,t1_ff1yeji,1579491464.0,I think a break may be what I need. My husband is really not supportive of that. I’m in a women’s group that the VA. I’d have to pay out of pocket if I go out in the community. If I want tricare to pay for it they pick the place and maybe even the doctor. My plan is to see what the odds of getting a new therapist in the VA is like and what my options are. If not I’m going to go on the dependent side (ugh I hate that word) as my husband is active duty. The problem with that is it’s hard to get weekly meetings there or even twice a month because they’re sooo full on the active duty side. I’m gonna call both on Tuesday and figure out who can help me.
pregnant,ff1xg3s,t1_ff1tlid,1579488390.0,I don’t know. I know two of the wives. They’re cool. There is one wife I don’t get along with. I think most all of his work friends are single tbh. Also I don’t wanna be with people who aren’t my people. My people live far away. I want to celebrate with them. I can’t. It’s better to just not have one at all. I don’t want people to show up because they feel obligated or sorry for me.
BipolarReddit,ff1c6wk,t1_ff1bdjc,1579477402.0,No. I’m not excited about being a mom. Another life I can’t take care of. Another thing I’ll fail at.
BipolarReddit,ff1a1pk,t1_ff18gsc,1579476728.0,I’m pregnant. I do what I can. Yoga. I don’t think my diet is going to solve my problems. I feel like I’m not being understood or validated right now.
BipolarReddit,ff110xz,t1_ff0lh2g,1579474176.0,I came to this sub for a reason.
BipolarReddit,ff0vbty,t1_ff0lh2g,1579472642.0,I’m on medication. I have a therapist we just aren’t connecting.  I miss having friends. I feel like everything has gone to shit and nobody cares I’m doing everything to fix it.
pregnant,fezxbs2,t1_fezwulk,1579462900.0,Unfortunately I live all the way in Hawaii so nobody can travel. It would be three people at my shower so I’m just not having one.
pregnant,fezx5x0,t1_feyl400,1579462833.0,I don’t have a social network. I just got out of the military but stayed where I was stationed because my husband is still here. Everyone left. I’m not around family. I’m in therapy but it’s through the VA so it’s not the best quality. I’ll have to suck it up. Not much I can do. I don’t see an issue with not being excited. Not everyone is.
pregnant,fezkjoa,t1_feyl400,1579458281.0,I don’t see it the same way I guess. I’m sorry you find it rude. I don’t see it that way.
pregnant,fewnyuq,t3_eqoi6d,1579416383.0,I have one. I love it and apparently the pets do too.
pregnant,fewnfbh,t1_fep7vkb,1579415701.0,I mean I actually don’t like when people automatically congratulate me and assume I’m excited because I’m not.
marriageadvice,fenxoep,t1_fenniyp,1579292358.0,He does this all the time though.
marriageadvice,fenlj9t,t1_fenl99y,1579287264.0,He doesn’t think it’s an issue. He’s still active duty and in one false move from calling his chain of command but I don’t want to ruin his career. He’s successfully painted himself as an honest charming guy and me as a crazy person because I’ve come to grips with my mental health diagnoses and seek help. I don’t know how well I’d be supported by anyone on his end because he’s successfully convinced them and everyone else I’m crazy.
marriageadvice,fenl0ai,t1_fendtyc,1579286940.0,No he does the drinking often. It was an issue before o got pregnant. Yes I get the hormones are a thing but I’m tired of that being brought up. It’s not why I’m upset.
marriageadvice,fenkvn8,t1_fenffwf,1579286863.0,Why would I give an alcoholic a baby? He can’t even take care of himself. I wasn’t even lashing out. I just calmly confronted him and realized he was still drunk. He drank from roughly 8pm to 5 am which this is definitely not the first time. That’s unacceptable and he’s no more fit to parent than I am. He’s lazy. I’m so done.
marriageadvice,fenkpz7,t1_fengwn6,1579286766.0,I’m sorry I’m just a wreck and feel misunderstood
marriageadvice,fenkox2,t1_fene2g8,1579286748.0,He won’t leave. I’m at the VA talking to my therapist she’s looking for the social worker now to see if there’s options for me.
marriageadvice,fen9sra,t1_fen98d1,1579280076.0,So how am I supposed to leave? With this kid on my own? You suggest that but do you understand the logistics behind that? Also how is him constantly yelling at me tied to my sexual assaults? I know you’re trying to help but I don’t feel like I’m being understood right now. I’m going to talk to my counselor but that’s not going to fix him. That’s only addressing me.
pregnant,fem7mhr,t3_emaulr,1579242666.0,I caught a sinus infection while pregnant. I had to go to the doc. It got really bad.

pregnant,fem7d7n,t3_emak6z,1579242394.0,Fuuuuuck that. If the baby came you’d have told them. That’s annoying
pregnant,fem10m0,t3_emej7l,1579236280.0,"I’m sad I’m just now reading this. I’m 27 and feel so similar. I’m a veteran with sexual assault related PTSD. I felt like everyone expected me to be excited when I wasn’t. I obviously just got out of the AirForce my life wasn’t together yet. My husband was elated but I have another mental illness along with ptsd. I’m a student trying to become a substance abuse counselor. I had plans and ideas. I wanted my mental health to be more stable before I had a kid. 

I was extremely depressed until this week starting school. I’m still irritable and angry. I was kind of quick to anger and working on it before but it’s gotten unmanageable at times since getting pregnant. Until 14 weeks I was having severe morning sickness all day and night. I was hospitalized three times. Twice for physical things and once for psychological reasons. I can understand this. Hormones are a bitch but having people touch you and examine you when you’re a survivor of sexual trauma is the worst. It is going to trigger things. If you can seek therapy please do. It’s helping me a  lot. I’m here if you need."

Veterans,feeeioa,t3_eohuki,1579032109.0,"I’m sorry, I have to kind of correct you. Yes, you’re right not only military service causes PTSD. I have PTSD from multiple sexual assaults and rapes. Abusive childhoods can cause it. Car accidents, natural disasters yes. 

Stress isn’t trauma. Starting a new job isn’t trauma. It’s stress. There’s certain criteria  used to diagnose PTSD that kinda distinguishes PTSD from just stress. If we put everything in the category of trauma when it’s not, it invalidates the experiences of those who have truly experienced trauma. I may get downvoted, but I’m correct. Stress and trauma are different."

I am using all my resources and nothing is helping. It’s been months.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdskl6h,t3_emhl14,1578704363.0,"PTSD can be caused by essentially any event where you were afraid for your life or the life of someone close to you. So car accident, war, rape, natural disasters, shootings or anything of the sort.

They’re all about mental illness until shit gets real and it’s time to go to the psych ward, then they’re suddenly better. When it’s time to learn coping techniques, they’re suddenly okay. Having a mental illness means therapy and meds. Means trips to the ward sometimes. Means rehab sometimes but they aren’t on board with any one that.

unpopularopinion,ffdqcti,t1_ffcovtz,1579826414.0,Male cats can be. Theyâ€™re susceptible to upper urinary tract disease. My cat has it. He blocked. That was extremely expensive to treat. Now heâ€™s on special food for life. He gets frequent UTIs. We have to make sure heâ€™s constantly calm. He has meds he needs. Heâ€™s been to the vet a ton. I went four years with him with not a single issue then he blocked. Itâ€™s just something to keep in mind when adopting male cats because it is fairly common.

AirForce,ff9k28t,t1_ff91z6e,1579714667.0,"I get OPs point. I still disagree. Thank you. I think my personal experience actually adds to the situation. If someone is considering suicide over small stressors then they have no ability to cope with stress and need to be taught how.  Thatâ€™s not small. Telling someone not to sweat the small stuff when theyâ€™re suicidal isnâ€™t effective, therefore the two messages donâ€™t belong together. Nothing will change my mind on this."

AirForce,ff8bnvf,t1_ff8bcpj,1579672048.0,"Iâ€™m sorry, I just donâ€™t agree that the two messages should be mixed. Maybe thatâ€™s personal experience coming into play so I feel some type of way. 

I agree. The small stuff is magnified in the AF. I donâ€™t miss that. My husband who is a typically chill guy comes home irritated over something that was made into a bigger thing than it needed to be. I feel for him being in that environment still. I donâ€™t disagree that the small stuff should be brushed off. I just donâ€™t think suicide belongs in that same conversation. I get what youâ€™re saying. I guess I just donâ€™t agree."

AirForce,ff88nqj,t1_ff87yx0,1579669217.0,"Not that little of stress. If forgetting a belt stresses someone out to the point they end it, something deeper is going on. 

Stress isnâ€™t the only thing that leads to suicide nor does stress mean someone will consider it. For me, my attempt and ideation a really boil down to hopelessness.  Trying to recover from something major such as, an abusive relationship, addiction, trauma. That feeling that I canâ€™t recover or escape does it for me. For some itâ€™s deep depression they canâ€™t see an end to. Or someone close to them passing away. Thereâ€™s a lot of reasons. Forgetting a belt isnâ€™t one of them. Not independently. 

I get it. Good point. Donâ€™t sweat the small stuff. But donâ€™t sweat the small stuff and donâ€™t commit suicide donâ€™t belong in the same conversation. Small stuff isnâ€™t the cause of suicide and suicide isnâ€™t small stuff."

BipolarReddit,ff21r6b,t1_ff1yeji,1579491464.0,I think a break may be what I need. My husband is really not supportive of that. Iâ€™m in a womenâ€™s group that the VA. Iâ€™d have to pay out of pocket if I go out in the community. If I want tricare to pay for it they pick the place and maybe even the doctor. My plan is to see what the odds of getting a new therapist in the VA is like and what my options are. If not Iâ€™m going to go on the dependent side (ugh I hate that word) as my husband is active duty. The problem with that is itâ€™s hard to get weekly meetings there or even twice a month because theyâ€™re sooo full on the active duty side. Iâ€™m gonna call both on Tuesday and figure out who can help me.

Heâ€™s still active duty and in one false move from calling his chain of command but I donâ€™t want to ruin his career. Heâ€™s successfully painted himself as an honest charming guy and me as a crazy person because Iâ€™ve come to grips with my mental health diagnoses and seek help. I donâ€™t know how well Iâ€™d be supported by anyone on his end because heâ€™s successfully convinced them and everyone else Iâ€™m crazy.
marriageadvice,fenl0ai,t1_fendtyc,1579286940.0,No he does the drinking often. It was an issue before o got pregnant. Yes I get the hormones are a thing but Iâ€™m tired of that being brought up. Itâ€™s not why Iâ€™m upset.

Thatâ€™s unacceptable and heâ€™s no more fit to parent than I am. Heâ€™s lazy. Iâ€™m so done.

Iâ€™m going to talk to my counselor but thatâ€™s not going to fix him. Thatâ€™s only addressing me.

I felt like everyone expected me to be excited when I wasnâ€™t. I obviously just got out of the AirForce my life wasnâ€™t together yet. My husband was elated but I have another mental illness along with ptsd. Iâ€™m a student trying to become a substance abuse counselor. I had plans and ideas. I wanted my mental health to be more stable before I had a kid. 

I was extremely depressed until this week starting school. Iâ€™m still irritable and angry. I was kind of quick to anger and working on it before but itâ€™s gotten unmanageable at times since getting pregnant. Until 14 weeks I was having severe morning sickness all day and night. I was hospitalized three times. Twice for physical things and once for psychological reasons. I can understand this. Hormones are a bitch but having people touch you and examine you when youâ€™re a survivor of sexual trauma is the worst. It is going to trigger things. If you can seek therapy please do. Itâ€™s helping me a  lot. Iâ€™m here if you need."

Stress isnâ€™t trauma. Starting a new job isnâ€™t trauma. Itâ€™s stress. Thereâ€™s certain criteria  used to diagnose PTSD that kinda distinguishes PTSD from just stress. If we put everything in the category of trauma when itâ€™s not, it invalidates the experiences of those who have truly experienced trauma. I may get downvoted, but Iâ€™m correct. Stress and trauma are different."

Theyâ€™re all about mental illness until shit gets real and itâ€™s time to go to the psych ward, then theyâ€™re suddenly better. When itâ€™s time to learn coping techniques, theyâ€™re suddenly okay.
