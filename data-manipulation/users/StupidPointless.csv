There problem is, nobody is working 1000 times harder than I am. I work 50-60 hours a week (with no overtime because I'm a ""expempt"" from overtime laws, so already working harder doesn't equate to more money) in a cognitively challenging job that requires at least a master's degree to be successful at. Why is someone making my yearly salary every few minutes? Jeff Bezos didn't work that much harder than me, he was smart, sure, but he also got lucky. Bill Gates is definitely a lot smarter than I am, but should his net worth be 1.1 million times more than my net worth? (I did do the math). That is saying that I would have to work for 1.1 million times of my current professional life to have as much as Bill Gates. Working at this level for millions of years without overtime pay? That seems excessive.

Also, I believe that we have a fundamental obligation to help people in need. If you don't want to help people who are sick, poor, struggling, then you're not just a bad person, you're a bad American."
