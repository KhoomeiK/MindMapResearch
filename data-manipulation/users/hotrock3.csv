The guy who does it now also includes a poster size print when you buy the batch of photos."
AskPhotography,ff5yq57,t3_eruq21,1579614535.0,"Making side money as a photographer while teaching is 100% possible. What kind of photography and how hard you want to chase that goal will determine how you go about it. 

I started out by just taking photos of bikes and cars at the racetrack on my weekends. It brought in $50-100 per track day I went to once I got a display and sales system set up. 

Photography is still ""a side gig"" for me because I can't rely on it for consistency but it makes up nearly 30% of my income."

AskPhotography,fedpzm6,t1_fedmq99,1579017378.0,Part of the advantage of the EOS R/RP is that you have access to all of the EF lenses now but also the future mirrorless designed lenses. This means you have a huge selection of affordable but still good used lenses now and can upgrade later if you want/need.

DAKAR,fecb36n,t1_fe53k9r,1578969933.0," The highlights from last year show several instances of other trucks stopping to help pull someone out from being stuck in the sand or righting a rolled truck. 

In addition to the ""we are all trying to finish"" mentality there is a lot of ""its you this time but it will be me stuck next time."" Some of the older Dakars showed this to be true, a couple times in the 80s some of the truck team A didn't stop to help team B out of being stuck only for truck A to get stuck a little bit later at which point trucks B and C said, fuckit you staying there. The only two times I saw this was when team A was a Soviet team and team B was not. Bare in mind this could have happened more but the Soviets were ""the bad guys."" Such behavior fizzled out for the most part.

Although you can see another truck go by the Japanese team it is likely there is one of the support trucks not far behind and they knew that. I also think that last year had a lot more more tip overs and trucks getting stuck so it wasn't like the support trucks could do it all where they likely can here."

DAKAR,fe6kvii,t1_fdcdfc0,1578894270.0,"The route is known to the organizers and they do have their own media crew who is aware of the routes. Last year someone put out a video showing what it was like to work media for the Dakar and they had a complete map for the day.

I think you are confusing public knowledge of the race coarse with private knowledge. We can be absolutely sure that Dakar, KSA, and their insurance companies know the course very well.

I understand they cannot cover 500-900km like a F1 race but even last year the coverage was way better than it is now. This year it seems the only people getting highlighted are the pro racers, sort of, and the privateers just get ignored unless they steer their SSV with wrench and screwdriver.

A perfect example is when Paulo replaced his engine to finish stage three but yet there was little if any mention of it until after his death. They had the video, why not throw it in the recap? Last year the car and SSV highlights showcased person after person getting stuck and digging out, this year is just full throttle flat out for 90%."
dubai,fe63n3y,t1_fe62hh5,1578881049.0,"That same estimate was mentioned in the video and article and is attributed to ""other studies,"" not data collected through practice.

motorcycles,fe5zf60,t1_fe4wsa2,1578878355.0,"I've heard a lot of people mention that they just aren't really enjoying Dakar this year as a fan. I include myself in this group and I think it has a lot to do with the quality of coverage this year. Redbull isn't putting out their typical quality or quantity of content, the highlights from Dakar aren't as emotionally engaging as last year, and I'm having a hard time finding other content to watch. 

My guess is that with the change in location it's thrown a wrench into the production of content and I hope it improves next year. I can't really think of why else the content isn't there. The course looks great, the competitors seem to be giving it lots of praise, and it seems to be taking just as massive of a toll on the competitors as usual in terms of mechanical and navigational challenge."
