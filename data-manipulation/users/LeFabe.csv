politics,ffh2sn3,t3_eti8eu,1579921571.0,Her interview with him was infuriating. Why didn’t they include this bit in the actual interview they aired. This administration is full of assholes and NPR somehow keeps reporting on them like they’re regular people.

surfing,fcohyge,t1_fco7chu,1577832664.0,Everyone seems to think these are closeouts. I don’t get it. If you took off in the right spot you got plenty of shoulder.
