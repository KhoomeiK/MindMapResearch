The_Mueller,ff3ypz6,t1_ff3tqp3,1579551766.0,"Thanks! They were a project I did for a print club I'm in. Nerdy print info incoming:

These were printed using a 1960's Vandercook SP-15 printing press and hand-set metal type - if I'm recalling correctly that's 36 point Modern Gothic (or maybe Franklin Gothic Condensed). It's hard to see in the picture but the typeface is pretty beaten up so there's lots of little scratches and imperfections. 

I've since learned that OP saw these on twitter and this picture has been making the rounds for a while. Makes me all warm and tingly inside :)"
