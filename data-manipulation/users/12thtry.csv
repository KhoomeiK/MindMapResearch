Most people thought it wouldn't work on the pro level. For his first couple of seasons, he played behind Demarco Murray, who was a top rusher with the Cowboys before continuing to be a top rusher for the Titans. when Demarco retired/moved on, Dion Lewis entered the picture and then he was the featured back in that scheme. Finally, towards the end of last year, Henry was given a chance to do full time what he had done occasionally all along: run over dudes for 50-70 yds at a time, once in a while.

oaklandraiders,fcvmyey,t3_ej2orf,1578005570.0,Last seen on TB's practice squad. Anthony Rush has been back and forth between Philly's practice squad and their active roster. I liked both those guys and would be happy to have us give them another look.
oaklandraiders,fcv7737,t1_fcv6hn5,1577996067.0,"that wold be hysterical, but interferes with the whole symmetry of the tuck rule happening over again, but going the other way. Maxx Crosby takes the ball and Brady's entire right arm in the snow and runs the whole bloody package in for a TD, thus restoring balance to the Force."
oaklandraiders,fcv70th,t1_fcv47db,1577995963.0,"no, that's exactly my point when I say be careful what you wish for.


also, not ""your"" sub anymore than mine."
oaklandraiders,fcv49or,t1_fcun7r2,1577994338.0,"I don't want Alex Smith. I want to keep what we have, for now. The real point of my post is for all those folks that are so eager to move on - have you really given any thought of what that might look like? Because it might fuckin look like Alex Smith."
oaklandraiders,fcv3bad,t1_fcujgez,1577993774.0,I agree completely. Never been a fan. But look at what Gruden likes - veterans who are familiar with a west coast system - he's the most logical choice based on those criteria. I vote we stand pat for now.
