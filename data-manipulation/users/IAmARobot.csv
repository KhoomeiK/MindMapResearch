sydney,ff3j6k2,t3_erbxq9,1579542178.0,"I ""got out of it"" 3 times within like a year until they said I had to do it. I had the same compelling work-related reason each time but you get put back onto the potential summons list. So anyway when I showed up the 4th time I had to hang around until after lunch and then they told me to fuck off home, and having been shortlisted then I'm not back on the roll for another two years (3 years grace after you've 'served'). My advice is to get there early. The queues are long through the scanner and the later you go, the more annoyed the desk staff gets (in my experience).  

I say ""got out of it"" because I don't really mind either way if I have to do jury duty, but at that point work *reallly* needed me as opposed to ""eh they can do without me for a few weeks""."

australia,fecyzmq,t1_fecisuf,1578990510.0,"In nsw, I have to have compulsory third party insurance to get my rego. I dont have comprehensive car insurance because it is literally half the value of my car. In the 3 years I have not paid comprehensive insurance, I have made back the value of my car so I can just put it into buying another car or fixing my current if someone puts me out. If I hit someone else or are at fault in some way then it's covered by my ctp and my rates go up accordingly. Even today I saved myself and three other cars a few thousand dollars by seeing something stupid about to happen, so I slowed down in my lane without braking and avoided a merging fuckup by two other people all while I had someone tailgating me. One day I'll be unlucky but sure as shit it won't be my fault. So the gamble is an easy one: I bet on myself not to be a shit driver.
