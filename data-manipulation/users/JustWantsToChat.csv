*If* they made a statement condemning the Venezuelan gold farmers specifically, they can't do that anymore.  Obviously they won't make a statement supporting them either, that would be silly as well as create an expectation for Jagex to get more involved.

This is where I'm stuck.  If fate doesn't need to be changed for Narancia to die, does Diavolo consciously need to kill him in KC time?  If so, does that imply he can move within that window?  Then it seems really similar to The World though so I think I'm off base.

Or is it more of a, As far as history is concerned, Diavolo did kill Narancia, but Diavolo himself skipped over that part.  It still ""happened"" but in a paradoxical, universe correcting itself kinda way?

Diavolo uses Epitaph to see what path fate is taking.  Then with King Crimson, he can time it so that he erases everything up to when he can do something to change fate.  Fate had already dictated that Narancia would die there, so Diavolo skipped ahead and did nothing, thus Narancia died.

If Diavolo used Epitaph and saw that Narancia was not fated to die, then he'd have to actually kill him and not just let ""fate"" do it.  Am I close?"
