All your information is stored there. So no need to go to a branch or call them if you have one.

Currently, there are two ways to have it.

&#x200B;

1) As an OFW

2) Loyalty Card Plus

&#x200B;

The number 2 option can be done by going to a PAGIBIG branch. There's a boot there for this. Just prepare two valid IDs and make sure you're an active PAGIBIG member. You also have to pay 125. This is a one day process."
