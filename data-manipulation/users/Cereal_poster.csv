It can malfunction, not being able what it is supposed to do. What is one of the purposes of the brain? Right, to think, to judge, to act. A mental illness, a malfunctioning brain can make this impossible. The affected person doesn´t choose this, it cannot control this. Therefore the person is not at fault for it. Depression is caused by brain chemistry going wrong, the brain doesn´t work anymore like it should be.

@OPs friend, since you are likely to read this thread here: We know that you  lie about your financial situation. We just don´t know which way you lie. Either you lie to your friend and pretend being broke, which makes you a piece of shit, or you are broke and pretend wealth to everyone else, which makes you incredibly stupid.

But that should simply mean, that she can sell one of her expensive gifts (like her shoes) and pay OP for the ipad. When you spend that much money on expensive stuff, you can also sell it again to get some money back for the really important things, like paying OP for the stuff the kids broke."

I think this way should be that she learns about the impact of bullying and how the victims feel. See if there is any anti-bullying program in your area she can attend, where she is confronted with the pain that bullying causes. Or let her do some charitable work where she has to help other people. If she does this and shows that she is capable of compassion and understands how and why she did wrong, THEN you can end the punishment and sanctions. 

I am not a huge fan of ""Punishment without any right to parole"" because this will not really teach her the lesson she needs to learn. She will only see herself as a victim now (which she isn´t but she will see it differently).
Show her a way out of punishment, but she really has to earn it by confrontation with victims of bullying and to see the impact of her action. Make her a better person, not an even angrier teenager."

AmItheAsshole,fdndylg,t1_fdncyzc,1578583758.0,"You do realize that ""feeling"" is different from ""knowing""? They do not know if they get paid less. The thing is: In Austria we do have, what is called ""Kollektivvertrag"" which is a union contract which determines the minimum wages for many different fields of work. IT has its own contract too and within this contract there are different categories, dependent on years of working experience and the different field of work. 

So a dev will have a different category than an office assistant. These minimum wages are not the kind of wages where you would say ""that´s insanely low"". It really is a good wage, so you can be sure that they do (just as me too) get paid these wages (plus additional bonus every year). But it really boils down to negotiation skills (I know that, because I suck at it too). Gender wage gap surely is a thing and it MIGHT be a thing here too, but we (and they) simply don´t know it, as we are all very secretive about wages here.

I never negated that women suffer from sexual assault or harassement in their personal lives and it is bad that this happens. As an individual one can only see to respect and treat women equally and right. And I have never done anything else. (and PLEASE do not twist my words into ""that´s what you think you did, but maybe the women you dealt with see it differently"", as I can see that happen.)"

But when it comes to general treatment by the male colleagues they do not see any form of discrimination in everyday work life. 

I am not sure about the wage gap, it could be a thing (and I think it is bad, because in my opinion same work - same wage simply applies) but that might be because of negotiation skills and not because of the gender itself."

AmItheAsshole,fdlg61i,t1_fdlfsv5,1578523314.0,After some of the other replies here I really hope that I do not suffer from a misconception and it really is like this in my workplace. I have deep respect for our female devs and the other female folks and simply like them (like my male colleagues). I really hope I never mistreat them unknowingly.
AmItheAsshole,fdktwti,t1_fdksfsj,1578511075.0,"As mentioned in the other answer: I get your point. I will simply ask them tomorrow. You DO have a point there about the ""getting defensive"" and ""getting offended"" here and I see how I proved you right in this. 

Even though I do not think that I would react like this to them (I mean we are internet strangers here, but I consider my colleagues as friends, since we know each other for a very long time and talk about a lot of personal stuff on a daily basis) as I did here."
AmItheAsshole,fdktfpv,t1_fdkrme1,1578510787.0,"Ok, I see what you mean. Lets just make it like this: I will ask my colleagues (at least two of them, who work at my office) about this. This will still be some anecdotal evidence (as I will not have asked all of them, but lets face it: Questioning all my female colleagues for the sake of reddit might then be a little bit too much, even for our working place). 


The reason WHY I am assuming that we don´t have the problem mentioned is, because they DO complain about other stuff and I see no reason for them (they are strong, self conscious, respected women) to hold back when it comes to these issues. But as I said, I will ask them tomorrow when being back at work."

AmItheAsshole,fdknyz0,t1_fdkdomu,1578507531.0,"and where did I do that??? You are just assuming things without knowing ANYTHING about my workplace, you might not even know the country I live in. (my posting history will give you that information though). Where did I dismiss that these things exist? I only said that I do not think it exists in MY workplace. Plus YOU are generalizing without knowing anything about me, my female colleagues, how we treat each other. Oh and what might even really set you off now: Just imagine: I even hugged one of my female coworkers today. (don’t worry, it was just a happy new year hug and she started it). So am I an abusive harassing monster because of that? Better call HR about it. The thing is: when you work with people for 10+ years and more as I do, when you can absolutely open talk about any issues (and we really do that) then you do get an idea what the working environment is like. And my colleagues really tell when things go wrong or we do something that they don’t like. And then we try to set them straight. We are grown people and act like that.

It really ticks me off that you are judging me or our working environment just because it is bad at other places. I KNOW things are bad at other places, I am not blind. You accuse me of generalizing and in fact do the very same yourself."

It is an off label use, but that stuff really helps slowing down bowel movement and making life with reduced small intenstines easier. Just be aware that this is an opioid though and therefore has an addiction potential. I always like to tell people with similar problems about this, as many docs simply don´t consider it because they don´t know about the potential of it. It´s off label use (usually it is used against cough) but works like a charm (at least for me).

It would never cross the mind of anyone to expect one of them to provide cake or anything because they are female. tbh, they don´t get treated in any way different than the guys here.


If we have cake or someone brings food to the office, it´s from one of us men and women who simply love to cook and/or bake (I´m a guy and love to cook, but suck at baking) and likes to share it with the colleagues. It happens once in a while, that when I make a big portion of lasagna, I just bring the rest of it to the office the next day, since I know that some of my colleagues love my lasagna. And is there a better compliment for a cook than people loving your food? 

I think if anyone would go up to one of my female coworkers (even those not working in the technical field) and tell them ""well, you as a woman should provide cake"" all of them would straight laugh at this persons face because it is a totally insane assumption that she would have to do that for being female."

AmItheAsshole,fdx2bo4,t3_en6jau,1578764598.0,"NTA. She has to face the consuences of her action. BUT I would suggest to give her a way out of punishment. I think this way should be that she learns about the impact of bullying and how the victims feel. See if there is any anti-bullying program in your area she can attend, where she is confronted with the pain that bullying causes. Or let her do some charitable work where she has to help other people. If she does this and shows that she is capable of compassion and understands how and why she did wrong, THEN you can end the punishment and sanctions. 

I am not a huge fan of ""Punishment without any right to parole"" because this will not really teach her the lesson she needs to learn. She will only see herself as a victim now (which she isnÂ´t but she will see it differently).
Show her a way out of punishment, but she really has to earn it by confrontation with victims of bullying and to see the impact of her action. Make her a better person, not an even angrier teenager."

Taking time off is great, but from what I figure, you are career driven and actually enjoy your work and obviously are great in it. So I really hope that you will be able to get back into a new, not hostile working enviroment where you can remain healthy AND enjoy working together with great people. But all of this because you WANT to and not because you have to. 

All the best to you. You do have a tough time ahead of you, because working on your mental health and traumas will likely be very exhausting and challenging but I am sure that it is worth it to face your demons of the past and being able to conquer them."

AmItheAsshole,fdndylg,t1_fdncyzc,1578583758.0,"You do realize that ""feeling"" is different from ""knowing""? They do not know if they get paid less. The thing is: In Austria we do have, what is called ""Kollektivvertrag"" which is a union contract which determines the minimum wages for many different fields of work. IT has its own contract too and within this contract there are different categories, dependent on years of working experience and the different field of work. 

So a dev will have a different category than an office assistant. These minimum wages are not the kind of wages where you would say ""thatÂ´s insanely low"". It really is a good wage, so you can be sure that they do (just as me too) get paid these wages (plus additional bonus every year). But it really boils down to negotiation skills (I know that, because I suck at it too). Gender wage gap surely is a thing and it MIGHT be a thing here too, but we (and they) simply donÂ´t know it, as we are all very secretive about wages here.

I never negated that women suffer from sexual assault or harassement in their personal lives and it is bad that this happens. As an individual one can only see to respect and treat women equally and right. And I have never done anything else. (and PLEASE do not twist my words into ""thatÂ´s what you think you did, but maybe the women you dealt with see it differently"", as I can see that happen.)"
AmItheAsshole,fdn5ngd,t1_fdkrme1,1578577966.0,"Ok. So I asked them about it today. Basically they confirmed my view with an exception: They do think that it is likely that women are paid less in our company. But they do not really know that for sure (thing is: here in Austria, nobody openly talks about how much he/she is earning, so I really have no clue how much my collagues earn). But when it comes to general treatment by the male colleagues they do not see any form of discrimination in everyday work life. 

I am not sure about the wage gap, it could be a thing (and I think it is bad, because in my opinion same work - same wage simply applies) but that might be because of negotiation skills and not because of the gender itself."
AmItheAsshole,fdliyhq,t1_fdlho2z,1578525048.0,"Genderneutral language is such a huge thing here in Austria (mostly in academics though) but really, I have never met a woman here that doesnÂ´t think it is totally weird to read/hear. 


The whole ""itÂ´s all the others fault"" reminds me of a former friend of mine who was jumping between jobs all the time. With like 5 different employers within 2 years and ALL the time it was the employers fault and they were the bad guys. I believed it for the first two times, but after his 10th different job within a few years, I figured what the single point of failure must have been.

AmItheAsshole,fdktfpv,t1_fdkrme1,1578510787.0,"Ok, I see what you mean. Lets just make it like this: I will ask my colleagues (at least two of them, who work at my office) about this.

The reason WHY I am assuming that we donÂ´t have the problem mentioned is, because they DO complain about other stuff and I see no reason for them (they are strong, self conscious, respected women) to hold back when it comes to these issues.

Plus YOU are generalizing without knowing anything about me, my female colleagues, how we treat each other. Oh and what might even really set you off now: Just imagine: I even hugged one of my female coworkers today. (donâ€™t worry, it was just a happy new year hug and she started it). So am I an abusive harassing monster because of that? Better call HR about it. The thing is: when you work with people for 10+ years and more as I do, when you can absolutely open talk about any issues (and we really do that) then you do get an idea what the working environment is like. And my colleagues really tell when things go wrong or we do something that they donâ€™t like. And then we try to set them straight. We are grown people and act like that.

It really ticks me off that you are judging me or our working environment just because it is bad at other places. I KNOW things are bad at other places, I am not blind. You accuse me of generalizing and in fact do the very same yourself."

If you suffer from permanent diarrhea from your removal, please ask your doctor for Codeine. It is an off label use, but that stuff really helps slowing down bowel movement and making life with reduced small intenstines easier. Just be aware that this is an opioid though and therefore has an addiction potential. I always like to tell people with similar problems about this, as many docs simply donÂ´t consider it because they donÂ´t know about the potential of it. ItÂ´s off label use (usually it is used against cough) but works like a charm (at least for me). You situation might be different though of course, but still you might ask a doc about it and give it a try if he/she says itÂ´s ok.

AmItheAsshole,fdjk1df,t1_fdiemyr,1578474474.0,"I work in IT and we have some female software devs and consultants too. It would never cross the mind of anyone to expect one of them to provide cake or anything because they are female. tbh, they donÂ´t get treated in any way different than the guys here.


If we have cake or someone brings food to the office, itÂ´s from one of us men and women who simply love to cook and/or bake (IÂ´m a guy and love to cook, but suck at baking) and likes to share it with the colleagues. It happens once in a while, that when I make a big portion of lasagna, I just bring the rest of it to the office the next day, since I know that some of my colleagues love my lasagna. And is there a better compliment for a cook than people loving your food? 

I think if anyone would go up to one of my female coworkers (even those not working in the technical field) and tell them ""well, you as a woman should provide cake"" all of them would straight laugh at this persons face because it is a totally insane assumption that she would have to do that for being female."
