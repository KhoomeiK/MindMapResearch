I feel like if these people had some mysterious vial of blood that could lead to a cure for cancer their labs would have been mysteriously ""broken into by vandals"" who also happened to steal all of the blood.

DeepRockGalactic,fes8x9b,t1_fes66sq,1579362669.0,I used to play a lot of those and I think you're right. Also it might just be coincidence but it feels like whenever some famous youtuber makes a deep rock video we get an influx of assholes. I've found the joy of playing haz threes now. I actually find their difficulty level not much easier than haz fives as half the time you're playing with a team full of greenbeards. I'm also convinced there are the same amount of enemies in haz three just with less health so to me it feels just as fun

DeepRockGalactic,febc5y5,t1_febbql9,1578957366.0,You might be right but imo I feel like it might provide a quick bit of quick slapstick relief if someone's mad rather than them spamming the chat with insults which I think is worse

I like the system how it is because it feels sort of like gambling, will my OC be a pile of shit? Who knows? It makes it even better when you actually get a good one after receiving five shitty ones I a row. It's nothing mind-blowing anyway. Pretty much all I use it for is not getting fall damage if there's no engie around, but most of the time that's not a big deal anyway. I find it mostly just wastes ammo and leaves me needing to reload it in the heat of battle. 90% of the time you can reach the same areas just by moving a few feet closer.

I think if they overhauled the overclocks so they were all equally good then your way would maybe be better, but right now if they did that everyone would just buy the same five overclocks and ignore the rest"

Look how popular Minecraft is, does it have any goals? Other than crafting stuff I don't really think so. I feel like the Devs should focus on adding ways for players to express themselves and experiment more with the environment rather than just adding new weapons or awards.

I feel one advantage it has is if you're being surrounded you can quickly pop off about four shots in different directions, whereas with the nade launcher you only really get one chance, so you're relying on them all being clustered together which doesn't always happen. I do think the overclocks need a huge rework though. Personally think yaw man is completely useless with such a slow rate of fire.
