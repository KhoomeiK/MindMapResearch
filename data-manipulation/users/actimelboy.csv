offmychest,fc4cpiq,t1_fc4cjp0,1577412866.0,"ah ok, i understand where youre coming from now. thank you all for taking the time to explain"
offmychest,fc4brro,t1_fc4bcv4,1577412104.0,"yes i agree femininity is widely considered a bad thing if youre a man, but i dont understand how that affects women?"
offmychest,fc4as01,t1_fc4a06h,1577411297.0,"sorry im not taking personal offence, i wish i could better articulate my point. i feel you might be misinterpreting what im saying and maybe ive misinterpreted OPs original post.

i suppose how can we know and understand the live experience of another gender.

just to clarify the 'bad people' comment i made, i wasnt necessarily talking about the people in OPs story rather people in general.  I think maybe ive mixed up my comments on OPs experience and my own feelings about these issues in general, sorry.

Also please could you explain your last sentence?"
offmychest,fc49ow6,t1_fc49ddb,1577410432.0,"and im sorry to hear that, but id also like to point out that im a man and i experience belittling from women when i express an interest in feminine things.

i completely agree with OP that this is a big issue and i understand the impact it has on you.

im just trying to pose the arguement that maybe the issue is not 'men', its bad people who in this case happen to be male"
offmychest,fc47i1m,t1_fc43pgm,1577408702.0,"im sorry im not sure i understand that but i respect your views.

in my opinion i would say that it is more acceptable for women to be masculine than it is for men to be feminine, and that this maybe makes it quite difficult in society for feminine men such as myself.

its interesting how we both perceive that masculinity is more widely accepted but we interpret this in different ways.

im sorry if my initial comment came across badly, i do genuinely want to understand your point of view"
offmychest,fc46wb0,t1_fc3hi0t,1577408239.0,"doesnt this just make you as bad as the men you criticise. do you really want to stoop to their level

this just proves that women are capable of that exact same headspace as the men in OPs post. however, most women dont behave like this, just as most men dont behave like this.

gender issues are all based on massive generalisations from both sides"
offmychest,fc46evk,t3_efxe7a,1577407862.0,"while i agree that some men can be annoying and condescending, and understand that i have never experienced the things you describe as i am male, i wonder if actually the underlying issue here is that some people are just dicks, whether they are men or women or whatever, and when we experience dickheads of the opposite gender we often misinterprit that as negativity towards our gender.

in response to your car oil example, my dads friends would be amazed if i could change my cars oil, and im a guy. actually i think the majority of people couldnt do that, regardless of gender, so maybe this does make you smart.

i dont know my pc specs. i think knowing that demonstrates an above average understanding of computers and therefore probably does make you smart. its not smart because its a male hobby, its smart because it genuinely is clever.

i wonder if maybe you underestimate your own intelligence?  in your post the person being most condescending of you is yourself, by judging your understanding as basic.  it all depends on how you respond to peoples comments. these comments you've received are not far of compliments, maybe you should take them as compliments.

i mean no offence in saying this and i appreciate the difficulties women face in society, but i wonder if i genuinely complimented you on something whether you would write it off as a sarcastic insult simply because a man said it?"
offmychest,fc43a4c,t1_fc3to2y,1577405500.0,"i mean, being considered feminine is rarely an insult if you're a woman."
House,fa01z93,t1_f9ypbrv,1575747946.0,no problem!
