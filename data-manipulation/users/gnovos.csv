I've officially lost all my money.  the money I had saved during my ""keto budgeting"".  I'm here to tell you that budgets do not work.  Well, sometimes they do.  Let me explain.  The budget itself was successful.  I gained over 100 dollars!  BUT here's how I did it: extreme financial restriction, under $9.00 a day.  Obsessive counting of spending (pennies, checks, credit cards etc.). Obsessing over the growing balance by recording the numbers in my bank account daily.  Not being able to work while on this budget.  Not being able to buy expensive drugs on this budget.  And in case you are asking yourself, ""what kind of fucked up budget is this?"" ... it's called Ideal Cash.

So after reading all of this... can you really blame me for losing all my money again?  Do I blame myself for losing everything I saved?  That's a really tough question and one I have been beating myself up over for months now.

\****************************************************

So no I will go back to the whole ""budgets don't work thing"".  They don't work because the majority of the time, people end up losing their money again (yep I sure did).  Why?  Because I restricted myself for nearly 11 months and basically put my finances into poverty mode.  I wasn't allowed to spend.  I wasn't allowed to spend on specific items and entire categories of thing.  So isn't is natural to assume that once I was done the budget, my lifestyle craved and craved the things that I had been restricting?"
