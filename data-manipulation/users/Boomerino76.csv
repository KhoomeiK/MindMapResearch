running,fft5fgh,t3_ev3q0i,1580208073.0,"You are sooo amazing! I am trully impressed!!! Keep it up like this!!! There is great inner power that urges you to change your life for the better. Don't lose it, listen to your body. I myself started almost 7 yrs ago, that was very hard but now I enjoy a very different life. It was sooo worth it!!! I am no expert but my beginnings were only fast-paced walks before I tried to run a bit. Gradually I followed my body and let myself run more and more:) Now I can't imagine my life without running! All the best to you in your striving for a better existance! It won't be wasted time, I promise;) Be brave, be strong, be a rock!!!"
