A person's qualifications represent that the person has spent time studying and thinking about something, and, in the case of a PhD, that the person has made a contribution that experts have found worthy.

But a person can spend time studying and thinking about something without a qualification.

And, as for other experts finding your thought worthy, science doesn't work on consensus. All throughout history the overwhelming majority of experts on a matter have believed something to be the case that was not the case, and thought people to be right who were wrong. There are many examples, but really they are popular culture, so I won't bore you by laying them out.

So, someone can have as great qualifications as can be and still be wrong. They can even be wrong about exactly the thing they have specialised in. 

And someone can have no qualifications at all, but still be correct about scientific matters.

Amir says qualifications matter when it comes to science. But that's not really the case."

The arguments for freedom of speech have been given many times by people much more eloquent than me, so I won't bother. Except a short summary of how some of the arguments might apply to Nazis today.

1. If expressing views deemed to be too Nazi is banned, then our anti-Nazi views will become dogma, never having to face any counter-arguments. This would actually make it much easier for Nazi views to  gain popularity at a later date.

2. What if Nazis aren't so bad after all? If we simply kill all those with views we believe to be very dangerous things can get messy fast. Many of the views popular today would have been considered very dangerous in the past.

Yes, dismissing people's lives defaults to being a bad idea. You might sometimes be able to think of a reason why it is justified in a specific case. But unless you can present such an argument it seems like you're presenting views which are immoral."
pics,fd6ynvz,t1_fd6w4fn,1578197348.0,"It sounds like your making an argument something along the lines of the paradox of tolerance (""The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant.""). 

So, your position, as I take it, is that because we would value the lives of Nazis, we would risk them coming into power.

This seems like a consequentialist argument. It says that Nazi lives have no value because Nazis tend to kill a lot of people.

This doesn't seem to make sense at an abstract level: if the argument was correct shouldn't we still value their lives, but end them only sadly to avoid an even worse event?

But at a less abstract level it is equally nonsensical, for this reason: Extreme intolerence of the far-right wouldn't actually harm them. If it came to violence do you think the right or the left would win? If it didn't come to violence do you think it would help the left or the right? In reality, the right thrives off of whatever they can frame as their persecution or as left-immorality. Feeding them fuel would not help things. And when it comes to violence the left does not have the advantage."
