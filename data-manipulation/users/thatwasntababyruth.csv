Or if everyone's Beatles records had become unplayable when MJ purchased the distribution rights. Or what if when the DeWalt brand was sold off all of the old model tools stopped functioning? All of these sound ridiculous because they are physical products, but its less far fetched as software eats the world.

I know a lot of rural events like dressage shows often work by having competitors supply a blank check at the start so they can sign up for events through the day without needing to pay for each individually (personally, I don't think that's acceptable system in any way, but that's how it be)."

cyberpunkgame,fehrnhq,t1_fegyddd,1579122516.0,"On the other hand, a cityscape offers optimization opportunities. In the wild west, you need to be rendering lots of dynamic foliage and plantlife constantly, whereas most things in a city that aren't people are very static and stay in one position.

Games,fegrqou,t1_feggz40,1579101000.0,"I think it's very different from either, simply because it has a deceivingly compact game world. Minecraft and NMS are both built around ""what if you could go anywhere, as far as you want?"". Subnautica goes the opposite direction and is more of a lovingly crafted world, with a way smaller scope. You get to know the environment and the biomes much better since it's all statically placed instead of completely random. 

That's not to say it feels small though, the verticality of an ocean opens up huge opportunities as to what can be done with a smaller space. My point is that its not the kind of game where you can stripmine a location and move on.

Personally I much prefer the crafting system too. In Minecraft they only introduced a recipe book in the last few years I think, and it has everything in it from the get go. Subnautica ties most blueprints to exploration, so the more you explore the more things you can make. It gives a better feeling of accomplishment when building something for the first time."

In the OP scenario, a bedroom down the hall isn't getting heated by the fireplace because its so far away, but the warm air that might be in that bedroom already will be moved towards the fireplace to feed the fire, leaving the room to pull in external cold air.

Also, no we are not bounded to what genes want, and they don't drive anything after birth. They are a blueprint, not a living thing.
