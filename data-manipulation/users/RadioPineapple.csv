What needs to be done is explain things to them in a way that they can understand without becoming thr ""angry libtard meme"".

As an example I was once argueing with a very old, very religious man. He was totally against gay rights, but 100% for free speach. In the end I managed to run his argument against gay pride parades dry, he was forced to conceded when I used free speech as the basis for the argument that it should be allowed.

I find the key is to match their energy durring the debate, if you are too riled up they view you as crazy, but if you are ""too calm"" it can be viewed as lack of conviction or you straight up won't beable to get a word in.

Some classes were just straight up dropped by the time I got to highschool, less fieldtrips, extracurriculars had their price shoot up.
