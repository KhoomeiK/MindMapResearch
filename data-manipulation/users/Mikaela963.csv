BeginnerPhotoCritique,ff4955q,t1_ff46d4o,1579558250.0,That’s what I love about it!<3
BeginnerPhotoCritique,ff467xe,t1_ff45tqt,1579556434.0,"I personally don’t mind it because I feel it’s a reflection of her personality, which really adds a lot more to the photo."
college,ff1q0iq,t1_ff1mg3f,1579483625.0,I’ll definitely see about doing that and maybe having a print out or something I can give them with some information on what to do. Yeah I’m that kind of person lol.
college,ff1khc1,t1_ff0h0ml,1579480642.0,"I mean I’m not looking for any sort of special treatment because of it. As in I don’t need any accommodations just the professor to be aware so they don’t panic or anything, as well as for everyone’s safety."
college,ff1k9os,t1_ff1aysq,1579480536.0,That’s what I’m looking to do is just make sure they don’t freak out and to make sure they know how to handle it for everyone’s safety.
college,ff1k1y2,t1_ff0w48c,1579480435.0,"My thought process behind it is ensuring they don’t freak out and have no idea what to do if it happens or call an ambulance when I don’t need one, also so that way I have a lesser chance of getting hurt. Also Wouldn’t you be freaked out if a student just stood up and dropped to the floor? Lol."

college,fdtsdi1,t3_emr95v,1578721453.0,I am so sorry. Honestly all I can say is immediately get into therapy to help work through everything. If you feel as though a break might be best then maybe hold off for a semester and then see how you feel after some therapy and time away.
gamemusic,fdbm5pl,t1_fd8pp0o,1578258726.0,YES! Thank you so much!
gamemusic,fd7fin1,t1_fd6shpp,1578203668.0,It was very similar but it was a piano I could’ve sworn it was a piano instead of what sounds like a flute in that one.
Teachers,faje170,t1_faj3g8a,1576133509.0,Wouldn’t they need to be certified to teach the other subject? Like if I were to major in English education and took the praxis for that would I need to take that test for the other subject I was going to teach?
