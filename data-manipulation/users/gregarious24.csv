Jeopardy,ffd9qto,t1_ffc3xwk,1579816206.0,"You're very welcome! 

That 50's/60's era of What's My Line was *way* before my time, but it's probably my favorite game show, alongside modern-day Jeopardy. John Daly, the host, was every bit as likable as Trebek is, and their mystery guest segment provided so many gems. 

Everybody who was anybody made an appearance on that show at some point: people like Eleanor Roosevelt, Walt Disney, Alfred Hitchcock, John Wayne, Salvador Dali... and these are just off the top of my head. Soooo many big names - and [it's all on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=whats+my+line+mystery+guest), should you ever wanna watch."

Jeopardy,feel2j9,t3_eop9sc,1579035924.0,"Here's something:

1) Visit http://jeoparty.io/ on your PC, where you'll be assigned a session ID. Keep this window open.

2) Grab your mobile device, go to jeoparty.io and enter in that very same session ID. 

3) From there on, you can either play solo or against anyone who has the ID (there's no AI, unfortunately). 

4) You'll use your mobile device to choose categories/dollar amounts, buzz in, and type out responses.

It is far from perfect, but it's closer to real-life Jeopardy than any other version that I'm aware of (aside from the earlier games you referenced). 

And if anyone out there reading this has a game going, please reply with your session ID so we can join you."

Jeopardy,fdyqz5j,t3_en9uhf,1578782700.0,"That video reminded me (1) how much Ken has improved his buzzer timing since then, and (2) the questions in the GOAT tournament are significantly more esoteric than any ToC.

Look, I'm guilty of having ragged on Brad a lot this week, but it's not at all meant to be disrespectful. All 3 of these guys have earned their spot on the stage. They are, collectively, the greatest of all-time.

But if James or Ken were floundering as much as Brad has thus far, I'd be ragging on them too. However, those guys have risen to the occasion while Brad has not. It doesn't take away from his past performances in the slightest, but I do think it's worthy of ribbing in the context of this tournament."
