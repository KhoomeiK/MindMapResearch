You first post a source of a voluntary survey of less then .001% of the population from the census bureau, then you post the root site to the IRS individual statistical tables by size of adjusted gross income (my original post data site) as if you where trying to make my point for me, and the ""*1.9 kids is the average household amount*"", let me use the same crappy census voluntary survey that uses less then .001% of the population that you like so much  [https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/families/households.html](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/families/households.html) (I used the Historical Households Tables \~ HH-6. Average Population Per Household and Family: 1940 to Present \~ used year 2018 to stay consistent, unlike some) All households portion 2018 all ages 2.53 people per household. Family households all ages 2018 3.14 per household, under 18 per family household part is 0.87... so it's actually 0.87 kids is the average household amount not 1.9 (again where you getting your shitty data the**deuce**545)

The link you posted is to a **VOLUNTARY SURVEY** that the United States Census Bureau sends out to the general population to update similar information collected once every 10 years through the decennial census. I will assume that each household that responded has 2 people working in it and that they told the truth... so from the most current sample size of 127,586 households (all races category) that is 127,586 x 2 = 255,172 people.

(average cost just to have a baby in the US is $10,000)  The cost of raising a child today is **$233,610** – excluding the cost of college – for a middle-income family, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. SO... (6 kids x $10,000) + (6 kids x $233,610) = $1,461,660 just to get have them all and get them all to the age of 18... SO the family needs to make $81,203 ($1,461,660 / 18) a year just for the kids and nothing else. I know no one that makes more then 60k a year working 60+ hours a week...

And why the hell is there a 7 on the little one?!?!

Edit: since most of you are focusing on the ""$60k a year"" part of this, here is some information on that (this is the internet and I know if I don't spoon feed it to you, you'll never fact check it yourself, stupid internet warriors)...  [https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2018](https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2018)  <------- the source (money) : I fall into the 74.6% of American workers that make less then 60K a year category. In fact I fall into the  52.5% of American workers that don't even make $35K in a year. I do know quite a few people, and I also know that people tend to never interact/socialize outside of their income levels (how often do you see people with 6 figure incomes riding the bus?). If you work a $15/hour job and work 60 hours a week for a year including time in a half pay for over time at 40 hours you will still only make $52,500 a year ( ($15 x 2,000hours ) + ($22.5 x 1,000hours) = $52,500) and I never see those people because they are always working. From the original part of the post only 15.7% of Americans make over the $80,000 in a year and could afford all those kids. Having kids in America almost always boils down to if you can afford them or not...
