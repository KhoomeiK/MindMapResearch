fatlogic,ffixv5l,t1_ffi3s7e,1579985387.0,I believe what they’re trying to say is that people are too dumb/lazy to calculate their BMR and TDEE online and then restrict themselves accordingly.
fatlogic,ffix3zl,t1_ffil552,1579984844.0,"You see, I need to teach myself how to do this. I panic if I eat just 100 cals over and then restrict about 500 the next day, despite eating underneath my BMR most days."

fatlogic,fdyz458,t1_fdyn4h0,1578785029.0,"In my experience, clothes sizes for women are all over the place. I may be a size 4 in Target, a size 8 in Gap, and a size 6 at Old Navy. Now my dress size is small, but my shirt size is usually a medium due to my shoulders and bust and my pant sizes can range from medium to extra large due to my hips and thighs. 

And then add that awkward moment where a size 18+ sis is asking. Oh my lord, help my soul"

As for what he is, he and his brothers are all vampire-demon hybrids. Their father is Satan, and their mother is a vampire princess named Selene. Shadows is the strongest, tallest, and most fearsome of his brothers, therefore he is the leader."

creepy,fcwnzen,t3_ehzm96,1578031159.0,Oops. Australia killed Dracula’s wife. Looks like they only got a year to repent before he raises his army to destroy humanity again.

fatlogic,fc6aepk,t1_fc4yk9r,1577475974.0,"My sister called me crazy for counting calories. Her reasoning? “It’s an unhealthy mindset.” 

And she also said I was “starving myself.” I’ve just been eating when I’m hungry and stopping when I’m not hungry anymore. 

My parents are overweight, and she’s on track becoming like them just because she couldn’t handle managing her daily energetic intake."
