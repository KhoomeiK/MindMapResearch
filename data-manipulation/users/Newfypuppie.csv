policydebate,feblcpf,t3_eocjjy,1578960002.0,"1nr has one job.

Take one arg and make the 1ar spend four minutes answering it out of fear typically I do this through three methods
 

When I run DA’s
Uncontroversial new impact scenarios, turns case args(the more the better), and boosting link and uniqueness story while also 3 pointing any of their answers they read in the 2ar. Start with author indite(our card is more qualified etc) warrant indite(this argument is flaw because...), and nuance(we control the story because...).

For counter plans it’s a similar style of reading solves case and solves better args adding new planks if needed while also three pointing their answers

For k you need to overview, answer perm, and read as many k tricks as possible new impact cards are always good too

In other words the 1NR is the most offensive speech in debate don’t let people fool you by saying the 1NR is a throwaway speech for pedantic case args and defense. Because it is the most prepared speech in debate having 2nc prep, 2nc speech and 2nc cx to prepare it should be the best speech in the round and it should blow debates out of the water. Case debate is better spent in the 2nc where they usually have extra time after going for their main offense . Being fast helps so you can get through a lot of cards I’m at 15-20 cards depending on how warmed up I am

college,fclc6s8,t1_fcl7q8j,1577744438.0,"That’s still not correct for on, I don’t think you understand what non profit means in the American context there are no shareholders which means there’s no incentive for a school to make more money via tuition. the president of the school usually has to get their salary approved by a board of directors which usually includes faculty members.


Part of the reason why tuition is so high is that professor salary has to be high to be competitive with the private sector otherwise they would go to to private sectors for work this is especially true for famous professors. Additionally, universities have to increase their prestige via research and as a result have to hire many grad students which is also expensive. Also universities increasingly market themselves to potential students to up their applications and get more competitive applicants to increase prestige things like a new rec center or better cafeterias are more expensive but they gets students to apply. 

So no tuitions costs are not going up cause every universities is owned by money grubbing bastards but instead due to many different changing circumstance in regard to how people apply to uni and how prestige acts as the main incentive for them"
