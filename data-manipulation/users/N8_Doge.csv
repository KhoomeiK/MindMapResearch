worldnews,fffqxaz,t1_fffjkcf,1579889864.0,"Whack conspiracy theory? Really? Are we talking about the same country here? The country that started out this pandemic by arresting journalists and citizens reporting/posting about the flu. The country that has been actively suppressing information and knowingly falsifying the number of sick. The country with a long history of falsifying statistics, murdering its own citizens, suppressing information, experimenting on its citizens, developing biological warfare, and allowing pathogens to escape from numerous other research facilities? Again, I will give my friendly recommendation that you remove your head from your anus. But do it slowly, it seems it is lodged pretty far up there."
