bujo,ffazq15,t3_escrsb,1579748249.0,This is absolutely amazing.  I'm going to see if I can do something similar for my flashy fighter!  Might be time for some gold pens.  :)  (Character's noble house colors are blue and gold.)
CozyPlaces,ffayxvw,t3_esij7n,1579747725.0,"This looks great!  I'm so envious of your bit of brick.  There's a fire escape shelf that I've wanted for years, but I feel like it would only look right on a bit of brick."
crochetpatterns,ff9nt26,t3_eqqppe,1579716876.0,"Here's a video for [hearts](https://youtu.be/cHqOBv5Wpos).

Here's a pattern for an adorable [flower pot](https://www.sewrella.com/crochet-flower-pot/), which you could attach hearts to or adjust the colors to pink/red/white.

Full disclosure though: I haven't actually worked either of these yet.  These are just things I've saved for later.  But hopefully they'll be useful for you!"
bulletjournal,ff2olax,t3_er4btn,1579516553.0,"That's a fantastic use of space, and it looks great!"
GoldenSun,ff2o5n3,t3_er98ry,1579515886.0,"US!  But despite living in a large metropolitan area, I've only met a handful of people who even know about it.  Most of them didn't finish the first game, if they played at all.  The only reason I knew about DD was because my mom saw it in a Target flyer - I never heard about it from anybody else.  :("
GoldenSun,fenilj3,t1_femnrfg,1579285476.0,"You don't have to transfer items to use them, at least I don't think so.  Granted, it's been several years since my last playthrough."
AskReddit,felosaz,t3_epotgk,1579227287.0,"Occasionally I drink and play really loud music (in headphones usually, so I don't bother the neighbors).  Usually I just wallow and browse the internet for hours until sleep.

I'm trying to be better.  I took up crochet again, which means that I have to focus on my hands.  I have shows or podcasts on in the background.  The crochet is actually more helpful because it's a meditative combination of focus and mindlessness.

I'm also (as said in other comments) going to try and establish myself as a regular at certain spots.  Easier said than done sometimes, but the more someone sees you, the more they're likely to talk to you (and vice versa).

I wish you the best of luck!"
Weddingsunder10k,feljgd6,t1_fekld2y,1579223641.0,"Thank you so much for saying this!  This never occurred to me, even though my family has a long history with a local center.  Not sure my SO will go for it, but I'm thrilled to have it as an option."
AskReddit,felckbb,t1_fel4zod,1579218994.0,"Most fences I've encountered have gaps to see through, as they're frequently meant to mark boundaries, not obscure vision."
SASSWitches,felbvv6,t1_fel737e,1579218547.0,"Depending on your thought process, I'd avoid turning on the faucets if you're not filling something up.  From a symbolic level, the draining would be a major negative if you're viewing the water positively.  Not sure what your intention was, but I thought I'd put it out there just in case."
bulletjournal,fektfhj,t3_epgvwy,1579207234.0,I like your color choices!
BroomClosetWitch,fek4ihc,t3_epl5m4,1579192439.0,My jaw dropped.  This is amazing and I want a reason to do this.
AskReddit,fdnzvsh,t1_fdmhcyt,1578596233.0,"I don't remember playing anywhere other than my room except on rare occasions for crafting/puzzles.  Really made it feel like the rest of the house didn't belong to me, despite many of the cleaning chores falling to me.  I love my parents but yeesh sometimes I get so mad at their past choices."
CozyPlaces,fdnsty6,t1_fdmted1,1578592133.0,I worked in a library.  I immediately want to shelve and edge the books until it all looks orderly again.  This pic stresses me out.
AskReddit,fdm5ep0,t1_fdktgjr,1578540220.0,"Kids' shows helped me a lot during my most recent stretch of depression.  I get so tired of all these adult shows with violence, drama, and just awful people, but kid shows let me believe that things will be okay and that nothing is insurmountable."
AskReddit,fdm506q,t1_fdkhomw,1578539941.0,"Laser Tag.  Lots of hiding and sneaking, and an easier sell to most people I imagine."
AskReddit,fdm4mlk,t1_fdk76u1,1578539678.0,"I used to do this around my SO all the time, and even coerced him into joining me.  Every once in a while, the skip makes a reappearance.  Maybe it's time to teach my son to skip... :D"
AskReddit,fdm469u,t1_fdlhpqf,1578539374.0,"That's such a good idea.  I did it recently in a clearance rack, but usually stay clear of thrift stores because it's a pain to search through."
AskReddit,fdhtoqh,t1_fdhhmo4,1578429966.0,The one in black.

AskReddit,fdgvj30,t3_el2az5,1578409374.0,Either Pete or Mycah (sp?) from Warehouse 13.  That could be interesting.
Cooking,fdgro9r,t1_fdgn5lc,1578406570.0,"I will never understand the point of boiling frozen veggies.  If serving plain, just throw them in the microwave - they come out way better.  I never knew why my MIL's veggies seemed soulless until I saw her boil them at my place."
Cooking,fdgri7z,t1_fdgcrpj,1578406444.0,"I modify most recipes I use, even on the first try, because nearly all of the spice quantities are way too low.  Even (especially!) with baking."

I'm mildly concerned with the nutmeg, which I have learned I don't like, but I think I have to make this next week."
harrypotter,fdgql99,t1_fdgis8c,1578405733.0,"I had science fairs in high school, and one that maybe counted in middle school (all post 2000).  Nothing in elementary school though."
dndmemes,fde4cuu,t1_fdcpix5,1578330901.0,"The airplane scene made me extraordinarily upset.  I haven't watched anything since then.  I know I'm overly sensitive (it's been a problem for a while), but I just could not bring myself to watch so many absolutely horrible people."
bulletjournal,fddx0r4,t3_eksqo0,1578326047.0,"Bravo!  I've never seen a curvy dutch door, but I think it looks great and adds something special."
aww,fcwhr3v,t1_fcw95yt,1578025946.0,I have a 2.5 year old.  I'd say chances are high that you're correct.
bulletjournal,fcv3as1,t3_eiwmrf,1577993766.0,This is amazing.

AskReddit,fc3suvy,t1_fc3j9ik,1577397758.0,It sounds like you have a great husband.  :)  I wish you the greatest happiness in the coming years.
Cooking,fbszu4n,t3_ee57u2,1577064567.0,Oh crap you're right.  I told my SO to pick some up but I'm not sure it made it on his list....
