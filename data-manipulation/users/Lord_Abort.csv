To say something is ""very American"" is to describe it exemplifying those subjective values.

I think this polarization you're worried about is a good thing in this case. I want a guy like this to stand out from his attacker. I want people to see this and think less of the racist. I want people like Usman to be the example of what it means to be American."

There are documented cases of people being shot in the heart and still shooting back and attacking for up to 5sec, killing other people. There are people who have taken an entire magazine of bullets to the body and still didn't stop attacking people.

This is why, in self defense, it's taught not to take any chances and to have the weapon that will do the most amount of damage possible to stop the threat as quickly as possible so that you and others don't die.

If you've ever been in a situation where you thought you could die, you would understand how frightening it is and how desperately you want to do anything you can for it to stop as soon as possible."

Despite American exceptionalism, despite having more money than anyone else on the planet, despite claiming to be the best in the world, we shrug our shoulders?

No, the truth is even though Congressional studies have suggested that we could help more people AND save more money in the long term by taking care of everybody with free healthcare, people are afraid of letting someone have something if they feel that they don't deserve it.

They're crippled by 40 and broke. Look at 95% of anybody who tries to start their own business. They go bankrupt reaching for a 5% chance of success, and not because they didn't work hard enough.

I look at my own office job. The three supervisors above me have worked there for over 20yrs and aren't going anywhere. The couple people I know who I watch always stay late, always take the toughest work, and take no breaks make the same small amount I do after the past 5yrs of watching them kill themselves at work. Hell, two people I worked with were under the age of 55 and died within the last 3yrs from heart issues. They sent a card around. Maybe if I was making more than 30k/yr, I would try harder. /rant

>Efforts in the 19C and 20C to domesticate the eland, elk, moose, musk ox, zebra, and bison have met with limited success.  Only 14 large animals have been domesticated: sheep, goat, cow, pig, horse, Arabian camel, Bactrian camel, llama and alpaca, donkey, reindeer, water buffalo, yak, Bali cattle, and Mithan (gayal, domesticated Gaur).  (This chapter is less concerned with small animals such as guinea pigs and birds, which do not provide transportation, military uses, or load carrying.)  The requirements for domestication are: (1) omnivore or herbivore (exception: dog), (2) rapid growth (elephants too slow), (3) breed well in captivity (cheetahs need more room, vicuña's long mating rituals are inhibited), (4) suitable disposition (grizzly bear, hippo, onager, zebra, and African buffalo cannot be tamed), (5) accepts penning (deer, gazelle, and antelope panic on penning), and (6) have a developed social structure and hierarchy so can accept subordinate role and herding (e.g., cats don't herd).  Some species such as zebras, peccaries, etc. have never been domesticated.  Domesticated animals are changed through mutations from their wild progenitors, not just tamed.  Many have gotten smaller under domestication and have been otherwise modified for greater milk production, more wool, etc.
Only one large animal, the llama/alpaca, is a New World domesticate (other New World domesticates include the guinea pig, Muscovy duck, turkey, and dog).  Eurasia had many more animal candidates for domestication than the New World, giving its inhabitants a competitive advantage."
