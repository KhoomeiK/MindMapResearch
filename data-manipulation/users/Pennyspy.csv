fatlogic,ffffwbv,t1_fff5caz,1579883080.0,"The mods tend to claim it's because of triggering effects for ED's, whenever any talk of food habits come up. It's just not really explicitly explained. But it does have that 'we are not a debate subreddit' caveat in its manifesto now. 

Most of their sub's rules list is really depressing, actually. Weird place."
fatlogic,ffffgnb,t1_fffb15l,1579882810.0,"Yep, There are usually a LOT of deleted (probably very reasonable) replies under those questions, too."
fatlogic,fffan93,t1_ffdceaz,1579879759.0,"Did you see the Secret Eaters where the guy was putting double cream on his morning cereal? With jam(UK)/jelly(US) too! So they cleared up one mystery pretty fast.

Edit: OK, entire thread on this below - but still a great episode. :)"
fatlogic,fffah0z,t3_et3f6y,1579879651.0,"These statements keep confusing 'thin' with 'fit' or 'able to function on a basic day to day level', don't they? Or 'healthy BMI'. Argh."
fatlogic,fffa6nt,t1_ffdzzfx,1579879465.0,Likewise. Do not miss the shortness of breath that was already happening at that stage.
fatlogic,fff9vrc,t1_fff3zt1,1579879268.0,Now that's a bestselling diet book right there.
fatlogic,fff9uiz,t1_fff7o01,1579879246.0,And eat it constantly. Otherwise you'll hit starvation mode and then where will you be?!
fatlogic,fff9qsc,t1_fff3sua,1579879179.0,"Thanks, grin, happy to provide extra trauma wherever possible..."
fatlogic,fff9m10,t1_fff2mgo,1579879092.0,"Beefcake!!!

Heh."
fatlogic,fff9htj,t1_fff8f1k,1579879016.0,"I know who you mean and it it a really really strange place to visit. 

Lots of people asking how to unintentionally lose weight there too and tying themselves in knots. Really sad."
fatlogic,ffetpr4,t1_ffeasfi,1579865080.0,"That giant, enormous, pillowy void...

Agh."
fatlogic,ffetmju,t1_ffegj9f,1579864960.0,"It's always, always, so that they can then shriek that diets don't work and make you even fatter! It's the most obvious self-sabotage and they really don't see it - or  dare to admit it - to themselves."
fatlogic,ffccvk9,t3_esif8n,1579796720.0,"Hello multi-pack of Fruit Pastilles. Goodbye, entire multi-pack of fruit pastilles. Jeez. That's a huge lie up there. I'm gonna eat the lot unless I'm having an amazing blast of willpower."
fatlogic,ffccpul,t1_ffcart4,1579796621.0,Right! And it's getting more prevalent. I really am worried at how far from reality some people are getting. The over-generalisation of it all is especially scary.
fatlogic,ffcc9jr,t1_ff7004d,1579796337.0,"It's so insidious and it makes people who are trying to get healthy, who fall for this 'no diets eva' bullshit, into going, 'then how do i not intentionally get healthy' and so round and round it goes...

This mindset stigmatises and massively over-complicates simply moving more and eating a little bit less."
fatlogic,ffcaaoo,t1_ffc40n2,1579795103.0,"Exactly. That seems to be the crux of an awful lot of the 'anti diet' movement. They couldn't do it sensibly so will scream that attention to diet sets off horrible disorders in anyone who even measures how much pasta they're eating.

I fully understand how it's a trigger for some people. But that's all the more reason to approach it sensibly instead of a blanket negative response like the example above."
fatlogic,ff9gb6u,t1_ff9f75z,1579712400.0,"Right? Is there something they aren't telling us...?

Edit: or ARE telling us."
fatlogic,ff9g4vx,t1_ff9dya5,1579712293.0,Keep it on the side and you're all good.
fatlogic,ff9foxi,t1_ff9aros,1579712021.0,"Seems that way all too often, and I feel like the loudest ones really want that and actively discourage anyone trying to get healthier."
fatlogic,fen7ek2,t1_feikqvu,1579278604.0,"Ditto! Still a good time to jump around but oh, I look a total mess..."
fatlogic,femztwr,t1_femzpew,1579273775.0,Reminds me of Under the Skin. Yikes.
MitchellAndWebb,femoloj,t3_epnsal,1579264853.0,"I thought it was THE shit, though."
fatlogic,femf8jj,t1_femd66n,1579252398.0,Huh. That really explains the bizarre junk food sponsorship of so many sporting events. Like the Olympics.
fatlogic,fejsc1j,t1_fej9jz7,1579184642.0,"Or just as a skirt, with a nice block colour on top might work for you. I like those darker floral dresses, but I then need a lowish neckline."
fatlogic,fejs04z,t3_epajry,1579184403.0,"Can I just point out that Grandpa Simpson is a *terrible* way to show the passing down of wisdom?! Has she any awareness of that character at all?

In a 'fatlogic' exposure context, it does make total sense. But I doubt she intended it that way..."
fatpeoplestories,fegnkee,t1_fegg9r3,1579098067.0,"Some of the more incredible ones have ziplines and rock climbing walls, and actual fairgrounds, so, I guess there are options if your body can cope with it."
fatpeoplestories,fegng6f,t1_fefb53y,1579097982.0,Huh. No wonder those poor little robots rebelled.
fatlogic,fegjjav,t1_fefgp2m,1579094704.0,"That's such a valuable point. If they've never know anything different, never even had the example of feeling fitness in themselves, or witnessed the reality of someone they trust achieving it - then I guess it's far more likely to seem a pointless, daunting effort to strive for that state."
fatlogic,fedmmvi,t1_feanniq,1579015237.0,That's because the worst ones romanticise the shit out of cake and cookies.
fatlogic,fedm827,t1_fe43gnd,1579014965.0,Basically!(!)
fatlogic,fediv86,t3_enqqdd,1579012655.0,Brainwashed to believe it's impossible and utterly terrible to lose weight - this is incredibly sad.
fatlogic,fe8yaqi,t3_enpr5f,1578932313.0,It's the people that listen to their crap and buy into it that I feel worst for. Every time.
horror,fe8wuig,t3_eo4cj6,1578931948.0,"Greta (2018), sort of fits this on a more platonic level. I think Isabelle Huppert did an incredible job of being sweet and vulnerable. At first..."
horror,fe8v3yo,t1_fe8pisc,1578931281.0,"And it almost ended with a (double?) suicide, so at least that final helicopter escape has a nod to hope. Love that movie and the questions it raised."
fatlogic,fe8prsg,t3_enu47t,1578929055.0,"Why...why would they go straight to that few calories? They're an idiot looking for exactly that kind of pity, and I'm so glad someone responded with extreme sanity instead."
RagenChastain,fdq6040,t1_fdq4sbs,1578656382.0,"Huh, it would just involve walking quickly out of reach four or five times..."
fatlogic,fdnefjs,t1_fdk5xpn,1578584048.0,Don't give them ideas...
fatlogic,fdnaztu,t1_fdmke6t,1578581868.0,"I do wonder sometimes if it's linked to that residual Puritanism, and the only bodily pleasure some ever allow themselves is food. 

And they've forgotten/never known how it doesn't feel to feel rough all the time."
fatlogic,fdnaplw,t1_fdn6lgf,1578581679.0,"Yes, it's almost true but, it also reads like they're tying themselves in knots trying NOT to admit that, just maybe, they could lose a few pounds and be much happier. It's that fear of any 'intention' and inexplicable love of 'passivity' that makes this sad to read. Imo."
fatlogic,fdmtvhp,t1_fdkxju5,1578565544.0,"That is a valid response to something like 'Son of the Mask', mind you..."
antidiet,fdh3gnv,t3_eke64p,1578414563.0,Why bring up diets if you don't want to talk about diets? Surely this is breaking your own rules?
antidiet,fdgx6f9,t1_fdcgoqp,1578410526.0,"Seconded. A sustainable, realistic and lifelong 'diet' is the best bet, long term, for a decent shot at real health."
fatlogic,fdgvgcq,t1_fdfbc3w,1578409320.0,"She has a crazed look in her eyes when she goes on about this, too. Especially in that gross cake video. I think she knows exactly what she's doing."
fatlogic,fdgtfbh,t3_ekyc09,1578407867.0,"No, Garfield is NOT a role model! The excuses given for overfeeding their pets are disgusting.  

Also, that dissonance if they DO decide to put the animal on a diet, which works, but then but don't see how CICO could possible apply to the human body..."
fatlogic,fdgsvob,t1_fdfc4g5,1578407465.0,"Oh, that sub where intentional weight loss is the ultimate trigger for everyone? Sigh. It could be a useful resource - but every time, the slightest debate gets purged."
fatlogic,fdgso8a,t1_fdfm72h,1578407313.0,"Only they really, really want everyone else to do that too and it keeps creeping into mainstream magazines and documentaries.  Shudder."

fatlogic,fctw9dl,t1_fctrd73,1577962763.0,"They strongly refuse to admit food addiction is real, though."
fatlogic,fcn5ix0,t1_fcn50nx,1577803823.0,Christ. That's truly fucking sadistic.
fatlogic,fcmsbrw,t1_fcm3h29,1577789840.0,"Or blocking the way out of a crashed plane, I definitely care then, too."
fatlogic,fcms94v,t1_fcmayd8,1577789735.0,I fully agree. Addiction removes that pleasure after the initial bites. Nothing enjoyable about a voracious compulsion. I wish they would understand that difference.
fatlogic,fcks7u2,t1_fcjlzhh,1577732058.0,"In a nutshell, and intentionally taking any action to get healthy of course leads to anorexia. Grah."

fatlogic,fck4ajz,t3_ehmkaa,1577716168.0,Did she really say this? I've never read much by her and now I'm glad I haven't...
fatlogic,fc6prnd,t3_eghy6i,1577486399.0,It's like cause and effect doesn't even register with these people. Wtf.
