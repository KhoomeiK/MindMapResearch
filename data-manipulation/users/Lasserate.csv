judo,fdlc9sd,t1_fdkwp5u,1578520950.0,"You seem much more knowledgeable about the intricacies of wrestling than I am, so I want to clarify:

When I wrestled (briefly in school), we broke each sequence into pieces: grip, lift, throw, etc. A reverse body lift (in my vocabulary) is only the lift portion. The sequence still has to be finished with a throw. In the case of OP, that looks like a suplex to me - bend knees, pop hips, arch back, etc. Would you still call this a reverse body lift if OP got uke into the air and then drove forward with a slam? Lift is the same, throw is different. 

Unrelated note: I would not expect to see a kind of par terre body lift any time soon. A belly down opponent is in ne waza and so is tori if he drops his grips or puts knees on the ground. This makes it nearly impossible to body lift and throw for ippon. Makes more sense to just work the ground game.

judo,fdgwr85,t1_fdglm3y,1578410233.0,">Do you have a source saying those throws are illegal?

I'm sure I could dig up a link to the rules somewhere, but the whole idea behind greco-roman wrestling is that you cannot attack the legs (morote gari, kata guruma) or use your legs to attack (uchi mata, osoto gari, de ashi barai). You also score more points for spectacular throws (heft your opponent high off the mat, before slamming him) than you do for less impressive takedowns. These rules are what make the suplex an important part of greco.

>I'm not entirely sure any grappling arts are that different. Any way... it all turns into something similar eventually.

I disagree. Grappling as a concept is pretty straightforward. There are a finite number of ways that one person can put another person on the ground and, once there, do something unpleasant to them. For that reason there will always be similarities. However, each art (through its ruleset) has defined which aspects of grappling it wishes to focus on."
