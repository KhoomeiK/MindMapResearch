dogs,fe01cz6,t1_fdzzr0i,1578800655.0,Got an air filter that makes a white noise next to his crate and a big heavy blanket over it. Storms a comin’ so fingers crossed it works. Ironically I also have a fear of storms. Used to be really bad when I was a kid. So I know what it’s like.
dogs,fdzzuua,t1_fdzz2f3,1578799716.0,Fair. I don’t know if my new dog will be anxious in storms. But he’s generally a pretty nervous pup so my hopes aren’t high he’ll sleep through the night. He’s also not housebroken. So I worry if I bring him to my bed for the night he’ll leave some surprises for me to find in the morning.
dogs,fdhmm3q,t1_fdhm07z,1578425856.0,Thank you! He kept doing it and I was getting so worried cause “wheezing sound coming from dog” was coming up with some not so great results.
dogs,fdhm1a5,t1_fdhlnzi,1578425507.0,"Sorry I forgot to upload the one with sound. It has sound now. Okay I’ll look that up. I’m worried about my boy, I thought it was like a choking noise."
tumblr,fdcfvck,t3_ekftbj,1578273880.0,Bold to assume anyone texts me.
dogs,fdc51i9,t1_fdbnf91,1578267244.0,"Unfortunately my kitchen is very open so I’d pretty much have to get a fence to keep him in it. And also he looooves to eat everything. I’ve nicknamed him Hoover cause if there’s a crumb within a ten miles he will find it. I’ve tried to get up everything in the kitchen but I’m afraid he’ll figure out a way to get into the kitchen cabinets.

Once he’s less prone to accidents I plan on moving him to my large bathroom for the day. I was taught that it’s important to set up a dog for success. Essentially make it impossible for him to have an accident and he’ll learn to hold it quicker."
AskReddit,fdba01n,t3_ekalqa,1578255328.0,I got a dog! His name is Copper and I love him.
dogs,fdam61p,t1_fda7hin,1578247593.0,I plan on coming back on my lunch break at 12
dogs,fda4h7n,t1_fd7kv4y,1578241526.0,"Oh yeah my guy loves my couch. He has his spot. And if I sit in it he’ll stand on me until I move. Or just plop down on top of me.

Eventually I’d love to train him to hunt for antlers and bones in the woods (I’m a collector). That’ll be down the line once he learns the fun basic stuff!"
dogs,fda4by0,t1_fd6sn1x,1578241461.0,"I’m not sure. The shelter just said “hound”. He’s really small, only 30 pounds. I’ve never seen a treeing Walker this small."
dogs,fda3s8n,t1_fd6m2gu,1578241352.0,I am but I’m not sure how much he’s ever been crated. He may also be scared but he whines and cries alooot when he’s in there and can’t see me. Working on crate training now but trying to keep it chill cause the two week shutdown.
dogs,fda3l1m,t1_fd6750z,1578241268.0,"Yep! After the two week shutdown we’re gonna go to obedience school. Working on crate training today (it’s...sort of going well, but we’ll get there)"
dogs,fda3dij,t1_fd9856y,1578241183.0,I’ve also heard to keep the dog in a crate minus regimented playtimes and walks. I do keep a close eye on him to make sure he doesn’t have an accident but he’s not yet crate trained. So he just freaks out in the crate. I have to go to work tomorrow and I worry how he’ll do.
Breadit,fd086v9,t1_fcyyjue,1578115082.0,Sure did. I didn’t have any clean knives.
science,fcubgeu,t1_fcts8mq,1577977074.0,"A lot of talk about tinder on Reddit gets talked about by men using tinder. I, a woman who uses tinder, can tell ya that it’s not so super easy peasy for women either. I’m in the same boat as you. First month on tinder was great, since then? I’ve been pretty much thrown into the rift. 

I think it’s more of a model of “attractive people (men and women) get the lions share of the matches and everyone else gets to fight over the scraps”."
Breadit,fcsyw0s,t1_fcsypu6,1577928573.0,Yeah I’ll admit I got excited to try it. I do have another loaf I’ll let cool completely before breaking into it.
Breadit,fcsytu9,t1_fcsyoee,1577928530.0,"Oh, huh the recipe I was using didn’t say anything about cooking."
Breadit,fcsxsvw,t3_eiqyb9,1577927806.0,"The dough texture isn’t quite right. Does it look underdone or did something else go wrong? I proved it for 2 hours, baked for 45min."
Breadit,fcsmq4p,t1_fcsmlyh,1577919859.0,"https://gatherforbread.com/easy-perfect-yeast-bread/

I actually had to add two tablespoons of water during the kneading process because the dough was just falling apart it was so dry. But I worried about upsetting the balance of water and flour so I didn’t add anymore."
Breadit,fcsml2w,t1_fcsmhld,1577919766.0,His name is Al.
Zoomies,fcnwa7r,t1_fcn9l0y,1577819716.0,My college town had an enormous dog run in the form of a floodplain under a dam. It was so cool and I’m sad I moved away before I ever got a dog.
AskReddit,fcmva0d,t3_ehtq3g,1577793911.0,Animal skulls. Weird but I like them.
assholedesign,fckj1d6,t1_fck54iy,1577726407.0,"I highly recommend anyone who’s looking for a photoshop alternative to look into Clip Studio. It works super well for the iPad Pro and computers. Only like 8$ a month (iPad), or (i think?) 29$ one time payment (computer).  I use it at a professional capacity and have found anything photoshop can do clip can do."
Anxiety,fcj0lp3,t1_fcj0541,1577674311.0,Oh weird I didn’t know potassium can cause that. I thought it was an anxiety thing. I do eat a fair amount of coconut sweetened products.
Anxiety,fcizn4b,t1_fcizj28,1577673650.0,Yeah like a half second pause and then a hard beat that feels weird in your chest.
fitbit,fcgbau6,t1_fcabdfw,1577638305.0,I’ve hit the “begin sleep” button every time I’ve been to bed. Also I don’t seem to have any sort of “why did I get a simplified chart” link on mine. My battery is on 60%
nottheonion,fc9vzpi,t1_fc9onpo,1577559015.0,Unfortunately I found out recently that if you’re allergic to shrimp you’re probably also allergic to most insects.
MakeMeSuffer,fc7qzrk,t1_fc6zrns,1577516411.0,And they make excellent fish food
whatisthisthing,fc0f8i1,t1_fbyov1c,1577289302.0,Damn that’s pretty sick. I’d love to know what this is so I can get one for my mantle
