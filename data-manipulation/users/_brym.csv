aww,ffhscua,t1_ffhfkfh,1579951399.0,Only probably? Doesn't seem like the right amount of enough to me.
motorcycles,ffh08k2,t1_ffgff0q,1579919631.0,"To keep things on track somewhat, I'd love to kit out a bike with ruggedised computing. But the vibrations would probably shake all sorts of shit lose. Especially with the way I ride.

Would be an interesting challenge though."
motorcycles,ffga0pb,t1_ffg2h0w,1579901679.0,No doubt Intel would willingly talk to anyone right now. Those poor things only pulled in a little over $20b last quarter. I really hope they're coping alright.

AdviceAnimals,fevagqk,t3_eqkivg,1579395104.0,UK here. Much the same feeling whenever I get any notification about the royals.
television,fegtulq,t3_eoueh6,1579102401.0,Netflix or Amazon?

AdviceAnimals,fe4qmgl,t1_fe47oki,1578861915.0,"Which is what ideally needs to change. The way I do it is offer an accept or decline explaining they should only accept if they're ok with the 3rd party ads, trackers and cookies. If they click decline, things still function just fine. It's just a completely 3rd-party-free experience.

It's really not difficult. But wtf would I know. I've only been writing code for over 20 years."
AdviceAnimals,fe4m9je,t1_fe46zka,1578860805.0,"I agree. And I might've exaggerated a little by saying everyone. Unfortunately, I've seen them referred to / regarded as cookies more than a few times.

But hey, I've been using them just fine for ~6 years. Makes no difference to me at this point. Just commenting on what I've seen, and offering them up as a viable alternative to cookies."
AdviceAnimals,fe3j9fr,t1_fe331kd,1578849710.0,"It's also entirely possible (and fun!) to fuck with would-be malicious visitors by leading them on a wild goose chase with URLs which look like query strings, but aren't at all. I've lost count of the number of times I've gone through my server logs and found people hoping for a phpMyAdmin install, or WordPress or some other mainstream management platform, only to be shit out of luck every time."
AdviceAnimals,fe3eec8,t1_fe322zc,1578848516.0,And you're remarkably easily triggered - even though that sincerely wasn't my intention. So perhaps you're not up to the challenge. It's alright if you're not.
AdviceAnimals,fe2qp4y,t1_fe2lrbr,1578841833.0,"Stop wearing your tinfoil hat, then. You're making an arse of yourself. If you're too lazy or ignorant to code a better approach, you're doing a massive disservice to any visitor to your site."
AdviceAnimals,fe2pn8u,t1_fe2mair,1578841540.0,"Technically, yes. That's wrong. Local and session storage are technically not cookies. But everyone calls them cookies regardless. And sure, there are security concerns associated with them, but iirc, those concerns are largely related to 3rd party sites attempting to scrape their contents. Something easily mitigated by not using anything 3rd party at all.

A pain in the ass, sure. But at least in doing so, you'd be able to proudly promote the fact that your site/pwa/product is not only dependancy free, but you are also demonstrably conscious of common privacy concerns."
AdviceAnimals,fe2m1gg,t1_fe2ko7e,1578840318.0,"Recode how you do sessions then. If you're not letting any 3rd parties place ads, cookies, or track your visitors, then you can easily write something using, say, local/session storage to replace those cookies."
AdviceAnimals,fe2ki8a,t1_fe2aibx,1578839515.0,"Well that's not true. You can absolutely make websites functional without forcing ads, cookies or tracking down visitors throats. Almost nobody does, though, because greed."

IAmA,fctoeu4,t1_fct4jhh,1577951418.0,"I guessed right, cool. I've toyed with some airband scanning back in the 90's, and some SDR a few years ago. Recently picked up an RT5 to get back into it again. Nothing spectacular by any stretch, but might as well start somewhere, right.

Anyway, I only heard about Echo from a video the other day, then read your post here. So I'd guess those shark hotspots would definitely be cheating too.

This stuff continues to fascinate me. Are you taking advantage of skipping, if I understand things correctly? Thanks for your post."
sysadmin,fcsqhj1,t1_fcsnkye,1577922534.0,I feel this guy's pain. It's so unnecessarily dependency driven now compared to when I started with JS back in 98. Think I'll just stick to writing the whole thing myself.
sysadmin,fcsndwl,t1_fcsj6ku,1577920328.0,It bugs me more than it probably should how dependant so much of the web has become on frameworks/libraries. I genuinely wonder sometimes if front end devs could even make their sites without them anymore.
aww,fcs30b6,t1_fcs12hi,1577910720.0,This was 9 years ago. Damn!
IAmA,fcrk5ri,t3_eih87o,1577902875.0,So I guess using echo link would be thought of as cheating?
