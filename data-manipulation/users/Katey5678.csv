USMilitarySO,feljn3d,t3_epsdpc,1579223770.0,"I would say that the reality is what everyone is saying (i.e., cheaters will cheat no matter what), plus the military essentially creates the cheating scenarios. In civilian life, it's not common to not see your spouse for 9+ consecutive months - people may life apart, but generally they will see each other in-between if it's a LDR. Also, people who do LDRs outside of the military live that life day-in and day-out. The military is not as stable - you'll have 6 months together and then 6 months apart."

USMilitarySO,feh6d8c,t3_ep4fzm,1579110082.0,"I'm not sure if there's anything you can do, honestly. Going just off of what I have heard from other people, stepping in yourself may actually hurt the process and make it work slower because the military is pretty wary of spouses getting involved with these kind of things. Unfortunately I think anything that can be done would be on your husband's side.

I'm so sorry! I feel for you in this position. That really, really stinks..."
college,fegmatt,t1_fef603i,1579097092.0,"I will say that part of this issue may be the way the LOR system normally works. In my field, normally a person writes a LOR when one is requested (e.g., one of my RAs is applying for graduate school, and asks for a LOR for her application). I've never heard of getting a LOR just upon finishing, but I was getting the impression that this is what she suggested, and thus something that is common in your field. 

Honestly, if one of my RAs was asking me for a LOR, I'd ask what for. If they told me ""for nothing, I just want it"" I would explain that it's not common for me to just *give* a LOR to someone. Normally, the student isn't able to read it. However I'd also explain that I'd be happy to write one when they are applying for a job/graduate school.

Honestly it sounds like ya'll aren't communicating well. You need a mediator to figure this out."
college,fee5m1p,t1_fedp5bt,1579026879.0,"I did this, but instead of right after class, I would study the next day. Studies show that spaced learning is most effective. So even reviewing notes/studying the next day is giving you extra practice, but forcing your brain to store the information and then subsequently recall it. This strengthens the memory association, allowing for easier recall the next time you need it!"
college,fedyo8k,t1_fec4ics,1579022675.0,"I think you should go to her one more time first (in-person best), but I wouldn't use the word ""stern."" I think you need to make it clear to her that your time in the internship is over, and that you are grateful for the opportunity. Iterate that you do not have time to continue to help in her lab. Say that, however, you participated in the internship so that you can have a letter of recommendation for opportunities elsewhere. Ask her when you can expect to receive the letter of recommendation. Hold her to that deadline, and if she doesn't meet it, say you would like to loop the dean into the conversation (after meeting with him/her to discuss beforehand).

If she says she can't give it to you, push a little bit before saying ""I feel like this was a disingenuous commitment, then. I don't think this is fair and think we need someone to mediate this conversation, I would suggest the dean."""

books,fea90df,t1_fe9zzp6,1578945789.0,"The point is that Huxley took ideas that (at the time, 1930s) were seen as ideal and took them to the extreme to reveal how (non) utopic they were. In America, eugenics were gaining steam and the idea of modern medicine being able to cure all problems was rampant. In BNW, humanity's undoing is our pursuit of pleasure - through drugs, through sex, through aesthetic. Creating a ""perfect"" society where pleasure is always available and socially sought after. Where pain in terms of having to think or exert oneself is gone. Where we are conditioned from birth to accept who we are in society, and thus feel no need to advance or feel discontented. 

This is the mark of great science fiction - speculation in the extraordinary in order to explore the real, lived world where we reside."
books,fe9ya72,t1_fe9l62v,1578942548.0,"I don't have a ton of time, so I'll just link what others have said! Basically, it was written in a time where the ""dystopia"" was seen as something that could be a ""utopia."" 

""Brave New World is either a perfect-world utopia or its nasty opposite, a dystopia, depending on your point of view: its inhabitants are beautiful, secure and free from diseases and worries, though in a way we like to think we would find unacceptable. ""Utopia"" is sometimes said to mean ""no place"", from the Greek ou-topos; others derive it from eu, as in ""eugenics"", in which case it would mean ""healthy place"" or ""good place"". Sir Thomas More, in his own 16th-century Utopia, may have been punning: utopia is the good place that doesn't exist. ""

FWIW, 1984 is very different from BNW; 1984 is more clearly a dystopia, whereas BNW is a dystopian/utopian world. I'd definitely recommend picking it up at some point!"

This was my first foray into Austen, and classics really are normally not my thing. I did enjoy it, and didn't feel like I was dragging through it *most of the time*. However, I fail to see why so many people see this as a 5-star mind blowing book? I give it 3.5/5 stars. I enjoyed it and it was okay. But the themes were just...dated and unimportant to me?

HomeImprovement,fe4zqxa,t3_enp368,1578864303.0,"I love my Home Depot cordless blinds! I had to get custom sized ones for one of our very large windows so it ended up pretty pricey (total around $400) but it was worth it. Even the custom ones came in within a week and a half. Plus, they were pretty simple to install. Cordless is a huge pro I didn't anticipate being able to get with our budget."
