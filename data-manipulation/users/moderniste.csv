JUSTNOMIL,ffgr9pz,t3_etfb64,1579913038.0,"I’m rather meanly cackling at what must have certain panic after she read OP’s text. Those wheels must have been *spinning* in an anxious combination of “oh shit; busted!!!” and “I need a good story—and QUICK!” 

If she was really making a sandwich, she wouldn’t have scurried out of the kitchen, nor would there have been any time delay—she just would have said, “yeah—where’s your frying pan?” I think my favorite part of her  frantic regrouping, with her stomach sinking like she’d swallowed a cannonball and her mind racing, was her feigned nonchalance after waiting/panicking for far longer than an innocent person would. “Makin’ a sandwich; *want one???*”   Smooth, MIL; smooth."
JUSTNOMIL,ffg7nfx,t1_ffczryv,1579900217.0,"Within the JN subs, I’ve noticed a whole bunch of JN parents who latch on to the whole Tough Love model and totally misuse it to abuse and control kids who are nowhere close to needing such a strict method of discipline. Like, Tough Love is for kids who are *severely* off the rails—kids who display lots of Conduct Disorder behaviors.  (And even then, it’s rather controversial.) JustNo parents become enamored with all of the power it gives them—strip the room bare and take off the door and *then you’ll see who’s boss*!"
JustNoSO,fffaw0f,t1_ffd24hx,1579879912.0,"I love that comic. Just love it. I’ve always wondered if at least some of the “helpless” men we encounter have been made that way by the sort of controlling smother-mothers that populate the JNMIL sub. The kind of men who were raised by JustNo moms who are the type that worship their male offspring and infantilize them well past adulthood. No woman will ever be good enough for mommy’s widdle diddums, and she creates the expectation that her perfect baby boy needs a subservient wifey to slave around after him, just like mommy did.  

These are often the kind of women who constitutionally dislike other women and believe in strict, traditional gender roles for every other woman *but themselves*. As narcs, they’re always a very “special” exception to every rule. And so, they create privileged little man-baby sons whom they train to treat all other women as domestic slaves.  A good number of men are kind and decent people at heart, and instinctively resist this kind of “programming” and can be encouraged to de-FLEA themselves with relative ease. But there are definitely some men who slide right in to the gender roles of mommy’s training, and become the husbands of every woman’s domestic nightmare."

As a comparison, this is a picture of [Heinrich VonKittykat ](https://imgur.com/gallery/DpdiNgd) who is 9 months old and already 11 pounds.  He’s very lean, but tall and well-muscled. Looking at your beautiful girl, it’s hard to see how she’s almost 1/2 the weight of Heinie, but that fur must be very deceptive!"
aww,ffcd8ys,t1_ffbsr74,1579796951.0,My sentiments exactly. This is a GORGEOUS photograph—the technical aspects are as compelling as the subject matter.
aww,ffcd4ur,t1_ffc5ruo,1579796881.0,"Sigh. The house I grew up in was at the end of a small cul-de-sac that got no traffic other than the residents. All the houses had huge 1/2 acre yards that backed up to a creek. Our cats were outdoor cats, as were our neighbors, and they’d worked out a sort of territorial truce that minimized fights. All of the neighbors had also spayed/neutered their cats, so aggressive mating behavior wasn’t an issue. This is pretty much the only setup in which I’d allow my cats to go outdoors. I live in San Francisco now, where I have no backyard other than our roof garden, and I live on a street that bisects two heavily trafficked boulevards. There’s simply no way that I could ever let Heinrich VonKittykat outside, so he’s never been allowed to get past the front or back door. 

We keep him in tip-top shape with 3 people who give him lots of play sessions with the kitty fishing rod, and endless games of fetch up and down the stairs. Plus, lots of fun places to perch and plenty of cat trees around the flat. Outdoor cats can get so banged up and catch unfortunate diseases—their life span plummets in comparison to an indoor kitty. I wish more cat owners realized that cats aren’t these totally independent creatures that you just dump food in a bowl and then see them once every couple of days. It’s so irresponsible, and you miss out on so much of your kitty’s personality.  End of way-too-long rant."
aww,ffcbr5m,t1_ffc4xk5,1579796020.0,"Wow—what an amazing looking cat!!!  I’m usually partial to Oriental style breeds—long, sleek ultra-shorthairs. But your big girl is absolutely captivating. What’s the temperament of the breed?  Are they anything like gregarious, friendly Maine Coons?"
JUSTNOMIL,ff9rn2o,t3_esetu6,1579719626.0,"There’s so much incredibly over-dramatized SOBBING in this sub. As a woman in the same age group as these big babies, it really takes a lot to make me cry, *and I’m very conscious of making a scene in public*. The JNMILs are so focused upon using their number one manipulation weapon that they’ll sob loudly and for incredibly long amounts of time in front of large numbers of people. (And they have that unique talent of being able to turn off the waterworks in an instant.) My god—this would be so freaking EMBARRASSING for me to have so many people watching me decompensate!  But for a JN, it’s just another day at the races."
JUSTNOMIL,ff3qld6,t1_ff3ee8p,1579546724.0,"OMG—what is it with this cranky witches who get super *competitive* about the silly baby shower games??? I’ve seen this many times on this sub—butthurt JNMILs who bounce instantly to wronged victim status, and then spend two hours whispering and crabbing about paranoid conspiracy theories. About the fucking diaper-the-balloon race. 

The cherry on the poop sundae is when they are mortally offended by the quality of their prize, should they win a game. This is often enough to start a years-long gossip campaign and a lifetime grudge. Having been the auntie who threw all the birthday parties for my niece and nephew, I never saw any young children who were as cutthroat and pissy as these middle-aged harridans. It’s totally bonkers."
JUSTNOMIL,ff1pswu,t1_ff07709,1579483486.0,She sounds like she’s being that stereotypical scary-clingy girlfriend who is “in loooove” after 2 weeks and has started to drop broad hints about “the next move”. The fact that she’s well into middle age and not an inexperienced 21 year-old makes this even more pathetic. I’m close to 100% sure that her “dude” has no idea that their little “road trip” is a full-on meet-the-family event. Yeah—dudes aren’t typically into baby showers—and for good reason:  it’s usually a *woman’s* purview.
JUSTNOMIL,ff1oa6k,t3_er4aw4,1579482531.0,"Oh barf; her 27 year-old baaaaby boy is too widdle to have his own baby.  She’s still operating like he’s a dependent 14 year-old who just loooves his mommy, and she must protect him from the scary girls who are all scheming to take away his precious innocence. That’s some next-level smothering/infantilizing!  Women who refuse to segue gracefully into the “empty nest” part of their life are a distasteful mixture of tiresome and domineering. 

I do hope that the combination of becoming a new little family and realizing how manipulative MIL is will be enough to turn DH’s head permanently towards his family. Not his mommy; his *family* of you, him and baby-to-come. And that he realizes that his power-tripping mom is treating him like a naive and helpless young child, not a grown man with a child on the way."
JUSTNOMIL,fezqehk,t3_eqyhv5,1579460339.0,"From some of your previous posts, I can see that it’s important to you to be the “peacekeeper”, and that you’re very reluctant to “pick a side”. Peacekeepers are not always the good guys. Not when one party is clearly in the wrong. And not when you have important loyalties and responsibilities to the side that you took vows with. I have a feeling that your mother has *always* been the kind of person who makes life extremely difficult if everyone isn’t exactly toeing her line. Kids who grow up with this dynamic often end up almost obsessive about not rocking the boat. With that phrase in mind, I urge you to read the essay about “Rocking the Boat” (that’s not the exact title, but you’ll figure it out) that’s in the JNMIL sub sidebar. 

If you had remained single and decided to go all in with remaining a son first above all else, you could decide to put up with your mother’s domineering nature forever. But you didn’t. You made *your* family with your wife and little one. You cannot remain “neutral” anymore. And no one is going to be particularly happy about you running around trying to please everyone. Your mom seems out of line, and unaccustomed to being told “no”. You have to pick a side. Which means your mom will be unhappy. 

Your task is to always support your wife and baby first, and learn to be comfortable with making your mom unhappy when you’re doing the right thing. After a lifetime of programming, this will feel so wrong at first. But it’s like any bad habit—you’ll learn to overcome that anxiety, but you’ll have to be motivated and carefully disciplined. Therapy will definitely help here—specifically CBT, which is an ultra-practical therapeutic method of training yourself to react in a healthy manner. It sounds like you’re the kind of guy who will be able to roll with this—I have faith in you!!"
JustNoSO,fezn7z8,t1_feyupz0,1579459254.0,"And letting dog pee sit for days?? That’s just so GROSS!!  It’s so beyond the most minimal standards of hygiene, and what most people would consider to be the minimal standard of living. Ewww."
JustNoSO,feyhkvr,t3_eqvtc6,1579445684.0,"Good for you. GOOD FOR YOU.  

That wasn’t just an unkempt house. That was scary, dangerous and disgusting levels of filth. Almost like he was trying to aggressively turn your living quarters into a hellhole. That level of nastiness isn’t fit for animals, let alone young children.  (And those poor animals—I really get angry when a cat—normally a fastidious animal—has such awful litter conditions that they poop on the floor. Or a dog who knows it’s not OK to pee inside has to do so because their human is a lazy piece of shit.)

The appalling condition of your house was a direct reflection of the state of his inner being. And that’s not a pretty sight.  This is not someone who is “fit for human consumption”; he’s crossed a major line of antisocial behavior. This is so “in your face”! You are not being too picky or petty AT ALL. And you’re a very strong woman as well as an awesome mom."
JUSTNOMIL,fevmk0w,t1_ferakfh,1579399128.0,"She’s being such an embarrassingly typical Ugly American (‘Murican); to her, the rest of the world is a vague collection of socialist white people and then scary brown/tan/black people. American culture is universal—right??  (/s) Surely the rest of humanity studies up on American history and culture, and learns American English because .*that’s how everyone is supposed to talk*. I see boorish idiots like this when I’m traveling abroad and I just want to shrink down and disappear. And those nincompoops are the few Ugly Americans who actually even leave America and (gasp) visit another country that’s not the Disney Castaway Cay.  Sigh. I want to be tolerant and patient with these types, but their own intolerance exists on such a massive scale that it’s hard to be the better person."
JUSTNOMIL,fetc8oj,t1_fep5wha,1579373822.0,"I’ve noticed a distinct trend amongst JN women “of a certain age” who think they have full permission to slap, punch, kick or spit on law enforcement officers at will. Cuz they’re maaaaad. As if “poor sweet lil’ ol’ lady” is gonna fly when you just assaulted an officer. That same ridiculous entitlement goes on when they end up incarcerated. Since they’re such incredibly special ladies who aren’t like “those other people” aka inmates, they order the corrections officers around like they are staff, and extend that same willingness to throw a wobbly, including some delightfully charming physical assaults on a CO.  Lots and lots of extended sentences for the entitled JN perps and jailbirds."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fep19hb,t3_eprcif,1579309888.0,"I’m 51, so I didn’t grow up with something like a phone that held all of your secrets and was like a primer to your personality. Back then, you had a diary. I’m lucky to have awesome JustYes parents (JustYes entire family, really), but my close friend had a seriously JustNo controlling nightmare of a mother. With the constant emotional terrorism, my friend badly needed a place of refuge that was just hers where she could let out her inner self. She had a diary that she kept at her father’s house—split custody. 

When she was 12 or so, she was able to make the decision to live full time at her dad’s house to get away from JNMom. And JNMom had a narc extinction burst and broke into the father’s house, stole the diary, and poured bleach all over the brand-new pretty lavender matching bedding that my friend was super excited to have as her own.  (Of course, at JNMom’s house my friend was under a narc power-tripping “Tough Love” regime of one outfit of clothes, a stripped-bare mattress on the floor, and no bedroom door.  Her pretty new bedroom was her ultimate fantasy of awesomeness; her mom knew that.)

The contents of that intensely private diary got weaponized and was used against her for all of her teen years.  My friend said that it felt like her mom was prying open her brain to utterly invade her entire being. She suffered horrible insomnia because she’d dream of her mom literally breaking open her head to get at “the secrets”. Invading a young person’s precious privacy is such an incredibly abusive narc power move. You can’t even have the inside of your own head to yourself. 

I’ve noticed a large number of JN parents who use invading privacy as an ongoing source of terrorism. Lots of unfounded “Tough Love”, constant “checking in”, no passwords on any electronic devices or social media, tracking devices, questioning their kids’ friends about kid, and using therapy as an invasion of privacy by making up egregious lies about their child’s psychiatric well-being in order to make sure that the therapist can’t be used as a refuge. It’s such a sneaky method of abuse; they can so easily just say that they’re being “protective”, or make up dramatic lies about why their child must be mentally tortured around the clock.  I’m really happy that you’ve taken action to get her TF out of your phone. But it’s totally understandable that you have PTSD from this. What she did was *torture*."
JUSTNOFAMILY,feoxsfi,t1_feilsfa,1579307705.0,"Also, OP should be prepared for the fact that at some point soon, she’s going to get her SSI check and go right back out and buy a bunch of drugs and get wasted again. Like, by 12:01 am of her check deposit. She’s had exactly *zero* treatment; detoxing on its own does bupkis for staying clean long term. She needs to really want recovery and want it *bad*, and she needs the help of a structured program. Even though she’s dying. Especially because she’s dying. 

I’m a recovering addict, and being sober is such an incredible, life-changing and profound gift. Really—this has been the best almost-6-years of my life. I cannot imagine *anything* that would make me crave being wasted again. I’ve been through a serious loss, and using didn’t even enter my mind. 

It’s really sad, but also *annoying* that an addict would use her limited time on the planet to be as high as possible. Some people think that if you only have x amount of difficult time left, then why not be wasted?  But if you’ve experienced the intense personal growth and the overall lightness of being that you find with recovery and sobriety, being high is no longer “fun”. It just puts you right back into a world of shit that you know far too well. Being wasted hasn’t felt like that first “awesome” time in years, and it’s not going to magically become adult Disneyland just because you’re dying. It’s going to be harsh, make your body feel awful, give you crippling come-downs that your weaker, older body just cannot handle, and your brain will go *straight* to strung-out and miserable, skipping the “fun party” stage entirely. Just look at how quickly OP’s JNMom decompensated:  she wasn’t “having a blast”. 

I actually find her to be incredibly shallow to think that her last days should be spent selfishly indulging herself by getting wasted out of her head. I’ve watched two different sober addicts die from disease, and in their last days, they both were thinking A LOT about what they could leave to the world from their knowledge of addiction and recovery. Neither one of them was in “fuck it” selfish mode—recovery makes you too humble to waste your time in that manner. I’m not saying that recovery makes a person who is facing a difficult, painful death a perfect Buddha-like Being of Light. But neither does it allow you the “fuck it” excuse to indulge in drugs that you don’t even *like* anymore, let alone make things extra-shitty for everyone around you. 

If this is how OP’s JNMom sees fit to spend her last days, OP is more than entitled to stay far away and leave her to it. Even in the nearness of death, you don’t enable an addict with attention and tacit approval. You quietly keep your distance until/if they sincerely decide to reach out for help. Dying with the dignity of embracing your hard-won sobriety is a great gift that you can pass on to your loved ones, who will respect you and know that you went out the way you wanted."
