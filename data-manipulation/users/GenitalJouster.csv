If you read my post it's about when you don't immediately play the champ when you unlock the skin. Sure once you've used it it's set as default but just picture this, because it's actually the current situation for me:

I just unlocked Dawnbringer Soraka from a skin reroll. I also currently only play ARURF. Whether or not I will get Soraka there is entirely random. I might forget I got the skin by the time I play her next. If I could set it out of the game that would be very convenient for me. Not sure if anyone else ever had the issue of forgetting to select the skin and been annoyed by it. But this seems a simple enough solution honestly.

He eventually fell asleep in a chair in the kitchen (I told him to move to the couch but he didn't want to. Maybe he couldn't. The couch was like stand up straight and let yourself fall over distance [this is not an exaggeration]).

Anyways. An hour or so passes and I come by the kitchen and ask how he's doing. One of the guys who lived there checked on him and asked if everything is ok. My acquaintance mumbles some incomprehensible words. As the guy is totally lost and in the process of asking him what he said, I was already heading out of the kitchen to where I thought I remembered the storeroom to be to get a bucket - yelling at the guy ""we need a bucket or something"". He instantly understands and dashes past me, bringing the other guy a bucket who then violently vomits into it.

Remarkably (yea, everybody clapped j/k) the host thanked me profusely for being so quick to understand that the guy wanted to puke. I mean I've seen how smashed he was and I've been there myself. I didn't even think. Even if it was the wrong assumption a bucket wouldn't have hurt. Saved them from a big mess to clean up.

Some sort of fear probably but I just cannot imagine him keeping the point and click 2 minutes hard CC. He will probably keep a sustain from W but his current W is just not the kind of gameplay RIOT puts on modern champs.

The bouncy E mechanic is actually something that I could see staying. I find it fun and it has high moments if you get it to bounce between two players. But they will probably keep him as a jungler so I suppose he will get something that doesn't feel so godawful when you're doing single target camps.
