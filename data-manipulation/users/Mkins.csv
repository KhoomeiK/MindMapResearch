Iirc there's 4 little high capacity connectors in there that deal with display and Ethernet and these were what was failing. If we flipped the cable display would work but ethernet not and vice versa. I'm still not entirely convinced that I didn't just go crazy but it was pretty destinctive."

. 79 cents on the dollar makes a lot more sense when it's about earnings per capita and not earnings for a specific position, as it's factoring in the disparity between men and women in stem and leadership roles, as well as risk and physical labour intensive jobs, all of which are male dominated at this point in time.
