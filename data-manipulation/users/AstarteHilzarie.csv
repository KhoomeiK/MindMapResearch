It's usually normal bills and expenses that an actual job would pay without making a big deal of it, but it's a #goals post when you make $5 shilling shitty makeup. I've seen posts of a woman showing the receipt for her kid's dental bill with the card, and the number on the receipt didn't even match the Younique card, so not only was it a normal bill that she was trying to show off, she didn't even use the Younique card to pay for it!"
Youniqueamua,ff9bnd3,t1_ff9aey4,1579709277.0,"Selling the lifestyle is absolutely important for an MLM. The makeup isn't the product, the real goal is to recruit people. How do you recruit people? By making your position look as appealing as possible (because you definitely can't lean on your quality products being just so great people will jump on board to sell them.) It's really common for women to be told to ""fake it til you make it"" and present themselves as having much better income than they have to influence other people to want to join them. Nobody is going to trust someone who is struggling to pay their bills and horribly in debt to tell them about a ""great opportunity,"" but they may fall for the woman who is ""self-employed"" with money to throw around. 

Younique even pushes it with their ""purple card"" (which is like a preload card that they use to pay the huns) that they encourage them to post pictures of their purchases with. You'll find pictures of women holding the card with their finger over the numbers next to a cup of Starbucks or the receipt for groceries or something to show how their success with Younique allows them ""little luxuries"" though even those are often faked. 

I've even heard of people taking a lavish vacation and spending a large amount of the time changing clothes and locations to take a ton of pictures so that they can spread them out throughout the year and make it look like they're frequently going on amazing trips, when in reality all of the pictures are from one trip that they spent hustling and not even enjoying."

beyondthebump,fds5dy8,t1_fds3a9b,1578694734.0,"I'm sure pectoral exercises can help if you really get that area toned, but I feel like the fatty tissue in the boob itself is never going to firm back up again since it's just fatty tissue and glands and not the muscle itself. 

I mean, I could be wrong, I haven't researched it or anything but I feel like it would be all over subs like this if there were a way to ""fix"" post-breastfeeding boobs for those who don't like them."

Edit, retraction, I just looked again and yeah that's a weird-ass big eye filter."

trashy,fds1lzz,t1_fdrsuf9,1578692982.0,"She is by no means a frumpy housewife, though. Her mugshot isn't the most flattering, but she certainly has good features. It's just a different style of makeup in the side-by-side pictures, and yeah, the gothy one is more appealing if that's what attracts you (I agree that she looks damn good in it) but I wouldn't use ""frumpy"" to describe the one on the right at all."
trashy,fds1dsz,t1_fdrmk3k,1578692842.0,"I think the ""duel"" bit comes in with the phone records showing the two men contacting each other multiple times, and that they met in a location that wasn't close to either of them or their usual hangouts. It indicates that they were both intentionally there for the purpose of encountering each other. At most, though, I would call it an arranged fight, not a ""medieval duel to win her hand"" unless there's a specific arrangement that she will unquestioningly go with the winner."
