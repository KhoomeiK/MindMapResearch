insomnia,ffp51v9,t3_eua6bd,1580086381.0,Me. I can’t sleep during the day unless I drink till I pass out
bipolar,ffp4zf6,t3_eualu3,1580086334.0,I’m bipolar 1 and was no good unmedicated in a relationship.
bipolar,ffm96fm,t1_ffm7uqb,1580050792.0,Omg mine was taller than me by a good foot and a half Hahahaha. It’s like a day long project
insomnia,ffm7jre,t1_ffm6ced,1580049801.0,"I don’t really have too much of an issue with feeling tired in the middle of the day. I mean I have in the past, but currently, after one cup of coffee I’m good to go no matter how little sleep I got. I just took 75mg of pregabalin a few minutes ago actually (it’s just shy of 7am here). I get a couple yawns mid afternoon usually but I feel like that’s to do with my other medication. Either way I’m not scared of a little grogginess, it’s a nice respite from going full steam ahead all day long, but thank you for the heads up. Honestly that gives me hope that it might be able to help me nap too, I’ve not been able to do that for about a decade with the exception of two days about a month ago. I’m most definitely going to look into higher doses like 300mg at a time. I found some people taking 600mg a day for anxiety."

bipolar,ffm65qt,t3_eu6wlr,1580049220.0,"Working all day again, but it’s my Friday. I plan on getting into some good video games and puppy cuddles after work. Then I’m spending my weekend going to three different doctor’s appointments (I’m putting my insurance to work now that I have it again) and doing some shopping therapy to the tune of buying some snow skis."
bipolar,ffm5w26,t3_eu7939,1580049063.0,I would not. Kids are awful and I wouldn’t recommend arming your classmates with such ammunition against you
insomnia,ffm3inm,t1_ffktq22,1580047922.0,"Alright that is so good to hear. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist Tuesday and will ask about upping the pregabalin for sleep as well. When I was originally on gabapentin the script was for anxiety and deep sleep promotion so it makes sense that pregabalin should also promote deep sleep. I’ve taken a few days off so I should have enough to try a larger dose tonight. Zolpidem literally does absolutely nothing to me, it doesn’t even make me feel funny. I ended up taking Seroquel last night and it was a bunch of broken sleep but sleep nonetheless. I’m hoping the pregabalin in combo with eszopiclone will be enough to get me a good night’s sleep. Thank you for the info"
bipolar,ffjxoak,t1_ffjtp6q,1580009800.0,"Which ones? I take Magnesium Malate, Magtein, 5HTP, a b complex, adult multivitamin, D3, Melatonin and Valerian Root"
bipolar,ffjufxc,t3_eu0ryd,1580007252.0,"5 but two are PRN. Lithium and Pregabalin for mood stabilizers, eszopiclone for sleep, quetiapine as needed for mania and clonazepam as needed for anxiety. Honestly I don’t see the need to take an antipsychotic everyday and if you feel the same way speak up to your doctor about it"
insomnia,ffjneqc,t1_ffjn6iy,1580002281.0,I stopped taking it. It caused a few other problems for me too. I take eszopiclone to sleep now

bipolar,ffjhdhw,t3_ets7hl,1579998265.0,I got a note taker assigned in each class so I could pay more attention to the lecture
bipolar,ffjgv8i,t3_etrcbh,1579997968.0,I’ve been peeing every fifteen minutes sometimes. I’ve been drinking lots of water though
