This is a way to ""neg"" people - make it seem not that bad on their own, but over so many conversations it just makes her look like she can't focus on anything else and she does it to wear you down. Negging is usually talked about in a dating sense but it works in friendships too.

In my experience half-assedly agreeing with negative people will take the wind out of her sails.

Her: ""My boyfriend is happy when I don't wear makeup...""        
You: ""Yeah guys can be funny like that when they think their preferences should dictate what women do.""

Her: \*inspects your face for makeup\*      
You: \*slowly slink out of her gaze with a ""WTF are you doing"" look\*

Her: \*points to me and was like ""she wears lots of makeup""\*

Additionally, nuclear families are getting smaller and there are fewer relatives around to help with baby care nowadays. Americans tend to move away from grandparents that would otherwise help with care (usually grandma), so new parents are often left feeling like they have no support. Also from the grandparents perspective, a lot of older people, especially women, still need to work and aren't around to be assumed child care even if they do live in the area and even want to watch their grandchild.
