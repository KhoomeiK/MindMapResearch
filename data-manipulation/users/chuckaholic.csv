AMA,ffsugxz,t3_euyq25,1580192940.0,I did the same thing when I was 18. I had a 1985 Caprice Classic. I was actually comfy to sleep in. Big seats. I was in there for about a month and I was able to find a roommate that let me move in so we could split rent on a 1 bedroom. I was working fast food and could barely afford it at the time. I can't imagine trying to do that now. Rent has tripled and minimum wage has only increased like 10%. I guess people are sleeping 4 people to a 1 bedroom.

If your Roomba is dying before cleaning the whole house, maybe you could have 2 of them and split the work load. Even when factoring in the time I spend doing maintenance on the Roomba, my time saved is much greater. And my house stays a lot cleaner than if I only used the broom and upright vacuum."

Make a list of a few things you are interested in. Join facebook groups, subscribe to subreddits, get on Meetup.com. Find out when their events happen and show up. Talk to people. Just walk in and say hi to the first people you see. Ask them if they are there for the meetup, they will say 'yes'. Ask if you can sit with them. They will say 'yes'. Once you have a seat, start asking questions pertaining to the topic at hand. ""What video games are y'all playing?"", ""What sports team will make it to the playoffs?"", ""What's your favorite boat?"". Eventually after asking several questions, you will be able to make a contribution to the conversation with a related anecdote. Then ask more questions. Wait for other people to talk. Act interested in what people say. Find and highlight similarities with the other people, ""I have that same model of X... Have you noticed that it sometimes is slow starting up?"" At the end of the meetup, find someone you particularly clicked with and ask them if you can add them on Facebook or other social media. Find out when the next meetup will be and ask people if they will come to the next one. Go to every meetup. Be active on the social media platform. Comment and like on lots of stuff. 

Laugh at people's jokes. Don't be the guy just waiting for someone else to finish talking just so you can tell your story, ask about details of the story they just told, ""When you said you met Patrick Swayze, did you actually chill with him for an evening or was it a quick meet and greet and goodbye?"" People like it when you listen to them, so asking for details of a story they just told lets them know you are interested. Don't say things that are too shocking just to get a reaction. Don't try to change the subject unless there is a natural segway. When people are telling their stories, react with ""that's funny"" or ""wow I wouldn't expect that"". Let them know you enjoyed their story. 

Sometimes groups that are already established will have one or two 'influencers' that seem to be the most popular. These people have very high social intuition and make friends easily. Focus on them. Even if you are awkward and shy, you can still make friends with them because they will make it easy for you. lean on them to help you meet others and they will try to integrate you into the group because they are super-social and they almost feel a need to do this. 

After a few meetups, you will probably have clicked with someone more than the others. Now focus on them. See if they would like to meet up somewhere outside the group environment. Maybe you have a common interest with them that is not the focus of the initial group. If you are in a bass fishing group and find that another member and yourself both love playing drums, find out if they would like to go to Guitar Center sometime. Or pull them into a drumming group that you are in. Become the 'influencer'.

[EDIT] Almost forgot. Be super careful not to offend anyone. This might be difficult because offence is taken, not given, but do your best. I think about it this way, If I have a comment I want to make about a person of group I ask myself if I would still make that comment if they were sitting right next to me. If the answer is no then I don't make that comment. 

Offending someone in the group might ruin your chance to be their friend and could even sabotage future friendships because if people find you offensive, they will warn others to avoid you. This is very important!"

I did intermittent fasting for some of it. I did exercise during some of it. My normal meals were chicken, fish, or chicken for protein ( about 80-100 grams per day) and a LOT of green veggies. No bread, no sugar (obviously). I drink diet soda (I like Coke Zero and Diet Dr Pepper) Coffee with splenda. Atkins makes a frozen dinner that is low carb and 400~ish calories. That's good for work lunches. 

I went from 365 to [220](https://imgur.com/J1aFYy7). I gained 30 pounds over the holidays and just got back serious again a few days ago. This time around I won't be trying to meet a weight goal, I am focusing on losing 1% body fat per month and I should be at 17% by December. I'm at 28% right now. 

By the way, my blood work was really bad when I was at 365. I was pre-diabetic. Cholesterol, everything was bad. Within a few months my blood work was pretty much normal even though I hadn't lost much weight at that point. 

I know there are some anti-keto people in every weight loss community but I swear by it because it worked for me. I recommend the [2 Keto Dudes Podcast](http://2ketodudes.com/show.aspx?episode=11). It breaks it down simply but also goes into technical detail. Like I said, the best diet is the one you can stick to, and for me, keto was awesome because the food is delicious and filling. I don't feel like I'm eating rabbit food and keto is better than most diets about letting you feel like you've had a substantial meal even though you are restricting calories.

So, I can see your heart is in the right place here. I want to say 2 things. 

1. The best diet is one that you can stick with. I was obese for most of my life. I tried many diets that didn't work because I was always hungry or it was too difficult. The one that ended up being successful was the one I could follow every day. 

2. Exercise for fitness, diet for weight control. If you main health issues are caused by obesity, exercise should not be a priority. I lost 130 pounds before I started exercising. I'm not saying to not do it, I'm just saying diet is the key. Exercise is a bonus. 

After having said both of those things, I lost 145 pounds eating high salt, high fat, lots of vegetables (they are delicious if you cook them right), protein every day (except when fasting), very little exercise, fast food sometimes (usually heavily modified from the menu to meet my macros) and pre-packaged food when I needed to."

I was a technical MOS and it was my job to solve problems, but then you can't do anything outside the SOP so most shit never got fixed. It was just frustrating. I think I might have done better in another branch. Marines are probably way too chaotic for my taste and I've heard that navy enlisted never sleep at all, fuck that lol. Maybe Air Force would have been a better fit, but who knows. I have a friend in the Air Force and she is a hot mess and they haven't kicked her out. I think they have a higher tolerance for certain things but you have to fit their mold. A Benning infantryman might be completely outside their idea of what an effective soldier is, lol."
MilitaryStories,fe02efe,t3_enaayv,1578801364.0,"I went to basic at Ft Benning. They are really high speed - low drag there. Apparently one of the drills fucked up real bad. I had fucked up too and I was doing some bullshit detail like policing the grass. Anyway, his punishment was to report to me and I was ordered to be in charge of him and make him do whatever detail I was currently doing. Imagine my fear knowing this guy was going to be smoking me tomorrow. He was a total bro about it and told me not to worry, and he was there because he fucked up. He did end up smoking me a few more times during basic but I don't think it was more than I deserved."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fe01c09,t1_fdyol27,1578800638.0,"A friend of mine has a kid with some pretty obvious special needs. He has behavior issues, learning disability, and several other health and mental issues. He started kindergarten this year and the teachers and administrators have tried to get her to agree to put him in special ed and she completely refuses to do it. He desperately needs it but she refuses to believe that he is abnormal. So he disrupts the class on a daily basis. Takes up all the teacher's time. It's a shitshow, but it's ultimately her decision until he does something serious enough to get kicked out."

sysadmin,fdzxe61,t3_enbaxw,1578798122.0,I'd be glad to sign any non compete agreement as long as it includes binding legal language that stipulates that my new employer can't hire any technicians other than me for the duration of my employment and for a year after I leave their company.
borderlands3,fdzwa19,t1_fdlfzvp,1578797324.0,"Thanks for the info. I just started the DLC so I will be looking for that class mod. Starting off with Amara because she is easy mode and I want to absorb the story first, then I'll do it with the rest of them in progressively harder mayhems. By the time I do Zane last, I'll prob have the Seein' Dead."
borderlands3,fdle727,t1_fdl3ako,1578522115.0,"I haven't fgured out Zane yet. All 3 other characters I have OP builds where they melt faces, but on Zane I've tried cryo zane but his shield won't stay up. I've tried a kill skill Zane but I run out of ammo with Lyuda and it's half Traunt's shield. He just seems so weak compared to the other characters. I still want to do a TVHM run in M4 with him like I did with the others but I can't find a viable build."
AskMen,fdjtvw7,t3_ellzke,1578487326.0,"I got jock itch for the first time in my late 30's about a week after ending a long dry spell. I'd never had jock itch despite having played football and been in the military. I legit thought she gave me an STD. Went to the doc and they had me tested to be sure. What a relief. 

Another time I started getting intense headaches in the middle of a masturbation sesh, killing the mood instantly. As I was in a multi-year dry spell, and had some health issues that was making it difficult to get erections, I thought my sex life was over before I hit 40. Cue intense depression. Thanklfully my doc got me some blood pressure pills and now everything is back to normal."
loseit,fdin381,t1_fdi67gr,1578446591.0,"Interesting take on keto, there. Some links to other articles that make claims, then link to other articles that don't support those claims, even more links to some people quoted making statements that are patently false. All the while exclaiming that it's not sustainable! But the [actual research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2716748/) says the opposite. During my foray into keto I found more hit-pieces like these than I found actual helpful articles. When you start reading the dozens of actual research papers, all the criticism falls away. The scientists are telling us it's healthy, the journalists are telling us it's not."

loseit,fdgj843,t3_ekuulp,1578399024.0,"Surprising keto is considered controversial. It's been around since Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution was published in 1972. It was effective then just as a modern keto diet is now. And don't start with the ""it's not healthy for long term"" because I've been on it for 5 years and I'm healthier now than I ever have been. Ask my doctor."

I lost over 100 pounds and I thought I would get a lot more attention from women being thin, but it turns out that really didn't change much. A few nights ago, after months of being thin, an attractive girl told me that I was very handsome. Man, I felt fantastic for like 2 whole days.
