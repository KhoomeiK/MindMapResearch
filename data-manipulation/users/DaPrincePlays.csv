YangForPresidentHQ,ff2s7k9,t1_ff2ryqp,1579521851.0,"If you feel like insulting people deters them from being assholes in the future, I would have to disagree. I stopped insulting you because I didn't want to spread more negativity not because you ""beat"" me. I don't think there is a winner in insults it belittles only the two involved. I guess that is a difference in philosophy.


So if you stated no facts how did you counter my points with ""facts and logic""? Its a rhetorical question by the way. Though feel free to answer it. 



It's getting late and I finished my paper while replying to you. It was an entertaining conversation so thanks. I got to go to work at 8 and it's already 4 am... Good night, though perhaps maybe good morning to you."
YangForPresidentHQ,ff2rr2n,t1_ff2re5f,1579521226.0,"I actually editted my insults out right away and apologized, I was hotheaded after a previous incident. However I fail to see why you would stoop to that level as well. Though I guess I can't fault you for that as I would be a hypocrite. So my apologies.

An eye for an eye doesn't help anyone, though I guess you are a bit too emotionally riled up to think clearly at the moment. 

Though if it makes you feel better, feel free to continue insulting me barring death threats as those are a bit too extreme. I don't mind you letting off steam :)


Further, I dont recall getting ""destroyed"" by facts and logic as you are merely stating opinions after opinions. Also, perhaps you forgot because of your drowsiness but I did not orignally reply to you, rather someone else."
YangForPresidentHQ,ff2r6ox,t1_ff2r0gl,1579520423.0,"How did I ""fuck up""? I never told you to stop insulting me, I don't personally care if you make a fool of yourself. 


Also if you don't watch the daily show why are you so imvested in a thread about the show? Maybe you should take a shower and think about it. Maybe have a friend read it, a fresh perspective is good once in a while. Cheers mate, maybe loosen those panties a bit though.

To be clear, I apologized because it was the right thing to do, not because I felt bad for what I said. We don't need more insults in the world and I'll be the better person. So have a good day and don't let a stranger with a different opinion get you wound up."
YangForPresidentHQ,ff2qnng,t1_ff2pn3q,1579519657.0,"Who said I hated Trump or that I loved him? The original comment stated their complaint about why the president is mentioned so often. You're pushing a narrative on what I'm saying. If you want to have a good day and not see the news on the president then just don't read political news or watch political shows. It's not hard.


Also to address some things:

1. I'm not a liberal, I'm a moderate with some conservative values. I did not vote in the 2016. Though I'm a registered democrat to vote for Yang.

2. While I disagree with the Trump administration I don't quote ""you hate trump so much it makes me an imbecile""

3. I'm not obsessed about Trump, I hardly care for the man but he is the center of American poltics, that's a fact not an opinion. Talking about American poltics will involve politicians. Go watch John Oliver if you want to hear about other problems, that's not a poltical show.

4. If you want to have a good day don't browse politcal subreddits.

5. The daily show is an American politcal commentary show therefore it reports on the center of American politics. If you go to their youtibe channel most of their videos is actually not about Trump.

6. I Also don't watch the daily show except the occasional youtube video.


 Have a good day, pro tip: stay away from American politics if you want to not hear about Trump."

YangForPresidentHQ,ff2pffp,t1_ff2p4v8,1579517830.0,"Just a week ago we were on a brink of war. News pretty much took a short break after christmas but the week before was the impeachment. And before that was the hearings. Not to mention all the small stuff that happens inbetween like selling saudi troops and withdrawing from Iran. Oh how about trump response on the saudi soldier killing americans?


He's the center of politics it would be idiotic to not report/talk about him. Youre wrong, if he got talked about less he gets away with more. We don't only talk about him, we also talk about the senate and congress. But Trump is the center of attention because he holds the cards.


Issues like poverty/welfare/automation won't matter if the people in charge don't care. The people dont hold the power"

YangForPresidentHQ,ff221cj,t1_ff20497,1579491677.0,America has huge influence on the world whether of not that is a good thing or not is personal opinion. Though I believe it isn't. The president is therefore one of the most influential people alive and one of the most important. A political show not talking about him often is not called a politcal show.
