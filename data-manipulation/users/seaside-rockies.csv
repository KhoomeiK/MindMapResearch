ColoradoRockies,ffb8a86,t1_ffb4cyl,1579754757.0,I feel bad for him. That’s gotta be a little awkward in the club house.
politics,ffaxjk8,t1_ffamzp5,1579746806.0,Yes. He is more proud of his gamesmanship than what is right.

Braves,ff89qug,t1_ff7peiw,1579670203.0,Found it. Braves lose third highest selection and $500k of international money. [Link](https://www.mlb.com/news/marcell-ozuna-deal-with-braves)
baseball,ff7t89m,t1_ff7szb0,1579657790.0,True and trash pandas

baseball,ff7oxvy,t1_ff7lxrg,1579654800.0,Going to [leave this list of milb team names here.](https://www.milb.com/about/teams) Norwich sea unicorns is probably my favorite.
Braves,ff7mow7,t1_ff7l6wh,1579653222.0,"The Braves gave Josh Donaldson one, so good pretty sure they cancel out. Otherwise would have cost a draft pick."
rugbyunion,ff370rz,t3_erdvv5,1579535202.0,Love to see it.

ColoradoRockies,feig90q,t1_fei8225,1579137819.0,"Pessimist fan reason is the Desmond, Shaw, McGee, and Davis contracts hamstrung the org preventing us from having a productive offseason. Since we have taken zero steps to improve, may as well try and start over. However, the reason to me is writers need article clicks. I highly doubt anyone would give us the return Nolan is worth given the opt out in his contract."
baseball,fdpyajl,t1_fdoa81z,1578645742.0,It was weird then and weirder now.
baseball,fdpy5pu,t1_fdogvu3,1578645560.0,"Yep. Shaw, McGee, and Davis"
politics,fdm506a,t1_fdlziob,1578539941.0,Ok that does make since. It certainly didn’t help stabilization and I agree about the allies thing. I wonder how much Trump seeing how unsupported he is stopped him from going further. Like he was one of the baddies in that interaction.
politics,fdlutpc,t1_fdlu1s1,1578533012.0,"I agree! I hate the guy and wish we hadn’t left the original deal with Iran, but this is good. In fact pretty well played. He killed their general, called their bluff on retaliation, no Americans dead and adding more sanctions (which at this point doesn’t really move the needle much to my understanding).  So he got to make his point with minimum collateral damage. What’s bad here about the final resolution?"

politics,fdfevw7,t1_fder35k,1578360069.0,"Honestly given how loopy that party is, seeing a rationalization helps understand how to deal with it. Actual random chaos is hard, people with a mission is easier to deal with I think, you can better predict their actions knowing their reasons."
