ComputerEngineering,ffc9e9z,t1_ffc04b8,1579794534.0,"Hmm, okay. My apologies."
ComputerEngineering,ffbczx1,t1_ffbcev9,1579760164.0,"I don’t acknowledge it being a problem for me, personally. Even if it was a problem, it’s one without an answer, so simply moving along with your day wouldn’t amount to ignorance I don’t think. I’ve just seen too many people suffering for me to invest too much time into obsessing over the fact that because we are all little meat bags walking around with our organic computer brains, we are unable to experience what the person next to us experiences, and because of that they aren’t having an experience? I don’t believe in that. When you see people in emotional agony, my whole being believes they feel it, just like when you read the word agony, I know you’ve felt it. Can we prove it at this point in time, to a degree at which would be undeniable? No, I don’t know that we ever could. But we go by faith on a lot more things than we realize. I suppose it comes down to personal philosophy at that point."
ComputerEngineering,ffbc0mj,t1_ffbbrmg,1579759098.0,"I don’t know how I’ve come off as ignorant, but I actually have had existential obsessive compulsive disorder off and on since childhood, and I’ve been down many a rabbit hole. I definitely agree ruminating upon things which have no answer can be damaging and unproductive in one’s own life, I know from first hand experience."
ComputerEngineering,ffbbrya,t1_ffbbhmn,1579758844.0,"Oh yeah, that’s pretty much the conclusion I’ve come to. Way too many assumptions being made, to the point where you may as well just speculate all day about any manner of things, such as the Big Bang came from a inter-dimensional unicorn farting. My apologies if this is posted frequently here, I am still somewhat new to Reddit."
ComputerEngineering,ffbb7gb,t1_ffbaxbo,1579758241.0,"Why be careful? I understand what solipsism is, and that one cannot prove another’s existence beyond your own. But I think it’s bullshit, my own experience of other people having experiences is evidence enough for me. I’m not sure what there is to be careful of."
bathandbodyworks,ff9drcv,t3_esb3hb,1579710801.0,I just assumed that this wouldn’t be allowed. BBW should not allow seasonal clearance sale items to be exchanged for new items. I wouldn’t blame them for putting a stop to that.

Art,fekskk7,t1_fekr9gk,1579206725.0,"It’s pretty revealing of your own apathy that you’re so suspicious of people’s motives. Rather than believing the tragic death of billions of animals could affect someone so much they created a piece of art to express how they feel about it, you think they must just want to get cheap upvotes from it."
trashy,feith6z,t1_feit4wo,1579146781.0,"Yes, I made the point about type 1 being transferable by oral sex in my previous comment, and I also said people who have it shouldn’t be ashamed. Simply warning people to take precautions and not to take health risks lightly doesn’t create stigma."
trashy,fein8de,t1_fei981h,1579142485.0,"There’s different kinds of herpes. Herpes type 1, this is what most people have. This is the one that causes cold sores. Most people don’t have herpes type 2, the type that appears on the genitals, thighs, and anus. Also, if you have a cold sore and give oral sex, you can transfer it to that person’s genitals. While I don’t think people who have it should be ashamed, it’s not pleasant and not to be taken lightly."

vegan,fdvyk4z,t3_en0s49,1578753188.0,"It’s a lot easier to be nihilistic, criticize everything, and to come up with excuses to keep things going the way they are. When you start actually caring about things, you have to accept personal responsibility, and that’s a hard thing to do."
Mindfulness,fds14sq,t1_fds11v8,1578692685.0,Thank you very much!

Mindfulness,fdqfv4i,t1_fdqfmls,1578665619.0,"If you search “Banlana paint by numbers Poppy Field” it should come up on Amazon. One comes with a frame and is more expensive, and one is just the canvas. Thank you!"

Mindfulness,fdpkl1s,t1_fdphz7z,1578631199.0,Mandalas are fun! & very pretty when they’re finished. Takes a bit of patience though the more intricate they are.
Mindfulness,fdpkfyw,t1_fdpk6k5,1578631084.0,"I do the exact same thing! I’m hoping the more I practice maybe I’ll start feeling a little adventurous with the painting, but I’m my own harshest critic. Cross stitching sounds nice, I might have to look into it."
Mindfulness,fdpjykj,t1_fdpjljs,1578630687.0,"Yes! I was actually thinking that I’d like to delve into it further. I just tend to think everything I draw or paint is crappy, at least this way with the numbers it comes out pretty regardless."
vegan,fdpjh56,t1_fdpibhe,1578630297.0,"This is good information, thanks again. I’m going to come back to your comment when I go grocery shopping and make sure I pick that stuff up."

Mindfulness,fdpcs5b,t3_emkto0,1578625368.0,"I’m not the most artistic person, but this paint by numbers canvas I got for Christmas was a great thing for me to do whenever I had some free time after work, on the weekends, or whenever I was by myself. If you’re interested the canvases are available on Amazon, some of them are less than $20. I have trouble keeping my mind from wandering, this helped keep me occupied."
ThriftStoreHauls,fdoqfzq,t1_fdnrcnh,1578610541.0,Like a tolchock to the yarbles?
vegan,fdo4r65,t1_fdo3ifs,1578598883.0,"Yes, I recently looked into the dairy industry and found it’s just as abhorrent. One could argue that in some ways it’s worse than the meat industry in the sense that before the animals are killed, they’re first harvested for their milk and eggs. If I really allow myself to think about it, I spiral with anxiety. But it’s that cognitive dissonance that kept me stuck where I was until I finally decided enough was enough, there’s no excuses I can make anymore. Anyway, thank you for the support!"
vegan,fdo3xdn,t1_fdo3h55,1578598444.0,Thank you very much!
vegan,fdo1g30,t1_fdo0d6n,1578597128.0,"I looked up Instant Pot and I thought it was like a crock pot but I guess it’s faster? I’ll have to look into to getting one, I love black beans and rice. I’m not too big a meat eater to be honest, it’s just laziness and not planning my meals properly so I’ll grab fast food or something. So honestly, I think even if I just switch to a lazy vegan diet it’ll be an improvement."
vegan,fdo0bq2,t1_fdo03zf,1578596490.0,Neat! That’s great because I live nearest to a Wal-Mart in my little town. Good stuff.

vegan,fdnxznt,t1_fdnxfnt,1578595135.0,"Yeah I don’t know why, I was under the impression to do it “properly” it’d have to look like an Instagram video or something with lots of different ingredients and stuff. I guess the point that matters is stopping the meat and dairy, going cruelty free, and taking it from there? Thank you!"
vegan,fdnxgrk,t1_fdnwmqj,1578594826.0,"That’s truly awesome advice, thank you very much."
vegan,fdnwwv6,t1_fdnwihh,1578594505.0,"Yeah I’m learning that quickly. I don’t know why I had it built up in my head as something so hard to do. At the same time, I’m sure to be a clean eater and very healthy does take hard work and discipline. I’m just looking to take the first step, the prepackaged stuff will probably be my best bet."
vegan,fdnwm3n,t1_fdnvtc0,1578594332.0,Cool! That sounds doable.
