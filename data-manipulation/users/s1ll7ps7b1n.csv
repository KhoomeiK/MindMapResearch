insaneparents,ffh7oae,t1_ffh7hi1,1579925442.0,"Someone on imgur removed it. My friend in the post said it probably is for a good reason so I likely wont reupload. But it was the typical ""god and grandpa hate you for taking it up the ass"" and my buddy cheekily replied ""*oh mom you dont have to be a bottom to be bi*"" and she rages. That part, that got me a good little chuckle. I hate watching parents destroy their bond with flesh and blood over something so menial as sexuality"

insaneparents,ffh6stt,t1_ffh58to,1579924712.0,Hes surrounded by a far stronger friends group that loves and accepts him happily.

Which is a different, equally self destructive mindset. Cause it encourages you to not give a damn about anything or anyone and certainly not yourself. 

All I've ascertained in my brief time in this world which may very well be a simulation, is lifes purpose is to be happy and enjoy our time while we can. So, go grab life by the dick and fuck it"
