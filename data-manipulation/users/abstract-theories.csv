AskReddit,fevkkr9,t1_feujcke,1579398495.0,"I called the cops on a cat. Something was scratching at the window directly behind our couch around 2 am (yay insomnia). I refused to open the curtains to look, and instead phoned 911. After they searched the perimeter of our house and started walking to their cars, I walked outside only to be “attacked” by a stray. Super embarrassing."
