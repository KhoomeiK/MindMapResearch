JustDance,ffnw5vc,t3_eubiwe,1580071505.0,"Also, if you purchase a kinect. It it much cheaper to get a gently used one from game stop for $49. You will need to get an adapter for the xbox one as the kinect was for the previous xbox model. Amazon sells them for $25. Or if you have patience, buying the kinect and then sending the info to Microsoft. They will send you one for free (the adapter).

I got a kinect for jd2020 for my xbox one and loveeeeee it!"

AnimalsBeingBros,ff7s2k0,t1_ff7qlts,1579656985.0,"Its wonderful. Very smart creatures. We got 2 for a child in our family and obviously had to take care of them bc kids are kids.. I got attached quick.. unlike hamsters or gerbils. Pee wee herman and lalloyd have never bit us.. they are smart, come when called, know their names, and have personalities all of their own. Unfortunately, they dont live forever.. 1 of our ratties (lalloyd) is almost 3  1/2 yrs old and it looks like its about his time. Im devastated but am happy we gave him a great life bc usually 2 yrs is the life span."
