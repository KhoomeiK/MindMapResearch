I'm sorry for what you are going through. Nobody deserves to be abused in the work place. 

Unfortunately, if you went into social work, you will find more of the same thing happening. And social workers don't get paid as much RNs.

I know nursing is a stressful job and perhaps you are burnt out and just need a creative outlet do destress? 

Before going for a full career change, I would suggest you try making time for yourself and doing something creative. Maybe starting a blog about mental health or learning a new musical instrument?"

Your TFSA limit is increased the next year by the amount that you withdrew from your TFSA.

For example if you maxed out your TFSA limit of $34k and grew it to $500k. If you withdrew the $500k, your deposit limit the next year would also increase by $500k.

When you're in cold water on the other hand, most of the heat transfer from your body to the water is due to convection.

In general convection transfer heats between to objects faster than conduction.

Also due to the properties of water, it has a higher heat transfer coefficient that air. This means that water transfers heat faster air."

1) Trading comissions and other fees (eg. account maintainence fees, foreign transaction fees, transfer fees)

2) The level of service that a brokerage provide. 

3) Having a user friendly trading platform, that you could access on your web browser or through a mobile app.

Many people recommend going with Questrade because they are the first discount broker in Canada that lets you buy ETFs for free. So far, my experience with their customer service has been good. Their trading platform both on the browser and mobile app is easy to use. 

Questrade does charge you a commission if you are selling an ETF or if you buy or sell stocks. They also require an initial deposit of $1000. They might also charge an account inactivity fee if your account drops below $1000 and you don't make a trade in a certain time.

Wealthsimple Trade is a new brokerage that started recently. They don't charge any commissions when you buy or sell stocks.  They do not require any minimum balance and can start with as little as $1.

They are only available on mobile so you won't be able to access their trading platform through your browser.

Suppose you drink to cups of tea a day. One before work and one after work. So you'll need hot water in the morning and the evening.

There are two things you can do to have hot water in the evening.

1) You could have a ""smart"" kettle that maintains the water you've boiled in the morning at 100C, while you're at work for 8 hours.

2) Or you could let the water you boiled in the morning cool down. And boil it again when you come home in the evening.

In scenario 1, the power you use to maintain the water at 100C is equal to the heat loss over 8 hours.

In scenario 2, the power you use is the energy needed to heat the water from room temperature to boiling.

The longer your kettle is turned off in scenario 2, the more energy you save.

Btw, you're also right that a greater difference between outdoor and indoor temperature affects how much energy is loss."

I don't know what will happen 50-60 years from now. It could very well be that a new set of developed countries with better economic growth have emerged. It'll be up to my grandchildren and great grandchildren to evaluate what's going on and decide the best investments for them.

As for me, by that time I might be in my last few years of life, if I'm even still alive. I can only make do with what I know now. That is economic growth and political stability are corellated somehow.

Not saying that it doesn't happen on developed countries, but in many developing countries, corruption is the expectation and not the exception. The political elites with power and influence will want a slice of the pie before they approve any licenses or permits projects.

If you cross the wrong person an make an ""politically incorrect"" statement or action, the elites will have the power to shut you down. (Literally politically incorrect as in saying anything the political elites think will threaten their political power. eg. China cancelling projects and banning events)

The protests in Hong Kong and Iran shows that many ordinary citizens in those countries want change. But it'll be decades before any real change will happen.
