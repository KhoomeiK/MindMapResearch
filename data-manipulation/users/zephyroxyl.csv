In 2015 he was ranting and raving about how smoking doesn't harm anyone and that smokers ""aren't at any more risk than people that eat carrots.""

And he vehemently believed that second-hand smoke doesn't have any effect on bystander's health.

So, Reddit hates him for being a total piece of shit and because he was wilfully and knowingly spreading incorrect information re smoking and second hand smoke. 

Maybe the lung cancer will change his tune. Probably not, though."

If a Christian was doing this (I'm from Northern Ireland, I've already dealt with this bs from hard-line Christians), I'd be saying the same thing: Fuck off to a Christian majority country that hates the LGBT. 

It's not hard to be tolerant of people's religion so long as they don't hate others. Pretty simple. 

Also, by gender politics, I assume you're talking about transgenderism, which is backed by science.

So get fucked, concern troll."
unitedkingdom,fgiur06,t1_fgis05u,1580831345.0,"As he said: they are free to practice their religion. 

The UK is officially secular and as such, someone's religious beliefs shouldn't have a bearing on the curriculum. 

If they are so against teaching kids ""gay people exist and that's okay"", they can leave. 

There are plenty of Muslims who don't hold these bigoted views. It's not an issue of religion, it's an issue of bigotry. 

The same for Christians, Jews, Hindus etc etc. You've got the people who go, ""yeah that bit about gay people being sinners is a load of bollocks"" and you've got people like this guy.

thatHappened,fghgaer,t1_fgh9768,1580784160.0,"No.

Reductive amination is one method: A high school chemistry lab will not have phenylacetone or methylamine. Phenylacetone is a restricted substance due to its use in meth cooking, high school labs have no use for methylamine. 

There's another method but it uses similar reagents, and a high school lab won't have those either. 

Hell, you'd be hard pressed to find the stuff in a level 1 or level 2 university lab. For a simple synthesis that is. 

Edit: To do it from the things in a high school lab or chemicals you can buy from a shop, you need to do a long, complicated multi-stage synthesis with many more compounds."

Have you used their mLink app? Total pile of shite. My route is the 15/215. Just the way my schedule lines up, I get the Goldlines, generally. 

Now, I would buy my ticket for the 215 using the app, show my phone to the driver and that would be fine. Don't get my y-link discount despite linking my card up but whatever. 

Few days ago, I needed to get a standard 15. Start walking to the bus stop, pull up the app to buy my ticket. Click into the Ulsterbus section of the app and... No 15. Nope. 

The only Ulsterbus service is Craigavon. Sprint to the shop to use their cash machine, sprint back to the bus stop, bus passes me on my way there and I miss it. 

Nice. 

They should just put actual NFC card readers on a the busses. It would make life so much easier. But that'd be too 2010s, I guess."
