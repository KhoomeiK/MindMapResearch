Id argue that in game character interactions are less likely to have much of an impact on younger people, unless its a very quotable line that just gets repeated over and over, ""War, war never changes"" as an example. What would (and from my experience does) get younger people, and odler sadly, to act like complete shit heads is the online portions of games, where youre granted anonymity to be a shit head, and the community is often built around that and getting under peoples skin by trash talking and trolling, and this is especially prevalent in more competitive based games (Rainbow six, LoL, OW, etc.) where it just feeds into it self. Do good? Shit talk the other team, get enjoyment out of their ""tears"", farm more. Do bad? Shit talk your team mates for being so bad AND the enemy team for being try hards. And then since no one knows who you are, you feel like you have free reign to say what ever shit you want to get the biggest reaction out of people. Then add streamer personalities ontop of that and you get a big gaggle of shit heads, around another shit head, in a community of shit heads, all trying to out shit head each other. 

Now, since certain issues are becoming a hot topic of discussion these days, with certain groups of people known to get set off easily, say, womens rights, you get people that are trying to outshit head each other that will go ""hurr durr back in the kitchen"" even if theyd never say anything like that IRL since they know itll be a quick way to harvest salt. Otherwise, wed have a massive issue due to all the games that have copious amounts of fan service, or violence, etc."

gaming,ff4g08t,t1_ff49rar,1579562711.0,"Heres the thing, yes women play video games, but the primary demographic of the big names games isnt women, its men, aged 15-35, and just like pretty much any other product in existence, sex sells. And yes, plenty of guys like women being in functional suits of armor (for fantasy games at least, probably wouldnt make sense for star dew valley) but when a large part of your primary audience is a bunch of horny guys, sometimes the plate bikini is picked.

At the same time, guys get portrayed like looking like [testosterone fueled engines of weight lifting that look like they chug steroids for breakfast and have at least 5% silverback gorilla DNA](https://img1.looper.com/img/gallery/the-entire-gears-of-war-story-explained/intro-1563996350.jpg). So we get games that often portray male characters as badasses that look like they hunt T-rexes with their bare hands, and sexy women that are also badasses with their asses freezing in the breeze, both things that most guys A) Dont look like, and B) dont have in their lives respectively, outside of their forms of escapism. Thats also not including the women who want to play as a sexy badass because in real life they arent some assassin that wears shitty form fitting leather ""armor"" (if you can call it that) and survives fights with mythical beasts but instead just work shitty jobs like everyone else. 

Should there be more games that have women like say, Cassandra from Dragon Age or the new laura Croft where they understand how to dress themselves for combat and exploring rather than going to a sexy LARP event? Sure. Hell, make games where the women look like the sisters of Dom and Marcus from Gears of War, make a game with a dude who wears whats essentially a BDSM suit and calls it armor as well. Absolutely there should.

But also saying that the fantasy of a markets primary demographic is an issue, like in the video the picture is from, is ""problematic"" is sort of ridiculous. Itd be like saying that any market that is female dominated has an issue since it appeals to womens fantasies more. Quick shitty example would be men coming along and saying that Romance Novels (one of the best selling genres) where something like 86% of the market is women, should change because the focus on womens fantasies being so prevalent in it is an issue because of X Y and Z reasons. For some specific points I'd like to address though, lets start with this.

&#x200B;

> If a person wants to play a game strictly because they can punch  suffragettes in the face or bed women... That's a lot different than  enjoying a game for it's content. 

No body has said they want to play a game for reasons like that, outside of horny kids first learning about GTA and going ""holy shit, sex is in this? I want to play that! thats so cool!"" or someone on twitter saying it because they know itll bother people, because frankly, seeing people lose their shit on twitter over absolutely dumb things can be pretty funny even though its also disappointing for our species.

&#x200B;

> In addition, not all women want to be support classes. It's difficult  when you're playing and you continuously get talked over or dismissed  then the team wipes because they didn't pay attention.  

True, but that first part is mostly a meme now left over from ye olde days where a ton of girls are brought into games like WoW for example by their SO who was was already playing a tank or DPSer and felt like he could talk his girlfriend into being his pocket healer, because everyone loves having their own personal healer. Outside of that, say for D&D, ive seen women be some of the most bloodthirsty players at a table for example. None of this to discount the ones who like playing healers though because we should all love our healers more than we do.

That leads me into the next bit, being dismissed by people when they fuck up? Thats because most people dont like admitting (or being told) that they fucked up, it must be someone elses fault. Back to an MMO example, ive seen it happen all the time, DPS or Tank does dumb shit, gets them selves killed, and blame the healer. Why? Because the tanks generally eat crayons (ala the Destiny joke carried over from the military that titans eat crayons, or Titan main no brain.) and DPSers play the most simple role of ""thing in front of you needs to die, so hit buttons to make it die"". Their jobs are to eat crayons and make the boss mad, or to stab the boss in the kidneys respectively and since its the healers job to heal them, when ever they die it obviously has to be because the support is shitty and dont know their ass from their elbow, all while ignoring the fact they stood in the fire.

&#x200B;

> Generally when someone warns you about the Genji in the backline or the  player galleon pulling up to the skull fort, the best choice isn't to  say ""yeah, yeah"" and continue arguing over the best LoL character for  midlane. 

This part sounds like just shitty teammates (and the overwatch community being shit in general) as this happens to guys as well. Back when I played trash games like LoL, i lost counts of how many times I personaly have warned teammates about a gank coming, they ignore it and get ganked, then blame everyone else in any way possible. Jungler didnt keep enough pressure on, Mid didnt push hard enough, ADC isnt geared, no one put down wards where THEY wanted them, etc. Mean while its because he pushed to hard with 3/5 of the enemy team missing from view and no allies around.
