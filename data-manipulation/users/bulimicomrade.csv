fatlogic,fej2zmd,t1_fej1fks,1579154970.0,"There is an aspect of restriction to BED, but it's mental, not physical. You'll binge and then be like, ""I'm gonna eat less now to make up for it/won't let myself eat this anymore because I keep binging on it"" and then you feel deprived because you are telling yourself you can't have the food. That causes you to be like, ""fuck it, I'll eat a bunch of this now and then not binge anymore after that."" and then the cycle restarts. This isn't universal, but it can feel like you're restricting yourself if that's the mindset that you have between binges, and BED is a lot more stigmatized than AN, so I get why some people with BED would want to say they have AN."

Unless Lizzo is calling for everyone to gain weight and be obese too, or promoting the message that being fat isn't unhealthy, I don't get why people keep commenting on her body.

There is a side to BED that is restriction, but it's more mental than physical. You'll think, ""After this binge I am never going to eat _____ again"" or ""I'm not eating tomorrow because I binged today"" and that will fuel the next binge because you feel deprived despite having just eaten a large quantity of food.
