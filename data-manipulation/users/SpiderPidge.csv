AskMen,ff5fhgn,t3_erlbbu,1579590591.0,"Dude was ""helping someone move"" for a few hours while I waited in Books a Million. We had discussed a time a day prior. Oh and I had to pay for both of our food because he wasn't going to have money until a few days after. 

He also casually flashed a dildo he had.....never telling me he was anything but straight. (different time.....dunno why I gave him the time of day) He also wanted me to shave a certain way and x and y things. I told him bye. As someone who is...well....not straight.....being kept in the dark was shitty.

Point is, first dates say a lot. I don't have an issue with any of the individual things, but have the decency and respect for me to tell me the truth. It isn't hard."
PS4,ff3q40v,t3_erf4eo,1579546431.0,"Watchdogs Legion did this to me too! Assholes! As much as I want to play them, I appreciate the devs not sending out a game they know is incomplete."
PS4,ff3pclj,t3_erakws,1579545966.0,"GOW is the best game on the PS4 right now. I knew I was going to really like it going in, but it has become one of my favorite games of all time. 

Take any screenshot of the game and it looks like a painting. The story is wonderful, and the gameplay is a masterclass in how to design a non-linear action/adventure game. 

I can't say enough great things about the game. It is a masterpiece."
patientgamers,fex8qhh,t3_eqj99i,1579426942.0,"Yeah.......it's weird. Yeah I imagine I have a nostalgia filter when I see games I've played and enjoyed in the past. However, I just know some of the games will look like shit if I tried to replay it. 

Max Payne comes to mind recently; as much as I love it, it looks AWFUL now."

playstation,felszrv,t3_epkrfi,1579230185.0,"Please, please, please......full backward compatibility. They can launch with 1 or 2 titles and have a MASSIVE launch with full BC.

But I digress. I am almost positive the PS5 won't be fully bc. Do we really think Playstation wants to give us that, when they can still make a few pennies on PS Now? I might just be cynical, but it's a too-good-to-be-true situation and it almost never goes that way. There is always a caveat to a great system."

aww,fel4dmz,t1_fekypm3,1579213803.0,"I love you. As a cat owner (before having dogs), I adopted a feral kitty who was super shy at first because her mom was super protective of her. I would put food out for them every day until they moved under our house. Slowly but surely the baby got more curious and ended up rubbing against my leg every time I'd bring out food. 

She lives with her brother with my parents. c:"
facepalm,fel3yj0,t3_epktir,1579213547.0," Student loans are what made me stop taking out loans for school. If I can't pay with scholarships and out of pocket, I'm not going to go. I've been lucky to get my first degree with help from my state, so I only have 4.5k in student loans.

I really hate our ""education system"". It's more like: if you have money you can do or become whatever you want; but if you're poor.....you can't go to school."
gaming,fekwidt,t3_epn6hu,1579209053.0,"In Kingdom Hearts 3's case.......eh.....not really. It depends on why the game is delayed. If it is delayed for quality purposes, sure. But if it is delayed years and years because of the head studio wanting the game to be a certain way.....no.

(In my opinion Kingdom Hearts 3 started and stopped production based solely on the opinion of Disney. There was clearly a list of worlds Disney wanted, based on their recent hit's like Tangled, Big Hero 6, and Frozen, and it destroyed the quality of the game because of this)"

PS4,fdt9zxn,t1_fdt1jvp,1578713862.0,As much as I love Ratchet (and like Sly)......the Jak games are just so much better. I don't expect a new Jak or Sly game; and out of the 3 Ratchet will get a new game.

gaming,fdrhybz,t3_emqsnx,1578684725.0,Swampert's Surf and Waterfall destroyed the Elite 4 in Sapphire/Ruby/Emerald. Even with the Full Restore. Fucking hated them in Sun and Moon because that meant I had to play those god awful games more.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fdlo1k5,t3_elrpox,1578528406.0,I had a creep teacher who would look down every girl's shirt and would drop things for them to bend down for. Everyone knew and would make fun of him between classes.

gaming,fbsx37n,t3_eebane,1577062508.0,"Critics hate it because it isn't a western bastardization of the series. It is purely European, with European tropes and lore. With that, the show doesn't follow the same formula other fantasy shows have been; which is one of the many reasons I am loving the show. 

Also, casting is pretty spot on."
