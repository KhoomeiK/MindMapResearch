Of course it would if we did it all time for everyone. But we dont, not by a long shot. I'm not talking about returning everything all the time. Hell, I denied two returns today personally. I'm talking about customer retention situations, in which it is more important to break the rules to keep a recurrent shopper than to prevent the loss on that one sale.

Because people are complaining about the thing I'm discussing and discussions are two-sided? Because the cuts from modernization have already happened and these new ones are a direct result of yearly rollbacks and not some conspiracy to fuck you over? Because this will be over in a few weeks when hours go back (literally the schedule my store is writing right now for 3 weeks out has more hours than any week this month)?

Target,fee94i4,t1_fee6476,1579028951.0,"Except, well, it is normal. As I have said elsewhere, I have been in retail for 17 years. Every. Single. Company I have worked for in that time period has slashed payroll in January/February. Every store, every year.

Two part answer here:

1. They have been eliminating redundant TL, GSTL, and ETL positions this year. Less redundant management = less hands on the wheel = less micromanagement and clearer expectations and instructions. 

2. You cant run a business like a democracy. If people voted on the management you would wind up with a lot of ineffective but popular managers. If people voted on rules we'd lose most of them, and many are neccessary."

 Pretty much SOP company wide. Apprehensions are for repeat offenders or large amounts of merchandise, I'm not starting a fight over 20 bucks. I'd rather just have it back and them leave.

>Have you ever wondered why retail doesn't put effort in year round sales instead of weighting it toward the end?

Because that's when people spend the most money? People arent making large purchases right now. They just spent a ton of money on the holidays and just received a bunch of the things they needed. Frivolous and luxury spending are nobody's priority right now because they both need less things and have less money to spend. Target is not somehow choosing to have lower sales right now.

>Another part of their model in cutting hours at the beginning of the year is to sink vacation hours. Basically they want to control employee vacation periods. Social engineering is not what the bad guys do or is it?

That's a fine theory....but it doesnt make much sense considering they cap them pretty low. Granted that isn't much better, but still. If they could choose between letting you have more vacation hours or having higher sales, they would absolutely choose the higher sales considering the amount they actually let you bank.

>Also Target has shown considerable growth (6-7%) in the last few years and yet they don't trickle any of that down. 

Except for raising the minimum wage over the last year. It's about to go up again, and will untill it hits 15. So that's exactly what they are doing. Yes they cut hours, but base pay is going up by a higher % than payroll is going down.

Look, I'm not going to tell you target is perfect. They have made some bad decisions, some REALLY bad( Target Canada... oh boy.) But I've been in retail for 17 years. If you really think any of the other large retailers arent doing the same **and worse**  then I invite you to go there. I guarantee you won't like what you find.
