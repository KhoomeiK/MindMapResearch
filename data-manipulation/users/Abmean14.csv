Adoption,ffkhi08,t1_fdfgz6k,1580022841.0,"I was born in Calcutta, India; and I live in a small town in northern Indiana. I never had any major problems, other than being a typically rebellious difficult teenager. Honestly, so many little quirks in my son, come from my Dad. Which is really neat."
wholesomememes,ffiwwrc,t1_ffhhzo1,1579984697.0,"I guess, but I got to the point where I couldn’t carry on a civil conversation with someone outside of a work environment; so I had Ricardo start teaching me “nice words”."
wholesomememes,ffiwll8,t1_ffhd2ch,1579984473.0,"Honestly, biggest drive for me to become fluent in Spanish was when I was learning some of the bigger fabrication jobs in my shop. I would have a coworker who was highly skilled and could teach me; but there was a language barrier. 

So I personally took it upon myself to start learning names of tools, parts and measurements in Spanish. That way when someone was 10 feet in the air and needs anything, they could yell, and I’d immediately know what they needed and grab said tool/part for them. 

This helps the flow of the shop go so much smoother, and raises moral. If I’m making an effort to learn a new language, you feel more confident in trying to learn mine."

I have always been a tiny bit curious to read my paperwork, since I’m the oldest; but I choose not to. 

I know my parents struggled with infertility; just like my wife and I did. I know they had to deal with a lot of different issues by pursuing an international adoption, rather than a domestic one. 

Our family isn’t perfect; but it’s our family. I would never want to read something that would change the unconditional love I have for my parents; especially my mother. 

She retired early to help take care of our children when my wife and I work long shifts, and she sees so much of me in my kids; especially my son. Something she chose to do on her own."

Like u/Aceadventura said; my hamster wheel won’t stop turning. I can’t stop beating myself while second guessing every decision I’ve made during the day.

Unfortunately, my solution to turn my mind off requires a vice. I drink heavily to get to sleep; which creates its own set of problems. I wish I could offer better advice, but this “works” for me ATM."

Two years later I started dating my (now) wife. Our marriage is far from perfect, but I don’t feel lost and alone anymore. 

Once our children were born, I finally started to feel my sense of belonging. The best example of this is when I come home from work. I’m tired and sore, but then my 2 yr old son runs to me to show me what he’s done today, and to be snuggled.

My parents taught me and my siblings (also adopted) about Indian culture, but basically raised us as if we weren’t any different than our friends. (Basically raised white, but in in a very positive way.)

I struggled with the fact that I couldn’t live up to the stereotypes of being a doctor, or someone with multiple degrees. I’m very intelligent, but because of ADHD, school was always a struggle for me. 

I identified more with the working class, and now I’m a well paid welder who can use his mind to help troubleshoot situations faster than others.
My close friends will always joke with me that I’m the darkest redneck they know.
