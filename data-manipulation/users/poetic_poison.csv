Her bio is just embarrassing and Bryson’s friends are going to be right on that in a few years. Even by the standards of the industry that’s yikes. That being said she deserves to work safely like anyone else... but yeah, this is not everyone’s cup of tea and surely that’s not a surprise. I’m ready for the downvotes for not suggesting that literally anything sex related is by default godly and safe from criticism."
