The thing about the placebo effect is its all psychological. There's more we don't understand about the brain than what we do. The subconscious part of the brain seems to have much more control over things like physiological stress, which produces or excaserbates physical symptoms.

Saying the story in this movie was well thought out is like saying LaCroix has too much flavor. There's no consistency from one scene to the next, and the whole thing is held together by only the most tenuous of threads.

So the premise of the story is that somehow a magically self sustaining train (that is actually simply a regular train with a nuclear reactor) houses the only remaining humans, and it must, for some reason, keep moving along its trains-continental track that also just happens to be well maintained always and forever.

Why can't the train just sit in one spot where it's safe?

Why not refit the train to house more people? They have the power, and if they connected it to a building they could avoid the entire plot.

Why do they not explain what the third class people are eating?

Why does the engineer kidnap children to replace simple mechanical parts instead of doing literally anything else?

Is that tweaker woman and the kid the only ones to survive?

I don't understand why everyone on this sub seems to think that the average layperson:

A) Has a broad enough understanding of the topic to not be completely confused by these low-level technical details

B) Cares, *at all*, about such detail

C) Wants anything more than a coarse overview of any topic, unless specifically requested.

The detail you brought up, while technically accurate, is *entirely irrelevant*. No one asked, and literally the only thing being achieved by injecting unnecessary detail into an otherwise *fine* simplified overview is to confuse the topic, and to draw attention to yourself for knowing more than the other guy.

What you brought up is, honestly, *not* worth talking about in this context. It's a simplified explanation of the gross differences between analog and digital storage on magnetic media. The details of magnetic media compensation are pretty fascinating, but the people interested in that is a very small niche, and there's a huge amount of foundational knowledge you need before any of it makes any kind of sense.

explainlikeimfive,feh5d5i,t1_feh2yub,1579109479.0,"Generally we define digital as having finite, discrete states. Usually this is just a 1 or a 0.

In the case of a hard drive, the data is stored digitally, any individual bit on the actual magnetic platter can have a positive or negative charge. One or zero.

On a tape, data is stored analog, it can have any range of values. Physically, this is written on the tape as ""flux density"", which is just a fancy way of saying how strong the magnetic field on the tape is. To write ""1"", you'd write with a very strong magnetic field, and a ""0"" would have almost no field. You can write any value in between by varying the strength of the magnetic field you write with.

When you read back an analog tape, the read head converts the magnetic field on the tape into an electrical signal. You essentially get the exact same signal out as you originally put in. This makes it pretty easy for analog circuits to process and display the data; there's no real conversion involved, mostly just amplify the signal and pass it to the speaker or screen."

I am a programmer. As in, I do this shit for a living. I don't have a ton of experience on computer vision, but I did a bunch of research for a potential project years ago.

Here's the thing about computer vision libraries: they have done 99% of the work. You train the machine on the objects you want recognized, and tweak some settings. And counter to your point, this does not require highly technical skill, or a massive investment. That's literally the *entire point* of libraries existing.

The breakdown is pretty simple. The CV lib processes raw data from a camera. You tell it what you want it to track, and it feeds you back whatever data you request. You, the programmer, put that data into your game engine; massage the data, correlate, allocate points to the player.

The CV library represents the *vast* majority of the complexity in this system. Handling the data provided by the CV system is *trivial*. It's honestly just comparing positions frame to frame and computing velocity.

Software libraries are a thing because absolutely nobody wants to hire a full in house R&D team to build computer vision for a video game, or a fancy cluster database framework, or whatever whizbang new bleeding edge tech is happening. Someone else has fronted the engineering cost. The library is built, tested, and proven by someone else. A library can represent *thousands* of hours of work *that you don't have to do*. We use libraries because someone else with more skill and narrower focus has made a thing much better than we could in the time allotted.

> Why design complicated computer vision systems that require cameras and sophisticated algorithms when a simple off the shelf accelerometer would solve the same problem?

The answer to your question is very simple. Nobody would design a new CV system for a game like this.

However, no one would use expensive and delicate tracking electronics when there are ready-made CV solutions that can be had for free or close to it."
