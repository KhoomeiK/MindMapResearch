CAguns,ffjmu8v,t1_ffjls8c,1580001899.0,You need to look in the mirror when you're saying that. What was said that you consider vitriol? I honestly have friends from all over the political spectrum and I'd wager that almost all have no idea of where I fall politically. And I'm not a Republican or Democrat.  What  I have noticed is that the anti crowd generally fall in the more government control of everything but firearms are number one. I won't vote for any of that and its certainly broader than just firearms.

That we'd love the liberal politicians that have fucked the California gun owners for the past 20 years? Any politician expressing anti 2nd views either is pandering to his base or one of those illogical sorts that believe inanimate objects are the problem.  Fuck them either way because they don't have the judgement to represent me or are a weasel. I'm not voting for David Duke either but I do pay attention  to the 2nd stance and most of those folks double down being assholes."
CAguns,ffjiqls,t1_ffj5cep,1579999129.0,You call that vitriol?  Maybe you are sensitive little  snowflakes. That was mild. If you vote for people who are antis then you're  part of the problem.

We have a luxury system.  The number of people involved, the technology, and sheer quantity that are cleaning,  taking  out trash, etc. was kind of mind boggling.  The sheer cost was readily obvious and we have to get past some of that to make universal healthcare work. And the level of bitching and moaning we'll do if we don't get it will a cacophony.

Haven't seen anything on a DJI equivalent. The P4RTK has/had software issues on the flight planning to work around. We had a good workflow within a couple weeks but there were definitely wrong turns you could make depending on your processing software and their settings. There's a different set of assumptions."

photogrammetry,fezlyaq,t3_eqyb81,1579458821.0,Lens quality is huge in any sort of photography. The sensor can be great but a mediocre lens leads to mediocre pictures. Look at prime lenses with the caveat that the fixed nature means you move the camera for framing not the zoom. The fixed 50mm 1.8 is cheap and is capable of some very good pictures. Much better than the 18-55mm kit lenses. Also be wary of cheap filters. I've never regretted buying good lenses but have often regretted the early cheap ones when looking at pictures I've taken.

Frankly I have a very good life in a great town backed up to a vineyard with a view of the hills. We're already a little cowboy out here since you see the local ranchers with flatbeds of hay and lots of pickups. There's a range in town that's well kept and a great town culture. Also have ranch in Mendocino county where we shoot regularly and hunt with a view of the Pacific. 

Despite all that, the state government is making it untenable in the long run. From their vindictive, spiteful, arbitrary policies on guns to their never ending quest to have all the money they can piss away I really question where we'll live in 5 years. I want to stay until my kids graduate high school and we've already started scoping out other areas of the country for an early retirement. It will be a crying shame but this state is going the wrong direction and digging faster. It's leadership is morally and fiscally bankrupt. The single biggest improvement would be a sinkhole in Sacramento when the legislature is in session. My only hope on the firearms aspect is with judges like Benitez and the supreme court."

I'm fortunate my health is otherwise good and I got in pretty fast. 

I'm going to try and travel more with my wife and kids, work on getting the shoulder and back issues that I believe cause the sleep problems, and not push quite as hard at work. I'm already going to bed an hour earlier, losing weight with a careful but reasonable diet, and walking quite a bit.

Getting in very fast was the key and I didn't actually manifest stroke symptoms until I was halfway there in the ambulance.

I was very fortunate and felt a little bit like an oddity in the ICU and stroke unit because of the recovery. Have had some residual occurrence of symptoms that were the worst the 3rd day and milder each day. Didn't notice them at all yesterday. Doctor followup yesterday and had lots of questions. The doctor said he was very surprised because BP is well under control, not overweight by very much at all (BMI 24). Cholesterol is in the 180s. Ran tons of tests and still looking for the reason. One suspicion is sleep because I've had a nagging shoulder/neck problem for several years now and only get about 6 hours a night at best. Sleep study, heart monitor, and neuro followup all scheduled and on aspirin, plavix and lipitor. Just feeling my way through it and glad to be alive and relatively unscathed.

AskReddit,fe635t3,t1_fe4ucdo,1578880735.0,I live a Bart trip away. Can't stand most of it except for the Presidio. Some good clubs and restaurants but outside of those is such a hole these days. And the city is mostly interested in how much they can extract from your wallet.
AskReddit,fe62jlb,t1_fe3arsl,1578880346.0,Yes. Its just so cheap and tawdry. I'm no prude but even the local news sounds like a shittier version of entertainment tonight. Unfortunately I end up there at least one week per year.
AskReddit,fe61r1n,t1_fe3vh0t,1578879836.0,One of the best fishing trips I ever had was out on that prairie.  Only reason you knew there was a stream was trees and it was 4 ft across in some places. Pulled some of the hardest hitting trout out there I've ever seen.
bayarea,fe5yrp2,t1_fe5wzr6,1578877943.0,We did weekdays in the early spring a couple  of years ago and despite the snow going in it was nice and not crowded. Have to deal with some weather sometimes but its beautiful.  Wouldn't catch me anywhere close during  summer. Reminds me of a theme park.
ClayBusters,fe5ou52,t3_envl7n,1578872386.0,Better than usual wood on that one. My boys love theirs and it reminds me a lot of my 391.

woodworking,fe5fb6m,t3_enq7we,1578868802.0,One of the things I love about cherry. I cheat however and sit it outside for half a day in the sun to get more up front.
airguns,fe5dawr,t3_enu3hl,1578867995.0,"It's likely in the rings or mounts. On trick to check before even putting the scope in is use a 3 foot dowel/rod (I use a 1"" closet rod) to check the alignment of the rings prior to the scope. You'll see the angular difference as it projects past the muzzle and can try to adjust then."

bayarea,fe51qc1,t1_fe4xj2h,1578864895.0,Yosemite has been an issue for the 40+ years I've been going. It's an international destination and I've heard more different languages spoken there than probably any other. The tourist traffic there in summer is so high that I never even consider going in that time period.
AskMen,fe4hwe6,t1_fe4frru,1578859509.0,"No, that's my two son's deal and it's a little early since they're both in high school. The older has had several relationships and I mostly just try to stay out of the way, take the pictures as asked (prom, etc.), and act as a sounding board for questions. It will get more serious later.  

We're not one of those families that dislike the inlaws. My wife and mom are very close and that's a family thing. I remember my Mom would take my grandfather lunch on occasion just for a visit because they both enjoyed kippers and Scotch and nobody else did.  And my mom and grandmother were also close."

OldSchoolCool,fe3ltpj,t1_fe3e6qb,1578850485.0,It looks like they had the drill down (practiced). That's what it means in the language of the day and context
tifu,fe3dgwy,t3_enook9,1578848318.0,My wife likes to tease me about how in shape she was in her teen years. Of course I was really close to the same age. Nothing pervy about that. I'm not interested in teenage girls but can certainly appreciate how pretty they can be.
