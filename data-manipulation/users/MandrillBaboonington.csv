This has gone off on a weird tangent. Back to the original post: that’s an absolute eyesore and I do not support trump 
However the fact that this “import” brand was very likely manufactured in the US by unionized workers while GM pushes most (emphasis on most) of their production overseas is such a huge dosage of hypocrisy delivered by the “patriotic consumers” it forces us to question either their loyalty, or their knowledge.."

Though we should take into account that the rolls offered and accepted by these people are theirs to choose. Therefore the standpoint of the artist should be acknowledged, regardless of our personal opinions of what they believe the characters they’re portraying should stand for..
Thin ice these days, I realize that..
It’s just something to keep in mind next time you see your boomer relatives post a poorly executed meme starring a popular movie character voicing an absolutely absurd opinion... it’s a truly free market (entertainment) and it’s everyone’s entitlement. All that ambiguity out of the way, my personal perspective of the matter is: acting is an art form and as such it is up to the artist if they’re willing to use the medium as a platform for self glorification or as a means of protest, or simply a paycheck. Either way, I get what you mean

Your target demographic is more likely gonna see this as a parasitical byproduct more than an eye opener..
Your original plan of opening their consciousness by way of the indoctrination they’ve surely, and in this case conveniently already received might be more effective
Ie: using the bible verses to show just how wrong the Trumpers are.. maybe this same image along side a bible reference putting down idolizing/false gods.. might even go as far as antichrist territory.."
