longisland,ffi1q9g,t1_ffhkhy1,1579962475.0,"Hey.... These are the things that I thought up spontaneously as a person that does not work for the school district. Again, I'd have to review the whole system. You can't tell me that bringing in large organizational consulting groups wouldn't result in some great directions for school districts. There's always areas for improvement. Good results are the enemybof great work. School district costs for Nassau county are amongst the highest in America and satisfaction is not equally high. 

Also, you answered each of my points, but you're only reviewing them at a surface level. Participating in a state run pension still requires two contributors, the school and the pensioner. School districts could negotiate for a change there. My school district had a warehouse, admin buildings, and a garage to store records, books, automobiles, and people. My school district had votes on budgets but never had any votes for programs and offerings. 

Even though I'm reading your response believing that everything that you've written, the conclusion cannot be equally accepted, there are ways to not increase the budget or even *gasp* lower the budget."

longisland,ffdbj24,t1_ffd5x60,1579817337.0,"Did you read the heavily caveated response to your original post? I'm not a school administrative official... I am a government employee in the area of HR, admin, shipping, logistics, facilities, finance, travel, et al. I don't know how a public school organization is run. 

I'd have to ask about things like retirement packages. How much do employees contribute versus the district? Who runs it? When can they receive it? When do they vest? What is the value of that retirement package rather than a 401k?What other deferred methods of compensation are more appealing to both employers and employees? What are the biggest capital costs? Is it warehouse? What are heavily used buildings and how often are they used? Is there a way to utilize these facilities to the benefit of other government programs and share that capital cost? 

Any time any product is compulsory, recipients are less likely to know about the details of a product. Are the benefits of the product expertly advertised? Are there offerings that customers would want as opposed to what's on the table now? Are some highly expensive extra curriculars offered whereas other cheaper offerings would be more appreciated? Maybe the community values science over language or vice versa. If you're happier with the compulsory product, recipients are less likely to gripe. 

Again, I'm not a school official. These are the ways that I've gone about making a budget skinnier. We utilize moving services and it's easy to fall in a rut of using the same vendors. How often are vendors vetted and changed? There's so much work to be done and so many ways to bring it all together."

However, I am a government employee with a focus on finance, procurement, logistics, admin, and HR. I don't know HOW to cut school budgets because I don't work at schools.

I'm not some random angry guy only posting on women's photos. I often view photos here and on photo critique and comment from time  to time. I'll add that I never said any other particular industries. I'm asking you if you've done some exploring of how you're composing the shot.

Second question... Do you like the angle? It feels like the camera is aiming down at you... on a bed. That plus the ring lights pushes my mind to some other stuff I've seen.

longisland,ffb50eb,t1_ffb2lsw,1579751957.0,"I *feel* like you're correct. Removing one or even ten top administrators at 300k will do little. The fact is that Nassau and Suffolk service more than a million residents' kids to a fairly high level. There are probably ways to cut the budget, but I don't think removing the most competent administrative people will make the educational system any more effective."

todayilearned,ff2advs,t1_fezg1ly,1579498601.0,"In reading your response, I don't think you understand what the federal system represents: an effective, efficient, and fair system of tying together different states. While you're correct, States **could** create a new system of laws designed to interact with each other. Yet, it's rather foolish to envision a Euro, African, or Asian system of dozens of smaller states which will have to spend time and energy creating massive and ultimately weak bureaucracy in order to deal with each other and keep their economic edge. The US would quickly go from premier political/economic entity to bureaucracy laden bundle of sovereigns. I *do realize* that the world has winner and loser nations. You don't seem to realize that the current nation of 350 million winners would quickly devolve to far less winners for your bargain, a system of 50 state governments replacing the federal government with far less efficiency. The idea that you're willing to let a state fall to the failed state level of Yemen is interesting. I'm not sure I'm willing to do that.

Also, I've read the constitution. Reading the document is a wonderful and fruitful exercise. Yet, I don't think you've read any of the precedence, federal law, or history of the federal system to contextually understand how it all works. Reading a singular document without the ancillary precedence misses the whole point of the precedent system. The simple definition posted above regarding sovereignty lacks any real thoughtful analysis about sovereigns, federal systems, and the present system of governmental authority. You should try reading that book I've listed above to learn about a small part of the federal legal system.

The rest of your points are poorly postulated: Yes, German and French people cross pollinate for work and leisure, but their system of isn't any less complex than the current federal system. Airplanes exist, but 90% of the world's cargo moves by ship. That figure alone would mean that 90% of your new system would be dominated by the three or four port states. I can't tell if you lack information here or don't care about how this would affect the remaining states. 50 new diplomatic services seeking supremacy for 50 new states could be disastrous. This doesn't touch on the international de

My argument here is: 1. the US federal system currently enables 50 states to become an entity far greater than the sum of its parts. 2. The current federal system is far more effective/efficient than a system of 50 sovereign nations individually drafting legislation for legal interaction between each other."

You haven't thought out things like.... Being employed in one state and working across state boarders, int'l purchasing in states without SPODs or APODs, inequity of employment/personal rights across state borders(port states could control almost entirely what quality/type/etc products everywhere else get), and disagreements between states. 

Then

That's interesting but somewhat laughable. You're asking to create a system of border police for every state? 

Then

>For example, we as a nation have extradition treaties with some nations, but not for all. It depends on our relationships

Who manages those deals? Each state creates its own diplomatic service? Do America's closest allies have 50 new embassies from the 50 states? When the big four economies, CA, NY, TX, and FL decide that it's in their best interest to fuck over the rest of the states in some diplomatic economic move, what do you do? You're not asking for a system of states, you're asking for a complete destruction of the concept of a singular nation and a the creation of a 50 individual nations. I mean, that's cool, but I'd bet you wouldn't like how that would roll out in a practical sense. Rather the world's largest economy, the new individual states would spring forth a creation of serious winners and losers, and it would only get far worse as inequity between the states leverages higher and higher."
