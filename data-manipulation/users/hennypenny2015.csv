BabyBumps,ffaikob,t3_esgav5,1579736587.0,"We're also horrible at names AND don't know the gender. We have a list of 10 boy and 10 girl names, but we're going to wait until we see the face. We're not even dead set on picking something from our lists. All we know is that it must be old-fashioned to match our other kid's names. My due date is in 1 wk. Good luck!"
