AmItheAsshole,ffuohgn,t3_ev8ur2,1580246245.0,NTA if people don't snap back every so often these self righteous A-holes will never learn that they can ID everyone just based on initial appearances.
shittyfoodporn,ffp10yp,t1_ffnfalq,1580084121.0,The main flavor in Mt Dew is orange so it's actually not surprising that it turned out alright.
CasualConversation,ffizkps,t1_ffi4fp9,1579986626.0,"Exactly, for me it is like going into a crowded room and starting up a conversation with a stranger, but without all of the social anxiety I usually feel."
starterpacks,ffizhin,t1_ffiemu8,1579986562.0,Nice I'll have to check it out
starterpacks,ffi3kmf,t1_ffhpu1b,1579964073.0,"It is great, but somewhat limited outside the scope of basic subjects. I look forward to their expansion into more subjects."
CasualConversation,ffi3b9a,t3_etnl2h,1579963853.0,"I miss chatrooms and things like ICQ where you could talk in real time with people you didn't know. It was still a rush that things would get overly sexual, but there were also good conversations to be had. I miss the discovery of new people from around the world without having to sign up for a dating service, I feel like there are very few others for that kind of conversation anymore, it's all become so focused on niche interests or sexual/romantic relationship."
AmItheAsshole,ffcbo0t,t3_esrtrc,1579795966.0,"NTA some people would rather never be fired for whatever reason. He chose to quit and you have him a couple of chances to take it back, his lack of severance pay is his choice."
CasualConversation,ffabjrl,t3_eshphc,1579731685.0,"I most certainly posted on my social media when I was finally debt free, it was meet with a largely positive response.

Congratulations by the way, feels great doesn't it?"

Incorgnito,fetps5d,t3_eqgmyp,1579378125.0,Looks like a Pomeranian or maybe a bit of papillon in there.
whitepeoplegifs,feticr7,t1_ferooh5,1579375735.0,"This should be a top comment, originality is nearly impossible without looking like a fashion weirdo. If it looks good on most people, most people will wear it."
AmItheAsshole,fesr4e9,t3_eqf0v4,1579368128.0,"NTA you were excluded when you were clearly in the family, not being married is a strange way in modern times to decide someone isn't a pay off the family. Sure you are salty about being left out for years and someone asked why you weren't included, maybe you were a bit TA for bringing up their failed marriages, but I can understand why you did it.

My family included SOs in pictures even if they were just boyfriends or girlfriends, if they were closer enough to be at a family gathering they were close enough to be in the pictures. If they are concerned about bad feelings later they could take ""blood only"" family pictures and separate extended family pictures, with digital photos there is no reason not to do a variety of pictures."
IBEW,fec45pq,t1_fe5s68l,1578966387.0,"Tbh I haven't taken the time to dig into the details, but I've been told it's a very comprehensive package with a mixture of funds."
YouShouldKnow,fec3w9p,t1_febsd6e,1578966279.0,"There are kits for wills and other legal documents, but the safest route is to hire a lawyer or at least a legal professional to guide you through the process. This ensures that everything is properly noted and signed off on and the documents are legal.

If you try to do it on your own it might help your wishes be known, but it likely won't hold up in court."
IBEW,fe1sixt,t3_enkk8q,1578830352.0,"I joined last year at age 38, in my local I won't qualify for full retirement benefits until age 65, if I was younger there would be a possibility of earlier retirement. As it is my retirement package will be slightly lower since I will not have been contributing as long as someone younger, but I still get a pension.

As someone else said, this varies by your local and what they have worked out for a retirement package. The best thing to do would be to call the hall and ask them."
JusticeServed,fdqbthz,t1_fdpsywv,1578662370.0,"As far as timing goes for the woman, giving a baby up for adoption is giving up legal responsibility for the child. I fully agree that both parties should be able to give up and claim full legal responsibility for a baby."

electrical,fd8xq2q,t3_ek7kw5,1578225033.0,"I think it's a mix, I'm subscribed to this and the IBEW subreddit, even there it is largely a bunch of getting into the apprenticeship questions. It's all about who the most active posters are.

To be fair I don't see anything in the about section for this subreddit which means I could come here and post about potatoes if I wanted and not be breaking any rules."
YouShouldKnow,fd67gcs,t1_fd50vx1,1578186638.0,So what did they get from you over the phone?
ExpectationVsReality,fd387hq,t1_fd1ys6n,1578155693.0,"I switched to an online retailer (ShaveMob, although there are a few to choose from), the razors are just black and white, but they are cheaper and they have a variety of blade and handle options."
YouShouldKnow,fd371nt,t1_fczpcmd,1578155296.0,"Exactly, they should be giving you 100% of the information and just asking if you agree with the purchases, never asking you to give information. This is true for basically any business you deal with."
AskReddit,fcvtzyd,t1_fcvlqfk,1578010069.0,"Seemed unlikely, but awesome to meet someone else with a similar PoF experience!"

oldrecipes,fcvif0n,t3_ebrahi,1578002751.0,"A YouTuber did a video where she made this, it was an interesting watch.

AmItheAsshole,fco05ma,t3_ei40zr,1577821702.0,"I assume she got upset with you because you low-key insulted her by saying:

>""If it's a red flag to them, then good. Because it tells me which kind of girls I don't want to go for, if that's what they think"". 

She obviously thinks it's a red flag so you're response means you think less of her.

NTA, not having social media isn't a red flag, but it's unusual."

greentext,fci773v,t1_fchi6vk,1577658549.0,I think most kids stink and most dogs smell alright.
