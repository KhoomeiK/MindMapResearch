flatearth,ffuy6qv,t1_ffuv5rt,1580251597.0,"In the span of half an orbit - regardless of low long an orbit is - the sun will always be on the opposite side of Earth and the difference will always be *exactly* half a day - regardless of how long a day is.

The planet isn't designed to support life, life has evolved to conform to the planet. If years or days were different lengths, life would have adapted to those lengths and the lengths would be just as ""precise""."
flatearth,ffuuj7x,t1_ffuqz5o,1580249600.0,"That will happen regardless of the speed of any motion.

Being surprised at that time difference would be like being surprised it took 4 hours to travel from Point A to Point B, 100 miles away, at 25 miles per hour.  It's not a coincidence, it's just the difference in time between the sidereal day and the solar day.

If Earth spun twice as fast, the exact same thing would happen in January and July as happens now, it would just be a 1.5 minute difference between sidereal and solar days instead of 3."
flatearth,ffupzvu,t1_ffui375,1580247100.0,"I think you're conceiving your question in a way that makes it hard for you to understand the answer, but I'm not sure how to rephrase your question.

Basically day and night *are* ""reversed"" in the seasons, but we don't notice that because we always call it day when the Sun is visible and night when it's not. What we see as different are the constellations in the sky at night, one half on summer, the other in winter.

The movements aren't exact or even particularly related.  If Earth rotated faster or slower, or circled the Sun faster or slower the same thing would happen; we would have both a sidereal and solar day, and different constellations would be visible during different seasons."

news,ffrgc09,t1_ffqvqq7,1580157509.0,"Depending on what set of laws govern the problem, the most recent entity may be able to push responsibility back.

Either way it's not the citizens' or the government's problem - it's the entities' problem.  They are the most directly, and most recently, responsible for the damages. If one feel like the other should pay then the law should have those two people work it out after shit gets cleaned up - not have citizens who had no involvement suffer while megacorps dick them over with protracted legal delays."
