With vision, the eyes are not ""wrong,"" that's just how they grew. Bad vision isn't caused by something breaking, but by DNA telling the lens to grow a certain way which ends up poor for us who prefer our sight, you know, focused. Just like a short person isn't ""broken"" (presuming no stunted growth or damage) they just grew short. Magic wouldn't really fix that - you'd just regrow the same way. If whatever Murphy has is a hereditary condition, it would just regrow that way. 

Then there's magic damage. That's things like moody's leg (dark magic) and powerful magical creatures' damage (kettleburn). It varies what can be fixed. Dark magic clearly needs a powerful dark wizard to fix (Snape slowed the curse on Dumbles, when dumblydore couldn't do so himself - implying a specialty in dark magic is required, not just power). That's very time sensitive though - Snape says he could have done more if Dumbly came right away - if Murphy was hit by dark magic, there's a limited window where damage could be repaired, assuming whoever patched him up was practiced in dark magic to do so - something that seems ridiculously taboo. Then there's magical creature damage. We don't know too much about it from canon. A hippogriff scratch didn't seem too bad, but it was rather superficial. Werewolves obviously do permanent damage, and their scars are time- sensitive where treatment must be applied to reduce scarring. Kettleburn seems to be the only character permanently disfigured beyond scarring by creatures that we hear of, so it's not very clear if a creature could cause permanent leg or spinal damage. 

I still think Murphy is lame. They didn't create a creative or unique personality, or design. His personality is cardboard, his design is basic and his chair is basic, muggle and boring. They should have at least *attempted* to be creative with him. Instead he feels like a low-effort token."

There aren't wild cats or other large, climbing predators in Australia. So fires catch anything that can't run fast enough. Things like dingoes, which are maneuverable, oppurtunistic and instinctively run to chase or escape, do pretty well. They run from the fire, can establish themselves in most environments and adapt to new challenges. Things that burrow, try to burrow away from the fires. Things that fly, fly. And koalas, who climb, try to climb. This fire is moving so fast that anything that can't run over long distances gets caught. That leaves things like roos and wallabies, who are fast but not maneuverable (they can't reverse well, and aren't flexible enough to deal with many obstacles) to get stuck on things like fences or natural ridges, and die. Humans run into the same issues, like in the CA fire where people died trying to get away (and survived hiding in lakes, treading water for hours until the fire passed). It's not easy.

Boys lag behind physically and don't get hormone jumps until a few years after) Despite being identical, parents expect far more of their male children physically, and girls mentally. It's been shown that parents hamper their daughters from early turning over, crawling and walking by expecting less and stopping them. Here's a great study on it: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12262612_Gender_Bias_in_Mothers'_Expectations_about_Infant_Crawling 
By consistently overestimating their boys physically and underestimating their girls, they pressure their children to conform to gender norms. Boys benefit from this one, as they are encouraged to pursue physical activities, leading to stronger motor skills by childhood. In intelligence and social skills, girls have higher expectations and likely develop more in that area. We see this in regular school - girls have been trained since birth to be quiet, obedient and sit still in class. Boys have been encouraged to be physical and act out. This leads to boys behaving worse and doing worse in school, especially if there isn't a physical recess. Yet all studies show that *both* groups do far better after a physical recess, boys still lagging behind even with recess (but doing far better than without, more improvement)."

The game generally has the ""expected"" stats that repeat all the time at that point in the story, and then some outliers that are easier and harder. For the chimera, for example, it was exactly the expected stat checks. The dragon was slightly high. GB, in the correct SQ release time, technically a bit low. At this point in the game, you're pretty expected to be at all 24 or 25s, as most stat checks have been 24s and 25s, with extreme options (like threaten aberforth) at 27 and a few 22s. Cedric is 24x23x24. That's about on par to only very slightly easier than the expected. If the chimera is at expected- level stats, why is Cedric only slightly easier? Cedric doesn't need to be actual first year levels (like merula was at all 6s I think) but he should be ludicrously easy, like all 20s or even lower. He should be stupidly easy, not just a tiny bit less than expected.

I did a lot of modeling as a youngin - you needed to be at or above 50% leg. At 34/66 (~51%) I would be normal for a model, a bit leggy for a normal woman. Women run from about 45-50% leg on average. Men are more torso and are usually 40-45% leg (a 5'6"" man is generally recommended 30x28 pants). Assuming the pants fit correctly (and isn't vanity sized, which American pants absolutely are for men's fast fashion) 36 inseam/72 tall is 50% leg, which is very, very leggy for a man. 34/70 tall (~48%) is indeed above average for a man but probably not absurd."

My neighbor went to school at our community college in the 70s, and paid (according to her) 130/year, or almost exactly one week of her (uneducated) husband's pay then. Today at the same community college, it's ~1750 for me, (as again, just tuition). Problem is that the school doesn't publish those numbers. I just know someone who had a convenient measuring stick. Sure, both numbers are lower. However, one month's pay at average no-degree wage here is about $15/hr. That's, what, $500 each week? Not nearly as doable as back then.

Botchedsurgeries,fcn7s87,t1_fc4naaj,1577805488.0,"Your lips have different skin thickness. The skin is slightly thicker on the external parts of the lip, and thinner in the inside of the mouth. In normal people, the closed lips has the thicker skinned sections touching, with thinner skin fully within the mouth. The best way to see this division is in people with dark pigmentated lips. I'm assuming you've seen a black person in your life? They've got the highest likelihood of noticeably non-red pigmented lips, which is useful for this explanation. The parts of the lips that are typically brown, mauve or otherwise skin - colored is the external lip. That gives way to a bright reddish or pinkish color of the actual lip interior, only the slightest bit being visible with a closed mouth. Understand the division I'm outlining? In this situation, roughly 2/3 of the lip is either interior to the mouth (constantly wet) or is moistened by breath and normal lip motion. With heavy, heavy filler, more lip isn't created. Instead, the interior sections of the lip are pushed out to become exterior, but they have far thinner skin than is needed to be exterior. Only a small section of flesh on the inside is staying properly moistened, due to moist of it being pushed out by filler into that permanent duck face extension. Thin skin dries out easier without the thicker dermis to protect it. It splits easier since it's so thin. You get the point."

That defies the logical Ravenclaw, and the shrewd Slytherin. They're an absolute asshole to their friends both in story and in game mechanics (like gobstones, Chiara) to teachers/adults, and to anyone the story demands, and often go way too far. That pretty much rules out Hufflepuff. They're overly favored by Gryffindor staff, especially Dumbles. They can pretty much only be Gryffindor, and not a particularly good example of one, either. Their recklessness and endangering others (for very little benefit, like peeves/Y5) can be called ""nerve"" and ""daring"" even if I see it as absolute pointless idiocy. Their refusal to think about better options, like bringing larger groups or older students and adults, or even informing adults where they'll be and what they've discovered, rules out wisdom, resourcefulness and teamwork. 

So yeah. Gryffindor. The house points situation is a game mechanic, not a story one, since you can win or lose without affecting completion.

fatlogic,fcgp1nm,t1_fcb7w82,1577642526.0,"I think that's a bit disingenuous considering pizza it's a bit more ""uniform"" an idea. The average pizza fails due to far too much salt, saturated fat, and calories, regardless of where you buy it or what toppings. The most popular pizza (going off American statistics, it's all I've read on this subject) is generally shown to be pepperoni, which isn't helping matters at all, as pepperoni shares the same issues. 

The average *side* salad is fairly uniform, and has romaine lettuce, tomatos, carrot slices, and a few stray leaves of other plants (iceberg lettuce for crunch, cucumber slices, purple cabbage, and/or spinach are common) which is more nutrient dense per 100g and isn't bad at all. Even if you use the worst dressing, it's not as salty or fatty as pizza, though dressings like ranch do jump those numbers up. The average *meal* salad is a gamble - piles of cheese, croutons or chips, meats (bacon, fried chicken, etc), and hardly any plants left over is certainly one kind of salad - especially at a pizza joint or fast food place. Or a meal salad at a cheap restaurant like Dennys could be not bad at all with loads of healthy vegetables, and few unhealthy bits - only the dressing brings it down and not as much as pizza's salt, saturated fat and calorie counts. Home made salads are equally ambiguous. 

The average pizza isn't more nutritious than the average side salad, let alone an intentionally healthy salad. But salad isn't a uniform thing any more than ""soup"" is.

fatlogic,fcglxn2,t1_fccr5mk,1577641550.0,"They should rank the individual major nutrients instead of overall. Cereal is insanely healthy... for the nutrients the fortified it with. Iron especially - its really, really hard to get iron without a ton of meat and seafood. But most cereal grains are fortified with it. That's what's cheating for the cereal. It should be a bit more transparent why something is high and low, like 

Cocopuffs - C 

Per 100g;

Calories  - C

Vitamins - A

Sugar - D


Smoked Salmon - D

Per 100g

Calories - B

Vitamins - B

Sodium - F (50g has 1/3 of your days salt!, 100 is double the average package serve)


I figure that way you could see how they got the score, and if you care. Like, getting a bad score on calories means it's not nutrient dense, but you might not care. Or you might not care about such a high sodium if you rarely eat salt as is. Or about the cancer risk for smoked products, or what have you. I think the transparency would be better."
