politics,ffh4h70,t1_ffh22nc,1579922872.0,What do you mean? I don't like Bernie. But it was obvious that CNN was in the bag for Hillary in '16.
politics,ffh0fqd,t1_ffgrpt6,1579919782.0,I'm what way? They favoured her and even followed her suggestions to get trump the nomination.

CryptoCurrency,ffc98iw,t1_ffbdbmy,1579794435.0,He didn't actually set up the wallet if I've understood him correctly. It was gifted to him. So can't blame him if he didn't actually set it up.

For example, talking about record players and kids,  or when he's trying to give an example from his youth. He's def on his was to being seriously impaired the same was reagan was."
technology,ffay3rq,t1_ffafgzf,1579747174.0,Could be.  Maybe it's partially subsidised?

technology,ffadvnl,t1_ff9g7lg,1579733272.0,Yes because of districts. You have to register where you live so you can vote for local elections. It also prevents folks from very firmly republican or democratic areas from travelling to the swing states and influencing their local and national results.
technology,ffa8mqv,t1_ff9g8pm,1579730017.0,"What is the problem with Comcast? After living in Germany and having their shit internet for almost 3 years, they were a god send. Cheaper and faster than i had in Europe."
politics,ff9naif,t3_esbgdg,1579716571.0,The fact that Joe Biden is still taken as a serious candidate should tell you how bad the democratic party is. You can hear his brain fading every time he's on stage more than 30 mins. He rambles on and really sounds as if he's got dementia. I'm no fan of any of the dems but he's obviously the most mentally deteriorated of the three big names. It's time for him to retire.

nottheonion,ff6ds0t,t1_ff69511,1579624999.0,"Ahh because they make western Europe out to be a utopia for regular people. I'm not saying it's bad there, but American liberals would def have to adjust their lifestyles down as in not having the newest phone, eating out so much, having even less disposable income etc. I like to use internet access as an example, maybe anecdotal but here it is.  When i moved to Germany the only internet company which was state sponsored took at least 6 weeks to hook you up.  In some cases, my supervisor couldn't get a hook up because they didn't have more lines in his town. After this, having comcast in calfornia was a god send.

Now, American conservatives like to act as is Europe doesn't have some great things as well, but when it comes to infrastructure, America is so much better overall. People just need to understand that JUST Texas is bigger than every country in western Europe. So they try and compare the rural areas of America to say Germany, it's not really comparable."
nottheonion,ff6008a,t3_ernoxf,1579615579.0,"I'm convinced that American liberals have never actually lived anywhere overseas. Because all these places they go on and on about don't live three lifestyle Americans do. Europeans don't consume at anywhere near the rate we do, middle class taxes are substantially higher, and they also have a 20% VAT to deal with. 

Canada is a bit different, but some of their medical care is better, some of ours is better. You want faster treatment you go to the USA, cheaper you go to Canada."

Libertarian,ff5wjv6,t1_ff5fmnb,1579612641.0,"The free market isn't driving up costs there, it's the zoning laws, excessive need for state regulated permits and red tape, property taxes that favor people never selling their homes and being favourable to illegal immigration which is growing the population at an unsustainable rate."

CollegeBasketball,ff3b5er,t3_er5qpg,1579537743.0,"Ok so i haven't been able to keep up with the season because I've been moving from place to place and that type of thing, but wtf happened to UNC this year? They were like 6th at one point and they've lost like 6 in a row, to bad teams. They surely have the athletes to win these games?"
