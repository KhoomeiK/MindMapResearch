Didn’t get into a single college out of high school but got into a big ten college by doing that and getting a great gpa. I went very part time at first, like one or two classes to make sure I could do it and truly wanted it. It’s a long road that way, but at least I’m doing it. It’s weird being older, but honestly most people don’t care. I’ve learned more in 74 credits so far than the rest of my schooling combined. You can do it."
