TwoXChromosomes,ffxnm28,t3_evln4k,1580328788.0,"Fake. Don't you think if a Korean guy in LA led the police to 14 bodies and got sentenced to 2000 years it would make international news? Not a single Google result. The media can't bury public records of prosecutions. Journalists spend all day combing through them looking for stories. She's been a crack head for 4 decades and doesn't know what's real anymore. It's not that she's ""lying."" She believes it. She's just fried at this point. I have a cousin like this. You can be with them all day and then hear them tell someone some insane confabulated story about how they spent it that bears no semblance at all to what you just watched them do. I'm shocked no one else is saying this. You guys are really naive and gullible. When did feminism become blindly celebrating crazy drug addicted sex workers?"

E-thots acting like they earned success when they just happened to be born with a good body and can manipulate thirsty guys and cash in on social media money. In the old days they at least had to pick one rich guy to leech off. Now they can cast a net across the whole planet and rake in the bucks  on tiktok and instagram from like 16 years old which is just crazy.

AcademicPsychology,ffw13pn,t3_evhwyk,1580279950.0,"Actually there's a wealth of literature observing a positive correlation between owning cats and developing psychotic disorders... Particularly schizophrenia. It's thought to be from feline-born pathogen transmission. I'm guessing you saw the dog correlation with lifespan study on the front page yesterday? Don't worry about it that was a shit study. Correlation isn't causation and the title inferred a fallacious conclusion. Dogs don't make people live longer. It's that wealthy and white people are more likely to outlive poor and non white people while happening to own dogs. There's been a bunch of bull shit studies about owning horses too.

Is it that animals are some magical health remedy or is it just that people who are healthy  and wealthy enough to take care of an animal are also able to afford health insurance and probably be less likely to die anyway?  Bull shit useless study with a nonsense inferred conclusion.

Correlation is not causation. Let me rephrase the title of the article to more accurately convey these ""findings:"" 

""Sick and disabled people less likely to spend time and money on dogs""

or 

""Wealthy people more likely to outlive the poor and own dogs"""
confession,ffv8lrg,t1_ffv3736,1580258270.0,The very first article talks about how the studies were literally ghostwritten by pharma lobbyists and signed by academics. Learn to read you fucking retard. Clearly you already have such a dysfunctioning brain that you have nothing to lose by getting brain damage from these medications so don't bother hurting your little pea brain by trying to read them again.

confession,ffuxld5,t1_ffuualn,1580251270.0,"SSRIs only improve mental clarity if you're already addicted to them. Countless studies show they impair memory, concentration, and all critical thinking functions. It's like how heroin addicts need heroin to function but it would debilitate a non-addict. Except SSRIs are actually even more addicting and the withdrawal can last decades depending on how long you were on them."
