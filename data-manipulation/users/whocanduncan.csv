therewasanattempt,fgli9dj,t1_fgl9h5d,1580899137.0,My wife did one while she was pregnant and halfway through a course of chemo. I now hope I never have to do one.
politics,fgfl0is,t1_fgffpsl,1580741579.0,"As someone who's on the other side of the fence and can speak about public health from experience, it's amazing. My GP is free. They're open 7 days week, from 7am-10pm. I don't always get the same doctor, but I'm seen within half an hour. Only once I've waited longer.

As far as hospitals go, it's a little different. If it's not urgent, you do have to wait. Surgery for hip replacements and ACL tears (and many others) are typically at least 9 months. However, for anything life threatening you get shoved through at the speed of sound. My wife went from cancer diagnosis to treatment within 2 weeks. The only thing we paid for was parking. If you have private health insurance, you just get to wait in a fancier room."

nottheonion,fg89es6,t1_fg7kmm4,1580613083.0,"The stupid thing is that if you look at the example of the bible, there's a reoccurring theme where people in power abuse it, and people like Jesus live a modest life whilst radically defying the political status quo to help the poor, disenfranchised, destitute, outcasts, and the needy."
todayilearned,fg84ezp,t1_fg7x0xz,1580609246.0,"I live in Australia, and if a roundabout like that turned up down the road where I live, it would be fine. You don't need all of those things. Though give way signs would help. They normally go on the sides with the least traffic, but they're not always necessary. Stop signs serve a contrary purpose to a roundabout though, so that's weird. Probably the best thing to do in this case is make the centre island bigger so that people can't straight line through the intersection without slowing down."
todayilearned,fg83z00,t1_fg81kok,1580608906.0,It did include an unspecified amount of road repaving. So that's a bit misleading.
news,fg6ecgj,t1_fg63qdu,1580565461.0,"I skipped to the end of your comment because it read like the guy who always ends at ""plummeting 18ft to the ground in hell in a cell"" or whatever the quote is."
boomershumor,fg6co0o,t1_fg6b1ex,1580563835.0,"Well, i went 9 months without sex while my wife was pregnant/sick, and it's difficult. Nothing that would make me think about leaving her, but for someone with a relatively normal (I hope that doesn't offend you) sex drive, it adds a lot of quite unexpected strain, and it's something I only really noticed when it was gone."
slaythespire,fg67e8t,t1_fcqonps,1580557421.0,"Well, good to know. I've had a few killer runs as the Ironclad with a great strength synergy where I'd sometimes hit for 350 with heavey blade, so it's a shame it doesn't count."
Eyebleach,fg2bm2x,t1_fg275sq,1580441971.0,"I have a 4 month old baby, so we've recently done the research. The advice is to have a firm mattress, no pillows, blankets or teddies. Just the baby. Babies lose heat easily, so the advice for clothing is: give them the same as you, plus 1 layer.

Also, don't put socks/mittens on babies' hands because they're a choking hazard. Rather, prevent face scratching by cutting nails. Though, this is scary at first. We're really strict with our cats. If they ever hop in the cot they get yelled."
Eyebleach,fg1iofz,t1_fg1fpju,1580427811.0,"You're right, but there's a huge correlation between removing stuff that can smother a baby from its cot and reduction in SIDS. For the most part SIDS means ""your baby was smothered but we don't but you to feel guilty about your child's death""."

explainlikeimfive,ff2qrga,t1_ff22167,1579519809.0,"Depth of field is like a 1 lens version of  of normal vision. It would be more realistic to have 2 overlapping and out of focus images for the background, but I think that'd be a bit much. Personally I like depth of field because it helps add the 3rd dimension, but I get why you don't like it. I like when games allow you to set custom amounts of blue effects."

pics,fei4lte,t1_fehsr24,1579130163.0,"Thars nice and all, but the doctrine of Jesus isn't preaching fire and brimstone, its about bringing love/hope (read: heaven) to people living in hell on earth. And it's a bit too hard for many Christians to help people now when they can satisfy their conscious by telling people to repent for a life after they die. Actually helping people is hard."

LifeProTips,fdjp2um,t1_fdjotiz,1578481705.0,That's a smart thing to do. And you can always mention it to someone who is in the position to help without looking suspicious.
LifeProTips,fdjfdce,t1_fdj32gs,1578468442.0,"It's part of why ""stranger danger"" is a bad mantra. You want your kids to approach an adult for help if they're lost, but you need to teach them who ""safe people"" are, people like security guards, other families, bus drivers, people who work at shops etc, rather than staying by themselves where someone ill-intended might find an opportunity."
