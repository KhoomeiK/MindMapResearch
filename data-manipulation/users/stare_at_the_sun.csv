Have you considered discussing this further with him? Not to accuse him of anything necessarily, but to see how far he pushes it... if his younger brother tells him he is *grossed out* maybe he’ll hear you... but in my experience these types of men do not listen to anyone. I have had things happen with the type of guy you describe and they have messed me and my life up hugely."

Need to show this to him so he stops thinking I am just nagging or being uptight about things. It is so unfair that men get to be cavemen and then women are expected to be at the standard stated above (more often than them). Standard of living conditions and taking care of yourself reflect a lot"
