intermittentfasting,ffluc1j,t3_etzpif,1580044311.0,Yup! I don’t know how many days I’ve been doing IF but not that long. Just completed an egg fast for 3 days which had some rules about eating eggs within 30 minutes of waking up so I broke my fast. Starting back up again today though!
AskReddit,ffjscnp,t1_ffj62zq,1580005634.0,"This has happened on numerous occasions with me and my 5 year old. I’m bipolar and the lows can be really hard but whenever that time comes and I’m a sobbing disaster, he gives me a big hug and a kiss. It always makes me feel better."
ketorecipes,ffjqcba,t1_ffjp75m,1580004253.0,"Broccoli, asparagus, cauliflower, or a side salad?"
stopdrinking,ffia08e,t3_etqcu9,1579968885.0,"You can do this. I’m a SAHM of two - 5 years and 10 months. I was cheating my kids by drinking and I finally said no more. Day one was the hardest. But once it passes, you don’t have to repeat day one again. It gets easier... up to 10 days for alcohol to leave your system so expect negative side effects as your body detoxes itself. Be gentle and forgive yourself.

We’ll be here for you everyday to offer support! Iwndwyt"
progresspics,ffi6n9y,t3_etrb7b,1579966489.0,Looking amazing! Totally in love with your hair too. How’d you do it?
Parenting,ffhuiut,t3_etktfu,1579954544.0,"Before I got pregnant at 25 (31 now with not one but TWO kiddos!), I always said “nope never having kids sorry mom and dad”. I just couldn’t relate to them and found them obnoxious. 

Then in the Spring of 2014 I met my husband and that summer we fell in love. Low and behold, we realized we were pregnant. Shocked and in disbelief we didn’t know what to do. It was my first pregnancy scare, I had never even used a pregnancy test up until that point. 

Fast forward almost 6 years and my two children are the best things that ever happened to me, and I’m not just saying that. I found my purpose in life with them. I finally knew what I was meant to be doing with myself! Now I pride myself on being the best mom I can be."
stopdrinking,ffg8b39,t3_et9qqh,1579900626.0,Congrats!
tattoos,ffdvvqy,t3_esw82p,1579830223.0,"This is amazing! Side note, our doggies could be twins! We have a Parsons Jack Russell mix too but we’re not sure what he’s mixed with. I plan to get a dog DNA kit soon and find out."
lowcarb,ffdvhjf,t3_esylia,1579829944.0,I’ve made something similar and it was delicious! Yours looks yummy too. I bet it’s very filling!
StardewValley,ffc8b92,t1_ffc87i0,1579793840.0,Yeah if you could photocopy the original that’d be easier on your hand!
StardewValley,ffc849f,t3_eso6z3,1579793714.0,This is such a cute idea and the notebook is adorable! I love how the pages are set up. I wish you could make these and sell them.
progresspics,ffav7j8,t3_ertdum,1579745260.0,"Lookin’ good! Nice job dude! I have a question for ya... what did you eat to gain weight and muscle mass while you worked out? My husband has talked about wanting to gain mass but he says no matter what he eats, he doesn’t gain weight."
thewitcher3,ff7jqhn,t3_ervjme,1579651175.0,"Happy birthday! The Witcher 3 is one of my favorite ways to wind down and spend the evening once my kids are asleep. 

Btw, noticed you have an SNES classic! Those are tons of fun. We live ours"
stopdrinking,ff4wfro,t3_ermzoy,1579574078.0,Congrats!
stopdrinking,ff31j8f,t3_er8d79,1579531214.0,"So glad to hear it! I was in your shoes too. I’m so sad I missed out on years of valuable time with my son. Now I’ve got two kids to spend this precious time with and by not drinking, my attention is completely on them and ensuring we have the most quality time together that we can. These two need a good mother and I feel like I’m finally that to them.
