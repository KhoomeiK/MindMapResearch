—

(Practically speaking, the reason HSI hasn’t been folded into the FBI is because the FBI is a domestic law enforcement agency, and HSI primarily coordinates with other countries to investigate international crimes.)

FYI:

> U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was formed under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, following the events of September 11, 2001. With the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security, the functions and jurisdictions of several border and revenue enforcement agencies were combined and consolidated into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Consequently, ICE is the largest investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security and the second largest contributor to the nation's Joint Terrorism Task Force.

>The agencies that were either moved entirely or merged in part into ICE included the criminal investigative and intelligence resources of the United States Customs Service, the criminal investigative, detention and deportation resources of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Federal Protective Service. The Federal Protective Service was later  transferred from ICE to the National Protection and Programs Directorate effective October 28, 2009."

A big part of the problem is that prosecutors have basically no oversight and there’s no mechanism to stop them from imposing double standards and/or just being corrupt af."
politics,fgofew0,t1_fgo8ihb,1580968107.0,">Republican senators ... know they are cornered

Wut? Cornered by who? 

I’m not sure your feet are on the ground here. I applaud your optimism, I guess, but republican senators acted exactly as they believe best serves their interests. 

Where are the indications that Mitch McConnell- / Trump-style know-nothing, power whore shitbaggery has or will stop working anytime soon? I don’t see it. 

I actually think Romney showed legit integrity taking this stand, but it’s very clear that he just set fire to any future aspirations in the Republican Party as we know it. The National Review / GHW Bush wing of the party capitulated to the slack jawed, pussy grabbing, propaganda swilling wing a long, long time ago."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fgjwnm1,t1_fgiy7sm,1580852838.0,"Be prepared that if you exercise your right to remain silent, even when done with extreme deference and apparent “respect” — although this is very often the best course of action in the long run — you run a very strong risk of angering the officer(s) you’re dealing with, and that can have unpleasant consequences. 

Cops almost always employ the “tell the truth and I’ll make it easier on you” strategy to get people to incriminate themselves, and it usually works, because people are intimidated and/or make the mistake of believing a cop. When you short circuit this strategy it can really piss them off."

I’d love to reply to your comment, but I have no idea what you’re on about. If you could be more clear, that’d be helpful.

Despite its youth, and despite human fallibility and hubris, doctors and scientists aren’t “just guessing.” They know more about medicine and anatomy than random people on the internet."

Despite the noises republicans make about liberty and small government, one of their favorite things is chipping away at the Bill of Rights, giving more power to law enforcement over the individual, and imposing their so-called “morals” and “religious liberties” on everyone else."

But The American Way: Assume that poverty must be a moral failing. 

People ignore the minefield of poor taxes that overworked/underpaid people have to navigate. It’s fucking expensive being poor.

Also: if you’re poor and trying to be less poor, having a serviceable smart phone with a good case is the best investment you can make in your future. It’s a computer in your pocket. You can apply to jobs 24/7, immediately respond to emails, send a fax, turn a PDF around, network ... knocking a poor person for having a working smart phone is fucking ignorant."

But even with an aerobee in perfect conditions I was maxing out at ~70 yards. 

At that distance Wally would track way out to the sidelines, track back in, and still high-point the disc easily. When he’d run in a straight line and wait for the disc to fall/barely jump it was far less exciting to watch (kinda like in this clip)."
MurderedByWords,ffmtnpe,t1_ffmbewb,1580058749.0,"I can’t speak to your particular experience, but as a rule, conditions and pay improve in direct relation to how much power employees have.

It sounds like you’re in a much better situation now, and that’s great. Looking over the stories in this thread I’m still left feeling that workers need more power, not less, and they need to be more fairly compensated for the value they create for their employers. 

If workers can consolidate power and improve conditions and wages by starting employee owned businesses, great. Failing that, having the protection and advocacy of a union is better than being at the mercy of a merciless system."
