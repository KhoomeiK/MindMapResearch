Those enlisted early also reach the front lines at a disproportionate rate to their same age peers. They're also more vulnerable to suicide, PTSD, Depression, and other mental health issues.

AskUK,ffixshi,t3_etv3pb,1579985334.0,"Generally etiquette dictates that, if the car is at a reasonable price and there is no nonsense going on, you assume that the price wanted by the dealer is 10% below the asking price, so starting the haggling at 15% less than asking is perfectly reasonable and will not raise an eyebrow.

A cheeky chancer (or rude bastard) can and will offer considerably less, some offering 50% of the asking price. This will likely get you hung up on or told to leave, but 20% is a reasonable place to start as well unless the price is already a good one.

On a £5000 car you can safely offer £4250, knowing that you're only £250 under what they really want, but again this all depends on the quality of the car and the going rate for an example like the one you're viewing.

Certain things will lower the value from the rough average like only having one key, dents or rust, a poor interior, a bad MOT history, NO v5 present (don't buy one of those dear god), poor or mismatched tyres, no service history, high mileage, trashed alloy wheels, etcetera.

Basically the best advice is to call up and ask a few questions like ""when was the timing belt last changed/are there two keys/how did it do on the last MOT/how are the tyres looking"". They're all perfectly reasonable and expected questions, and when viewing the car in person double check all those things *before haggling*.

If someone doesn't have answers at a dealership or garage etc it doesn't mean they are hiding something, it likely means they deal with a lot of cars and can't remember.

Take each positive and negative in hand, and assume that something needs doing to all cars within the next year. 

Very few cars are sold in perfect condition, the reason cars are being sold is usually because an MOT is coming up and they know the clutch is feeling dodgy or it'll need welding soon. Maybe the interior isn't as good as it used to be, or this last winter the passenger footwell got really wet. This goes for almost all price categories of car. Instead of fixing what is wrong with your car, you dump it as someone else's problem and buy a brand new unknown quantity.

TLDR: offer 20-15% less than asking and haggle to about 10% less than asking. If something seems off walk away. Take a friend who is savvy to give the car a rough once over. If it seems too good to be true it probably is."

The only treatment that works for gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder is to transition to the persistently identified gender.

Every other treatment has been tried; chemical castration, lobotomy, electro shock therapy, conversion therapy, aversion therapy, negative association, taking bromine, hormone balancing, a slew of medications, ""gender affirmation""... Nothing works.

If someone has psychosis, a persistent or repeated skew or hallucinations, there are anti psychotics that control the issue. If someone believes they are possessed by the devil we can treat that.

The only effective treatment for trans people is to be treated as the gender they identify with. Brain scans show healthy brains that have structures that match the gender they identify with, not the types tied to their biological assignation at birth.

Unhealthy brains show differences in brain scans. Depression shows atrophy, but trans brains are just healthy brains with no weird anomalies except they are, for all intents and purposes, gendered with the identity they report.

I live roughly five miles from docked and sailing ships, and genuinely you can hear what it is. The hull of the ships acts like a drum skin, and the water carries the sound exceedingly well.

Ships engines rotate at a very low RPM, often in the low hundreds whilst being thousands of litres of cubic capacity. They produce a very very low sound, and having been on ships when they start up, it reverberates right through you, and can be heard from miles away. You almost feel it more than hear it.

My grandfather would sit in normal conversation and suddenly interject ""they've started up a ship's engine, can you hear it?"" I could indeed, but being younger it would take me longer to hear it because I would have to focus to find it.
