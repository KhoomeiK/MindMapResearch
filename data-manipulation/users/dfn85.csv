UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,fddq2vf,t1_fdd0de4,1578320929.0,"Some brands do make dry shampoo for dark hair.  It has color in it, though, so I don’t know if that’ll transfer off onto clothes or whatnot.  Or you could make your own with cornstarch and cocoa powder.  There are all sorts of instructions online.

I noticed you’re not the person I originally replied to, so I’ll ask this.  How often do you wash your hair?  If it’s everyday, that’s often too much.  Shampoo strips out dirt and oils, but your skin needs it’s own oils as a barrier against the elements.  So, your scalp then overproduces more, leaving your hair greasy.  Fair warning, if you do cut back, your hair will get worse for a bit until your body gets used to it."

Spray some dry shampoo wherever it’s greasy, tousle it in a bit to help absorb the oil, and brush through thoroughly.  Be careful if you have really dark hair, though.
