AskAnAmerican,ffi2lfi,t3_etqi4f,1579963243.0,"My first real job was writing software in the mid-80’s at a company that made peripherals for various microcomputers. Funnest job I ever had. The wars between new electronics was often won and lost by being first to market and reputation, and the better machine didn’t always win. The two largest  market niches were for general office computers and “creative” computers. The first group didn’t really need great graphics, as the clientele had previously been using mainframes; moreover, purchasing departments preferred established companies as their suppliers (“Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM”). The second group was won by Apple - they had the first good micro out years ahead of Commodore and again won the race with the Lisa and Mac. Most customers were satisfied with good B&W graphics then. The Amiga’s graphics were second to none, but they had lost the race and could only win markets that seriously needed state of the art graphics. No good third-party software base developed and they were doomed."

There are states that were once Democratic strongholds that are now solidly Republican, and vice-versa. New York and California are two examples of states that were once Republican, but are now lost to them for the foreseeable future. On the other hand you can look at Alabama. It took the Republicans over 100 years to carry it even once, and now it’s one of their strongest states."

When Nixon’s people were called before Congress to explain what was going on, they all perjured themselves, flatly telling Congress that the reports were false. The campaign led to the downfall of Head of State Prince Sianhouk, and then Nixon’s local strongman, Lon Nol.

Here’s an ELI5: Housing starts are a coincident indicator because tell you what’s going on right now; Building permits are a leading indicator, because they indicate what is planned for a few months from now. Both numbers are pretty noisy, so you should ignore monthly numbers and focus instead on rolling averages. If the rolling average for the permits drops to 20% below the recent high, that’s a major recession flag. We’re nowhere near that atm. Also, you can have recession without a serious housing slump.

The big problem economically had been inflation, mostly caused by the too-easy monetary policies of Fed Chairs Burns and Miller, which was belatedly addressed by Carter with the appointment of Volcker in late ‘79. Volcker throttled the money supply, forcing the ‘80 recession, and had it under control by early ‘81. Unfortunately, Reagan’s first rich guy tax cut in ‘81 then re-stoked the fire, and Volcker had to force the ‘82 recession, getting it all worked out just in time for Reagan’s re-election.
As for the Cold War, the USSR was clearly in trouble by 1981 and it was the death of the older generation (Brezhnev, etc.) that allowed people to come to power who were willing to face the reality of it. Reagan’s defense buildup may have accelerated the process, but it was inevitable.
