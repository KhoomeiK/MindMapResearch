>
>Help me understand your logic please... thanks!

1. Advil is available over the counter. The Pill is not.
2. A headache is for a temporary minor ache. The pill is for a chronic condition--whether that's having endometriosis or one of another ailments, or whether it's for simply being fertile. If your headache was chronic, there is a decent chance you wouldnt be on Advil for it. Youd be on a prescription.
3. The implications of not making borth control convenient and easily accessible gets messy. The Pill isnt cheap, and until you can get more men (and women, admittedly) to be ok with condoms, just saying that's a magic bullet wont work. Besides, condoms break. If you're on the Pill, you can fuck up once (forget a pill) and be ok. If you're relying on condoms and fuck up once, you may as well have never used them at all. 

This doesnt even take into account IUDs and other forms of set it and forget it birth cotnrol.

If these companies dont want to cover these services, they lose the right to say ""But muh faith!"" And heres why.

The most effective forms of birth control are the same ones that are the most unaffordable. By forcing people to rely on less reliable forms on a catch-as-catch-can basis, they're actually *increasing* the number of abortions. At this point, their objection to birth control because they claim it is an abortifacent falls completely apart. Particularly because a lot of the people who would no longer have cheap and convenient birth control are *married women.* Married women are not only ALLOWED to have lots of sex by moral codes. The Bible *specifically commands it.*

What do you think is going to happen if Jane's work stops covering the Pill and a condom breaks while she is having sex with her husband? Imagine they're not financially well off and they have three kids already...

If we are going to say employers dont have to cover birth control, then someone else needs to provide affordable birth control. Otherwise the abortion rate WILL go up. People by and large have less disposable income--we cant realistically think they are going to forego food, their car, clothes for their kids, or a cell phone to pay for the expensive-ass pill (which also requires a doctor's appointment, at $150 bucks a pop plus potentially lost wages) when they think they can keep track of things with a pen and a calendar. The only other option is to try and encourage husbands to stop having sex with their wives once theyve had all the kids they can afford...which, good luck with that.

If a man cant pick up his laundry, it is incumbent on the man to improve, rather than on the woman to change her opinion.

That's basically what you're doing here. You're ignoring the fact that the way we socialize men is legitimately problematic, and trying to make the problem instead the fact that women are finally saying ""no, fuck that.""

A lot of the things being said here can be substantiated. Science has verified that men suck in these ways. If you dont like that, the answer isnt to create more compliant women--after all, dirty dishes will still attract pests, poorly handled laundry will mold/spoil/ruin clothes, and women who have to do all the household work will continue to suffer ill health as a result of the overwork and stress. If you dont like it, you wont fix it by bitching about it here. You'll fix it by *making men better.*"
