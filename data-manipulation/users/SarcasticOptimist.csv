Android,ffsxvrr,t1_ffsjo7g,1580197055.0,Synology or QNAP NAS and some 3rd party cameras. As for security sensors maybe r/homeautomation can help with z wave stuff.
Android,ffsxqcy,t1_ffsbr5z,1580196861.0,Amazon backs it iirc. And when the main alternative is 60 a month (adt) instead of 100 a year it makes sense. And it takes effort to assemble third party noncloud equipment that will work together that still respects privacy. I'm using it for the doorbell and basic door/window sensing. Definitely would not trust it with internal cameras.
natureismetal,ffsx9h5,t1_ffsrncb,1580196260.0,I don't see those insects buying a Mustang with 30% APR.
ItemShop,ffsn188,t3_euw9oz,1580185899.0,This also gives you the Stonks perk of I remember right. It gives a higher probability to buy low and sell high.
Tinder,ffsm5mi,t1_ffrnjwm,1580185191.0,There's two versions both good. Though the electric has an awesome solo. And if you're in Seattle the guitar used to record that is on display at the pop culture museum.
cats,ffsfe67,t1_ffs36ni,1580180361.0,Mine isn't blind (only one eye) but I remember seeing blind cats being in this sub and asking one owner on special ways not to startle it. Iirc not changing furniture positions is a big one.

cats,ffr7gax,t1_ffr3q0c,1580152105.0,"Outside of getting chonky (parents go more heavy than I'd like on wet food, and probably low exercise) he's generally fine. Still makes precise leaps."
Throwers,ffr6pl5,t1_ffr0ge6,1580151637.0,Yeah it is. The One Third is plastic responsive. The Node or YYA are metal non. Good to have both. Some yoyos can be adjusted via bearings to do both but given the price it's more convenient to order two and swap between them. Don't forget to order string.
cats,ffr3hnw,t1_ffr2jw1,1580149646.0,It's sown shut by the ophthalmologist. Recovery is surprisingly quick (my cat was 5) taking two weeks. Biggest issue is making sure litter boxes are open and easy to access.
StardewValley,ffr275x,t1_ffqk4op,1580148837.0,"r/succulents is really active and helpful too.

Herbs like basil, thyme, and rosemary survive my inexperienced hands."
StardewValley,ffr1ut2,t1_ffn3z32,1580148622.0,That looks cool. Though I have nearly every space occupied with barrels (with a handful of lights) so that many sprinklers is overkill. The trees do a good job covering up that flaw.
Throwers,ffr0cxy,t1_ffobvxk,1580147676.0,Yeah. The D2 aka the One Third is a good one. I'd grab a non responsive like a Y01 Node or a Yoyoapartment one since the shipping takes a while too.
sousvide,ffqxl4b,t1_ffq13kl,1580145919.0,Neat. I'll try this method then. No issue with high temperatures near 160F?
ABoringDystopia,ffqx722,t1_ffqw8j3,1580145669.0,"If anything having fewer people is probably a blessing given the drain on natural resources.

StardewValley,ffq7jcl,t1_ffpoc49,1580124616.0,Even though I hadn't I still don't particularly sympathize with him. There's even a dialogue with Emily post 8 heart event wondering why Clint isn't friendly with her any more.
StardewValley,ffq7fgd,t1_ffpnlz5,1580124466.0,Mine even perks up when he hears the cat meow.
StardewValley,ffq782w,t1_ffpszr0,1580124177.0,Yeah. I burned through so many ninjas getting an ancient fruit winery up.

Animemes,ffp6fhi,t1_ffnc7u4,1580087413.0,Better than the Aaron Hernandez documentary I'm watching. Even though he was bi...it'd be terrible to hang with him.
hiphopheads,ffp04ye,t1_ffnwtcp,1580083875.0,Or charter planes. It seems like it's a common way for the rich to pass away.
hiphopheads,ffp02sm,t1_ffnyyq2,1580083846.0,Same. I drive by and use that airport all the time. So surreal.
sousvide,ffoyk4x,t1_ffns8dp,1580083333.0,Mix of energy cost but mostly speeding getting up to temperature.
sousvide,ffoygdk,t1_ffmwz8h,1580083283.0,Yeah those were the ones I mentioned. My cambro is a bit smaller. I'm thinking an insulated bag might work. I'll bring it to Costco and Trader Joe's.
StardewValley,ffmksjl,t1_ffmhmfs,1580055992.0,Mines. It's that boulder on the right. Break it up and you can talk with him if you donated all scrolls to the museum and get a translator guide.
StardewValley,ffmjpom,t1_ffmh98b,1580055627.0,"Cool. Give to the museum, plant in the greenhouse, and have a seed maker nearby. With patience you'll be loaded."
StardewValley,ffmhsj9,t3_eu6ld6,1580054832.0,"You'll love iridium sprinklers. Only four spaces occupied if you use the edges. Check the wiki.

I have two nearby sheds. One for preserves and the other for kegs."
StardewValley,ffmh2cz,t3_eu0hcq,1580054599.0,I gave them both eggplants. They'll find it handy. Lewis liked it more than Marnie.

BuyItForLife,ffkn1hp,t3_et6cia,1580025454.0,Nice. I paid 60 for it a while back. Seems to be a reputable company and the Netflix feature is handy. It didn't work in China when I was in Shanghai though.
BuyItForLife,ffkmlro,t3_ety8ju,1580025247.0,"r/goodyearwelt might help. Used Allen Edmonds are relatively affordable and the right models can be resoled.

Sneaker wise there's New Balance 990s aka the dad sneaker. Brooks and ASICS marathon related shoes are long lasting. Topos Runventure too if you want zero drop."

Android,ffk00gb,t1_ffjfnur,1580011666.0,Yeah. If possible I also like sticking a NAS in a parent's house that can connect to the cloud so you have another off-site backup. Then you can visit and quickly grab all your stuff too in case it gets damaged. And potentially save your parents from themselves.
SubredditDrama,ffjwxrh,t1_ffixjwm,1580009212.0,"Besides this, Gwen Stefanis Hollaback Girl, and peanut butter jelly time what else was B A N A N A S?"
tech,ffjwqj3,t1_ffj0saj,1580009051.0,"That's probably because of the brand name/hype. Nissan Leafs (though the first gen is awful), Chevy Bolt/Volt, and maybe Hyundai Ioniq could be affordable used. Especially since newer models will have better range and performance as companies get used to the new tech and its limits."
DiWHY,ffjnutk,t1_ffiog7f,1580002579.0,I can see this working with a solid midi controller and studio monitors making that sound.
PoliticalDiscussion,ffiajin,t1_ffhy1kf,1579969258.0,No kidding. Parkland showed that that generation is willing and able to do large scale rallies. This kind of environment why a gun control position isn't political poison any more.

StardewValley,ffee92f,t3_esz67l,1579844760.0,Ah. Clever. I use color codes. Black for building materials. Blue for fishing. Green for seeds. Grey for gems. But yours is more versatile.
StardewValley,ffedbmw,t1_ffd7wfi,1579843856.0,Tap often on your phone. That works for me. A well timed tap will prevent bouncing too.
StardewValley,ffed3be,t1_ffd1m76,1579843639.0,Don't worry. Outside of supercucumbers you won't deal with this on a regular basis. Trout soup is your friend.

StardewValley,ffcxlf6,t3_esy8iu,1579809374.0,Demetrius gave me a beer. So I liked him for that. Way better than glass shards at the beach or tree sap.
StardewValley,ffcpepw,t1_ffcaiwg,1579804393.0,Yeah. That's why they have beef during Krobus' heart event.
StardewValley,ffcn65t,t1_fcz6e3g,1579803009.0,I usually keep it by the bus since it'll be easier to retrieve should you pass out.

worldnews,ffbcpg3,t1_ffb3j3s,1579759842.0,Reddit is ground zero for many memes. Many banned subs were basically those inside jokes like baby talking about genocide (frenworld) and the_Donald as its epicenter.
StardewValley,ffadjez,t1_ffa3eh0,1579733018.0,No one seems to be lactose intolerant. Though Kent gets ptsd with goat and sashimi.
specializedtools,ff9q7n5,t1_ff7zj6h,1579718531.0,Frank Horwath is also a phenomenal wood worker and part time stop motion animator.  Though you'll need an arsenal of tools to keep up.

StardewValley,ff9gon7,t3_es7af7,1579712628.0,I'd keep your basement as pure casks. As it's the only place they work as intended.

StardewValley,ff9enkp,t1_ff8nfjo,1579711378.0,Might need to do that way to get to 100 (keep sleeping at 90). As mobile since the farmer constantly spams attack when they're crumpled.
technology,ff97fx9,t1_ff92bry,1579706606.0,No kidding. If I were him I'd make an Amazon messaging system to spite them. And probably mine more info too through it and Alexa integration.
suspiciouslyspecific,ff8d63v,t1_ff82im6,1579673603.0,r/pihole so all devices like wifi tvs aren't doing the same to you too. And if you're tech oriented pfsense.

MurderedByWords,ff7v4ue,t1_ff7s1yg,1579659092.0,"Yeah I included the Snopes article to show its unneeded. Routinely done by people who believe otherwise.

And totally agree with the second paragraph. Third one I'm not sure either. Afghanistan was to avenge American lives from 9/11. Pearl Harbor was purely military/a tactical decision. Most military action in the 20th century and onwards were colonial actions with minimal impact at home."
