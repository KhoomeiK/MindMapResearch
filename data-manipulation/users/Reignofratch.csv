There is literally almost no common situation where you rear-ended someone and you are not an asshole who did something wrong.

It really depends on what kind of information is being conveyed.

Internal dialog only works in a book, but regular dialog is so much better in film. Imagine if clerks was a book. It would be awful. The pacing and banter make it great.

The Lord of the rings is a boring book to many and often they find it more entertaining to watch. This is due to the lengthy scenery descriptions being cut down to a two second camera pan past some scenery. This is one of many advantages visual media has.

It's fully a 50/50 thing, but no one likes to talk about movies that are better than the books. And often they shouldn't be compared due to being too different and achieving different things. If you judge a movie by the books merits, of course it will fail."

I used to work and live 15 miles away across the city from my school. That's a 3 hour public transit, due to multiple connections.
