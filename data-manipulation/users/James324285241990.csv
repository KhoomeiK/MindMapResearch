Each and every one of us has served in wartime.  Most of us in combat. Enlisted ground pounders,  helicopter pilots,  NCOs, and high ranking officers. Both American and foreign allied military.  I know plenty. 




Our system is broken. We used to have private companies develop technology which we would then pick and choose from. Now,  we pay each of a dozen different companies to do the same thing,  and go with the one that finishes first,  often times resulting in shitty and unreliable equipment that hinders readiness and lethality. 



Further,  more focus has been placed on PR and recruitment to continue fueling our mercenary status than on retention and quality of life for our service members. A shockingly large number of troop and veteran suicides are committed by folks that never saw combat.  The SYSTEM broke them. 




We contract private companies on a cost-plus basis for EVERYTHING. You know what that means? It means they don't send extra brake pads with that fuel truck. When they wear out,  they torch the whole truck, buy another one,  and charge Uncle Sam 15% on top for their troubles.
