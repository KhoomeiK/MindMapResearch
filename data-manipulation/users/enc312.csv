Baking,ff6bw01,t3_eruuy5,1579623811.0,"From a looks standpoint, you could do quite a few things. Maybe play with the texture of the icing, by using a palette knife, or do a basketweave treatment. Add coconut shreds/flakes (if he's into that, and not allergic, of course), sprinkle large sugar crystals over it, sprinkle white sprinkles over it, maybe do some nice white piping (something related to one of his hobbies, or a favorite sport or movie, whatever), stuff like that. These ideas would leave the integrity of the cake and icing recipes (virtually) intact, but add visual interest.
