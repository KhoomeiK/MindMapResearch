Vent,fef1p7e,t1_feeiyv1,1579046101.0,So don't leave spawn and kill those fuckers in the spawn room lmao
Vent,feamqg6,t1_fe490si,1578950367.0,Thank you so much.
Vent,feamo69,t1_fe4tijo,1578950348.0,I sure hope so
Vent,feal378,t3_eoa15s,1578949989.0,"Well it's completely understandable as mercy is not only support, but she's a rather scary support as she not only provides defensive support, but offensive as well. It's normal for Mercy's to be singled out as she is a truly scary support even after her nerf. If you find yourself singled out, just try your best to use the angel fly to a teammate who is far or away from the threat, and if you are in a group, instead of supporting, try to provide cover fire with the gun to flankers like Reaper as her gun is stronger."

Vent,fe46zv2,t1_fe46u25,1578856366.0,I'm so scared of it happening again.

depression,fcnvhcu,t1_fcnicq6,1577819242.0,"I went home..I couldn't work properly, but my dad yelled at me this morning because the dog is sick and I was at a friend's place instead of at home, he told me I was irresponsible, and it's all just bad luck. I don't have many friends and recently found she was nearby so we hang out last night and only that night and he woke me up this morning at 6 maybe 6:30 yelling at me and telling me that I was irresponsible. I'm more depressed the dog is sick, but after years and so much effort it's just all diminished into nothing because I have a friend and that's a bad thing apparently."
depression,fcnv79f,t1_fcnipxy,1577819081.0,I just went home..
helpme,fcnv67g,t1_fcnqqv4,1577819063.0,I know it because it's been happening for years after years and nothing has changed.
helpme,fcnhtn4,t1_fcmg30k,1577812007.0,"Give it a week or two, I'll just be in the same dark and endless abyss of despair, right where I started. If giving it time means another 10 years and then another after that I'm not sure if anything is worth it."

depression,fcgr721,t3_eh41bc,1577643199.0,"The thing that makes it worse is that you have to be the one to decide to initiate the contact and it's anxious and bothering to make a decision like that. It makes the feeling of being annoying, the feeling of being a burden and a bother even worse because people don't tell you when they can talk, or people don't talk to you and you're just left with the notion that they literally have no will to deal with you. 

My best friends and I talk once every 5 or 6 months to a year and it's usually only 3 or 4 short lived messages. And she's my best friend. The amount of people that can pretend they care about you, and are there for you then just disappear without a trace or warning, leaving you in the abyss of wondering what you did wrong and if you should even bother them again sucks. It just means they think of you as pestering or a chore when you've done nothing wrong. 

Waiting months for replies, and losing friends by seconds is so constant the hurt and pain of being alone and abandoned..it's just the normal, default feeling now."
