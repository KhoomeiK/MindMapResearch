IAmA,ffxtg9t,t3_evr0ec,1580332082.0,I’ve quit smoking several times throughout my life via the “cold turkey” method.  One example: I quit when I became pregnant after smoking for five os six years.   I started again about five years later during my divorce.  Stress is usually the reason I start up again.  The lasttime I quit was a little over two years ago.   How can someone like me combat those sorts of stress triggers?

Just because a woman decides to what?... stay at home after children, it doesn’t mean their work is invalid.  Also, plenty of men are becoming the primary caregivers while their wives make the bread.  The fact that you think a woman professional who doesn’t have kids won’t “educate” anyone is the most offensive of all. If she doesn’t have kids than she’s not contributing towards anything?  What!? Just, what?"
