nutrition,fe34uoc,t1_fe1y3o6,1578845922.0,Yeah my grandma smoked from 14 to 96 not one bout of cancer or lung disease. Clearly smoking is okay
nutrition,fdoodqs,t1_fdoi7k1,1578609292.0,"Nitrates + heat and amino acids are correlated with higher cancer risk. Nitrates/nitrites turn to nitrous and can help lower blood pressure. Also side note if you take mouthwash after eating something high in nitrates, say beets or celery, it can stop the BP lowering effects."

Yeah I have some buildings that dont, definitely more than a few high rises that you can even see the clip slide over time ( the wear marks). I actually had a building that otis pinned the final limit to the rail and it came down with the rail into the  rail bracket and when I took it off during a mod it fucking sprang off down the hoist way because of the pressure hahaha"
todayilearned,fc9ae9m,t1_fc97nb1,1577549617.0,Haha what a logistical nightmare.
todayilearned,fc97git,t1_fc95zwj,1577548245.0,Wow. Ha and I was complaining about my 7  5/8 cable change job when I was on mods. Can't imagine shackling a 1 inch cable... no way they use normal field installed wedge shackles do they? I can't imagine being able to seat the cable properly
Elevators,fc948u3,t1_fc8z73u,1577546783.0,You weld the brackets to the rails instead of using rail clips?
todayilearned,fc92eax,t1_fc7r7zc,1577545923.0,"Oh my good jesus you aren't kidding. That's insane honestly. The machines I have on these cars are absolutely massive, I would love to see those ones. God that must be a maintenance guys nightmare hahaha"
todayilearned,fc7nkgq,t1_fc7azbc,1577513445.0,"One of my new builds that just turned over has 2 1600 fpm cars with the third fire service car at 1200 because the building wanted it ""turned down for reliablility"". Mind boggling to ride on"
todayilearned,fc7nbkv,t1_fc7cuo2,1577513181.0,"I've seen a building that didnt shim the bottom of the guide rails, (you're supposed to leave a gap so the rails can collapse with the building) and it causes the rails to bulge and the elevator wedged into the tight point and got stuck. No clue how they fixed it, but it was glorious to see."
todayilearned,fc7n4g3,t1_fc7csuj,1577512969.0,"As abraksis said, yes. Most of the time. There are machine brakes that can hold the car at higher than rated load as well as perform stopping at no load. There is a governor to stop runaway cars as well. But the ""most"" dangerous scenario is simply empty car up runaway. In these cases most new elevators have either a rope clamping device or some sort of emergency drive brake.

You're much less likely to get hurt than the techs working on them, by far. And techs aren't scared of the machines."
funny,f9op8zv,t1_f9o3cw7,1575510118.0,Yeah the biggest issue is him getting his little shoe stuck in the skirting beside the treads. There are no stop switches in the middle there so I always find shoes/slippers etc that get sucked in
