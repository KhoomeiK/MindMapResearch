Also, never forget that she dug through private medical information so she could announce to the public that Method Man's wife had cancer before they even got to tell her family.

She's a rotten cunt and should be barred from the public eye."

You don't make an argument by telling someone to go prove themselves wrong instead of making the point yourself, and regardless of whatever it is you're peddling, they are talking about the verified batshit insane government, not race.

Trump's a steaming pile of dog shit, but both sides of politics had their butts in those plane seats in the way to rape island.  Alleged Rapist Bill Clinton went there several times, but let's make it an ""our side vs yours"" issue instead of the ""lynch the ruling class"" issue that it should be."

AskReddit,fcxiy9z,t3_ejdlbw,1578064088.0,A close friend of mine using intimate knowledge about my mental state to say what he thought would be as hurtful to me as possible over an absolutely petty argument that was his fault to begin with.  Bonus points that 90% of what he said was him projecting because he was in a worse but similar state to me just a few months prior.  The fact that he went where he did over nothing made me outright despise him though.  Went from willing to take a bullet for him to wanting to shoot him.

funny,fcvbk0f,t1_fcuux3g,1577998657.0,"I did armed security for apartments for a few years.  We handled all kinds of complaints as well as keeping an eye on the property, including mediating between residents.  I was called to an apartment to take a statement from someone accusing another resident of lease violations.  One of her main complaints was that this other resident's daughter was a floozy and was always, and I quote, ""sucking penis"" in the breezeways and the gym.  She described encountering this girl numerous times performing the act on what seemed like half the damn complex and she did so in great detail.  She used the phrase ""sucking penis"" at LEAST a few dozen times and it was everything I could do to wait till I got back to the car to laugh.  The other guy with me had to excuse himself because she just kept saying it.  I honestly don't know how SHE wasn't laughing."
