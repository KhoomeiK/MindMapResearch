leaks have the potential to carry misinformation, and many reviewers and review companies have rules against observing leaks in comparison to the final product. 

the only source needed to be reviewed of the product is the game itself. if you were to review a movie, you’d have to write for the audience of greatest ignorance; the people who haven’t read the book or seen the rest of the series. the same applies to video games."

asexuality,fcj0d5i,t1_fcgicjk,1577674144.0,"while Yaoi is fictitious, the attitudes of those who swoon over it bleed over into the real world. Yaoi as its categorical definition is just Japanese Romance Manga/Anime involving two men. There's nothing about age play (which, a twenty year gap with one party being fifteen is *not okay*) inherently involved. Unfortunately, due to the obvious young straight girls fetishizing gay men, Yaoi's now a loaded term. 

I agree with you that it's not all pornographic, and that this person is taking it too far. Just trying to correct the mindset of ""Well it's only fiction,"" because habits can break into reality and suddenly someone's not just shipping two animated characters, they're writing death game fanfics about their friends."
