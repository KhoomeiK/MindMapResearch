todayilearned,ffw0fus,t1_ffw0cvj,1580279254.0,That sounds silly.
todayilearned,ffw06yy,t1_ffvz6dv,1580278997.0,"I love it. Sometimes it feels like the worst job in the world. The hours suck, you get yelled at and called terrible things, you sometimes spend 12 hours at your desk with no food or opportunity to take a break to use the rest room. I have to make split second life or death decisions.
 But then you get to have a nice conversation with someone like you, over a small accident, and your world brightens. You get the pleasure of helping someone deliver a baby. You help someone with CPR and get the person breathing again. You help a mom with a choking child, and give them instructions to get the object out. There's nothing like hearing that child crying on its own again. Sometimes I get to be the person saving someone's life before the first responders do. Sometimes I get to talk a woman into leaving her abuser. Sometimes I get to talk someone out of taking their own life before I can get someone on scene to help. It makes every thing else worth it.
 I love helping people, on their worst day and their best. I don't think I could do anything else. This is the most meaningful job I have ever had, and I am passionate about it."
todayilearned,ffvyztx,t1_ffvxyy5,1580277767.0,"Oh man. Yes, first thought running through my mind is possible robbery or something terrible like that. What if dialling 911 and hanging up was the only thing that you could do before you got hurt? I'm glad the person called back."
todayilearned,ffvyub9,t1_ffvxy3m,1580277612.0,"Depends on who you get, I guess. Most of dispatchers are great people doing a stressful job, with long hours and few breaks.  Who knows what was happening in the center at the time ie; how many other 911 calls were ringing in, how much radio traffic was pouring in, etc. We are all human, and sometimes fail in our customer service when dealing with everything coming in. I'm not defending the operator, just giving some insight.

 If you ever have the chance to sit in with a 911 operator, do it. You'd be amazed what all happens behind the scenes. I'm sorry that operator was short with her. Accidents happen, and sometimes, everyone forgets that in the moment."
todayilearned,ffvxrfa,t1_ffvxpt7,1580276556.0,We also use on the weekend. Is there a different way to say it?
todayilearned,ffvxm9w,t1_ffvxc5d,1580276420.0," I've seen by accident and on accident used interchangeably, just didn't know one was more correct. They both sound fine to me."
todayilearned,ffvxdgb,t1_ffvw5pd,1580276192.0,"It is. But not every where in the U.S.

It drives me nuts too."
todayilearned,ffvvdc5,t1_ffvust7,1580274378.0,"Usually they call the non emergency line for the 911 center to give them the heads up that they will be testing the lines and how many calls they will need to place. Then they start the call with this is so&so with company and ask the questions they need answered. Then they hang up. It works well usually. 

The thing is, our police depts don't have all the time in the world to respond to accidental dials either. Each 911 center works with their police, fire and ems departments to work out what they do with 911 accidental, abandoned and hang up calls. For example:
From a hard line phone number that has an address associated with it, they respond to all 911 calls, even if no contact is made.
From a cell phone, they may never follow up past the dispatcher's original call back if no contact is made. Even if there is contact, if there is no exact location provided and the cell phone is no longer in service, its hard to follow up on."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffvuklw,t3_evgfop,1580273689.0,"Small pox blankets were a thing. But, we got chlamydia out of that deal as well. Humans do terrible things to each other. Karma usually pays us back."

But, today, you taught me something new. Thank you."
todayilearned,ffvtgok,t1_ffvswvj,1580272769.0,"What is your exact location? what is your name? what is your phone number? are you having an emergency? Are you being held against your will? Is there someone there that might be influencing your answers? If so, can you answer yes or no?"
todayilearned,ffvta6q,t1_ffvt2bd,1580272618.0,"I mean, also stay on the line if you need help. 

Did I use poor grammar? Is it supposed to be ""by accident"" instead of ""on accident""?"
todayilearned,ffvrvf9,t1_ffvpnyb,1580271493.0,"Oh yeah. That's an immediate reaction of a lot of people. I just try to educate people as much as I can when I see posts like this, to stay on the line and be cooperative. Less headaches for all involved. Accidents happen, everyone in public safety understands this. We would rather know for sure it was an accident, and not a call for help cut short due to xyz bad thing."
todayilearned,ffvrn5v,t1_ffvps2r,1580271316.0,"I mean absolutely they do call back. But, depending on how good the original call was, they may or may not have your location. Cell phones start with giving a tower location, then a better GPS location. This still can be off up to 50 to 2000 meters. If you are having an emergency, and hang up, you definitely want that dispatcher to know where you are. Plus, its not always feasible for someone who is in an emergency to pick the line back up when the dispatcher calls back."
todayilearned,ffvo1ko,t1_ffvjbul,1580268674.0,"Depends on the PSAP (public safety answering point) that your 911 call is received at, but generally, your call should be answered ""911 what (or where) is your emergency"" usually stated again if there is no answer, then something along the lines of ""if you're having an emergency and cannot speak, tap or press a button on your phone"" 

There are several phone system providers for 911 now, and a lot of them have a silent call feature that allows you to question a caller through button presses to get yes or no answers. Slowly, centers across the US are getting text to 911 functionality, so that tty and other services for the deaf and disabled dont have to be the only way for people who cannot speak can get help, no matter the circumstances.

Also, if you dial 911 on accident, please stay on the line. The person who answers will then be able to verify it was an accident instead of an emergency, and they will ask you all kind of questions, and they will be weird, but its their way of making sure you are not under duress and if you are, they can get help to you faster if you cooperate to the best of your ability."

So, do nothing, likely save lives as a whole. Yes, it will be a tragedy. But slightly better than letting that trolley keep going over one person, continuing on smooth track to rid it of the bits causing friction, and hitting the next."

MurderedByWords,fdcg7sw,t3_ekm1pl,1578274124.0,"Idk if I would take my husbands last name in my next marriage purely because it is such a bureaucratic pain in the butt to do. In the U.S, you have to go change your driver's license then your social security card.  Depending on state requirements for your driver's license, you need your marriage lic, 2 pieces of mail with your new name,  your birth certificate and social security card to get this done. Then, you have to make an appointment with the social security office and bring all of the above to change the social security card to the right name. To change your name back after you get divorced, you have to do it again but add your divorce decree for paperwork required. I fear that if I go to change my last name again, I will have to go through all of the above but add a new marriage license with all the other stuff I need. 

Plus calling all of the places you have utilities, insurance, bank accounts with, etc, to change your name is time consuming. It takes years to fully get your name changed on everything."
AskReddit,fcvfvzo,t1_fcv2dvm,1578001238.0,"I am so glad. That has not been my experience, but I am sure we are from different parts of the states or the world lol. I think part of the problem is I'm in a relatively poor city, and people didnt have medical insurance until it was required. Now they are finally getting their issues worked on that had been building for years."
AskReddit,fcv3au0,t1_fcv1wkd,1577993767.0,"Most of the time you have to continue seeing you primary care provider, plus what ever the specialist requires before you see them. If you miss an appointment or 2 with your pcp or what ever other person you have to go see, that specialist will cancel your appointment.  Ex: only pain management doctor in town/in 350 miles (thanks to the ban of opiates), requires 6 straight weeks of physical therapy before they will even consider seeing you plus a 1000 dollar nerve test that most insurance will not pay for. Appointments are at least 8 months out.
Diabetes is so prevalent in my area, that both of our endocrinologists are unable to see any other type of patient needing help with hormonal issues. They are simply just too overscheduled to deal with much else. Have a complicated thyriod issue? Hopefully you and your pcp can figure that out. If not, your choice is driving 350 miles away to speak with some else, or sit on the local endo's waiting list hoping someone cancels their appointment. 

As far as having to wait years, yeah, you could go somewhere else. You just have to take at least a day off, drive 350 miles to the next closest town, get to that specialists appointment. Then you have to do that every 6 weeks while they try different medications and treatments trying to treat your condition. This quickly becomes cost and time prohibitive.  Most people cant take 2 paid days off every 4-6 weeks at their job, for months on end, and still be employed. At least, not where I am from in the US. Alot of people just wait until there is a specialist in town that can see them."

aww,fc4o235,t3_eg5ts4,1577422468.0,"I am going to preface this story with this: I love ferrets. They are the most adorable furry tubes with so much personality. But as a child, I was terrified of them.

When I was 5, we got our first dog. He was such a good boy, and we stopped at the pet store to pick him up treats and food. This pet shop usually had kittens in a big cage in the middle of the store and you could put your fingers between the bars and pet them. I did this all the time, despite being told over and over by my mother not to do it. 

Well, one day, they had these really weird looking kittens. But, as 5 year olds are wont to do, I had to give them a little pet. I was sneaky about it at that point, as my mother told me to knock it off enough times. So I waited for my mom to go check out.

 I stuck my index finger in the cage and gave that sleeping animal aquick pet. That weird looking kitten didn't like having little fingers in it's cage, and it quickly bit my finger. It moved so fast that I didn't have time to react. I pulled my finger from the cage and what looked like the most blood I have ever seen was welling up on my little finger. I started crying and ran to my mom. She took care of me and washed it well. She didn't even give me an ""I told you so"", but I never stuck my finger in that cage again."
