Like they say, ""nothing is free"". We get more Love, Death and Robots at the cost of Mind Hunter (for now). I'm a big fan of both so I'll live.

In the build up to the Iraq war, we learned of the things I posted above plus, we were told that Iraq had WMD's. Let's not forget, we had just been bombed (2001) and we lost \~3,000 US citizens. We know more truth now but at that time, a vast majority of the US (myself included) agreed with the decision. I am not promoting Biden but this is at best, low hanging fruit for Sanders."
