Because not only have they now been betrayed by their church leaders, people they are supposed to morally and spiritually learn from, but they are now being shown that powerful strangers who could help, are willing to betray them too and help their abusers hide their crimes. It shows that they can’t count on anyone for help"

insanepeoplefacebook,fe6inv7,t1_fe3jrh2,1578892116.0,"I was the best man at a close friend of mines wedding. 

He himself has always been pretty religious, but very much a “live and let live” kind of religious and all and all a very genuine, decent dude. His fiancée and her family though? HARDCORE southern baptists. I grew up around some pretty strong Methodists, Protestants, and Catholics but when I’m telling you these people were one enigmatic leader away from being an armed death cult im not exaggerating. 

Literally one of her vows, and almost the entire sermon delivered by the pastor (who has known and basically groomed the bride since she was like 3-4) was in essence “you will (not you should) serve, obey, and submit to your husband like the church submits to Jesus Christ”. The running themes of the entire shabang was basically “you are his now, you better submit/respect/revere/worship/obey him at all times”. These are actual words either he, his gross little gremlin helpers, her father, or she herself said mid-ceremony. 

And the worst part of it all? 100% dry wedding, didn’t have a drop of alcohol that day."
