Is that study flawed? Yes. 

However, the point of things like this aren’t to belittle problems that women face, but to bring to light the fact that men have problems too. However, the “mainstream media” or whatever buzzword you want to insert there has a tendency to skip over those problems. This image is attempting to bring attention to those problems. 

Granted... it sucks at its job. The study doesn’t seems like it was conducted well, and the people on the r/MensRights subreddit can act just as bad as the people they so despise. 

In short, the image is attempting to convey a good idea, it just stumbles around and shoots itself in the foot when anyone wishes to know where those numbers came from.

Also OP, your name is either satirical or blasphemy, and I can’t tell which

Edit: yup it’s blasphemy"
