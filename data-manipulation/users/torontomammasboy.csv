However, ideally it should not be the absolute first thing you say about yourself.   It can be worked in with the safer sex conversation and sexual boundaries.    When telling, it should be matter of fact and not sound like an apology etc."

asktransgender,fd9zpko,t1_fd9fzt9,1578240003.0,"Physically speaking, if you were a friend of mine I would not mind you sharing your medical and physical issues.   I have no problem at all with anyone talking rather explitcitly about medical stuff as it is a way to make it normative.   But on this thread I find your comment out of place on 2 fronts (pun not intended).   It is absolutely horrifying for some FTMs to experience the monthly thing....top it off with complications...it can be soul shattering but not to everyone.   Your wife, not necessary every trans woman would like the option to feel whatever cis women feel.

But as OP said, it is absolutely non comparable and when we try to compare dysphoria in the moment that another trans person is expressing theirs we can get into trouble.   I believe it is usually with a close friend who means well but you can't.   We are talking about the most personal parts of our bodies.  

What I have found when I'm speaking to my trans friends regardless of where they are in transition or which way we are going it is best to stay silent when someone is sharing and we have a code and say something like ""i'm having body issues right now"".   Then we ask if we are in a space to hear more ""would you like to tell me more?""  sometimes we say yes and sometimes no and we just change the subject, leaves the person feeling cared for  but not invalidated."
