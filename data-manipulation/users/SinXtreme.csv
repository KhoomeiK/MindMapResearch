I stopped gaming about 6 months ago, due to time constraints, and was looking for a regular office keyboard and mouse. The MX Keys sparked my interest, because of its minimalistic design and then I saw an ad for the MX Ergo and thought ""Well, that looks weird."", but then I remembered my first PC and the trackball, that came with my copy of some version of Command & Conquer. Nostalgia kicked in and I bought it blind. 

I wonder how long I will need to get used to it. It's fun to use, but I'm really, really inaccurate right now. The ball feels kinda rough and scratchy, though I was able to mitigate this a bit by rubbing it on my forehead. (I thought you guys were just messing with newbies at first, but it really works!)

The thing is most iMacs have their major components, like the processor or the graphics card, soldered onto the motherboard. This means that upgrading them is pretty much impossible. In consequence no matter how much memory you throw in it, you're stuck with an underperforming system, due to a pretty weak quad-core processor and a negligible graphics card, all by today's standards of course. 

That's why the guy above me recommended to stop pouring money into this system and replace it entirely. 

So, of course you could simply buy a new iMac, MacPro or whatever else Apple is doing these days, but then you're up for an unpleasant Déjà Vu in a few years as they also are pretty limited in terms of upgrading. 

The alternative would be building your own PC for the same price. Not only would you get more bang for your buck or performance per currency unit, but you'd also benefit from being able to easily upgrade any components as they become outdated or to weak for the task and you have a lot more control over what goes into your system. 

If you've never built a PC from parts I would totally recommend r/buildapc, as well as a build guide from LinusTechTips or whatever isn't from TheVerge. [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) is a great starting point when it comes to selecting components and checking for compatibility.

I'm playing with the thought of animating it similar to a lung getting inflated and deflated by breathing.

I'm quite satisfied with the color scheme and materials of the tech part, but not quite sure about the organic one. I want it to look really unhealthy and uncanny, think alien smokers lung, but at the same time it needs to fit into the composition as well. 

I'm currently trying to get into creating detail with procedural textures, because it's a Blender contest and therefore I don't want to use Painter, which is my usual go to for fine surface detail.

I stopped gaming about 6 months ago, due to time constraints, and was looking for a regular office keyboard and mouse. The MX Keys sparked my interest, because of its minimalistic design and then I saw an ad for the MX Ergo and thought ""Well, that looks weird."", but then I remembered my first PC and the trackball, that came with my copy of some version of Command & Conquer. Nostalgia kicked in and I bought it blind. 

I wonder how long I will need to get used to it. It's fun to use, but I'm really, really inaccurate right now. The ball feels kinda rough and scratchy, though I was able to mitigate this a bit by rubbing it on my forehead. (I thought you guys were just messing with newbies at first, but it really works!)

The thing is most iMacs have their major components, like the processor or the graphics card, soldered onto the motherboard. This means that upgrading them is pretty much impossible. In consequence no matter how much memory you throw in it, you're stuck with an underperforming system, due to a pretty weak quad-core processor and a negligible graphics card, all by today's standards of course. 

That's why the guy above me recommended to stop pouring money into this system and replace it entirely. 

So, of course you could simply buy a new iMac, MacPro or whatever else Apple is doing these days, but then you're up for an unpleasant DÃ©jÃ  Vu in a few years as they also are pretty limited in terms of upgrading. 

The alternative would be building your own PC for the same price. Not only would you get more bang for your buck or performance per currency unit, but you'd also benefit from being able to easily upgrade any components as they become outdated or to weak for the task and you have a lot more control over what goes into your system. 

If you've never built a PC from parts I would totally recommend r/buildapc, as well as a build guide from LinusTechTips or whatever isn't from TheVerge.

I'm playing with the thought of animating it similar to a lung getting inflated and deflated by breathing.

I'm quite satisfied with the color scheme and materials of the tech part, but not quite sure about the organic one. I want it to look really unhealthy and uncanny, think alien smokers lung, but at the same time it needs to fit into the composition as well. 

I'm currently trying to get into creating detail with procedural textures, because it's a Blender contest and therefore I don't want to use Painter, which is my usual go to for fine surface detail.
