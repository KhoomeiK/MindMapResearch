Welp, they shouldn't have colonized half the earth, eradicated whole peoples and set up shop expecting for no one to say anything.

>ignore the fact that Arabic cultures were the first to begin the African slave trade

I agree with you on this point..

>the natives had little to offer to European settler

You think all the land, its minerals and resources were just all pristine without caretakers? The natives were in HARMONY with the land, they respected it and honored it..

What did the settler offer the natives? A means to their destruction and eradication of their ways of life.

They didn't *improve* the natives situation, however, the inverse IS true..

>They were still essentially in the stone age, aside from the Inca.

And if that worked for natives for millennia, who are the europeans to decide to force them to ""change"" anything?

Imagine Africans invading England, making everyone take African names, culture and dress, calling anyone who resists, ""savages"", killing entire towns of people, creating laws to justify their aggression and psychotic lust for control, forcing the peoples of england to submit to these rules, be enslaved or die.

England is about to go mental simply over ""immigrants"" coming there, as if there aren't british people all over the world and the ""crown"" didn't go around the world fucking up other ppl's countries to begin with.."

And if they were so smart, how did they need the natives help with anything?
