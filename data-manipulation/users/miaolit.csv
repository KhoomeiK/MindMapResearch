sex,ffj078s,t1_ffix6ng,1579987083.0,"I hope you realize it's not that simple; bisexual people get attracted to people of BOTH genders, but that doesn't mean they're attracted to everyone. She said she isn't lesbian, she isn't attracted to women, she's mostly had heterosexual encounters but she had lesbian sex and she likes it but she doesn't consider herself lesbian. 

There are other identities in the spectrum that is close to being bisexual such as being pansexual, gender fluid, etc. but my point is it doesn't matter what your orientation is, we put a huge emphasis on our ""gender identity"" or how we present ourselves.... but it's just a label that scientists need to identify our bodies' needs, medically or scientifically. I'm not going to expound because this is an entirely different topic, but I'm willing to discuss rather than throw a ""wtf"" and assume I know it all lol"

sex,ffienj3,t3_etsal8,1579972053.0,"THIS!!! People always think that same sex encounters are taboo — probably from internalised or societal homophobia — but it doesn’t define the whole of one’s sexuality! (Or identity / humanity / being, I can’t seem to get the words but I’ll try to explain) 

Let men enjoy eating ass or fuck ass or having their ass eaten or let them enjoy being pegged without the necessity to label it gay; let women eat pussy or let them kiss girls without having to entirely define them as gay — or better yet remove the negative connotation attached to the word gay? Because it’s less taboo than y’all think. 

Sex is fun, and to explore the wonders of each of our bodies can be different for one another. What works for you works for you — and if it feels good, do it!!! One doesn’t have to do what feels uncomfortable to them, one doesn’t even have to label the things they do in bed because we don’t owe anyone any explanation!

Glad you had awesome lesbian sex! Proud of you"

akalimains,ffbdbga,t1_ffb911q,1579760516.0,"In my opinion this happened to LeBlanc before when they lowered her Distortion speed and literally you can fuck her up with a Janna Q or etc, (they reverted her Afaik) this way with so many new champs and their new blasted kits that look extremely flashy, this « clunky » animation you say is something that crippled the champion just a little bit way too overboard........ Akali doesn’t deserve this"
