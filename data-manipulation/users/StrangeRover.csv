XTerra,ffjzp6r,t1_ffj952r,1580011405.0,"The original o-ring popped into the socket too easily, like the outer diameter was just a bit too small. Sure enough, it was. I could tell right away that the replacement was a better fit.

I don't think I removed the air box, but I can't remember because I've had it out so many other times. Either way, it's not much work to get it out or back in. Might be a good idea to give yourself more room to work since the AC repair is kind of critical and you don't want to pay for the evac/recharge to do it twice."
XTerra,ffj819z,t3_etxowd,1579992683.0,"Yep, it's every bit as easy as you'd think. I actually replaced the hose first, but I didn't like the look of the included o-ring when I installed it. Big surprise, it leaked, so I bought an o-ring set off the shelf at AutoZone and popped the new one in. 

Probably best to have the system evacuated and recharged after you open it up (I'm assuming it's already empty from leaking). Reddit will tell you to replace the desiccant pack too, but I never worry about that. The evacuation will pull most of the moisture out of the desiccant anyway."
Autos,ffim2xf,t1_ffhuu8i,1579977134.0,"I figured OP was referring to the CV axles, not the front-to-rear driveshaft because the manufacturer I work for refers to the former as ""driveshaft"" and the later as ""prop-shaft"", my mistake. I sometimes forget that this is not the common terminology.

Yes, wheel weights on the ""prop-shaft"" would cause an issue because it spins ~4x faster than the wheels. Weights on the CV axles would not have much effect at all, for the reason I already stated."
Autos,ffhbe1r,t1_ffglqvp,1579928760.0,There wouldn't be much effect. Too little polar moment of inertia that close to the axis of rotation.

todayilearned,fef50yl,t1_fedz3jt,1579048335.0,"Another factor is that ""frequent flyers"" know where to set their expectations. I take about 30~50 flights a year (which is not even *that* frequent compared to some), and it's no big deal (even at 6'2"") because I know what to expect. I'm comparing my current flight to my last flight, not to some romanticised image I got from a magazine ad for the airline.

Michigan allows heavy trucks to have more axles because it beats up the roads *less* by allowing one truck to carry the load of two trucks, but with lower per-axle loading than the two individual trucks AND a lower total weight than those two trucks combined.
