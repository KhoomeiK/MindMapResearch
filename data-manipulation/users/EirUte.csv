medicine,feicfif,t1_fehghn3,1579135249.0,"I’m not defending the “white accountability” aspect of this thread, just the concept of a wellness center. The email is obnoxious and I would have to be dragged to that workshop in a straight jacket and chains."
medicine,fei8vrv,t1_fei8eng,1579132888.0,"That’s what I thought too. I pretty deeply resented being told to spend my free time being told to stare at a peanut as part of a mindfulness exercise. Then we had a murder suicide, and the wellness center actually rallied for people who wanted them to. We had someone pretty badly assaulted at work and they offered all sorts of help I wouldn’t have thought available."
medicine,fei813f,t1_fehzv1j,1579132343.0,"Didn’t say it was. I was replying to the guy who just mentioned the wellness team. This sounds like a tangential project, but not representative of what I’ve seen wellness centers to represent."
medicine,feh1typ,t1_feg87f7,1579107383.0,"We can’t simultaneously rant about the increasing workplace depression/suicide and then snigger about attempts to help. From what I’ve seen, wellness centers in hospitals typically offer resources for people who have recently had deaths in the family, been assaulted, or had other major trauma. They also organize social events to bring residents together for social support, etc."
worldnews,fdubud1,t1_fdua731,1578730904.0,"Everyone on this planet has blame in countless negative events then, because its almost certain that we have all inadvertently contributed to the production of events we didn’t intend to produce. If the orange idiot is guilty of this, I’m probably also guilty of multiple crimes by your definition."
worldnews,fduag1g,t1_fdu8fxa,1578730366.0,No need for sarcasm. We can both have different ideas on culpability from intended versus unintended consequences without being condescending in how we voice them.

Cholesterol,fdsxn2u,t1_fdstg2o,1578709280.0,It’s a mutation in the LDLR gene. I doubt the test you did tested specifically for that unless you got whole genome sequenced.
YouShouldKnow,fdqnuuo,t1_fdqnd9x,1578671048.0,"The decision to treat is made based on the level of acetaminophen in your blood relative to the time of ingestion. Check out [this link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Rumack_Matthew_nomogram_with_treatment_%28study%29_line.pdf/page1-1200px-Rumack_Matthew_nomogram_with_treatment_%28study%29_line.pdf.jpg) . Yes, there’s a window for treatment. If you miss that window that doesn’t mean liver failure is inevitable, that depends on the dose taken and underlying liver function. You’re correct in saying that if massive liver damage happens, transplant is the only treatment.

Edit: I should also mention that if you treat within this window it doesn’t guarantee a good outcome."
Cholesterol,fdqnfo6,t1_fdpjl7c,1578670783.0,Take a look at my reply if you want to see the actual answer.
Cholesterol,fdqnehj,t1_fdpfay1,1578670763.0,"What ChasingGood is saying is absolute rubbish. Switching from levothyroxine to desiccated thyroid will not fix your LDL level. You very likely have FH, familial hypercholesterolemia, which can be diagnosed on clinical grounds because genetic testing is expensive. You should definitely go to that lipid clinic because certain treatments can dramatically decrease your risk of heart problems. The advice ChasingGood gave you is dangerously wrong. 
Your goal LDL would be in the region of 100. At best, addition of T3 would decrease your LDL by 13% but with no benefit on cardiac function. It is not currently recommended, and the treatment for FH is listed below. 
A very low fat diet is a component of treatment. Then usually a statin. Then maybe ezetimibe. Then maybe a PCSK9 inhibitor.

Edit: I’ve actually found some data that t3 was associated with increased cholesterol."
YouShouldKnow,fdqjgdw,t1_fdqj1dq,1578668159.0,"Yeah we could spend a long time discussing all possible outcomes, but most people I’ve treated walked out of the hospital with no long term damage. Which is why I kept it simple with “did just fine”."
YouShouldKnow,fdqijf5,t1_fdqeja4,1578667527.0,"I’ve treated dozens of acetaminophen or ibuprofen overdoses where the patient did just fine. There is a treatment. I don’t bring this up to lessen what you’ve said, just to let people reading this know that if they do find themselves in this position, the medical system can help. Sorry about your friends."

LifeProTips,fde1eaf,t1_fddnwct,1578328991.0,"It will still help a lot. A lot of the basic pharmacologic concepts have not changed at all. Most of the same meds are used. You might be missing a few meds, but it will still put you in a great position if you have 2006 knowledge."

medicine,fc29nrd,t1_fc296x9,1577347283.0,"Well yeah, but they swing in to the hyperglycemic range. I can think of one or two specific and rare circumstances where insulin resistance can relate to hypoglycemia, but this “diabetes/insulin resistance causes hypoglycemia” folklore has no place on a medicine subreddit."
medicine,fc28els,t1_fc283ur,1577345334.0,By what mechanism do you think insulin resistance would put someone at a higher risk for hypoglycemia?
