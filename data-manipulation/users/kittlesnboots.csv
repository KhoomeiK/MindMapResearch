Menieres,ffw5ma1,t3_evclfg,1580285416.0,"Yes, 3 times. Severe vertigo, severe non-stop vomiting.  It was when I first was diagnosed, before I had shunt surgery.  Very scary at first—and the copious sweating and diarrhea freaked me out (sorry TMI). I thought there was something that could be done to stop the vertigo, but there is no medicine that can truly do that.  Meclizine has never worked for me.  Zofran, phenergan, valium is the only thing that made things bearable to ride out the spells at home.  The sedating effects pretty much just let me sleep through most of the attacks, mine have always been around 24 hrs.  Then it would slowly wind down and I could actually start slowly moving again.  It would usually take 2-3 days before I felt normal.

It’s been 10 years since my first attack, 5 years since my surgery and I am significantly better.  In the last 3 years, my attacks have decreased to 2-3 per year and they are much, much milder and shorter in duration.  However about 2 years ago I had my first BPPV episode, and have had that 3 times, which were confirmed by my ENT.  I’m sensitive to certain head movements but I’d take BPPV over MD any day of the week!  It’s still vertigo, but the spinning stops after about 10-15 seconds if I keep my head very still.  If I lay down with my head on the left side and head tipped back slightly, that position pretty much always induces vertigo, but once I reposition myself it goes away.  I sleep with 3 pillows to keep my head more upright, and that helps."
nursing,ffagh7u,t1_ffa4nsp,1579735188.0,"I used to shit on Tylenol, until we started regularly giving it to all surgical pts, and it does help.  There is good research that rotating apap/nsaids is as effective as opioids for some types of moderate pain, especially in pediatric and geriatric populations.

My attitude towards it now is, if the pt can have it, they should take it in tandem with other pain meds, as appropriate.  Our anesthesia director wants all of our pts to receive it, ideally pre-op as part of the Mayo Protocol, and if they don’t get it then, we are supposed to give it in recovery.  We frequently give 15-30mg of toradol as well, along with the usual narcotics.  I do think it provides good pain relief, and allows us to reduce opioid usage."
nursing,ffaffev,t1_feks8n7,1579734477.0,"I get it, I’d be annoyed by that too.  We give Tylenol/Celebrex/Gabapentin to all surgical pts (as long as they can have each med).  Sometimes pre-op forgets to chart they gave a gram of Tylenol, so then I have to call to figure out if it was given. If not, then I have to give a dose in recovery.  That med combo is “the Mayo Protocol” and really helps with post op pain.  So I’m usually the one calling to ask, did they get any Tylenol yet?"
AskReddit,fevpfdr,t3_eqq6ld,1579399971.0,"My uncle (dad’s brother) and his wife.  Such an idiot, and unpleasant to be around. Examples: makes stupid joke, literally no one laughs, then repeats it again, as if we were too dumb to get it the first time.  Total f’n know it all regarding all subjects.  Ugh.  I feel bad saying that but he just makes it so hard to be around him.  He used to argue with my dad (who had dementia, and died from it) and would get him really riled up. Totally did not understand my dad’s brain couldn’t process stuff normally anymore, yet persisted in chastising him for his behavior.  He even tried to physically fight my dad in front of me once, until my other uncle broke it up.  Who fights a demented person?!?!  I’m still nice to him though, it’s not necessary to be cruel.  I just try to avoid him when possible.  I don’t think I’ve said more than 3 words to his WEIRD, WEIRD wife in 15 years. She’s 100 times worse."

Health,felgynk,t1_fekups3,1579221931.0,"I don’t think it is off, and I bet you have and just didn’t know it.  Anytime you hear someone died from “complications” (of whatever) in or out of the hospital, it’s usually infection, which means septic shock lead to respiratory and/or cardiac arrest.  Sepsis is a spectrum disease, it starts as a localized infection that became systemic (an old layman’s term is sometimes called blood poisoning) and usually kills people with compromised or altered immune systems first (children, elderly, chemo pts).  If caught early, before it progresses to severe sepsis or septic shock, many can recover.  However, the most vulnerable populations have comorbidities that complicate treatment, or they present to the hospital when the infection has progressed to the severe sepsis or septic shock stage.  That causes organs to shut down, and they will die without rapid and aggressive treatment. Treatment becomes more difficult at this stage.

Sources of infection are those areas that are permeable to the outside environment, I.e. the kidneys, lungs, digestive track, or a cut or break in tissue somewhere.  UTI, respiratory infections, GI infections, surgical, traumatic, chronic wounds, etc give organisms access to the vascular system, and then the bug can go wild, spreading infection everywhere.  If you have COPD, a respiratory infection is going to be more dangerous because of an already limited lung function, and people with COPD tend to have other chronic diseases, further reducing their “reserve”  or ability to fight infection.  Chemo pts are not supposed to eat in restaurants because the risk of food being contaminated with bacteria is higher than what you prepare at home—chemo kills the fast growing cells in the body, of which the lining of the GI tract is comprised.  So the barrier that protects healthy people is altered, allowing easier access to the bloodstream (not to mention their immune system is destroyed during active chemo).

Not just hospital pts die though, plenty of healthy people may have lots of reasons for avoiding treatment; fear of dr’s/hospitals, economic status, lack of access to transportation, lack of knowledge regarding illness, lack of social support, just to name a few.  They may not reach out for help until things become dire, or at all.

The type of organism(s) matters too, some are easier to treat than others.  Some treatments can actually cause organ damage too, making things more complicated.

This has gotten long, so I’ll just say, people are constantly dying of infections!"

nursing,fdm4bm3,t3_em22eu,1578539473.0,"Wow, that sucks! The ICU I worked in was incredible.  We had a small number of old meanies but I loved my coworkers, managers, charge nurses.  My preceptor was brilliant.  Fantastic residents & docs.  It was a great experience.  

I left for a combination of reasons; I was starting to feel isolated working nights in a city where I had no family and most of my friends were day shift.  I also was having a lot of difficulty with a chronic illness and had to choose to slow down to focus on healing my mind/body (which took a couple years).

I loved the ICU but probably won’t go back because I can’t work 12 hr shifts, I will get sick again.  Also, there were a LOT of very, very, very obese pts and I’m not willing to  literally break my back dealing with the constant turns, baths, repositioning anymore.  I really enjoyed everything for the most part though.  Except charting!!!"
nursing,fdm2orx,t1_fdj551b,1578538373.0,"Yeah but, what if you need to give Tylenol, but aren’t sure if you can, because: was it given and not charted, or not given? I’m not about giving my pts 2000mg of Tylenol in 2 hrs.  Meds gotta be charted, even Tylenol."

cats,fdhldae,t1_fdh529g,1578425105.0,"Good advice, I already have a bunch of MCFH episodes DVR’d.  I kind of forgot about them so I’ll do a rewatch.  I do think Fluffy hates that my fiancée is in “his” (the cat’s) spot on the bed.  It’s where kitty slept before the fiancée arrived.  I think my mattress (Fluffy’s territory) in the loft (Maizi’s territory, hence the sneak attack) is confusing for them.  Maizi is VERY territorial, with her spaces and her people.  They have, and still are, learning to share both.

I think maybe my fiancée should be the giver of food, and especially treats to Fluffy.  I probably should be the jail keeper with the gates at night, and the fiancée busts them out in the morning.  

We are working on more vertical spaces for the kitties so they can get away from each other, and also learn to trade who the alpha is.  They currently kind of rotate which spots are favored, and then who gets to sit/sleep there.  I think Fluffy, and his brother like the basement and gates at night because the feel extra safe, and most of my stuff  is down there. Fluffy knows his bedtime and “asks” to go down there because we do a routine of getting food, pets, and verbal cat affirmations (lol).

Thanks for taking time to respond!"

YouShouldKnow,fdhd2hb,t1_fdgos04,1578420206.0,"You’re correct that narcotics and NSAID’s can cause stomach irritation and N/V, especially on an empty stomach.

However, blood is VERY irritating to the body when it’s in places it’s not supposed to be.  If you start swallowing blood, there’s a high likelihood you are going to get nauseous and vomit.  Blood in the stomach from oro/nasopharyngeal surgery, or a bloody nose, or upper GI bleed is almost guaranteed to make you puke.

Free nursing advice: spit, don’t swallow, unless you want to experience vomiting blood clots.  Extra points for making your nurse vomit when ENT pulls a gigantic clot out of your nose/throat."

tifu,fdam0fj,t1_fd9plml,1578247526.0,"I’m a recovery room nurse and have probably recovered several thousand people from general anesthesia and deep sedation, in addition to having done hundreds of moderate sedations in the ED.  Saying or doing something “stupid” is one of the most common fears people have. I can assure you that the vast majority of people don’t say or do anything weird.  If people are talking when they wake up, it’s usually unintelligible or they are asking if surgery is over, or saying they are in pain, etc.  if someone is freaking out we have orders for versed and I’ll just re-sedate them a little and we can try waking up again—that usually works.  Most of the time people say funny stuff, if they talk at all.  Almost everyone is too sleepy to even speak, so don’t worry!"

Botchedsurgeries,fd3ldf1,t1_fd2m0i0,1578159420.0,"I think I just watched the Botched ep where Dr Nassif said if he had any more surgeries on his nose this would be the result. The dr’s were consulted because his previous 2 nose jobs ended with very bad asymmetric results that he was looking to fix.  In that episode Nassif wouldn’t do the surgery.  His nose has no cartilage left and is collapsing, there’s no way to fix it.  It’s just going to continue going downhill until it falls off, I guess."
AskReddit,fcjwadt,t1_fcjmn24,1577707822.0,Sounds like he was doing a stress test.  People do have heart attacks while doing them.  They are doing them precisely for the reason that they have already had some kind of cardiac abnormalities.  The ER is the 2nd best place to have a heart attack. The cardiac cath lab is the #1 best place.
