cookingforbeginners,ffharq4,t3_etdprh,1579928171.0,"Right off the bat, I'd disagree with browning butter for cooking eggs. Yes, browning butter makes terrific flavour, but that also means when your eggs go in, it's incredibly hot and you'd get charred buts even before some parts cook. 

However, eggs are a great way to start learning time and temperature control. Start with an objective/same egg (ie scrambled, sunnyside up, over easy, etc). And then try to replicate it. In my kitchen, it took me 30 eggs (10 tries) to replicate my chef's scrambled eggs, and roughly 60 tries to get the Japanese Tamagoyaki done right. If you're a perfectionist, eggs are a good way to begin, and once you get the gist of it, every other thing begins to look managable"

1. Get a chicken skeleton. Preferably leftover bones with some meat on it, should be cheap from your butcher. Get one roughly 300 to 500 grams.

2. Cut these vegetables up into bite sized chunks, celery, carrots, onions.

3. Into an oven tray, place vegetables and chicken. Coat salt and olive oil on vegetables and chicken. Place in oven for 15 minutes at 180 degrees celcius. 

4. After 15 minutes, add boiling water to tray. Return tray to oven for 20 minutes at 140 degrees. Water should cover vegetables completely. It's fine if they float a little.

5. Remove tray. The remaining liquid is your chicken stock. Feel free to use as noodle soup."
