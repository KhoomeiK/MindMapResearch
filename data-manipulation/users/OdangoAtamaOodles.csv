B12 is absorbed from animal products, and unless you're doing vegan keto, is most likely unnecessary.

With already having a history of ED, and the recent death of your uncle, I encourage you to do therapy/counseling, if possible, during your weight loss journey. 

Godspeed to you!"

""Two other major studies narrowed the prescription slightly, concluding that replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fats like vegetable oils or high-fiber carbohydrates is the best bet for reducing the risk of heart disease, but replacing saturated fat with highly processed carbohydrates could do the opposite.""


Pasta, in general, is highly processed carbohydrates. It has nearly the same amount of carbs (42 grams per 1 cup of cooked noodles) per serving as regular coca cola - 39 grams per 12 ounces. 

I love pasta, and I normally get the Barilla Protein Plus, which has chickpea flour mixed in to increase the protein, and decrease the carbs, in a serving, and I feed it to my family about 2 times a week. But call a spade a spade - pasta is cheap, but it isn't all that much healthier than two or three slices of white bread."

PCOS,fdj75fd,t3_ellr7n,1578460350.0,"Most people would benefit from increasing vegetation in their diets. I do like my steaks and hamburgers, also - but making the effort to increase vegetation while not increasing the carbs was the key helping my PCOS. Vegetarian/vegan diets can be fairly high in simple carbs - breads, pastas, lentils, etc. Sugar is vegan, after all. 

 Regardless of anything, the closer your food resembles its original state, usually the better, unless it's fermented, which does increase the good nutritional value. 

Tofu, being higher in plant estrogens, can help PCOS symptoms by as an exogenous form of estrogen, if you're not on birth control. Tofu is a great replacement for any animal protein, it just requires decent seasoning. (Note, tofu interferes with absorption of thyroid hormone, so those of us who have to take a thyroid hormone replacement shouldn't have soy products in a 2 hour period after taking the medicine.)

I changed out desserts and candies for fruit - frozen fruit with some okra thrown into a blender with a pinch of spices isn't all that bad. I also replaced grain-based foods with vegetables - instead of spaghetti, I'll do spiral zucchini. Eggplant is already a great lsubstitute for lasagna noodles. Instead of a hamburger bun, I'll use lettuce leaf. Instead of a side of rice, I'll do roasted cabbage or steamed green peas. I just replaced the grains because I love veggies and it was easier to replace something I like (ooooh, bread) with something I love, and would rather eat an entire head of cabbage instead of rice, anyway.

I... I have eaten an entire head of cabbage in a single sitting. In my defense, roasting causes water to evaporate, so it shrunk the cabbage!"

Too much thyroid hormone will metabolize the insulin faster, resulting in hyperglycemia; too little thyroid hormone means that insulin gets to hang around longer, doing it's own thing, and resulting in hypoglycemia."

It's called cabbage steaks. Thick slices of cabbage brushed with toasted sesame oil and roasted. It's not vegan if you top the cabbage steak with parmesian cheese and then broil for a few minutes, but I skip that part when I make cabbage steaks for my vegan and lactose-intolerent friends and family."
