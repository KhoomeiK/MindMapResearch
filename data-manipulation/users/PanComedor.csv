Mcat,fgdprmz,t3_dqdm5p,1580685191.0,"In addition, it's often depicted as if the prokaryote was 'consumed' in a single event, and lived and reproduced internally from there. But it's more likely that it happened very gradually, as evolution tends to be.

At first, the prokaryote would live in close proximity to what would eventually become its host, exchanging nutrients, like humans and dogs. Then over time, the two cells could have evolved a sticky surface point so they could stay close to each other at all times, like sharks and remora fish. Next, the surface of the future host could have evolved to be increasingly indented, protecting the smaller bacteria, like coral and algae. Finally, over generations, the indentation would have closed in on the bacteria, completing the endosymbiosis. 

This longer process would allow the two organisms to slowly evolve to adapt to each other's chemistry. The actual steps are only one possibility, but massive sudden changes are pretty rare. Usually there are many intermediate steps in evolution."

Human values of novelty and adventure are unlikely to be primary drivers of any space-faring ecosystem. 

A single self-replicating spaceship factory, something your unlimited-energy civilization could easily produce, could fill the entire galaxy in only a million year with dyson swarms. Once those are common enough, and free-floating asteroids become less available, you would probably start seeing 'carnivorous' space probes,  consuming the dyson swarm 'plankton', basically starting a space-based techno-evolution race.

unpopularopinion,fgc8v0l,t1_fgblvh6,1580670287.0," I definitely agree that the current system isn't very good either. I think individual freedom and human rights are, put together, fundamentally incompatible with the ability to freely procreate, since the free creation of a person does not require that the ability to protect their human rights is present.

Mandatory marriage is clearly a system for a different time, but I think it's an interesting sociological idea, so I'll side with 2000-year old goat farmers here. Just for the sake of discussion. I'm not *endorsing* the idea, just presenting it:

That's the core challenge tht traditional marriage tried to solve, in a world without DNA testing, contraception, or state-enforced child support. The idea (even though it doesn't always work as intended) is that before anyone can have sex, they *must* engage in the unbreakable contract of marriage, which is basically an agreement to raise any children that might be conceived, together, and to share all financial assets in the pursuit of doing so. It gets rid of custody battles, paternity issues, and financial differences. The downside, is that it also gets rid of individual freedom (to divorce or to have sex outside marriage)."
