Futurology,ffdu3l6,t1_ffbzcx8,1579828960.0,"You can be a conservative liberal. The American parties are named weird because Conservative and Liberal are not 'right' and 'left', they're 'right' and 'a general notion of the role of government in society'.

Liberalism can be divided into social (or civil) liberal and economic liberal, with both basically meaning little involvement by the government in your affairs. 

Social liberal is when someone believes people are free to make their own choices and the government (or any institution) is not allowed to impose rules on that (within reason, so no murdering or stealing or anything). 

Economic liberal is more aimed towards taxes usually, where someone believes the government has no right imposing taxes, tariffs and the like on someone's money. 

The two are neither mutually inclusive or exclusive. You can be both, neither or one and not the other.

In America, most right-wing people are also economic liberals. In Europe, most right-wing people are also social liberals. It's affected by where you live and what the baseline is.

When it comes to whether or not you're right or left, it depends on more general views. As a rule of thumb (politics are fluid) the right stands for order, structure, adherence to rules and the status quo. Conservative is a good name: they want to conserve what exists and will resist change as they see it as chaotic and a threat to stability. The right generally is also more concerned with themselves and their clique, feelings of being under attack by an outside group works as a social adhesive. The right is often seen as being more concerned with facts and statistics, even if it victimizes people.

The left stands for change, opposition to the status quo and often a resentment of those in power who they see as oppressive. Socialism is the name for this group because they advocate a more social approach to society; a joint effort where everyone pitches in for a greater goal. The left is often seen as being more emotionally driven, taking the wellbeing of 'others' into consideration and being more willing to shirk societal norms they see as being outdated or oppressive, even if it would disrupt society.

Both of these can be taken into extremes, although communism isn't really an extreme version of socialism since it's just an authoritarian system with some bronze paint on it. Anarchy would probably be the most extreme form of socialism. Fascism is generally the most extreme form of conservatism but there are other possible authoritarian systems too.

I wonder how this movie is going to ruin the plot of Matrix: Revolutions. Not that it was a very good plot but it was an appropriate end to the story. Neo was the One, ended the war, stopped the cycle and died.

videos,ff7i5cy,t1_ff6uuxg,1579650101.0,"Is life sacred? I mean, in the biological sense it is absolutely not. Every animal and plant wants to live, and all animals will need to kill/eat either other animals or plants to continue to live. Many plants are poisonous, killing those that seek to eat them to protect themselves too.

Maybe in the macro sense, it is. Life on our planet as a general concept is sacred. But I don't think we're ever talking about that. We can think it's sad that a young deer is killed and eaten by a pack of wolves, but don't the wolves deserve to live too? Is life sacred for the animals we own, but not the ones in nature? Or is it the other way around?

All life ends. Usually through violence, with humans being the exception for the last few millennia. And usually to end up as food for something else.

I'm not even commenting about the vegan vs. meat-eater debate. I just don't think the comment 'all life is sacred' should be responded to with 'sure', like it's a given. Sacredness is a human concept that we apply on things because we don't like the idea that they're just as meaningless, fleeting and devoid of purpose as anything else. 

Human life in human society is sacred, yes. But the catch-all 'life is sacred' is too vague to have any meaning, and I would argue too pointless to even entertain."

A) Nobody said to just let the murderers walk instead. There's a lot of room between freedom and execution.

B) Even one wrongful execution means that you could be next. Doing nothing wrong is clearly not enough of a shield to protect anyone from getting killed by the state. If you don't give a shit about other people, you should let that alone act as a reason not to want the death sentence. You're one bad day away from being on death row.

C) It's not one guy 70 years ago in another country. Especially since America has the most executions a year in the world.

You tick all the boxes:

> calling something, such as tests, racist because a **certain** population does worse than others, is just wrong

Subtle

> they aren't used in schools because they thought it was racist because a **certain** race was doing poorly.

Increasingly less subtle

> you can't say someone's race without being called racist, unless they're white

Strawman. Happens all the time. It's just that white racists take the public approach of whining about being called racist when they were being racist.

> Racism isn't a big deal nowadays. 

So... what's the point of your entire post if it's not a big deal? Or is it only a big deal when you're called out for being one, and not when you're actively being racist?

> The overreaction and wanted ""equality"", which will never happen, IS. We can never achieve equality. But we CAN achieve fairness

I'm guessing that fairness is that the other races stay under the boot of the white man and the white people get to be equal? Fuck you.

You're a *huge* racist. And I can say that because I'm a white male European which in your fucked up head means my opinion holds more weight than yours, you immigrant.

Can't help but link [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBc7qBS1Ujo) that goes into excruciating detail on why the assumption that 'certain' races do worse than others at IQ tests is a false conclusion drawn by a couple of white racists who wrote a book about it called The Bell Curve that anyone who isn't a racist shat all over for being racist and dumb."
