I haven't seen any theft proof holders, but I've never really considered it being an issue, and I've traveled with them all over. Over 10k miles and never had an problem. I've been stuck in rainstorms and haven't had any leaks from the anchor points either. 

The extra gas has saved me a few times. I doubt the sun makes any true difference, if you're iffy you can just empty the bottles into your tank every other fill up and get some fresh gas in there."

facepalm,ffn5spq,t1_ffmfqe3,1580062319.0,"Normally interior walls are framed with 2x4, but they're actually 3 and a half inches wide. Both sides are covered in drywall so you're adding half an inch each. So normally you're looking at 4 and a half inches.
