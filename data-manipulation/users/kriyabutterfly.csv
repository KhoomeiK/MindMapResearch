ettiquette,fgm6df6,t3_ezbif6,1580918805.0,"Hmmm.... I see where you’re coming from ... and clearly you’re right... I struggle with the same type of BS quite often... in my case it’s usually a line of rule-following moms who get to school early to pick up our kids.  We get there early to get our kids before things get chaotic & GTFO.  Every day entitled grandmas waltz up to the front of the line ten seconds before the bell & ignore everyone else... then they slow everyone down with their slow walking... same thing... (sorry for the tangent)...

This scenario is tough because the person knows what they’re doing and feels entitled to do it. You’re probably struggling with finding the graceful thing to say that won’t end up with her just whining and making a scene and telling you you’re being a jerk to her chiiiild.   The real question here is how much protest from her are you willing to tolerate? You could easily box her out when the bus comes, tell her “the line ends over there” or “we we’re here first so you’ll have to wait your turn”... or “ please show some respect for the people who have already been waiting and get to the back of the line”....or “lady, your cutting in kind is making us wait in the rain - cut it out”.... there’s a reason you haven’t done that… Is it that you think she will be smug and say something to embarrass you? You’re allowed to stand up for yourself, and this behavior is clearly wrong, and this has nothing to do with etiquette but it is quite likely that she is going to make a scene and try to make it uncomfortable for you to stand up for yourself… And that’s where you really have to ask yourself whether this is worth it. I’m not saying it’s not worth it… But this isn’t really an etiquette question, it’s more of a question of how much crap are you willing to put up with from someone who is clearly rude and entitled and doesn’t respect others.   It’s kind of relevant to know whether other bus riders are annoyed by her… You could wind up looking like a hero here… Or you could end up embarrassed if she tries to shame you for not giving her child privilege.  I guess you really just have to ask yourself if you care what other people think and how they react, But standing up to someone who is clearly being a douche is not rude"

He paid for the entire school to take a real-live Polar Express train ride at Christmas (an event with pricey tickets rich mommies claw for)... he routinely has helicopters drop gifts of - sports equipment to outfit entire teams to other school that aren’t even “his.”   Last week he revealed his next shoe design, and it has the I Promise school logo plastered all over it.

Frugal,fgifx05,t1_fghsyp2,1580820357.0,"I buy the bread flour at Costco or GFS, and order yeast by the pound on Amazon.  (Yeast is about $3 for two ounces at the store or $10 for a years supply - it last quite a long time ) It takes me about a minute to throw in the flour, yeast, salt & water for my quickie recipe.  It makes the house smell Amazing, and a loaf of bread costs pennies.  Homemade bread elevates BLTs into fine dining, and a load of still-hot bread is my go-to thank-you or hostess gift, which means I can give a gift that makes folks super happy for a few cents.      I make the basic bread quite often, but making hamburger buns, challah, pizza dough, focaccia, etc are all within super easy.
