The math here is a bit different though.  Assuming the numbers cited are correct, the CEO's salary represents more than $5,000 per employee per year.  That's not an insignificant number this time.

While a CEO doesn't do nothing for a company, and you can't take that entire salary away, IMO this is imbalanced.
