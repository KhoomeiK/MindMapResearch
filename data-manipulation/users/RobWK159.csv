AskReddit,fffxvak,t3_et8871,1579894182.0,"I think my favourite myth stems from one of the most famous.
Simply put; we are all children of Nod. And Cain is our father.
Nod is the land Cain was banished too after killing Abel.
Cain feared for his life but was reassured if Cain should be killed, he would be avenged sevenfold. This threat alone was heeded well by the other wanderers of Nod.
Nod is beyond the Lord's ethereal influence so it is said.
Once in Nod Cain settled, he created society, even a fortified city. He expanded. His armies of deceit and craftiness needed no spear as the ultimate weapons are avarice and betrayal amongst bloodlines.
Nod became the world as we all know it today. And god is now on the outside looking in. Its the reason why miracles dont occur and why we dont hear the word of god first hand. God is powerless in Cain's empire of vice.
