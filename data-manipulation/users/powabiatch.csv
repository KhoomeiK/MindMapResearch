explainlikeimfive,ffulh2w,t3_ev99yv,1580244463.0,"I have a different perspective. I think the popular conclusions of the study are garbage. There is no objective way for the study to take into account the quality of the homework, of the home environment, of people’s personalities etc. in a medical study you can reasonably control for many variables but even then it’s pretty touchy. In a subject like this, the fuzzinessof such subjective variables just amplify each other massively. I’m not saying the study itself is bad, but the conclusions are being improperly reported and believed."
