AskReddit,ffhk0mp,t3_etcyd6,1579938801.0,"Gun control.  Women attempt suicide more often than men, but men die of suicide more often than women, and a big part of it is method- men usually pick more invariably fatal methods, especially guns.  Most firearm deaths are suicides, and limiting gun access will move suicide attempts, especially male ones, away from firearms (which kill quickly and reliably) to more-survivable methods.

For a bit of historical context, the suicide rate went down considerably when electric ovens were invented.  Previously, a common suicide method was to put your head inside a gas oven and asphyxiate.  The invention of electric ovens made this no longer viable, and the rate of survived suicide attempts increased."

Definitely tone-deaf and over the top, but if you're already making 300k a year I think it's also kinda true.  Like, if you're making that much money already, what will the marginal gains of the extra 300k be?  I guess you could buy dumb rich person shit like a yacht?  Or you could put it towards early retirement, but if you're already making 300k / year that's probably already pretty settled.

I mean, the reason that 300k / year would be lifechanging for 99.99% of humanity is that it's an *absurd amount of money* that the vast majority of people don't have.  There's a point beyond which more money doesn't make you more happy, and that point is well before 300k / year."

There's lots of empirical evidence demonstrating that height is one of the strongest preferences women have for men. I have personally made fake dating profiles with the same pictures/bio, but different heights here in the Bay Area. The 5'6 profile did not get a single like in a week. The 6'4 profile had inbound interest from a wide variety of women, racking up more likes in an hour than my real profile gets in 2 weeks.

1. i'm amazed how quickly that thread went full incel
2. i'm sure this person's problem is height, not the fact that he a/b tests tinder profiles to prove ideological points"

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in MIT, and I've been involved in numerous secret websites in C, and I have over 300 confirmed articles. I am trained in assembly and I'm the top C programmer in the entire webdev community. You are nothing to me but just another 0.1xer. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am writing dozens of lines of C string parsing and using them to post articles I wrote so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your career. You're fucking hacked, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can write servers in over seven hundred ways, and that's just on the bare metal. Not only am I extensively trained in TTL logic, but I have access to the entire back catalog of Byte magazine and I will use it to its full extent to outperform your stateless webservices, you little shit.

fatlogic,fcrh1rt,t1_fcpx0of,1577901727.0,"There is actually a point there- some foods get coded healthy / unhealthy because of their association with the lower or upper class, as a sort of variety of the health halo.  Like the difference between (non-diet) soda and fruit juice / smoothies- fairly comparable calorically, but the latter get health halos.  Or a Snickers bar vs an energy bar.  Or sugar / HFCS vs honey / agave syrup.  There's a dimension where one of these things more costly / coded upper class and so viewed as healthier.

Of course this post is overstretching this argument, and not really substantiating it, but there is something there.
