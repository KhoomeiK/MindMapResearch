LifeProTips,fepo4m5,t1_fepeqiw,1579325790.0,"If you have the ability to not get into an accident they are not 100% at fault. It's your responsibility to try as hard as you can to not get into an accident. Just because someone cuts you off going slower doesn't mean you can just keep going and hit them and have them be at fault, you have to try to the best of your ability to not and then if you do they are at fault.


This is why brake checking works somewhat. Unless you have footage of them trying to make you hit them, you should have been able to stop.
