depression,ffaxzlk,t3_esdh0f,1579747098.0,"i accept you. even if you do shower with socks in the shower. :)


thank you for sharing this. really warms my heart to hear how that girl reacted with maturity.


i wish people would just ignore my scars and pretend they weren't there when they see them. any reaction, no matter if it's a caring or ostracizing one, makes me feel weird. the former of which makes me feel bad because the caring people are just, well caring people, but still the reaction makes me wanna die. tho lucky for me, most of my scars are concealed and i live in a cold area most months of the year so i wear long sleeves all the time.


last person i was intimate with was a fling or whatever so i saw her often. it made her a little uncomfortable (because she cared about me and didn't want me hurting myself) but never brought it up in a crude way. super sweet girl."
depression,ffawcps,t3_esgot1,1579746012.0,i don't do it as often but i do it when i'm feeling empty - just completely void of any emotion - and because i do actually like it. it's a good feeling (for me) but i know it's an unhealthy and dangerous way to cope. i guess also because it makes me feel in control.

depression,ff24h73,t3_eqs4h8,1579493557.0,"i don't think it really does get better, rather you just get better at managing it.


i feel like depression and my other mental health issues will always be with me, which i'm okay with since i know myself and (very fortunately) have people i can rely on."

NetflixSexEducation,fewn8sr,t1_fems6gq,1579415501.0,thanks for pointing that out. it didn't really feel like the weight of the matter hit her so i was wondering exactly why she's upset at that point. it makes a lot of sense now considering her attitude the entire episode. aimee lou was brilliant this episode.
marvelstudios,felv3va,t1_felt3qu,1579231685.0,"yeah, that."

depression,fehmez6,t3_eoxun3,1579119500.0,i'm goin thru something similar. like i wanna be happy and i definitely feel i'm reaching that point but i'm still withholding myself because depression has been my norm for a while now.

depression,fctpkst,t1_fcrl92c,1577953004.0,"> Is it justified for me to feel this way even though my life is actually alright?


It is, because it's how you feel; it's real to you. I'm still working on this myself but it's a daily struggle coming to grips with my own feelings (or more accurately lack thereof) because my life is pretty good.


Also, that's my biggest about telling people I'm in therapy, hahaha. I'm not ashamed to say I am, it's just that I know people are going to express their sympathy, which'll make me feel weird and gross, and like you said, I don't think people should feel that for me."
depression,fctp7ci,t3_eip1gj,1577952494.0,"eh, it's not really ""normal"" since it goes against our biological programming but i like to think - and my therapist tells me this too - that it's not that uncommon.


when i was really depressed, it was on my mind everyday. these days, i'm less depressed so it crosses my mind about once a week. usually when i'm alone and especially when i'm lonely."

depression,fctostv,t3_eiqkvo,1577951954.0,"ha, this was me when i finished high school. i realized almost no one has any direction in their lives; no one's life path is set in stone so everyone's just the accumulation of their decisions, most of which aren't inherently right/wrong."

depression,fcsvpax,t1_fcrjnsp,1577926309.0,"yeah, i'm in the same boat. it feels worse knowing that - mental illness aside - my life is pretty good. yet, i don't do anything which makes me feel like shit."
depression,fcsvfa5,t1_fcrvl2p,1577926103.0,"i'm only speaking for myself (since obviously everyone's struggle is different and any piece of advice isn't a one-size-fits-all) but i've found that helping others is the best way to help myself. anything i've done to help myself directly has, at best, been okay in making me ""better"". but helping others, when i wanted to and on my own terms, has been the best in improving my mental health.

haha, i generally don't do this often since i rarely get out and do anything but when i do, it's been a kinda treat for my soul."

TheMandalorianTV,fc6jmaa,t1_fc6izdj,1577482145.0,"yeah, i think it's a bit much to assume she's dead. like, gideon could've corned her and her clan, and she let the darksaber slip in the aftermath of trying to escape. that's just a dumb example, haha but just having the darksaber isn't much proof of her status."
