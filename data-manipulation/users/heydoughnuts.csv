poecilia,ffhanfb,t3_etm625,1579928060.0,Wow he is awesome!
houseplants,ffh9ud6,t1_ffh9425,1579927325.0,"I think it’s grown so much because of the aquarium water I water it with! It fertilizes it and really helps it grow! It’s also dechlorinated so that’s a plus too. Mine seems to grow in spurts, sometimes it seems like it’s not growing at all, then other time there’s a ton of new leaves! If you happen to have an aquarium, use that water. If not you could try giving it regular fertilizer!"
houseplants,ffgl53n,t1_ffgkppj,1579908757.0,It really is! It’s amazing what it does for the plants!
houseplants,ffgku5p,t1_ffgjciw,1579908549.0,"I've gotten a ton of plants from Safeway, and my town has a cute little succulent nursery that I've gotten a lot from as well. They also sell regular houseplants, just mostly have succulents. I've also bought three plants from Mountain Crest Gardens and they were great! The nearest Home Depot is 60 miles away so I have to rely on Safeway to get my babies! Do you buy local or just online?"
houseplants,ffgj72c,t1_ffghyxp,1579907467.0,"Awesome! That should really help it out, they love humidity!"
houseplants,ffgj54d,t1_ffgi4yz,1579907431.0,"There's a big, 160 gallon aquarium just a few feet away from it. The tank doesn't really have a cover on it so it makes the whole room pretty humid. That's how mine was for probably the first 6 months I had it, there wasn't any noticeable growth and it looked fine just didn't really do anything. I just kept watering and hoping then all the sudden it just started growing like crazy, I really don't know what happened because I didn't change anything. Hopefully the same will happen with yours and it will just explode in growth!"
houseplants,ffghnx3,t1_ffgh3el,1579906457.0,"Thank you, it's one of my favorites too! I had never seen one either and I actually got mine at Safeway. I saw it and didn't get it, then couldn't stop thinking about it and had to go back and get it! Glad yours is doing so well!"
Plant_Progress,ffgh7k2,t1_ffge2yw,1579906160.0,"Thank you! I'm glad yours are coming back, spider mites are a bitch!"
houseplants,ffgh2vr,t1_ffgdzvd,1579906077.0,"Thank you! The curling, browning tips could be because of a lack of humidity. Do you have a humidifier? That could help it out a lot!"
Plant_Progress,ffggxsl,t1_ffgdro2,1579905988.0,"It gets bright light from an eastern window, with a little light coming in from the south. What kind of light does yours get?"
houseplants,ffgfbis,t1_ffgdb59,1579904956.0,"That's good though! My house is covered in plants, yet I still want more even though I don't really have room for them lol. I want a neon pothos so bad, they are just gorgeous!"
houseplants,ffgf2fe,t1_ffgckl1,1579904798.0,"I've only potted it once when I first got it, it's going to need a new pot soon though! I also have mine in an eastern window, just a little less than two feet! Sorry about your Medallion, hopefully you can get it to make a comeback!"
houseplants,ffgeuqn,t1_ffgb9uk,1579904663.0,"Yeah it's definitely going to need a new pot soon! I have't repotted it since I got first got it, I used regular potting soil and a little bit of peat moss so I'll probably do that again once I find a good pot for it!"
houseplants,ffgaog2,t1_ffg9674,1579902085.0,"Oh man, I hate when plants aren’t doing well. I have an oxalis that was doing so awesome then I don’t know what happened and all the sudden it’s doing terrible. I hope your baby come back for ya!"

Plant_Progress,ffg43g3,t1_ffg3cp9,1579898030.0,"I use aquarium water to water it with, which kind of acts like a fertilizer. I don't use a humidifier, but the room that it's in has a huge aquarium in it and that helps keep it humid in there!"
houseplants,ffg3qd5,t1_ffg2kri,1579897801.0,"Thank you! Yeah I think a northwest window would be great! Bright, indirect light is perfect! I think the pot is a little over a foot tall. I'm not home right now so I can't measure it, but I'm pretty sure it's just over a foot. It's a pretty big pot! I hope yours grows awesome for ya and if there's anything else I can help with let me know!"

houseplants,fffy9gw,t1_fffvk52,1579894429.0,"Thank you! I water it about every 10 days for so and keep it in an eastern window. I don't spray it or have a humidifier, but there's a big aquarium in the room that I keep it in so that helps it get some humidity. I also use the aquarium water to water it with, it's dechlorinated and helps the plants grow!"
houseplants,fffxndi,t1_fffv2t7,1579894046.0,"I keep it in an eastern window that also gets a little light from the south, and I water it about every ten days or so. I always use aquarium water, so it doesn't have any chlorine in it and the fish waste helps fertilize it. There's a huge aquarium in the room that it's in and that adds humidity for it!"

succulents,ffe9s4b,t1_ffe8neu,1579840651.0,"Thank you! I water it about every week and a half or so. I’ve found that these guys can handle a bit more water than your typical succulent so I don’t wait for the soil to get bone dry, more like mostly dry!"

Aquariums,ffaxvoy,t1_ffax88p,1579747026.0,Ours love live baby brine shrimp! We try to give them bloodworms but they barely eat them. There’s tons of snails in the tank for them to eat as well.
plants,ffah8yu,t1_ffagckb,1579735692.0,"Thank you! I've had it for almost five years! I love that one so much, that and the Haworthia next to it were my first plants! It used to be so much more full and beautiful, it became root bound last year because I waited too long to repot it so I had to cut a ton of the tails off. It was a sad day, but it has bounced back and is doing great again!"

Aquariums,ff3kzde,t1_ff3kd9g,1579543275.0,Thanks! The blue lipstick boy is an Egyptian mouthbrooder. He’s starting to color up a little more since we separated him from the other male. Feisty little guys! We have some females as well and they ended up breeding. Watching the mama take care of the little babies was so freakin cool!

Aquariums,fep1fj9,t1_feozh2t,1579309993.0,"Some good beginner plants are stem plants like Bacopa or Water Sprite. Java Fern and any type of Anubias are good too. I also really like Cryptocoryne plants. Get yourself a good LED light and try them out! Amazon has a nice selection if you’re not sure where to look. Aquatic plants like fertilizer, I would suggest Easy Green. Your fish will love live plants and it would look awesome with your Spongebob theme!"
Aquariums,felt8hp,t1_felo7o6,1579230357.0,"Oh wow that is so cool! I bet that is just such an awesome feeling releasing them back in the wild! I would love to live somewhere where I could do that, I’m in Montana so I would need some pretty big tanks to help out since all we have are trout and such. Do you breed other kinds of fish as well?"
Aquariums,felnya0,t1_feldja7,1579226715.0,"They really are, one of my favorite fish. We have a huge male and he’s just awesome, I can’t wait for the babies to be full grown! That’s cool you breed them as well!"

Aquariums,felnkr0,t1_felecvu,1579226456.0,"That’s how we got our other rainbow babies, we moved the plants from their tank to an empty one! For these guys, we took the parents out. I was so excited to see these little guys, I just love rainbows!"
Aquariums,fekuhly,t1_fekt10p,1579207857.0,"Yeah rainbows take forever to grow! We bred our chequered rainbows about a year ago, they’re still not even near full size! I just can’t believe how tiny they are when they hatch, they are sooo small!"

Aquariums,feifp5k,t1_fehwb89,1579137447.0,"Thanks for the suggestion! We were going to do something like that when we first got it, but ended up just leaving it. Got the MTS bug and started messing with other tanks lol."

Aquariums,fehomwu,t1_fehnewo,1579120780.0,"We got it on Craigslist! It’s a Marineland, I’m pretty sure it was used as a lobster tank that you would see in grocery stores. It has a huge under gravel filter, we don’t use it though. We got it for only $100 with the big canister filter and everything, it was an awesome deal!"
Aquariums,feho6dr,t1_fehmmnw,1579120515.0,"Thank you! It’s a piece of screen door material that we put on there so the fish won’t jump out. The tank came with this bulky plastic thing that looked dumb, we had to use something so the screen is the best we could come up with! It also looks kinda dumb but at least the fish are safe!"

We’ve been keeping fish for nine years but got really into it, especially breeding, in the past couple years. We started off with just a 55 gallon then got an awesome deal on a 160 gallon and it just went downhill from there lol. My coworker owns a little fish shop in our town so we sell some to them and will hopefully be selling online sometime. Yeah dude the mouthbrooders are so cool, watching the mama take care of the babies was one of the neatest things I’ve ever seen!"
