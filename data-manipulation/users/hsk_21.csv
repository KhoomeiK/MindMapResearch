CharacterRant,fepqoro,t3_eqa3mo,1579328068.0,Not related to your question but will you consider someone evil who only kills while trying to preserve his own life? Like if it's comes to his own life he won't hesitate to use an innocent person's life as a leverage or sacrifice it. But he will only act if the other party are a threat no matter if their morality is better than him. Is he truly evil or not?

Why won't they take allmight to him? Deku's previous injuries? gone. Any future injuries? doesn't matter. The heroes just have to make sure they come out barely alive for overhaul to be there. This guy is a monster as a support , healer and on front lines."

BokuNoHeroAcademia,fd2cbbx,t3_ejtioi,1578145156.0,I have observed for a while that anime studios cut off materials from the manga for no apparent reason. Like studio bones cut off that Tartarus scene of all for one and the pussycats hugging each other or the last episode of nemoto's  bacstory. This is all the more frustrating knowing that season 3 had 3 fucking filler episodes. The same thing happened to the last episode of mob psycho and the entire season 2 of opm. Even ufotable did the same thing to very small scenes in demon Slayer. Like why the fuck do the do that? Do they thing they are better than the writer of the story? They should get a lot of shit for doing this on social media.

BokuNoHeroAcademia,fcmfyy8,t1_fcmez7b,1577773822.0,I'm not saying that he wasn't trying to kill him he just wanted to do a one hit ko as always. It was in the end where he used those attacks as a last resort which he actually got impaled by those attacks. Overhaul himself commented later on that he underestimated tenacious people like mirio. That trope you mentioned has always have people die when the other party takes the hit and is used in all forms of media not just shonnen. Mirio didn't predict the bullet being launched he saw Chrono pulling the trigger and ran towards her.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fcmek3o,t1_fcmd1w8,1577772394.0,Can you tell me which previous shows are you talking about where exact scenario occurs since you're calling it cliche. Mirio was just in time to get between him and eri. Overhaul could keep up with rappa because even though fast he was a straight forward fighter. While mirio's fighting style uses tactics or prediction. He also comments about it later on. Also overhaul would feel insulted to use a long range attack against someone quirkless and wanted to one hit ko him.

CharacterRant,fcjroev,t3_ehhzll,1577701246.0,"You have to realize even in the manga not even a year of school is completed. So a character changing his characteristics which he had for the last 15 years would not be natural. Bakugou has lived with an ideology of ""if you're not the best you don't matter"" for the rest of his life. Deku completely contradicts it and that's the reason he hated him. When people boosted his ego when he got a seemingly awesome quirk he started believing he was the absolute. But his ideology was constantly challenge when deku came to 'save' him. Also when he entered UA he was constantly being defeated both mentally and physically by deku and realised that there were people who were stronger (todoroki) and smarter(Momo) than him. What makes bakugou so intriguing is that he was the one who actually admitted it and to deku of all people. Also that he's an intellectual berserker. He actually thinks as much as he shouts. He acknowledged first time in his life that he was weak and promised he won't lose again. In the sports festival we realize that bakugou does not want the first place but wants an absolute victory otherwise it was meaningless and also doesn't underestimates anyone and respects strong opponent. He isn't complacent like endeavor at all. But yet again only gained a hollow victory which was the most insulting thing for him. When he was kidnapped and allmight was forced to retire he believed it was because of his weakness  that allmight the one who who was the incarnation who victory for him was for to retire. During his 2nd fight with deku we realize that this was constantly eating him and worried bakugou. The same bakugou who as only shown anger all this time was worried and felt ashamed of himself. Even when he won he asked deku why he lost since he had allmight's power but if he had lost he would have felt more ashamed on himself. This was the walking contradiction of bakugou's character as he told allmight that we was also a weakling like deku and turned him into that. After this fight we also see him in the longest amount of time talk calmly to deku and gave him advice about his fighting style. He looked at him as an equal and as a rival. Also his quirk isn't even a top tier but he made it like that. He used to constantly get in fights which developed his quirks from sparkles to what it is now which is why he has battle smarts. He also studies to be at the top of his class."
