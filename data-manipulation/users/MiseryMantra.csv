AskReddit,fgltowh,t1_fgl09h1,1580910686.0,"Haha i was sat next to a group of old women in a cafe once and one of them was telling a story and did that but about 50 times a minute. Seriously it was like ""eee so i says aye she says i know well i says what you need to do is go to the doctor i says and she says aye she says."" Wanted to pull my hair out."
books,fglthi9,t3_ez010b,1580910548.0,Not a single book but series of 4: last man alive in deep space.
carporn,fglt4na,t3_ez8pe1,1580910296.0,Think this is the first time I've ever seen a Supra without a spoiler lol
booksuggestions,fglgvxh,t3_ez4dda,1580897127.0,"The Dexter series. Book one is what the first tv series was based on but the rest of the books are completely separate from the TV show, so don't worry about it being the same if you've seen the program. The books are amazing."
suggestmeabook,fglgmgg,t3_ez5gky,1580896741.0,The Dexter books are fantastic. The first series is based around the first book but then they go off in completely different directions so the rest of the books have nothing to do with the tv series at all. I highly recommend them.
carporn,fglfxo0,t3_ez7320,1580895717.0,The clue's in the title mate.
forza,fgld993,t1_fgkd0n5,1580891830.0,"Even if he didn't mean it literally, saying ""nobody"" would only be acceptable if it was mostly dead and very few people play it, which is utter bollocks it's as popular as it ever was. Therefore the video is still total bullshit."
carporn,fgl9zbb,t3_ez29pb,1580887554.0,RS6. Always.
Unexpected,fgkcand,t3_eyuj4i,1580862238.0,That went exactly how I expected.
forza,fgk82uf,t1_fgk7ewb,1580859508.0,The title of the video literally says why NOBODY plays it anymore do you have a fucking disease?
