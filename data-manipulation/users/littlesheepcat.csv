A. You don’t really want to use your cards on minion that won’t do anything

B. If you want to use this to kill big minion, your combo spell with better cost less than 5 or Vengeance would be straight up better

C. Currently, there is more buff cards than direct damage

And all of this is because the card have STUN effect so I think removing STUN would actually buff this card to actually useful card (the flavor of beating someone while they are down is still there, just not as strong)"
