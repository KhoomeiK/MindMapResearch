VeganForCircleJerkers,ffwkhp7,t1_ffwjwp4,1580303894.0,"I didn't say she is abusive, or that is not a good reaction, but is how MOST humans react. If you express you are struggling with something and in exchange you get shaming and guilt instead of support to keep going in the right path, you are going to stop expressing, and potentially fall back. This is very well established specially with addictive behaviors, and food is addictive.  Stop treating individuals like they are not humans, like thy can't have struggles or normal flawed reactions nothing is black or white. That is not how human psyche works. Also she can't force him to be like she wants so she has to keep her expectations real, and her actions also have consequences on him."
VeganForCircleJerkers,ffwjth6,t1_ffwbk2f,1580303318.0,"Is not blaming, but it is a reaction.   
I had a dad that will beat me or my brother if we did something wrong. So every time I accidentally broke something I lied out of fear. I did wrong for lying but is a reaction. And him expressing his emotions about missing something to end up in a fight is something people will try to avoid, is emotional distress.  Humans are complex individuals and react to situations, it doesn't remove their responsibility, but we need to also understand what is happening."
VeganForCircleJerkers,ffwjiz6,t3_evgh0t,1580303058.0,"I just want to throw a thought here. Me and my bf are vegan, he for 3 years, me over 6. I still sometimes whine how I want a a cheesy pizza, because I do miss  actual cheese, and he agrees, we complain together and move on. we missing the flavour of cheeses doesn't mean we will go out buy a pizza or cheese, because our ethics are above it.   
But I need to be honest with myself, and I like to be honest with my loved one that sometimes is hard, I like to feel understand and supported also reminded why I rather miss it till my death than eat it.   
So maybe when someone whines, lets not invalidate that feeling, lets be understanding, lets listen and then remind that altho is hard we do it for the best reason, that is worth it.   


I am not saying in any way that excuses the lying, that is fucked up and breaks trust completely. But to built honesty we need to feel we are capable of expressing anything, does he feel so? I hope he really says ""that he doesn't care"" out of anger reaction to be shamed over his feelings, because you say he agrees with you on any other situation. Seems there is a lot to work on if you choose to, because is not healthy how is this going, you need trust. He being honest, make his mind and be consistent with it and you to make him feel free to express his struggle and support him through, I know is hard but we are still people.

  
My bf has a problem with weed cos is his coping with his depression, I know if I shame him and make him feel bad about it, he will just stop talking about his pain with me, he will hide and do it on my back and suffer in pain. It is not right, but is a human reaction. I know I have a limit of how much I will tolerate, and you should too, but I prefer to help him through it to grow together."

VeganBeauty,ffl3po1,t3_eu4se8,1580034246.0,"Hi, vegan from Germany here. I also have that issue I will tell you what works for me.    
Night:

If I remove makeup I use coconut oil for the eye area, and then a reusable cotton/bamboo pad with alcohol-free micellar water.   
Then I use a gentle gel wash ([This one from nonique](https://cdn-ec.niceshops.com/upload/image/product/large/default/nonique-moisturising-face-wash-100-ml-1173588-en.jpg)), your was should nor leave you feeling tight.    
I use an [alcohol free glycolic acid toner](https://images.ulta.com/is/image/Ulta/2551155?op_sharpen=1&resMode=bilin&qlt=85&wid=800&hei=800&fmt=jpg) to balance the pH of my skin.   
Then I use the [hyaluronic acid](https://s1.thcdn.com/productimg/960/960/11363395-1844508710845681.jpg), this has reaaaally make a difference in my life.   
Then I use a [vitamin C serum](https://media.douglas.de/sgf/de/015737/900_0/The_Ordinary-Vitamin_C-Ascorbyl_Tetraisopalmitate_Solution_20_in_Vitamin_F.jpg?imwidth=720) and Retinoids, this is not necessary and can irritate your skin if is sensitive.   
Then I use a THICK [night time cream](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gccvm88iL._SL1500_.jpg) and I double layer on my eye area.   
Lastly before sleep I put on castor oil as an eyelash serum, it spreads a bit on my eyelids over the night.  This has helped me also with dryness in my waterline.   
Day:   
I use a alcohol free hydrating toner to prep my skin. I haven't found the perfect one yet.  
Then again with the Hyaluronic acid, a vitamin C, and my [day moisturizer](https://media.douglas.de/sgf/de/908128/900_0/Daytox-Gesichtspflege-Daily_Hydration.jpg?imwidth=720).   
Then I use [THIS eye cream](https://cdn-ec.niceshops.com/upload/image/product/large/default/nonique-luxurious-eye-cream-15-ml-1173458-en.jpg). Is so far the one that doesn't burn and actually depuffs my eyes.  
Lastly a mineral sunscreen. That I have found sort of locks in the previous steps, when I don't use it I feel I need to reapply moisturizer during the day. 

So maybe be sure what you use is alcohol free, I do also recommend castor oil, helps with dryness and overtime gives you thick lashes, also that eye cream has eliminated the crustiness around my eyelids. But all skin care is a combo of all you do, that is why I put so much detail. Hope it helps."
