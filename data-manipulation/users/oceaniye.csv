PsychologicalTricks,fdzyd13,t3_en9mrh,1578798804.0,"Oh my god, are you me? 
Seriously, I think I wrote this 4 years ago. Shit.

Dude, I could t relate more. I went through this exactly about 4 years ago when I was in high school. I knew exactly how deep that darkness is and pitting that hole is in your chest and throat. I’m so sorry for your loss.

Losing someone for any reason will solicitor grief and that’s what you’re feeling. You might have been too dependent on him, which while this is something that is pretty and for your own strength and mental health, is something that’s natural when you are with someone that long, especially that young. 

I know it hurts, and it’s going to continue to hurt and break you and twist you and take the air out of your lungs, until it doesn’t. It took me over 8 months to smile for the first time. Even now, 4 years and another boyfriend later, I think about him and all the memories and it stings. It doesn’t ache like it once did but I do remember the pain of it all very well. Sometimes I even cry, and then feel guilty for it because I love my current boyfriend, but it is and was all very real and extremely painful. 

The only real thing you can do is ride the wave and find yourself in the process. Take up something new to discover more who yourself, explore other avenues of your personality that you don’t know well. I didn’t do this well. I cut all my hair off and watched every sci-fi show on Netflix twice. Take this as an opportunity to learn more about yourself and develop that aspects of yourself that might need some more development.

Most importantly, though, find a friend. Find a friend in yourself too, but really find a true and real friend because you will need it. You can’t go through life’s shit alone and you shouldn’t try. You deserve more than that. I hope you have someone that comes to mind who can help you through this time. 

I’m so sorry you’re experiencing this. Although I know nothing about your relationship or either of you, considering that you guys have broken up before, maybe going your separate ways was really for the best. 

This doesn’t mean you’ll be alone forever. This doesn’t mean love doesn’t exist or that love doesn’t exist for you. You’re not alone, even now when you are physically alone. So many people have been where you are and if no one else, I have. And I can tell you now, I have left that part of my life behind, I have moved passed it all.

One thing that has always gotten me through the deepest pain is my favorite saying, “this too shall pass”. Both the blissful moment will sometime end as struggle is an inevitable part of life, but the struggle will also end, and it will be met with bliss and comfort once again. 

You WILL be okay. I promise you. One day, not too far away, you will be okay. 

Find something to focus your efforts on to pass the time until you have found yourself again. It might take a while and it might feel like forever, but you will reach it one day. I promise you that you will. 

Please take care of yourself. You are the most important person in your life and that should never, ever, change."

I never said I felt that way about nurses, actually, I stated clearly that I did not. I was making comment about a sense of pressure I put and  feel upon myself, that does not equate to my feelings towards that population nor does it equate to feelings that I *currently* lack the discipline, but that I feel that I will feel that way in the future by not magically pushing myself harder now, even though I have pushed myself as far as I can go.

On a post as sensitive as I hope you realized this was, maybe reconsider your approach of tough love. Only a very small population of people respond well to that."

Obviously I don’t mean to generalize the entire population of people born in that generation but I am speaking specifically of the overly common stereotypical boomer. The one who is exceptionally outspoken about their beliefs with the intent to upset and discomfort those in opposition, the one who will walk all over people to get exactly what they want, especially when they are clearly hurting and bothering others. One who will say and do as they please and does not give a hot damn about who it hurts or inconveniences, someone who thinks mental health is weakness that you just need to think your self out of, someone who thinks any kind of help is a sign of weakness, someone who doesn’t understand sensitivity towards people and lifestyles we may not align with...etc. 

Maybe I am projecting all my unfortunate issues with my mom onto the “let’s hate on boomers” fad but as this started to become popular, I began to notice it more and more as a set of traits that came from somewhere in many individuals, rather than each individual just being their own kid of messed up."
