BokuNoHeroAcademia,fffz6ur,t1_fffvnec,1579895002.0,"Let’s establish a few things.

1. Deku would shatter all his bones in seconds of using 100%.
2. Eri at least can destroy a person in seconds
3. Eri used different strengths on Deku (see: the end of the fight)

Given that, you really think it’s reasonable that she used _exactly_ the right amount to heal him and nothing else? If healing him was 65% or her power, then 70% should de-age him by like a year every second. We know that she changed the amount of power, but you think that in her wild use of her power she, what, went from 63% to 63.001%? Real wild.

The power scaling in this show generally makes no sense, but Eri is the worst example yet and even the author has realized it. Why do you think she’s never used again?

They _kind of_ try to explain this by saying it’s a power-stocking quirk that cant be replicated, but this doesn’t explain so much.

For one, why use her to make anti-quirk bullets (that are less effective than real bullets lol) when she might just as easily make you immortality pills?

For another, how does the power stocking get reset with Overhaul “reset”?"

Tons of languages are mutually intelligible, for example. Even among mutually unintelligible languages, some are closer than others. Languages that start really similar can diverge greatly by what you call “mixing” — look at how Chinese and Japanese responded differently to the introduction of western loan words.

English is not unique in this sense, but among European languages it’s surely among the most divergent from its closest neighbors."

ProgrammerHumor,ff6dhta,t1_ff6c70l,1579624823.0,"It’s a keyword for [pattern matching](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html) which is a really powerful construct kind of like a souped-up switch/case. So you can do stuff like:

```

val result = (foo, bar) match {
  case (true, 1) => a()
  case (false, _) => b(“bar ignored”)
  case (true, x) if x > 5 => c()
  case (_, _) => some_default_function()
}
  

val baz_result = baz match {
  case x: ClassX => x.x_func()
  case y: ClassY if y.value > 0 => y.y_func()
  case _ => “unknown type”
}

```

Note that this works with different types like in the second example.

In functional programming a lot of functions return an `Option` (a monad, if you’re fancy) which works like this:
```
val m = Map(1 -> “a”)
m.get(1) //Option(Some(“a”))
m.get(2) //Option(None)
```

So the original pattern match I wrote is shorthand for something this:
```
re.find(x) match {
  case Some(g) => g.group(0)
  case _ => pass
}

```

The key idea is that your `find` function or whatever always returns _something_ and you use a pattern match to figure out if it’s a meaningful `Some` type or nothing at all.

The default is to pass if nothing matches.

I like this because it’s stateless, at the end of a python walrus operator’s control block you still don’t know if a variable has been assigned or not"

ProgrammerHumor,ff698zd,t1_ff68lfc,1579622113.0,"I guess I like pattern matching a lot more than this, e.g. Scala would do something like
