DebateAChristian,fczshaq,t1_fcxslfz,1578107852.0,"But if it were that obvious, would there still be a choice? I do not believe that a loving God could allow himself to be as apparent as water or air, while at the same time allowing his creation a choice in following him. If this is a God of self-proposed love, then there just isn’t any feasible way of the God both shouting out their existence, and allowing their followers to make a loving choice or relationship. Love is based on risk and choice, it is not the easy and obvious choice. And in a scenario where God does not proclaim His existence, this allows for risk and choice for both God and humanity"

todayilearned,fck47ne,t1_fcj7x2a,1577716101.0,"It is crazy isn’t it? But I do believe His claim for many reasons. I don’t believe so many people would have faced so much persecution, be beaten, and killed for it if they hadn’t seen Jesus after His death. Because interestingly enough, most historians don’t debate whether the tomb was found empty or not. They debate on whether some small sect of followers emptied the tomb or Christ was buried somewhere else. Had the tomb not been found empty it would have been impossible to even preach Jesus’s resurrection in Jerusalem, the Sanhedrin would have just hung His body outside the city due to impure nature of corpses. Not to mention the tomb was guarded by seasoned Roman soldiers by Pontius Pilate, and adorned with a Roman seal, stating it was a tomb under the protection of the Roman Empire. Yet there are no stories of a couple of crazed followers overthrowing these Roman guards and taking the body, just to start a religion that was heavily persecuted at its conception."
todayilearned,fcj3dzf,t1_fcj1m9h,1577676272.0,"That’s not how history works. He himself didn’t allow that option. He was either THE son of God, which is what he was tried and executed for by the Sanhedrin. Or he was a raving lunatic like what much of the Jewish and Roman world thought, hence the crucifixion. Anything between those options is pure speculation"
todayilearned,fc6k6qo,t1_fc4itd2,1577482525.0,"While Israel was occupied by the Romans, they for the most part followed their own practices of owning slaves. And no, every 7 years only the Hebrew slaves were freed, but every 7th of 7 years all slaves were freed in the year of Jubilee"
todayilearned,fc3qybd,t1_fc3pkvf,1577396397.0,"Well, I mean we could compare the amount of lines that discuss Job vs. the amount that describe Jesus. Mind you, Job only has 38 chapters and there’s a good bit that has dialogue between God and the Adversary. I might also add that we do have records of Christ that aren’t found in the Bible, such as with Josephus or the Roman scribe Tacitus, it’s very interesting to look into. Also, if you ask anybody who collects witness testimonies, they will always tell you that witness accounts on the same story are never the same. And if they are, the story is most likely fabricated. So the fact that there are discrepancies between the Gospel accounts has actually strengthened my faith in the past. And when it comes to the 10 commandments, those were to establish a covenantal relationship with the nation of Israel. Yes, of course they were still going to be broken, but the Old Testament was for the Jews and the New Testament was for both Jew and Gentile. And no, Christ did not come to “chide” us. He came to love, and to love us so much that He wanted to pay the price for what we couldn’t. People will always sin, and hurt themselves as well as others. I do it everyday, and I know I am not perfect. But I do hope this diminishes some of the anger that you may have toward the church, because believe me I was pretty angry before 2 years ago. But I’m glad we had this discussion and if you ever want to direct message me I would love to hear from you :) I’ll be praying for you and I’m thankful you allowed me this opportunity"
todayilearned,fc3pw72,t1_fc3npc3,1577395671.0,"Well, that would be because the Universe can’t be infinite. The way the universe is expanding and so cooling (in regards to the 3rd Law of Thermodynamics as previously stated) means there is a FINITE amount of energy and thus matter due to their relation to each other."
todayilearned,fc3ow9d,t1_fc3ne3a,1577394950.0,"Well for one, Christ wouldn’t have been able to afford slaves as a carpenter. But as to your point about Job, the 4 gospels are ALL about the life of Jesus. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are 4 different accounts of Jesus’s life. Not to mention some of the accounts of Jesus’s life in other books such as Acts. We know more about Christ than any other person in the Bible AND more than any other religious figure. And, let’s just agree for a moment, that God does exist to these people in this time period. Everyone else around them had slaves, and humans are not good at listening to this God. Slavery would have happened anyway because of the nature of these humans that can’t follow anything perfectly. Now what would have been better for the well-being of those who were going to be slaves anyways because of greedy people. To be a God and ban slavery, knowing full and well that the humans would not keep to it. Or to give rules that kept the well being of these slaves, and protect them from harm without interceding in the humans free will"
todayilearned,fc3nyy9,t1_fc3kav8,1577394280.0,"See, and I actually somewhat agree with you. It’s actually very interesting when it comes to the beginning of the universe because it could not have been an infinite past. Had it been, there would have been even less of a possibility of a God or some divine jump starter. But if we use some of the laws of physics that involve Newton Law’s and Thermodynamics, we see that there HAD to be a jump start that came outside of this Universe to set the Big Bang in motion. And I don’t think that people without God or any form or religion are keeping them from being good to each other, I just believe that there is an order to everything and I see so much beauty and freedom in realizing you need help. And that’s what my faith is for me, I cannot do everything by myself and I really believe that God has interceded in my life in weird ways that my rational mind cannot explain. I was a pretty antagonistic agnostic before 2017, and if you’d like to hear any you can always direct message me. I feel we may share more similar views"
todayilearned,fc3n4ex,t1_fc3jtxe,1577393675.0,"Jesus didn’t own slaves, I thought we were talking about the difference in time periods of slavery. Because slavery is very different from the Eastern World to the Western world. But why is it that you think the religion is Evil? I’d be very curious to hear, because this isn’t from our discussion.  This seems to be a preconceived notion of yours, but I would love to hear from you"
todayilearned,fc3m5pa,t1_fc3k96b,1577392990.0,"Well the  3rd Law of Thermodynamics for one, that in itself proves that the Universe had to have a beginning and could not have been infinite. And I’m not too familiar with scripture that tells you to hate anyone. What has happened is that that greedy and power hungry people have used the Bible to do terrible things, such as the crusades or what the conquistadors did to the natives. But these people are hypocrites. No one can love everyone completely, but what they did was disgusting when it comes to using the Bible for their own gain. And that’s not unique to Christianity"
