dogs,ffjo09m,t1_ffj5x5z,1580002680.0,Thank you for looking into this! Cats are great pets and could definitely fit your lifestyle. You also might enjoy a rabbit - they can be very snuggly pets - though you should not keep them in a tiny cage. /r/rabbits has lots of info about keeping a pet rabbit safe and healthy.
dogs,ffiepz9,t3_etr6nu,1579972099.0,"Blue started trick dog class today and it was super fun! It stretched his brain much more than the CGC prep class we are also in. They had us do some jumps to warm up and focus the dogs though which I didn’t love - he’s almost 10 months but still developing and growing. I was a little embarrassed as he was super exited to meet everyone - dogs, people, the shelving, the boxes?? in true pitbull style but he did calm down a lot after he got some energy out."
dogs,ffiec46,t1_ffdo6a4,1579971835.0,Thanks! We are in a novice trick dog class as of today so we will probably go for that next.
dogs,ffdnh7c,t1_ffde85t,1579824627.0,"Thanks, we will need it! :)"
dogs,ffd261g,t3_estlgm,1579811938.0,Blue went to the groomers for the first time and then we took a nice long walk to a big park this afternoon. He’s soooo tired from all of the excitement - he passed out next to his monkey. He’s taking the CGC test next weekend so we’ve been practicing everything but I’m a bit worried “teenage brain” is going to overpower “smart lil angel dog brain”.  We are also starting a trick training class this weekend which I’m excited about! I’m really curious what tricks we will focus on - hopefully fun ones and not shake/bow/stand as he already has those down. https://i.imgur.com/kRChzQK.jpg
dogs,ffacz5b,t1_ff9a3fg,1579732628.0,Ugh Blue also woke me up at 4:30 asking to go out to the bathroom :( what is it with today?
dogs,ff7ncm0,t3_erv5qp,1579653679.0,"Blue’s favorite toy is a smaller sized squeaky tennis ball from Bark Box or Pup Box - is there a way to get more or similar ones? He is destroying it but doesn’t love his slightly bigger and tougher squeaky balls quite as much. 




We went to the dog park yesterday and as we were arriving we watched his training class buddy drive away! So sad! Our new dog class compatriots are not so friendly - they have a purebred dog and I wonder if they are nervous around pitbulls. I notice people who adopt tend to be a bit less leery of them, but that may just be a coincidence.  Training wise, his leave it is basically rock solid but his pathetic look if he leaves something without a good reward slays me."
AskWomen,fevwf09,t3_eqp07s,1579402287.0,Hot coffee and fleece lined rubber boots to take the dog out. Also fleecy pajamas are really great and not expensive.
dogs,fel8uu0,t3_epowcu,1579216582.0,"Building on the KCC recommendation, an Italian greyhound also might be a good fit. They are very friendly and snuggly and would do well in the Florida climate. The weather up north is a bit intense for them! They are hard to housebreak but otherwise very trainable. The breed is also prone to some health issues (as all are) such as seizures, so I would check with the breeder about that as well. A chihuahua or chi mix could also be a good fit - chihuahuas can be great dogs but obviously need training and socialization. The Italian is a bit bigger than a chihuahua or Cavalier but still small."
vegan,fejk5bs,t1_fejd20e,1579177570.0,This is so interesting! I grew up with chickens and they lay so many eggs that we literally had to go door to door giving them to neighbors as we didn’t need like 30 eggs a week in any situation. Chicken birth control is a great idea for the chicken & to reduce the waste that comes from producing soooo many eggs.
vegan,fejjynm,t3_ep7453,1579177374.0,"I prefer soy but oat milk is cheaper so I’m buying that :) Cashew & almond milk tastes like water to me but lots of people like it. For creamers, almond milk/coconut milk blend is best IMO."
dogs,feid664,t3_ep2s7s,1579135744.0,"I got a big ball from Marshall’s for Blue to kick around in the yard and it seems to literally be his favorite thing in the world. He’s just started to become really interested in balls, and this is “super-ball” to him. A couple pits at the shelter I volunteer at LOVE big balls they can chase around so I thought he might too...and luckily was not wrong :)"
dogs,feicsna,t1_fehynb7,1579135491.0,Omg this thread is really summing up Blue’s attitude lately. He is both the best and brattiest he has ever been.
dogs,fegeyvh,t3_eot6nd,1579090464.0,"Freeze dried chicken or liver (I get the cat treat ones as they are lower cal), Zuke’s minis, kibble. Really high value is frozen banana pieces or freeze dried salmon. I tried making my own but they were terrible (dog liked but way too squishy!)."
dogs,fefdvey,t3_eolqbc,1579054219.0,Blue can see me through the window when I walk down my street after work. The remote tail wags...so cute! Also his upside down grin when sleeping kills me... he’s going through teenage naughty resurgence so I’ve got to focus on the positive. https://i.imgur.com/1LbdfZe.jpg
dogs,fec39u3,t3_eo3sk2,1578966017.0,It was $400 to adopt my dog and they have actually increased the cost since then. NE USA.
dogs,fe27i6b,t3_enfqk7,1578835300.0,"Blue - we debated naming him something “unique” but all the other pets have kitschy names and it seemed nice to bring home a “Fido” or a “Spot”. He’s named after the dog on Blue’s Clues as it was not breed specific and also a bit less 1950’s...we had also debated Lassie, Benji and Snoopy as well as Vampire Bill."
AskReddit,fdsyk3h,t3_emvsbl,1578709615.0,"I tell developers “It’s ok, I’ll take care of it,”."
dogs,fdsw05v,t3_emreuz,1578708662.0,"Blue is growing up! He’s started marking on walks...luckily not super often but it is noticeable. On that note....does anyone have tips for reinforcing not lunging or jumping up towards strangers? He doesn’t jump up on me so I haven’t been able to train that much at home. In really high stakes situations (small children, old people) where I can’t get away, high value treats get his attention, but usually I shorten the leash so there is no chance he could reach someone or cross the street. Ideally I’d like him to walk calmly by people - it’s starting to be an issue. A guy o didn’t see walked behind me as Blue was greeting someone who requested to say hi, and Blue jumped up at him. He’s cute but he’s also 50lbs now! So...any tips appreciated."
dogs,fdpb35g,t1_fdp7tfp,1578624204.0,You should soak a puppy’s kibble in water in general - this kind of soaked kibble or kibble topped with wet food or peanut butter freezes well.
dogs,fdpaxuk,t3_ema7uj,1578624105.0,"Following up on the whippet recommendations, Italian Greyhounds are also similar but a bit smaller. I think the breed may have some health issues you want to look out for, but overall they are a great apartment dog, friendly, trainable and very cute! They also need sweaters in cold weather but love to snuggle. A companion breed dog could also be a good fit - Yorkshire Terriers are really classic apartment dogs and are considered quite friendly.  Silky Terriers are slightly bigger, I believe, but similar in temperament and also theoretically hypoallergenic if that’s a concern."
Dogtraining,fdo0wu4,t1_fdkxvgk,1578596839.0,"Yes, but I would wait until the pup is at least a year to 18 months old as you've got two pretty big breeds. IMO the only reason to neuter earlier is for health reasons (ie - undescended testicle, etc.) or if you have a bitch and can't guarantee you'll keep her from getting pregnant :) 





idk what country you are in - in the US, there are some restrictions on where you can bring an unneutered dog (ie - not many dog parks, lots of daycare/boarding facilities won't take them) so it's worth neutering for that reason alone for many people."
dogs,fde0503,t3_ekum88,1578328158.0,"The winter is NOT agreeing with Blue's paws. Despite booties, he managed to lose one for part of our walk yesterday and during that time period, STILL got salt burns on one of his paws. I see people walking their dogs without booties all the time in our neighborhood....how is that possible? The walks are so critical for a well-behaved pup so I really need to get this sorted.





I also missed dog training class yesterday because the transmission on the car went out, so that's exciting. Hopefully it will be fixed by next weekend."
dogs,fddzti6,t1_fddwla0,1578327941.0,"Blue stopped wrapping his arms around mine when he developed the core muscles to ""sit pretty"" easily - she might not be strong enough yet and might need more practice with it. My hand cue for sit pretty is a ""goku punch"" which looks ridiculous and I regret it completely, but I can now ""goku punch"" from a distance and still get the appropriate trick.

edit: I see you said she can do it on her own - I would try having someone else ask her to do it. That helped break the habit of clinging physically as well as it was a little more generalized."
vegan,fdbo2gs,t1_fdb429w,1578259331.0,Sounds good! Thanks!
vegan,fdankxb,t1_fdajo1f,1578248049.0,"Exactly what I was looking for, thank you!"
dogs,fd61760,t3_ejyiyu,1578184107.0,"I usually wake him up for a potty break before I have to go to work...if I sleep in for some reason, he barks once and lets my brain do the subliminal messaging to wake up and let him out."
dogs,fd60mwm,t3_ejzsb7,1578183879.0,My parent’s dog has malamute in him- yours looks like theirs a lot!
dogs,fd60ayu,t3_ek0v2b,1578183761.0,/u/ardenboot showed dogbooties.com and I got some for my dog - they stay on for yard zoomies and long walks. The special Velcro works super well and the soft unstructured nature seems more comfortable for my dog.
dogs,fcz3fsr,t3_ejfvso,1578092880.0,I’ve been doing some free shaping with Blue and it’s going mostly ok. He is pathetically cute and I struggle to not coo and laugh when he stares waiting for a cue. We did target shaping where he needed to press his nose to a target for a duration of 3s but he got it only a few times before trying to eat the target....
dogs,fcwd4hj,t3_ej3be6,1578022641.0,"It’s great - my pup is pretty solid on all the commands in the house, so it provides an opportunity to practice with something really distracting (another puppy) as well as food & strangers. I take him to classes at Petco - he’s in the “Adult 3” I believe. Our trainer there is great and all our neighbors recommend him exclusively."
dogs,fcv34ss,t3_ej1ohn,1577993668.0,"Hmm....14 lbs is reasonable for a Shepherd Dog I think. Maybe Shepherd or Doberman? Both have the big upright ears and dark coloring. The coat looks a bit thin - maybe a single coat? So if she has Shepherd, maybe a mix with a single-coated breed like an APBT or Amstaff? That also might account for the shorter muzzle, though hers will grow ofc."
dogs,fcspv6l,t3_eiipem,1577922092.0,"Blue stayed up for the NYE festivities because his kennel is in our main area and he couldn’t settle - he went to sleep around 1 am with a normal bedtime of 9/9:30. Naturally, he’s a holy terror today. He woke up at 7 as usual and napped with me until ~11 but has been sassy and nippy which is really not usual. I’m hoping he will be back to his sweet self tomorrow. On the plus side, his paw has healed enough that he is no longer trying to lick it! He is getting limited walks in addition to his fetch exercise regimen."
dogs,fcnutxp,t3_ei44wu,1577818862.0,"I think a lot of this depends on how active you want to be with your dog, as well as how interactive with the Yorkie you are expecting your dog to be - I'd take each recommendation with a grain of ""how much do I want to walk/exercise my dog"" as well, as some breeds will have significantly higher exercise requirements. 


 

I agree with /u/Neener216 that a Portuguese Water Dog might be a good fit. I think there is a minor conflict between some of the traits you want - you'll see ""aloof with strangers, cuddly with family"" for a lot of livestock guardian breeds like German Shepherds, but not as much with terriers and other small dogs.



I'd recommend also a Border Terrier or a Silky Terrier - both are active but slightly less ""velcro"", making them a bit more reserved with strangers. They're small dogs with very different looks - a Border is a scruffy looking terrier, while a Silky looks a bit more like a Yorkie. 





If you are interested in a shelter dog, I'd recommend stopping by your local shelter as they often have dachshund and chihuahua mixes which are smaller dogs and often very cute and affectionate."
dogs,fclnyl4,t3_ehsbpo,1577752265.0,"I also grew up with GSDs so I do understand the draw - they are beautiful, smart dogs. But they have a very real prey drive. I would never have one with cats if they couldn’t be separated safely and potentially indefinitely. Not all dogs will enjoy dog parks and GSDs are among dogs who tend to be more suspicious/aloof so they may not - so your exercise regimen might need to be a bit more structured. I wouldn’t rule them out if you really love them and are willing to make changes to ensure the cats are safe and the dog is exercised and trained - I think getting a dog you are really passionate about has value for sure - but it also depends who is the primary caretaker."
dogs,fciell3,t3_eh6aoh,1577661381.0,"Went to my first dog show today and that was pretty fun! It’s a lot like horse shows so I’m excited to go to the next one. The crowd at this club were all very nice and funny. I was surprised at the number of senior (10+) dogs competing. There were no mutts however (though they were allowed). A lot of shelties ran the agility as well as two boxers, which was surprising!







Blue had his second advanced puppy class and his heel work is on point, but he’s still hard to get to focus at first. I did a 15 min fetch session and then some tug play as well as yard wandering/sniffing to help improve his focus but no cigar.  He’s literally glued to my gaze anywhere but class which is mildly frustrating."
