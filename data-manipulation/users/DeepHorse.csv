wildcats,ffga6qu,t3_etdvr0,1579901783.0,"Feel bad for him and was really excited to see him blossom. Seems like a really nice kid and thought for sure heíd be the hardest worker/toughest player on the team. I was talking to my dad like a week ago about who stays and goes after this season and I said I think Whitney transfers if he doesnít start playing well. Didnít think it would happen mid season. He really hasnít shown much skill or talent at all. I remember watching him against Arkansas when he got some good playing time and guards were just going right at him like he wasnít even there. Seriously looked worse than Sestina defensively. Not sure what happened. Cal needs to be careful when recruiting these ultra athletes that donít have much skill. Kinda worried about guys like Terrence Clarke/Camíron fletcher in this regard, though I havenít seen them play too much. BJ Boston will be fine because he is a really good dribbler."
CollegeBasketball,ffg2i6h,t1_fffktc2,1579897045.0,"I agree with you and I thought the same coming in. The difference really is that Hami could dribble and create for himself a little bit and got better thru the year. Whitney couldnít dribble *at all* and had bad decision making. In our offense his position doesnít handle the ball much, and since he couldnít take his man off the dribble he needed to be able to either shoot or fake and drive and he was terrible at both. Really meant he couldnít do anything on offense."

I think thatís much more fair. I rate our 3 guard lineup really high but I truly think they are the best trio in the country. Nick is also playing like a top 10 center so I think 84 is great for him. EJ is too inconsistent but has high potential. Nate is too bad on defense, Brooks has potential but still raw, Whitney just not doing much well right now but I guess high potential."

CollegeBasketball,fehkqdx,t1_feguw8g,1579118526.0,"Going off of OP‚Äôs rating of Hagans 87:

Hagans 87

Maxey 79

Quickley 78

Richards 84

EJ 74

Sestina 72

Brooks 72

Whitney 69

I think that‚Äôs much more fair. I rate our 3 guard lineup really high but I truly think they are the best trio in the country. Nick is also playing like a top 10 center so I think 84 is great for him. EJ is too inconsistent but has high potential. Nate is too bad on defense, Brooks has potential but still raw, Whitney just not doing much well right now but I guess high potential."
