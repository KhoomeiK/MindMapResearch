Imagine knowing its really, really bad. How would u send out a press release? ""Its not THAT contagious, relax"".

If It was nothing: they would say it was nothing.

If it is really bad: they wouldnt tell us

If they really dont know, they dont know."

iamatotalpieceofshit,ffg9mzg,t3_ete433,1579901444.0,shut down the airports at least for a week. Or is this the actual moment people are going to self destruct the whole planet due to stupidity. It was bound to happen.
selfimprovement,ffg36ig,t3_et8uht,1579897463.0,"what i do, is when i try to self-improve, is not look at the result too much. A kind of ""trust the process"" strategy. I'm currently trying to gain muscle fE and i might take a look once every two months. Cause its the process, the fact that u are just doing it, thats beneficial. The resultobsessed stance isnt that helpfull cause that will make u constantly aware of the distance between ur present and the desired state."

selfimprovement,ffe0b63,t3_esyh28,1579833398.0,"i think its because u where conditioned to think those things where childish, ....i see it with musicians all around me...""put that guitar down...u are 40 yrs old"" kind of stuff from their spouse....it might be an underlying subconscious thing where if it doesnt have either:

\-economic value

\-its ""working hard ""- aka for example going to the gym or running...

u know, the culture we live in, its useless and ur not spending ur time ""improving"", which u actually are, but not in the way its ""best spent"" . Most of the people i know are in this perpetual self improvement hell of going to the gym, looks, clothes, without realising they will all feel much better to do those things if they are doing creative stuff. Taking a moment to paint after all those years of brainwashing , a moment of actual peace? oh man...u gotta rewire your brain. Its so much fun to paint, the colors in itself will make u happy.

TLDR: self improvement can be done chill and relaxing"
AskMenOver30,ff92rc0,t3_es9pzu,1579703419.0,"My armchair philosphy take, I think life is terribly exhausting as it is. The highest commodities in this life are not what u can buy. How many times do u have to read last words like""i wish i ..."". People have been dying and being sick like a billion times before us and i'm starting to listen to them. Why is no one aware of the death clock. Am i the only one that is so aware of death constantly? I'm not lazy by the least, and constantly strive to be the best, but societies accepted goals are just plain idiotic. I'm chronically ill (i'm fine no pity asked) so i guess i have a different perspective.

I can experience more intense happiness by:drawing (pencil and paper) /   
  basketball (shoot at the local park) /    hiking /   just our local radio station with classics /  talk to a nice friend /  Play guitar / piano(a one time purchase for both, both the lowest quality for self-entertainment) / biking / building stuff around the house / learning how to cook / making my own horror masks / boxing bag (10 bucks on a garage sale) / painting a giant mural in my study room that should become a giant jurassic park like planet in space with glow in the dark paint for stars and meteores.

i think i spent my entire summer evenings when i got home three months straight drawing and shooting games in the park . 

Thats maybe ten bucks every each month besides the instruments i bought ten years ago. Most of these things are also good for u.   (just an example) Maybe u should try to build a life where u dont need all this stupid shit. U will literally be maggots, or burned alive ,possibly after a long horrible disease or a spectacularly disgusting squichy melonsplatter by a guy who texted ""No chinese food bitch"" before he mangled ur body with his Honda. I've seen to much of this gnarly stuff to not be totally stripped of any ""fuck"" i could give about 99% of the things ""most people"" **apparently** care about. I used to care about it too man but imagine u just got out of a burning building alive, and can that feeling for a lifetime.

take deep breath,and realise we are fucked beyond comprehension regarding the promotion of selfhate and -destruction that is the result of decades of brainwashing. The world is filled with stupid shit people collected over their lifetimes and some of them gave their literal life for it. Now its stinking on a pile of what used to be a nice piece of land. The titanic is always sinking in life, so enjoy some wine and listen to the violinist before u're the guy who hits his face on the railing falling down cause that stuff is coming and it coming fast.

when it comes to money, i save, save, save and try to build as much stuff myself as i can. It s hella fun. Go for experiences , good moments, simple happy days. U can always rent a cool car for a day when its sunny, then u dont have to worry about criminals or maintaining it, or a stupid scratch.

Be happy like Bob Ross. Thats my motto. He just needed happy little trees."

Just relax, you are way to young, being young is a precious gift that all of us older looking humans could only wish for :D. Its not easy out there so i hope u realise sooner or later that most things in life that u worry about as a kid are gone as an old (er) person. Most of the people u see around that arent nice to u will be gone.

My brother talks for five hours, and everything he says is gospel. His wife just stares into a void and fake smiles while he rants. My parents just smile in wonder, not realising about 50% (and thats being conservative) of what he says is absolutely false. He literally never can do anything wrong, and the rest of us are ""mere mortals"". If u would see it on camera, u would think someone was giving an actual lecture or Ted talk. That's how life was when I was young, that's how it is today. So we all just started saying no. Its that simple.
