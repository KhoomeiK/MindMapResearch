I'm basically just trying to live my best life and be happy, let things go that I can't control, and do the best I can with the time I have. I don't believe in anything supernatural. Thanks! I appreciate the info!"
childfree,ffx3w7w,t3_evkfrl,1580317202.0,Because they don't have anything interesting going on in their lives and they're narcissistic enough to believe that they're the only ones who know how to live.
TransDIY,ffx34az,t1_ffx2ww1,1580316731.0,Lol not really. I've read some of their stuff and I like some of it but I'm actually an atheist. I just like rhymes. I want to learn some more but I don't know where to start. What kind of stuff do you read/do?
TransDIY,ffx2kt1,t1_ffwwhwk,1580316397.0,It kind of sounds like if the world ends I'll have to become a crazy horse chick.
TransDIY,ffws951,t1_ffwnquk,1580309781.0,"That right there is SHTF scenario long term thinking. Having a horse = transportation, companionship, fuel source (burning dung), source of estrogen, and emergency food source. I should get a horse!"

todayilearned,fftcf0u,t1_fft8w2u,1580216312.0,"Secretly, I bet they enjoyed tracking this guy down. They get to prove that they're doing their jobs and get paid, and the guy they're tracking is a harmless old man who is just trying to feed himself and his dog. If the FBI is openly chasing him and fails to catch him, the FBI agents will still have their personal safety intact. If they try to openly chase mafia members they will have hitmen murdering their whole families."
todayilearned,fftc1lg,t1_ffsod5v,1580215963.0,"So basically he was a job creator and didn't even know it. Those FBI agents probably made way more money than him, too, with benefits."
skeptic,fftaa14,t1_ffsxmov,1580214206.0,"That's a vwry good point. Also, assuming that the ""staged and fake"" Sandy Hook shooting happrned in a real school, they must have gone to extraordinary lengths to covet their trail. There is overwhelming evidence of those kids going o that school, attending class daily, going to dance recitals, playing sports, going on trips, and it all ends that day. Assuming that none of those kids was actually killed, what happened to them? Did they all get shipped off to another school and none of them has come forward and said they miss their old school and their old friends? None of the parents who still live there can be seen to no longer have their kids? All it would take to prove that Sandy Hook was a hoax would be one Instagram picture of these ""child actors"" playing freeze tag when they're supposed to be dead and the whole thing would crumble. 

Two adults who are having an extramarital affair can barely hide it, and their jobs and families and marrriages depend on it. How much of a chance do a few hundred adults and kids have of lying to the whole world and not having one single screw up?"
