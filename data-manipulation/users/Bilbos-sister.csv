AskReddit,fcjn7a3,t3_ehg5ac,1577694842.0,This happened to my mom. She is a very kind person and is always helping people out. We lived in a small town surrounded by other small towns that were about 15-20 minutes drive apart. So one day she’s driving to the one town and sees a hitchhiker on the side of the road holding out some money to contribute to petrol. She feels bad and decides to pick him up. As she slows down and gets near to him she gets this really awful feeling and just punches the gas without stopping. When she looks in her rearview mirror she sees another guy coming out of hiding in the bushes
AmItheAsshole,fccw05z,t3_egzphy,1577603314.0,"Definitely NTA! This is so messed up. If they did this thinking it might help (which would make them some crazy people tbh) they wouldn’t be offended and upset that you are upset by it as they would realize that it is not making you feel better or anything. 
And also, WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?! Who does this??"

AskReddit,fc9fzq8,t3_egpeod,1577552123.0,Madrid. It is a lovely city with so much to do. I stayed in a hostel there that was so nice and included free walking tours through the city and free sangria hours in the evening. It’s so beautiful and the vibe there is so amazing
