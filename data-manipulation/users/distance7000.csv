Making rape jokes is *bad*.

Making gender stereotypes is *bad*.

Half the comments in this thread are like ""mhm, yep, amen brother women can say all men are the same and I get to keep makin' my rape jokes.""  Ffs reddit."
TrollYChromosome,fettgv7,t1_fets5fm,1579379877.0,"""Venting"" is healthy, but enabling the idea that ""all men are the same"" is not productive to changing the dialogue. 

People are taking OP's post the wrong way. The approach here needs to be ""speak up when someone makes a stereotype"", not ""stay quiet when someone makes a rape joke""."
TrollYChromosome,fetspty,t1_fetrp1n,1579379616.0,"So, now you're equating men to Nazis? Wow, what a real progressive you are /s. 

Feminism and Men's Lib are both about *equality* and fighting gender stereotypes. 

Saying ""men are slave owners and women are slaves"" is not a healthy way to achieve either of those goals. And if you've been beaten into thinking that way, I think you should try to reevaluate your world-view."
TrollYChromosome,fetlre9,t1_fethggg,1579376700.0,How about instead we call out both men and women on their shitty behavior? That way we attempt to fix the problem instead of perpetuating it.
funny,fep1ak7,t1_feouegr,1579309907.0,Yea Amazon has been allowing some real shady shit lately with Chinese knock-off sellers being able to attach their listing to a legitimate listing.
funny,fep11e7,t1_fenipps,1579309748.0,"Same price, get to walk home with it today, *and* no-hassle returns.

If I want to return to Amazon, I gotta fill out their form, print it, cut it, tape up the box, and find a return center. That shit sucks."

>Homeland Security secretary John Kelly said that people visiting the United States may be asked to give up passwords to their social media accounts. ""We want to get on their social media, with passwords: What do you do, what do you say?"" Kelly told the House Homeland Security Committee.
