AmItheAsshole,ffc69in,t3_esqoi4,1579792512.0,Depends....are you and your wife going the extra miles to keep them connected to their cultures? Great you adopted 3 kids.
AmItheAsshole,ffbbulq,t3_esjhx2,1579758921.0,Yta and so is your brother. She is here now so include her. If someone new is there next year include him/her. Anything else is just strange.

unpopularopinion,ff65y4u,t3_eroexl,1579619928.0,"OP unless you deal with racism on a daily basis you have no leg to stand on saying it's not a big deal nowadays.  I'm guessing you aren't a person of color so you don't have to have certain talks with your kids to make sure they come home alive, but because of something they have done, but because of the color of their skin. Boomer or not...actually as a boomer you should understand more because you have seen more."

AmItheAsshole,feybh8g,t3_eqtevd,1579443269.0,"Nta I understand she was young and you both were raised in a religious household....I get it...However, her actions led to life consequences for you...it should have been your decision to tell your parents when and if you were ready. You lost so much from that action that will ultimately affect the rest of your life...you do what you need to live in peace now. You don't owe her anything because she was a child at the time...actions have consequences whether we realize the extent of those consequences at the time or not. One thing that is great is that you have the ability to build the family the family you want. My heart is with you and I'm glad to see you are doing better now. You deserve it."

unpopularopinion,fdhco7x,t1_fdh9ozu,1578420007.0,I didn't mean your life doesn't stop...I meant the parents. Calling names is unnecessary and rude. Don't be a keyboard warrior because we don't agree. You have your opinion I have mine. The discussion ends when the name calling begins. Bye
