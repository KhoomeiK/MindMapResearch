me_irl,ffkz2uj,t1_ffkxbpv,1580031726.0,"Imperialism is a uniquely capitalist invention. It literally requires the acquisition of foreign territories so the resource wealth can be extracted to profit the homeland. Communist countries have never done that. Like them or not (btw I'm in the ""not"" camp because authoritarianism is bullshit) when your country joined the USSR it tended to be more beneficial to you than being colonized by an imperialist power was. No it wasn't ideal. The USSR was a totalitarian nightmare for much of its early history, especially under Stalin. But in 1950, if you lived in the Soviet Union, you had somewhere to live and (despite the stereotype) you had as much food as any other working class European. Often Soviet citizens were eating *better* than Europeans or Americans. Does this justify secret police and target famines? Jesus fucking Christ no. REGULAR cops are bad enough so secret ones can fuck RIGHT off. And in my opinion the Holodomor is as much of a genocide as the Irish Potato Famine.

But after Stalin was dead and buried, life was at *least* ""fine"" for basically everyone. In a nation that had basically been medieval dirt farmers fifty years beforehand. Say what you will about them, but the Soviets never went to foreign countries and forced the local citizens to extract all their mineral wealth and fork it over for pennies on the dollar."

Capitalism has no answer to that. Like you said, if they did, that labor would be making a living wage. But they aren't. So we have to step in and ensure that workers can survive on the proceeds of their labor.

Yes. Absolutely. I want that. They've shown that the only thing they do if we let the accumulate wealth is use it to enrich themselves and tear down safeguards against their power. Forcing them to distribute more of the profits to the actual workers will achieve greater success for everyone as a whole, at the loss of DIZZYING success for only a few. 

>living beyond what most people can imagine. 

Yeah. That's BAD. We shouldn't be living lives of luxury if it requires suffering in such a massive scale. And make no mistake, that's WHY it's happening. Developing nations are great because they provide cheap disposable labor and natural resources that companies bought from the colonial powers who stole the land in the first place. These companies extract all the mineral wealth for pennies on the dollar because there are no regulations on labor in many of these places. Americans are doing this around the world. We could make it illegal, but we don't. Because capitalism doesn't care about anything but maximizing profits and minimizing how much of that profit you pay out to workers and vendors. 

>nothing stops you from starting a business and walking your talk. 

How about the fact that I, like most Americans, have basically no money? I live paycheck to paycheck. Most people do in America. Poor people can't just ""start a business"" and acting like that's an actual ladder out of poverty is just so fucking condescending and shows such ignorance of the realities of poverty. 

This economy has done more for ITS version of prosperity. Which is, to say, it's been really profitable. But it hasn't made life better for average people. It's provided convenience and technology, but it's also stripped away basic labor rights that kept people from being underpaid and exploited. It's destroyed the environment, possibly forever. 

Also ""fuck capitalism, burn it to the ground""? Not super easy to make into a business. Our ideas don't all fit in a ballot box or a bank account.

>it won't provide you or others with a living wage for work that is not worth the wage. If it was, you would he earning the wage already 

So you admit there are jobs that need doing, take forty hours a week to do, but you don't think the human beings doing those jobs should be paid a living wage? Okay, cool.

Capitalism has no answer to that. Like you said, if they did, that labor would be making a living wage. But they aren't. So we have to step in and ensure that workers can survive on the proceeds of their labor.

Yeah you're right I hate having breathable air and food that doesn't kill me and medicine that contains what it says it does government regulation is evil and gets in the way of freedom 

>You want government to judge where investors can put their money and what profits they can make 

Yes. Absolutely. I want that. They've shown that the only thing they do if we let the accumulate wealth is use it to enrich themselves and tear down safeguards against their power. Forcing them to distribute more of the profits to the actual workers will achieve greater success for everyone as a whole, at the loss of DIZZYING success for only a few. 

>living beyond what most people can imagine. 

Yeah. That's BAD. We shouldn't be living lives of luxury if it requires suffering in such a massive scale. And make no mistake, that's WHY it's happening. Developing nations are great because they provide cheap disposable labor and natural resources that companies bought from the colonial powers who stole the land in the first place. These companies extract all the mineral wealth for pennies on the dollar because there are no regulations on labor in many of these places. Americans are doing this around the world. We could make it illegal, but we don't. Because capitalism doesn't care about anything but maximizing profits and minimizing how much of that profit you pay out to workers and vendors. 

>nothing stops you from starting a business and walking your talk. 

How about the fact that I, like most Americans, have basically no money? I live paycheck to paycheck. Most people do in America. Poor people can't just ""start a business"" and acting like that's an actual ladder out of poverty is just so fucking condescending and shows such ignorance of the realities of poverty. 

This economy has done more for ITS version of prosperity. Which is, to say, it's been really profitable. But it hasn't made life better for average people. It's provided convenience and technology, but it's also stripped away basic labor rights that kept people from being underpaid and exploited. It's destroyed the environment, possibly forever. 

Also ""fuck capitalism, burn it to the ground""? Not super easy to make into a business. Our ideas don't all fit in a ballot box or a bank account.

>it won't provide you or others with a living wage for work that is not worth the wage. If it was, you would he earning the wage already 

So you admit there are jobs that need doing, take forty hours a week to do, but you don't think the human beings doing those jobs should be paid a living wage? Okay, cool.
