WTF,ffleewz,t1_ffl7mes,1580038552.0,"It is so hard to watch someone you love and respect erode away. The cruelest thing about dementia would be those moments of clarity when they are back, for a short moment, then they are gone again. I can fully sympathize, and I'm sorry you know the pain too."
WTF,ffl0byy,t1_ffkyjug,1580032445.0,"Yep, sun downing, when they are disoriented and confused, even frightened at night. If you live with an elderly family member with dementia, you get the confused exploration, or blood curdling panic screaming at night. Some people are worse than others..."

BrandNewSentence,ffjfpyn,t3_etx817,1579997289.0,"She seems ashamed in her mug shot, so maybe there is enough self awareness to know it is wrong. 

So, what...WHAT, motivates a person to shit in a highly public space where you probably can't wipe and wash your hands, and you risk getting arrested? Is it a morbid thrill she gets? 

She does not look meth addled, and seems to register shame and humiliation like a neurotypical person would (but you never know how deep the rabbit hole can go just by looking at a pic obviously)

It is more trouble than it is worth, shitting in public"
Showerthoughts,ffjetze,t3_etxjtu,1579996761.0,"This is mostly a North American thing. In some countries it is not a big deal if one's tits are out to feed a baby, or even if you just want to air things out. Communal bathing is not that unusual. There are billboards in places that show nudity too."
