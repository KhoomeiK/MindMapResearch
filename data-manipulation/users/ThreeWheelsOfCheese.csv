cactus,ffm4cd4,t1_ffl2krs,1580048250.0,"I’m actually so surprised that this thing can tolerate pretty cold temps. Ha, yeah, I didn’t think it looked like the spines were a big deal and touched it with my bare hand very gently to steady it while potting. Ow."
cactus,ffk24g6,t1_ffk1t6g,1580013467.0,Thanks so much for the advice! I’m a total beginner at cacti (this is literally my first) - I will have to do some more reading about this guy and change up his habitat. Unfortunately I’m nowhere near Arizona - I hope a grow light is sufficient for the winter until it’s warm/sunny enough to move outside.
bulletjournal,ffk1k2q,t1_ffj8y22,1580012985.0,How cool! I can see why you’re obsessed!
cactus,ffk1a1l,t3_etoaot,1580012743.0,These are so gorgeous. Do you know the species name for the pretty red and green patterned ones?
cactus,ffk12zp,t1_ffjwyqu,1580012574.0,"I’m not OP, but thank you for sharing this. I just had a piece of my cactus fall off too, and was panicking a little. Hope I can get it to root!"
cactus,ffk0j48,t3_eu1y96,1580012099.0,"When I saw it my first thought was “Is that just a bunch of pine cones in a flower pot?” Had to Google what it was and then decided I just had to have it. 

Have any of you ever had one of these?"
bulletjournal,ffizy9t,t3_et890m,1579986900.0,I love that you mixed in some animals that are a bit uncommon. I have a soft spot for bats and your bat guy is so cute!
bulletjournal,ffizmar,t3_etghra,1579986659.0,Wow I absolutely love this! Where do you find cool things like vintage movie tickets?
bulletjournal,ffizgtr,t3_etsrf0,1579986548.0,"Bill tracker, monthly budgets, tracker for how often I bring my lunch to work, books I’ve read, etc. I think I’ll be adding pages as needed each month. Not quite sure yet. I keep my work stuff within my work email calendar and have a separate to-dos notebook just for work."
bulletjournal,fff4si0,t1_ffeagn6,1579875696.0,Aw thank you!
bulletjournal,ffe0keq,t3_et26ke,1579833582.0,Omg I love this! How cute!
bulletjournal,ffdq3fd,t1_ffcys9k,1579826250.0,"Hahaha yes, the leg lamp is perfect!"
bulletjournal,ffcr5iq,t3_eswl6q,1579805546.0,This is incredible! I can’t believe you drew all of this!
bulletjournal,ffcpvir,t3_esxa0i,1579804702.0,"I have no idea why, but my theme for the year is lights. So each month I’m drawing a different type of lamp, chandelier, lighting fixture, etc. for the cover page. I choose a very over-the-top Victorian style lamp for February. 

Do you have a favorite style of lamp? Or suggestions of lamp styles for the remaining 10 months? Lol"
bulletjournal,ff331h4,t3_er5b9l,1579532384.0,"Psshh, there’s no such thing as too many stickers!"
bulletjournal,ff32w29,t1_ff2g8w7,1579532267.0,"I love your space theme! I don’t know if you’re into a lovey-dovey February theme, but for some reason I thought of tea cups/tea pots which could be made as cutesy or not cutesy as you prefer."
HumansBeingBros,ff1tqxs,t1_ff1h9sd,1579485987.0,"I am so sorry that’s how you were treated. I don’t “look” depressed or anxious - I have a full time job, I own a house, I have good credit, etc. On paper I look like I have my life together. People who see me in a store might think I have it together - I look like I’m dressed alright, I have makeup on, my hair is combed. But in reality that may be the first time I’ve even left the house in days after not showering, not sleeping well, not eating well, and wearing the same sweatpants. I may very well have spent the last four days so consumed with anxiety and depression that I’ve completely lost sight of myself. But to a stranger, I could still look “normal”. 

Depression doesn’t “look” like one thing. It’s absolutely terrible that a medical professional said that to you and made you feel that you shouldn’t try to get help. Please find someone else you feel you can talk to if you can. It’s not a waste of time. You’re worth it."
houseplants,feuw031,t1_feryccj,1579390458.0,Thanks for the tip! I hope the rest of yours sprout too :)
houseplants,fep0dty,t1_feojphg,1579309331.0,Was it challenging to get them to grow? I want an army of monsteras.
bulletjournal,fekpppk,t3_ephxj6,1579205042.0,"The last time I tried bullet journaling, I ran into the same problem. What I’ve learned is that daily logs are not for me. It became a chore and eventually I completely stopped keeping up with my journal. 

This time around I’m not doing a daily, or even a weekly spread. I have year-long trackers (bills, savings goals) and monthly trackers (budget, books). And then I have things that are kind of just places for me to put ideas - meal prep options, capsule closet, etc. 

I think the most important thing about bullet journals is making it work for you and your lifestyle."
bulletjournal,fei7uhz,t3_eovt11,1579132225.0,You just sold me on this set of pens! So pretty!
bulletjournal,fei7iah,t1_fegw410,1579132010.0,Yesssss Muji pens are the best. That’s what I use too.
bulletjournal,fehwqm7,t3_ep4n89,1579125390.0,Muji spiral dot grid notebook!
bulletjournal,fehufcm,t3_ep8jou,1579124078.0,That’s one of my goals too! I’m excited to get home from work and start a new book tonight.
bulletjournal,fehu7xz,t1_feh2meg,1579123961.0,"Thank you, that’s kind of you! I love colorful fineliners. They’re so much fun."
bulletjournal,feex75k,t1_feew5dx,1579043170.0,"Hehehe. 

Oh, I meant to ask - where do you buy Milkia notebooks? I tried googling but nothing came up! Mine is actually from Muji."
bulletjournal,feetdi3,t1_feer01x,1579040796.0,"Thank you so much for leaving me such a kind and thoughtful reply!

Not pictured here is the next page in my journal where I wrote down concrete ways to achieve my goals haha. I actually do struggle with anxiety too, and one of the things I put under “don’t sweat the small stuff” was “no one cares if you have a zit!” Under “appreciate what you have” I have things like “resist impulse buying” and also “look at your accomplishments, not just your failures”.  It may seem really random and unrelated to some people, but that’s kinda how I categorize things. 

I also wrote down some things I’ve learned in therapy that I’m working toward so I don’t forget!"
bulletjournal,feeqxoa,t3_eorawh,1579039319.0,Do you happen to be a comic book artist? Your drawing style is incredible!
bulletjournal,feeqf1x,t1_feeatty,1579039018.0,"Thank you! Haha...they might be too noble. But I’m going to try my best. The page right after this is a more detailed breakdown of each goal, but I figured no one needs to see all that."
bulletjournal,feeqc3y,t1_feeafiv,1579038970.0,"Thank you, I appreciate that!"
bulletjournal,feeqaos,t1_fee2nel,1579038947.0,Thank you!!
bulletjournal,fedz0qe,t3_eoocaz,1579022882.0,"I’m late to the game, but it took me a while to seriously consider what my goals are this year. I tried bullet journaling last year and couldn’t get into it, so I’m trying again in hopes that I can make it work! I’m not 100% happy with how I styled this page, but I guess that falls under “not sweating the small stuff”!"
MUAontheCheap,fe6e6ap,t1_fe6dsjj,1578888259.0,"I have a similar problem - except the thing that makes me break out is sunscreen. So many BB creams and tinted moisturizers have sunscreen! I have literally taken to mixing my foundation with my daytime moisturizer (I just do this on the back of my hand when I’m applying my base). It’s nice because I can control the amount of coverage. 

That said, I’m also interested in this tinted moisturizer!"
houseplants,fe5wno1,t3_ensm40,1578876608.0,"In summer months, don’t leave them outside in direct sun. I’m an idiot and I did this once (forgot it on my front porch) and the poor thing got sunburn! It did recover eventually - aloe are pretty hardy plants."
Embroidery,fe431mu,t3_enfa5n,1578855290.0,This is really beautiful! I think it’s really neat how you did a gradient for the leaves. The flowers turned out really nice too.
bulletjournal,fdsb1f1,t1_fdrms62,1578698486.0,I completely get that! I get too worked up about making my journal “perfect” sometimes. It’s nice to just doodle.
bulletjournal,fdqp6pm,t3_emjwrf,1578671881.0,I really like your mushroom drawings! They’re so cute and colorful. I just overall like how you laid out your pages - the washi tape and the borders are cool. Makes me feel inspired to make my journal a bit prettier.
MUAontheCheap,fdqgz6w,t1_fdpkzru,1578666425.0,Ah that’s totally understandable! I’ve actually never tried soap brows but I am curious about it. I’m honestly no expert on brows — I get my brows done at a salon about once every 3-4 months and I just maintain the shape at home. I hope you end up finding a shape that you like and can fill in more easily!
MUAontheCheap,fdpjvzp,t1_fdpedbl,1578630630.0,"Congratulations!! I’m personally a fan of glossier boy brow, but I have thick/messy/generally unruly brows that need to be put in their place. That might not be ideal for you if you’re looking to build them up more. I use ABH brow wiz to fill in my bald patches and I like that I can achieve pretty thin hairlike strokes with it. NYX’s micro brow pencil is a pretty good dupe for it! 

Btw, I only cautioned against shaving your brows off because when I was in high school I had a waxing accident...waxed half my eyebrow clean off and to this day the tail still doesn’t grow in properly."
MUAontheCheap,fdpdzx7,t1_fdp6joo,1578626214.0,I actually think your filled in brows look nice! Don’t shave off your brows! Have you ever considered microblading?
AskReddit,fdl02qf,t1_fdjwt8f,1578514662.0,"This happened to me, but with my husband’s uncle the first time I met him! Incredibly embarrassing."
tea,fd5nj13,t1_fd2i8wz,1578179399.0,Paris and hot cinnamon spice are my personal favorites! They both make excellent tea lattes if you’re into that as well.
bulletjournal,fcyx6bq,t3_ejl4h5,1578089040.0,This is really elegant!
bulletjournal,fcyx2i0,t3_ej8773,1578088973.0,I really like your drawing style! This is so cute!
MUAontheCheap,fct0y64,t3_ehjbrn,1577930038.0,"I’m really loving NYX setting sprays! I used the matte finish all summer and I’ve switched to the dewy one. Both are great and since they’re not prestige brands at Ulta, they’re often eligible for coupons."

Youniqueamua,fckd0t7,t1_fck47ep,1577722580.0,"What a warm welcome back to Facebook! Well, at least I have plenty of comebacks I’ve gathered from reddit in case a hun tries to get at me through other channels."
Youniqueamua,fcjwzux,t1_fcjrw9x,1577708717.0,"25 years?! Wow. I count myself super lucky that I’ve rarely ever gotten a message from a hun of any kind - though I did delete my Facebook a few years ago, so maybe that’s what keeps me out of range. My last recollection of being sold to was by someone who was pushing those Jamberry nail wraps."
Youniqueamua,fcjwrqm,t1_fcjna9u,1577708435.0,"Ah well, I’ll have to check at some of the stores near me that sell organic food and such. Who knows, maybe I’ll get lucky!"
Youniqueamua,fcjmc3p,t1_fcjhwif,1577693668.0,I’ve actually never heard of Neal’s Yard - I had to google it! I am so intrigued. Where do you buy their products? Looks like their only currency options on their site are pounds or euros (I’m in the US). I did see that some of their stuff is available on Amazon though.
Youniqueamua,fcj9hl0,t1_fcihwji,1577680611.0,Oh god...I wasn’t even aware. I’ve been buying Body Shop products from Ulta for years and I had no idea they started an MLM. Yikes. Guess I better look for a different brand of tea tree oil.

MUAontheCheap,fccejik,t1_fcabcom,1577597487.0,I’m glad I’m not alone in this - though my situation is really weird because I get ONE brow hair that grows in grey. I pluck it and it just comes back grey. I have no idea when it started happening but it drives me nuts because it’s in the middle of my eyebrow and it’s noticeable because I have dark hair.
