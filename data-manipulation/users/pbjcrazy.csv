relationships,ffigs9r,t3_etl7ge,1579973510.0, Years ago my ex-fiancee left me.  I've dated and had serious committed relationships over the last seven years but I still got emotional over hearing how he's engaged again.  I would never be with him again but sometimes people leave you wondering 'what if?' and it can be hard to get over.  That doesn't mean he's not committed or that he doesn't love you.  But take that with a grain of salt and as other comments said I'd still be wary of continuing a relationship
instant_regret,ffeccgk,t1_ffe1r5z,1579842935.0,"Time slows down and the pain persists for what seems like eternity.  You know that feeling you get when you've got horrible diarrhea?  Plus the urge to throw up.  You cant move but every fiber of your being is begging you to crawl away from a pain you cant escape.  If you could, you would rip off your bottom half and throw it as far away from you as possible.  Then, after a few weeks, the pain starts to fade.  You begin to slowly go back to normal.  In reality it may have been a minute or two, but the experience is vivid and lasting."

Advice,ff7qzjq,t1_ff7mn0k,1579656232.0,Lol if it were that easy.  I'm a hard person to love and I'd hate myself forever if I ever lost a friend like him.

Advice,ff7mhay,t1_ff7lpzv,1579653078.0,"Well he's very straight and I'm gay but he's totally awesome.  He got ordained to marry his lesbian friends, and even though he projects that ""I'm very straight"" aura he's totally awesome.  If he was bi/gay though I'd totally want to date him, no doubt about that."

Advice,ff7fxlm,t1_ff7f9jm,1579648639.0,"My roommate is super cool.  Like, I threw away the packaging in the kitchen garbage can so he definitely saw that I bought one but there was also everything else I had too.  Nothing niche or extreme but he did say that the 18""er was surprising because of how short I am and he asked me about some of the other stuff he's never heard of, like poppers."

Advice,ff7eszg,t3_ery77n,1579647892.0,Just get a plastic toolbox from Lowe's or walmart and a lock or two.  If she asks whats inside tell her its private and it's not up for discussion.  If she persists then become deaf and answer her questions as if she's asking about school/work/tv shows.  It's none of her business and it's time to draw a big fucking line in the sand when it comes to your privacy.
