No worries. You don't need to get every joke. I guarantee that there are many jokes I don't get. Maybe I should have started my original post with ""(pushes glasses up to bridge of nose) Well tek-nik-lee..."". I just didn't think anyone would need it.

The problem is, you were actually looking for a teacher/student dynamic where you speak while I shut up. When that didn't happen, you turned to personal attacks while implying that I was the hostile one. But you said it ""politely"", so that's ok I guess?

There is no probably about it. It is quite certain that *almost every* number hasn't been said or even contemplated as an individual. Numbers are infinite, but the largest named number I have ever heard of is a Centillion which is a 10 followed by 303 zeros. 1 Centillion seconds is about 20x longer than the universe has existed.

Edit: [The value of the rupee has dropped by about 1/3 VS. USD in the last 10 years](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate_history_of_the_Indian_rupee) whereas the value of gold is still up 50% over the same period.

Your rupee chart shows that the rupee has been showing a steady decline over the last 10 years, though. That chart shows how many rupees are in each USD, therefore a line going up shows value going down. This is why they invest in gold."
