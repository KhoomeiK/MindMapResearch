Young people phone in when shit doesn't work or they'll throw a suggestion at sth anti-intuitive once.

So he probably didn't see it as using the situation to his benefit, he saw it the way Rory saw sleeping with Dean: he's my Dean, he was like first. Christopher probably thought of Lorelai as always his, a little.

That said, and as much as I think Christopher is an immensely flawed character and helping someone cheat is never okay, Lorelai made the decision to sleep with Chris, she had agency in this. They have been drunk together without anything happening in prior seasons, I think she chose to do the 1 thing she knew would drive Luke away because she knew he'd come back to repair the ultimatum and for some reason her emotional state didn't want to let him. So she took the drastic decision to sleep with Christopher."

I'm dealing with heartbreak coupled with having to break contact with my best friend (don't date your best friend, y'all), and I've been crying through all my non-easy runs. Yesterday I did a tempo run and had to stop omw home because jogging and crying was messing up my ability to breathe. Cried 2 more hrs on and off getting home and honestly, when a cry is instigated by a run, it's the most cathartic and conducive to working through those emotions.

So 6 pills, not sure if that's daily or with all meals or whatever. She also got herself on the course to fatty lover's disease, had her gall batter removed last year and now had stints put in because she keeps getting pancreas infection.

When I went to visit her and she talked about how she was, she said the doctor told her again about the fatty liver but it's no big deal because it's in a stage where it's reversible simply by losing weight. And I was struggling to ask her then why she didn't in the year between her first operation and now. 

People are just so addicted to food, managing it only comes after a huge scare. Sometimes being pre-diabetic at 24 isn't one, having to start shooting insuline when pregnant isn't one, fatty liver, gall blatter removal and multiple pancreas infections aren't one either.

They think a lot of 'clean eaters' are using their food plan/way of life as a way to mask their eating disorder but that doesn't mean that eating as little processed foods or eating a whole foods plant-based diet is the same ans an eating disorder.

I honestly think Rory wasn't a good journalist and wouldn't do well in a freelance lifestyle or not living in a small community and having to fend for herself.

I think she picked a career that didn't suit her personality traits and can believe she was so set on doing just that, that she doesn't realize maybe she should look at her strengths and change course a little. I could see that happening before the revival.
I thought she'd either be struggling in the career she picked as a child and stayed with or striving in a completely different field. I bet she'd be good as a scholar doing research in the soft sciences, working at a ivy league school, even being in publishing vs being the writer, even going into preservation of books or heritage would have been great for her. And she would have enjoyed as well as excelled in them.

She was probably a good writer but a bad journalist and decision maker and had zero insight into herself as a person. She could have flourished in a bunch of elite areas.

fatlogic,fdknveb,t1_fdkkoip,1578507469.0,Yeah just difference in lean muscle mass can make a huge difference.
fatlogic,fdknp97,t1_fdkbhww,1578507366.0,"When I was fat I naturally ate less outside and more inside my house. And I thought that was how everyone did it. So everyone ate more than me when eating out and told me I ate so little and I saw them eating loads thinking they'd eat as much as me at home as well and couldn't understand why I was fat and they were skinny.

Now I'm skinny and will eat a whole pizza or 3 courses when I'm out but it only a fraction of that at home because no one needs restaurant portions for every meal."
fatlogic,fdj9jmk,t1_fdi7swn,1578462404.0,"In all fairness, if she's 250lbs and really eating 1200 kcal, you'd notice the water weight drop and then fat loss pretty quickly. If you're working with a 200kcal deficit, it def takes time."
fatlogic,fdj9ee3,t1_fdiaj0e,1578462276.0,Still bummed they stopped making them at some point. Did they ever make more than 4 seasons?
fatlogic,fdj90tt,t1_fdi6qnz,1578461942.0,"They could potentially also be missing 1 thing they need to track and completely fuck up their estimates. Like not tracking oil when cooking or not weighing peanut butter could be 300+ kcal a day.

That said that probably won't make you 50lvs overweight but it can definitely cut your entire deficit if you're a tiny sedentary lady."

fatlogic,fdhx24g,t1_fdeb09d,1578431710.0,Do you think there are a lot of actually immobile rich people due to obesity? I can't imagine there are but how would I know?
fatlogic,fdhwu6c,t1_fdhefrh,1578431592.0,"She was only 8 months sober when they met but her therapist thought it would be a good idea. But when I tell my friend that maybe there's a reason NA says a year minimum sobriety, he just says 'but her therapist thinks it's a good idea' so yeah I get why he believes a therapist before a layman."
fatlogic,fdhcxyr,t1_fdgnvdk,1578420144.0,"A friend of mine was talking about how his girlfriend just piles food onto a table when they have dinner, always taking way too much than what she should or can eat but still eats all of it e cause she just can't stop. She's in recovery for a narcotics addiction and she used to have a restrictive ED coupled with excessive exercise and after going into rehab for her narcotics addiction and alcohol abuse, she went from 110lbs to 200+ in 8 months.

They've only known each other for 4 months but he's already heavily the main point of support and I'm scared for him because she has so many addictions/problems to work through and I'm scared she's using him as a crutch or new addiction to make her feel better. 

Plain overeating without restrictive cycles or binging or purging is 100% a disorder but doesn't get seen that way at all. It boggles my mind."
