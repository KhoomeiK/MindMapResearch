SuicideWatch,fdfeecd,t3_ekwqyi,1578359741.0,"People help not when they are guilt tripping you are telling that it will get better (indirectly or directly) but more when they’re just here. That you can talk to them without fearing that what you will say will hurt them. That they can still make you have good moments. 

Big talks has never helped me, always made me stress more. But my father who is just teaching me who to drive even if he knows who bas I am is way more helpful.

Talking doesn’t always help. If you really wanna talk don’t guilt trip. Don’t say « everyone loves you » because we know it ain’t true and that also means that we are going to hurt everyone. Don’t say things you don’t believe yourself. Be true and sincere, and don’t do all of the talking, let her talk, share her feelings, make her laugh to release the pressure of such serious topics.

Hope I helped"
depression,fdfdqab,t3_ekviws,1578359293.0,I feel that. And them I isolate myself because I don’t wanna bother and after I don’t understand the jokes because I wasn’t there so I isolate myself more and more

AskReddit,fd3njei,t1_fd2p9cf,1578160009.0,"I am French and I hate France. Yeah the cliche is that it’s the country of love ext.. but in real we have the highest rate of suicide of Europe, depression is high, nobody will open up like that. 

Most people will act like assholes because it ain’t a natural thing to be nice at first and it’s really rare that someone smile to you in the streets. You’ll only get dirty looks even if they don’t mean it.

Foreigners aren’t that well seen (mostly in Paris) because there’s a lot of tourists since we have 80 millions tourists per year which is more than the population. And you add the nasty behavior which is commun then you have people who will easily insulte you. There’s also a lot of racism against almost everyone even people of the same country (a lot hates parisians, people from Guyane ext..) 

School systems aren’t that bad but the inequalities are fucking huge. It’s impossible to run and do something here because everyone has an opinion and will scream it on the street (even if it’s a really important right we should negotiate more and fight against the police less). Everyone are so divided that one of the biggest rule on a family meeting is don’t talk politics at table. 

Seriously some family are in a fight since years because of politics (mine as well). 

Paris is one of the most expensive city in the world but flats are super small there. Paris has almost all the power, political, economic and is six time as big as the seconde largest city in terms of population. There’s so many people in a really small area. The city it self is dirty once you get away from the « nice places ». Again there are big inequalities in the city such as people from Paris (2 million) have access to the best schools freely when people from the suburbs have shitty school and when I’m saying shitty I’m saying that the kindergarten of my neighborhood (I have to admit that my neighborhood is the worst in France)is used as a drug hiding place. And if you want a good school who isn’t the one you’ve been assigned (depending where you live) then you’ll have to pay.

But still most people in France are in the 1% of the richest people of the world thanks to the minimum salary. Our health care is not that great but way more than in the USA or England. We are an angry people but when you start to know people they’re less agressive. 

But yeah France kinda sucks"

SuicideWatch,fcxcp65,t1_fcxc08j,1578059337.0,"Guess I wish my friend didn’t killed herself. That I wasn’t trans because it sucks to be uncomfortable with your own body. That I wasn’t in this competitive school where if you don’t have the results you are  fired. That I wasn’t depressed for nothing or at least not since I am 7 because fuck that don’t make sense since nothing ever happened to me. 

Guess I don’t know much but I just hate my self and I wanna die I just wanna go. 
Be someone else so I don’t hurt the people I love

And I just complain I shouldn’t. I shouldn’t have posted that.
