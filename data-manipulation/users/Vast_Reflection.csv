Also if she is now a roommate, that pays rent and helps with bills, encourage her to confront him. She can’t expect you to fight her battles for her. But at the same time, you should be willing to defend her from comments like that. 

My FWB has me over at his place and his roommate was also one to make comments. My FWB shut down each comment until his roommate and I were able to talk on our own and now we have a kind of communication between us and it’s nice. I had to get used to him, and we found where the boundaries were with each other. 

Also, if he can hear you guys having sex, either you guys should be quieter if he is complaining about it, if he’s not complaining, then it shouldn’t matter. I’m assuming you are all around the same age, so it shouldn’t matter if someone gets too loud, unless they say that it bothers them.

As for the stuff everywhere, just let him know that your expectation is that maybe like once a week, he cleans up his stuff from the shared areas or something?"

And it’s far too common, and much more spotlighted in this current culture. I’ve also been around guys who have been put in that kind of situation - one guy’s female cousin said she was going to the cops, and he had been alone with her so she definitely could have pursued it. Another was drunk and his girlfriend wasn’t and she basically told people he raped her, to the point where he almost failed out of a class because the teacher got involved. 

Could there be a compromise of leaving the door open? And she could check in? I don’t know. Honestly, she’s trying to protect you and she’s right in that. However, you’re not going to be 16 forever, so . . . Well, what can she do once you go off on your own? Not much. I dunno.

Either way, I’ve been thinking a lot about this. I never thought I’d doubt myself finding someone. But then I did find someone and I saw them do something that goes against everything I stand for and it made me feel so conflicted because I still care about them. Anyway, I’m beginning to think love isn’t what we grew up thinking it was. We got fed the idea of romantic love being this huge thing, entire movies and songs are made about it. But I am beginning to think that it’s really just finding someone you can understand and understands you. And while that can be difficult, it also doesn’t always look like what we think it does.
