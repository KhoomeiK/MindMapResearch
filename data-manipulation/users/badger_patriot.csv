YouShouldKnow,ff0wfb0,t1_ff0ofyw,1579472914.0,So? We are bullshitting on the internet.
YouShouldKnow,ff0wc9b,t1_ff0m8o2,1579472885.0,My point is that cost isn't the limiting factor. It's the manufacturing processes that don't exist yet which is the limiting factor. It's not a matter of scaling up production it's making HUGE leaps in materials science that would need to be accomplished.
YouShouldKnow,ff0l4eb,t1_ff0ishn,1579469855.0,That is still theoretical. We have no way of producing perfect single walled carbon nanotubes without imperfections. Cost isn't the only limiting factor. We don't have a process to manufacture the material needed.

worldnews,fdtfng5,t3_en2joq,1578716077.0,Certainly not what I expected Iran to do. The evidence was starting to become overwhelming though so just owning up to it would fit better with their strategy to gain more sympathy from other countries.

Showerthoughts,fdf1lhk,t1_fdexpmo,1578351239.0,It implies that you don't have control over your body by allowing the government to make the choice for you. The default option should always be no unless you give your consent.

worldnews,fdagtt9,t1_fdagafl,1578245955.0,I'm not trying to put you down. It's just that I can't imagine not knowing what the military is like and it makes me happy that you don't have any need to worry about those kinds of things.
worldnews,fdadx6g,t1_fd9wsfg,1578245003.0,This comment is so innocent and cute. It honestly makes me happy that you have no concept of how a modern military works. I think it's a testament to the Free world we've built that you exist.

Really there are three but the one formed by the leading edge of the wings merges with the one from the nose and become indistinguishable. 

It's ok to change what you think and learn something new."

GetEmployed,fcieyjk,t1_fcie12o,1577661528.0,"I assume you didn't even look for one. Or at least not very hard. Bottom line is you need industry experience if you want to follow your ""dream"". Expand your search to survey crews, concrete testing, batch plant processing, etc. Without that employers are going to be EXTREMELY hesitant to hire a foreigner in an engineering field."
GetEmployed,fcibxst,t3_ehcxhv,1577660295.0,You need industry experience. Look for drafting jobs and go from there. Most countries are not going to hire engineers that were trained in different standards than their own. That is especially true in the civil field where factors of safety and standards are extremely important and professional engineers are licensed.

That monster had every intention of killing people that day and the fact that no one actually died is entirely because of incredible good fortune and medical care.
