ABoringDystopia,ffe07g6,t1_ffd0l9l,1579833325.0,"This. ""Unskilled"" labor is not supposed to be an insult. It's not like a slur or something that people use to depress wages. The word is not a linguistic trick, and you shouldn't get distracted by  it.

Don't get me wrong. The minimum wage should be over $20/hr, and ""unskilled"" labor is way WAY undervalued due to corporate greed.

BUT u/CptMisery is right. ""Unskilled"" means not trained for a significant period of time before taking the job. Replacing an unskilled laborer is much easier than replacing a skilled laborer, because there are inherently fewer skilled laborers due to the training requirement.

So engineers, doctors, therapists are skilled laborers.

I agree that landscapers, manual laborers, and waiters often have a ton of skills that skilled laborers don't have. And they are often very good at what they do. If they are, then they can usually demand higher rates, because replacing them would be more difficult.

I'm not arguing against OP here. I'm just pointing out that this linguistic argument is not effective. There are a million ways to criticize the absurd minimum wage, and the terrible corporations like Walmart and Amazon that rely on government programs to pay their workers. This is not one of them."

tumblr,ffag44f,t1_ff9xgt0,1579734946.0,"Yeah, I come from a large adoptive family where we fostered many kids and adopted 5. Only one of them was a baby. All of them had special needs.

So, all I can say about this post is that, while it expresses a nice sentiment, it is extremely naive.

Unfortunately, foster care is a shitty system (although better than orphanages), and people who have spent years in that system have problems that MOST people aren't equipped to deal with.

I don't know how my parents did it.

I definitely experienced some older foster kids who did some things that were hard to explain. Selling drugs and stealing were the most common thing. They weren't that bad, except that the kid would deny it until it became a massive issue. Some of the girls in the system did things that I cannot explain with words, nor classify as easily. Emotional terrorism is probably the best way to put it.

So yeah, it's good to be positive about foster kids and adoption, but it's naive to think that parenting a kid from the foster system is at the same level as parenting your own kid. It's just not."

lolwut?

I mean, I agree that the writing was the weakest aspect of some of the MCU films. I still don't understand the plot to Thor 2.

But the writing was worse for every Defenders show, with several small exceptions. Season 1 of JJ had better writing. The first 6 episodes of Luke Cage were tremendous, and yes, had better writing.

The writing for Ward Meachum was great. Why was it so bad for Iron Fist himself? Do I need to repeat the meme?

So maybe you mean ONLY Daredevil and Punisher had better writing. Okay, Daredevil and Punisher had better writing than the other Marvel Netflix shows, but barely. Daredevil was still mostly melodrama made up of consecutive scenes of two people chatting back to back to back. Even when Stick was there.

mash,fe9gt3g,t3_enzmru,1578937427.0,"It has nothing to do with character.

The writers were adhering to a structure that required certain characters.

That's why, when (most) of the characters were replaced, they were replaced with near identical substitutes. For Hawkeye to be Hawkeye, he must be rebelling AGAINST someone. There must be a foil. That was Frank. When they lost him, they needed Winchester.

The same thing applies to Trapper/Hunnicut. Hawkeye needs a partner in crime so that he isn't always talking to himself.

No, the characters aren't EXACTLY like their replacements, but each must fill a specific role in the setup of the show.

That's why Frank was such a prick.

I think Hot Lips softened over the seasons. It started out that she was Frank's partner in crime, but when he left, she had to change.

I also think Hot Lips just got the worst writing. 90% of the writing credits go to men, so I think she might be an example where sexism/exclusion played a part. That's pure speculation on my part though."

LetsTalkMusic,fcl88k4,t3_ehplge,1577741936.0,"There are lots of reasons to follow or admire a musician. Many of them have NOTHING to do with music. In fact, most of them have nothing to do with music. This isn't something new. It has been this way literally forever.

Many popular musicians are popular more for their brand than for their music. Britney Spears is the go-to example of this, but it equally applies to many pop groups. Ex: Justin Bieber, Vanilla Ice, pretty much all of the Jackson siblings.

Many popular musicians are popular because their music serves a social function. This is especially true of dance music. The music itself is secondary to dancing and socializing and being part of the scene. Ex: Tiesto, Avicii, many disco acts.

There's nothing wrong with liking music for any of these reasons.

BUT often this music fails to reward listeners who are looking for deeper musical experiences. Layered experiences that reward repeat, focused listening.

In this sense, much pop music is not taken very seriously as music. Usually academics think of this music as entertainment, and don't learn much more from analysis than can be learned from surface level listening.

Usually.

The most interesting acts (imho) are the ones who achieve popular success, often due to branding, or other non-musical factors, but are actually creating deep, rewarding music. Some of these acts are dismissed as less serious, even when they are making serious music.

The best example of this is ABBA. You could also put Queen into this category, and many of the black rappers from the 80s and 90s were dismissed as popular fads until recently.

YES! There's certainly SOMEONE who is making serious K-Pop music. But I don't know any K-Pop except BTS, so I can't say who that someone is. Maybe it's BTS."
