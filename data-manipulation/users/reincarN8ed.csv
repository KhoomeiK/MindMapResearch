PlayTemtem,fffsaha,t1_fffn2cy,1579890705.0,"Don't preach semantics to me, because I just straight up won't listen to you after that. If someone is selling a product, whether its early access, or a beta, or ver 1.0, it doesn't matter; they are still charging money for that product. Its effectively the same thing as a launch, only with the expectation that content will be missing at launch and be added later. Now I will pay $35 for a product that is missing content with the promise that content will be added later (provided I trust the developer, and in this case I do). I'll pay a fraction of the full price for a fraction of the full content. But what I won't pay for is a broken product. And you know who else shares this mantra? [The devs of this game.](https://twitter.com/PlayTemtem/status/1220105783293153280) They straight-up recommended that players who were unhappy with the stability of the servers should refund it through Steam, so I did. Even the devs themselves don't expect their players to pay for a broken piece of software, so they are working tirelessly to fix it."
