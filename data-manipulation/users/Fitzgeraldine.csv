Before I got my recent dog I applied for one single other dog and got declined too. I didn’t mind back than. However this dog is still in shelter, I check 3-4 times a year.

bigboobproblems,ffbp4s6,t3_esqpae,1579776688.0,"Personal experience:

I started with physiotherapy a year ago to relieve my back pain and improve my posture. It helped me so much! I also try to correct my posture whenever I notice I’m sloppy, just sit /stand up right again and again and again building up that muscle memory. I’m in process but a improve is notable.

**I don’t think it’s for everybody the same, but in my case two very easy practice helped a lot.** I included both to my yoga routine and everyday life. 
1) Pull in belly. Not fully, just medium. Do it whenever you lift something or carry something in your everyday life. This will support your back, stabilize your core and on long term improve posture / relieve back pain. Additionally I did 10mins of deep breathing exercise twice a day including abs stress/relax. I noticed it became much easier after a while, so I did it more often during the day. Don’t push to hard, this won’t help. Take it easy. Btw. you can pull up your pelvic at the same time and train this too...
2) Twice a day for about 5 minutes I lift my sternum slightly. Start with Yoga mountain pose (stand up straight, twist your arms outwards and open your palms). Then very very slightly pull your shoulder blades towards your spine. That’s the difficult part. You have to use only the muscle between the blades on your back, don’t push it with the shoulder muscles. I think it was Rhomboideus? Pull them together, don’t push. At the same time very very gentle push you sternum to the sky. It’s very difficult to get this right when you just start it but easy as soon as you got it.

**Anyway I guess this should be supervised by professionals at least in the beginning to learn the exercise** ***correctly.***"

I’m sure you can figure it out!"
reactivedogs,fexoyjw,t3_eqrvkp,1579434254.0,"IMHO the other comments said the most important things about reactiveness already and I would just repeat. But I’d like to give you an advice about your walks since this might be one minor part of the problem. No matter if you keep your Terrier or have another dog one day there’s a thing a lot (new) dog owners don’t know: 
1) Dogs are very adapting when it comes to energy. The more you exercise him the more hyper he’ll get. You need to teach(!) your dog, specially high energy breeds, to calm down, to rest, to relax. An adult dog should averagely rest or sleep for about 18-20h a day. Contrariwise if you exercise him not enough, some dogs get destructive to get rid of their energy and boredom, but other will get lazy, sleepy, depressed. Owners of the last kind often think they do great, but when your dog is tired after non or very short walks that’s not a good sign either. It’s difficult to find the best balance as a beginner since it’s difficult to read your dogs body language. Walking him 4 times a day for 10minutes is not enough, walking him 4 times a day for 1h is to much.
2) Quality not quantity. For some dogs it’s heaven if they can just sniff around on your walks, other breeds need additional stimulation. Always check the origins of your dogs breed (or mixed breeds) and research what job they were bred for. Their genetics will often explain their hobbies. A Retriever, per example, will be very happy if you weave some dummy training or swim session in your daily walk.

I’m not an expert, but I fostered a Jacky for 2 years until he found the perfect furever home. For him, and all Terriers I ever had, mind exercise was more important than walks. Jackys are high energy, very smart and agile. First things first teach them to calm down (high energy control). Next step we introduced him to different tasks for his mind like puzzle games (intelligence). Twice per week we went to agility class (agile). Nightmare walkies turned to relaxed strolls. [However he didn’t have any trauma and was not reactive! This was his individual exercise, that’s not a statement how much exercise a dog needs!] Giving a dog the opportunity to act out his assets in a controlled environment will provide him a lot of joy and strength your bond. This base will help you a lot in training for other issues.

In your situation I recommend to restart your schedule. Both you and your dog are probably overwhelmed by the situation. Take it slow. Bond and build up trust at home, do a minimum outside atm.  Go for walks on a time at the day when not many other peoples are out. Very early on Sunday mornings works fine in my neighborhood. You can introduce him to the environment in peace without overwhelming distractions. Search calm and quiet places. Practice calmness and focus indoor, then outdoor without distraction and build this slowly up. You’ll develop a grasp for your dogs state of energy. There’s a point where he’ll lose focus. You should stop training sessions / be back home before this happens. Everything else is perfectly described in the other comments. Good luck!"

Thus I’ll wear a tight round neck shirt or tank (with rather short straps it’s not supposed to show cleavage) and cover it with a medium lose V neck shirt / long sleeve / cardigan... Open cardigan will work fine as long their straight vertically lines draws thirds on the chest. If it falls open to much they’ll just looked framed and even bigger. For additional effect use darker colors on the outside and lighter colors (not gaudy) in the center (like a penguin), this will slim the silhouette and therefore also slim the chest. In the end those layers create lines that will visually cut your chest in smaller parts. With these tricks my cups usually are estimated 3 sizes smaller (until my friends see me in bikini first time and get shocked how I hid those monsters so well)."
AskReddit,febkvv8,t3_eo6l00,1578959896.0,"We had this awful angry teacher. Every time she’ll enter class with the words “Don’t ya dare to do anything stupid I’m already pissed from the previous class.” One day some student answered “It’s kinda unfair to threat us every day just because the other class isn’t listening”. Teacher slammed her purse on the table, yelling “THAT’S ENOUGH! I WARNED YA!” she started going through her paper sheets mumbling „You’ll do a surprise exam now. We’ll see how bold you‘ll be when all your grades drop rock bottom”. But she didn’t not have any sheets ready for our class so she gave us the exam for the class 5 grades above us with subjects we never learnt. The whole class refused to take the test. We all stood up together and left the classroom calm and serene. She was not able to give us all F since this would bring herself in trouble with the rector and prove her issues."

reactivedogs,fdw0jn2,t1_fdvu8qo,1578753726.0,"Imagine you are experiencing something traumatic (1) and before you can process it, you are torn from your familiar environment and move to a completely strange place (2). Additionally (3) you now have a roommate with whom you do not get on. He annoys you every day or even attacks you. Your stress level rises and rises, you cannot relax, you cannot settle in, let alone deal with trauma. When you’re out for a walk you’re in constant stress (2&3) and maybe also fear (1&3). Yet strangers of all kind keep approaching, intruding your personal space. You’re so fed up, bursting out to defend yourself (4). And while you probably wish someone would just give you a break, keeping them away,  your family will rant on you instead (5).

It’s harsh, it’s exaggerated and I don’t intend to make you feel bad. I just anthropomorphized the situation to give you another view. Its easy to point out mistakes from the past. It’s hard to see that signs in the present or even forecast them. It’s really hard (actually impossible) to give a proper advice without ever seeing the dog in action. Therefore whatever you read here from anyone should be taken with a grain of salt anyway and not too personal. Don’t waist energy to blame yourself, rather be ready to help her improving again.

IMHO It can be summed down to 1) Attacked by dogs, 2) everything changed, 3) constant stress cause by a dog, 4) Succeed many times with this behavior causing the opponent to leave (owner taking their dogs away from her, parents saving their kids...) for sure so she learnt this is the perfect behavior to get what she wants: space! 5) no backing from her loved ones. 

If you’re lucky she will get a little stress relief when she doesn’t have to share her home with another dog anymore (3). Just because the stop fighting doesn’t mean they don’t cause stress to each other. Give her time to settle in the new surrounding after moving back to Texas (2), than start training and re-socialization. Find a good trainer with positive methods and experience for traumatized dogs to supervise your progress. If she’s in fear more pressure won’t be a good thing. It will take time and probably it will take more than 9 months. No one can forecast how she’ll react to a newborn. Yes, some dogs feel special bonds to the kids of their owner but there’s no such thing as a guarantee and usually this happens when the dog has a very strong bond to the parents too. If it’s like I assume, you’ll have to strengthen that bond again cause she might felt like you’ve let her down in certain situations (4&5). Don’t let anyone approach her, give her space, speak up and protect her so she does not need to do it herself anymore."

bigboobproblems,fdqf8aw,t3_emlieb,1578665138.0,"Like the others already wrote, when your band size gets smaller but your boobs stayed the same it’s actually a bigger cup in sizing. The letter in bra size **refers to the difference** of your chest measurement compared to your band size. Since your boobs stayed same size but band got smaller, the difference between both of them rises and so does the letter.

The stores here are stocking up on range for a while now but some years ago I couldn’t find any bra in my size and online shopping was a nightmare. Therefore I asked some stores if they would order the bras to the store **to fit me correctly**. Most shop assistants didn’t care and refused without even checking if it’s possible. But two expensive high quality stores with handmade lingerie excelled in customer service and did without even making a fuss about. Stores often get their order faster delivered than customers, also you won’t have to pay in advance nor dealing with return. I was a student back than and really struggled to pay so that much for a bra. Tbh I went like fake it till you make it and act like the prizes don’t even bother me on this total usual shopping day. It’s sad but often the truth: Vendors treat you superior if they smell a good deal with lots of money. Ugh. However they ordered the whole range of my size +/- sizes above and below to make sure they’ll find a bra that fits me - and we did! This bra was such a game changer! I bought it. I had to resign some other stuff to afford that bra, but it was so worth it."

AskReddit,fdm5x2g,t3_eluch8,1578540578.0,"This isn’t my worst pain but still horrific and a better story. My lower wisdom teeth didn’t grew upwards like they should but lay on their side growing forwards into the fang of the other teeth. The fangs got distorted causing a lockjaw. The surgery took 2h for each wisdom tooth, being full awake with local anesthesia only (because of the lockjaw they needed me to cooperate or something like that). So I witnessed how they cut open my gingival, digging down the flesh to the teeth lying directly on the bone, telling me it’s to big to get out in one piece and stating to break it several times (17x on the left side, 8x right and yes I have big teeth) before removing each piece. Also my jaw bone wasn’t effected from the anesthesia and had to be drilled to lose the tooth at some points. Ofc all of this got inflamed afterwards to give me the full dentist nightmare experience. I’ve still pits in my gingival back there needing special cleaning since the holes were to big /deep to grow back completely. 

TL;DR My wisdom teeth bumped into my other teeth and needed to be drilled out of my jaw bone in a 4h surgery while I was conscious."
