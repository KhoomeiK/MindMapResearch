In hindsight we were never really friends, they were just using me for attention while they were in between relationships. Once they were ready to start dating/hooking up again, they cast me aside (some literally ghosted me, others just pushed me away) and went after the men they were actually interested in.

So I never stood a chance as a partner, nor was I actually a genuine friend whose company they enjoyed."
