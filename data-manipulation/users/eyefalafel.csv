I guess I didn’t have that fear yet when I was that young, and also I would say I’m ok with it now but I’m better than I was a year ago. Only because I realized it’s the inevitable and it makes no sense to be scared now, and that works, in theory.  And I did go to an elderly home (is that the word? Idk I forgot the English word for it) and it made the whole thing even worse. They were all 80+ but most of them acted child like ( I really don’t mean this word in any negative way possible I’m sorry if it comes out that).
