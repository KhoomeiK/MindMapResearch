What facts?

He wasn't a homeless man. He was a guy that lived in the same apartment complex that would do ""anything gnarly for a quick buck"", trapped upwards of 15 cats in his one bedroom apartment, and eventually tried to bust through his wall to murder his neighbor. This also happened like ten years ago (when he was in art school).

So you're assuming he did want help and he's a stand up guy? Because his actions would imply otherwise.

>Also if someone attempted to get him help rather then do something that most humans would be utterly ashamed of then maybe he could have improved.

Again, this happened when Darby was poor and living in the same apartment complex. Darby had no way to help him, and apparently the dude did ""gnarly shit for money"" all the time. But, whose to say Darby didn't try to get him help? As unlikely as that sounds, neither of us knows for sure, and you're jumping to conclusions by thinking that he did want help or even could be helped.

>Addiction and addicts are something to be taken seriously, I'm sincerely sorry if an addict has hurt you or you had a bad experience or you just don't have that empathy, but they are sick and deserve help.

Sorry, but this is where we disagree. Addicts are addicts for a reason. Yes, its a chemical reaction that they can't control, but they did it to themselves in the first place. As stated, in most cases, people that become addicts are not great, upstanding people to begin with. Yes, there are outliers to this. But given the story, I don't think the guy referenced in story #1 is one of those outliers that just got caught up with the wrong crowd. No, I don't know this for a fact, just as you don't know that he wasn't, yet you're jumping to conclusions and acting as if he's a victim. And the fact of the matter is that you left all of this information out of your post, which led to MORE people jumping to conclusions about ""DARBY IZ SCUM"".

You said he's ""very clearly down on his luck"". How is that more clear than him being a pretty shitty person, based on the fact that he locked cats in his house and tried to bust through a wall to murder a neighbor? Being ""down on your luck"" implies that the person is attempting to do good but can't catch a break. I didn't get that AT ALL from the story--in fact, it was the opposite.

>You can need a fix and want help. It's a chemical reaction in the brain you can't control.

Never said otherwise. Addicts are going to be addicts until they get clean. I don't care if you're an addict IF you actually want help. If you don't want help getting clean and just want a fix, I don't think anyone should feel sorry for you. Especially if you're doing shitty things. My dad was an alcoholic. It ruined his marriage and almost prevented him from having any sort of custody with me. But he recognized the problems that he caused, what caused those problems (his alcoholism) and he got clean. I could not be more proud of him. But I

>We don't know that the guy is cool with it, Darby just spouted it off on air.

Based on another comment to my post, it sounded like the dude was cool with it and Darby sounded like he was trying to help a friend (in a very misguided way). Because you left out information about incident #1, I'm going to go with the other user's comment until I find a way to listen to it myself.

>I would not get pepper sprayed by an early 2000s rock band for free, another weird assumption

I never said *you* would. I generalized and said that most people posting probably would, and I stand by that statement. 

>When Uso drove drunk I made a picture of all his arrest on an old account and posted it here saying he needed help. As for Jeff I wish he would get help too.

And I believe you. You seem like a very caring person, perhaps a bit too caring in some scenarios. That's not a bad thing, and I'm happy that you do seem to give a shit and over-empathize with people rather than not have any empathy at all. But you can still hope someone gets help without giving them your sympathy. I sincerely hope that Jey and Jeff get help. Not just for themselves, but for everyone that is on the road when they decide to drive while they're under the influence. But I absolutely do not feel sorry for them when they get into bad situations because of their own actions. 

People need to be held accountable for their actions--especially addicts."
SquaredCircle,ffdmj6x,t3_esuj9b,1579824055.0,"This will probably be downvoted, but this post (and the subsequent comments within) really rubbed me the wrong way, because I felt like OP was leaving out a lot of details, so I went back and listened to the TIJ episode with Darby (or at least the section that OP refers to in the first bullet). And I'll preface this by saying that while I am a fan of Darby as a character and in ring, I'm not a fan of his real life edgelord anarcho i'm-real-punk-rock persona that he has.

>First the Jericho interview he talks about paying an addict three dollars to shove his face in a toilet that hasn't been flushed in like a week then gleefully wants to show Chris the video.

First of all, the ""victim"" is someone that, according to Darby, tried to burst through his wall to murder his neighbor over a dispute. The same guy also left cat food outside his apartment and then trapped stray cats inside of his apartment, to the point that, according to Darby, he had around fifteen cats in a one bedroom apartment dwelling. I don't know why the OP left this out (oh, probably because it doesn't suit his anti-Darby circle-jerk narrative that he's constructed for updoots) but I feel like its a pretty important detail. This isn't someone that is down on his luck and trying to recover, this is Jimmy Kimmel's shitty cousin that tried to murder someone. Really hard to feel sympathy for someone like that.

Aside from that, Darby was in film school, so this was what... 9-10 years ago? Dude was practically a teenager, and while that's not an excuse for doing stupid shit, most of us did stupid shit when we were his age (especially if your part of that skater culture that grew up idolizing Johnny Knoxville and Bam Margera). 

Darby didn't force the guy's head into the toilet. Darby didn't take advantage of someone that was down on their luck. Darby didn't feed a shit sandwich to a homeless person. This wasn't someone who wanted help to get clean. This was an addict that wanted to make a quick buck for a quick fix. Was it immature of Darby to make a proposition that the dude stick his head in a toilet full of shit and piss? Absolutely. But that doesn't make him a terrible person. 

>Now the Meltzer interview came out and he talks about paying a guy to do jackass type stunts so the guy can pay the courts to maybe get his kid back and then move out of his meth riddled trailer park which he manages.

Now, I can't speak on this because I don't subscribe to WON and don't know what OP is leaving out, so I'm going to take this at face value. This, to me, sounds like Darby giving a guy an opportunity to make extra cash (and meet celebrities) and get internet exposure by doing stupid stunts, which will help the situation that he's currently in. I'm relatively sure most of you would do this for free. 

What I DO take issue with is that he's apparently trying to capitalize on the guy's issues (ongoing court case, custody battle). That is 100% trashy, but obviously the guy is cool with it (otherwise I have a feeling he wouldn't be doing it). That being said, its still gross to me.

But most of the comments bashing Darby aren't about that. Most of the comments I'm seeing are about how ""drug addicts are victims"". No, they aren't. Its absolutely baffling to me that we're now feeling sorry for drug addicts. I've been called a ""bleeding heart liberal"" and ""social justice warrior"" by everyone in my family, but even I can't get behind this whole ""drug addicts are victims"" mentality that half of you seem to have.

There's a reason that drug addicts are in the situation that they are in, and typically they were shady to begin with. Nobody forced meth or heroin into their veins, they did that themselves. And in most cases, they aren't very good people, and will REALLY take advantage of others(stealing from friends and family, robbing other people, etc) in order to get their fix. I know people that have been affected by family members that have become addicted to drugs or alcohol, and I'm sorry, but I can't feel sympathy for those that will hurt their loved ones for a fix. 

Now, if you're a recovering addict, I 110% support you. I will feel empathetic to your plight and will cheer you on the road to recovery. There are many people commenting that they are recovering addicts, and that's AWESOME! I'm proud of you guys that dug yourselves out of that hole. But those that are addicts and don't want help to get clean and just want a fix don't deserve my, or anyone elses, sympathy.

Its so funny to me that Jey Uso and Jeff Hardy drive drunk on a regular basis (something that could legitimately kill innocent people) but you guys are outraged over some immature jackass shit that Darby did ten years ago."

The same Paige that gets pissy about people being too sensitive and defends her racist, homophobic piece of shit boyfriend on twitter for saying WAY more hateful and offensive things than an off color joke about ""having kids she doesn't know about""?  

I've never been a fan, felt absolutely terrible for her when her career ended, I felt bad for her when all the stuff leaked (though why the fuck you would record someone ejaculating on your title belt is beyond me), and then stopped feeling sorry for her during the whole Del Rio fiasco. She's a toxic human being, her family is toxic, she surrounds herself by other toxic people (like Del Rio and Radke) and I really wish that she wasn't re-hired. She really doesn't bring anything to the table. I'm still absolutely perplexed that they made a motion picture about her, of all fucking people."

wow,fdqsmnw,t1_fdqlse8,1578674008.0,"""Alliance got shafted again"". What? I mean, I don't disagree that mechagnomes are lame as fuck (personally I really dislike the Vulpera as well, but at least they're a completely new skin), but the other Alliance allied races are pretty cool.

Dark Iron Dwarves have been a request since vanilla. Kul'Tiran's aren't great, but at least its a body change from normal humans (wheras Mag'har are just recolored orcs with tattoo options)--and they have the coolest looking druid forms ingame. Lightforged are kind of lame to me because white draenei was already an option, but Tauren with moose antlers really isn't that much better. Void elves are pretty dope, as are nightborne. I think Mechagnomes are really the first time alliance has been ""shafted"" with ally races."

DnDBehindTheScreen,fdqro3u,t1_fdps9hg,1578673421.0,"Honestly, I think this is really the key to any great (long) combat encounter. Its so easy for combat encounters (especially long ones) to become boring and monotonous, but if you can create new ""stages"" or ""scenes"" that happen during the battle, it keeps players much more engaged.

I ran a combat encounter that lasted almost a full 3 hour session a few weeks ago that I was terrified of because I knew it would be a long one. My group went into a manor that was being robbed by a gang, had combat on the first floor while NPCs (manor guards and gang members) were fighting on the second floor. Once they finished the relatively benign bottom floor combat, they rushed upstairs to try and help the guards (scene change). Then after like four rounds I had another faction crash through the window to join the fray in an attempt to steal the mcguffin that everyone was after (new stage). 

Another combat encounter I ran was in the underdark with my group fighting the drow in the dark. After something like 5 rounds, I had a Hook Horror come in, drawn by the sounds of combat, and start ripping through both drow and my group members (stage change). 

I try to do the same with boss fights--I ran a halloween one shot with the headless horseman, and split it into three stages, with each stage being triggered by an HP threshold--one with the horseman mounted on a nightmare, the second with the nightmare and the horseman separate, and the third with the nightmare, the horseman and the horseman's floating pumpkin head (with fire breath attacks). My group LOVED each one of these encounters because they kept the group engaged and anxious to see what's going to happen next."

wow,fdqpj8q,t3_emryx2,1578672100.0,"I just hate the look and style of mechagnomes. They look goofy as fuck.

Maybe they'll look better with helmets... 

It would've been cool if they'd BS'd some lore reason to put more races on the opposite faction. Like find some lore reason that the Dark Iron would side with the Horde, or the peaceful Highmountain would ally with the Night Elves. Or if the Alliance made friends with the Nazjatar fish-goblins and got those as an allied race, while Horde got fully mechanical gnomes that want revenge on the flesh gnomes so they side with the Horde after the fall of King Mechagon."
