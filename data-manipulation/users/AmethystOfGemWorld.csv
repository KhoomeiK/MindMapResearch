I finally got the opportunity to go out there with some friends back on ‚Äò99, to San Francisco specifically. While I enjoyed the freedoms and liberties that living in the Bay gave me, like legal marijuana, amazing vistas, endless hiking venues and a slew of interesting adventures. People. Have. Since. Ruined. That. City. I left in 2009 and moved back to Brooklyn. I have been back to visit a couple times a year since then because my daughter lives in Oakland. The city is lacking any type of culture or vibe. Thank you, Google. Thank you, rising rent prices and gentrification."
