SuicideWatch,fd1tyjy,t3_ejjdgq,1578136775.0,"I got a government job at my country with good salary and stability right after graduation. The job had almost 0 relation with my career, was boring and somewhat demeaningful.

After 4 - 5 years working I decided to quit to avoid killing myself, because I felt horrible each and everyday working there to the point that I believe I now have something similiar to PTSD - when I remember my time there I feel like having panick attacks...

Now I'm 29 years old and willing to start over my electronics engineer career in Canada...

So basically I traded a good and stable life for new possibilities in another country, which could bring challenges to keep me occupied and stop thinking about suicide...

TLDR: I believe you should find a job that satisfies your needs to maintain a good work-life relationship so you don't think about suicide..."
SuicideWatch,fctjx13,t1_fct5mo8,1577945915.0,"So true... Society wants people to work and be productive, so suicide is not an option..."
SuicideWatch,fctjp0n,t3_eis7xd,1577945668.0,"I've had this feeling aswell... Used to imagine letting the steering wheel go for something to happen while driving on a bridge or during a sharp turn. Sadly, I always endup taking back control of the car..."

SuicideWatch,fcgy5fh,t1_fcazpra,1577645230.0,"I agree, but I would also add that we humans need to socialize with friends and family to keep a balanced quality of life. The problem is that it gets harder to do this as we become more antisocial and busy as we age."
SuicideWatch,fc52c8c,t3_e5tfi6,1577439485.0,"I feel like I don't care enough about most of the people and things I used to care about anymore. I don't feel sad nor depressed, I'm just empty most of the times. I believe this is what it's like to be normal for most people.

So, yes, I don't worry much about the future. I do make plans but I don't care much because ""exitting life"" is a valid option in the end. This kind of thinking is a safety net for your sanity..."
