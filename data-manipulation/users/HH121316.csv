emetophobia,f6zd6w9,t3_dtw29s,1573314998.0,"You are definitely not alone.  It’s debilitating and so frustrating. I have 2 kids so I’m constantly on edge and I fear they will be like me.  But I will say, I’ve been going to therapy for about 8 months now and we started a new technique called EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing). So far, it’s been great. I feel more in control now. Of course, it’s not 100 percent gone but I can tell I’ve made progress.  Hang in there! Everything will be ok!"
