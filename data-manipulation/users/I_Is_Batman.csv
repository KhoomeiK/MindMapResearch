naturalbodybuilding,ffh648e,t1_ffh5o4k,1579924157.0,"That’s the right mindset! Diets only work temporarily, changing how you eat is the way to go. I advice using MyFitnessPal if you are not currently using it. I have their premium version but tbh don’t really know what the difference is so I wouldn’t advice it unless you feel it will benefit you. 

Good luck and wish you the best of luck! You seem to be on the right path!"
Fitness,ffh3iex,t1_ffe2tt1,1579922117.0,"Facts bro. I got friends that when they see me after sometime they wonder what I’ve been doing to get in shape. Literally by just going and tracking what I eat. Other than just sitting around doing jack shit go workout for even 30-45mins. It makes a big difference.

Oh and the worse is when they chalk it up to either you have good genetics or already used to workout. Nah b I have been putting in work everyday."

wholesomememes,ffgye20,t3_etggt6,1579918249.0,I still remember my eight grade teacher telling my parents that she was worried about the path I was going towards back then. She told them that most of the time the way kids perform in their 8th grade year projects how they will do in life..? This convo happened after me and a couple other people in my class were held back from going to a European class trip due to grades or whatnot.. Something so small from back then has stayed with me even till now. Tbf tho the other two kids who were held back from the trip didn’t continue their education after high school. One whom is working somewhere at a retail job and the other who I think is doing well as a car salesman.

Fitness,fd0boi0,t1_fcza8wu,1578116546.0,You think I have a good frame to cut down to? I’ve read 12% is a good point to cut towards and then bulk up again. Might go a bit lower than that though. Just depends how I feel

Cut down from 200 to 185 and have been maintaining it at this weight for a while now. Thinking about aggressively cutting soon down to maybe 170? Only gripe I have is that I have terrible body dysmorphia and always think I look like DYEL. Currently my macros are around 160g protein along with 2300 calories a day. 

Any estimate on the Bf%? I’m guessing 15ish?

Prefer working with dumbbells for bench nowadays and have been using 90s for my working set, idk how that equates to bench at all though. As for squats, I hate em but slug through.
