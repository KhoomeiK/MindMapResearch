legaladvicecanada,ff3aq5r,t3_erehoh,1579537535.0,"It sounds like they want to say you signed an agreement with a non compete clause. Perhaps start by sending an email to their lawyer asking them, without prejudice, to clarify their source for a non compete clause, as you don't recall ever having signed one. I would ask for the source relied upon to be in writing with your signature next to it in support of his assertions that there is one. 

Then, ask him to seek his client's understanding of the geographic and temporal scope as well as the extent of the activity sought to be prohibited. This is the language used by the leading Supreme Court decision on non compete clauses. 

This will signal to the lawyer that you won't be bullied, and he will possibly encourage his client to back off. 

If you do send something to the other party, have it reviewed by someone able to give you independent legal advice. Drafting it yourself will minimize costs, and a lawyer may actually just do it for free or a minimal fee if you've done all the leg work."
