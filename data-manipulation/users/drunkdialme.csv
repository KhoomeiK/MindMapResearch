bipolar,fe8sk8p,t3_eo00jb,1578930152.0,I've seen a lot of art in this sub but this one captures bipolar perfectly. Well done! I want to post it too!
realwitchcraft,fdrd5mg,t1_fdqpmde,1578682820.0,"You can always grow your own herbs or join a community garden so you can swap with others. And jade is awesome! I've done some intense healing with a piece of nephritic jade! But sodalite is my babe, I think the color calms me down."
schizophrenia,fdq0kbk,t3_eme2g5,1578648878.0,"Treat me like a person please! Not a diagnosis, but an individual who has unique challenges."
realwitchcraft,fdpw53b,t3_emltw3,1578642975.0,"I am also going to jump in and say you don't NEED anything but you. 

That being said, white candles are super versatile. Crystals are very personal. My first crystal I loved was moonstone, then sodalite. Pick whatever vibrates with you most. Use herbs that are local because you don't want to contribute to the over harvesting of Palo Santo and white sage. 

Read read and read some more. The more you learn the more your beliefs will evolve and even change. You don't want to invest in a bunch of crystals then discover you are more attuned to essential oils or something. 

Have fun with it most of all. Some moments will be serious but it needs to stay joyous."

bipolar,fc2m87q,t3_eft4vp,1577366816.0,"When im getting depressed, one of my tells is not putting on lotion after my shower. I have super dry skin so if I don't take this step im just not loving myself. 

For mania, it's shin splints. My legs start to tingle and it's just a few days till I'm in full delusions and hallucinations."
