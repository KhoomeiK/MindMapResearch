The heart rate isn't as accurate as my Galaxy Watch or Fitbit, but it's within 3+5 bpm, so it's tolerable.

GPS tracking is great of paired with your phone (a.k.a you take your phone with you when you walk/run) otherwise acquiring a GPS fix can take a while with just the watch, and the location tracking during your run won't be as accurate as of you had your phone (big antenna vs. little antenna)."

Kobe is still #31 all-time in assists, while also being 4th all-time in points scored. Obviously this pales in comparison to Labron James who already has ~2000 more assists than Kobe, but it's still a solid place.

Dude passed the ball *a lot* considering how prolific he was at scoring."

Trump, and more importantly the Senate, is destroying our faith in democracy.

I love mine, but I'm not a heavy fitness/sleep tracker user, so it's great for me.

Buy it If the following apply:

- DO NOT need sleep tracking
- DO NOT require very detailed/accurate fitness tracking (it works fine for heart rate, steps, distance etc)
- Smooth performance
- Best Google Assistant experience available
- Content with 24-30 hours of battery live (with tilt-to-wake DISABLED) 

Those are the main points, IMO.

It works great, and I use voice dictation to send texts, emails, perform searches, set reminders 10+ times per day. I also have the speaker enabled to I can quickly take calls when I'm on-the-go without having to pull out my phone. 

Also, I cannot recommend Facer enough for getting awesome watch faces, or creating your own to display whatever information you deem the most important."

Here's [Irma's path](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Irma_2017_track.png/1920px-Irma_2017_track.png) and that storm didn't actually maintain its bearing as the man in the video presumed it would.

It actually took a pretty sharp northward turn as it made landfall on South Florida.

With that said, I think our weather bro's statement about it ""not getting much worse than it is right now"", mostly holds true, as Miami and Miami Beach were mostly spared. He was certainly downplaying it a bit, because Miami did get a good amount of rain, flooding and gale-force winds, but it was not ""hurricane-force"" by any measure.
