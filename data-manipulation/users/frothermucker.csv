Warts,ff5ajnf,t3_eroycv,1579585282.0,How long did it take?
AskDocs,fe90wzt,t1_fe8zvoa,1578932983.0,"Don't think it's a cramp. Its almost like I got punched in the thigh and a bruise should be there, but no bruise"
dogs,fe5pj16,t3_envh26,1578872608.0,What do you feed her? Only asking due to diet related DCM (not always picked up on x-ray)
dogs,fdwt8ld,t1_fdwqwxu,1578762109.0,Im not OP. I didn't make the original comment.
dogs,fdwne2e,t1_fdvq6w1,1578760465.0,"There are probably other diets that claim they will help, but there's no evidence to back it up. Prescription diets go through years of testing and have been proven to work. They're formulated by board certified veterinary nutritionists, go through extensive feeding trials, ect. If you feed anything else i feel like you would be doing your dog a huge disservice and could cause other issues."
unpopularopinion,fdkp1ct,t1_fdkh3k1,1578508171.0,Never heard of it until now. When i looked it up it was a mutt (pug x JRT). Is that what you're talking about?
unpopularopinion,fdk0dfu,t1_fdjztde,1578492897.0,So many of them are sold for thousands and that's what makes me think the majority of the breeders are in it for the money anyways. Some of them go for 5-10 grand and that's CRAZY!
dogs,fdifag2,t3_elhrl8,1578441594.0,"Eukanuba and Iams are formulated and owned by the same company and both meet WSAVA guidelines, so Eukanuba is another option you could choose from. We feed purina pro plan and purina one, but i wouldn't have an issue feeding any of the other foods.

dogs,fckyd4m,t3_eho07v,1577735832.0,"Honestly yes and no. She helps when shes cuddles up to me when I'm panicking and feeling sad, but the vet bills and some of her behavior make things worse at times. I would never get rid of her and I still love her, but please make sure you're at least financially stable and pretty mentally sound before you get a new pet."
dogs,fckxz3x,t3_ehq1nl,1577735598.0,"Fresh pet does not meet WSAVA guidelines. Due to potential issues like diet related DCM I would try to stick with a food that does meet the guidelines (Purina, Hills, Royal Canin and Eukanuba/ Iams)."
dogs,fckxpdc,t1_fckv5vl,1577735430.0,Dog food advisor is ran by a retired human dentist that has to education or background in veterinary nutrition. I would not trust his site at all.
dogs,fcis2lq,t3_ehdlpd,1577668476.0,These are treats right? They look okay from what i see on chewy! Just remember treats shouldn't make up any more than 10% of their daily calorie intake.
dogs,fbfnvqv,t3_ed4ltw,1576815431.0,"Our dog is named sadie and she weighs 32lbs. We are unsure of exact breed (we think hound/whippet mix), but I asked for an embark test for christmas!"
