AskReddit,ffv5t0e,t3_eva97w,1580256361.0,Maximum number of children.  I don't know what number.  I don't know who should decide.  I don't know who should enforce.  I don't know who should regulate and I don't know how to fund it.  What I DO know is that there is a point where a person's ability to reproduce far exceeds his/her ability to provide a bare minimum of support.

My mental analogy for my episodes like this is that I'm sitting in the back seat of a car and I'm watching me driving in the drivers seat but it's obviously not me because I'm in the back seat but it obviously IS me because I'm looking at the back of my head and my own eyes in the rear view mirror reflection and the hands on the wheel are obviously my own.  But it can't be me.  But it is.  But it's not.

It's my car, and I'm driving, but I'm kinda not driving, but I kinda am.
