NoStupidQuestions,fefi7ev,t1_feeqaiy,1579056846.0,"Excess energy as a side effect is both understandable in this context and kind of hilarious. I think usually you see things like “lethargy” or “excessive sleepiness” as a side effect of a drug, but here it’s like: I stopped smoking weed and now I just wanna DO THINGS, UGH. 

This is what I imagine, anyway. Because it amuses me. :)"
mildlyinteresting,fe6izrr,t1_fe5uxny,1578892425.0,Is that true? Made up? It’s on r/nosleep so I’m inclined to think not real but...?
Mommit,fdzxh2j,t3_enfohz,1578798180.0,"My one-year-old daughter has a sudden affinity for stuffed animals, in particular her polar bear, baby polar bear, and hedgehog (in that order; apparently they are ranked). She hugs them super tight and smiles the biggest smile. It’s so cute!"
science,fdzwggf,t1_fdzk24d,1578797453.0,"Depends on what you mean by bizarre, I think. When you consider that everything is new to a baby the first time they experience it—that kind of makes whatever the new behavior/thing is bizarre and therefore potentially funny.

My one year old laughs at stuff she’s not expecting (me popping up next to her and saying peek a boo, for example), which is more or less what humans find funny (the unexpected). And she thinks our dog is hilarious. If the dog is standing on her hind legs or carrying a toy (both unexpected behaviors in the moment), the baby thinks it’s the funniest.thing.ever. It’s pretty interesting for me to watch what my daughter laughs at—you can see how, through her eyes, things that the rest of us don’t even notice/register are new and exciting and funny."
Austin,fdoye17,t1_fdotvv9,1578615709.0,"I could see that. Every time I get on 35 I rant about who came up with this upper deck/lower deck thing and how do they lives with themselves. Traffic can be infuriating (really the lack of foresight/planning is what’s infuriating; bad traffic is the unfortunate side effect), and it’s only getting worse. :("
coolguides,fdg0lud,t1_fdfwa26,1578375710.0,"Right?! Though active decay isn’t exactly good, either. It’s less awful after that."
OldSchoolCool,fdfmy32,t3_ekyurb,1578365418.0,The child on the left looks like the boy version of me around that same age/time period. Just gonna assume the brown makes all kids in photos circa 1982 look the same. :)
Austin,fdfjury,t1_fde4r21,1578363400.0,"I think this allergy season is going to be the season that breaks me. I need to get allergy shots before I do something rash, like insist we abandon our house and just get in the car and drive until we reach somewhere without cedar. And that is where I shall start my new, cedar-free life."
