SuicideWatch,ffxng9d,t3_evsafh,1580328694.0,"Same here. I'm in the process of deleting all of my personal accounts. I don't have any pictures of myself save for when I was a child. I'm going to take that binder and burn it. I don't want to leave anything for people to remember me by, easy enough as I don't have any personally connections except for my mom. No point in leaving a note, no point in telling someone as that will only delay me. I was born in the wrong time, society today is  cold and heartless. I don't want any part of it."

SuicideWatch,ffs5bgp,t3_euxksh,1580173509.0,"I've been working a full time job for 7 years now and I'm burned out. I don't have anyone to come home to, I'm always tired, I wake up in the mornings so disappointed that I didn't die in my sleep. I'm done with it. Every day I feel like I lose a part of myself and I don't know how much longer I can do this"
SuicideWatch,ffs4ywm,t3_euxpu4,1580173260.0,I feel the same way. I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life so what's the point wageslaving for 45+ hours a week for the next 40+ years?? I don't want to be a part of this society if this is all I'll ever have.
ForeverAlone,ffakdjh,t1_ffak69u,1579737908.0,3 near death experiences so far. I wonder why I'm still here
ForeverAlone,ffajojb,t1_ffajijx,1579737409.0,That's a good way to put it. I'm in too deep now to make any substantial changes to my life
ForeverAlone,ffaj676,t1_ff9zuzq,1579737030.0,It's why I tend to stay to myself. I'm always thinking negatively and no one wants to be around that haha
ForeverAlone,ff9xflj,t3_esfce0,1579723603.0,"That advice won't work for me, I hate everyone man or woman it doesn't matter. I can't stand being in the same vicinity to most of the fuckers I deal with on a daily basis."
ForeverAlone,feky9t1,t3_epn211,1579210100.0,I'd switch places with you in a heartbeat. Even if I had to give up an arm in the process I'd still do it.
ForeverAlone,fejl3wd,t3_en37g9,1579178552.0,"The only joy I know is when I'm immersed in a game or series. I don't have any good experiences irl, I mostly try to forget."
ForeverAlone,fejkw9w,t1_fdt7bu0,1579178339.0,"Kinda pointless living like that, or at all tbh. Today's society is a cancer and I want no part of it."
SuicideWatch,fejjjt7,t3_ep5jga,1579176932.0,"Other people barely register on my radar. I go about my business not paying them any mind. Friends, family, coworkers are just backround noise. I live on autopilot waiting for the day I finally break and end my sorry excuse of a life."
ForeverAlone,fejiryo,t3_epakig,1579176061.0,An early death
ForeverAlone,fedv3kf,t1_fe4zfdv,1579020529.0,Utter nonsense. You may have deluded yourself into believing that but its just a cope
ForeverAlone,fedhydn,t3_eo5hpe,1579011991.0,Hang myself from a tree
ForeverAlone,fdqt4vz,t1_fdoypus,1578674319.0,"That's normal afaik. I can't relate to you, sorry bud."
ForeverAlone,fdqa2o5,t1_fdpyb0d,1578660776.0,I'd rather kill myself
ForeverAlone,fdkf898,t1_fdie03w,1578502606.0,Almost 26 and I'm still sex obsessed. I try not to think about it but I end up getting more depressed if I ignore it for too long
ForeverAlone,fco2bo7,t1_fcnmy02,1577822772.0,Live for another 40+ years only to regret not killing myself sooner? No thanks
SuicideWatch,fb4tsba,t3_ebgkpc,1576515380.0,There is no God. Life isn't sacred. Our existinance is meaningless
