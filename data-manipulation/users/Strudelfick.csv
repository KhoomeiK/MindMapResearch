neoconNWO,ff0fvzv,t1_ff0dmta,1579468523.0,"Addicts who commit crimes can be forced to go to treatment centers. If they don’t commit crimes, it’s immoral to take away their freedom (even though they may still hurt family and friends through their addiction without doing anything illegal). Seriously, how can anyone argue for threatening addicts with “forced treatment”? Do you really think you can force people to stop trying to do drugs, forever? Your approach is only going to make people afraid to get help voluntarily. Other than that I don’t see in what ways the state could take action against illegal drug users vs legal ones. In Portugal all drugs are decriminalized and I’ve only heard good things about it. 

I’m not arguing for making drugs easily accessible in super markets and such. There are ways to limit access, like requiring people to have a consultation session (not sure if that’s the right word, English isn’t my first language, can’t find a better translation) with a social worker before they can start buying drugs. 

Ease of access isn’t going to make that much of a difference anyways. It’s not like 20% of the population would become addicted to drugs if they were legalized. There are cases of people wanting to do drugs but not being able to get them, but they’re rare.


Maybe I completely misunderstood your point"

neoconNWO,ff09sku,t1_ff08mna,1579466691.0,"But the vast majority of people can easily do drugs already, no? Barely makes any difference wether they’re legal or not.

Limiting access to opioids helps limit the amount of people who “accidentally” start doing drugs recreationally, but people who are already doing them will just switch to Heroin because they see that Pharma opioids are becoming more expensive. 

There’s already a market for these addictive substances, it’s just a blackmarket and not a legal one. Saying “drugs are bad” is not really an argument against legalization"
