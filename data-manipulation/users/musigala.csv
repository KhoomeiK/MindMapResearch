AdviceAnimals,ffm7m79,t1_ffm5en3,1580049858.0,"That's what I was told, that I was throwing away my vote.  Well to me it was better than throwing away my integrity.  It's got to start somewhere.  And 3 million people like me voted Libertarian."
news,ffm18qv,t3_eu63z5,1580046908.0,"The guns we have are locked away in a safe.  We don't have young children anymore, but we do have grandkids now and that's where they will stay.  My husband was in the Army and is very vigilant about gun safety.  You don't play with guns, period.  They're not toys.  I'm so sick and tired of hearing about kids being shot due to something like this.  It's so sad and unnecessary."

Just a word of experience- I don't know what medications you're on, but some can cause weight gain and raise insulin resistance.

If you haven't already, check out /r/intermittentfasting .

And your reason isn't shallow, and you're being honest!"
keto,ffeyqqz,t3_et9ac7,1579870662.0,"I started back on keto early November and then started intermittent fasting a few weeks later.  For some reason, alcohol now gives me a massive headache and I don't feel good after drinking it.  I take it as a sign that I shouldn't be drinking it anymore.

I definitely agree with you- in fact before my granddaughter was born I went back and got another TDAP shot (because whooping cough).  That was three years ago, now she's expecting again so I went and got another because they only last 2-3 years."
