1200 calories on paper is probably more like 900-1000 in reality if you are exercising so essentially you are massively under eating, which isn't sustainable long term.

Even if you don't get a fitbit I'd still encourage you to eat more calories, aim for 1600-1800 and you should still lose weight without having to think about it.

I'd also recommend making sure you are protein focused, eating some form of protein at every meal and if you can snacking on protein rich foods in between meals."

I then went in with some dried moss from ebay and glued that on with pva or superglue depending on whether it needed to dry quickly (the hanging strands mainly).

I used the fallout of the bag of moss mixed with pva glue for the nooks and crannies mixed into a sort of moss paste.
