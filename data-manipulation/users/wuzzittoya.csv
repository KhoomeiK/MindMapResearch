RandomActsofCards,ffv027j,t1_ffuzurw,1580252642.0,Thank you!  I have considered attempting to auction off a painting somewhere in hopes people might be kind enough to bid one high. Planning on working on a wildlife painting - paper is already on the drafting table.

Send me a DM, mark that you are the bride because I have another one I agreed to.  Thank you!

I am going to my nephew's wedding in Houston March 7 if all goes well. I haven't seen my sister in maybe 16 years (I live in Missouri and I am poor). It is going to be over $800 to make the trip. We are discussing getting a loan."
