askscience,ffngk09,t3_eu6tfh,1580065664.0,I would love to have a kid more than anything but right now I simply cant afford it and sadly by the time I feel like I would be financially stable enough to have a child I will probably be too old to by then. It took me a long time to even get to the point where I could finally afford a home and I'm already over 40 and about 10 more years away from retirement and maybe another 5 or 6 to finally be debt free. I have to ask myself at that point in my life is it still worth it to have a child? Sadly I have to say no.

todayilearned,ff8k9l7,t3_es5vd7,1579682485.0,"Makes you wonder how many people have died simply because they where afraid of the cost of the ambulance ride to the hospital. Even I have been guilty of almost killing myself because of this fear. Few years back I had a really bad stomach virus and long story short by the time I finally couldn't take it anymore "" I still refused to call an ambulance"" I drove myself to the hospital and passed out at the reception desk from severe dehydration. Six IV's later they told me they couldn't believe I even made it there. Stupid yes. But I knew I couldn't afford the bill and obviously not thinking straight I decided that driving myself to the E.R was the best idea."

It just seems so unnecessary and cruel.  Training your dog to only feel ""safe"" in a small box just seems asinine to me. I want my dog to feel safe in my house not just a small corner of a room.
