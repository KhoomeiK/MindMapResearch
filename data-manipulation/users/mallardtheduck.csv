CrappyDesign,ffbyeub,t1_ffblees,1579786726.0,"Not really. Qwerty actually made typing faster.

Old-fashioned mechanical typewriters (usually, there were other designs, but they're less common) had letter stamps mounted on a set of levers arranged in an arc facing the paper. The arrangement of levers mirrors the layout of the keyboard to keep the mechanical complexity to a minimum and ensure keys have a consistent ""feel"" (resistance, travel distance, etc.). As, obviously, we want any letter to appear at the same spot on the paper all the levers converge at the paper; so if multiple levers are pushed forwards at the same time, they will reach a point where they'll conflict with each other. Conflicting levers will often jam, or result in one pushing the other back to the paper.

For adjacent levers, they'll conflict almost immediately, but widely-spaced levers won't conflict until much closer to the paper, so, in order to type as quickly as possible, you have to ensure that it's less common for levers close to each other (where you have to pause so that the first lever fully returns to the arc before the next can be pressed)  have to be pushed in succession. Typing is also faster when you alternate hands, since one hand can be moving to the next letter while the current letter is being pressed. These qualities are exactly what the Qwerty layout was designed to achieve."

You'd have a hard time confirming the history of the Roman Empire if that's your standard of historical evidence. Sure, you could show that similar building structures (forts, villas, temples) were built all across Europe and the Mediterranean region over a period of several hundred years, you could find identical coinage from multiple sites (Roman coins have been found as far remote from their source as Japan), potentially even do some DNA analysis of human remains to show that Italians were in high-status positions across the area... But would you be able to prove any kind of narrative context to these finds? The names and sequence of rulers? The descriptions of conquests, of specific events in the history of said empire? Without reference to handed-down ancient documentation you'd be left with little more than saying that an influential trading and cultural movement with a strong military and possibly operated by prominent Italians may have existed.

The text of the Bible/Torah are at least as reliably transmitted as any other historical documentation. The Dead Sea Scrolls place absolute upper bounds on the writing of the Torah to no later than ~300BCE and provide strong indications through context that they are much earlier. The earliest fragments of the Christian New Testament found date from no later than the early third century CE and the sheer number of early surviving copies from multiple different traditions dwarfs any other similarly dated documentation (of course, that's largely due to the influence of Christianity itself; Christians largely controlled Europe and the Levant for much of its history and were much more inclined to preserve their own texts, sometimes at the expense of other ancient writings)."

Thing is, humans don't generally require ""concrete"" evidence to believe something. There's no scientific test to prove that your parents/family/SO/etc. actually love you, but you believe it (or disbelieve it, in unfortunate cases) based on the evidence of your interactions with them, the things they say and do, etc. There are likely plenty of things that you believe based very limited evidence; a friend's recollection of events that you weren't party to, a media report that you can't personally verify, etc. but you believe these things not because they you can be repeated in a lab (they can't), but because of the strength of experience (your friend has no reason to lie, the media outlet has been trustworthy in the past, etc.) and personal judgement."

You have faith that the chair you're likely sitting on while reading this won't suddenly collapse. Based on what? Your previous experience sitting in said chair, that fact that it doesn't feel like it's falling apart, the fact that it was permitted to be sold which implies that it meets your government's safety standards, etc. Sure, you could send it off to a lab and have it structurally analysed, examined in minute detail for flaws and confirmed that it's able to hold your weight, but nobody does that and even then you're putting faith in the lab to perform the tests honestly and to a high standard.
