For me, as a passionate conservationist, I see the alarmist noise around global warming drown out other fundamental environmental issues.

Habitat destruction, illegal hunting/poaching & the illegal wildlife trade are all massive issues driving wildlife populations to the brink. They are independent of global warming - though it touches & exacerbates everything.

Just watched that episode- all those poor Indian peeps attacked by Leopards. I had no idea. Crazy.

Jaguars are significantly heavier/bigger than Leopards & also have small spots inside their markings or rosettes- which Leopards dont.
