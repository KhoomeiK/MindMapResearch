TargetedShirts,ffmr9db,t1_ffmqvot,1580058080.0,I do but it just seemed like a strange connection at the time. Maybe it would have been better if I left it out.

forza,ff9cy3u,t1_ff9cocn,1579710227.0,Guess I’ll keep checking that and hold out hope that Playground gives it to us some other way. Maybe a Trial or in the Forzathon shop someday. I’m not into painting/tuning/etc. so I won’t be able to get it from the Star Card. Oh well!
youngpeopleyoutube,ff8rji6,t1_ff7cgs0,1579693220.0,Ok this is embarrassing...I’m 25 and discovered reddit through one of those videos in 2018.

NASCAR,ff3qctg,t1_ff3pupa,1579546579.0,"The practice/qualifying sessions from NBC’s broadcasts are included. You also get the Whelen Modified races, ARCA, NASCAR’s Pintys Series, and some other short track stuff TBA. Here is a list of the ARCA streams: https://m.imgur.com/a/o8pKXsA.

NASCAR,ff3lso2,t1_ff3kh6a,1579543774.0,"I think NASCAR’s really invested at making it a step on the ladder. They are combining the K&N with the ARCA guys for the ARCA Menards Showdown, a special in-season championship too."

forza,fenvfh1,t1_fenv01q,1579291496.0,I know I’ve just never had a problem losing multiple tries in a row. Maybe I was just driving bad IDK.
