nextfuckinglevel,ffouy0e,t1_ffns7t4,1580082074.0,Your throwing knives look like kukri. How hard was it to balance that shape for throwing. I thought kukri were weighted out towards the tip to give them more chop heft.

I don't blame you for not wanting to listen that. I can't listen to him voluntarily. Being forced to listen him would be a rather hellish punishment."
cosplay,ff6i1kn,t1_ff5o959,1579627644.0,Should have known you'd notice that detail. Your sense of detail is pretty amazing. All the little details add up to an awesome cosplay though. That's why your costume is so good.

Hey it occurred to me the the Aztecs made their obsidian blades by chipping them by hand. Which leaves knapping marks from the chisel they used. If you really want to get technical about that might look better than just flat shiny enamel. I have no idea how you would do it, but just a thought."

Things like that are actually far worse, but quantification doesn't matter. It's more about the privileged attitude of humanity that leads to this behavior. We have a long long way to go."

surfing,fetryka,t1_fespcum,1579379272.0,"Almost every rule is conditional: if it's that big or breaking shallow and too hard to duck dive, nobody should be expected to hold their board. Sometimes in those conditions if you hold onto your board you're taking your life in your hands. Not a lot of fun going over the falls while trying to fend off your board."

cosplay,fenua5a,t1_femdgnb,1579290840.0,"Yeah, they are the only slightly jarring note. Sorry I picked on it like that, but it just seemed to me that the Dama would be using obsidian knives since the ancient Mesoamerican nations didn't have steel. Although I just found that the Lady Mechanika version is using a pistol so there's that. So do it like you want it, but black knives would be cool looking with the version you did :)"
