electricians,fgj6p38,t1_fgj4fvp,1580838011.0,"Yeah probably. Blue collar workers are smart. But most are not like book smart so to speak. Ok im from finland and it’s but different here. About half people go to high school (usually academically gifted) and half go to vocational (usually the ones with good hands). My class was full of hillbillies, with only few smart ones but as i said they were better with their hands. They’re all smart in their own way.  
Either way the work is ok if the objective isnt too hard for me, but  its something i dont really want to work with at least for a long time. Engineering job i feel like would fit me more.


But i know that some smart people in the states study to become plumbers etc who earn a big buck as you said. Average-wise, an engineering job straight outta gate wont pay much more than electrician job. That happens here too,  academically gifted work with trades to get a good paying job with guaranteed work unlike some college degrees. 


I definitely agree with you about learning fundamental skills that help you outside of work. The backlash trade students get (in the states) is unfair."

electricians,fgix3gl,t3_eysap6,1580832773.0,"I went to vocational college and was done in 3 years being 18 years old. I finished school with good grades but decided to work on my ability to work with hands which i was bad at in school. So the practical stuff was hard for me sometimes but the theoretic stuff was easy especially the unrelated courses. 
Went to college right after that because i feel like i am smarter than blue collar work and it would probably stress the shit out of me as just the internships gave me anxiety and shit. Hence i’m working on engineering degree now. Because i didnt go to high school math is one thing that i struggle with. I just seem to have this thing for going to places where i dont belong to. Decided to start playing american football a year ago after i lost weight two years ago while i had my first internship. I got yelled at if i did anything wrong, i developed anxiety, got sick every month for half a year, stopped gym and eating. It was great to finish that internsip.  But that’s just me. It’s an interesting field to work with, there’s always work and pay is great. Even if i study in a different field now (again making questionable decisions) electricity is something i’m interested in and at the moment actually my experience with is helping me alot with physics!
My tip is to be more interested in doing things by hands and improving the logical thinking. It wasn’t just doing a thing, sometimes you had a work you needed to do and you had to plan how to do it, instead of having the plan drawn by an engineer. Ability to improvize is important"

BlackPeopleTwitter,fgbm5gd,t1_fgbjk05,1580663616.0,"I think the goals of god are fairly known and proven because of jesus’ teachings but his means of actions are beyond our comphrehension but ultimately for the greater good. Like a kid dying horribly may be greeted by a lifetime of bliss on the other side. I do believe that things happen for a reason and for your greater good, whether it’s a lesson that needed to be learned or the situation ended up better than what it would have been without a bad thing happening first. I don’t know if it’s god or a funny coincidence that these things happen or if it’s just my judgement and philosophy of things but i dont really care.
And i guess god doesnt want his intervention to be obvious so he cant just strike a lightning at a guy mugging someone. 
And it’s possible that god indeed has no control over world today, but is just a creator of world so to speak. It’s sunday anyway"
