There must always be the counter argument that most of these animals are endangered. And whilst nature reserves in their native countries are all well and good, there will always be limited space and limited food and financial resources for the animals living in the reserve, still a risk of poachers, disease (in elephants, the biggest killer is Elephant Herpes virus, killing the wild population just as much as the zoo population), drought, famine, etc. Now think of all the zoos worldwide that have families of elephants living in them, breeding programs with pedigree records to avoid inbreeding that could weaken the population. How many thousands of elephants are in zoos worldwide, compared to the number in nature reserves?

Elephants all come from pretty hot countries, and it'd be cruel to force them to live outside, in a country they are not native to, in a climate they are not adapted to, when it's cold.

Fun historical fact: in the medieval period, the tower of london held a collection of animals that were given to the king as a gift. One gift was an African elephant. The keepers worried about keeping him warm, so gave him a gallon of wine to drink each day. He lived a short, but tipsy life.

As for the bars everywhere, elephants are very strong, you need thick bars they cannot bend or break, with gaps wide enough for a keeper to get their arms (sometimes even their whole bodies) through to feed, health check, train or medicate the elephants, but not wide enough that a rampaging elephant can get through after the keeper.

Stone walls are easy to clean, and don't require the keepers to be in the enclosure for too long. Bars on the feeder mean the elephants have to work to pull out their food, makes them think and reduces boredom."

I know I complained about 6's therapists in the last post, but I must again emphasise the fact that THEY were the professionals, and you did not fail by not questioning them. Most of us are trained from an early age that there are certain we should trust. 

Lost or in danger? Go find a policeman, he will help you, hunny!

Sick or injured? The doctors and nurses will make you better, sweetie! (Hell, why to you think Angels of Death doctors and nurses were able to go undetected for so long. Just look up Harold Shipman.)

Therapists are no exception. We trust their advice, and we rarely question it. The first therapist failed, they should have talked to 6 before making their recommendations, instead of going off of a manipulative childs fantasy drawing. And you never actually spoke to the second therapist, so what is the chance that the therapist said nothing of the sort to 6, and 6 just used it as an opportunity to get what she wanted.

Also, I would like to address the thought of suicide or just being out of the picture. You say you don't want to become an emotional burden on 1-5, in addition to everything you put them through for 6. 

What do you think suicide is? Do you really think that a huge weight will be lifted off the shoulders of 1-5 and husband, the sun will start to shine and they'll all stubble out of their houses into each others arms, hug and kiss and get along for ever more?

Just as YOU are doing some self discovery, realising your past wrongs and healing from this experience, how do you know 1-5 aren't doing the same right now, or will do, once they know that 6 is definitely gone? You committing suicide will actually ADD to their emotional burden and they will carry the guilt of their mother's suicide forever.

Thing we have to remember is Egypt was multiple tribes that became cities. Those cities joined together until you had kingdoms, Upper and Lower. Finally, around 3000BC, the kingdoms were united. 

Every tribe had their own beliefs- different gods with different names, stories and attributes- and they were merged into the gods we know today.

Births had to be witnessed by bigwigs, sometimes that meant in the room next door or in the actual room, to make sure the child in legitimate. One of the rumours spread about James II of England, when he finally got a son that it was not legitimate, famously called the Warming Pan Incident / Scandal of 1688.

Consummation of a marriage was not usually actually witnessed. The curtains of the bed would be drawn, and there may be servants or bigwigs in the room, or next door, but it was not usual it was actually *seen*. During the 'divorce' of Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon, the big question was whether her marriage to Henry's elder brother, Arthur, had ever actually been consummated. If it had, their marriage was illegal and void (her father had written to the Pope and been given a Dispensation that made the marriage legal, but the question would be if the Pope had been wrong). Katherine claimed her earlier marriage was not consummated and there was very little proof if it was or not, hence why the 'divorce' proceedings took 6 years. The best proof that it was, was that the next morning Arthur called for a mug of ale ""I am thirsty, for last night I was in the midst of Spain"" (Katherine of Aragon was a Spanish princess). But, Arthur was a 15 or 16 year old boy, boasting to other 15 - 16 year old boys, so... I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions from your own experiences of boys that age."

There is a spectrum of behaviour from helicopter parents. On the 'mild' end, they want to know and control every aspect of their childrens lives, and don't want or don't trust that their children can make adult decisions, ever. On the more severe end, they can actually refuse to allow their children to do anything without them, even going so far as to go to the after school activities to ""monitor"" their children. So, an example of the difference between a milder and more severe helicopter parent: they either demand to know EXACTLY where the child is going, exactly who their going with, exactly what they are doing, etc, and there will be hell to pay if the parent finds out the kid didn't stick to what they said or their child is rarely allowed to hang out with friends as they have homework to complete, after school activities and private lessons on weekends and holidays.

Some parents do this for genuine reasons on concern. One poster said how two older siblings died young, so their parents wrapped OP in bubble wrap so they wouldn't lose them. Some parents do this because they want their child to succeed in life, and get a high profile or well paying job (think American parents who force their sporty children to practice day after day, looking forward to the day they get a sports scholarship to college and they have already started counting out the earnings they'll get when they are signed on to a professional team).

I'm not saying he will become physically abusive, (but abuse does not have to be physical, it can easily be emotional) and it is still a pattern of behaviour that might explain the situation.

He was great at the beginning, because he needed to secure you. When you got pregnant, and it was clear that nothing was wrong and the baby was going to survive, he doesn't have to try hard anymore and he can be his real self.
