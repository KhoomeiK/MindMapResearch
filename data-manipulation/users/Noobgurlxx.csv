Pets,ffhian0,t1_ffgaamc,1579936498.0,"I live in a very cold state, in my apartment building people litteraly let their dogs out while they wait behind the door shut. It's so scary, no matter how cold it is I always walk my dog on a leash and this dogs running free without the owner in sight honestly  make me nervous. And I always have to wait longer to go back, and check from a distance till they bring them back home, all while me and my dog freeze outside. Along with that they don't even bother cleaning up after their dogs and it's just a poop camp outside the building now."
AskVet,fffribk,t1_fffl3w2,1579890222.0,Something like that happened to my dog! He got scratched in the eyeball ( in the white part thankfully) the vet gave me eye drops to put twice a day and my dog healed just fine!
aww,feadqrf,t1_feabqka,1578947406.0,The worst is that people always go for the head. They don't know that THAT is the least spot you wanna touch in a dog!
aww,feadg98,t1_feablyc,1578947301.0,My cav hates kids as well!!
aww,fea8qem,t1_fea777z,1578945693.0,"Same here, I have a super cute cavalier king who doesn't like to be pet by strangers. Everytime I have to tell people not to pet him, not because he is aggresive, he is just not comfortable with strangers touching him, no matter how adorable he looks!
It's funny how we wanna pet every animal but if humans touched us as often as we touch dogs we would be enraged!"
