woodworking,ff3z2lm,t1_ff34eqv,1579551987.0,Congrats! Fun boats to sail. Lovely wood - takes a lot of elbow grease to rehab it.
CozyPlaces,ff0b78u,t1_ff0a6gn,1579467119.0,Haha yeah. Roomier and better water pressure/more hot water! At least if you’re lucky in your gym!
CozyPlaces,ff0883q,t1_fezzba9,1579466210.0,I live on a boat and have a gym membership for the shower like the comment below said. There’s a toilet system like in an RV that you pump out periodically. Boats smaller or differently arranged than mine might have composting toilets or simple bucket type systems. I imagine that kind of thing could work for a van. But you’d want a way to dispose of it everyday.
