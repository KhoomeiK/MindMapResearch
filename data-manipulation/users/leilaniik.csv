piercing,feqnw4w,t1_fepe136,1579344116.0,"I personally suggest going to a good piercer and letting them see the problem, I'm sure they will change the hoop with a stud, keeping it in would only make things worse."

Anxiety,fenb7wu,t3_epqv6n,1579280959.0,"I'm proud of you. You were very brave for going to that interview.

My heart goes out to you and I really hope things will get better once you get treatment. Just know that you're not alone in this. I always used to fake being sick to get out of school presentations, I've also quit college in the first week because of my anxiety and I can't even make a phone call without getting a panic attack.

I don't know how much it will help because I know it's not that easy to do but my psychologist told me to do small things that cause me anxiety and slowly increase the difficulty, maybe it could work for you? 

Also, do you like teaching? It seems like you're in a bad spot because even if you get hired, it looks like you'll still struggle. The first step is always hard to do, but, as time goes by, hopefully you'll get more used to it and it'll help you become more social, even if it will be hard."
