First thing that comes to mind is the Naval Surface Warfare Center across the river thats up to something. Another possibility is something from Janella Research Center but that is clear out in Ashburn so seems a lot less likely.

Certain companies/agencies can get approval from the FAA to use UAS/UAV's within the restricted airspace of the DC region. However according to the rules for it, these flights are not to exceed more then 2 hours and they have to register the flight plan with the FAA. They are pretty strict on sticking to whats approved because if not that can faces fines or lose the ability to fly within that airspace. 

This kinda stuff is very fascinating to me so I am curious if you can provide any other details or possibly record video that would be great."
