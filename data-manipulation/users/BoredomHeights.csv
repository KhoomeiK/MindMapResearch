For example someone who's not rich and is struggling to get by but has an income and is marrying someone who doesn't work or makes a lot less... that's not going to help things. 

The starting over in a new city one is really situational too. This post is basically saying you have no safety net, so why does the city matter that much? I don't think any of these are that great of examples, other than maybe the quitting your job one, except that life in general is just easier with money."

AmItheAsshole,fdjn4b1,t3_elpmrd,1578478950.0,"Yes, occasionally I'll literally just go through the top posts and try to guess if OP is NTA/TA just from the title. It's usually obvious, and it's usually NTA or NAH. Even in cases where it's not obvious from the title it's usually NTA. I feel like I see something like 5% or less of posts actually end up with a YTA verdict, the sub's way too loose about what constitutes a validation post.

edit: For example, top posts right now:

-AITA for not bringing homemade treats (NTA)

-Update about NTA post about xmas gifts

-AITA for telling sister she can't have nephew call her mom (NTA)

-AITA for making gf homeless after yelling at brother (NTA)

-AITA for not wanting to give son name of dead child (NTA)

-AITA for wanting to give my baby up for adoption (NTA)

-AITA for not wanting my fiancee to strip at bachelor party (NTA)

-AITA, Disneyland, some kids going (NTA)

-AITA for not serving a man with a swastika tattoo (NTA)

Seriously, these just happen to be the top posts right now. I do see some that are probably YTA farther down, but what's the point on this sub if you have to read through 10 very obvious NTA posts to get to a trickier situation.

But for me personally games that I still play years later are pretty rare. So basically my advice would be to take it on a game by game basis and don't worry about building up your library as much as what you want to play the game on now.
