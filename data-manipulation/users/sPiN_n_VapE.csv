Edit: from a pro pitbull site :
""Well-meaning pro-pitbull advocates once circulated a myth that Staffordshire terriers were used as nanny dogs in 19th century England. While pitbull-type dogs have been enjoyed by families for generations in both English and United States history, there’s no evidence that they actually cared for children like nannies.

There’s no such thing as a nanny dog.

No dog should be unattended with small children, or expected to tolerate tail-pulling, ear-grabbing and other abuse from toddlers. 

Pitbulls are known to love their family members of all ages, but only with supervision and training"""

They are inherently aggressive. I'm not saying you can't train them to be good, but they are not suitable as pets or great with kids. Every owner says that until a toddler dies"
