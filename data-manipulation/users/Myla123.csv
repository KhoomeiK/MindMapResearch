afkarena,ffffon2,t1_ffffeih,1579882947.0,True. There are a few rich kids out there. I really don’t think the big whales are spending money they don’t have. I once played a game with a whale I got to know and it just didn’t matter at all how much he spent. And he took great pleasure in being “the best”.

If someone earns $1000 per hour and wanna spend $100 dollars a month on a daily entertainment then that is their choice and it’s not a lot for them. People wasting money on cigarettes is more crazy imo."

If it’s 1,3 CAD per pack, that would be 15,6 CAD for 360 astrobells. Then you could buy the 320 astrobell pack, and it would be a little cheaper than the 140 CAD pack ;)"
papillon,ff76j3p,t1_ff73ukv,1579642098.0,"If you are going to do it anyways, early might be beneficial. I don’t know, but it seems logical to me that the bad side effects might not occur if the body never got used to testosterone to begin with. So doing before “puberty” might be the better way, but I don’t know if that is true. Maybe you should check out why you were recommended to do it so early? 

To be honest, having a male dog with a sexual appetite can be really annoying. Since we don’t neuter usually in my country, the city is full off female dogs which go through their natural cycle, so there is always at least one female in the neighborhood with their “time of the year”. So having a male dog could be very challenging. Even when they don’t meet the other dog, just smelling their urine can effect how they behave. 

But nothing in life is all good, even roses have thorns."

So in someway I agree with you, because I’m lazy. But at the same time, it isn’t that bad now and I shouldn’t be so lazy."
papillon,ff72onb,t3_erwrx0,1579639916.0,"I live in a country where we don’t neuter by default, there has to be a reason to do it, such as behavioral issues. I had to neuter my male pap at the age of 10,5 years because he got urinary stone which is likely connected to testosterone. Only behavioral change: he doesn’t want to hump his toys anymore, but he marks as much as earlier. Also don’t get crazy when he sees a female. The down side is that he now puts on weight just by looking at food and at the same time got an increased appetite. It’s painful to tell him “no” when he is hungry all the time, and we are trying hard to make him loose about a pound. I wish we haven’t had to neuter him, because the bad sides sucks and unless there is a good reason, the balls isn’t that much of a problem."
MedicalPhysics,ff7222y,t3_ertax0,1579639562.0,"A lot of medical physicists work with imaging, not just RT. I doubt a cure for cancer will end the use of CT, MRI and nuclear medicine. Yes, we scan a lot of cancer patients, but we also have a lot of other patients.  Also, new challenges will rise and physicists can be versatile."
afkarena,ff2ebi6,t1_ff2a421,1579502616.0,"The point of my comment was wether to spend any amount of money vs F2P. Everyone is free to decide for themselves what they think it’s worth. Personally I like to compare how much I spend to how much I would give for something else in life that would only give me joy for a short amount of time like going to the movies or having a drink at a bar. Buying a chocolate is in my opinion a bigger waste of money than buying a 2 euro-something in a game I enjoy. The chocolate will last shorter and I will have to exercise afterwards. 
I would say paying 4 times the price to fly first class on a 4 hour flight is truly a waste of money. After 4 hours all that extra you paid for is gone!! But some people can so easily afford it that it doesn’t matter. It all depends on a person’s economy. 

And when it comes to helping the world, paying someone for a job they do so they get to have a job is helping the world if you think of the people living in it. Creating jobs is important. If you think of the environment, making people rich is bad because rich people tend to “use” more CO2, but on the other hand, spending your money on bits has a lower carbon footprints than a lot of other stuff you could have bought. 

Games with micro transactions works so some people can play for free because some people spend so much money that the developers earn a lot anyways if it’s popular enough. The point of my comment was to point out that choosing to pay for a product you use shouldn’t have the stigma it has."

afkarena,ff0wgka,t1_ff0auoo,1579472925.0,"It isn’t really “wasting money” if you pay people for the work they do that entertain you. Expecting people to work for free for your amusement is kinda mean. I respect people who don’t want to spend money on it, but I wish people could understand that making games like these are a full time job. It works out because some people pay for the rest, so these type of games earn plenty. But it’s weird how it frowned up on to pay for mobile games but not computer games.

infj,feooouq,t3_epzdrj,1579303183.0,"I’ve come to realize that no one are just one thing. Being like you describe in interviews are typical INFJ, so you are not a fraud!! Stop thinking that, I truly believe that’s the most likely side you will show when you get the job.

I’m also the way you described but it didn’t stop after I got the job. I always turn “on” for work, meetings and so on, and afterwards I get tired, and after some time like this I get sick. My advice is to try to find a sustainable energy level at work. That’s now one of my goals for 2020. Working from home now and then helps because then I can have resting INFJ-face all day. 

Good luck with your job-hunting!"
teslamotors,fe6srdo,t1_fe5d9w8,1578903667.0,"That I can’t imagine it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist, but I’m gonna elaborate some more. What others have commented is also true. Even such things as what temperature you have in the car will be saved to a profile.

But sharing a Tesla is like sharing a great dessert at a 5* restaurant. It’s lovely to share something great with someone you love. You also get to share the location of the car in the app. So if one is working late the spouse can see in the app how far the other one is from home when driving home and the one that’s home can prepare dinner for the one who worked late that’s ready when they get home. You don’t have to communicate all the boring stuff like “when will you be home/are you home soon?”. You also get to impress your cat or dog with the exact knowledge of when the other person will be home. I’m sure our dog thinks we are so cool because we know that. You also get to share the joy of free ota updates. “The car has learned this and that” and you can enjoy that together. When you schedule a service appointment in the app, both will see it in the app and you don’t have to remember to share that info. You also unlock the Tesla-conversation topic which is a really interesting topic. And I almost forgot, you also get to pick a name for your car together. And not just a name that you call it, but a name that will be in the car and in the app. I loved it when we were waiting to get the S and discussed different names. It was like waiting on a pet."
teslamotors,fe3ji82,t3_enpfe1,1578849794.0,"Actually Tesla is a great car for sharing because you can make individual profiles in the car. It will automatically change the seat and mirrors etc to how you prefer it when you drive the car, and the same for your wife. Also goes for different settings such as full regeneration or not. Me and my SO share two Teslas, even tho he usually drives the 3 and I usually drive the S. We both have the app on our phones but we share one profile which works fine, that doesn’t matter. For the model 3 you set up each phone as a key and connect each phone as a key to each profile. For the S we have a key fob each. We both have both cars in the app but the app will open up on the car you last looked at in the app, so for me the S is default in the app and for him 3 is. 

I can’t imagine a better car to share with someone else than a Tesla."
