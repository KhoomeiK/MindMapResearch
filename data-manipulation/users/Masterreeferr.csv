AskReddit,feg0fq5,t1_fed1a39,1579071660.0,It's just the culture. They saw him as a liability. Personally I disagree because I understand his situation but with older generation parents they simply could not tolerate it.
AskReddit,feg04os,t1_fecy3yn,1579071311.0,"I don't think you have to worry too much friend. My parents were mostly absent for most of my sibling's and my own life. They were both so caught up in working 24/7 their only time with us was for fun and to enjoy each other's company. I love them dearly but they never really taught us any life lessons or instilled any kind of discipline or critical thinking in us. We all had to figure that kind of stuff out on our own and it was a long and painful path for us. 3 out of 4 of us turned out perfectly fine, it was just their eldest child (my older brother) who struggled so badly he ruined his life over stupid unintentional decisions. As long as you put in any kind of effort towards being a parent and genuinely care about your kid's mindset throughout life you'll almost certainly be more than fine."
AskReddit,fefzhii,t1_fecuz15,1579070584.0,"He just wasn't thinking about it. Two key rules to going to college while under parole was that he had to get permission for any ""social gatherings"" or events from the parole officer first, and that he had to disclose anyone he was in contact with. He got tired of being stuck in his dorm room 24/7 while everyone around him was partying so he went to party without permission. And when he met the girl he just assumed she was a fellow student so he told his parole officer that he was talking to her but lied about how he met her. He said he met her in class instead of admitting that he went to a party. Turns out the girl wasn't a college student but was a 17 year old highschool senior so the second the parole officer found that out he sent my brother off to a judge to make the final decision and the judge just didn't give af and threw him in jail for 8 years over his parole violations. I don't think he deserved to have his life taken away like that but at the same time I can agree I would have been a lot more careful and paranoid than he was. Either way he had his life ruined in the blink of an eye over some dumb shit."
AskReddit,fefyqmp,t1_fecxrju,1579069772.0,He didn't. The problem was that because he went to college while on parole he had to get permission from his parole officer before going to any kind of social gathering or event. But after a few months of putting up with getting told no to everything he got sick of seeing everyone around him going around partying and socializing so he (like a dumbass) decided to sneak out to a party one night. When he met the girl there he just assumed she was another student at the college so he thought it was okay. But obviously he didn't want to admit that he snuck out to a party so he lied to his parole officer and said that he met her in class. But the parole officer did a little sleuthing (as their job requires I'm sure) and found out that she was in fact not another college student but a 17 year old in her senior year of highschool. So my brother got busted for both lying about how he met her and also being in contact with a girl who was not 18 yet so he got sent off to a judge who felt no sympathy over the situation and sentenced him to 8 more years. He's a fucking idiot for sure but I don't think he had a single intention of violating his parole. He was ready to put all that shit behind him and just get on with his life and then he fucked it all up over a stupid decision to go party and started talking to a random girl he thought was a college student but wasn't.
AskReddit,fecs1to,t1_fecb4k1,1578982437.0,"Pretty similar to what happened to my older brother. He started sleeping with his ex's younger sister who was 16 when my brother was 20. His ex reported him to the cops. Got off pretty light surprisingly, only served about a year in prison and then was let out on parole. Part of which was that he wasn't allowed to have any contact with anyone under 18. After he got out he went to college, met a 17 year old girl at a party and started talking to her on social media. Got caught by his parole officer and got thrown back in prison for an 8 year sentence. He got out just last year but his life is pretty much fucked. Our parents pretty much disowned him, refused to pay for him to go back to school, he struggled to find employment, and got caught up with the wrong group of people. Last I heard he's a drug addict living on the streets of California."

That shit is rough and tastes like ass. If you just take an extra 5-10 minutes to get the resin out first by heating up the bowl like a crack pipe (put the lighter underneath and let it heat up the glass) and then use a paperclip or something similar to scrape it off both inside and outside; then pack a bowl of resin and smoke it the same way you'd smoke weed it pretty much removes the whole painful/harsh aspect of smoking resin. It'll still taste bad but you get perfectly normal hits that don't wreak havoc on your throat and lungs.

You seem to forget that a massive part of zoos existence in modern times is to educate and inform the public. And more often than not large amounts of the money generated by zoos gets donated to conservation efforts. It's not like they're just a bunch of animals locked up in a box so some rich guy can line his pockets (at least not in 1st world zoos.) Zoos are full of rescued animals that would never survive in the wild who's lives are then used as a means to educate the public and by selling tickets to see the animals the money generated goes to protecting those animals and their environments in the wild. And those rescued animals procreate as all animals do but because we can't just tear their babies away from them and throw them out in the wild instead the bloodline continues as a family that while they may never see the wild, they live extremely comfortable and safe lives that generates money which goes towards helping their wild counterparts and their homes."

interestingasfuck,fe3xg1u,t1_fe34wly,1578853748.0,Anywhere else in it's environment that it wants? Animals in zoos see hundreds of people a day and most of the time they do not care and do not pay much attention. And even when they do it's just for a brief moment of time before they go back to doing whatever they want. Usually playing with each other or running around for fun or simply relaxing in a stress free and safe environment. To sit and watch a baby for half an hour is pretty remarkable.

If we lived side by side with other primates they'd be ripping our limbs off and beating us with them, tearing our faces off and eating them. Primates are extremely aggressive and violent in the wild. A zoo is the only thing that keeps them docile and the glass between us is the only thing that keeps us safe. There are many parts of the world where smaller monkeys *do* live side by side with humans, you can see them walking around sidewalks and interacting with tourists on a daily basis. And guess what? They love to steal things like backpacks, cellphones, cameras, etc. and run off with them. They constantly attack people (especially females) by biting people and pulling on people's hair and hitting people. If they were orangutans or chimpanzees or any of the larger types of primates they would be straight up murdering people on a daily basis. They would not care about your silly little magic tricks. They would not have the attention span for it and all they would want is to take something from you or attack you. There is no living side by side with them. They are wild animals.

Anyone who speaks out against it or doesn't play along gets shunned by their peers and shunned by the system in general. There's simply no place for good cops.

He gave tax breaks to the rich who already evade most of their taxes anyway using legal loopholes and even if they didn't the wealth inequality in this country is so bad the last thing rich people need is tax cuts.

There's a reason all big chain stores across America have very strict rules when it comes to loss prevention. Even the simple act of refusing to let someone leave the building without showing a receipt can turn into a massive lawsuit for illegally detaining someone and holding them against their will. If an employee wants to claim they had ""reasonable suspicion"" for detaining someone they need to actually have a legitimate reason they can testify in court, just saying they were suspicious alone is not going to hold up. Neither is claiming that the customer refused to show a receipt because people are under no legal obligation to do so. The employee is going to need an actual legitimate reason they can testify to. Otherwise whoever they were detaining and holding against that person's will can sue the company for a pretty large sum of money.

He does it subtly (or not so subtly) by making strategic decisions to undermine opponents and creates opportunities that he can take advantage of. Unlike Trump who is more of a void of critical thinking and long term decision making and prefers to just use brute force to get immediate results no matter what the consequences are.

Second of all, one of the only reasons humans are capable of technology is because we're capable of language both written and spoken. There are multiple cases of other primates using spears and other built tools that they use to their advantage but it never really goes anywhere because the methods are not passed on from generation to generation through language. If primates, or literally any species really, was capable of passing on information to newer generations through speech and written language then you'd probably see all of them making leaps and bounds in advancement. But that is exactly what separates humans from everyone else. We can pass on information from generation to generation in ways much more extreme and complex than any other species on the planet."

A huge majority of humanity's greatest technologies and achievements were born out of war and the military industrial complex. Even things that were created outside of war almost always end up becoming exponentially better and more advanced in short periods of time the moment they have any kind of use in a war setting. NASA has been under funded and slow to make progress for decades. The second the military gets involved with anything space related you can be damn sure progress is going to happen much much more quickly. Maybe not in the public eye, or at least the most advanced things won't be in the public's eye, but new capabilities will probably start popping up left and right once the military is involved."

Asking for the most recent picture on someone's phone isn't usually a dirty question it's just a fun conversation starter. So that alone kinda makes her a hoe if her most recent picture was of her cleavage (what are the chances of that) or she was being dishonest and sent that on purpose even though it's not what he asked for. Then she asks for a dick pic and when she gets it she ghosts him. If that's not a hoe I don't know what is.

He was the psychologist behind all of it. He came up with the idea that if propaganda worked in times of war, it could work in times of peace too. So instead of pro-war propaganda, he came up with advertisements. Before he came into the picture advertising wasn't really that big of a thing and no one really did it. But he got news papers and radio stations and television stations to start pushing peace time propaganda, aka advertisements that would keep people focused on material things instead of being focused on the government and the world at large.

Edit: The documentary is called The century of self. It's extremely informative and covers everything I talked about. I highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in this kind of stuff and why humanity/society functions the way it does."

That is exactly the point. After WWII America spent tens of millions of dollars researching human psychology and how to best control a massive population to prevent any kind of dissent or revolution or anything of the sort. And they found that the best way to do it was to just flood the masses with distractions like material goods and entertainment. It keeps everyone apathetic because no matter how bad the world gets and how shitty everything is in reality, no one cares as long as they live in their little ""happiness bubble"". That is the exact term they used for it. They figured out how to trap people in ""happiness bubbles"" and it lets them get away with pretty much anything because the masses are living in their own little worlds and do not care about anything. At least not enough to actually take any action because then they risk losing their happiness bubble and no one wants that. So they just sit idly by as the world goes round."

Even if he's mostly looking at the pictures/videos the conversation between the two of you is also a huge part of it. Pretty sure that's the most unethical thing about the entire situation. It's not like the girl's content you're stealing is missing out on any revenue because the chances of the guy you're scamming finding her real details are slim to none. The truly unethical and fucked up part is tricking a guy into thinking you're a girl so you can take his money. Pretending to be a member of the opposite sex and having someone jerking off to the idea of you when you're really a dude just sending random nudes is easily the worst part.
