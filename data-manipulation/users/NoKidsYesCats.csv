* Just put them on it and hope they sit still. Results vary, chill cats are more likely to stay seated.

* Put them on it with some treats and note their weight when they're eating the treats. 

* Does your cat love boxes? Put a box on the scale, turn it on so it doesn't count the weight of the box and then put the cat in the box.

* Put the scale up high like on the kitchen counter, put cat on the scale and kinda encircle them with your arms (without touching) so they can't get away. Work fast!"

2. If there was a cover up to avoid blowback over those 3 points, why did they immediately admit them to the police? Wouldn't make sense. They could've left the encounter by the gate unsaid and nobody would be any wiser.

CatAdvice,ffavfvm,t3_eslo7k,1579745411.0,"Oh boy, you're literally describing the exact same situation I went through with my boys. He did and does have kitty litter box PTSD. 

What happens is that your cat has associated the litter box with BAD THINGS (aka being attacked), and that association sticks around even after the actual Bad Thing is over now. 

What you'll need to do is make a positive reassociation with kitty and the litter box. This will not be easy, and the approach is different for every cat. What's your cat's biggest motivator? Treats? Play? Praise and affection? 

**You'll also need to get rid of the tops of the litter boxes entirely.** Not being able to see that there's no threat is a very big trigger. My cat would rather go in the carrier than in a litter box with a top, and that's saying something. Start with this, literally just go and remove the tops right now. That 80/20% is actually a very good thing, she's not that severe yet. Removing the tops may fix it entirely, if not read on.

Then you'll need to put her down in the litter box several times a day, as much as you can with your schedule but not more than once an hour or so. Gently pick her up and put her down in the litter box, giving her plenty of treats or whatever motivates her. Don't worry about getting her to actually do anything there yet, that should come naturally as she starts to view it as a positive space again.

Let me know if you have any questions!"
CatAdvice,ffaube9,t1_ffaevh1,1579744663.0,"Some cats unfortunately just don't like being brushed. They'll tolerate it for some time depending on the individual, but most won't allow you to peacefully work out knots without protesting- and for good reason, since they usually hurt. But with long haired breeds, you just need to force it even if they don't like it, since knots will form, which hurt to work out, and if left alone will become bigger and bigger until it can actually damage the skin and cause big wounds. 

So those knots need to come other ASAP, they'll only get bigger and harder to remove. You can shave them out if you don't mind the look, some cats prefer this because it doesn't hurt like brushing them out would. 

You know your cat best, do you feel like she's actually progressing in allowing more brushing, or is she still stuck on her baseline?"

CatAdvice,ff81y1c,t1_ff7yac6,1579663859.0,"Are the strays friendly or feral? If they're feral, TNR is the only way, unless you want them euthanized... If they're friendly, maybe a shelter or rescue would take them in so they can adopt them out to new owners? 

If they're ferals and you decide to try to go the TNR route, I've found that a lot of shelters/rescues are willing to go the extra mile to help with this, possibly even picking them up once they're caught. I know my shelter does it because they drop off the trap and pick it up again when a feral has gone in. Then they take them to a vet, get them fixed and drop them off again at the pick up location once they're properly awake.

I understand you'd like to get them gone completely, but that is an extremely unlikely scenario. Apparently your neighbourhood is a good spot for cats, especially with the neighbour feeding them, and if you kill or relocate the current cats, other ones will come and fill their places. By doing TNR, you're 1. reducing the impact of the cats by taking away their drive to mate and 2.  preventing other (unfixed) cats from coming into the neighbourhood (their territory) and breeding more kittens. Because of this you'll have a relatively stable cat population with decreased levels of destruction that will drive off other unfixed cats."

Not that crazy to me. They were tired from the Christmas party, the house was huge with a weird layout. Highly likely they slept through the entire thing. And the police allowed friends and family to come over and clean the house, didn't even search it, didn't secure it as a crime scene, let the family carry her body upstairs, etc. They were woefully unprepared for a case of such significance and fucked it up to the point where we'll likely never know who it was. I firmly believe that there was plenty of evidence (DNA, fingerprints) available, they just didn't secure it."

Treat if you can, euthanize if you absolutely can't."" Although I do feel that a person that can't provide the basic necessities I mentioned above shouldn't adopt a pet. 

Where I live, pets don't get euthanized simply for existing/not getting adopted fast enough. So that probably influences my viewpoint; in a kill shelter, it may result in a choice between a poor owner or euthanasia, while in our shelter, pets can stay as long needed until they find a good home."

ChoosingBeggars,fdm5043,t1_fdm2tpq,1578539939.0,"Did you think I was talking about putting down pets for having a runny nose? The suffering I'm talking about isn't ""pets that live a normal life"", it's them living in agony until they die of their own accord. 

The things I mentioned may seem like extremes to you, but besides the broken bones, they are extremely common pet ailments, and what they'll eventually result in after letting them go untreated. 

Pretty much all dogs and cats need dental care at some point in their lives. Blockages, both urinary and digestive, happen a lot, and there are a lot of owners who can't afford surgery but choose to take the pet home with them anyways in the hopes that they'll somehow be fine. Old age comes with many ailments, and owners are often blind to the suffering this brings to their pets. 

I'm not saying to euthanize every pet that comes in with a problem that the owner can't or won't treat, but if that problem causes real suffering and you're unwilling or unable to fix it, it's selfish and cruel to keep them alive for your own wants."

Even just old age, where a well meaning but oblivious owner can't handle saying goodbye to a pet that is obviously suffering. Death is kinder than suffering without end."

Meanwhile at a human hospital, the CT scan machine gets used multiple times a day."
