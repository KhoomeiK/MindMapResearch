dating_advice,fdi0aib,t1_fdhyg25,1578433432.0,"Well, context is important here. Did you ask to hear about her deal breakers? If she just started rattling them off without a prompt then yes that's kind of odd and does come off a bit haughty but if you were on the topic of qualities you're looking for, you can't really blame her.

And again, I'm really not trying to be mean but I just genuinely don't think her list comes even close to describing a perfect person. 
You're absolutely right though, it is subjective. Just because she doesn't think someone meets her criteria doesn't mean that person is a bad person. It just means they're incompatible, and that's a-okay!"
dating_advice,fdhgwsn,t3_eleudn,1578422399.0,"Hey man, I'm not trying to be a dick but this list seems very reasonable. If she's looking for her future spouse, why should she settle? And even if she was settling, it's honestly not hard to come by someone who meets the majority of this criteria.

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with you for not meeting these qualifications, especially if it's about mental stability, because that's a tough one for a lot of people. However, the personality traits she listed (excluding funny) are all things that any decent person should have.

Kids are a deal-breaker for most people, especially those in their 20s.

Good in bed is really just about communication. There's no such thing as ""good in bed"", but rather ""compatible in bed"" which means ask what she likes and take instruction. As long as you're not a selfish lover, that shouldn't be an issue.

You say your must haves are physically and mentally attracted to, but mental attraction probably encompasses a lot of the traits she listed. There's no way you're going to be mentally attracted to a piece of shit who lies, cheats, and tells you to suck it up whenever you need a shoulder to cry on. It's pretty much one and the same.

I wouldn't overthink this, if you two have been talking for some time then probably thinks you meet these criteria even if you don't necessarily think you do."

What if she straight up never drank again? She expressed her apologies, was sincere about it, and realized she needs to get her shit together and stop drinking?
