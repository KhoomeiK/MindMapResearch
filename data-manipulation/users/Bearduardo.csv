I get to camp way earlier than the passenger boats and I always spend some time smoking a joint and doing a police call of the camp area with my dog to pick up any trash left behind by other trips. Im constantly  amazed by the amount and variety of things I find (lots of shitty drawers, a deflated blow up doll, etc) I always try to impress upon our clients the principles of Leave No Trace camping and have everyone do a walk-through of camp before we push off in the morning."

I learned to waterski and kneeboard wearing pantyhose bottoms and pantyhose sleeves on my arms to keep from getting stung. Slathering up with vaseline helped short term too.

If some sort of civil war started, and the US Military was somehow used on the American people, I think a lot of service members would refuse orders to march on citizens and probably would end up going AWOL. They have families out there too. I think the amount of service members that would refuse orders or simply desert their posts would basically cripple the military. Not just pilots and grunts but the support men and women too. Birds cant fly if you dont have the pilots or the people to keep them in the air. I spent 4 years in the Marines as a maintainer in the airwing, and the topic of firing on regular citizens came up more than once."

I have spent lots of time boating and backpacking in the American West and Southwest where the flash floods arent water, but moving walls of rock, mud and entire trees.

The land used to burn almost every year, and if it didnt, the natives would burn it. It kept fuel loads down and eradicated any non native species.

Now every time a fire pops up they rush to extinguish it, and its lead to an infestation of invasive plants and fires that are getting progressively worse.  Land mismanagement at its finest."

I love pens, Im a river guide in a legal state and theyre perfect for ducking behind a tree or a rock on a multi day trip and getting a fat rip in without anyone smelling weed. Sometimes we get clients that like to party and bring their own weed (and other party favors), and I can pretty openly smoke green, but the pens are the best for when Im around some Mormon family that considers even coffee a drug.

MorbidReality,fcp0lst,t1_fco9kn0,1577846829.0,"Yea you want to get the victim in a rear hold. If youre tethered to a safety line, having your back upstream can create a little airpocket to catch some breaths when the line goes taught and water rushes over the back of your head, if youre not tethered and need to swim them back to shore or safety yourself, its the easiest way to swim while carrying someone. Back/side stroke with one arm and the other holding the victim. They used to say that if the person was really panicking, to try and hit them hard enough to knock them out because its easier to deal with a limp body than it is to deal with a struggling one. But its really hard to hit someone that hard while youre floating in the water so thats sort of gone by the wayside in more recent years. Happy New Year!"

Rivers dont give a fuck how good of a swimmer you are.  And a contact rescue (physically making contact with the victim) is almost always a last resort as its the most dangerous type of swiftwater rescue. Theres also that whole panicking victim thing. If youve initiated a contact rescue, by the time you get to the victim most of the time theyre in full on panic mode, trying to climb on top of anything they can to get out of the water.
