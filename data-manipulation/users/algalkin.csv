Battletechgame,ffd367o,t3_esyb97,1579812509.0,Atlas is the only one I found so far that can carry three kinds of weapons and rock em solidly while simultaniously being a front line for you.
Battletechgame,ffd2t1g,t1_ffd0uea,1579812300.0,Cat with 3 lrms or Highlander with 4 lrms can fit up to 720 ammo in them so you basically would not run out in almost any mission.

starwarsrebels,ff46hw6,t1_ff458wu,1579556606.0,"To me Sabine had Boba Fett effect. She was mysterious like him and that was fun part. Once they introduced this whole - oh she ran away from parents, oh she built weapons for Empire (wut? At age 12?), she kinda became a boring cliche. 
Im greatful there is no Boba Fett movie, they would turn him into another overexplained ""bad but noble"" bounty hunter guy. I like him to stay mysterious. Some stones should be left unturned."
diablo3,ff3svge,t1_ff2z09v,1579548123.0,First two characters - yes. Now I cant even play softcore anymore. The thought that there is nothing dangerous in this game kills all the fun.
starwarsrebels,ff3sako,t3_er0llz,1579547767.0,"Probably not a popular opinion but to me all the mandalorian arcs were kinda weak and boring. In my opinion, they should've kept Sabine as a mandalorian outcast and didnt dig deeper. 
I also think the Rebels has a lot more deeper stories and overall arcs than recent Mandalorian show. I watched them back to back and the Rebels standing out like way more developed story and characters."
