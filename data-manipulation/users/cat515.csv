puppy101,fdh0m4l,t3_el7b95,1578412773.0,I usually do some intense running with my puppy for 15-20 mins and then bring her back to the playpen to play by herself. I turn on piano music and eventually she falls asleep
corgi,fdb2drc,t3_ekfk0o,1578252969.0,How cuteeee!!
Coachella,fcuhkds,t3_eizgma,1577981127.0,"WOO, I use to be really into kpop when I was younger and I was a huge big bang fan especially TOP and Taeyang!! I don’t really listen to the newer kpop groups so this is a win for me. Definitely attracting an older crowd. Gonna be a good throwback"
corgi,fcu9bbc,t1_fctxql6,1577975606.0,She’s the sweetest!
corgi,fcu9977,t1_fcty6et,1577975572.0,Thanks!! If only Toto knew her name haha
corgi,fcu968w,t1_fctfg1k,1577975523.0,"She’s precious, I definitely would too"
corgi,fcu8vkz,t1_fctzkew,1577975323.0,She got lots of cuddles and toys!! We had a long car ride with her back so she was exhausted all day. She’s really good at communicating to me if she wants to cuddle. She just absolutely loves the corgi plushie. She plays with it and then cuddles with it at night
corgi,fcu8h56,t1_fcu3jnw,1577975039.0,I got a tip from my breeder to play music so I’ve been playing Yiruma in the background and she loves it so much and this helps her pass out. Toto sends you love back!!
Coachella,fc5x0x2,t3_eg8hfw,1577467678.0,Ugh I would absolutely cry tears of happiness if this is true but let me not get my hopes up
