Even growing up painfully shy i would still give a lil hello, wave, or smile something of acknowledgement if at a close enough distance and see them and they see you. And let stuff go and avoid fighting or when you do stand up dont be aggressive. Know the type of person basically and what best way would be about handling it but keeping the peace. And its actually good to be on good with somewhat relationship like casual friends. Because they'll look out for you and your house. But be a dick and no one cares if you're being robbed or any sort of bad luck"

entitledparents,ffjs85s,t3_etsj83,1580005534.0,You should try the many mental health threads of reddit. Many would be able better to help and some even dealing with same conditions themselves and help you and be someone you can talk and open up to. There's probably threads for your conditions you can try for better results and people on it
entitledparents,ffjrtak,t3_etw0lc,1580005226.0,"Can't she just text and you text back when you're not busy. But she causing you issues and at your work, and you're a doctor!  It can be making you look unprofessional and distracted(not good for a doctor) to your co-workers, patients, and bosses. You gotta just do tough love and not respond to her during work. Turn on airplane mode or turn off and leave in locker or something at work. This could get you in trouble with your job or looked down on thinking you're always on and using your phone while on the job. Family counseling could help like her realize when shes over doing it and extreme and set boundries for a better and healthier relationship. Does she have friends that she talks to and goes out to do stuff with? Maybe more of a social life could help and take some attention off you"
entitledparents,ffjmvr6,t3_etule2,1580001927.0,"Did no one say anything to her about or the problems it caused at all? Like half of the people left, we can't eat so that there's food for the extra people. That wasn't half a hour? How was people's reaction to her during and after that?"
entitledparents,ffji1ln,t1_ffhnvwk,1579998663.0,Yeah that kid or someone else or both are gunna get hurt because of this kid. And with all the gym equipment like weights could be really serious injury. Like god forbid he goes under someone dropping weights doing overhead lifting. Theres broken bones to head damge that could happen. Its a big liability and big law suits waiting to happen. And just not professional for a gym environment having a kid messing and wandering around that people while working out have to keep a eye out and watch for someone else's kid so they dont get hurt. Shouldn't be allowed for good reasons. That parent is rude and bad parenting to even allow and let happen. Could cost them to lose people to other gyms. Need to put down and enforce rules involving kids and the saftey of those working out and in the gym
entitledparents,ffjgn0b,t3_etodio,1579997831.0,"Is this a high school school gym or a buisness? Im really surprised that no one, let alone any staff didnt immediately yell for everyone to stop what they were doing to get the kid off and away like right next to parent. I know couple gym owners and trainers that would stop everything and everyone and have kid get away from areas in use. And a stern talking to whoever brought the kid like stay with them or stay in a spot designated ok for kid to entertain themselves with phone or game. You need to tell the gym staff. That kid could get seriously hurt, it is just a accident waiting to happen. More so especially because kid seems to have no manners or common sense. Like this person doesn't see me so i should wait or go around, this could hurt me, im messing with these people's work out, im gunna run around where people likely dont hear and see me while working with heavy weights. Someone i use to know at their own house had heavy metal dumbbells on a lil rack on the floor and their lil kid messing with it and either knocked one off the rack or dropped one. Well lots of tears, blood and hospital visit later is missing a part of his toe. 

Yeah to the staff
Its not safe for the child and get seriously injured like broken bones, head damage or worse like from dropped weights from deadlifts. Or from the kid wandering and running around and get hurt from tripping on gym equipment. This kid sounds totally clueless, I'd say rude but its the parenting. Not a playground, its dangerous

Not good for their buisness. And could lose gym members. People won't get the best work out that they can if they themselves have to keep a eye on to watch out for someone else's lil kid just wondering around, doing as they like. And so stopping or changing work out because of kid. And many people that work out ""get in the zone ""and just tune everything out and assume everyone there knows like the gym rules like personal space and not to interfere. Need to have rules put in place for the saftey of those working out and those not like just there to watch etc like parents and kids. Like not working out then don't go in the work out space. Someone working out you go around them. Just common stuff. They could lose buisness, If its chaos and messing with people's work out, they will find a better gym

Kids distracting but also could cause people working out at the gym to get hurt themselves too. If the kids messing and playing with equipment, moving stuff around. Or while working out trying to avoid hurting a lil kid they just noticed, and could get hurt themselves from it. You need to have the right form and posture for certain work outs or its bad on your body. This kis is too distracting.

Yeah this is a lawsuit waiting to happen as some accident will happen like the close calls you had. Also it is just not a professional  gym environment. Nor is it to put it off on gym members to just deal with and try working around someone's kid. Either the kid or gym member or even both of em can get hurt and with the stuff in a gym could be very serious. Make and enforce some rules in place at least for kids and saftey. Like not allowed on the floor or area where others are working out or have to stick to their parent. And no running in a gym god thats just reckless with higher chance of getting hurt in a gym. Its also really rude and bad parenting for the parent to just let the lil kid go around bugging and messing with people and their work outs and letting the kid go wherever and do as they please in a gym being used. Its a big liability"
entitledparents,ffj31rj,t3_ettd2u,1579989131.0,"As a little dog too they get freezing quick and fast. Like even just giving my rescue lil poodle a bath. I put the fans off, air conditioning turn down. Then rub him down as dry as i can then hold him in a dry towel. He just shivers really hard so i try and get him dry as fast as i can so hes not miserable and uncomfortable. That why lil dogs wear sweaters and stuff, they're so small they don't have good body heat to keep warm. 

So yeah a tiny and old dog out in the freezing not good for its health. And poor thing can't hear and going blind. Seems like it happened at night so would be freezing and dark for the lil guy. Yeah neglectful shes *GAMBLING with the dog's LIFE* like maybe he will find his way back or maybe never seen again. And idk where you live but could have other animals up and around at night and that old lil, blind and deaf dog would be perfect target of prey. How lazy like if a loved em as you claim like a family member and kids love them so much you all get in the car to get em. And even thank the person you have issues with but was nice to help and care of em for you. And maybe the dog had been trying to get back inside their house but no one at the house was letting him back in so he wondered away for help and ended up at your place to get them and inside finally. Or ran away."

Omg thats too funny getting money for chicken! Kiddo you didn't waste time! Lol did they get a cut of the chicken ""working"" with you? Lol Yeah when i was lil i did stupid stuff especially with friends i just now think why!!?? Lol and a lot of thank god! But yeah gut feeling as helped me many times and many situations. Sometimes ill ignore it but in situations not dangerous in anyway (when it is i listen) and then think god why didn't i listen to myself!? Lol I saw something dont know where was a video somewhere but didn't get to watch whole thing about the actual science behind your ""gut feeling"" and the many things that go into the reason you have such a feeling and think such a way remember some was like subconsciously if your not paying full attention if someone means you harm you still notice stuff that rings the alarms. God wish i knew where if youtube or tv but yeah not something about you being feelings or just but your body reacting. And body language says a lot to you"

AmItheAsshole,ffhoz8w,t3_etguwh,1579946175.0,"You should get him into therapy and maybe some group family therapy for everyone like other kids to better express and understand, and show together you're not a outsider or anything that adopted kids can feel. In his case probably weird, hurt and rejected that could snowball into bigger issues. And could have him unsure, stress or anxiety facing older relatives knowing they would know but probably would just play dumb and not bring it up not knowing what to do but have a feeling not felt with them before. Better to nip anything in the bud before and not let them handle something so strong, world changing and being kids they don't know how best to express themselves, or understand what they're even feeling, understand situation better and how to handle it. Kids may seem impulsive but when in a difficult situation from divorce to this are just reacting and some rebel. And yeah better to do it now then later after being very troubled and get into stuff like in trouble  from with other kids, school, drugs, the law. This would be hard even for a adult as it changes a lot that they thought they knew. But you are a great dad. Maybe one day you guys can jokes about it like mine would but we can have very sarcastic, dry, witty and the just cheesy humor. But not for awhile since its new but after somewhat idk years and kids have adjusted and handled it good with no worries it would be the cause of any rebellion. Hope the best for you and your family. You're better then many others that fail as parents. You're a great dad! But yes try therapy now and not wait till trouble comes then there could more to do if something does happen and he probably has questions hes unsure how or nervous about talking about"
entitledparents,ffhm3k4,t1_ffgx6q3,1579941789.0,I think it ended fast after that. From how they acted and stuff im guessing. With the son's entitled stupid behavior in public with literally a whole audience seeing her date act like such a ass probably thinking he was so badass lolol If that wasnt it then was red flags or embarrassing enough to then running off and telling on the mean movie people to mommy(seriously?) Did he not think you guys basically say why like well ma'am because after their warning to behave we were concerned the audience of kids would not learn but watch how babies are made during the movie and thats why we kicked them out. And son was aggressive. But yeah going back where she was already embarrassed in front of so many and him only making more of a scene and having to stop and drag him out only to then be dragged back there and face you guys again had to be more embarrassment and just rethinking her life choices like the nail to the coffin. And mom putting all the blame on her and what shes doing to her angel that quick!? Wow Yeah she not gunna be that pleasent to the girl and always back the son even when terrible and obvious. And questioning everything about her that could be a bad influence or how you should be treating my son. Maybe blaming her for whole thing with having her angel banned and cant go back now because shes a s**t who got her son into the bad scene driving em home. But seriously who picks a movie thats new so then packed let alone a kids one especially where all ages see so more people to fool around?! And in front rows! I get being young and but when does your dignity go out the window?

Basically how smarter people will openly admit to and say I don't know (about whatever it is) when they don't so then they can learn it and so then know more.

ProRevenge,ffhglm3,t3_et9mno,1579934355.0,"Why my mom taught me to takes pics of everything before moving stuff in and whatever has any damage or issue as a record of was like this before us and has us clean like the queen is staying over before moving out. Sometimes like with lots of carpets gets those vacuums u rent to wash and renew. And sister and i spent what felt forever pulling any weeds that are everywhere that area of state, mowed lawn just going whole yards whole 9 yards. And takes lots of pics, there is nothing to bitch about not one spot. Shes a si gle mom of four kids shes getting that deposit. But one guy tried getting money from us saying we left the house so filthy and trashed that he had to hire cleaners. She presents the pics(think was day you still developed photos with cell phones still crap so has full dates on em) and he lost. 

Yeah do like a documentation on everything moving in. How everything works from sinks to shelves in closet and the condition. So if its bad then you can show its not by you and time took it. Then clean like your getting off the grid with no evidence anyone ever lived there before. And need the house and yard to look like its a brand new. And loads of pics of it after. Hell have fun with some creative and questionable selfies and stuff with doing it. Even if the person is the sweetest like lil granny like this the heir might be a dick or your friend. Its a good rule to have to protect yourself as money or disagreement etc can bring out ugly sides of people."
ProRevenge,ffgweye,t3_du8pnr,1579916778.0,"You are so brave, really smart too and even under such pressure! They also say there's flight or fight but not alot know there's also freeze reaction. Many have this reaction especially under some sort of sexual crime, just in shock and panic its like you can't even think of what to do or say. Staying calm and collected but spoke up when he was getting more dangerous. And use your observations of the rosary in his car. A good tactic in dealing with dangerous people in terrible situations is trying to connect to them someway with humanity and morals. Like one girl saved herself from a rapist that took her when she said to him what would your family, the people you love think of you doing this? And he broke down and let her go. You never told the monster you can't do that or something like that, that would probably anger him with such a fragile lil ego like glass and best not to make them feel its under attack. He was such a horrible person and cop that many others didn't like or felt something off about him. And you going to the cops i imagine had to be very scary even though it wasn't his town's department. I would think being worried they would brush you off like to protect another cop or if he had ties in there too. But you were great. Calm but showed distress of what this person was to you and well spoken with them like saying you had no criminal records or anything and not saying this for some deal but for him to get put in his place since he was dangerous and abuse power tripping corrupted officer. And you studied him well, like the dates, time, and his habits from when he would come. And god thing you did with all that horrible and twisted stuff found. No doubt he had done evil things as a cop or off duty. He did a pat down on you so quick and easily that hes probably pulled that a lot. Probably sick things too with women criminals. God on you getting that thing behind bars where he belongs and deal with what he's been like to others.

Remember people, Trust your gut! It has helped and/or saved many people when they felt something like a place or someone was off and not right. And if you feel unsafe, DO NOT WORRY ABOUT BEING RUDE! Get out with whatever excuse, reason nothing but out and away fast as you can. There's serial killers, rapist, pedophiles and kidnappers that used people's kindness and not wanting to be rude with some excuse to lure them somewhere like where no one else is or in towards their car to push in and take them. And many don't want to be rude with whatever excuse they have like many involve needing some sort of help with something. One serial killer would a trick of prending to be helpless using a cane and walk badly with a limp and ask women to help get his item in his car. Then the classic Can you help me I lost my puppy/kid. Trust your gut if something feels off, or somethings not right with someone. Reddit even has threads with people's own stories on how without any reason but just their gut and how it save them or the person turned out to be more then they appeared if not a criminal of some sort then someone who was more drama and trouble worth anything to deal with. Its helped me greatly couple times myself"

But this pisses me off on a more personal level. A friend of mine had physical health issues. For at least a year(estimate likely longer) and whole time like stomach always hurt. It wasn't until she was in such horrible stomach pain and taken to E.R for it and found out she had *CANCER!* Something as really serious like that you want to start right away and work on it to be cleared of it.

Said having them there really made them feel more relaxed since it was handled. Looking it up says that a off-duty police officer typically costs $40-$60 per hour for security guard services. Interested clients can contact a local police department for availability and rates, which can be expensive because the officer is working overtime. And police officers retain all their lawful powers while off duty there too like even arrest etc. Treating her as a trespasser and must leave property immediately, a police order.

Like why do and pick a amount of 500 then? If was like super ridiculous like a million it wouldn't be believed.  With people would be like yeah thats a joke. People usually give the reward without being asked for it 1st and yes sometimes people decline the reward but thats for that person to decline the reward. Not the one who offered and had someone take the time and effort to get pet and reunite. Theres people who pay more then that to get a loved pet back. 

When making the sign what was the thought behind it? Didnt have to put 500 or even a reward at all! Why 500 as the amount they settled for? Like no 50 is too low lile we dont care but cat didnt cost a thousand? Put signs up thinking people will want to help and keep a look out more for a chance at a lot of money but if they thought putting reward and whatever amount was just something people do with lost pet signs then why not higher? People like them all know people in the past have gotten the reward money in the last.

 So yeah they either liars or entitled in just expected to be let off the hook with the promise they made. That they themselves made and posted them upand again put 500 up couldve then just put word reward like some do and give how much they actually be ok with paying.

Guess she really thought highly of herself and that she wasn't responsible and in any trouble and so was untouchable.  A kind of quality i find that many idiots tend to share."
AmItheAsshole,felej4x,t1_fekzh54,1579220305.0,"Well did she say her dad helpped her by paying off her debts? And that the dads agreeing or entertaining the idea of it going to his daughter seem like he has spoiled her and still does even as a women in her 30s. Dont know if shes a only child but if so and that she a girl and seems like a ""daddys girl"" and with a dad not still with her mom and so was single and dating till now married well it happens a lot in that situation that the father spoils their ""lil girl"". And shes seems plenty spoiled and entitled to me. Money should be used to honer her daughter but maybe also sessions with a therapist as well since losing a child is very difficult and now with this situation with her husband her his daughter who openly showed she doesn't like her but hey give me ur dead daughters money so i can be comfy aka spoiled. Like yeah she could use some to talk to a professional about help with losing her kid and also her marriage with her husband and her step daughter both of which seem to have NO RESPECT for her and the daughter she lost in a accident so suddenly. And she even said she doesnt even need to money but basically upgrade ur current situation. Its so disrespectful to her where they should be supportive of her emotionally and however she chooses to honer her kid instead"
trashyboners,fekrkqu,t1_fekjzss,1579206143.0,"Probably thought they're being ""cool and edgy"" but were just being such attention seekers in such a cringey way.

But yeah if a kid was there and saw em and what they were doing then they just exposed their private parts and showed sexual acts being done to another with a child as a unwilling witness and could get fined and charged for the crimes dealing with sexually crimes to a child. And yeah possiblity of even being on the a pedophile sexual type registry. Which with those crimes and  either on that registry or not, just with those crimes to a child alone would effect where they can find work, live and such like with background checks done and well no one wants someone with crimes like that no matter the job etc. So yeah not only are they not cool but not smart either"
todayilearned,feiteh0,t3_epaqee,1579146724.0,Wow its strange and sucks how sometimes things just seem like common sense but had to be learn throughout history to get something right. And its gunna keep happening to the future too and they'll think of us in our time and be wait they did that?!
entitledparents,feit259,t1_fehk11k,1579146474.0,How is her and her kid relationship? Cause ur cousin least didnt turn up like her and tried helping u while disapproving and embarrassed by her behavior. I would never go in public or be near them if i had a parent like that. Sounds like the stories of kids who once he was 18 left home and lost or has little contact and visits with ur nasty aunt
entitledparents,feist57,t3_ep74tz,1579146292.0,"Wow how trashy that women is. Not only treating workers she think are low like that and actually hitting them! Life would be harder without people doing those jobs she thinks is beneath her. And having u run all around for her own amusement like i wish the manager was there to see and had her get out of line to finish her shopping. But like to then do that to her own family member and be like no its ok cause im ur aunt.... ok so not only r u a bitch but thats how u even treat family?

She like making others miserable obviously and literally was making u and worker dance for her. Like does she thinks she the QUEEN? Least her kid didnt turn up like her and actually tried helping u while disapproving her behavior."
ProRevenge,fehyadx,t3_ejgkpt,1579126297.0,"I get wanting to mess with family who are terrible but why not just give all the money only to those he liked and loved?  Then again he must've loved having them on the edge of their seats and felt like a puppet master. I heard that if someone in a family dies and think this is only for old or sick people and that if they left nothing for someone and usually is on purpose then that person left out could fight agaisnt it to get money saying they were ""forgotten about"" during the writing of will. So now people will leave a small amount like a dollar to show i didnt forget about u so u cant fight for more and yeah left u only a dollar but think even lower of u"
ProRevenge,fehui29,t1_ey3a9i1,1579124121.0,"It also helps that if you make a agreement or loan someone money and even if its someone close like family or friends to get a paper. Write the date and something like I (your full name) gave (person's full name getting money) a loan of (full amount of money youre giving them) amount.(then talk about what kind of payment plan you want or they can do and write that) something like (their full name) will pay me back next paycheck, month or in monthly installments of (however much u agree) until they paid the amount in full. And then both of you sign it at the bottom. Sadly many relationships even family go downhill when money is involved and they dont pay back or try saying its wasnt a loan they gave it as a gift.

AND ALSO IMPORTANTLY! If you are paying someone back whether its one time or multiple over time or you are buying something from them. Each time u give them the cash or check have a paper and put date of ur full name gave (their name) (amount of money your paying them back or for something) for (reason ur giving them this money and have both sign it and keep it! If they want one too then get it copied or write and do the same on another paper.

Many people will say like oh they never paid me back for it or they didnt give me the money for whatever or say you only paid like half or some low number instead of the amount u actually did.

When it comes to money family and friends can change. My mom told me to do this anytime i do something involving money with someone and thats what i say if they try not doing it like why would we need to do that just say some thing like its something your grandparents have made ur family do in such situations. But honestly you dont need to give a reason for doing this as protection for yourself. If someone that your gunna lend money to is like fighting u on do it then take that as a red flag they want the money and ghost u"
entitledparents,fefgclg,t1_f7kkw0s,1579055743.0,"I dont know what those look like but where im from theres these bushes that ""look"" beautiful with red or pink flower but like on the outside of it and high like on top but REAL BIG NASTY THORNS seriously theyre huge like nails if u look at em under the flower that are at the highestpoint! Those would be good. Cause not only are they also pretty but kid proof lol cause yeah when i was lil a rowdy boy was messing and like messing with a neighbors front yard where lil garden was and not their whole front yard. My friends and i liked that young couple cause they were sweet to us and sometime even let us see and play with their puppy or see their birds, the bird we couldnt touch but look at since shy which was fine with us kids anway but yeah we were on great terms.

 Well while messing around yelling he fell and on his ass on one of those bushes. This mean bratty boy was now a mess like a toddler crying and screaming with some throrns like how animals or people look after a run with a porcupine still in him like his but especially that had to be pulled out. I felt bad for him and we didnt make fun but tried helpping but didnt know how so got his dad. He stayed away from me and my friends after that and never messed or bullied us after since i guess he was so embarrassed like reputation ruined for him. I stay a good GOOD distance away from those bushes when i spot them to this day"
entitledparents,fefeqqu,t3_e1p05x,1579054763.0,"Thats great. Yeah its tough especially when its family but when its a toxic person and relationship it best to get space from them and not be verbally and emotionally abused any more by them. If ur sister had never even tried stealing ur wedding which wtf hey since i share ur brithdays cause im jealous, selfish and shit then im gunna share ur wedding too but u can be a bridesmaid instead. But if she never tried taking that from u and having ur sorry but horrible parents on her side too she might have never broken up with that guy or least got married but he saw her true ways and colors earlier. I wonder what the parents are thinking now? Taking care of her who only treats herself good like do they have any regrets at all if not on taking her side on ur wedding they how they raised her? Having her have two birthdays maybe 3 if also with brother cause she wanted stuff like another special day on her, attention and of course get presents too. Just doing that molded her into being self centered, herself 1st, super entitled lile even other's weddings. It was like a butterfly effect making her blossom into a bitch. Im gunna guess she doesnt clean, cook, work, pay rent or bills, take care or most of the care of her baby but that all work and her responsibilities are put on parents which they had coming with how they raised and treated her even in to adulthood. I think they wouldnt even make her do some chores or bills if they wanted or let alone even ask her to. And so taking care of the house, meals, give her money and take care of her baby. Its messed up and over something so stupid like no you spend so much time, years working on and planning that wedding and her just recently engaged should have it? And because she was pregnant with some sort of class and so couldn't plan a wedding? Bullshit. She could do it and night or any time and ask family to help plan but no shes lazy and u have somethig she wanted a beautiful wedding so she was gunna take the lazy, easy, selfish and the entitled way to get that and not do it herself. Good riddance i say and spending time away from them will make them think and reflect on it like the chain of events that got them where they are. Maybe in the future you'll reconnect again but if u do u need to set ground rules like ur sister isnt a dictator she what she wants goes. Treat u kindly and respectfully. If sister does something mean, bad consequences will follow like a kid"
entitledparents,fefcnpc,t1_ex2giyq,1579053435.0,"Exactly what i thought. Like i wouldve loved that after he said that she says oh thank u dad for understanding. She'll probably be upset at 1st that she isnt getting mine and having her way but your right it doesn't matter where sis gets married but to whom! And since she said she wanted mine cause since the pregnancy she could plan a wedding too. Then i could help her plan and figure out where and what she wants to do for her wedding thats affordable for her but beautiful. Thank you for understanding and taking my side, from the past and how it was always her 1st i felt she was the favorite and important kid but you sticking up for me really shows me that you do care and love me a lot too. That you guys love and want me to ve happy and have the wedding i want and worked on too.

See turn it around to be about the sister but that you will try and help make whatever she plans to do speical and great too. Basically it means a lot to u i mean years planning this shit and glad they feel that way but you'll be good too. Like her excuse that she couldnt plan it could pregnant classes (or whatever which isnt 24/7 and u have free time and can be done at any hour) and help her with the planning since she said she couldnt. And so giving a solution to her weak excuse. And then lay it thick and cry if u can or sound like u are that ur so happy hes being like logical understanding all the years or work, time and effort into what you wanted. And that he was on ur side in this when you always felt they loved her most and like u werent even 3rd best. How much this means to you. 

So basically use his words around on him with his logic. And take away the sisters excuse that she NEEDED your wedding cause couldnt plan but now u and hell the mom and other family on her side will help plan it then so she can have a wedding she wants. Dont let the dad speak but talk over. And lay the last blow of how much what he did means to u with u since lil felt she was the favorite and such and u unwanted. Now no excuses why she cant plan a good wedding with the time she does have but help from family and use heart strings so the dad feels like a asshole like if this convo were to happen i dont think he would be as angry and ur selfish cause saying how she felt and the dad still being a ass to her well wouldnt take a idiot to see oh so u do love her more and not me. Like what could he say no i love u too i just want her to have this...beautiful wedding you been planning and working on for years.

This family like shared birthdays with sis cause she got jealous yeah thats gunna mold her as a entitled ass growing up
 I think all kids get jealous of other kids birthdays but mostly cause they get presents. Just this really spoiled and made her sister entitled its basically upgraded from sharing her birthday to sharing her wedding!  Like well you get to have a good wedding so im going to too but not sharing it! This family is gunna fall out over something so stupid but those parent and sister oh and other family that basically thinks this sister walks on water should always get her way and if not ur the bad guy? Very toxic. My she and her brother and any family like the Aunt could do sperate holiday etc stuff at her house or theirs and such without those 3 and family with em. Would probably be healthy having such toxic people and relationships out of ur life like a lot less stress and depression for whatever think u do or say thats basically nothing but she didnt like and get attacked by all the other for example"
AmItheAsshole,fe8ban8,t3_enyuvv,1578924434.0,"NTA u and ur daughter loved and cherished it, you both wore it in a serious and respectful way. He wants to make it ugly and a mockery of it and by extension you and ur daughter. Tell him he may think its stupid but to you this dress holds like a special sentimental to you. But tell him hes free to go out and buy his own dress to do that shit to. Very disrespectful and no empathy or anything to how this make u and daughter feel and its a dress but has a lot of memories and meaning to you like getting ready to get married and walking dead seeing ur husband. But im sorry ur son is giving me such entitlement vibes not giving a shit how it makes u and daughter feel and feel affected by it. Dont let him pull any well if u dont let me do it with ur dress then ur a homophobic or agaisnt drag card on u or sister is the favorite. No when it deals with a belonging of yours that means a lot and when your daughter wanted to wear it too i assume that made u really happy bit only changes she did was to fit her shape and not like make a new dress and thats even more sweet and special like ur daughter wore your dress starting a type tradition. 

One family has a wedding dress about 100 or almost and has a tradition that every bride of that family or marrying into wore it and it was so beautiful like from a old movie or movie from the old times but in a good way that sounded like a insult lol. They barely changed anything about which it was just a classic like princess dress only change made was to fit each other brides.

So yeah ask ur son to respect this as it means a lot to you and to him it might just be silly like just a dress but not to u. I imagine u would see memories looking at it like a picture. And that he can do the drag thing but to go get the dress he wants to redecorate and design for it"

 J.K Rowling said long ago the books the lile 1st drafts weren't kid friendly too like Harry and Ron etc cursed a lot among other more stuff i forget what else but more for teenagers and adults. But they made her make it aimed towards kids. Just imagine if she didn't make it for lil kids and what she originally wanted it, what would be different? Characters? Magic? More naughty type spells and not the love spell or the 3 illgeal ones. Romance being more then just talking and kissing? What was magic sex even be life! Like many fans said probably lots of abortions spells with so many kids and teens and so little teachers to watch every one. Ok ive gone to the rabbit hole of harry potter of theres logic but also there isn't lolol"
