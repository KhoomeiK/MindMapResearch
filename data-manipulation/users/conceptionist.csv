Queens,fekd1ey,t3_ephd7i,1579197494.0,"I don't know about all of you but I ALWAYS avoid products and services in forceful ads like that on YouTube, spam calls, unwanted mail, pop-ups and now.. the MTA. The only way I ever buy products and services is when they are non intrusive. If everyone did this, it would not be an issue and the companies that waste money on forceful annoying ads would only lose money, very quickly! This is how evolution of everything works. Companies with decent products and services don't really need advertisement at all because usually they are recommended by those who'm are pleased with their products and services. It's usually greed by investors to pump money into intrusive advertisements that often backfires and this certainly is no exception."

GlobalWarming,fdi7oma,t3_el8u7w,1578437210.0,"With the population in India, those best suited to make it through such temperatures are guaranteed to become the holders of optimal genetics in adaptation for climate change when it comes to surviving outdoors and will likely pass on their seed to future generations to come. Unless of-course if they stay indoors with AC on then it doesn't really contribute that way."

tripreports,fd7nf7h,t3_ejz50g,1578207159.0,"It's strange that many people can tolerate, even have great experiences on shrooms according to trip reports I've read or youtube videos I've seen. Others like OP and myself included can't have any pleasant experiences with it. It seems like it may be due to blood type, genetics, brain configuration or chemistry reactions. Took me couple of tries with 1g dry, using different strains at different weekly intervals to realize shrooms are certainly not for me. Although weed does seem like it's the opposite of feels, than gloomy feel that shrooms provide, I've been sober for the past year and NOTHING beats that, ever."
