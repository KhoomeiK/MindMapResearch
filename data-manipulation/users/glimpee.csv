I do agree we could go a bit further as a society allowing dads to stay at home and take time off. But im telling ya, scandanavian countries have time off for men and women and the whole shebang and the differences widened. Im down to get to that stage, but I dont think the results would be what youd expect.

Think about it. Over there, they just give totally equal treatment enforced by the law. Over here we push men to be more femenine and women to be more masculine. Men to stay more more and women to work me. Key word is that we *push* that. Social engineering. Id prefer everyone just gets the choice without the pressure. I know that social engineering was meant to combat the pre-existing social pressures, but I think its gone just slightly too far in some respects, and not far enough in others.

But thing is, just because men dont take time off as often as women doesnt mean there isnt equality of choice. They choose to stay at work, just as women choose to take time off. Just because you might not like the results of those choices, theyre still choices - unless you wanna make an argument otherwise

Edit: interesting my comments in this thread are being downvoted - am I saying something contravertial or insulting so anyone?"
SelfAwarewolves,ffy2dgy,t1_ffxs5et,1580337239.0,"Im mobile so I wont have quotes

So in Scandinavia, the social and legal system is the most equitable in the world. And surprising, as it got more equity, the differences in men and women actually increased. They arent social engineering as much as we are, and men and women feel they can make whatever choice they want socially moreso than nearly anywhere else, yet those differences increase.

And chicken and the egg, its interesting to consider where these gender roles came from. Back before civilization, those were simply the biologically driven roles. It is only in the past 100 or so years that we've questioned those roles, and we dont yet know the damage the subsequent social engineering can cause. We do know that women on average are less happy persuing careers for their entire lives.

When it comes to asking for a raise, I think we should inform and coach people, men and women, as to what is required to step up the ladder in traditional work environments. Im not a fan of catering, because those are simply ideas made by individuals imposed onto companies as opposed to the natural growth they would take. Meaning, I think that kind of corperate engineering is likely to cause more problems than it solves. Thats consistent with humans

We tried to engineer eco-systems before... that never works out. Im a believer in letting things evolve naturally, and placing some restrictions where needed to curb exploitation and the like.

So I think we should educate and coach women. Jordan Peterson has noted that he has done this with his therapy clients and it has boosted them up corperate ladders.

Im fairly feminine, at least more than most men, so asking for that raise is uncomfortable for me, so im working on that skill. Later today im going somewhere to follow up on an application, something that ive been pushing off because I ""dont want to be a bother."" Thatll keep me down as much as it would a woman of similar personality. Its not a purely gendered issue.

Bosses like to see initiative and passion. It speaks to their work ethic and perspective. It does us all good to step up and show that.

I am not religious, so I cant comment on how religion ties to abortion.

My position is philosophical. We dont know when life begins, so I choose to play it safe and assume it begins at conception, when the unique dna is formed and, if left alone, will become a baby, which left untouched, will grow up and die on their own.

Its the interventionist action of abortion im against for that reason. Though I think outlawing abortiontomorrow would be a bad move, socially and politically

If pregnancy had nothing to do with choice (the choice to have sex) I might think differently, but thats not the case in the majority of cases.

You have sex, you get pregnant, I then think its kinda gross to end that life because its undetermined *when* we want to arbitrarily define it as alive. It *is* human. Though if the womans life is at risk, I put her life over the fetus.

There are still assults on gay rights from the right, but if I recall thats just the fringe. What are the mainstream assults on gay rights?

The cake thing is a weird one - the cake maker is a comissioned artist. Im an animator, if you ask me to do a 5 minute hentai, ill probably say ""no, I dont want to spend the next 4 + months doing that, find someone else."" 

And if I recall, the couple was going from christian bakery to bakery trying to find someone to say no.

If it were a gym, yeah id be standing with you. But forcing an artist to make an art piece that goes against their religion, I think freedom dictates they dont have to do it.

And im a fan of the free market deciding, either way. If a corperation has ideas you dont like, spread the word and dont give them your buisness. I cant fathom I would ever want to legally force someone to make me something that goes against their beliefs anyways

That amendment is talking about the right to vote, not to have someone make you a cake, right?

Also theres a growing mainstream right that either isnt religous or seperating religion from policy. None of the arguments ive made are religious, and im nowhere near alone with those perspectives"
SelfAwarewolves,ffxkoy4,t1_ffxjwnd,1580327094.0,"I dont think its fair to say everyone is suffering from it. Couples make these decisions together. If you look at scandanavian countries, they are the most equitable countries in the world. The more equitable they got, the more they found men and women persuing historic roles. Women going into people oriented jobs like nursing or staying home *more,* and men going into fields where they work with things and stuff like STEM more, which is exactly what everyone *didnt* expect to happen. 

Currently in the US we are trying to push women *out* of the house, and I think people are suffering from that. I mean, that even seems to be your stance, you think its bad women choose to stay home more than men. You even call it a sacrifice. My solution is to value both paths equally, stay at home and career, and let individuals decide what they want, instead of seeing staying at home as a suffering sacrificing burden, see it as a choice."
SelfAwarewolves,ffxjn7k,t1_ffxj3sl,1580326482.0,"Well of course you make less money when you raise a kid, kids are investments, not products.

Its not that she'll make less if she has a child, its that she'll make less if she takes time off to go to the childs games or care for the child. Same if a man did that, but men are just less likely to take as much time off.

If someone chooses to work less, theyre gunna make less, and theyre going to have a harder time climbing the ladder. Man or women. Its just that women are more likely to make that choice. I dont think thats a bad thing, but I also dnt think its anyones responsibility to pay someone who makes that choice as much as someone who doesnt."
SelfAwarewolves,ffxi2ao,t1_ffwk3gs,1580325570.0,"Hey, I made a response to the person that responded to this ^ post, breaking down the actual mainstream modern conservative takes on these issues. If you want to hear it from one of us, id check it out. These people are maybe painting stereotypes of us correctly, but is missing our actual stance on these topics pretty hard"
SelfAwarewolves,ffxgqvy,t1_ffwn7gq,1580324818.0,"Conservatives dont see abortion as a womans issue, they see it as a murder issue

The gender pay gap isn't accurate. From 20-30 women make more than men in the same fields. Its from 30+ that the overall average of all women compared to all men is different, and of course it is. Men and women make different choices (not that one choice is better) - women work an average of 30 hours while men work an average of 35, men and women go into different professions, men tend to be more aggressive so are more likely to ask for a promotion/raise, women are more likely to cut hours in favor of family, at the upper ends of work hours (60-80 hrs a week) youll find a lot more men. 

Key point, women at 20-30 make more than men in the same jobs, but after then women tend to work less in favor of family. Women are at an advantage if they put everything into their career. 

So no, conservatives just dont *believe* in the gender pay gap. Its not cuz we think women are inferior. 

Mainstream conservatives dont want to force women to stay home either, we just think its as valid a choice to persuing a career. Yes, on incel and far-right forms youll see a range of posts from satire to serious saying women should stay home - thats not mainstream conservative. We just think women are being forced into careers when thats not always the best option for each individual. We feel that stay-at-home-moms are looked down upon, and thats a damn shame. We feel the nuclear family is under attack, not that everything *must* be nuclear.

Really the conservatives ive talked to want a open choice between stay-at-home and career, and we feel the social push to get women in careers has gone a bit too far and we want to pull it back, the Scandinavian countries seem to have a good balance as far as im aware

I think you deeply misunderstand modern mainstream conservatives. I think most people do. I think thats why theres so much hate against us. We have evolved too, and thats thanks to progressive movements honestly. The right has lost some fights and then actually turned around and agreed, like gay marriage. Conservatives dont seem to care anymore, though some believe the government shouldnt force institutions like marriage (which is religous) to do things

If youd like to talk a bit more and get some further perspectives on the rational conservative movement, please let me know. I deeply want to see more understanding across the aisle"
SelfAwarewolves,ffxfgmy,t1_ffwi89u,1580324075.0,"I think thats how reddit liberals would describe conservatives. Conservatives might argue that there is now too much pressure on women to go persue a career and its looked down on women to opt to stay at home/take care of the kids/house, and many think that its a bad thing. I havent heard a moderate conservative say that women should be kept at home, just that the push against stay-at-home moms is dangerous, as there is biological drive to take care of the kids and many women are finding that after 10 years of persuing a career, they just arent happy.

But thats a small sliver of the mainstream conservative movement"

Just because someone was in the army doesnt make them evil. I doubt the vast majority of us would have the balls to stand up to the entire army from within its ranks or refuse the draft at the cost of death. We might even tell ourselves ""I dont have a choice, but maybe if I stay alive I can help reduce some of the damage""

 Maybe he didnt even know what was going on in the concentration camps, maybe he did. This person isnt hitler, we dont know if he was in fact evil or not.

And if I dont know what kind of person someone is, ill eer on the side of caring that they die."
