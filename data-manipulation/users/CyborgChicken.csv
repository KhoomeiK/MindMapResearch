There's a social aspect in it too, like you can curry favor with the townsfolk and get married, but I ignore that.

I do spend a lot of time in null sec, but oddly not too many logistics seem to end in there. I did about 150 jumps around this evening and in a t3 frigate without any issues.

The only stations with logistics are the ITC's. And you can only see what the ITC you are at has going out... Right now we can't see more than that, so it's kinda a gamble.

Take some contracts, and while on route bring up the logistics menu and see if the ITC you are passing by has anything going to your current destination (or maybe a few hopes in the wrong direction if the isk is worth it). Rinse and repeat! Its a nice way to see the universe."
