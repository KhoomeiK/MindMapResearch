EDIT: Fourth paragraph in.

"" The news is shocking and attention-grabbing, but as Professor Jarman  points out, his work **is not proof of a particular problem with the NHS**.  Instead, he says it is ""no more than a trigger to further see whether  the large differences in adjusted death rates … indicate possible  differences in the quality of hospital care in the two countries"". ""

**Further down:**

"" However, no further methodology has been provided for England or other  countries, so we can't say whether the methods used to collect data on  HSMRs over the past 10 years were appropriate. Professor Jarman's  analysis does not appear to have been peer-reviewed. """
insanepeoplefacebook,fgncp8h,t1_fgnbi7m,1580942085.0,"not a propaganda puppet, just using the experience i have as a UK citizen.   
Ive yet to see the NHS actively murder patients.

All my talking points are from a wide source of information, examples being BBC (Unbaised, tax payer ran news), Fox (Right Wing), WaPo(supposed left wing), Guardian(supposed Left Wing), Daily Mirror (Right Wing), i also watched all of the Impeachment trial and actively tuned in to any CSPAN US Political event. 

i'm also an active voter in the UK and study both sides extensively before i come up with my decisions  


If any of my points come across as ""Copy/Paste"" i do apologise, but it is mere coincedence"
