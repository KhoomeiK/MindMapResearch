I liked the RDR2 hunting because it was actual, unrestricted open-world gameplay.

You had a list of skins/furs/whatnot you could hunt for, and certain rewards for obtaining certain combinations, but ultimately it was up to you what you wanted to search for, and how you wanted to try and find them...pace/order/strategy is all up to you.

WTF,ff8pwlj,t1_ff64zc4,1579691014.0,"No, I pretty much agree with all of that.

I'm of the /r/ZeroWaste slash /r/BuyItForLife slash /r/AntiConsumption persuasion, so my take is that we should reject the idea that you need a *new* dress for your wedding.

Women get married constantly (I mean, on a macro level, haha), so there's no real reason you can't have a huge used-dress market. Sure, dresses have to fit, but enough weddings happen to provide a pretty good supply of them, and a bridal store dedicated to finding you one that suits you (and still allowing for reasonable alterations) could offer an alternative to always buying new.

In fact, rather than buying and reselling an item you wear once, dresses could simply be *rented* at a much more affordable rate.

If this sounds at all familiar, it's because that's *exactly what we already do with grooms' suits.*

So the only reason we don't do it is arbitrary, dated social pressures."
