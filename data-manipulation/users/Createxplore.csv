Psychonaut,fei0ztf,t1_fegaidb,1579127926.0,"Cool stuff. I had an experience on my first acid trip of feeling like I saw how me and my best friend have had many past lives together. It was really cool. At the same time as being my best friend I saw he had a lot more depth and experience with other people than me, so I wasnt his only focus. But that didnt mean he cared about me any less."
