Dogtraining,ff3bssm,t3_er16ft,1579538071.0,"Thank you for rescuing her in the first place! Also, I don't know if she's able to reach you when you're standing up but if not you can try and see when she's about to do it and get up so she won't, then give her a treat for not doing it. Also works if you're able to redirect her attention when you see she's about to do it the moment before, either with a treat or toy that you throw away, it could help. The redirecting method usually works pretty well on all kind of behaviours like leash / leg biting. My dog makes some very recognizable moves when she's about to bite her leash which allows me to redirect her before she does."
Dogtraining,fefxh37,t1_feeyk8z,1579068444.0,"Oh yea I could try and use this to help reinforce the other techniques , thank you !"
Dogtraining,fef5ig3,t1_fef488h,1579048662.0,"I usually try and grab some sticks and pinecones on the way to redirect her but sometimes she gets bored of them quite fast. The ""drop it"" could be very useful though. I tought her the ""stop"" but since it can be use in different occasions she'd probably get it better with a more specific order. Thank you!"
Dogtraining,fef5aia,t1_fef40tf,1579048513.0,"Oh I didn't knew this could be a thing, I guess I thought it would just encourage her to go on but if she gets the rules I get it can work well. I'm currently still teaching her the ""drop it"" when I play tug with her tug toys and I'll definitely do it more often so she gets it faster and I can move on to the leash. Thank you !"

dogs,fdw0tk6,t3_emzekh,1578753847.0,Usually dogs don't go crazy for no reasons. First thing I'd check if I were you is if he has any physical problem with the vet. Maybe he has some kind of pain he doesn't know how to deal with? If there's none I'd recommend seeing a trainer specialized in dogs behaviour. He could help you find out what triggers your dog to act this way so you could prevent it.
dogs,fdvzcey,t1_fdqfqr1,1578753429.0,"As I border collie/Australian shepherd owner I'd also recommend them to you. If the dogs comes from a family who haven't used their parents, grandparents etc. to herd their instincts might not be very sharp, mine mostly just does the ""lying down, head down"" pose that's typical from shepherds when they herd the sheeps but that's pretty much all. She never barks nor circles anyone. She's also very friendly with pretty much everyone, very affective even with strangers or childrens. But yea she came from a family who had her parents as ""countryside family dog"" and of course you can never be sure any dog will fit perfectly its supposed character type regarding his breed. But if you get a puppy you can pretty much model him to be trained being around young childrens, that's for sure. The only point I'd emphasize if you want to get one is just to make sure you will give him enough mental stimulation, this is very important for such dogs. 
Hope you'll find your dream dog!"
dogs,fdvv84g,t3_emw2i5,1578751849.0,"What I would recommend is when he does bite, even if it's your clothes or doesn't hurt a lot, scream. Just, very loud, high pitched scream. The dog will understand this. If he goes on, redirect his attention on toys. And if he comes back for a third bite, pick him up and lock him in a small room with nothing to do (toilets or bathroom are usually the best, just remember to close the toilet seat) for no more than 30sec. After that time, the dog will have forgotten why he is locked up anymore so longer times are not necessary. 
That's what my dog trainer recommended. It worked really well on my puppy! 
Also to prevent this kind of behave, always make sure he has chewing toys available and maybe consider giving him homeopathic granules, the kind you give to childrens when their teeth are growing. It's not expensive so I gave some to mine for the first months and I believe it helped.
I'm sure you'll manage with a bit of patience! Anyway, good luck on working that out!"

lookatmydog,fd6qfim,t3_ejzfct,1578194464.0,"Now THIS was such a perfect title. I always want to know the exact breed , age and sex of dogs in picture whenever they're known (idk I just like knowing) and your title made my day! Thanks mate"
AmItheAsshole,fcu47k1,t3_eipecd,1577972136.0,"Wtf NTA, even when dogs are friendly, NO stranger should just come to pet it. Some people just assume dogs are friendly when they could get aggressive or scared. Coming up to pet a dog without asking the owner first is so disrespectful of both the dog and its owner... As a puppy owner it is so hard to educate her being calm with strangers when everyone just come and pet her and let her jump on them... I just can't do her education without educating other humans sometimes older than me?? Feels so wrong... 
Now since it was a toddler it's not really his fault but his mom definitely should be more careful about him and teaching him how to behave properly with animals."
AmItheAsshole,fctnlp4,t3_einuyo,1577950344.0,NTA . I mean what if I'd let my puppy bite down furniture or objects at other's houses? Anyone would be super pissed. Especially if that thing has sentimental value. Now my job as a pet owner is to prevent her from doing so in my and other people's houses and teach her how to play with her own toys instead. I really don't get how people like your sister are not teaching basics that are even tought to dogs to their kids?

I mean I do eat lots of candies from time to time but obviously it does not happen everyday... I realised by the responses I got that I am very misinformed about diabete in general, an ill have a talk about it with my endo next time I see her! I obviously don't want serious complications but don't really know how to avoid them all either..."
diabetes_t1,fcps1qz,t1_fcowo7x,1577870907.0,"Actually, I believe no specialist told me about the ""immunity"" risk... I'm a bit shook to find out about problems no one cared explaining me before? I might be wrong though if they did told me but because I was feeling bad just after my diagnosis I just forgot it all but, I mean, shouldn't serious issues like this be repeated from time to time as a reminder? I'll have a talk about it with my endo next time I'll see her obviously, should be helping me at least a bit!"
