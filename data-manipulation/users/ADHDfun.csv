We discussed beating your wife in the Koran, he told me that it wasn't true and he had the whole Koran memorized. He said how Islam elevated women, I asked him how that was possible when Khadija inherited property from her father, I asked him how it was possible that women never inherited property before Islam. He had no answer, and told me I didn't know anything and that he as a Muslim knows more about his religion than I do. I said that I had done my research and had read part of the Koran too. I told her later in private that she should not marry an active Muslim. I said I'm sure that the guy is fine, but it's better not to take the chance because of how much power husbands have over their wives in Islam. She later stopped being my friend, and said I had hate in my heart. All this over a religious discussion! She accused me of being a white supremacist which I found completely ludicrous, because all I told her was not to marry a Muslim.  We have mutual friends that are not white, and I have dated many guys who are not white. She is not a Muslim and knows nothing about it  and thinks it's just like any other religion. \*shrug\* Whatever... I know Christian women who married Muslims and are completely miserable.

Libraries,feni1wx,t3_ep4vzy,1579285141.0,"I would say don't do it. I am 30 and thinking of leaving the profession. I am a library technician, and MLIS people are stealing OUR limited jobs which pay $22-28/h part time because there are so few librarian jobs.

There was a part time job posting for a bilingual library technician with programming experience, and they wanted someone with elementary school library experience.

I have programming experience, I have worked in a high school, a college, a bilingual elementary school library in the language they wanted me to be bilingual in, a public library, and a library system. I am bilingual and I have the necessary education for libraries,(I am a library technician) and I have a certificate in early learning and childcare. I thought I was a shoe in. I didn't even get an interview.

So there you go.  It's highly competitive and the few jobs that are available are usually part-time. If you want to make the investment for a masters degree and get a part-time tech job that pays $25-28/h then go for it! The techs that I know are all kind of pissed about this phenomena because most of us can't find jobs. I have one because I am bilingual.  I am the only person that works in a French immersion elementary school library, that has almost 600 students, and I have only 27.5 hours a week. They are most likely cutting my hours next year. I have worked here for 5 years and I make $28.10/h I'm at the top of the grid. There are other techs who say they would kill to have my job so apparently my job is one of the better ones.

She was a nun and there is one story of her not liking one of the other nuns at the convent but she was so kind to this nun that one day  the disliked nun said ""I don't know why Therese likes me so much but I think she likes me more than other people because she is always particularily kind to me.""

I had people at school that I was friendly with, but none of them were really friends to the point where we did stuff together outside of school. In junior high, and elementary I had more of a social life than I did in high school which is kind of sad. I also never had any boyfriends.

FundieSnark,feesequ,t1_feemoqb,1579040208.0,"Putting your marriage over your child doesn't mean you don't love your child. It's not even loving your child less than your spouse. It means prioritizing your spouse for your children's sake. 

I believe that being a good parent means doing everything in your power to make sure that they will have a good childhood before it's born. It's picking a good spouse, it's having a career, it's having a stable life. 
If you picked a good spouse and you have a child together, then yes the marriage should come first.  without a strong marriage and loving home, kids won’t thrive, so you’re doing them a disservice by putting your spouse on the back burner, which can lead to marital trouble and even divorce.

Life isn't black and white, and kids CAN thrive in a divorced household but it causes some upheaval, sadness, and it makes their lives a little less stable due to changing households all the time etc. Divorced kids don't get to see their parents as often as they may like etc. Holidays can be a headache.

NOTE: It also helps that my sisters have never rubbed any of this in my face. We all know the truth, but we never acknowledge it unless I make the occasional self deprecating joke. But I have learned not to do that too often, because it makes people feel uncomfortable. Mainly because it rings a little too close to the truth.

I learned that men are the only ones who can make self deprecating jokes. When women do it, people feel like it's pathetic or that you're ""fishing for compliments""  It's really not fair, because a lot of humour is self deprecating."

They were all on the sports teams, and I wasn't. They went to all the parties, and I didn't. They made straight As, and I didn't I was more of a C student. They played musical instruments at a high level, and I didn't.  As of now they make more money than I do. (Like WAY more money. think 100k vs 30k.) They go on holidays that I can't even dream about.

I STILL want what is best for ALL of my sisters. I never want them to go through any hardships. I LOVE my sisters. Growing up it was a little hard to always be compared to them, and always having to lose out but it doesn't matter. When they accomplish something I am proud of them. When they go through a hard time, I feel their pain and I want it to stop.

If that's the case for Birthy, I still think she is a bad person. At the end of the day your sister is your sister. It doesn't matter if they are smarter, prettier or just all around more talented and successful. Your sister is your sister. Period.

My guess would be that they have an 8th grade education at best."
FundieSnark,fb5q47l,t1_fb58nhx,1576532273.0,"I know many pro life people that are pro vaccination. My parents being 2 of them. They are not ""pro life"" as in many ""pro-lifers"" and actually care about the welfare of the mother and child both pre and post birth. They give generously to organizations that help vulnerable pregnant women, to women's shelters and vote for policies that would help women in these situations. They are also pro birth control and pro sex education. I have also only ever heard them express empathy for single parents of any kind never criticism for ""having children out of wedlock"" etc. They are also anti-death penalty and anti-war. They believe that women getting an education is even more important than men getting one because education empowers our most vulnerable members of our society."
