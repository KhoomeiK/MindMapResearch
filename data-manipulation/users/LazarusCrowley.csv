I am a certified alcohol and other drug counselor, level II, from the CCAPP.

I have many years of listening to people tell me how dumb I am because, ""Cobain was a fucking rebel man, he shot himself, fuck the world, Iam edgy, I braid my armpit hair"". Or whatever the fuck that makes you, ""unique"". 

You are not. Those people were not, rather, the people in the 27 club, the tortured artist, your Winehouse's, Cobain's and Joplins were not. 

I mean, they were unique, as individuals and people. They were awesome as artist and creators. They were also mentally ill. They died because they made poor decisions and had issues left untreated. 

Phillip Seymore Hoffman did his best work sober. So did RDJ.

People like Natalie Portman are practical saints and wicked weird and awesome.

Paul Rudd drinks a little too much but he is basically an alright guy.

Hugh Jackman is an absolute Gem. 

List goes on."

In the substance abuse world, often did I hear someone, including myself when I was younger, lament about the 27 club. How struggling and hardship and worry, sickness and death make you better and more, ""artistic"".

rareinsults,feoy2bs,t1_feow3x2,1579307875.0,"Totally. 

Following the whole thread though, I was responding to a response about Joaquin Phoenix having seen his brother die and thusly was a better artist.

I do not agree, necessarily."
rareinsults,feoxw2b,t1_feoq9j9,1579307767.0,"I hear you. However, I'd contend that the majority of the folks you hung around with (massive assumption) were not r ew ally all that talented or artistic.

I'd say you probably saw a lot of folks who think that drugs, depression and a lack of self-awareness as some stairway to stardom. 

I can't be sure but managing one artist on some label somewhere does not make an expert."
rareinsults,feon358,t1_fenzsiy,1579302491.0,"This is an unsubstantiated trope. 

You just happen to hear about the salacious ones because it is provocative. 

Poor mental health =/= artistic ability. I'm really sick of seeing the whole - drugs, tragedy and weirdness creates great artistic endeavor.

Not aimed at you OP just struck a chord. 

I'd say most people who are extremely talented and or artistic are *genuine* people, those authentic to themselves."

excgarated,felfmab,t1_feldiwt,1579221031.0,"Yeah, that's was my point about the difference between a fairly common, albeit hard to spell word, ""necessarily"" vs. ""Yarmulke"" which is uncommon, spelled absolutely nutso, and also foreign.

They're not even phonetically that accurate. Lol."

I can't spell necessarily without auto-correct. JFC, it's not like the word he was trying to spell is yarmulke."

I'm not sure what exactly your are asking me to tell you. 

Do you want my personal experience? Do you want me to rummage through the internet and find what specifically the USA does or specific states do to encourage critical thinking in public schools k - 12? Do you want me to gather a rabble and run through the streets of your city, describing how, I, Laz, learned to think critically in school?

Just because you *italicize* something does not mean you have a point.

From what I see, it's the generation, born and educated immediately and shortly after WW2 that run the media and CNN.

Give me an ever loving break with that ish. People are stupid and will always be stupid. 

Critical thinking can be taught, for sure. Wrestling can be taught , for sure. Do neither and see that they both fall to disuse. However, if returned too after a long hiatus, you too can remember how to blow me again.

Reddit is great **because** people just spout off, dont use facts, use their opinions to make terrible conclusions.
