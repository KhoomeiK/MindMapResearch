financialindependence,ffpcuxb,t3_eug3bk,1580091869.0,"From an early age I forced myself to distinguish what society (others) want me to want and what I actually want.

I test drove expensive cars and realized, as top gear famously said, ""a car becomes fun at the limits of its capabilities."" I love my manual economy car more than I loved driving $75,000 sports cars, because it's a joy to drive. You would have to break a lot of laws to push a sports car to its limits. 

I had to move out just because it's no longer socially acceptable for me to live at home at my age, and when I did I bought a small townhome. It's what I was comfortable affording after living at home and pinching pennies for years, even though my entire family expected me to buy a house because they dont understand the state of things (still think everything is as it was when they were my age, show up to work and get trained by your employer then retire a millionaire after 30 years ez pz). Its important to know what you can afford while still saving and going with that rather than going with what will appease others. I chose a place that is small but I am happy with and am finally enjoying my autonomy.

I'll be able to save a bit but arent poised to RE unless I increase my income. That's the goal and the hope. Regardless, I have built the life I want. I dont have a nice car or a big house or whatever else people buy that doesnt actually increase their happiness. I have a nice computer that I enjoy and a decent stereo that i can relax and listen to in the morning while i sip good coffee. It's not what everyone would want but its *my* life and I built it for *me* and now I have locked in my expenses buying only things that please *me* and no one else."

I have tried a couple others, this one is great for the price for games, reading is slightly worse than others due to the weird anti SDE lens, which sacrifices sharpness of text for attractiveness of 3d environments, to put it simply. I have enjoyed games on this very much, and the lack of sharpness of text has not hampered my ability to read text in skyrim vr. It only makes reading in virtual desktop and a few other cases, like the placards in the environments you can visit in steam vr (which are really cool, the text talks about details, history, and the technical side as to how the scenes were created)

Glasses pressed into my face when I wore them under the mask, and rubbed on the lenses, which in time can leave permanent smudges on both the lenses and your glasses if you have plastic lenses. I recommend getting lens inserts, which has drastically increased the comfort of the experience. There are a few sources for these, let me know if you want links. They cost around $100. 

Overall comfort is fine, I usually get sweaty (lenses start getting foggy too) and/or need a break before it gets uncomfortable. The headset doesnt sit right on my face if I put the head strap behind my head, I usually angle it up and put it basically halfway between the top and back of my head, which ensures a good seal on the bottom of the headset and prevents light leak."
