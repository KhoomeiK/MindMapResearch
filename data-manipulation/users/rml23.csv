That's just factually unsound. By your logic there isn't any murder in the US because I've never witnessed one.

You conveniently disregarded my other point. If a country's government isn't hostile towards the reason someone if fleeing, its appropriate for asylum. Having double the crime rate as the US has nothing to do with its suitability. I don't think you fully understand asylum. 

>We would be allowed to shower and sleep in an actual bed in a room with enough space to move though, so...

They do have beds and showers. Stop exaggerating. When illegal immigrants are first picked up and brought in for processing, that's where those pictures come from with people sleeping on mats. Have you ever been arrested? Newsflash: There are no beds while you're being held. 

>That's absolute untrue. We shouldn't stop helping people who need us because people in charge suck. The governor of Puerto Rico is an excellent example; those people are American citizens who are suffering because of fucked logic like yours.

Jesus. The money isn't being used to help the people. Corrupt officials tend to do that. They need to prove they are using it for the people if we're going to keep sending it. And the Puerto Ricans are suffering because their officials are inept i.e. warehouse full of supplies that was never distributed.

>They already were before the zero-tolerance policy and they were still decreasing. There's zero reason to prosecute it the way we do. It's a waste of resources, worsens the backlog, and puts government money in the hands of the private facilities overcharging for gulag-level accommodations. 

Technically, no. Even though they were decreasing, there was still a problematic amount of people trying to illegally enter. Shut up about gulags- you have no idea what you're talking about. 

>Why? We already pay for when they wait and end up in the emergency room. 

Do you want another 4 years of Trump, because this is how you're going to get it. American taxpayers shouldn't pay for their care, including in the ER. All the more reason to deter those trying to sneak into our country.

You still haven't presented any actual solution. I'm starting to think you're full of shit.

Oh please. White supremacists, gestapo, concentration camps! People have lost their damn minds. My solution is to detain people when they enter the country illegal and deport them after a hearing, just like every other friggin country does. Try using your head. Didnt your mom ever tell you we can adopt every dog at the pound. This next election is going to be a clusterfuck. I guess I'll sit out again because even though I can't vote for Trump, I refuse to vote for one of these progressive twats. Don't bother responding, I've had enough of this little game."
politics,fguifef,t1_fgucru0,1581121596.0,">Costa Rica has almost double the US's crime rate, your personal experience is kinda moot, tbh. Belize and Mexico both have tons more murders.

Crime had nothing to do with the adequacy of a country for asylum. For example, if Honduras' Government was persecuting someone for a certain Religion and the Costa Rican Government was welcoming of that Religion, it would be a suitable place to apply for asylum. If a gringo like me can backpack off the beaten path for a couple months, then it's fine for Asylum seekers. Same goes for Mexico. It's a huge country and the cartels only operate in certain areas. Furthermore, the economy is doing better now and more Mexicans are deciding to stay.

>Maybe if economic migration didn't take potential decades to achieve here less people would use it? And you can speculate all you want but that doesn't change the fact that they're coming here and we shouldn't be dicks to them. 

So you agree asylum fraud is going on... We take in 1,000,000 immigrants a year. Maybe other countries should do the same? Detaining migrants is not being a dick. We would be detained if we illegal crossed into Canada.

>Why not? There are more poor babies born than immigrants by orders of magnitude. Or senior citizens qualifying for Medicare and Social Security. We passed a bloated 800 billion dollar defense budget last year. The money exists and the jobs exist too. And not everyone who shows up would even be let in in the first place depending on how their hearings go or if they make it all the way through the immigration process. We naturalized over 700,000 people in 2018 with no problem. 

It's sad, I know, but all countries have immigration limits. As it is now, we take in more than any other country. I'm not sure you're correct about available jobs. These arent exactly skilled workers and with automation, there are going to be less Jobs in the future. Let's focus on needy Americans first, specifically the homeless and those on welfare, before we talk about an immigration increase.

>Corruption's a problem but we literally held their aid hostage last year, so we're not much better.

Nonetheless, those countries need to get their act together. If the money isn't being used properly and corrupt officials are stealing it, we should stop all aid.

>I never said we shouldn't have that. But detaining them indefinitely, separating their families, and forcing them into untenable conditions when we could fix our system to better accommodate the volume of people (which again, decreases every year) just feels unnecessarily cruel. I'm not suggesting we have open borders or grant blanket amnesty but there has to be some middle ground. And just saying my ideas are stupid without offering any kind of actual solution is just disingenuous. 

We arent detaining them indefinitely, however they are detained longer than the last Administration since we stopped catch and release and there is a backlog in court. Back to the article here, I disagree with Bernie on immigration. Illegal border crossings should not be decriminalized. Although we're at a 20 year low, there are still xxx,xxx people coming each year. That's alot! And he wants to give illegal immigrants healthcare? Unbelievable. 

>Over 90% of those in the ankle monitor program. How is it horrible?

ICE spokesman Matthew Bourke said immigration court attendance is strong for immigrants in intensive supervision, but that ankle monitors and other measures are “not an effective tool” after deportation orders are issued. There isn’t reliable information on the number of ankle monitor recipients who remove them and flee, but many say it’s high."

I guess I was thinking of Europe, where Asylum shopping is illegal. To say there are no safe countries between here and Central America is ridiculous. What about Costa Rica? I backpacked through that country for months and never felt in danger. Belize? A tourist destination...And Mexico is a huge country, so of course they could find a safe haven there as well. It's almost like people are using asylum as cover for economic migration? What are so many people being persecuted for? Violence and poverty in general are not grounds for asylum. I empathize with these people, but we simply can't take in every person who wants to come here.

>That would be all well and good, but they can already do that. The problem is that they find it so dangerous to remain there and wait god knows how long for a response, let alone an accepted application, that making the journey is the easier choice

Again, dangerous conditions in general are not grounds for asylum. Asylum is for people who are being persecuted for race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. 

>Giving illegals a path to citizenship (complete with some kind of reasonable fine and/or probation) would also help quash the issue. Given that there's literally nothing we can do to stop it from happening outright we might as well not be dicks about it. Oh, and investing in the betterment of their home countries could probably help too.

I'm all for allowing a path to citizenship for those that have been in our country for a certain amount if time, have no criminal record and won't rely on the Government for financial assistance, but we can't do that for every single migrant who shows up at the border. No country on earth does that and all nations have immigration limits. As for investing in betterment of those countries, we do, but corruption leads to the money not being spent how it should.

Listen, I'm not trying to be harsh, just practical about the situation. I'm trying to look at this issue without Political lenses on. I'm the son of an immigrant and welcome those who want to come here, but we're allowed to have rules, limits and to enforce our border when people cross illegally. Ankle monitors are a horrible idea and as I already mentioned, in the last 5 years or so, only 60-75% of non detained migrants showed up for court. That's alot of accounted people."

If there weren't so many coming anually, I would agree with the anklemonitirs, but that's not the case.

Let me guess, hunting rifles and shotguns only? Sorry, but that's not going go fly. This would be unpopular on both sides of the aisle.

It's the Right to Bear Arms, not the Need. Its no  ones business how many guns someone owns, as long as they are properly secured. And to answer your question, most guns on the black market are either stolen or purchased by straw buyers. 

Who's calling for Amending 2A? Nobody. And I explained before how difficult Constitutional Amendments are. 2/3 of Congress would have to agree along with a certain number of States. It's not plausible and would not be supported. 

What happens when people refuse to turn in their guns? Would the cops start kicking in doors? There would absolutely be mass noncompliance. We saw this in New Jersey when any magazines over 10 rounds were banned. No one turned them in. Or how about when New York required semi auto rifles to be registered? The majority of people said no. Personally, I will never forcibly turn in my personal property."

I said universal background checks, which would involve gun shows and private sales. Even Gun Orgs such as the Brady Campaign Against Gun Violence have moved away from suggesting we ban guns, instead focusing in saftey and other measures that can reduce gun deaths. Same with Gabriel Giffords. Her husband owns the same gun she was shot with and is not calling for their ban. She even enjoys shooting herself.

>Throwing people in prison just racks up taxes as I already pointed out and because the prison system is absolutely shit, it does nothing for rehabilitation so they’re almost guaranteed to come out and do it again if they are gang related.

So we shouldn't send violent criminals to jail? Heres an idea. Stop incarcerating non violent drug offenders and focus on violent criminals. With Mandatory sentencing, they will be off the street for a long time. Reoffend? Well, repeat offenders go away for even longer.

>Me being downvoted by 5-10 people isn’t you in a majority. 

As I said before, only 21% of Americans want the 2nd Amendment repealed. Many want AR style weapons outlawed, but current ownership will be grandfathered in. And no one is calling for handguns to be banned. 

>Support for stricter gun laws grows every year because people are getting sick of this crap and it’s not a pipe dream.

Violent crime with firearms are at an all time low. I never said gun laws won't evolve - I believe they will, but mass confiscation is definitely a pipe dream. Seriously, who is calling for that? No Politicians as far as I know and most Americans are against it as well.

That in my book is borderline full gun ban, as semi automatics are the most owned gun. Owning these types of guns is hardly absurdly unnecessary. That is merely a flawed opinion. I'm open to more gun control, such as red flag laws, banning ownership for domestic abusers, minimum mandatory sentencing for illegal posession and universal background checks, so no, I'm not foaming at the mouth and am open to compromise, others are not. You're wrong here on so many levels. Enjoy your little pipe dream because what your striving for is never going to happen. Perhaps you should move to Japan?"

Let's not jump the gun here, pun intended. Buy backs, I mean mandatory confiscation, won't happen without the unlikely Constitutional Amendment. We are not other countries. Australia's Ambassador to the United States even acknowledged it's not a model that would work in America. If it was Beto O'Rourke would be our nominee, yet he dropped out months ago. 

Yes, if you're in posession of an illegal firearm, you belong in prison, especially considering gang violence is the leading cause of mass shootings!! Seems you want to punish law abiding Americans and not the people are are actually responsible for the carnage. It's not a deterrent because those caught with guns are often not punished appropriately. I see all the time. These judges courtrooms are simply a revolving door for offenders, who only receive a slap on the wrist.

Your idea of reasonable is not the definition held by the majority of Americans. Only about 21 percent said in a poll they would back a complete or full repeal of the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 

Your parroting routine and pissy attitude is ending this conversation. Complain all you want, but our guns arent going anywhere and your extreme stance is only hurting the cause.

No it's not a stupid argument. The Constitution is the law of the land and our representatives took an oath to uphold and protect it.

We don't have daily mass shootings. The numbers are inflated and mostly take place in a handful of cities. Dare I say we should combat gang violence and crack down on those in posession of an illegal firearm? How about 25 years mandatory sentence, no parole?
