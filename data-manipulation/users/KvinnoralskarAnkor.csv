todayilearned,ffgufsp,t1_ffgh22w,1579915343.0,"Those cops were using the civilians as literal shields. The ships are traveling as part of the convoy with civilians because of the noise pollution so a submarine cannot get a clear picture of the carrier group. The point of this is that a submarine is not designed for a straight up fight with any other ship except submarines, so they would be far less likely to strike because A. they've now revealed themselves to an enemy that can and will hunt them down, and B. they've created an international incident that turns public support against them. There is no benefit to risking that kind of strike when it's a war between two nations. 

Next, let's look at trade. Let's say it's an enemy who wants to disrupt trade, especially of arms and supplies. A civilian ship carrying military goods is a fantastic target. Unlike the police situation, where the police's actions put more risk to the people they were using as shields (because now the person is involved when they had no reason to be at all), a carrier group being with merchant ships provides protection that wouldn't exist otherwise. A civilian ship cannot protect itself against a submarine. A carrier group can, and with the noise pollution, the submarine would have to guarantee a blow that kills the civilian ship and response from the carrier group. Which just isn't possible. Did the torpedoes hit the right ships? Did they do enough damage? With the noise pollution and the tides, and all the other factors, there isn't a tactical benefit to making that attack. 

So, tl;dr, military ships gain camouflage, civilian ships gain protection they didn't have otherwise, and the enemy submarine is to scared of retaliation to want to attempt it. In biology terms, a mutualistic relationship, not a parasitic like the cops who used civilians as shields."
todayilearned,ffgcjjo,t1_ffg0n12,1579903220.0,"Well, teaching officers how to run a perfect operation isn't how it really goes down. Look at the Bin Laden raid. In a war game scenario, the helicopter going down would be a reset. However, in the real world, mission still has to go on. 

Or look at Audie Murphy. Shit hit the fan and would have been a reset situation, but he took a shit situation and repelled a German attack while on a burning half track. 

There is no situation where it goes as planned in real combat, and the general was probably pissed because of this. Instead of teaching to think and adapt, it's teaching how to run drills. Arguably drilling officers into a routine where they just act on reflex is a decent idea, but rigid adherence to doctrine is also a good way to wind up flat footed when things go sideways. Throwing a curve ball at officers when it's a zero risk situation is better than having an officer cadre who will balk when given a situation that couldn't be prepared for (see: actual combat). Robin Sage teaches this. Ranger school is by and large about making sure that it's students can keep thinking even under the harshest conditions. Even boot camp is about getting the recruits into a place where they just do instead of thinking.  

Why should they stop training for what it's actually like when it gets to the strategic level? Hell, have half the scenarios be ""walk throughs"" and then have the other half be a competitive thing with a degree of randomness. Communication delays happen, weather happens, casualties happen, enemies do weird shit, why wouldn't we add this to the training program?"

Unless you and your family somehow got an education at 1300 different schools in the US, you have experience with less than 1% of the schools in the US. There's a lot of variance between these schools, and even within the schools themselves. I had an amazing teacher one period, the next, someone who was just waiting to collect their pension. The US education system is largely decided by wealth within the district, and it's stupid.

Which leaves no room for ambiguity of compromising ones morals for a greater good. You finally addressed my concern, good job. All it took was you reading what I said instead of getting pissy that I can't read your mind. 

I have an issue with the lack of ambiguity purely because of the sheer amount of absolutism that infects politics. It's a cancer. My perspective is colored by years of seeing it. 

Damn, I must've hurt your feelings if you really try to make a pathetic snipe like that.

And again, because you don't even remember what you said  you don't trust politicians who have been there because they've compromised their morals or what they believe in. Fair. But my point has been that sometimes that is more damaging to the average person, and it's not automatically a good thing to do. Multiple times now you've missed that. And I'm in the same camp as you. I agree that politicians are too corrupt.

Because as far as I can tell, you think it's never compromising your beliefs and never going against what you say, and that's such an idealistic view of it that I'm pretty sure you've never made a hard choice in your life. 

Integrity is more than that. It's knowing when your actions may be causing more harm than good and reevaluating. It's owning what you've done. So, for example, I can get healthcare for everyone, but I'd also have to vote that abortion isn't federally protected. If we go with your version of integrity, I say ""no, I refuse"". Nothing changes, millions of Americans continue to go into debt. But I can pat myself on the back and say ""well at least I didn't compromise my morals"".  Or I can help those millions and admit why. And then promise to ensure that my mistake is fixed. 

Or let's get more extreme. In the Balkans, in the 90s, let's say I have a family. The war has made food scarce. I can steal food or starve. Well, I'm firmly anti theft. So I'll starve and my family will starve, but I can comfort my aching belly by saying ""at least I didn't steal"". Or I'll steal and make sure my family doesn't starve. 

Many, many, MANY people view integrity like you. It's very black and white, and has led to further division because people don't want to think that maybe it's not as simple as you make it to be. You gave the most textbook definition of integrity, and then expect it to hold up to the complexities of humanity. That's not helping anyone. And your version of it allows suffering to occur, but gives a free pass to those who could stop it because ""they didn't compromise what they believed in"".

I used Free Speech, because, again, *YOU* brought it up. You cannot just say ""but that wasn't my main point so clearly you just want to fight"". Give people a justification to hate net neutrality, and they'll gladly justify it being taken away. The point, which you keep missing because you think *disagreement* is looking for a fight, is that you're hyping it up as if people care. They don't. Give them one good reason and they'll piss away any protections they had. 

And, you brought up the alt right. Why? I was pointing out that people will mock anyone who says free speech, alt right, liberal, soc dem, whatever. Which further proves my point. I made an argument about free speech and your first reaction was ""alt right"". You ignored it all to say ""the alt right is mad about consequences for their words"".

Which equates women's rights of today to the Suffrage movement, the current income inequality to the Great Depression (of the 30s), and the Iran situation to Nazi Germany (another slight miss in timeline). I'm beginning to wonder if you ignore issues when you agree with the overall message. 

So I'm not to bothered by someone saying ""it's better now than then"". Because it is. It factually is, and anyone equating today to yesteryear should have it thrown in their face. Check your goddamn privilege. 

As well, and I know this is hard to believe, WE FUCKING KNOW THERE ARE ISSUES. A slightly more creative ""it's X, we're supposed to be better than that"" isn't worth hearing or making or discussing anymore. Racism is an issue. Sexism is an issue. Income inequality is an issue. Just saying it isn't a profound or deep thing. It's just recycled at this point, and hey, recycling is great for the planet, but not for political commentary.  This entire website is full of political discussion about how awful everything is right now. About how it's so fuckin miserable to be alive, and if you just want a break from hearing another tired talking point, again and again and again on every subreddit, you're told to deal with it even though you already agree and just want to read some funny comments because you had a long day and want to relax. 

Gee, I wonder why people might want to change the subject. And even then, it's still a roller coaster of what even matters. Remember China, putting people in camps. Forced sterilization and everything? Hong Kong is falling on the wayside too. Camps at the border. This shit isn't going to matter tomorrow. We drive these topics into the ground. People get compassion fatigue, stop caring, and then when they say as much, people jump down their throat over it. Despite the fact that in a few days it won't matter to them either because we're so flooded with information we're effectively inoculated against giving a shit. 

In WW1 and 2, and pretty much every war before them, soldiers were on campaign till war was over. They got rotated from the front, but they didn't go home to their families. ""Until the job is done"". Soldiers got worn out. They got tired. They stopped being effective. They stopped giving a shit. In response, militaries began a system of deployments where they were there for X time and then rotated home so they could recover. The same thing is happening when it comes to social justice. People are tired. When I was a kid, gay people couldn't get married. Now they can. It's lovely. But once it happened, there wasn't any time to celebrate it or appreciate how far we've come. Just immediately to the next issue. Non stop.

 A win doesn't matter, and it's starting to wear on people. Hell, I used to way more politically engaged. I used to respond whenever I could, whether I disagreed or just wanted to show support. Now, I just don't see a point most of the time, and I'm happier for it. Less shit is slung at me, I don't have issues constantly banging around in my head. Life's grand. I'm only 25. Imagine people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s. They've seen a lot of social upheaval and seen a lot worse. Dealt with a lot worse. My mom made it in a male dominated field in the 80s and 90s. She doesn't like the new wave of feminists, because ""most of the things they complain about is their own hang ups"". 

So why do you think this line of rhetoric your defending, and condemning others for having an issue with, will fly with them or anyone else? At the end of the day, it's not about pointing out issues that still exist. They've been there for a long time, and we've known they exist for awhile. Instead of defending mindless slacktavism (""raising awareness""), champion discussion to solve issues. Instead of saying ""quit implying we should ignore it"" say ""well what can we do to make sure we stop having these issues"". Problem solving 101. You still have fire and passion for it.

If you think you're a professional educator, you're wrong. I was constantly bored in class despite the constant stream of work they threw at me.

What's worse, is that millions of kids' education suffers and their love of learning dies off because of educators such as yourself, who think that learning is about sitting in the seat and doing more work and more work and more work. For you, and kids like you were, sure. That's fine. But to me, and to kids who are like me, that's torture.

Being hungry does suck, but severity does actually matter when discussing things like this. 

They just said ""things are better now"". That's it. Not, ""things are better, stop complaining"". Not ""it's perfect now"". Just that things are better. They are. No, they're not perfect, but that doesn't mean we get to equate the problems of today to the problems of yesterday because shit isn't perfect yet. It's disrespectful for one, and it also gives the impression there's no end goal other than true equality in a world where true equality varies from movement to movement and person to person. Equality of outcome, equality of opportunity, equality through retribution, and so many more.

It isn't necessarily against hateful speech, that's just the modern version of it. But Hitler did practice a version of it. So did Stalin. Which, makes sense. Communism isn't just Marxism, there's so many different flavors of it that a communist revolution will have so many different players with wildly different views. So why does the discussion rely on political correctness only having one use? Should communism be debated by Leninism? Maoism? Stalinism? Should nihilism only be debated by edgy twats who believe that nothing mattering means they can act like twats? 

I'm not the other guy, but he's not really wrong. It's just that Political Correctness as a concept isn't just ""stand against hateful speech"". It's ""what is the correct political stance"", and historically, people who stepped out from that stance were persecuted, and arguably, that's a reason to be concerned. Especially when we have examples of perceived slights causing real harm. 

Free society has no business saying what is and isn't okay to believe. People shouldn't be punished for believing in something stupid or wrong or ""wrong"". They should be debated, and when it comes to racism, xenophobia, or any other hateful belief, debate it's not hard to win. Before the age old strawman of ""sO wE sHoUlD iGnOrE iT?"" comes up, no. Debate words and ideas, punish actions that are wrong. Bigots get a hard on for shit like the post or someone getting fired for saying ""niggardly"" because they can use it as an example of political correctness gone wrong.

Integrity is more than that. It's knowing when your actions may be causing more harm than good and reevaluating. It's owning what you've done. So, for example, I can get healthcare for everyone, but I'd also have to vote that abortion isn't federally protected. If we go with your version of integrity, I say ""no, I refuse"".

And once the import of slaves was banned, the breeding of slaves (that feels dirty to say about humans) just caused a wanton mix of African cultures that even if they had been allowed to keep their culture, was so muddled that it would look nothing like the culture they had in Africa. 

But, what to do after that? We naturally develop cultures with what we have and what we know. It's why Europeans mock the US so much. They have to feel superior or they can't sleep at night, and they can't invade a country full of potential victims anymore. It's why the US is so cocky and hawkish, we haven't, in living memory, seen the true horrors of war since in the past 120 years, war has been some far off problem and we haven't really had to deal with a true loss of a war (yes Vietnam, but we didn't really suffer from that).

I used Free Speech, because, again, *YOU* brought it up. You cannot just say ""but that wasn't my main point so clearly you just want to fight"". Give people a justification to hate net neutrality, and they'll gladly justify it being taken away. The point, which you keep missing because you think *disagreement* is looking for a fight, is that you're hyping it up as if people care. They don't. Give them one good reason and they'll piss away any protections they had. 

And, you brought up the alt right. Why? I was pointing out that people will mock anyone who says free speech, alt right, liberal, soc dem, whatever. Which further proves my point. I made an argument about free speech and your first reaction was ""alt right"". You ignored it all to say ""the alt right is mad about consequences for their words"". As if that makes it okay for cancel culture to exist in general.  

I wasn't spoiling for a fight, I was disagreeing with ONE aspect of your comment. Now though? Yeah, I wanna fight, since you clearly can't handle anything other than someone saying ""yeah, you go, you're so right"".

It was just a thinly veiled ""it's 2020, we shouldn't have X"". It literally says ""like women should be fighting for their rights, the rich are living hedonistic lifestyles while the poor suffer, and on the brink of war"". Which equates women's rights of today to the Suffrage movement, the current income inequality to the Great Depression (of the 30s), and the Iran situation to Nazi Germany (another slight miss in timeline). I'm beginning to wonder if you ignore issues when you agree with the overall message. 

So I'm not to bothered by someone saying ""it's better now than then"". Because it is. It factually is, and anyone equating today to yesteryear should have it thrown in their face. Check your goddamn privilege. 

As well, and I know this is hard to believe, WE FUCKING KNOW THERE ARE ISSUES. A slightly more creative ""it's X, we're supposed to be better than that"" isn't worth hearing or making or discussing anymore. Racism is an issue. Sexism is an issue. Income inequality is an issue. Just saying it isn't a profound or deep thing. It's just recycled at this point, and hey, recycling is great for the planet, but not for political commentary.  This entire website is full of political discussion about how awful everything is right now. About how it's so fuckin miserable to be alive, and if you just want a break from hearing another tired talking point, again and again and again on every subreddit, you're told to deal with it even though you already agree and just want to read some funny comments because you had a long day and want to relax. 

Gee, I wonder why people might want to change the subject. And even then, it's still a roller coaster of what even matters. Remember China, putting people in camps. Forced sterilization and everything? Hong Kong is falling on the wayside too. Camps at the border. This shit isn't going to matter tomorrow. We drive these topics into the ground. People get compassion fatigue, stop caring, and then when they say as much, people jump down their throat over it. Despite the fact that in a few days it won't matter to them either because we're so flooded with information we're effectively inoculated against giving a shit. 

In WW1 and 2, and pretty much every war before them, soldiers were on campaign till war was over. They got rotated from the front, but they didn't go home to their families. ""Until the job is done"". Soldiers got worn out. They got tired. They stopped being effective. They stopped giving a shit. In response, militaries began a system of deployments where they were there for X time and then rotated home so they could recover. The same thing is happening when it comes to social justice. People are tired. When I was a kid, gay people couldn't get married. Now they can. It's lovely. But once it happened, there wasn't any time to celebrate it or appreciate how far we've come. Just immediately to the next issue. Non stop.

 A win doesn't matter, and it's starting to wear on people. Hell, I used to way more politically engaged. I used to respond whenever I could, whether I disagreed or just wanted to show support. Now, I just don't see a point most of the time, and I'm happier for it. Less shit is slung at me, I don't have issues constantly banging around in my head. Life's grand. I'm only 25. Imagine people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s. They've seen a lot of social upheaval and seen a lot worse. Dealt with a lot worse. My mom made it in a male dominated field in the 80s and 90s. She doesn't like the new wave of feminists, because ""most of the things they complain about is their own hang ups"". 

So why do you think this line of rhetoric your defending, and condemning others for having an issue with, will fly with them or anyone else? At the end of the day, it's not about pointing out issues that still exist. They've been there for a long time, and we've known they exist for awhile. Instead of defending mindless slacktavism (""raising awareness""), champion discussion to solve issues. Instead of saying ""quit implying we should ignore it"" say ""well what can we do to make sure we stop having these issues"". Problem solving 101. You still have fire and passion for it. Use it to do something that millions of others aren't already jerking themselves off for."
todayilearned,fcz55dh,t1_fcz14ll,1578093872.0,"Or, and this might be wild, each kid is different and you should factor that in. Some kids want to help their peers, and by having to break it down in their head to explain it, will learn it better. Other kids want to be given more practice. That's fine, have the option there. 

If you think you're a professional educator, you're wrong. I was constantly bored in class despite the constant stream of work they threw at me. I wanted to socialize, I wanted to help others learn new things like I just did. But because the teacher took your view of education, I was forced to sit quietly, being ""rewarded"" with more work. Then the stream of standardized tests, and they kept piling those fuckers on, and teaching to it via PILING MORE AND MORE WORK ON. 

What's lazy teaching is treating each kid the same way and expecting them to get it despite the fact that it's pretty common knowledge that there's auditory, tactile, and visual learners amongst every class. What's worse, is that millions of kids' education suffers and their love of learning dies off because of educators such as yourself, who think that learning is about sitting in the seat and doing more work and more work and more work. For you, and kids like you were, sure. That's fine. But to me, and to kids who are like me, that's torture. It's miserable, and this cookie cutter approach needs to stop being pushed by educational ""professionals""."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fcz0wdu,t1_fcyws4y,1578091437.0,"Well, the actual post compares issues today as if they're exactly the same as 100 years ago. Which, I'm sorry, is just not the case. It's like a rich person crying about missing a meal to a poor person who hasn't eaten in two days because they can't afford it. Being hungry does suck, but severity does actually matter when discussing things like this. 

They just said ""things are better now"". That's it. Not, ""things are better, stop complaining"". Not ""it's perfect now"". Just that things are better. They are. No, they're not perfect, but that doesn't mean we get to equate the problems of today to the problems of yesterday because shit isn't perfect yet. It's disrespectful for one, and it also gives the impression there's no end goal other than true equality in a world where true equality varies from movement to movement and person to person. Equality of outcome, equality of opportunity, equality through retribution, and so many more. 

People need a win every once in awhile. Let people have ""we're better now"" when someone equates today's issues to 100 years ago. It's really a shitty hill to die on when you're assuming a lot about what the person means off 1 sentence."

Culture, yeah you can. Irish culture isn't so mired in mystery that you can't learn it, especially living there. 

And you won't have a full on accent, but you'll have a bit of one due to the fact that humans adjust the way we talk to fit in better. 

Quit whinging about it, and do something about it. I wish I was born in Sweden or Scotland, but I wasn't. We all have to make the best of what we have, and you're not stuck in abject poverty, afflicted by disease, or worried about the neighboring tribe coming and stealing your shit. 

Get qualified for a job and then move to Ireland."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fcym1bl,t1_fcy23i8,1578082502.0,"Except it doesn't imply that. Apply that to working, ""only 2 hours left"" doesn't mean you can just fuck off for two hours and ignore the work, it just means ""thank fuck it's only 2 more hours"". 

Apply it to this, ""thank fuck we've made some serious progress"". Being grateful that life doesn't suck as much as it did 100 years ago doesn't mean we can ignore problems, but it helps to give context and make it easier to deal with the struggles we still face when we have some context."

todayilearned,fcwtr93,t1_fcwq9xn,1578037269.0,"The way I've always seen political correctness is what is the acceptable political view. It isn't tied to the left or right politically. 

It isn't necessarily against hateful speech, that's just the modern version of it. But Hitler did practice a version of it. So did Stalin. Which, makes sense. Communism isn't just Marxism, there's so many different flavors of it that a communist revolution will have so many different players with wildly different views. So why does the discussion rely on political correctness only having one use? Should communism be debated by Leninism? Maoism? Stalinism? Should nihilism only be debated by edgy twats who believe that nothing mattering means they can act like twats? 

I'm not the other guy, but he's not really wrong. It's just that Political Correctness as a concept isn't just ""stand against hateful speech"". It's ""what is the correct political stance"", and historically, people who stepped out from that stance were persecuted, and arguably, that's a reason to be concerned. Especially when we have examples of perceived slights causing real harm. 

Free society has no business saying what is and isn't okay to believe. People shouldn't be punished for believing in something stupid or wrong or ""wrong"". They should be debated, and when it comes to racism, xenophobia, or any other hateful belief, debate it's not hard to win. Before the age old strawman of ""sO wE sHoUlD iGnOrE iT?"" comes up, no. Debate words and ideas, punish actions that are wrong. Bigots get a hard on for shit like the post or someone getting fired for saying ""niggardly"" because they can use it as an example of political correctness gone wrong. 

And as a closing thing, ideas aren't stopped by force. Nazism still exists despite a war. Communism didn't disappear in the US despite McCarthyism. Christianity is now one of the largest religions despite Rome's persecution. You cannot kill an idea with a sword. All that does is create martyrs."

Yeah, sure. Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, and a whole host of other pieces of shit espoused views like yours. Authoritarianism is a disgusting.

TooAfraidToAsk,fcmhl3s,t1_fcmegcn,1577775562.0,"Well, because I'm a responsible adult who wants to ensure my kid will have excellent medical care, no. I won't cry. I'll trust in medical professionals to treat my child, and I'll be there for them 100% so they don't have to feel alone. 

Life isn't wonderful all the time. I never said it was. I did say that life is more than negatives, and I'll say that my life has had more highs than lows despite being raised by a narcissistic bigoted bastard and an alcoholic who got clean after 14 years and pretended she was a great mother. Despite all the loneliness and hurt, my life has been fairly positive. I've had to survive on 300 dollars a month when total bills came out to 500. I got an abusive coke addict pregnant at 13 and she did the right thing and gave the kid up for adoption. I've been cheated on, I've overdosed, I've wrecked multiple relationships for self destructive reasons  I've seriously considered suicide multiple times. I had the gun to my head at one point. Yet, because of the love and support of my friends, my aunt, my sister, and my cousin, I'm still able to look back on it all and be happy. Because they helped me endure the lows and made riding the highs the best times of my life. 

Life is only miserable if you let it be. Nihilism helped a lot honestly, realizing none of it matters except what you make of it. Self determination. I could whinge and dwell on the pain. I could easily say that having a child isn't worth it because of all the pain I've felt. But I don't think so, because of all the highs. I can't even imagine what my life would've been like if my dad wasn't a piece of human garbage. If my mom hadn't developed an addiction. If I came from a loving and supportive home free of manipulative bullshit. Maybe I wouldn't have put a gun to my head. Maybe I wouldn't have coped by snorting and smoking anything I could get my hands on. But that doesn't matter, because I know I can do better. I can give my child a home where they feel loved and wanted. Where they feel safe. Where they don't have to pretend to be anything but themself. And I can make sure I don't have a child with a narcissist. I already know what to look out for on addiction and can get ahead of it if need be. And most importantly, I can wait till I'm financially secure enough and have a partner that I'm comfortable enough with to have a child. 

I'm done now, got other obligations to take care. Sorry for being so rude, I was dealing with a pretty heavy comedown and some unresolved feelings, and I regret that I took them out on you. Have a wonderful day/night."
starterpacks,fcmfx7v,t1_fcmdkey,1577773772.0,"Would you like to source him saying it? Like an interview or newspaper article? It's just that evidence is a huge part of any debate, and if Bradbury is on record saying that it wasn't about censorship, then that's what he said. You don't get to call him confused because you don't like what he had to say. 

And it's stupid from your POV, but the fact is that it's interpretation. It's not inherently stupid so long as concepts like ""death of the author"" exist. Unless there's no supporting evidence for it, that's the only time it's stupid. 

Dismissing it as stupid is what a lot of white supremacists bank on. None of their arguments hold up to actual scrutiny. So they spin their bullshit to a group who may be interested, and finish it with ""and they're gonna call you stupid for believing it. Because they don't want the truth to get out"" or some variation of it. Same for MLMs or Cults. They WANT people to separate themselves from people who don't hold those views, because the enemy of hateful ideology is debate and rhetoric. 

Your comment is easy to ""refute"". Just state death of the author, say that any interpretation is valid, and that you're suppressing freedom of thought and trying to control how people think. You must be a bleeding heart liberal who wants everyone to just pretend that reality doesn't exist and blah blah blah. See? It's really not that hard to spin if you've read half their comments. And they take comments like yours, put them into an echo chamber and then circle jerk over how evil you are. 

As well, and this one is going to get me in some form of trouble or another, most racists don't know any different. They were raised by racists, were taught by racist, and don't have any reason to believe otherwise, especially when they can easily find an echo chamber to support them. So just dismissing their point of view as stupid does nothing except give them a reason to ignore anything you say. You don't have to tolerate their ideals, because they're gross, but at least make a coherent argument as to why without insulting them."
