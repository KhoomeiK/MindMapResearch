You didn't call her out. 

You didn't shame anybody. 

You were providing a service and she was trying to make it all about her and make you feel bad for no reason. I honestly feel sorry for her if she gets all offended and upset every time someone does a service for people with disabilities. Must be a pretty sad life to always be looking for reasons to be offended. 
Forget her. Her feelings are all on her and weren't caused by you. She is just unhappy, living a sad life, and looking to project it on you."

As much as I sympathize with wanting to keep the money and not report it AGAIN, I personally would suggest reporting it to someone else or at least to the same person but with a paper trail (email at least) so it can't come back on you if shit hits the fan.

The top chains are Little Caesars, Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Papa Johns, with some others more popular in some parts in the country. At Little Caesars and Dominos, you can get a low quality large pizza with one topping for $6-7 or a better quality of the same pizza from Papa Johns or Pizza Hut for $8 or so. But if you go to one of the smaller chains, the quality varies widely and some charge $10 or more for one topping large pizzas.

AmItheAsshole,ff18gsr,t3_er44eo,1579476281.0,"NTA I see it this way. There is nothing to be gained by telling him. It can only cause more pain. Your sisters are experiencing a knee-jerk reaction to being lied to. They're hurt and they think the right thing to do is to tell your father to hurt your mother and open his eyes. But what are his eyes supposed to be opened to? Something that happened decades ago. Old pain. And you know what? So many couples stay together after infidelity- you can't know that they haven't already gone over this and decided to let it be forgiven and forgotten. Bringing it up would only reopen a wound in that case. 

You wtba if you brought it all up now. Reach out to the bio dad if you must but don't hurt the father that has been good to you in a quest for righteous justice."

AmItheAsshole,fenpv2f,t3_eq4a6o,1579289144.0,"YTA for asking for mandatory gym visits. I wouldn't bring up the weight aspect. Chances are, when she sobers up and is thinking clearly, she will see it herself. Bringing it up (weight and mandatory gym) is super risky, no matter how you approach it. Now, if you were on the subject of detoxing and she said something along the lines if not knowing how to detox, you can bring up going to the gym and offer to join her to help motivate her. 

NAH by bringing up the drinking (depending on her reaction, she might end up being TA). You aren't asking her to give it up completely, and if it seems like she isn't receptive to a dramatic change right away, you can offer to compromise by going down to 2 nights a week at first and work down over time."

relationship_advice,fem4r94,t3_epw3up,1579239724.0,"I guess it depends on what is really going on with her husband. If they re just arguing, I would recommend distancing yourself because it isn't helping her marriage to be hanging on some other guy. She needs to water her own garden, so to speak, if she intends on staying married. And I'm sure you don't want to fall into that old scenario where the person tells you they love you and want you but that they're not going to leave their SO, or giving empty promises that they're going to end things and not actually end them. 

If they are officially split and divorcing, then I would definitely have a long conversation about where things are going and how she feels and what she wants. The last thing you need is to invest time and energy and feelings in this only to find out she was only hanging on you just to make herself feel better and because she liked the attention, not because she had any genuine feelings for you."
