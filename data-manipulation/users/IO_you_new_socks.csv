LetsTalkMusic,fff2urv,t3_et9tnc,1579874206.0,My biggest issue with a lot of live rappers is the fact that they often play the full song (vocals included) while the artist yells the some of the lyrics and jumps around.
baseball,ffe87pp,t3_esvvqv,1579839359.0,"In all honesty, I can't wait to see relievers (and that includes the Yanks) have some unreal meltdowns trying to get that third guy out in the beginning of the season. 

I've always thought that the approach of ""bring a new guy in/wait he walked someone bring him out"" was lame. If you bring in a reliever, he better be good enough to close out an inning."
NYYankees,ffe75lf,t3_et11pf,1579838505.0,This is the kind of off-season shitposting that makes me want to spend an irresponsible amount of money on Yankee's jerseys.

gainit,ffar1ps,t3_eskl34,1579742485.0,"In all honesty, I would be shocked if nicotine consumption has any measurable effect on the average weightlifter's progress. There is some appetite suppression at play, but for me (anecdote ahead) I never had any issues with eating while I was a smoker. 

That being said, you're better off kicking nicotine while you're still a kid. It's a big fat money sink that's better spent on supplements and questionably legal SARMs...

audioengineering,ff1kj2a,t3_er42vc,1579480665.0,"I've always stuck with a high pass of around ~75Hz for deeper voices and I've never had an issue. Maybe use a harmonic exciter on the deeper parts of the eq spectrum to fatten up the bass range a tiny bit?

Also, you said you had a filter through the bass and low midrange? I don't know if that means a single high pass up to like 250Hz, but that'll take the balls off of any kind of low range singing. Cut up to ~75hz like I mentioned before and use a notch to carve 3-6db out of the 300hz range. This will keep the bass while getting rid of any ugly boxiness."
