These people will disappear at the hint of the first dig-sitting request or after they’ve fulfilled their promise to you EXACTLY ONCE.

If the dog is to be inside 8-5 in most days while you’re at work, don’t get a dog.  If you can/do work from home 3+ weekdays, still carefully consider it.

For any scenario you think of that requires consideration, think of yourself being in that scenario yourself, but unable to leave or make any choices for yourself, except where to sit, until your human gets home... what if they’re late? What if they’re sick or tired and not in the mood to immediately take you out for a DECENT walk (read: 1 hour+) after you’ve been inside a house all day....

If it’s cold for you where you are, it will be cold for them too. They can’t turn on the heater or get another blanket just in case you forgot to leave one out...

Just remember to treat/respect them they way you’d want to be treated/respected. If you cannot  for ANY amount of time, DON’T get a dog.

If you can for 100% of the time you have them, and no less(!), enjoy your pup!

For what you’re looking for, I’d recommend an Australian Cattle Dog. The rewards are unlimited, but for the first few years, so is the work required to raise/train them!
