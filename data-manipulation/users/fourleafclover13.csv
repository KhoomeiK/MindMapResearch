Horses,fgcw12b,t1_fgcs0fv,1580676720.0,You will have to fight hard. Any way you could hand feed? By this I mean take an hour and just let her graze while you hold lead line in pasture or year. With this you could work on grooming as well starting with soft brush then add rough?
Horses,fgcveyl,t1_fgcptsl,1580676613.0,I hope everything works out. I hate to suggest you either need a trainer wihh experience that isn't aggressive. You might have to sell to another. Sadly you cannot know how well they with train or treat here. So stress to even think about.
Horses,fgcoksn,t1_fgcgofu,1580674778.0,"When you have an abused horse you have to treat them as an abused horse. They don't immediately get of what was done. You must take the time to train as if they were. You don't just treat them the way a horse would be worked with iff they have never been trained. These are two different things so you act accordingly.

I'm not saying you baby them. Just that you must be more gentle in the beginning. I've been training over 15 almost 20 years. I worked with dangerous horse, abused, and some untrained even at 8 years. Treat each horse as the individual they are. From head shy to picking feet things are worked with different."
Horses,fgcfmal,t1_fgbq421,1580672197.0,"Why give this advice? An abused horse has learn to trust again you don't man handle them.
It isn't about tip toeing this horse needs a gentle hand a tons of ground work to learn to trust that is the best thing you can do. Making a great horses doesn't take 60 days but years. 

If a horse is abused then they have been abused you do not want to bully them. You must work to build on trust and bonding. Only thing I agree with is she needs away from sister."
Horses,fgcdv7h,t3_exifa1,1580671739.0,"You need to first start with when you feed her stand beside the bucket and give treats to her. While she eat groom her and this will start a bond. Take your time bussing her. You must be consistent and slowly build up. Take her into a round pen and use line to sently shake or tiny circles to push her forward. When she starts to move stop using lead. I wouls suggest putting lunge line whip on ground she she can walk over or explore as she wants. If you do not stop your sister then horse will stay shy. Once she is comfortable with ground work you can change directions and come to you.
For this I'll suggest pat Monty Robert's or Pat Parelli with natural horsemanship. This is training and working with them using their and your bodie language to work as a team. It is time consuming  but builds a strong bond. (if any one tells you to ignore the abuse or just treat them like a regular horse ignore that). Just like a Chile they need to learn trust again. While working wihh ground work treat this a a baby who knows nothing. Click for walk & trot  the entire time that are using that gait and mooch for lope. Work on being able to have her follow you around. Do not take weeks this can take months and that's okay. Start gently. A great horse isn't made in 60 days it takes years. Right now at her age they shouldn't even be mounted. You can teach anything you need for in the saddle on ground. When you are about to start mounting first introduce blanket and saddle before putting on. Once on gently tighten the girth and lunge with only that on. I suggest using bozzle to start this means using gentle hands. The most you should try when time for bit is snaffle or mechanical hackamore. Using either of these you need light hands. 

For the water start with just doing feet always start at the feet. Grab a bucket and use a hand towel to wipe her down work up. Work at her pace for everything. Again keep sister away as she id's adding to the problem. 

Is you have questions about detail message me. My main focus when training was dangerous and ""lost cause horses"". Only found one I couldn't help  he had been beaten with chain to point of breaking shoulder blade. We spent a year working wihh him after three other trainers before me. He was going to either kill himself or us. He would constantly flip onto his back and cracked two legs on day so we gave him a peaceful send off."

memes,ffu5q6i,t1_ffu1udz,1580235056.0,"Redirect for things like barking:
When they first start to bark acknowledge that they are barking. I use ""thank you for telling me"" then ask them to come to me. If you use clicker training then if the look at you or do come to you click then give praise and or treat. If you are consistent then they will bark once then come to you or stop barking altogether. 
You should also have worked on socializing including meeting neighbors the they don't go ballistic every time they leave or come back home. 
They also need mental and physical stimulus this will keep them happy and tired. A tired do is less likely to get excited by every noise, again socializing let's them learn about world around them. No mTter what sine breeds are more vocal than others. 

Force free means you don't use harsh tools like pinch, shock collars or yanking on leash to make them do something. Using things like clickers to mark exactly what you want them to do. This helps them learn what is expected of them. You do not use punishment to learn. You teach them what is expected of them. You redirect what you do not want by giving a good thing to do. 

Consistent with everything same thing same time everytime. 
Constant- everything you do is constantly a chance to work with them. Even just sitting around house they lay down say ""good down"" same with sit and all wanted commands. 
Complete-- make sure you understand completely how to do what you are asking. You also meed to be sure they have a complete understanding of what is being asked.

Look at Michael Vick was guilty of financing, participating and killing dogs. Owning fighting dogs. Yet he was forgiven almost immediately by everyone claiming he was still a good person. 
I could list abusers and other shitty things they get away with.

For those that need quick reminder:
He pleaded guilty to ""Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture"". Vick admitted to providing most of the financing for the operation, and to participating directly in several dog fights in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina. He admitted to sharing in the proceeds from these dog fights. He further admitted that he knew his colleagues killed several dogs who did not perform well. He admitted to being involved in the destruction of 6–8 dogs, by hanging or drowning.

Vick's first endorsement after being released from prison was a two-year deal on January 27, 2011 with Unequal Technologies, a company that produces football pads.[176] Nike officially signed Vick again as an athlete on July 1, 2011. The company had been supplying him with complimentary gear since October 2009; his re-signing marked the first time a sponsor had brought back an athlete after dropping him.[177]

In 2012, Vick launched a sports clothing line called V7 to be sold exclusively at Modell's.

Why was he not banned from the sport and still allowed to get endorsements? I'd be ashamed of my company giving this filth anything."

insaneparents,fftex0a,t1_fftaco5,1580218567.0,"Sadly this means parents sometimes both work full time incldung picking up extra shifts or working overtime. Some have a part time as well then aren't home to teach basic life skils, manners, responsibility. They don't have time or mental energy to handle discipline or aren't home enough too.
This is screwing up the childrens possibility to go to college or be prepared for the real world. When a parent isn't home or if they are they sleep it feels so isolated. You have nothing to aspire from as you constantly get told cannot afford college so get used to retail work. It's worse when from small town and you live miles from town family cannot afford even a cheap vehicle. Meaning your stuck in your mind making you give up on life and even school. When you told all your life you'll never be able to get out of your home town. You cannot get job to help self or even imagine how you'll be anything more.

Parents protect you from the world around you
Yet they fail to protect you from themselves.

Sorry long winded but coming from a single home where parent worked 80 hours a week. If home was asleep or being abusive. My grandmother taught me to take care of house, cloths and self. The reason I ended up being a OCD, diagnosis from doctor, cleaner is due to how trashy house got if I didn't do all the work. For a reference she would leave trash, food every where only clean litter box once a week. I do it 3 to 4 times daily or immediately after use if I'm there to see cat using."

The second they start to go excitedly praise and love for going outside if using clicker click it to mark the wanted behavior. After still play a little as this helps with bonding. 
You must be consistent same thing everytime.

Once back inside do some training, puzzles or just some play time with pup. For training, of you don't know, this can be very simple it's called name it and claim it. 
If dog lays down, sit, comes to you any behavior you want. The second they do a behavior  click and say ""good _____"" gving treat or exercise. This way your teaching the with things they naturally are doing. Using lonly force free training you'll have a great bond and friend.
