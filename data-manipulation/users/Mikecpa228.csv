stopsmoking,ffee3nd,t3_et0n3r,1579844612.0,"Now turn 1 month into 2! Then 2 months becomes 6 months etc. This is how you build a solid quit one day at at time. By the way, you just passed the most difficult month which is the first. When you get a strong craving ask yourself, ""do I really want to go thru all that hell again?"" Congrats and keep up your momentum!"
Boxers,ffdt0ap,t3_esuieb,1579828180.0,Looks like my Molly. They have the same exact mask! Great pic.
stopsmoking,ffdstpe,t1_ffcox8a,1579828046.0,great suggestion about making a list! I did this early on in my quit and it helped me a lot.
stopsmoking,ffdsrl9,t3_eswgrc,1579828003.0,"Great start! turn 10 days into 10 weeks one day at a time. You should be getting over the worst physical withdrawals so it will start to get easier shortly. Great suggestion to make a list of why you want to stay quit and post it on your refrigerator or paste it onto a 3x5"" index card and keep it with you. I am very visual so I found terrifying pictures of diseases caused by smoking and saved them to my phone. Whatever works for you do it!"
stopsmoking,ffbh22j,t1_ffbfaen,1579764958.0,"I realize those odd thoughts are just thoughts. Having a thought is ok but giving in to it is not! Just come to the realization that no matter what happens you won't smoke! Nothing that life throws at you justifies smoking. I'm going thru some emotional turmoil at the moment but I know smoking won't help me at all. Furthermore, I know if I smoked I would be absolutely devastated and things would be unbearable. Cherish your quit and never give it up. There are easy and difficult times when you quit. Some months fly by and others seem to take forever. Keep up the great work! I'm here if you ever need support just DM me."
stopsmoking,ffbdbni,t3_eslx35,1579760522.0,"That's exactly how you do it mate! I also had a day from hell today but guess what, I did NOT smoke! Just realize that if you did smoke would it really help truthfully? I think not. Like my 21 year old niece tells me, ""some days are good and some days are bad, that's just how it goes!"" As bad as my day was today my saving grace is that I did not smoke! So all in all it was not a god awful day. Do some what if exercises, like If I'm having a shit day at work I will do blank. For me, it helps to go for a long walk. Be prepared ahead of time so you set yourself up for success. I have 4 years quit but still have really shitty days where I may ""think"" about smoking but I will NOT give in to that thought. That's all it is a thought. Train yourself to not listen to your bad thoughts. Also, like several others have said your emotions will level out and you won't feel so stressed or angry I promise. What truly matters about last night is that you did NOT give in that's all! That's how you build a strong quit one bad craving at a time. Congrats Mate! Stick it out I promise it'll get easier and better."

stopsmoking,ff8dden,t3_es086h,1579673822.0,"“Yes I may be smoking but at least I’m not drinking” is irrational. Smoking can kill you faster and easier than drinking. I understand your using it as a crutch to not drink but at this point you should be ready to quit it. I also think your overthinking it. You quit alcohol, drugs, gambling and love but you “can’t” quit smoking?? You can do this just exactly the same way u quit other addictions."
