interestingasfuck,ffhsli6,t1_ffhhwb8,1579951765.0,"Thermodynamically that doesn't sound right.

 If your slab loses x amount of thermal energy every minute, in 60 minutes with the heating off you'd have lost 60x to the air, decreasing the temperature.

The heater will have to use 60x of energy to bring the slab back to the same temperature if it was off. But it also would have to spend 60x of energy in the same hour if it was left on to counteract the heat loss anyway.

I'm probably forgetting something important though, like condensation, but i don't know how important it is in this scenario."

The availability of the nutrients in the soil like phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium etc., and soil toxicity like the concentration of aluminum is [regulated largely by soil pH](https://imgur.com/a/GVmMfFQ), which should be around 6 for most crops.
