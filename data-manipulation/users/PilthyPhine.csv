And that’s one of the things that kills me. My family was always poor (I was homeless when I was six) and my grandmother lives in the projects of New York City. She can’t get treatment and she can’t travel. The quality of her last three years are gonna be the same quality as the past twenty years. It pains me more than anything in the world to know she’s gonna die poor and unfulfilled. I don’t want that for her, i don’t want that for anyone — but what am I gonna do about it?

The irony is that she’ll be dishing out treatment to patients while not being able to even afford to be a patient herself.
