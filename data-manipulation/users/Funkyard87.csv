>Turkish identity was  created by Young Turks members who, like Greek nationalists, were  influenced by the popular nationalism trend in Europe, which led to many  wars and break up of Ottoman Empire, led to creation of ""nation  states"".

&#x200B;

As i said, Turkish descendants were the status quo. They didn't try to break up from the Ottoman Empire. They tried to keep what the others had left intact. The other populations liberated themselves (except Kurds who you are calling terrorists now). There is a difference.

&#x200B;

>Before that Greeks weren't Greeks either. They were ""Rum (Roman) Orthadox"".

&#x200B;

You are half right, the vast majority of the population of the Byzantine empire were in fact Greeks. That's why the culture was Greek and not Latin. Unfortunately, Slavs and Bulgars in the empire were mostly slaves from Balkan wars. Half of the Assyrian territory were Greeks, north Egypt too. The Romans you mean were a small aristocrat minority in East Roman empire. Also, southern Italians and Greeks are of common origin. Roman was a common term.

&#x200B;

>Also many of us has family roots from somewhere else. My father's family  was deported to Turkey from Thessaloniki after Balkan wars, it was  their country for generations, and before that they were deported from  Spain and other parts of Europe. My mother's family fled to Istanbul  from Circassia fleeing the Russian Circassian genocide in the 19th  century. And what's a ""your pro-Turk types""? You know, today city of  Trabzon has some of the most fanatically nationalist people in Turkey  and they are the descendents of Pontus Rums (Greeks) of Trebizond who  converted to Islam through out centuries and mixed with other Muslims of  the empire. We all have roots from somewhere else in the Empire and you  are in no position to ""talk down at people"". You're not the descendents  of ancient Greeks and ""Asia Minor"" belonged to someone else before them  and others before and then before all of us homo sapiens came out of  Ethiopia. Read some of Yuval Harari's books, Sapiens is a good read..

&#x200B;

You mention the Circassian genocide as a despicable thing, which it is, while you support again and again the same mediaval shitty aggressive and imperialist ideologies from your people and governments in the bloody 21st century. Still. Intimidating Armenians, Kurds, Syrians, Greek Cypriots, Greeks, Bulgarians. And whoever has a different opinion is in jail or a ""terrorist"". No other civilised population thinks like that.

Again, fanatics are the problem wherever they come from, I don't give a bit for their ancestry or nationality. They all should cease to exist whatever they are. Through education or not. They support genocides and hatred and feed dictatorships and capitalism. The fanatics of Pontus you mentioned are no different. They were raised to be that way. That was turkification. And this is the root of your despicable ideologies and problems. Unfortunately, this problem can't be solved in a generation. And education won't change while Erdogan and the likes are on stage.

I talk down only at this kind of people.

DNA tests are accurate. The ancient Greek and modern Greek genes are the same. They are specific.

Again, you are speaking of ancient history while you are trying to justify barbaric acts of today.

&#x200B;

>But like Israel occupying and now annexing Golan Heights for her  security, Turkey also does it for her security and security of Cypriots.  I wish Turkey and Greece could talk in a problem solving manner but  neither country wants to. And most treaties become treaties after  winning barbaric wars. Or losing. Otherwise those Islands would've been  Italian today.

&#x200B;

Putting aside Golan Heights, Israel is also wrong in many issues, especially Gaza. If they respected Palestinians no one would dislike them.

So, Turkey is doing this for the sake of Cypriots?

And what's the actual problem? Greece only responds to the aggressiveness of Turkey. Did Greece threaten Turkey with invasion? No. Greece has no dispute with Turkey. It just wants to be left alone. It wouldn't even concern itself otherwise. Turkey, on the other hand, invades Greek National Airspace and EEZ every single day, abuse Greek fishing vessels in Greek territories, threatens Greece to share its resources just because, overflows Greek islands with immigrants to change the demographic and produce instability and dispute. And Greece is at fault. Wth? Where is the logic in all that? If I intimidated you to give me your belongings just because, would you accept? Why should Greece?

Your statement above indicates that you are craving for war; ""I wish for their well-being but as long as Turkey wants Greece's property war must be done"". It is ill-minded.

&#x200B;

>And no, I don't support Erdogan's foreign policy or any policies or vote  for him. Unfortunately he wins a race against 4 candidates who are even  worse than him, if you can imagine. Turkey needs to replace him asap.  If Turkey treated her NATO allies better and approached this issue with a  friendly, problem solving leader, I'm sure Turkey would also be invited  to Israel-Cyprus deal. Turkey and Israel used to be strong allies  before Erdogan.

&#x200B;

Urban cities are trying. But most of the people who can change Turkey are either afraid or in jail or exiled. Every different approach is labelled as terrorism. People like Imamoglu can make a difference but he would need time to change dramatically the deep state.

Of course they would invite Turkey. Greece would also share EEZ south of Kastelorizo as it should. But not with a knife to their throat and warcries and without giving a fair share. The same goes for Syria and Kurds. Respect and friendship is earned. Plus, if the countries of the region respected and collaborated with each other no one would have the leverage to exploit them.

>Yes, but islands becoming DMZ was  also ratified by treaties signed by Greece and Allied Powers and it's  status is kept to this day. Just like how you claim Turkey violating  international treaties by violating UNCLOS (which Turkey isn't a  signatory of and nonparticipant, like United States and Israel also  aren't among a few other nations), you have to be fair and openmindedly  consider when the other side rightfully makes a claim about Greece also  violating international treaties, including the treaty which is the  reason the lslands now belong to Greece instead of Italy, which  stipulates certain conditions, one of which mandates the Islands to be  DMZ, regardless of how threatened Greece might feel of a possible  Turkish invasion.  
>  
>Just like how  you expect Turks to fairly consider your claim, you should show the same fair approach and admit when your country also violates a treaty for  which you are a signatory of. Your country put signature on a contract  and violates the conditions of it, which would even give a legal argument to challenge Greek ownership of the islands for violating terms  and conditions of your contract.

As mangas1821 stated above:

&#x200B;

>Turkey  already broke the treaty in 1936 when it revoked the autonomy and  demilitarised status of Imbros and Tenedos and started a state sponsored  discrimination campaign against Greeks on both the islands and in Istanbul.  
>  
>Which as I'm sure you  know ended with the Istanbul pogrom of 1951, after which Greeks decided  they've had enough and left the city.

&#x200B;

In fact, it didn't end. In 1964 the Turkish government engaged in pogroms and confiscated the properties of the Greek natives of Imvros and Tenedos after subjecting the populations of the islands to the atrocities by common criminals who were brought to the island under false pretenses. This caused the expatriation of the natives. Almost 20000 Greeks used to live there, now a couple of hundred. The exact same thing Erdogan is trying to do in North Syria now. Ethnic cleansing.

Your ""legal"" arguments and pretenses are by no means hypocritical and only serve your support of imperialism. And you keep blaming Greece for defending itself. kudos.

&#x200B;

>Cyprus the same thing. Both sides violate laws. Greece for supporting a  bloody coup which resulted in murder of Turkish Cypriots (which, by the  way, is conveniently left out of all arguments when making genocide  arguments for Turkey, because apparently killing Turks is fair game but  all others is a crime simply because of your low IQ view of Turks,  which, in your eye, all Turks are dumb peasants, half human half animal  barbarians and must be kept in zoos).

&#x200B;

Which fucking lunatic supports killing of any kind? You realise that Greece back then was governed by a **god-damned fascist dictatorship** and tried to do the same in Cyprus? They didn't only kill Turkish Cypriots but democratic Greek Cypriots as well. They were unquestionably trash. Of course Turkey had every right to interfere but its following counterpart actions were no different than the Greek fascists' (including occupation, establishment of many mainland Turks, interference in Turkish Cypriots policies). The Greek dictatorship ended in the same year. Turkey still occupies half the country 45 years later and is trying to seize the EEZ of the rest illegally.

No, Turks in general are fine. I have many friends Turks, I even had two girlfriends, and thank god they are nothing like this. Most of them fled Turkey because they were (or would be) considered terrorists in your country because of their beliefs. The problem is the **rascist/ultranationalist** kind, which worships  submission, unequality, and malevolence. You keep doing so for more than a 100 years and is the source of all internal problems and disparities in your country. You have driven your new established country through genocides and ethnic cleansing. Barbarians is not far from the truth, all fascist are cancerous. The thing is in most civilised countries they are a small minority and not welcomed. In your country is still a vast majority, driven by propaganda, fundamental religion, xenophobia, poverty and lack of education in eastern and rural regions. Nationality or Blood has nothing to do with these.

&#x200B;

>But I got news for you. You aren't genetically different than Turks.  Muslims of Ottoman Empire, which included a lot of Greek converts to  Islam intermarried for centuries. For half a millenia, Greek people  lived under Ottoman rule. Not Turkish. Ottoman.

&#x200B;

Of course, Ottomans aren't Turkish. Do you even know what led to the fall of Constantinople and generally the Byzantine empire? A class conflict, not a conqueror. Ottomans (Kayi tribe) were mercenaries of the empire before that. Most of the common people were sick of disparities, wanted a change and sided with them. Most of Mehmed's armies were all sorts of Christians, his generals were Christian Greeks, Mehmed himself was half Greek, Christianity sympathiser and defender of freedom of religion. After his death things changed. Most of the Greeks and other ethnicities didn't convert to Islam willingly; children were taken and educated for that purpose and women were forced to marry or entertain Tribesmen and birth children for the longevity of the tribe. Status quo were Turkish descendants.  Of course, after some generations other populations declined even though Turkish descendants weren't really Turkish anymore. A small tribe can't assimilate millions. Most of the modern Turks are at least 50% related to Greeks, the others around 30%. The only true difference is religion and the persective that comes from state education. You even call all muslims Turks. Even if they call themselves Bulgarians or Greeks.

Nevertheless, it's the only way. Billionaires, who made a fortune exploiting the global warming concernings, have only claimed the lead from the ones who are still dependent on fossil fuel. But they themselves still use fossil fuel for various reasons. Also, many materials (rare earth elements, etc) that are used in renewable resources also affect negatively the environment (many times over in some cases~SF6). Plus, the mining damages local areas. Moreover, the recycling still lacks efficiency and structure. Nowadays, the new resources lead to a new wave of political turmoils (Chile, Bolivia~lithium). For all the above, these billionaires act like their predecessors and they don't even try to pretend. Detail is too important this time for all of us and it's not even part of the picture for them yet. Better than nothing but the world can't wait decades for an actual improvement.
