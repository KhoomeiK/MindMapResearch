In reality most people will buy and sell within the time they hold the mortgage as well. With the parental loan, make you never say to the bank it's a loan or they factor it in against how much they'll lend you.

Hello fresh: you get to choose the meals which is good. Much higher in calories. Generally quicker to cook. 

WOOP: the fastest to prepare and the most expensive because most is done for you. They have a few different options for types of bags 

Foodbox: more like a grocery delivery service than a meal prep kit, they don’t come with everything for a whole meal. 

I have referral codes for all of them, not sure if sharing that on here is okay. I’ve documented my reviews on my blog if you want to see pics and more details. Basically I reckon order a week of each and see what you like best, that’s what I did.

Term deposits: you’ll always get back what you put in, plus interest. I put in $10k into a 1 year term deposit and I’ve earned about $250 interest over that time. So it’s not a huge amount but it’s better than a normal bank account and the benefit is that you can’t easily access it. Generally the longer your money is locked up, the higher your interest rate is. Investment funds: it is possible for you to lose money in them, but you will also have the possibility for higher returns. It’s better for long term growth, but you have to be prepared to see dips in the market at times. 

I believe you can open a term deposit with any bank but I’ve only ever done it with my bank that I’m already with so I can’t guarantee it. From my research when I set up my term deposit there isn’t a major difference in interest rates."

What are you intending to use it for - are you aiming to withdraw for a house or leave it for retirement? It seems like you have good self control with savings so I’d drop it down to whatever your employer matches, usually 3%, and put the other 5% in another investment fund. Most banks and KiwiSaver providers also have funds that are run similar to KiwiSaver but you can withdraw whenever you want. It’s often useful to have more accessible money than having it tied up in KiwiSaver. If you aren’t planning to use it in the next day 3-5 years, I’d change it to a growth fund. The risks are higher but the rewards are too. I wish I had been in a growth fund from the beginning. 

For where to put your savings, there’s a few options which depend on your appetite for risk and lifestyle. Savings accounts, most banks offer a few kinds. ASB for example has some with fairly low interest but then another account type where you get much higher rates if you have limited withdrawals. There’s term deposits. Then there’s investment funds. I would have approx 3 months emergency fund saved in the bank, then the rest in a term deposit for a while, whilst you research your options maybe."
