hockey,ffcflog,t1_ffc8xtu,1579798407.0,"The beginning of the salary cap era was him still banking off of the 2000's teams he built with no cap. You won't see an immediate change the day the salary cap was implemented but you sure can see it now. 

Ownership ""forced"" him to win the playoffs even before the cap so that's no an excuse. He wasn't forced off the team, he was waiting until his contract expired so Yzerman could step in. They let him leave on his own accord.
 
That being said, yea 08 and 09 were great but what about once Lidstorm, datsyuk and the other highly skilled players of the pre-cap era left the team, how did Holland do? He was banking off of players already drafted, not the ones he was drafting in post-cap decision. When it came time to rely on the younger players, he either let them sit in the AHL or brought forth the wrong guys for the job and gave them to Blashill who is part of a different discussion.

I'm not saying we can win forever, but this season and last season are record-breaking losing seasons and the majority of the reason is Holland's past contracts and draft capital. The dude did a great job for most of his career but it was time for him to go."

He filled this team with overbearing contracts that we're still paying for (Green, Zetterberg, Franzen, Datsyuk as of recent, Kronwall, etc.). They were great players but bad contract deals that ended up choking this team's future picks and expansion.

Also he always refused to bring up young guys and give them a proper chance to show themselves and they were either traded or kept in the AHL to be stars there.

He was an old-school guy working with a new age system. He was a fantastic GM until the cap system was implemented.

MechanicalEngineering,ff98kuu,t3_escim4,1579707342.0,"Mechanical Engineering comprises of much more than math. Depending on the position you take of course, engineering consists of a lot of validation, processes, group work, testing and audits. Physics and math greatly influence how you handle problems and projects in engineering but you will not sit down and do it everyday. College courses teach you how to think and problem solve but that doesn't mean you'll be doing Laplace Transforms and deriving Dynamics equations everyday forever.

My advice: Never take a job just because the pay is good. Your life will have no meaning and the work will be pointless. Take a job that makes you feel good and that you can wake up everyday and tolerate (No, most people don't love their jobs 24/7).

I took Mechanical Engineering because I love helping people, working in groups, creating things and figuring out how things work.

You could always get an associates in Math, take a few engineering design courses and if you don't like it, become a Mathematician, Professor, Astronomer, or enter in higher study fields such as Theoretical Physics for example.

Best of luck on your journey!"

It also helps to find the positive it that thing you can't control. Using death again, i find that death is what makes life beautiful because our limited time here makes us appreciate events and people a lot more. This helps me accept death as a good thing and relieves my anexity about it.

There's even been an instance in which a yellow saber was made from unstable red saber crystal, when Jedi Jaden Korr purified it and the crystal turned yellow, granting him his third lightsaber.""

""Just like the blue and green lightsabers, the yellow lightsaber is associated with an important school of thought within the Jedi Order: that of the Sentinels (via Ubersabers). **Star Wars lore** explains that the Sentinels seek a balance between the Consulars and the Guardians, and also wish to educate themselves on other more practical aspects of life such as tracking techniques and espionage. Unlike some others in the Jedi Order, Sentinels recognize that the Force isn't actually the solution to everything.""

Another reason these thoughts occur, for me at least, is I grew up in a shattered household where I taught myself to take control of myself because of neglect and other issues. This helped me plan the future and look out for myself. One thing that's brought me is when I try to control, let's say the death of loved one, and I can't control it, I freak out and have panic attacks.
