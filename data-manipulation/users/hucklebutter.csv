I agree with you.  Namely, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.  I'm not happy about it, but Biden has the best polling numbers in those states.  

The democratic nominee is going to win in the states bordering the pacific no matter who the nominee is.  The deep south is going to vote for Trump, so Biden's lead there in the primaries isn't significant.  But his lead in the rust belt and sunbelt matters.

But New York is not nearly as important as it thinks it is.  It remains relevant in terms of investment banking as the seat of the stock exchange, and (in diminishing way) in advertising, book publishing, and journalism.  

But the four most valuable companies in the World are all on the west coast: Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.
https://www.thestreet.com/investing/alphabet-trillion-dollar-market-cap

California (i.e. Hollywood) is also the top producer of content people consume, and far more influential on American attitudes and beliefs.  The west coast is the heart of the software industry.  Gaming companies are clustered on the west coast and Asia.  

The growth of venture capital on the west coast has also diminished New York's prominence.  

None of the world’s most valuable brands (as of 2019) were located anywhere near New York.

Amazon $315.5 billion - Seattle

Apple $309.5 billion - Bay Area

Google $309 billion - Bay Area

Microsoft $251.2 billion - Seattle

Visa $177.9 billion - Bay Area

Facebook $159 billion - Bay Area

Alibaba $131.2 billion - China

Tencent $130.9 billion - China 

McDonald’s $130.4 billion - Chicago

AT&T $108.4 billion - Dallas

New York's bungling of the Amazon deal isn't going to have **any** long term effect on Amazon.  It can readily attract all the talent it needs to the Arlington / Greater Washington DC area.  But it would have been a huge boon to Queens.  No similar tech company is going to set up headquarters anywhere near there.

And Amazon isn't going away.  Aside from its huge head start in online commerce, AWS is way out in front on cloud computing.  Amazon may fade or fail at some point in the distant future, but not for many decades.

In India, independent shopkeepers / brick and mortar stores are a huge and important constituency for the BJP, as the original article in this post notes.  They understandably are terrified of Amazon's growing prominence, in the same way that horse cart manufacturers weren't happy about Henry Ford growing the market for automobiles."

I always had shitty service at Biwa, too, so Noraneko makes sense.  I quite like Afuri's ramen, so feel sad about this.  Since it opened, I see no reason to go back to Noraneko.  

Off topic: It's weird to me that many popular, very busy places can have consistently great service.  I've had great service at Toro Bravo, the Tasty empire, and Shalom Y'all.  Same at Pok Pok, and Bollywood Theater.  Rum Club, always great.

And I've had great experiences at a lot of places that are rumored to be notoriously rude.  Like Tanuki, RIP; always had a good time.  I've heard people say Lardo has bad service, but it's always been fine for me, same with Grassa.

I don't go to Robo Taco much anymore, but I always liked every person who worked there except for this one woman who worked there for a year or so who just seemed utterly miserable in every interaction she had and was a horrible person.
