I tutored for bio 101 occasionally at the request of my professor so I always tried to make good analogies since I find them very helpful myself. I studied biomedical engineering, so I wish you the best of luck! I honestly would have rather learned about combustion and steam instead of protein binding affinities in thermodynamics!"

The analogy you give doesn’t really translate unless you’re talking specifically about a pharmaceutical product, which does go through a lot of testing and trials before it’s released. 

You seem to want modern medicine to be something that is concrete when it’s anything but. It’s not some end result or a final product. More often than not, the most difficult part of medicine is finding the cause of the problem, not the solution to it. When it comes to uncommon diseases or infections it’s like trying to find a needle in a hay stack, blindfolded, while the barn is burning down around you. 

Medicine is inherently heuristic because of the immense diversity of biological systems. Modern medicine does its best to try and identify problems based on symptoms, which can lead to a misdiagnosis, because there’s so many factors that can cause certain symptoms under different conditions. These misdiagnosed cases are not anywhere near as prevalent as correct ones though. That’s why they do it this way. Symptoms suggest A, so prescribe recommended treatment for A. 

This allows for a quick turn around time for the patient as well as free up time for more patients to be seen. If it doesn’t work, they come back and then look at the case again and see that B and C can also produce these symptoms, but they are less common, so they do tests. With more rare illnesses this keeps going until specialists are involved, and even then, finding the right specialists who are experts on the chemical processes behind the specific cause may be needed just because of how complex this shit is. 

It seems like your saying that doctors, surgeons, specialists shouldn’t even say anything unless they know 100% what the problem is and have a 100% guaranteed cure. It’s completely improbable to suggest that it works this way. It simply can’t."

todayilearned,fg528li,t1_fg4byrh,1580516491.0,"To follow this analogy and keep it simple, a T cell would be more like a game warden while a B cell would be more like a wildlife biologist working for the department of natural resources. The B cell sort of “studies” the bad animals and, for lack of a better term, “teaches” the T cells how to identify and kill them."
worldnews,fg4n2ta,t1_fg3xgnl,1580506727.0,"Anyone who payed attention in high school biology would know all of this is bullshit. The issue is that people didn’t pay attention, or care to put in the effort to understand it. 

That’s the biggest problem with medical science. People just don’t know how the body works. You don’t really even have to have a deep understanding to question some of these pseudoscience claims. 

Here’s an analogy: I managed an oil change shop that did additional small services like other fluid exchanges and air filter replacements. Each vehicle is scanned in and the manufacturer’s specs would come up for us as to what oil they call for. New Honda or Toyota? 0w-20 is what it needs and is always a synthetic based oil. The number of people who told me I didn’t know what I was talking about, and that they just wanted the cheapest 5w-30 conventional, was staggering. Months later when they would return (3000 miles over the interval we recommended) we would have to document and explain that they have developed an oil leak at a gasket. They would be furious and blame us for it but we never touched said gasket. I had to explain that their choices lead to the gasket wearing prematurely. 

It boiled down to their ignorance being the cause of this issue. They don’t know how it works and heard from their uncle that they’ve “always run conventional oil just fine” in their 1987 dodge pickup so they trust him more than me, the professional, all because I’m “trying to make a buck”. In reality I made more money selling the cheap shit because it has a shorter interval between changes which ended up costing more over the course of a year because you had to have it changed 2-3 times more often. 

Same thing with medicine. People don’t know how their body works in the slightest and will believe that “it’s stores the electrons like a capacitor, and releases them into your body for energy”, when anyone who payed attention in high school biology or chemistry knows that electrons don’t just get stripped from “hundreds of natural, beneficial compounds” and they certainly don’t get “charged”. They already have a charge. Pretty sure it’s negative."
worldnews,fg4hcsk,t1_fg4bk1g,1580503330.0,"It has just as much rigor, if not more than most fields. There is an absolute fuck ton about physics and chemistry that we know absolutely nothing about. 

It’s much easier to understand something in a controlled environment. The human body is the polar opposite of that. It is easily one of the most complex and diverse systems to ever be studied. That’s why there are so many different fields of study under its umbrella. 

There is absolutely guesswork in other fields as well. It’s called research but it’s simply testing your guess about something unknown to see if it holds up or not. This is much easier when you have the luxury of testing something that you have the ability to control in some way. You do not get that luxury with the human body. In chemistry, physics, and mathematics (which is more or less the basis of almost all stem fields) you have the ability to isolate and/or control many factors in a study. That’s not the case dealing with a living person. 

You mentioned you have a rare genetic disorder. I’m assuming you have gone to see a “doctor” and they scratched their head and made some type of recommendation or ran tests but couldn’t find a solution to your issue? I’ll also assume they referred you to a “specialist” who more or less did the same?"

Only carried a 2.0 and so they kicked me out again. Also suspended me for like 2 years before I could even petition for re-entry. Definitely don’t want to make that mistake.

AskReddit,fez20gy,t1_fewno5p,1579453122.0,"I’m not sure why you’re being downvoted when you clearly know nothing about it and are trying to gain insight. I can easily understand how the social portrayal of adderall makes you question it being given to children. 

This conversation is pretty relevant to me because I’ve been up for over 27 hours on Adderall as of right now. 

That being said, I’ve been prescribed a 30mg IR Adderall tablet daily for 10 years now. I was diagnosed right after I failed out of my freshman year of college. I was always a “smart kid”, graduated high school with a 4.1 gpa and an International Baccalaureate Diploma. Got 2 scholarships to go study Biomedical Engineering. When it came time for me to have to really apply myself, find a solid work ethic and concentrate, I couldn’t do it at that high of a level. I was failing freshman calculus because I kept getting lost in middle of problems. I forgot where I was supposed to be going getting caught up in overthinking some rules and functions and completely forgetting others. My brother was tested 2 years earlier and suggested I at least get tested. 

To me, my thought processes had always been “erratic” at best, but that’s all I had ever known. Pretty much how everyone else here has described it. It’s like being at a party and trying to hear someone calling you’re name across a room packed with drunk people, and the DJ clearly has hearing loss. There’s just so much “noise” it’s impossible to hear your name clearly. 

Adderall, at least for me, pretty much kills the noise. The extent to which it does depends on the person. It takes some feeling out initially but after a few days you have a pretty good grasp on what it’s doing and talking with your doctor about how it’s affecting you will allow you to find a dosage that works for you. 

I have seen the gambit as far as dosages from several different AD(H)D medications aside from Adderall such as Vyvanse, Concerta, and Ritalin. Ive seen people who take one 5mg IR tablet whenever they feel they need to or a 10mg XR to just last through the school/work day. On the other end I’ve seen people who were prescribed a 60mg XR Vyvanse daily and one chick I know does 3 rounds of 30mg IR tablets daily (I honestly have no idea how that bitch could get prescribed 90mg of IR a day much less actually take all of it, but she is actually legit psychotic so who knows).

I have taken all 4 of these meds before, but everything except for Adderall was done more or less recreationally, mostly to study but I wasn’t diagnosed at that point. It was a case of if I had the money and could find it I would get what I could to help study and some to go party with. But not having a daily supply wasn’t very beneficial because I would either have enough to study but not for during the test or vice versa. Ritalin was my least favorite, I felt like all it did was really mellow me out. My thought process wasn’t as cloudy but there really wasn’t any stimulation. I see that as more of a high strung form of ADHD specific drug. Concerta was kinda similar for me but with a little more stimulation. I didn’t have to try as hard to get motivated. Then there’s Vyvanse which to me is more like Adderall in that it gives me a high level of stimulation and energy but feels like it comes on strong and then just tapers off after you peak. I did take one of that kids Vyvanse 60mg XR one time and I was up for 48 hours straight. Man that was a ride. Day 1 felt great but day 2 I could tell it tapered off hard. And the crash was really hard, but that’s because I didn’t play by the rules. 

When doing any drug there are “rules”, kinda like the do’s and don’ts of being on it. On AD(H)D meds the rules are fairly simple if you don’t want adverse reactions. 

First, Hydration is key. These stimulants make you run hot producing energy and you can sweat sitting still sometimes. Water is required for so many bodily processes and you will have a hard crash (feeling lethargic, irritable, very bad headache) if you don’t stay hydrated. 

Second, you gotta eat. It is a known fact these stimulants suppress your appetite, but to which degree really depends on the person. I’ve known people who really don’t notice it too much besides maybe having a lighter breakfast or lunch, and those like myself who have no desire to eat anything on a full dosage. I’ve trained myself to eat regardless, however over the years my appetite has actually come back. When you’re not replacing the energy your burning, you will have a harder crash. 

Third, don’t “over” dose yourself. By this I obviously don’t mean a typical overdose, because by the time you were even half way to that point I would imagine you wouldn’t be having a good time. What I mean is, don’t frequently take more than your daily dose and never take more than double your daily dosage. It should be noted that this is taking into account that you have found a dosage that you like. This is a rule I follow that plenty of people don’t, but I know a little something about drug delivery systems and interactions and at that point your just pissing in the wind. At a double dosage you’re going to be spinning the tires, as they say. You’ll be a little over stimulated and it won’t be really beneficial. Alongside the fact that you aren’t going to sleep for the next 12-24 hours depending on the dosage and how it affects you. This is typically when people see bad crashes. The more you take, the hotter you burn and you’ll go supernova for a bit, but the aftermath is going back the other way just as far, just as hard. This results in a bad crash mostly because of how stimulated you become, but also the fact that the appetite suppression is doubled so you more than likely won’t eat enough and you’ll be losing water at a higher rate too, via sweat and increased urination. This makes for a bad time. 

Aside from the resulting crash from taking more than your daily dose, you will destroy your tolerance and run yourself out of pills early, leaving you with possibly several days without any. You don’t really want to fuck with your neurotransmitters like that. It’ll leave you in a short form of withdrawal, and while it’s not like cold sweats and body pains, you’ll be lethargic and fuzzy headed. At least this is my personal experience as well as what I’ve seen from plenty of friends and family. Tolerance is the most important thing to keep in check to ensure the efficacy of the drug. I personally will take half doses or none at all on days I’m not doing much. If I can go few days without it, I will, without any noticeable form of withdrawal or other side affects. I just feel like I’m “not on my Adderall”. A big part of where people go wrong is that they will daily dose for a while and then start picking it up. And run out a few days early and then they get the new script and the process starts escalating to the point where they are taking 150% daily the first day they get their script back and running out half way through the month, then trying to buy some from others to try to maintain their demand. It’s all downhill from their. Basically like any drug with the potential for abuse, however it’s really no where near as bad as others I’ve seen. Opium derivatives and alcohol being the worst. 

The appetite thing has been the most adverse side affect I’ve encountered, however I had poor eating habits and a low appetite when I first started taking it to begin with so I can’t really blame the meds entirely but they didn’t help it. But like I said, I’m on one end and the majority of the people I know are more centered with a few having little impact to their appetites. 

All of this is based off of my first hand experiences from my own personal account as well as knowing a lot of people on AD(H)D meds. What’s true for me is not necessarily true for you or others. You just gotta learn how it affects you and be responsible. 

WOW I’ve said a ton already and feel like I haven’t even scratched the surface. I didn’t even talk about how it affects me, how it positively impacted my life, or even my thoughts on the kids! But anyways, If you wanna ask questions please feel free! I’ve had a lot of experience with it, some bad, but the vast majority of it has been a blessing and I love informing others on the various aspects of it!"
