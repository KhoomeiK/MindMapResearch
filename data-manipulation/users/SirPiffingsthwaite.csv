Cockatoos loved to land on it and warble away, which would attract our family cat.  Poor little bastard would scramble up there and teeter along the top, with all the cockys shuffling up one end.  Just when the cat thought he was almost close enough, they would all flap and hop over the cat to the other side, and cackle madly while the cat perilously tried to turn around.  Rinse, repeat until the cat would give up and slink away in disgust.

There was also an arched walkway through the fence, they thought it was a great trick to hang upside down from the arch and drive the dog crazy too.  Cheeky little buggers."

The couple split up when I was in my mid teens and they owed more on the house than it was worth by a significant margin, which is a pretty hard feat for a baby-boomer. They claimed bankruptcy in the process of divorce, had zero assets.
