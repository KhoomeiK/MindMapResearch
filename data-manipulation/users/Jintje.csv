loseit,fdbbidr,t1_fdb9tjl,1578255755.0,"I think the original commenter meant that it's more complex to find a healthy vegan diet if you're not used to it, as it does entail more steps. The vegans in my life do eat a lot more plant-based and overall healthy than I do, so it's certainly not too hard.

As long as OP doesn't see veganism as the only way to be healthy, I'm happy."
loseit,fdax6cu,t1_fdatpfy,1578251434.0,"I read my own reply back again and don't know whether I fully said OP would have to make a drastic change all at once, that wouldn't be my recommendation anyway as that's how diets usually fail. Once you're too strict, it's harder to keep up with it for a longer amount of time. Taking a first step by not drinking soda anymore, then a second step to make your hamburger at home instead of going to a fastfood restaurant, then a third step of eating low-fat yoghurt instead of full-fat yoghurt, and so on makes it way more sustainable. In the end those will add up to a drastic change, but none of these are too drastic on their own.

Going vegan all at once requires a certain amount of changes all at once, such as cutting out said burger and yoghurt together alongside many other things and replacing them with healthier and vegan alternatives. Can't have a vegan burger at McDonalds last time I checked, so now there's not just one step of making a similar beef burger at home, but a second step of figuring out what to make the burger with, both for just one food item and not to forget a lot of those changes for many food items all at once all at once. Gradually making the choice to swap that beef burger for a veggie burger and later on finding almond milk instead of regular milk and transitioning into a vegan diet that way is way more slow and therefore easier to do.

When I started my health journey I was thinking about going vegetarian and then vegan too as I come from a family of vegetarians and I've been wanting to try for a long time. For me it was too much at once, and it made it more difficult to find healthy meals to eat that would be filling enough and carried the protein I needed for 4 moments a day. As I'm now 4 months in and the changes I've made so far are here to stay, I find myself eating less and less meat as I now have the headspace to swap an animal item or two for something else. 

My conclusion is, going vegan at once requires a lot of thought and steps and tereby would be less suitable to do as you're just starting out, earning it the name complex. There's nothing wrong with transitioning into a vegan diet at a slower pace at all alongside other healthy habits."
loseit,fdatylk,t3_ekayob,1578250122.0,"I think my previous goal was to swim at least thrice this week, but I don't remember. Anyway, I made it! I swam thrice in 4 days and I really further learnt how to flip turn and I can now do it in between lengths succesfully!

For the next week I want to swim 3-4 times depending on how busy my work schedule is. I've also been looking at volume eating and I wanna incorporate a couple salads in my diet next week."
loseit,fdatex8,t1_fd658k5,1578249899.0,"The analogy that helped me the most there was one with money. Imagine you're on a budget and you end up spending a bit too much on something. Most people's reaction is to try and not do it again, and almost nobody says ""oh well, budget's ruined for the month, might as well buy that TV now!"" Yet that's what so many say when they had a slip up for the day!"
loseit,fdashvr,t1_fdao7q5,1578249531.0,"Let's actually look at the OP again. Someone at the start of their journey who asks if going vegan will be a good health swap. I'd assume that this person does indeed not eat enough high nutrition foods like the ones you listed. Maybe he/she eats a lot of processed food, simple carbs and red meat, I wouldn't know, but I'd assume so.

Once you're gonna have to make the swap to less calorie dense and more nutrition dense foods, cutting out an entire group of foods will not make things easier. A lot of recipes or snacks call for cottage cheese, yoghurt, lean meat and so on. By cutting out not only the calorie dense foods you're already eating, but a whole lot of other healthy options too, swapping is just going to be more complex for a person who's not used to eating vegan in the first place. Having a healthy diet can already be complex in the first place, with or without animal products."
loseit,fdajrqw,t1_fdacvdw,1578246865.0,"If you're not used to getting protein from non-animal products, it can take quite some time to find the right products to get the right amount, which can be harmful when exercising a lot. It's also a drastic change alltoghether"

RBNChildcare,fda4sha,t3_ekeons,1578241667.0,"IMO, we're currently living in a generation where time is way more imporant than money. Can you afford a cleaner? Great, that saves you time to do fun things with your kid(s) and husband! Is there a meal box sub you like with easy recipes? If you can afford it, it makes cooking way easier! 

Your children will remember their childhood for the time you spent with them and not for who cleaned the house. Sure, to some degree being able to cook is useful, but neither my narc and my awesome parent can cook really well and I still turned out fine."
AmItheAsshole,fd5gf06,t3_ek0h9v,1578177333.0,"I was in a similar situation where my bf kept going on and on and on about how he loved my long brown hair and hated when I cut it short and dyed it bright blue. I told him he could either suck it up or leave, because I wasn't about to change myself for him. It's just hair anyway, it'll grow out again. He chose to shut up and stay.

If he's so unaccepting of a trait of you and feels like you should listen to his rules, it's time to take the trash out and dump him. NTA"

fatlogic,fctwud5,t1_fctrk33,1577963601.0,"Additionally, having a snack doesn't necessarily mean a habit of snacking constantly.

I'm not just eating a chocolate bar spread over 3 hours of constant snacking, but I won't be eating bread and yoghurt and the apple for lunch because I don't have that long of a break anyway. Are those extra calories which don't cover the original idea of nourishment?"
Teachers,fcry7l1,t1_fcrwnmm,1577908251.0,"I got a job offer last summer by the school I'm interning at now, but declined.

This year I'm teaching about 50 classes (2 a week ish) and I think those two internships together should be enough to go try it for real!

I've strongly be adviced against it by coworkers and teachers at my degree though, because a lot of people end up prioritizing their job over their degree and drop out. As there's a huge shortage of all kinds of teachers, really, one can just work as a teacher here without a degree and once you get a job, you will only maybe be let go of once a qualified teacher applies, which happens never, so not having a degree won't be a problem.
