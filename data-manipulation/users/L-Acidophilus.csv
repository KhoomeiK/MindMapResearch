AskReddit,ffg2qqq,t1_fffzogc,1579897194.0,"2 days ago, I went to McDonald to buy a large sweet tea. It costs $1.27.  I gave her one dollar bill, a dime and a quarter. The lady put $1.30 on the machine instead of $1.35 so I got 3 cents back instead of 8 cents. So I lost 5 cents for no reason. I thought about calling the cashier out but I didnt want to go though a trouble of trying to get that 5 cents back. I am still thinking about that 5 cents to this day.. and the possibility and the opportunity of what that 5 cents can give me in the future.

I still want that 5 cents back so it can join the small cashew nut bucket that I use to keep all of my changes.. :("
