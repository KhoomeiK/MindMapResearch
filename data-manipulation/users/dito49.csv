For ease of use, a simple 3-way satellite triangle around the equator is pretty reliable for any mission that won't be on the poles. Any reasonable altitude is fine, the theoretical minimum is the planet diameter but keosynchronous satellites are coolest imo.

The first satellite is always the hardest. I'd stick to a very vertical ascent so you don't lose sight of KSC while trying to circularize. The rest should be able to see either the KSC or the other sats without too much risk of a deadzone."

Oxygen usually goes straight to the injectors, the input for those is on the top where we can't see.

Really not sure what the hole in the top center is, maybe the igniter or turbopump exhaust. It wouldn't be hydrogen or oxygen alone, since those need to be sent through an injector together to properly ignite."
KerbalSpaceProgram,feh5l85,t1_fegt3n2,1579109613.0,"With super long burns, you aren't always actually adding to your velocity in the way you want to. For example, take a prograde burn that takes exactly as long as your orbit. You'll be pointing prograde at the node, but when you start the burn you'll actually be pointing retrograde if you start at half the burn time. Pointing retrograde is exactly the opposite of what you want to do, even though it's the ""right"" direction on a solar scale it doesn't matter since you're still around Kerbin. That's beyond inefficient into detrimental. 

The key to long burns is to either split it up into several smaller burns that will all actually be in the right direction, or to, like you said, be in a higher orbit, where the relative burn time is small compared to the orbit. The former is more efficient, but the latter is easier.

If it's easier to think about the math, you will always have an angle between the direction you are pointing at and the direction your node is designed around. The 'efficiency' of your burn is the cosine of that angle, where a lower angle going on zero will be 100% efficient; my example earlier is 180^o , so cos(180) = -1 makes it 100% inefficient."

KerbalSpaceProgram,fdlvk9t,t1_fdljpst,1578533515.0,"The interstage nodes just add blank spaces in the air that you can attach to. They do not have any decouple features or whatnot. You have to add a decoupler (or engine plate, which won't leave the decoupler hanging there) in order to be able to separate anything attached to those nodes. The decoupler has to be the root part of whatever you want to detach.

The truss structure will build a truss structure between any two nodes. It covers two sides and the top of whatever it's above, but I believe it disappears if you decouple everything that is attached to the node. So using a decoupler won't get rid of it because the decoupler stays behind, but a stack separator will get rid of it since it separates from both parts.

For the Saturn V, I'd use an engine plate. You have to make sure that the engine plate is the part that attaches to the node however. I've had it happen where it looks like you attached it correctly, but you actually attached some other part of the spacecraft to the node, then it just stays there taunting you when you stage your decoupler."

Off the cuff, I'd say unless you know you need it, you can get a much cheaper motherboard and throw the money into a 2080 Super for a similar total cost. It really doesn't make a difference unless it has specific features you know you need. Same with the processor if you're just gonna be gaming, a 3700x is gonna be really similar in performance to a 3950x even for a few years yet. Also try to get 3600MHz RAM since it's not too expensive and that the PSU is actually a good model (not just high watts).

educationalgifs,fcba1b0,t1_fcb2bl1,1577584316.0,"Just because an object is near a planet doesn't necessarily mean it's going to stay there. It also has to be going slow enough so that it doesn't end up overshooting the planet and continuing on its path. For example, with New Horizons NASA flew really close to Pluto but at 22.5 km/s (50,000 mph) so it was never going to stay in orbit. That doesn't mean it is not affected by being so close though. Every time you get near a very massive object in space, you transfer a little bit of energy with it with that affects your orbit. 

What we see here is actually the Moon doing all of the work. Without it, the object would have simply flown by and if it was in orbit already, never have left. In the beginning we see the Moon pull the object in reverse to where it was headed, so it slowed down enough to actually stay in orbit. Towards the end when it got really close to the moon, the moon pulled it in the direction it was already heading so it sped up enough to leave again."
