IdiotsFightingThings,ffavo6w,t1_ffaverz,1579745562.0,Yeah I’m gonna agree almost entirely with you there.  Unless you’re using tannerite to create a lawnmower IED to fight off the Chinese this is just insanely idiotic.  What makes me mad?  This guy will get better parking spaces than me for the rest of his life because he was this incredibly dumb.

IdiotsFightingThings,ffatz0j,t1_ffato84,1579744435.0,"The rifle he was using wasn’t the issue.  He was an idiot who was standing close to an explosion inside a metal (shrapnel creating) explosion.  Tannerite isn’t that powerful and the boom isn’t really that big, but if you’re 30 yards from 3 pounds of it, you’re having a bad time even without turning a mower into shrapnel."
UpliftingNews,ff8du5m,t1_ff7lsy8,1579674341.0,"A lot of right wing protests and marches make a point during their organization beforehand to tell everyone they want to leave the place cleaner than they found it.  It’s a way of saying “we hate this thing we’re protesting, but not the country or area we’re protesting in.” It’s also a statement of values.  If your whole schtick is personal responsibility and individual initiative you better show you mean it.  Little stuff like a clean and peaceful protest can do a lot to illustrate you mean what you say."

suspiciouslyspecific,ff3a3gx,t1_ff3863a,1579537194.0,"The secret to this is to put yourself across as an interested amateur.  People will see you as someone with enough info and interest to teach you more about what they care about, rather than trying to or see if you really know as much as you claim.  It’s almost always better to be slightly self-deprecating than an insufferable know-it-all that everyone sees through.

Let’s say I meet a person who’s hobby is ham radios.  I know a little bit about it, and I find the subject interesting, but there’s a lot I can learn.  A person who is into this hobby would love to tell me all about it.  All I need to do is get them going and show I can know enough to be worth teaching and they’ll share that interest with me until I forcibly stop them.  Bam!  I made a new friend."

We’ve had enough success to know what’s wrong and expect our ownership to fix it.  They aren’t, and we’re already about to eat Mike Brown with bbq sauce anyway.  It’s easier to bash on us, because we agree with the issues with the organization.  We hate the Brown family far more than they do.

teslore,fe1yq0w,t1_fe021jx,1578832428.0,"The difference in human cruelty is almost always the twisting of morality, not abandoning it.  Hitler convinces himself he was doing the right thing.  Humans aren’t cruel because cruelty is an end in and of itself.  They’re sadists, or greedy, or sick, or they believe the ends justify the means.  The Ayleids appear to be the kind of evil you never really see.  Sapient and morally aware creatures who prefer evil and horror for its own sake.  That’s why they’re cartoonishly evil, but of course we don’t have daedra who are the embodiment of that form of evil to encourage us.  We don’t even believe that Satan is that kind of evil in Christianity.  Cruelty for its own sake is incredibly rare."

For the curious, I was walking home from school with my sister and there was a really bad thunderstorm in the area.  I saw it on the sidewalk on my road, at about 2 feet off the ground and kind of meandering for a minute till it just went away.  It was incredibly creepy and I didn’t know what it was until years later when I read about it and realized what I saw.  I also realized at that point how close to dying I was.
