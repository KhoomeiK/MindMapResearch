Cox is an outstanding actor, and this was a tour-de-force. He plays Lecter as the sort of bloke you'd have a drink with, which is how he would get close to the people he wants to kill. It's hard to see Hopkins' Lecter in that way; he's so fucking creepy a lot of people would give him a wide berth, and the others would probably find him to smart-alec and condescending.

But you have to think hard about Cox's Lecter to be terrified by him - knowing the guy who is all hail-fellow-well-met and conversational is also wicket smaht and uses his smarts to deal death and maiming, and realising that he uses his knowledge of people to dazzle them into liking him."

movies,ff9q88w,t1_ff8xmgv,1579718544.0,"I just want to expand on *Chaucer's Knight*. 

I studied Chaucer at school and Uni long before the book was published. You look at the *Reeve's Tale* and the *Miller's Tale* and the *Pardoner's Tale* and they're scatalogical and ribald and full of sharp humour poking fun at stereotypes and full of *life.*

Then there's the *Knight's Tale*, five times as long a boring as fuck. All about courtly love - where you have pine for your lady and waste away and do goodly deeds in her name and force wrongdoers to go an make obeisance to her and tell her that you were their vanquisher - but you aren't allowed to tell the object of your passion how you feel. In fact, a courtly romance that is consummated is less honourable than one that isn't. And that's what the Knight's Tale is all about - two *parfit gentil knightes* who fall in love with the same fair maid. The prevailing theory at the time was that the Knight is a boring old fart and the humour comes from the contrast between his posh view of the world and of love, and the sexual shenanigans in the other tales.

Then along came Terry Jones and blew that right out of the water. 

He shows that the description of the knight in the *Prologue* is of a vicious, greedy, mercenary - not of a 'gentil' knight at all, but a sort of cross between Black Water and a Mexican cartel member.

Viewed in that light, the tale becomes an exercise in hypocrisy, which is much more in keeping with Chaucer's critique of the whole of the society in which he lived."

Also the process of having prosecutors and judges elected. Both of these are poison, because they fail to reinforce the separation of powers.

The UK's system, while not perfect, is far, far better. Both judges and prosecutors are appointed from amongst the ranks of professional litigators (except for a very small number of academic lawyers who have been appointed to the appeal courts). The committee that appoints them also appoints its own new members, some of whom are lawyers and some of whom are already judges and some of whom are laypersons.

I think you could also do with a dose of our sub-judice laws. It's impossible (well, or least very difficult) for trials to get as distorted from their purpose in the way that the trials of, e.g., OJ Simpson, Michael Jackson, and Lindsey Lohan were in the US, because you can't report about criminal trials from the time that an indictment is made until the time the facts are aired during the trial itself. 

Prosecutors and judges can do their jobs without having to pander to the people who might otherwise elect someone else to do their job in less than four years' time.

Again, I stress, our justice system is far from perfect but it isn't additionally wrecked by politics they way yours is. It horrifies me the way people have to worry about whether the political make up of the country's supreme court might decide whether abortions are legal or whether intermediate level officials are doing their job properly or whether powerful corporations are allowed to give unlimited amounts of money to dishonest politicians."

ABoringDystopia,few7itr,t1_fev9gly,1579406448.0,That actually is a demonstration of the problem. You've turned to the constitution in order to find a problem for the failures of the constitution.

I don't know what the context is, but that sounds like shitposting. If I design a system to generate wealth for unemployed people, and it doesn't generate wealth for unemployed people, then it's not perfectly designed to fail to generate wealth for unemployed people. That's its *effect*, not its *intended effect*."

For example, in discussions about freedom of speech, and about gun owning,  a large majority of redditors will post as though 'it's in the constitution' is a final answer to the dispute. Tell them that the provisions of the constitution themselves should be subject to debate and they act as though you'd suggested that toddlers in orphanages should be carried on pitchforks."

First, I suspected that Sanders never said 'A woman can't beat Trump in 2020', but something more nuanced.

Second, if he had said that, then quoting that phrase would require the context, because that's the only way Sanders would have uttered those words. (E.G. 'Trump and his supporters are so sexist.' 'Right? A female candidate could never beat Trump in 2020'.)

Third, it's quite clear what the context would have to be, which is this: not that a woman cannot be President, but that Trump is particularly popular with people who won't vote for a woman. A male candidate might take votes from him that a female candidate could not."
