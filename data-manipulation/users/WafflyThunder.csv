WritingPrompts,fg0tf42,t3_ewak0f,1580414664.0,"Funny. It's funny how a sunset over Los Angeles turned an empty and broken city into a picture of beauty. The sands around the outskirts glowed lava-red as the sun kissed them, and the skyscrapers bathed in the glory of a dying day. Standing at a broken-out window at the top of a skyscraper, I fancied I could smell sea salt on the breeze. I closed my eyes and imagined I could hear seagulls whirling above my head, the trees rustling in an onshore wind, and the laughter of happy people enjoying the beautiful weather.

The stink of ashes reached my nose, even a thousand feet in the air, and smashed the illusion.  The world had burned on February 14th, 2020, at 6:05 pm. Valentine's Day. A meteor hail had hammered the earth, turning the crust into a broken crust of what it once was. The shield of stone that had protected us from the blood of the earth was shattered, and as the world bled, we burned with it.

I closed my eyes once more and remembered. I remembered the roses, wilting in the heat of the raging inferno that was once my house. I remembered the feel of roasted flesh, pulling off the bone in my hands. I remembered last words, whispered into my ears as the world burned around us. I remembered the wolf of hunger, gnawing at my stomach as I wandered the countryside. I remembered the warmth of a bonfire, and the so, so delicious stew simmering over it. I remembered the feel of a blanket wrapped around me, and falling asleep in front of a fire. I remembered a knife, dancing along the skin of my throat. I remembered the snap a neck made as it broke. I remembered the fresh skull, hidden in the shadows behind the tent. I remembered, and as I did, the hopelessness rose within me.

For what was I? A single ant, scrabbling around in the dirt? A speck of miserable life, desperately scrabbling, hoarding resources to preserve my own selfish life for one more day? What was the point? When I died, all my efforts would have been in vain. The only mark I would have made on the world would be scratches on the wall, mad ramblings written in an increasingly violent hand, reflecting the descent of my mind into madness. 

I can feel it. The madness. Eight years it has been without a single human voice. So precious, so fleeting. I held silence for the first six years, two months, eight days, and seven hours. Then I uttered a word, just to see how my voice sounded. Just one word. 

""Mother.""

Was I ashamed? No. For to me, the word mother represented cookies in a warm kitchen on a Sunday afternoon. Mother represented a soothing voice in the dark, comforting after a nightmare. Mother represented security, a shield between me and the stark realities of the world.

All of which was gone, burned in an instant of smoke and fire.

After I spoke, it was hard to stop. Even when I didn't want it to, my voice rambled on, babbling about anything and everything. Even when the voice went from talk about regret, to anger. To revenge. To murder. To torture. 

It was driving me to insanity. I couldn't stand it anymore. So one day, I found a piece of glass. A nice, big one. Sharp. So sharp. And I took away the voice. But it didn't want to stop. Even now, I can feel the stump waggling around in my mouth. Trying to speak. Trying so desperately to speak.

I am the last one.

I set my radio to play ""Survivor."" And I took the noose. So nice it felt in my hands. Like freedom. And I hung it from the ceiling.

So easy to kick away the chair. I close my eyes, and wait for the end. 

And at that moment, my survival radio squawked over the voice of the woman crooning the lyrics. 

""Hello?! Is anybody there?!"" The voice was sobbing. 

I must get down. I have to. I must, I must, I must. I must get down! I MUST!

The knife slips from my fingers onto the floor. I yank at the knot around my throat, desperate to get down, to let the unknown girl know. That I am here. That she is not alone. 

Her voice goes on and on. ""Please! Please answer me if you're there! I need someone to talk to, I need someone...PLEASE!""

Her voice turns into sobbing. 

My vision starts turning black. Right before I lose consciousness, I hear the crack of a gunshot over the radio. A thump.

And I gasp out my life on the end of a rope.

Nature, after six thousand years, has finally won."
