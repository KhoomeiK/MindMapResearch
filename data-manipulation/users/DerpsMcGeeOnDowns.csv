If your knee-jerk response to this is that 1) McConnell sucks and blah blah or 2) can you imagine if Obama did the same thing?? or 3) anything along those lines, you aren’t helping formulate solutions. 

Yes we know that politicians, especially the GOP, are complete hypocrites. Case closed. 

Yes we know McConnell sucks. Fact. 

Yes we know Trump sucks and that he is obviously guilty. Clearly. 

But why do you think none of that matters?

It’s because many Americans are so angry that they can no longer reason. Their judgment is clouded. They sure as fuck aren’t listening to us. They don’t care because their life isn’t what it could be and they are fucking mad. 

That anger is total. It’s not up for debate. 

We need to stop with the cliche responses and actually do something about these issues and talk about solutions. If we don’t have solutions for these people, they will continue to have Trump as their avatar and the rest of the world will suffer as a result of their discontent."

Trump is willing to risk all out war not because he understands the nuclear deal, but because it’s yet another Obama win that he wants to destroy. Diplomats are on record for stating Obama supported or didn’t support things as a way to get Trump to act.

Of course I don’t believe DoD. They are an arm of Trump just like DoJ. And if you listen to the Republican feedback from the briefing they got on the killing, it was the “worst they have ever heard.” 

The same people praising this shit are the same people calling DoD the deep state last week. It would be hilarious if it weren’t so serious.

Unilateral moves happen all the time and are executed by many countries, not just the United States. The difference in this case is that our attack was surgical. Their attacks—plural—have been blanketed.

Are we supposed to just let this terrorist continue to plan more attacks that kill and/or injure more people? And if your answer to that is yes, then at what point does he cross your line and need to be dealt with? 

You seem to think this was an act of aggression, which tells me you have no idea what actually has taken place here. 

How many more acts of terrorism are you specifically willing to let happen before killing the person and people responsible for them?
