aww,fee6epl,t1_fee4tsh,1579027353.0,"Yup. My parents also told us from an early age. I don't remember having a ""talk"" about it. They somehow made it seem as if they chose me so, as a kid, I always thought I was a little more special than my friends who were with their biological families. After all, my parents chose me, theirs got stuck with them. lol"

bestoflegaladvice,fcr9pce,t3_eih7t0,1577898810.0,"Honestly seeing lots of wrong information by people who don't know how Law 101 works. The person absolutely can be reprimanded for speaking English to a coworker while working. If it was a personal conversation not related to work, absolutely not, but in their official duties they can be. It depends on the number of employees. Off the top of my head, it is either above 35 or 50 employees, the language of work must be French. Its doesn't apply to small businesses."
bestoflegaladvice,fcr7shw,t1_fcqsw6b,1577898026.0,"Twice the size, not 3 times. 
You do not need to say ""Bonjour"" but in businesses over a certain number of employees, the language of work must be French. 
Bonjour/ hi is not outlawed."
