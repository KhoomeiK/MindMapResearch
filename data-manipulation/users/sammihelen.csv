TrueOffMyChest,fdhkjm7,t3_elam6b,1578424599.0,"I just kicked out my boyfriend of two years. I gave him months and months of notice.

He is not facing homelessness. He has a job. He’s facing going back to a cockroach-infested home his parents live in. But he hasn’t saved a money or taken any step to be in dependent. 

He’s 32. I’m 27. 

He had time. Your man definitely had time.

I know these are not the same situations at all. But if you need someone to talk to who has spent six years between two guys who couldn’t figure their shit out, message me.

I know you’re in pain. I know you’re sad. I know you want the best for him, that’s clear.

But.. he had time. That is not on you. Depression sucks, drug habits suck, whatever his issue is I’m sure is heartbreaking, but you have a life to live. 

Go live it."

AmItheAsshole,fcw660j,t3_ehw713,1578018053.0,"Want to know what ended my last relationship?? My boyfriend had a bunch of qualms with me that he told people who weren’t me. Even when I repeatedly asked what was up, and especially because he told people who didn’t know me, and I found out the hard way. I wasn’t cheated on. I was put down very passively and it looked a lot like the comments you’re making. 

I don’t know you, but your little remarks about your wife speak volumes whether or not you see it. One thing I learned from my last relationship was that belittling the other person doesn’t fix anything. Internet stranger or not — and I’m betting it isn’t just us you’re venting to — you’re putting that energy out there. So maybe she sucks too. Honestly, she might, I might have, some relationships just aren’t good anymore. Who knows, I don’t. 

But holy shit to not reflect on what you’re saying and how you’re saying it as something detrimental to your relationship is ridiculous and delusional. You are hurting things too; you are hurting her *obviously* and maybe she flew off the handle about something small... I mean, one of my last fights with my boyfriend was about dishes. But it wasn’t about dishes at all. And this isn’t about your love for your child, it’s about a relationship that is hurting right now, regardless of who is more at fault. You both need to fight for this relationship right now. Idk your wife. She isn’t asking AITA right now... you are, and yeah, you’re being an asshole for passively putting her down."

Atlanta,fcf0ft7,t1_fcb6jgr,1577625443.0,"Put the litter back inside! This doesn’t work. It attracts feral cats.

I lost my cat in an outdoor area that he had never been outside in. I was doing *everything* wrong. If people are walking around frantically calling for your kitty, make them stop. Go open a can of tuna (this works because the scent is so strong). Talk as if it’s feeding time, do not call. If the person(s) calling out sound panicked or alarmed, your cat is going to feel that panic and alarm.

Your cat is more than likely hunkered down nearby keeping an eye on the property and waiting for a safe time to return. For my cat, this meant TOTAL DARKNESS (no lights on inside either), and it meant opening the window he got out of all the way. Seriously. This was all it took. This was after three days of searching/walking around outside/calling out for him. I literally flicked a light off and opened the window he got out of widely at about 5 am. He jumped back in the window not five minutes later. This might mean your pet sitter needs to leave a door opened. I get this might be hard, but it also might be necessary. 

I also recall that I was told only to call my cat by his name from my actual property, and if I was canvassing the neighborhood to use terms like “baby” and “kitty”. 

I would not have found my cat without a group called “Lost Cats of GA” on Facebook. They showed me just how incorrectly I was doing everything. If you’re on FB, I would look up their page and share on there as well, I’ve linked to an article on their webpage below -
