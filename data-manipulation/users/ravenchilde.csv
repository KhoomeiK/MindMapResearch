Skeet skeet skeet  
She do that thang for three retweet  
Her nails were painted silver fair  
And silver were her highlights made  
Her prow was fashioned like a swan  
And that is what I came upon  
I asked Elon of he’d like to meet  
He looked back, said, “hell yeah let’s eat”"

Calgary,fh453fi,t1_fh3knqg,1581275302.0,Macroblocking at its finest.
canada,fh1umbr,t1_fh1amex,1581224701.0,Thanks again Jmoney.
canada,fh1i432,t1_fh1amex,1581215773.0,Can you message me? I have CBD and anxiety questions best kept for private. But I don’t want to message you so as to not be a bother. I’ll just leave this note here and if you respond then I’ll ask. Thanks.
canada,fh0sobc,t1_fh0slh8,1581207098.0,I agree with your premise.
canada,fgzsv10,t1_fgy9w0s,1581197270.0,"Right now the top comments are mostly wishing him well from what I saw, and discussing how hard Benzos are. Even from folks who don’t like what comes out of his mouth."
canada,fgzslqb,t1_fgyxcrj,1581197177.0,He isn’t. He’s too intelligent. But he’s an asshole and attention seeker (my opinion). Not always good qualities. But common ones.
canada,fgzs1ok,t1_fgxip2n,1581197091.0,"True. I think he often says things that make him sound like a right cunt-y-asshole for someone so clearly intelligent. 

But torture and addiction is a step too far. I wish him the best, and a more positive and caring outlook going forward."
canada,fgzrqec,t1_fgyd9jc,1581196988.0,"They are great for things like laser eye surgery. They give you exactly one 1mg dose and you don’t care that you can smell the laser ablating your cornea. You don’t care that you think you can feel the laser. 

It’s all good man."
canada,fgzreev,t1_fgyd9jc,1581196860.0,"Or insomnia. That’s the harder one if you are using it to relieve sleep anxiety. Tapering off can just lead to days of not sleeping. 

This literally destroys your life and the life of folks who love you."
canada,fgzr1x8,t1_fgy5sxh,1581196789.0,"I like he has a lot of stupid ideas, and seeks attention too much. 

That being said, I wouldn’t wish this harm on even my enemies (and I don’t know the guy and he isn’t one)."
canada,fgzqpjq,t1_fgz4p7u,1581196664.0,Water. You forgot water. I just can’t quit it.
canada,fgzqgeq,t1_fgybid5,1581196573.0,Yeah... it doesn’t work like that. When the site PaxilProgress was up there was story after story about people being unable to quit with tapering.
canada,fgzq0ns,t1_fgy9va8,1581196510.0,"I’ve seen it. The cravings don’t go away, or insomnia kicks in and the person stops sleeping and starts losing their mind. Worst months of my life and hard to watch someone go through."
ImaginaryMindscapes,fgzpalf,t3_f0l0hh,1581196288.0,I like it.
