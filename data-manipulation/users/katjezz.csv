Medieval Europe had a similar view on children as china does today. Meaning male children were more desirable. In china, the one-child-policy created a very large surplus of men for somewhat few women. Its a very common issue in China and is the reason the foreigner arranged marriage industry is so big in china. 

Medieval Europe was very similar. While a family had a lot of children, few reached maturity. You needed a male child to take over the family business once the patriarch died. Having a daughter had no merits outside of arranged marriages for powert or politics. 

Of course the amount of men in marriage was drastically higher (percentage, not total number) than today. Christianity, just like islam today, forced women to go into marriage or face a live of being shunned (like incels today) for not having a husband. So naturally you had a higher amount of males in ""relationships"".

Today, in the age of dating apps, a women can chose any men she wants. This leads to a severe effect in which the vast majority (78%) of women aims for the top 20 percent of men ( [blah blah](https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a) )

I am not saying they are bad. I enjoy the FFXIV raids much more because they are easier. WoW is now build upon layers and layers of weak auras and other addons and the only way for blizzard to counter that is by adding absolutely insanely difficult bosses with tons of abilities, phases and damage checks. its absurd and its killing the games guilds. Just look at the past few ""race to world first"" streams of WoW. Took them weeks playing 16 hours a day. 

As example, ""The Eternal Palace"" in WoW was released July 9th and it took Method until July 28 to clear it on mythic. 16+ hours a day. Of course Splitfarming is also mandatory which means that you need at least 5 alt characters all equally geared and catched up with all progression mechanics on each player so you can funnel gear to mains. And even after that it took them that long to kill Azshara on Mythic. 

The average guild takes up to 6-9 months to clear the raid, some more. 3-5 Days a Week, 3-4 hours each raid day."
MMORPG,fekvosc,t3_epoymc,1579208563.0,"WoW. Either Classic or Retail. These are the only ones solely based around PvE. 

Retail WoW (BfA) is pretty bad but the raids are still the best you will find. FFXIV Has the best visuals, but the raids just teleport you from boss to boss and the difficulty is not that high. The game has also no other endgame systems were as WoW has Mythic+. GW2 has Raids as well but they have no rewards and can be done with 4 people. GW2 also sells its ingame currency through the cash shop for real dollars and you can use that gold then to buy almost BiS gear from the market. 

Story wise wow is kinda trash if you are not into the warcraft lore. FFXIV has ""good"" story but only in its latest expansion, and you gonna have to take about 100hours before you get there because the game forces a very tedious main story upon you with infinite ""travel across the world to talk to NPC and then return"". You do this a thousand times. FFXIV has also no class customization, there are no talents and gear has a rather insignificant impact. Basically no theorycrafting since everyone plays every class the same, by design. This was done to even the playing field between console and PC players who play on the same servers.

Don't go looking for stories in MMO's, they dont have the budged or scope to achieve anything.
