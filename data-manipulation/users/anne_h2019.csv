BollyBlindsNGossip,feo0j57,t3_epxhq5,1579293517.0,"You know, I don't appreciate this blind one bit. Why do we care about the woman in question? Why is it about the woman always in a prostitution racket? You say it is high profile, right? Then let us have a blind naming the businessmen and industrialists who slept with these so called prostitutes. 

Stop dumping the entire narrative onto the woman. Bring out the people who drive the demand and allow these business to flourish in the first place."

BollyBlindsNGossip,fekdwck,t3_epk31v,1579198005.0,"It is not a love story, it is one narcissistic guy manipulating a dumbass woman into a relationship where they both believe it is love. The toxicity, in the movie as well as the director's personal pov , is disturbing to the core. That director is one disturbed human being if he thinks what he made was how love is, if slapping your partner is an expression of love. Plain mental.


Should it, however be allowed to be made ? Definitely yes. In the end it is art and it does not need to adhere to lofty ideals like social responsibility and Civic sense. Because you cannot essentially censor art. No one person gets to decide what should be expressed or not. At this rate, why do you allow item songs in the movies? Why do you allow movies where a heroine is helpless untill rescued by hero? Why do you allow movies like KKHH where the hero is propagating chauvinism and shallow male gaze? Why do you allow movies like Dangal where the father forces his daughters into a career they never wanted in the first place, screw their potential? Why do you allow movies like Bahubali where the heroine is drawn on, tattooed and primarily violated by the hero in the name of a romantic song? Why do you allow movies like Befikre or Grand Masti or Houseful ? How do all these get to be made if you really cared about social responsibility?


You get my drift? You cannot censor one man's pov which becomes a cinema by the society's ideals. Cinema was never meant to be society's watchdog. It is an expression of a truth and truth is always subjective. In Kabir Singh's eyes, he has done nothing wrong and he is a great lover and this movie is his story. Stop crying toxic when every other movie has objectionable material and take it like it should be taken, as an artform, which you needn't agree with also. Hate it but allow it the right to exist.


Can you imagine that if Hollywood did the same, we would have masterpieces like Psycho, The Shining, Mad Max Fury Road or even the latest Killing Eve ? Because they treat art as what it is, as an expression. And they combat society as they should, through established processes in law and order. Does it have it's limitations, yes, like any flawed society, they can't enforce it 100% , but atleast they don't go start finding stupid ass reasons like social responsibility to blame their movies in the first place."
