WTF,ffzsqkc,t1_ffzrg69,1580391817.0,"Vulgarity doesn't just mean ""rude"" (though even ""rude"" doesn't mean what it did). Euphemisms are an attempt to ""rise above"" lowly human functions, whether it's shitting or eating, by using alternative words to describe those things. I would argue that today the words are even more euphemistic than they used to be, with plenty of people entirely dissociating the meat from the animal, hence my showerthought about lamb which is the perfect counter example to my argument."
Futurology,ffzsay4,t1_ffyaz5w,1580391461.0,"Like military projects unbuilding infrastructure overseas are on time and on budget?

There is *plenty* of budgetary flexibility to be had just by reining in that one five-sided department."
Futurology,ffzs52e,t1_ffy7a5i,1580391322.0,"Why fix US infrastructure? By spending a mere 2 trillion dollars overseas bombing *their* infrastructure, US infrastructure gets relatively better!"
WTF,ffzr7j7,t1_ffzqq44,1580390535.0,"It's bizarre: the egg industry grinds up useless eggless male chicks, and the meat chicken industry grinds up useless small female chicks (yeah, yeah, they're different breeds, but still, shows how little foresight we have when selective breeding)."

WTF,ffzqf8s,t1_ffzq181,1580389846.0,That one's more of a reverse euphemism. We actually eat a whole lot of cock.
WTF,ffzq9bx,t1_ffzpwrd,1580389695.0,"They're still euphemisms. Plenty of euphemisms are made by using foreign words, as the local word is the word of the common person and therefore more vulgar by definition. In this case, yes, the original purpose wasn't euphemism."
patientgamers,ffzpyti,t1_ffzpdo8,1580389430.0,"Given it's beyond your comprehension, you seem strangely sure of that."
