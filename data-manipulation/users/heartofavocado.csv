The first bullet journal I bought was the Leuchtturm 1917 and I hated it - so much bleeding and ghosting and the pages were super thin. I think this is a great bullet journal to get started too because like you said, the quality and price are pretty pretty good! I use fountain pens and brush pens in it and still have no issues and I love that they come in so many sizes. 

I'm glad you like my mood tracker and I hope it works out for you! :)"

collapse,ffk5du0,t1_ffk0btl,1580016411.0,That's a pretty fucked up thing to say.

bulletjournal,ffjvfdr,t1_ffjv51m,1580008031.0,"Maybe you can try stickers to spruce things up! I'm not too artsy so I use a lot of stickers in my spreads which makes things look pretty and exciting to use. Also, I've seen some people print pictures and glue them in for aesthetics which might be another idea."
veganrecipes,ffjuw2c,t3_eu0whm,1580007611.0,This looks mouthwateringly delicious!
Frugal,ffjuqfj,t3_eu020w,1580007487.0,"As long as you keep eating out and expensive tours/activities to a minimum, you should be fine! I spent 2 months in Europe (9 days in Paris) under 2K sharing the costs with only one other person, so a week with a group of friends should definitely be doable on that budget!"
ZeroWaste,ffjudva,t3_eu0zzt,1580007205.0,I love that you made the granola from the left over pulp!
bulletjournal,ffjubdx,t3_eu0xaa,1580007152.0,"The best advice is to start off not being artsy at all! Keep your spreads simple and functional and don't worry about what it looks like - focus on whether or not the spread is adding value to your life and is helping you be more productive. 

My monthly go-to spreads are Monthly page (calendar with important dates as well as a small section for monthly goals and future events), mood tracker, habit tracker, notes (brain dump basically), finances (financial brain dump lol), and of course my weeklys which depending on the month can span a few days or even 2 weeks. 

On a yearly basis, I like my goals page as well as my book list. I also like progress trackers for projects I'm working on, they will keep me motivated. 

When I first started bullet journaling, I tried to be super artsy (and failed) and the imperfection made the whole bujo thing a highly anxiety-inducing event which caused me to quickly give it up. When I came back to it a few months later with a more minimalist/functional perspective, it became one of the favorite parts of my daily life!"

NewTubers,ffiagjk,t3_etsjj1,1579969201.0,"Hi! My name is Tapasya and I have a lifestyle channel called Heart of Avocado where I make videos on minimalism, sustainability, productivity, wellness, and more! Here's my most recent video on How to Manage Stress in which I share 5 of my favorite strategies: https://youtu.be/euRW11jFSjs

One surprising thing I've learned is that the videos you think will do good, don't always end up doing so and sometimes the videos you hate end up doing really good lol One of my top videos at the moment is one I wasn't even going to post because I thought the lighting was terrible."

minimalism,ff6phyh,t1_ff683gc,1579632165.0,"Disposable water bottles were of my BIGGEST offenders a few years ago, so I totally relate! I use a 5 gallon bottle that I fill up at my local grocery store every two weeks or so and have 2 Hydroflasks and I'm happy to say that it's been a loooonnng time since I've bought a disposable water bottle. 

I'm still working on my paper towel addiction though and I'm slowly trying to switch over to cloth. I love the plastic shoe box idea for the laundry room - I'm going to give that a try :)"

povertyfinance,ff58uqd,t1_ff566no,1579583697.0,"I totally agree with your point and it's probably not worth the extra hassle in a lot of cases. I also think it varies a lot based on your location, for example where I live, the gas between the expensive station and the cheap station can vary by as much as $0.35 which adds up to around $10-20 a month depending on how much you drive, but I know in some places the variation may not be so big in which case it probably wouldn't be worth the extra hassle."
bujo,ff4drzc,t1_ff2gyx2,1579561218.0,I believe it's probably a Walmart product because I tried searching for it and couldn't find it anywhere else online.
bujo,ff2o64c,t1_ff2ne3o,1579515907.0,Thank you! :)
povertyfinance,ff29xjk,t1_ff29buf,1579498179.0,"300/week on food/gas is definitely a lot. What stores do you currently shop at? Switch over to shopping at cheaper places like Aldi, Winco, Food for Less, FoodMaxx, etc. I would suggest making a meal plan and then going into the store with a shopping list so you're not tempted to buy things you don't need. Also, I would strongly recommend going a whole week without buying any groceries at all and using up what's in your pantry in order to force yourself to get in the habit of getting creative in the kitchen and using up pantry items. Meal prepping can also help you save a lot of money when it comes to food! 

For gas, what gas mileage does your car get? Would it be possible to carpool for work to get some help with gas? Also, where do you currently gas up - there are apps out there to see which station in your local area offers the cheapest price. Personally, I never notice any difference between gas from Chevron/Shell vs QuickStop or other off-brand stations, so go for the cheaper option. 

Try to buy things in bulk, and buy in season produce. Also, I would recommend checking out the cash envelope budgeting method, that might help too!"
povertyfinance,ff28c7y,t3_er8d56,1579496755.0,"1060 a month is a HUGE amount for gas, food, and essentials. Cut that down to about 350 and throw the rest away at your debt until it's gone :) You mention a mortgage, can you potentially rent out a room for an extra side income?"
