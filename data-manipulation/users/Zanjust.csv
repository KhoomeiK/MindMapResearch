Rabbits,ffsbf2b,t1_ffs4de2,1580177714.0,I figured everyone would miss Ping in the back.
Rabbits,ffsb7zj,t1_ffrxrh0,1580177584.0,"Yes It started with 1 bun(the big white one with grey ears) then we got 2 ""girl"" holland lops turns out one was a boy(he's on the right in this post). By the time we checked to make sure, it was too late. We had a litter of 6 and 2 peanuts. 4 we placed with 2 families but 1 set had to come back because they found out their child was extremely allergic. After worrying that who ever we gave them to would just lock them in a cage by themselves for 99% of their life, we decided to keep the last 4. After neutering everyone we started bonding the babies and adults so at the moment 5 are housed together and the other 2 on the otherside of them."

After watching the last 2-3 episodes of season 1, I was thinking this is the bitchyist serial killer ever. He's pretty fucking stupid too.

Family courts are very biased in favor of the mother though, so many men feel they're being screwed with little chance of getting a fair shake. Then theres people out there paying exorbitant amounts of money a month with only a small fraction actually going to support the child, the rest going into the pocket of the spouse.
