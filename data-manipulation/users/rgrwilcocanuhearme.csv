nottheonion,femtg1o,t1_femqb43,1579269116.0,"As someone who was abused as a child and was familiar with that popular assertion that most people who hurt children were hurt as children themselves, I was actually afraid of hurting children and would avoid being around them or looking at them because I was terrified of my potential proclivity toward such destructive actions.

I've since found out that despite a majority of child predators having been abused as children, only a small minority of people who were abused as children then go on to become child predators. I've never really had any impulses about children like that, thankfully, and hopefully I never will.

All that said, I don't feel as though having those impulses makes you an inherently bad person - I don't think your impulses or feelings can really be immoral in and of themselves, rather that would be dictated by how you act upon them.

Now, I'm not an expert in either field, but I tend to think of it as a similar sort of issue as, say, an addiction. You've got two groups of people who, typically, come from a tragic background, and you've got two groups of people who have these impulses to engage in behaviors that are ultimately destructive to society. These are people who, I believe, deserve our empathy and support. These are people who, I believe, with the proper environment and support structures, are capable of living happy, healthy, fulfilling lives, contributing to society, without engaging in these destructive behaviors. There are plenty of former addicts who demonstrate this every day.

I suspect there are people out there who have those sorts of impulses who never act out upon them, though obviously there's no statistics on that (that I'm aware of). I can't imagine how difficult that must be without any support structures available to them. As far as it being a systemic issue, I do agree, to some extent, and would say that there needs to be some kind of support structure out there for these people. Perhaps it could be manifested as a part of a broader support structure for people who have been abused as children in general? I don't know. Mental health support in many western countries - America especially, from my personal experience - is dramatically lacking.

All that said, I'd be apprehensive to make the assertion that ""there's nothing wrong with having these kinds of thoughts,"" because I'd be worried about normalizing it and making people comfortable with having these thoughts. I think it's important to acknowledge how destructive these actions are, and that having these thoughts leads directly toward those destructive actions. We need to stress the importance of these thoughts and impulses being problems that need to be addressed - just in a way involving more empathy, understanding and support than outright hostility and ostracization."
