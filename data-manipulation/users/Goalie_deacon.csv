Then they punished every Irishman who enlisted in the British military for stopping Germany from killing more Brits."

hockey,ffvvt3v,t1_ffvp0kn,1580274765.0,"Well, the movie is almost 30 years old.  Great One would've never been great without goons.  There's a documentary about goons, and every player interviewed says the same thing, goons is how players like Gretzky got the numbers they did.  Anyway, triple deke only works if the goalie kind of goes to sleep, and the shooter pulls a fast wrister.  However, the number of dekes is not something a shooter should ever do the same every time.  Goalies pick up on that.  I know I do.  I know the players who always shoot the upper corners, and those who can't raise the puck.  Guessing when the wrister is coming is the only thing going for the shooter.  A set number makes my day easier."

hockey,ffum20x,t1_ffugllr,1580244820.0,Triple deke isn't much.  I see squirts pulling off that move.  Charlie was U16 in D3.  He should've had much more than that to impress anyone.
hockey,ffulpuj,t1_ffsslsi,1580244614.0,"I say it's because hockey has much better trash talk than most other sports.  Football doesn't have that many different cultures on the same field together, and baseball don't play close enough to trash talk on the field.  While hockey has Canadians, Russians, Swedes, Fins, Norwegians, and so on.  Once they all get on the same language, insults get creative.  So these former hockey players turned commentators have a long time thinking and speaking in a hurry.  Also fewer head injuries than football.

I've watched a Russian play trade insults with a Canadian player, and it was funny.  Russian didn't speak a word of English, and Canadian player can't speak Russian.  But they sure got their points across, since the Canadian player charged the Russian.  I enjoyed it, because the Russian plays for my team, and he was laughing as he punched the other guy."
Justrolledintotheshop,ffukjkh,t1_ffuifb3,1580243897.0,"We were on a convoy to an amusement park with friends from church.  A few cars, and one RV.  A trucker had a blowout that directly took someone's car out.  There was debris everywhere.  I was the first car through, and quickly tried getting my wife to call the RV to warn them, but too late.  They lost a tire to the debris.  We found out the spare was dry rotted, and we didn't get much further, before we all had to leave the expressway to limp the RV to a tire shop.  We lost 3 hours that day, one hour changing the first one, 2 hours at the shop.  Sad difference when considering they have tools.  We were quicker with one hand tool."

Fascinating thing is my boss and I were just talking about this yesterday.  He used to make much more money in previous jobs, and he said he never once thought about what it cost to pay for healthcare.  Back then, he was paying for a whole family, and it didn't scratch his spending habits.  Now, every bit of what it cost hurts to even think about it.  So many Americans are in the ""not poor enough"" group.  But thing is, the ""not poor enough"" people can't go without insurance, because the IRS fines for that now.  Whether you get sick or not, they're pulling money out of our pockets we need to pay our other bills.  Necessary bills, like utilities and rent/mortgage."
