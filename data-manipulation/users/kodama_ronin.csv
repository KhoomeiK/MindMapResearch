YangForPresidentHQ,ferndv6,t1_fer5b53,1579356086.0,"I did, but no response yet.

from u/-MrWrightt- who also wrote them and received a response:
""We get brigaded pretty regularly by their community. It's nearly impossible to tell the good faith posts from the bad. So a lot of them get banned to stop the brigading. We've been re-evaluating recently since they have slowed down the brigading. Believe me, we are concerned about this too. The main issue is just that we ban one for brigading, they post about how they got banned, and then suddenly we have 30 posts about Yang. """
YangForPresidentHQ,fepdovh,t1_fepd97h,1579317959.0,That's actually a pretty reasonable response. Their job cannot be easy. Hopefully people at least get a chance to protest their ban. On r/conservative I've been perma-banned countless times for just commenting with logic and reason.
YangForPresidentHQ,fepdi81,t1_fepdff0,1579317833.0,"Actually, you can! Lol. Hi"
YangForPresidentHQ,fepcmbg,t1_fepc9io,1579317232.0,"I don't condone their censoring and banning of comments. Maybe you misread what I wrote. Removing low quality or repeat submissions i get, removing comments I don't.

And I work with single mothers. They must pool and it's not the certified child sitter that you're imagining."
YangForPresidentHQ,fepbwbx,t1_fep84x9,1579316748.0,"I've been looking over at https://www.reveddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/
and it doesn't seem too unreasonable, the removed posts. Personally, I don't believe in banning people for comments, unless they go against broad Reddit policy. 

Sadly, single mothers cannot afford a personal sitter for her kids in this day and age. Kids get pooled together, or they have family (typically grandma) watch the kids as they work."

politics,fdxtazj,t1_fdxr0jv,1578772690.0,But you will save money under Bernie's plan. You just don't make sense at all. It seems you don't want everyone to win. You want some to win and others to hurt. Maybe Bernie is not for you. Trump makes more sense.

Similar concept, but different outcomes."

politics,fdt358q,t1_fdt1145,1578711305.0,"In the field I work in, insurers have the privilege of paying only about 90%-75% of what services would cost out of pocket.

I'm also no expert, but I lived abroad for more than half my life and used to laugh (and sometimes cry) at my friends and family in the US whenever we compared health care costs. Nowadays I'm scared to death of chipping a tooth. Bernie's plans are basically more in line with the systems I used to enjoy in South Korea, Canada and Japan."

politics,fdsy5u8,t1_fdsvm1j,1578709470.0,"Well at the moment, I fall into that under-insured category. I go abroad for major operations or dental work. With a medicare for all plan, you cut the red tape of providers having to scramble to inquire about individuals' eligibility with their insurers and you would be able to visit any hospital of your choosing, reducing the time people need to use to research about facilities that take their insurance and then traveling to it. Too much money at the moment is going to the middle man, which would be completely freed up under Bernie's plan. Medical providers are also currently being undercut by large insurance companies. They're not getting the rates that would make it worth their while to provide services. I know this because I work in the health care industry. Every year nowadays there is some ""mistake"" and rates are reduced, which then requires hours of fighting with these companies to get them to pay out as was promised.

And speaking of resource scarcity, wouldn't it be great to reduce the cost of tertiary education, so we can encourage more young people to become doctors? Also, we can import doctors. There is no lack of immigrants who want to come to live in the US."

We can knock that down easily and make public colleges, state universities and public trade schools tuition free by simply reversing the $1.5Trillion in tax cuts to the billionaires under Trump. From an economic viewpoint, that would be a much better economic stimulus, not only in the short term by giving millions of people expendable income from having their loans freed, but more importantly, will fuel economic growth in the future. People claim that Trump was great for their 401K. Well, you know what? You've been cheated out of a pension! And what's more is that your 401K will stagnate as the population ages and skilled workers leave the workforce. You can see that happening all over the world. The recent rise in the stock market is another bubble! Those tax cuts for the rich went into inflating stocks to make it seem like our industries are thriving. It is all a farce. Look abroad and look to history for ample evidence that investing in low-cost, high quality education is an economic stimulus. Environmental deregulation and tax evasion by the rich will eventually catch up to every nation and hit hard."
