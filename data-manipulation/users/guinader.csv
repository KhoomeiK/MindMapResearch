AskMen,fephne4,t3_eq2bom,1579320737.0,"I'm not saying I'm going looking, probably average, but just like women when Dressed well and well groomed i probably jump 1-2 points in the scale, and I witness this first hand.  

I'm usually just a shadow on the background of people's daily lives, but a few years ago I had a beard trim, I was lifting regularly (looked skinny athletic) and was well dressed.  

I noticed women starting at me ( I thought something was wrong with me like a zipper open) and a few interactions I had on the day (get coffee, etc) i was given preferrence when making my coffee, and another lady was basically loss for words, like stumbled on her words, giggled, as she tried to answer my question.   

It was a very bizarre day and only a few days later I finally dawn on me what had happened.  

I can was probably an 8 that day, vs my normal 5-6... It's a big difference but I still have no idea how it would feel being an 9-10"

*Walk towards victim, sprint a little, thinks it's silly and it must not be real, so walks again towards victim, then realize it must be real and sprint for it.    

After my this first rescue my headguard told me: if you think the victim is actually drowning (in trouble) just run for!    

Worst case scenario they were ok and a silly laugh occurs but you can tell people you were ready to save a life.  Best case it was a real victim and you saved their life like a Hero!"
