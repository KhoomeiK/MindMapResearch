todayilearned,ffu8bj6,t1_ffu6lan,1580236608.0,I usually have to scroll down too far in posts like this to find someone else in transfusion medicine. Keep sharing the knowledge!
todayilearned,ffu84ur,t1_fftxjx9,1580236494.0,Blood bank specialist here. It’s a great idea in theory but making sure it’s a safe and stable product takes time. It takes a long time for the FDA (in the US) and other regulating agencies in other countries to approve practices like this.
mydadwroteaporno,ffu75ls,t1_ffu4yvp,1580235914.0,"I think you’re on to something…

I used to believe the alien theory but nope. She’s definitely a Sims."
mydadwroteaporno,ffu4o79,t1_fftih6l,1580234417.0,This is honestly the best theory I’ve ever heard.
AskReddit,ff22s80,t1_ff0r8h1,1579492243.0,Tornado sirens instantly cause me to panic. My heart rate increases even when I know it’s just a test.
howyoudoin,few3knn,t3_eqmi8f,1579404854.0,Genius!
AskReddit,fesakg7,t1_feqs8lp,1579363267.0,I saw them in New Orleans on the On The Run tour so pre-Lemonade. The show started like 2 hours late and they played videos between songs so it turned into a really long night. BUT the show was really good. I do think they’re very egotistical people though.
AskReddit,fes5jpw,t1_fery820,1579361634.0,I still listen to Two Lefts Don’t Make A Right But Three Do sometimes
AskReddit,fes58ng,t1_fes169f,1579361516.0,I saw Norma Jean a few years ago at a small dive bar. Still sounded pretty good!
BostonTerrier,fekebcl,t3_ephi55,1579198254.0,Mine doesn’t have a tail. Just a little squishy bit of skin where a tail should be lol
harrypotterwu,fdq67vd,t1_fdpbseg,1578656651.0,Thanks! I didn’t even realize it was my cake day until I posted the comment lol
harrypotterwu,fdpb03h,t3_emey8t,1578624147.0,Best thing I’ve ever seen on this sub. Maybe even reddit lol
medlabprofessionals,fdllocp,t1_fdlktul,1578526837.0,"I hate that you and OP are being made to feel bad for not knowing everything (and honestly, no one knows EVERYTHING). I think it’s really unfair when experienced med techs don’t want to help the new ones. Our field is struggling as it is without people like that driving new grads away. Just know that not everyone in the field is like that. Hopefully you’ll get jobs where your trainers/supervisors have more patience."
medlabprofessionals,fdisa2k,t3_elkfpl,1578449911.0,I went through the UTMB program and passed the exam on the first try. It was reasonably priced and has a good passing rate. Definitely do your research to find one that fits you best. Good luck!
AskReddit,fdfp7jd,t1_fdf4vpy,1578366909.0,Same!
AskReddit,fcz3ai9,t1_fcxt8rq,1578092796.0,Happened to my dad. I think the actual words were “oh shit!” Thankfully it was fixable.
MadeMeSmile,fcz2wxa,t1_fcy700j,1578092578.0,UNITED!!!!
AskReddit,fcqoacp,t3_eifsmg,1577889481.0,Flushing a toilet. I guess I thought I was going to get sucked in.
todayilearned,fcov0s2,t1_fcosywz,1577842323.0,Fellow Hattiesburger here! Never heard of this. It’s always been MLK Day.
BostonTerrier,fcota4q,t3_ei9pg3,1577840949.0,I love it when my BT gets his lips stuck like that. We call it his muppet face.
AskReddit,fcj1i5k,t1_fcipzyz,1577674938.0,Yes quitting will help but it’s not instantaneous. It takes a couple of weeks to go away. I hope your friend gets better soon.
AskReddit,fcia6gj,t1_fcgy54o,1577659643.0,"When this question is posted, I always have to scroll down too far to find this response. It needs to be known because it’s becoming more prevalent. My sister suffers from this but won’t stop smoking. She’s been hospitalized a few times too."
todayilearned,fbxm5ie,t1_fbxbmuk,1577193556.0,Fellow blood banker here and I couldn’t agree more!
