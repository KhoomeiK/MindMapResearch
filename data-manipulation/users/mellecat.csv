The salve is $50...I was hesitating because that’s kind of expensive, but you don’t need much. I was surprised how effective it is.  Cbdistillerys products seem to offer the most bang for your buck
I just “leveled up “ so to speak, to the 2500 mg oil. That was $130 which is much cheaper than others I’ve seen.
