Always take spent oil to Pep Boys or Auto Zone to dispose of it properly.  If the RAV has more than 100K miles on it, definitely use premium synthetic oil and filters, I recommend Mobil 1. Premium oil costs more, but you can go a lot longer on one oil change--10K miles vs 3K miles with regular oil. That'll save you money in the long run.   

Regarding phone mounts, I bought this one, and it works great, you just have to very carefully follow the instructions (pick a smooth, not textured, surface to attach it to, and wait at least 24 hours for the glue to dry):

Whatcouldgowrong,fei5ztc,t1_fehy1sm,1579131039.0,"Oh totally. And there are way more bad dog owners than good ones. 

Dog ownership requires patience and responsibility.   And personally, I think you have to adopt one when they are puppies in order to train them properly with positive reinforcement. Or adopt one that is elderly and not much of a threat. Most people don’t do this, they’ll get a pit bull from the pound, and expect it to be fully trained. That’s incredibly dangerous, because you don’t know what the previous owner did to the dog, and dogs over a year old are difficult to train. 

I don’t own a dog now because I live alone in a 1 bedroom condo. That’s not enough space for a dog, it would spend 9 hours a day alone, which is unfair to the dog, and I prefer medium-to-large sized dogs, again, unfair to the dog. They need room. 

So I have been cat-only for over a decade, which is much easier. And even that is expensive—if I take 2 weeks vacation (I like to travel), it’s $32/day for high quality cat care (I use a service that employs veterinary technicians only). So any extended vacation I take costs me over $400 in cat care alone. I can only imagine 3 dog walks a day would cost me much more. 

All of that said, the girl in the picture was probably not picking up on the dog’s signals that it was about to bite. Especially a German Shepherd. They are a notoriously difficult breed, and I would never own one. Or a pit bull, for that matter. Mutts are actually the best, IMO.

On edit: in the top left picture, the dog’s ears are back. That is a sign that it is threatened, and is about to bite. That girl doesn’t realize this, otherwise she would have backed off."
