LosAngeles,ffp8j57,t1_ffnrx2e,1580088876.0,My girlfriend accidentally texted her landlord about it which must've been strange to receive.
news,ffnzsvr,t1_ffnmqo5,1580072749.0,"Pretty sure driving or even walking across the street might be more dangerous. But there's also significantly less helicopters than cars, although more wealthy/famous people are in helicopters so when it does happen we hear about it more. Just things that might away our perception one way or the other."

nba,ffkm6gk,t1_ffjunf7,1580025053.0,"I feel like since she's a stripper and her face isn't in it, she probs won't give a fuck."
gaming,ffk69nm,t1_ffk5goz,1580017250.0,I actually haven't played that yet. Now I guess I'll have to.
gaming,ffk3mst,t1_ffk2049,1580014790.0,"Exactly, the guy was talking about going from stealth archery and then 0 - 60 spawning a bunch of dragons in a town. Didn't sound like they found their happy medium or even looked for it."
gaming,ffk0fmp,t1_ffjqb64,1580012016.0,I'm just realizing I named one of my characters that a while back.
gaming,ffk0cs9,t1_ffjv8hz,1580011952.0,"Click the ""more replies"", I think that's where the arguments are going down."
gaming,ffk03ku,t1_ffjpvr9,1580011739.0,"Some of them are people with legit gripes about it. But yeah, some of them are gamers who have this idea of what a game should objectively accomplish. And others probably just want to shit on something popular that is loved by many, similar to the way I shit on top 40 pop songs on the radio."
gaming,ffjzw93,t1_ffjwb6w,1580011569.0,"I think they're saying that Skyrim is more like a series of books/movies that you get to write yourself. Or maybe that it's not like that at all, it's unscripted, more existential and immersive."
gaming,ffjzl5p,t1_ffjvs2p,1580011315.0,"I felt weird for not liking the Witcher because I really wanted to like it. I don't know why, but I just couldn't get into it. And I don't think it's about the deeper complexity, it just didn't feel right to me."
gaming,ffjzfao,t1_ffjoviv,1580011189.0,"I think there's a happy medium here. A complete Hello Kitty overhaul mod is whack, but alternative graphics and combat, inventory, etc those will do some good."

buildapc,ffj4kkh,t1_ffj4ao4,1579990230.0,"At least it's pretty, maybe they dig that. My current rig has been mistaken for a space heater twice now, I could always lie and say it is. Stealth gaming rig ftw."
funny,ffj4ea2,t1_ffi3dme,1579990102.0,Happens with Instagram all the time. Occasionally three accounts I follow will post the same shit after another one does in the same day.
buildapc,ffj40xw,t1_ffh0qgc,1579989832.0,My ex hated the lights on my keyboard and mouse lol. Sometimes I'd find several things unplugged in frustration... Idk why she didn't just unplug the surge protector.

warriors,ffj230c,t1_ffip0yz,1579988447.0,Even if he goes somewhere else he should come back and do his final year in GS.
baseball,ffh5as6,t1_ffh13ei,1579923512.0,Exactly. Even bringing it up and mentioning that it was wrong is the most we've had so far.

skiing,fffmipp,t1_ffeub9j,1579887161.0,Definitely influenced my ski style growing up. Although I don't have that same fearlessness when I was younger which is probably a good thing.
gaming,fffhtmz,t1_fffhq2t,1579884274.0,We played ourselves.
gaming,fffhk6p,t1_fffh4mh,1579884111.0,"One time I did this and I swear I made it more lethal than it was contagious and it killed everyone who was infected beforehand, but it couldn't spread fast enough."

ShouldIbuythisgame,fffey8h,t1_fffabxh,1579882491.0,"Assetto Corsa was really challenging for me, guess it was too realistic. Might give it another try, because I wanted to like it. I've honestly felt like I've been chasing the nostalgia of the old NFS Underground. Might give Forza a go though if that;s a bit more sophisticated."
