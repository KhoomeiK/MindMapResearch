YouShouldKnow,feceyc1,t1_fece6dn,1578972309.0,"So very true. We just never know. 

This client is actually one of the best employers I’ve ever met. They’re electrical workers and the owner can still work the field at 80 years old (Don’t ever show doubt because he’s serious and I believe him). Such good people. They actually check in with the girlfriend and son. They gave additional financial help with son’s tuition, son’s housing, and girlfriend’s housing. That kid and lady have more help and love than they can ever hope for and they both appreciate it so much. 

They made it part of their promise (in writing) to employees to help and assist their family. As electrical workers I’m sure you can imagine the relief and positive impact. They very rarely have turnover. 

But honestly this is such a rare situation. 

I’ve had employers fight to NOT give the life insurance because they were planning on firing or they were getting written up or blah blah blah bullshit. 

I’m a benefits broker. I do not fucking care about HR politics. We do what is correct under laws regardless of the wants of the employer. 

Most employers do truly want to do the right thing. The ones that don’t aren’t my client."
YouShouldKnow,fecdt5j,t1_feccd5a,1578971539.0,"Exactly! For example: I have a client whose employee went to work like normal on Friday, was in a coma Saturday, and dead Sunday. He had undiagnosed tongue cancer that spread to lung cancer and killed him without him ever knowing. 

He had an 18 year old son and a girlfriend of 15 years who lived with him. His estranged wife (son’s mother who left them 17 years prior) would have got 100% of his life insurance (employer provided basic life insurance for no cost to their employees). 

The state of Texas by law leaves the spouse the primary beneficiary. He was never legally divorced. 

He properly designated his girlfriend as the beneficiary on all of his paperwork. His girlfriend actually got the life insurance because he filled out the right paperwork and that’s what the carrier goes by unless proven otherwise. 

His estranged wife has a case, but she’ll have to fight for it. Apparently she is trying, but it’s a fight with the insurance carrier and not with the girlfriend and son luckily. 

It’s a shame actually because he tripled his life insurance a few days prior. It would have gone into effect on 8/1 but he died 7/31. We tried, but honestly we couldn’t do anything and I still feel bad about it."
YouShouldKnow,fec8dyk,t1_fec67ay,1578968441.0,"So we have 3 dogs that are 9 years old. We understand if a situation happens that leaves us gone and them alive it’ll be rough. These dogs average 12 years so I really was just focused on keeping them at ease if possible. 

I actually outline that I want them to stay together and if they can do that they get $30,000 of the life insurance. If they can’t, then the brother and sister HAVE to stay together and whoever takes them gets $20,000 and who takes the other one (the best one actually) gets $10,000. Our family and friends all joke about taking the third one so I actually kind of incentivized them staying together to avoid it. 

We have good friends who would take them without question, but honestly it’d be a war with my family and I don’t want my dogs to deal with that at all."
YouShouldKnow,fec3x9k,t3_eob76n,1578966290.0,"YES! This! I am 28 and have had a will, including a living will, in place since I was 25. I outline everything and I know it will help my family avoid fights with each other.

\-Exactly what I want to be buried with and what I don't want to be buried with (my family, mostly an aunt, likes to add weird shit to the casket, for example she wanted to stuff a pillow in my grandpa's casket because ""he liked it""). By outlining my wishes in my will I actually help my family avoid fights with each other. 

\-I state in my will and living will that my family has to listen to my husband's wishes and his decisions are final. It actually calms me knowing he won't have to deal with any of their suggestions because my will actually states he doesn't have to and they have to just listen to his. 

\-I outline that if my pets survived and both my husband and I die together and my wishes for their care.

\-Jewelry and family heirlooms very clearing stated who gets what.

\-I have more than enough in life insurance (beneficiaries all clearly stated) to pay off the cars and house and outline where all would go to avoid all family bickering.

\-I actually have a grave plot paid for already (I'm catholic and my family is all in the same cemetery). 

My husband calls me morbid AF, but hey I'm an insurance broker and I see this shit day after day for those who did not plan ahead. I do not want anyone to have to deal with anything or anyone questioning or benefiting by being sneaky.

Also, the will prep was free through my benefits so why the fuck not?"
Dallas,fdlxqmh,t3_elrufa,1578535013.0,Shocker.
HealthInsurance,fdlq6aq,t1_fdlplxq,1578529857.0,ACA guidelines (if the plan is fully insured) limits notification to 31 days. 60 days would require the carrier to approve it. HR can request approval! Not guaranteed but worth a shot!
HealthInsurance,fdlo23z,t3_em0y7k,1578528416.0,"Actually moving back into the US from out of the country can be a Qualified Life Event, which can allow enrollment onto the plan. Also, most plans renew on January 1st, and you are still within the open enrollment window per ACA guidelines to make changes up to 30 days after the effective date. They need to contact their HR and ask what their options are. I'm a license employee benefits broker in Texas."
MachineGunKelly,fcw5yg6,t1_fcvi9mn,1578017918.0,Was at that show. Have to agree. Flak can be shared I guess?
meirl,fcvm00p,t1_fcvli3g,1578004975.0,Haha she definitely is! They’re so worth it :). I wish you the best! My vet did recommend a few other prescriptions to see what worked. I know we had her on another Royal Canin prescription food at the same time just to make sure her hormones and everything were healthy levels. Tantrums were thrown until we figured it out!
meirl,fcvij8p,t1_fcvh6pl,1578002823.0,"Sounds just like mine! My mom thinks my dog only listens to her for tricks, but it’s because that dog will do anything for food! Effie, my dog, has literally just tipped over food bowls that weren’t filled all the way or had other kinds of off-the-shelf diet dog food. It’s impressive how hateful she gets. 

I have my dogs each on a vet wellness plan through Banfield. The vet prescribed Royal Canin Satiety Support. You need a prescription to buy it at petsmart or in a Banfield office. She loves that food and since it just makes her feel full she still eats what she should and then she’s just a happy 9 year old puppy!"
meirl,fcvg8o7,t1_fcvfz3k,1578001450.0,"I have one like that! My girl will clear every bowl she could get. She’s actually on prescription dog food to make her feel full. She’s lost about 30 lbs that she needed to. She would legit be pissed off when I restricted food and she can be destructive when she wants to. My dogs can get things off the top of the fridge so she always managed to find something. She still is a ham, but the prescription food has been a life saver!"
