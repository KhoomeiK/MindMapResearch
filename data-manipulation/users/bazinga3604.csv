DCInterns,ff86ibe,t1_ff85u7a,1579667368.0,"Haha, I did almost the exact same thing. I did a district House internship my junior year, had a job in Alaska the summer before my senior year, interned the fall of my senior year, returned to school for my last semester, and came back to DC in September following my graduation in May. It worked out for me. I wouldn’t change a thing.

If you’re going to do fall, I’d make sure to build connections with the people you work with. Gain trust and make them remember you. Do your job well and do it with a good attitude - even things like organizing the supply closet or logging constituent calls. Then when you’re looking for a full time job (or paid internship until you find a full time job) they’ll want to help you. Jobs in DC are widely filled by word of mouth. Knowing the right person at the right time can be your foot in the door. They help you finding jobs on the Hill, in think tanks and even possibly political appointee jobs in the administration (depending on your party affiliation and who is in the White House).

That having been said, none of that applies for a federal career job. No idea how the mythical shitshow of USAJobs.gov does it’s thing. It’s its own beast."
DCInterns,ff85lj9,t1_ff853cj,1579666624.0,"To be honest all of my experience in government had been on the Hill, so I can’t speak with personal experience about how a legislative internship will impact your chances of getting an executive internship, but I honestly don’t think it will hurt you. A lot of people in DC have some sort of partisan experience on their resume. It might be a good way to get you out to DC where you can apply for jobs you’re wanting to find long term. 

There will definitely be a lot of political appointment jobs available in the executive branch in the next year, especially if there’s a change of president. So that’s something worth keeping in mind. Not sure what your timing looks like for coming out to DC, but this time next year could have a lot of opportunities available both on the Hill and in the administration following the elections."
DCInterns,ff7u7ny,t3_es49ub,1579658473.0,"I’m an internship coordinator and have had this position in 3 different Senate offices. District internships are typically harder to fill - students usually want to come out to DC. It could be a red flag that they don’t have a spring intern currently, but it’s just as likely that no one applied. If I were you I’d go for it and use your experience/network that you build there to pivot into a DC internship or job down the road. 

Let me know if you have questions. I love being an intern coordinator and working with students!"

DCInterns,femnll0,t3_ept1rx,1579263824.0,"Definitely start looking as soon as you secure an internship, especially for summer. 

The colleges in the area open their dorms for interns to rent during the summer - I believe I’ve had interns stay at GW, Georgetown and American (with GW being the most conveniently located to the Hill). 

If you’re a woman, check out Thompson Markward Hall. You can rent a room anywhere from two weeks to two years and it’s literally right across the street from the Hart Building.  The rules about no men/no alcohol on the premed is can be irritating for some, but if you can tolerate it for a few weeks it’s a pretty good deal. 

Washington Intern Student Housing (WISH) is also a company I’ve had a lot of students use. 

All of these are likely easier/more reliable than trying to find a sublease. You know you’re working with an established, reputable company, and that you’re not about to get scammed. Summer in DC is the busiest time for internships, so I’d definitely recommend doing the research now and locking in your choice of housing when you get your offer (assuming you haven’t already - but if you already have accepted an offer go ahead and lock your housing down now.)"

Regardless, I’m sure budget cuts were likely part of the root issue. Maybe a new policy was established regarding number of Constitutions given per group? I just don’t see why a member would limit something like this just to be spiteful or difficult. There’s something more too it."
MaliciousCompliance,fdydkhf,t3_en74zi,1578778627.0,"Senate staffer here. Pocket Constitutions used to be given out with every new printing by the Government Printing Office (GPO). This happened once a congress, so every two years the allocation renewed. Member offices had so many of them that they really couldn’t get rid of them fast enough. Staffers would hand them out at every function possible, and would give unlimited numbers to any teacher/school/civic group that would request them. Then the sequester hit and budget cuts eliminated the regular printings. So each office had an allocation of something like 2000 Pocket Constitutions to give out until there was a reprint. When that would happen? No one could predict. When your allocation was depleted you didn’t get more. And the extra shitty part was that member offices were prohibited from 1) purchasing more with official funds and 2) getting something similar printed at our in-house Printing and Graphics Office because P/G is legally prohibited from printing anything similar to items released by GPO. Icing on the cake is that if you were a newly elected member of Congress, you inherited your predecessors allocation. So if they had none left, you had none left. This whole cycle basically meant that schools who had regularly received hundreds of Pocket Constitutions with no issue were now throttled, because as a senator representing millions of people, I have 2000 Pocket Constitutions to give to everyone for the foreseeable future.

I think what your school did is fine. Anyone who is determined enough to wrangle 80 students into writing letters to their members of Congress truly wants them and will put them to use. It’s also teaching students how to reach out to Congress, and that responses can be received if you are willing to try, both great lessons. I like this, but I wanted to give some reason for the policy change."

Also, my mom has been calling my baby “our baby” and it’s such a small thing but it’s driving me crazy. I gently corrected her on Christmas. Hopefully it stops.

Edit: just got off the phone with my mom. She said it again. I corrected it. We went back and forth a few times and she finally said it was mine. My mom and I generally have a great relationship.

Oh! Another fun Capitol fact - in addition to the Senate office buildings where Senators have their official offices, every senator also has a secret room in the Capitol where they can take meetings/catch up on paperwork/hide from staff. They’re unofficially called hideaways, and they’re unmarked rooms throughout the Capitol that come in especially handy during back to back vote series."
