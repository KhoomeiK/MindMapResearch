Last I checked ""not innovating for the state"" wasn't a crime in the US"
AskReddit,ffvigqy,t1_ffvf5rv,1580264883.0,"> Oh, I'm sorry, is militarization of space only good when the US does it? I must have missed that memo. 

And how many Soviet lives did it cost vs American lives? How many soviets in the space program ended up dead or in the gulag vs Americans?

Yes. Surely the threat of death and work camps and the loss of life due to haste for a small set of achievements  from a country with vast resource is the pinnacle of innovation.

No. Hundreds of millions of innovations from free people whose life improved by every scientifically accepted metric during the same time period under capitalism was surely inferior.

But hey, since every economic system made by flawed humans has flaws, we will throw out the system that has empirically brought more prosperity and wealth to human kind  because it isn't perfect and trade it for a system which has never even come close in any measurable way with the hope that it *might* end up as some perfect utopia.

Yup. Sounds like a sound plan to me."

AskReddit,ffvd39p,t1_ffvb1n8,1580261281.0,"> Or did we conveniently forget the huge advancements the Soviets made? 

Literally the only advancements the Soviets can claim have to do with nuclear weapons and delivering nuclear warheads (space program)

Are we saying that advancements in nuclear warfare were a *good* thing?

Other than that, there wasn't much technological advancement the soviets can claim.

AskReddit,ffvclzg,t1_ffurxiw,1580260959.0,"Bill Gates literally gives away *Billions* of dollars every year. He gives over a billion to fight malaria and it still hasn't been eradicated.  He has committed to giving away his  entire fortune. If the world's second richest person hasn't been able to solve these problems, what makes you think your CEO is magically capable?

Are you willing to do your CEOs job? Are you willing to take risks or do you just want to work and get a reliable paycheck? How are you measuring ""underpaid""? If there are better employers willing to pay you a higher salary or the same for less hours, then why not take them up on it? Or are you just envious because you work hard and other people who also work hard make more than you?"

Climate science isn't something most people can easily distill to ELI5 level.  The people who can need to be the ones leading advocacy here. Addressing the skepticism is going to go way farther than ""Stupid Denier! The world is ending and you're part of the problem!!""

Not to mention the problem is so complex it's going take multiple experts from multiple disciplines to give us laypeople stupid simple and easy steps to help address the problem.

Virtually everything in modern life has a byproduct of CO2. These millions of complex systems have to be modified to address this concern by the millions of experts in those fields.

Not to mention most of the solutions that have been good candidates are political or PR suicide. E.g. See carbon taxes in France.

This is a solvable problem. However, it's not as simple as get the right politician elected and their magic  signing pen does the rest."
