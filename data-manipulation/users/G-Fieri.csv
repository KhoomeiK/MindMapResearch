mentalhealth,feo6e29,t1_fenl4rz,1579295769.0,"Not a problem, man.  Take care of yourself!"
mentalhealth,fenkztl,t1_fenct9i,1579286932.0,"They count.  Suicidal thoughts are taken very seriously.  You're not asking dumb questions, it takes guts to reach out to someone and it is the first step to improvement, so there's nothing to be sorry about.  Honestly, the doctors know more than me.  There's St. John's Wort, do some research first because I know it has some interactions with other things.  I've never actually tried it myself.

It will definitely be worth going to see the doctor to ask these questions.  They know a lot more than most people here can tell you and if they don't, they know who to ask.  Even though it may cost a bit in the US, it will be worth looking into and at least asking about it.  I do not know how Medicaid works either.  I really hope you ask a doctor, they can be a great help."
mentalhealth,fen7u2b,t1_fen6ooo,1579278871.0,I think I know what you mean.  Take it one day at a time and don't hesitate to phone your doctor.  Just do what you can for now.
mentalhealth,fen7gq1,t1_fen5ysa,1579278641.0,"It really shouldn't be expensive.  I didn't even have to go through a doctor while I was in the States.  That being said, they could probably recommend one.  I was given options at the place I went to and one of the team was a student and I'm pretty sure it was under $100 a month.  Keep in mind that this wasn't someone who could write prescriptions for meds, she was a local therapist/counsellor.

 If you think you need medication then you would definitely have to go through your doctor to see a psychiatrist.  You don't have to see the psychiatrist very often, they are often not who you go and do sessions with.  They will be the ones you discuss medications with."
mentalhealth,fen2qpn,t3_eq1ol1,1579275671.0,"I'm not a doctor, but I have depression.  It's not constant sadness.  There are symptoms online that you can look up, but I do believe it's quite normal to have those feelings every now and again.  

Things to look out for are potential stressors in your life and if there's a change in how frequently you have those thoughts and/or how intense they are.  You might not be actively thinking about stressors at the time, but there could be underlying causes physiologically and/or psychologically.  Keep it in mind, and if it begins to affect your daily life do not be afraid to look for a therapist.  They can work wonders if you are open."

college,fefxld9,t1_fee5ivl,1579068569.0,This is pretty cool to know.  Thanks!
college,fefwthf,t1_fee5aju,1579067793.0,"Thanks, this helps.  I am taking chemistry/physics and hesitate on problems because I feel like there is a gap in my understanding even though I know how to do the problem.  I get frustrated and then just don't study lol"
MonsterHunterWorld,fee8f7b,t1_fee0ast,1579028533.0,I would also like to know
college,fee5gn1,t1_fee543y,1579026791.0,I'm currently studying chemistry/physics and last year I didn't have to study.  I skipped a year and my performance has certainly dropped.  I often feel like I have no idea where to start and when I solve problems correctly I still do not feel like I understand it in depth.  Have you felt the same way?
college,fee3664,t1_fee1ipi,1579025436.0,Physics is one of the subjects that I struggle to highlight important information to focus on.  Lately I just try to know what an equation is used for but I feel like a massive dumbass sometimes lol

I think I've noticed this because I was working last year and the next semester, after quitting my job, everything has gone a bit downhill lol.  What kind of work are you doing?  I hate not being busy at work, it's a different kind of exhaustion."
college,fedsyhr,t1_fedo0tv,1579019226.0,"I, a fellow human, also find it difficult to classify ""good study habits"" and distribute them across multiple different subjects.  Beep boop."
college,fedsfwr,t1_feds73w,1579018909.0,Holy shit.  I aspire to be as consistent as this.  Do you feel like having 2 jobs actually forces you to manage your time better?
college,feds8hl,t1_fedqc39,1579018781.0,"Well you're not alone lol, I think my study habits could be better.  If I had to guess, I'd say you are a caterpillar."
college,fedrx8w,t1_fedp5bt,1579018589.0,That's a good idea.  I have a whiteboard and should probably put the new equations we're introduced to weekly.
college,fedrqtz,t1_fednusk,1579018477.0,"My *ideal* study method, that I by no means follow, is separating the subject matter into pieces and then prioritising them.  For example, in precalc we went over 4 booklets worth of stuff.  Including algebra, exponent rules, differentiation and integration.  I am about to write the names of those 4 subjects on a piece of paper.

I'm then, hopefully, going to list the subheadings from each booklet under its corresponding subject.  Once that's done I would probably skim read the content in the booklet under each subheading and put a star next to the subheadings on my piece of paper that I should focus on.  Then I will do the practice assessment that is online.

I will then forget everything apart from my name when I'm given the assessment tomorrow."
college,fedqveq,t1_fednc22,1579017933.0,True.  I tend to cram everything and then forget about it lol
college,fedndze,t1_fedn00w,1579015732.0,"I have my first precalc exam tomorrow and I have not studied at all lmao but I'm feeling confident about it.  Other subjects I'm taking though, it can be difficult choosing what to study and how long to study it for.  Also, woof?"
college,fedn7fm,t1_fedmckb,1579015613.0,How do you split your time while studying?  Do you allocate a period of time for each major subject area?
