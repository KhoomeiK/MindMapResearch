MurderedByWords,fdp2wbi,t1_fdnu3f1,1578618711.0,"Ok so most people have sexual feeling before they’re 18. Women usually start menstruation before 18. For women, their sexual health and how they are treated sexually starts with their own understanding of themselves and their needs. So while their sexual health is left out of textbooks, the average 12 year old usually finds out about their own sexual health before 18 when society wants to consider them an adult. 

So while women are educating themselves about their sexual health, well before 18, they’re also understanding their own needs.
We moved past the days of  [“I drink Mountain Dew, so that means you can’t get pregnant.”](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/43ggk3/mountain-dew-sperm-count-rumor) or [“I smoke too much weed to get you pregnant.”](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180122150813.htm) Both lines were ones that were constantly told teenagers in my generation, bullshit lies that 15 year olds would tell to each other so they could have sex without “risk”. 

So while they end up teaching themselves via the internet over their bodies because most schools do not have sexual education, they learn what they want for themselves. The truth is that a lot of women probably have grown to want sex on their terms or focus on their own independence. There’s more of a call for women to know themselves before they enter a relationship rather than find someone right outside of high school and marry. Some women even go to college now, not to find a husband, but to actually peruse a career."
MurderedByWords,fdn5k4n,t1_fdn1pce,1578577893.0,"I say it has more to do with women being able to educate themselves whether or not public schools systems agree. The fact that there are cameras, dna tests, and social media has helped women be more aware or situations and their rights. They’re able to have sex now on their own terms, not need to to solidify a relationship or marriage. Also many child marriage laws have been ending state to state, in just recent years. It really should’ve been illegal for teen girls to be married off with their parent’s permission in the United States and it shouldn’t take until the the 2000’s for it to be illegal. How would a teenage girl be allowed to divorce in the situation once she turns 18, especially if she has children by family that forced her? The fact that women don’t usually come with a dowry or aren’t forced to born just to be caretakers is a big factor."

They can voice how they feel or voice they hope you feel a certain way but that’s your decision. If someone is asking for help that’s not them trying to guilt you. It’s asking for help. You feel guilty because you don’t want to give support when they’re asking for help. That’s also your choice because you’re not defining the relationship and what you can offer as support or even if you want to give it. There’s always an option to leave but if you stay then you can’t blame a person for asking for help from a person they assume loves them. That’s equally as toxic to have one foot in and one foot out of the relationship when you should be leaving."

When I went to the priest and told him, he nodded and understood then kept talking to the other parishioners. Then he comes back up to me and asks “what do you think we should do about the situation?” I think I might have said “umm take control of the situation.” I was so taken back that he had no idea what to do.

AskReddit,fde134o,t1_fddp6k7,1578328790.0,"If they want to avoid contact they have the right to. You can’t force social interaction or for people to like you. Also, it depends on the group you want to fit in with, maybe they’re not the type you should want to bend over backwards trying to impress and you want to seem interesting to. It’s a mix of knowing your audience and being comfortable being yourself with  context. Do you want to fit in with a group of asshole that intentionally isolates or perhaps a group of nice people that’s welcoming and accepting of different people? If all your friends are from the same walks of life, have the same stories, have the same prospective, things get dull. Some people like hearing the same things over and over again because they don’t expand their social circle. You should actually try to befriend people that are different than you so everyone can develop, not just the person that wants friends. Otherwise they should be pursuing interests that are more introverted and not relying on other people’s validation."

AskReddit,fddyvro,t1_fddqyhm,1578327314.0,"Well if you think they’re boring that’s different than them thinking themselves as boring. Labeling someone as boring means you want to avoid them because you don’t like them or want to tolerate being around them. Your friend looking up something to suggest the think of themselves as boring, suggests they just don’t know what they’re good at or want to better themselves, plus they feel judged by people around them. It’s possible that they might not need to improve themselves, just find better company. If you think their interests are not captivating, that’s your issue. That’s what I meant by “projecting”. It’s like the saying “not my cup of tea”. People still find other tea to drink if they like tea, just not that blend.

What you can do is find common interests to talk about and try to steer the conversation in a direction where they feel better, not worse through interacting with you. Maybe they feel uncomfortable through conversations, but if you really want to help them, try to have them feel relaxed. Otherwise let them find other people to interact with so they don’t feel pressure to make other people feel comfortable. They probably feel like they have to perform to be your friend and perhaps they need to know they’re fine just being themselves, because that’s the truth.  It’s hard to inspire when you feel judged and low about yourself. It hurts finding out your friends tolerate your presence and aren’t really supportive or accepting. 

If your friend has people tell them their boring, tell them to look elsewhere and talk to people that they have common interests with. The problem is they’re hanging out with people that are rude and will say that they are boring without trying to improve the conversation themselves just assign blame. It’s like a coach for a losing team blaming the players when he refuses to lead. If they’re bored through the interaction, they’re easily to blame as well."

The fact that we could plan anything to say goodby felt like a gift in the situation, because the other times I lost pets it was sudden or it time to accept what was happening. 

We also made a very big toy donation to the local animal shelter after she passed and donated her unused medications back as well in her name. I believe we might have planned to do that as we were coming home from the vet to have a positive end to the same day: 

As far as myself handling, it’s not easy because it took me a while to realize I was crying for myself and not for her. She wasn’t in pain anymore, we provided her with a great life, it’s just I was missing my friend. Staying busy helps, watching funny movies helps, I remember my friend came over with the LEGO movie and it was perfect. I remember I got a fake fur blanket to cuddle with and it helped to snuggle with that while I cried. Then when we were ready we considered foster/adopting again but mostly in honor of the dog that passed. She was a senior dog that was abused in a puppy mill and it just felt more fitting to open our home again to an older dog that was in that situation and needed it.

vaporents,fdcz23x,t3_ekpbps,1578288605.0,"Mighty is bigger but the battery lasts a lot longer.  I’ve had two Mighty’s and I kinda think besides the bulk it’s the device the go. It’s solid, effective consistent hits. You will not be disappointed but it’s a touch too big for it to be “portable” in my opinion. Have I snuck it in a bag anyway and carried it despite the size? You betcha, because it hits well enough to justify bringing it. Plus the charge lasts at least a day and can be used while plugged into the wall. It’s essential a portable desktop vape. 

Crafty you maybe get 3 or 4 sessions for the charge. The power button broke on my Crafty when I first bought it. It was weird, I pressed it in, it just went flat and dead. It was 3 days after it arrived for a 420 online sale. This was when the app could turn on the device and I was able to use it that way for a while. I had it replace and then the adapter  kinda somewhat broke it but I lent it out to a friend that hardly ever uses. This person maybe uses MJ for pain twice a month so the Crafty seemed like a good option to help this friend out and it was very functional still despite what was going on with it. The constant charging was just getting aggravating to me. 

Even though I was having issues with the Crafty, compared to the Mighty it’s just not as solid and it feels, for lack of a better word, inferior (?). I never had the button issues with the Mighty and it just physically feels different in comparison. Also, keep aware of the warranty and save the receipts, Storz & Bickel is wonderful with replacing everything but there is a time period, I think 2 years if it hasn’t changed.

Some people have said that it’s fully extracted in a couple minutes of shaking and there are some that leave it in the freezer for months. The important part of the extraction process is that it needs to be cold from the freezer, not room temperature. Personally I think it’s fully extracted in few minutes. Also, if you used a vaporizer that needs parts cleaned like a screen or mouthpiece (mighty, crafty, etc) you can clean them the same way. Place everything in a jar of Everclear and make a little mini extraction.  If you want to look further into it, this type of tincture is usually called “golden dragon” and a tincture that is made without avb is usually called “green dragon”. 

A lot of people like water curing their avb, but personally I don’t. With this extraction I put them in glass spray bottles with a few drops of mint essential oils (make sure it’s one that can be ingested) and it becomes a breath spray to use with micro-dosing .

If you can do anything to reduce the smell, not be decked out in 420 stuff and suggest a reason to be suspicious, that might give you a chance. Also the cardinal rule: don’t break two laws at once if you’re testing fate. Personally, I don’t think keeping the card with your driver’s license is a good idea and I would only present mine if they asked. [In fact usually the best piece of advice I could give is the less Info you say the better]( https://youtu.be/JcZoCY7fUXg) and make sure you ask “am I being detained or am I free to go”. I know some people that have the law printed out in their car and carry it with them in case they get pulled over by a cop that doesn’t know. All it takes is it to be their word against yours in this situation unfortunately."
NewJerseyMarijuana,fcxponk,t3_ejgejb,1578068535.0,"Ok so I have two stories. Not me but former friend so I don’t give a shit if her stories are public now. Ha ha. 

Background to read or skip: this former (family life-long) friend is a daughter of a former mayor, in a republican town and she is a special needs teacher. It would be a big deal for her to get busted with drugs. She got sent to rehab once as a teenager and that started her on coke because that’s where she met her connections. So her husband died and suddenly her Nazi ex boyfriend decided to look her up and work back into her life. After a year, she was ready to throw him out of the house and he was saying he would call the police on all of us and take away her kids. So I was the only one that took his threats seriously and I got my card cut ties with her as my source. About a month after I got my card, (4 months after he threatened us) she said CPS and the police came, he was claiming squatters rights in her home. He also destroyed the room she was letting him stay in with spray painted swastikas all over the room. So she was able to get a order of protection he had to leave the state. (A few months after all this he died from gunshot wounds to the head. That was my main problem with him being in my friend’s house with her kids, because I assumed this was going to be a murder suicide situation at some point. It’s still up in the air if the opioid drug dealers he flipped on did it, the girlfriend he cheated on did it, or if it was self inflicted but all of them were in the room when he was shot.) They found nothing at my former friends house but she of course tested dirty for THC and the only option were:  get the medical card, or go to rehab for a month so she didn’t loose custody of her kids. So I gave her all the info for my doctors because I had PTSD and I kinda thought she had it too after all this shit. (She actually was seeing a therapist for it when her husband died, and was diagnosed for PTSD then, but that doctor wanted her to “set a good example for her kids, go to rehab and be the responsible person who uses her Xanax prescription instead”). So she got her card very quickly thanks to me doing the research to find the right doctors. She got to keep her kids and have distance from the psychopath she was involved with until he died.

First time she got pulled over:

She was in her town, finishing up a joint in the grocery store parking lot as she drove past the cop. She immediately got pulled over because of the smell. He said “I caught a huge whiff of that as you drove past me”. She knew it too. She cried and told him she was just having a stressful day and finished up the last of her medication blah blah blah. He gives her a roadside sobriety test which she said was super easy, and let her go. No ticket just the warning not to do it again.

Second time she got pulled over:

She didn’t fully stop at the stop sign. Cop pulled her over right away and smell the joint that just she finished right away. She said that some smoke may have still been in the car. She went into her story on how she has her card and “just finishing up blah blah blah stressful mom” tears, easy sobriety test again and they let her leave because she had the card.

Now you think this person would have kept her script active and followed up with the appointments to get the card again, especially since it  her kids from being taken away so many times and saved her ass even when she was still insistent on breaking the rules of the card while smoking and driving? Nope. Apparently that was my responsibility to make all the appointments and shit for her. In her mind, I helped her get the card but probably only talk to her 3 times a year, when the doctor’s appointments needed to be made.

TLDR:someone I know got pulled over twice, they had to do roadside sobriety test twice but they said it was super easy and the cops said “well I have to let you go” both times."

NewJerseyMarijuana,fcx0zww,t1_fcwdjvz,1578046372.0,"Be careful how you use the water adapter on the crafty. I could feel it pushing the device each time until it basically pushed the join apart. I just think it has to do with where the curve is located on the adapter. Storz and Bickel replaced it, but I was lucky considering I purchased the adapter from the 3rd party (not going to name them but I assume it was the same place). 3rd party was “oh well go through the manufacture” not even an apology for the inconvenience nor a coupon code thrown my way even though that was the 2nd issue with the crafty with them. (First one, I purchased a crafty during a 420 special and after 3 days the power button wouldn’t turn it. This was when the app could turn on the device so that was how I was able to turn it on for a month before it got too annoying. Then this happened maybe a year later with the adapter and I had to send it back for another replacement.)  

This is just with the crafty btw, the mighty doesn’t have this issue with the adapter because the curve lines up at a different spot.

NewJerseyMarijuana,fcqns3x,t1_fcqg2et,1577889231.0,"Well that’s one is still on the grassroots side I guess. We started leaving cards for doctors in the program and also Uber and Lyft cards with them at the American Legion. Also we donated a lot cards to the veteran’s housing development that’s nearby with some information on the dispensaries. Personally, I get a little concerned with starting a charity and people taking a cut for themselves to “run” the charity and defeating the purpose. It’s a little frustrating being behind the scenes with a few organizations and see exactly how  opportunistic people can get with people in need. So the point of this was to just have simple conversations of support, show people care and there are other medication options."

My husband saw me in a neck brace struggling daily with pain just to do anything. So when I was able to get it again and it worked for the pain, I started worrying  it would stress our relationship. He was so excited I had a solution for the pain and thought I was being silly. 

If anything, he’s become a bigger advocate for the medical program without even using it. He’s usually stuck talking to people in the waiting room hearing their frustrations while I’m picking up my medicine. He went into local politics and spent 3 years writing the zoning guidelines from scratch for a medical dispensaries to be allowed into our town, after he heard people were driving 3 hours one way. Now other towns are using our zoning guidelines because they exist. He also started a program for people to donate Uber and Lyft gift cards for veterans to have a ride to the dispensaries. Definitely seeing him support the program and trying to find solutions for other people in need has strengthened our relationship."
