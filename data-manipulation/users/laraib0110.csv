kittens,fdoe6ll,t1_fdodcuk,1578603473.0,"She is actually a queen, i served her kibbles mixed in some wet food, as i am trying to get her used to dry food, she kept spitting them and ate all the wet food, then i realized she only eat kibbles mixed in wet food when they become soggy, queen has preferences. Also she wasnt drinking enough water, turned out she didnt like the bowl, though it was size appropriate, so i had to change the bowl, now she happily drinks water. And today i was eating a cream cheese puff,  she started licking my lips for cheese. She is adorable."
