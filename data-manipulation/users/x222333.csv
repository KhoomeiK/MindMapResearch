ToiletPaperUSA,fdp1npt,t1_fdoxa36,1578617871.0,"> The economy of California is the largest in the United States, boasting a $3.0 trillion gross state product as of 2018.[9] As a sovereign nation (2018), California would rank as the world's fifth largest economy, ahead of India and behind Germany.[10] Additionally, California's Silicon Valley is home to some of the world's most valuable technology companies, including Apple, Alphabet Inc., and Facebook.[11] In total, over 10% of Fortune 1000 companies were based in California in 2018, the most of any state.[12]

> As both the most populous US state[13] and one of the most climatologically diverse states, the economy of California is varied, with many sizable sectors. The most dominant of these sectors include finance, business services, government and manufacturing. Much of the economic activity is concentrated in the coastal cities, especially Los Angeles, which has a relative focus on media—most notably Hollywood—and the San Francisco Bay Area, which predominantly concentrates on technology. Both cities, along with other major ports such as San Diego, also act as significant trade hubs to and from the United States. Furthermore, California's Central Valley is one of the most productive agricultural regions on Earth, growing over half the country's fruits, vegetables, and nuts.[14]

Being biased is not the same as being untrustworthy.  Speaking of that:

>Overall, we rate Fox News strongly Right-Biased due to editorial positions and story selection that favors the right. We also rate them Mixed factually and borderline Questionable based on poor sourcing and the spreading of conspiracy theories that later must be retracted after being widely shared. Further, Fox News would be rated a Questionable source based on numerous failed fact checks by hosts and pundits, however straight news reporting is generally reliable, therefore we rate them Mixed for factual reporting.
