While these people declare all autistic people's experiences are different, they maintain that THEY are instantly experts in ALL autistic people, no matter the severity of the disorder, no matter how old they are. Lots of high-functioning autistics without any mental deficits, and without children, REALLY like to lecture neurotypical parents of severely disabled autistic kids on how they should be raising their kids.

Example: a lot of autistic kids wander outside on their own, which has led to horrible accidents and deaths. A lot of parents of autistic children have multiple locks on their door and warn neighbors to notify them if they see their kid out without an adult.

Reasonable precautions? No, you're interfering with your child's right to free movement - if they're trying to get out, obviously it's because you're abusing them! And telling neighbors is directly against their right to privacy!"

The minority students had their own troubles. The school made a big deal about a program especially for the minority students with waivers. They expected things like language issues, how to deal with job discrimination, or roommate problems or family/community support. 

The program apparently assumed they'd all grown up in a poor ghetto bubble cut off from the world and didn't know how anything worked. They got classes on social graces and VERY basic study skills.

Nearly all of these kids came from middle to upper class backgrounds. Many came from specialty science and math academies with rigorous curriculums. To say the least, they were rather offended that the school assumed because of their race, they couldn't possibly know this shit already.  

Talks on these subjects open to EVERYONE, regardless of race, sex, whatever, on our large state university campus might have been helpful. But they only gave them to the minority scholarship students.

I took the ACT to see if I could get a 31, high enough for a full tuition waiver, but after I got a 30 on the third try, I decided to leave it at that.

Shortly before I graduated high school, the college I was going to attend sent me a letter saying, essentially, ""We know you didn't score high enough on the ACT for the full tuition waiver, but we looked at all your other qualifications, and you're so overqualified, we're giving it to you, anyway."" 

I was ecstatic! I tried really hard, and they made an exception! Go me!

So a few months later, I start college...and run into several girls that had had the same thing happen - didn't score high enough, but were told they'd gotten the full waiver anyway. We also noticed all of the girls with the same story were white or Asian.

Someone did some looking around, and we found out what happened. While everyone had to make the same GPA for the waivers, the test scores needed to get the waivers were different according to sex and race. White and Asian guys had to make the highest scores, then white and Asian women could make a little less, then Hispanic men a little less, Hispanic women a little less, then black men a little less and black women a little less, finally, Native American men and women could have the lowest scores and still qualify for the waiver. 

The college hadn't gotten enough white and Asian girls scoring high enough on the ACT to get the full waiver, and it was more important, apparently, to have a requisite number of white and Asian girls getting that waiver, so they lowered the requirements for white/Asian girls.

All of us felt kind of sick when we learned that. We weren't special, like they tried to tell us we were - they had to fill a slot. I'm glad I got the full waiver, but dear God, I wish I'd have actually earned it than qualified because of my race and sex."

I wish they would crack down on those ""ESA registration services"". They fuck over people with legit service animals that are trained and doing a job, and those who have ESAs who got a letter from actual professionals who agreed the pet's part of their mental health recovery. 

On another note, when did people stop housetraining thieir dogs? There's all these people I've seen in public and known, as acquaitances, and their dogs are completely untrained inside and out. They stuff them in the grocery cart and pee and poop, owner going blithely on. At home, they just put down puppy pads and hope the dog decides to use them, some don't even do that. 

Most of them, they're the people who are with their dog 24/7, it's not like they're not there to take them out. The dogs usually aren't elderly or disabled in some way that makes them incontinent. Growing up, I can't think of anyone when I was growing up who just let their perfectly healthy dog crap all over the place.

You could get your learners' permit (can drive if there's someone licensed and 18 or older in the car)at 15 if you passed the eye exam and a multiple choice test. They waived the written test if you were in or had taken Driver's Ed. When you were 16, if you passed a driving test, you got your license.

Our school's Driver's Ed was a joke - books and simulators were all older than we were, the ""teachers"" were coaches first and only taught a class because they had to. 

Driving practice usually entailed being berated while driving a teacher to their house to pick up their lunch. We had to cut out a certain number of newspaper articles. Their attempt at showing us to change a tire ended in the car falling off the jack because the placed it wrong.

The highlight was the highway patrolman who brought the really gross car accident photos and helpfully pointed out blood splatter patterns and brain matter. 

Basically, I learned nothing. I got my permit right after I started the class, would occasionally drive my mom's wagon to the store with her, but I really didn't LEARN until I graduated high school and got a car. The summer before I started college, my parents taught me, and I passed the driving test by one point the day before I moved into the dorms.
