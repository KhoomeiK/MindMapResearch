I grew up with divorced parents and our quality of life suffered greatly because my single mother couldn't be made to understand how cooking food was cheaper than buying it already cooked. In America at least, what I've experienced, the poorest folks buy the most pre packaged, pre cooked, frozen, and fast foods. That costs them so so much more than buying chicken and beef every week. Food is incredibly cheap in the US, or incredibly expensive the choice is yours, and convenince costs. That $5 Pizza that ""You couldn't cook this for less than $5"" could be replaced by pounds of eggs, beans, and rice but the fool is completely convinced in his/her own mind."
