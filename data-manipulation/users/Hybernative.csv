CreepyWikipedia,ff15kiw,t1_ff0rgrm,1579475461.0,"There is no cure currently. We are but webplebs; Research Scientists and Medical Professionals have the penultimate word. When the numbers of lives saved and improved are crunched; gender reassignment surgery is the most effective treatment that Medicine currently has available. It's only performed *after* the patient has gone through ages of chemical treatment and counselling. Yes, surgery is imperfect; however we don't know enough about the human mind, that is as effective as the current treatment regimes (in developed countries). Things will surely improve in the future. But right now, in many heavily scrutinised cases, paid for by governments (ones that don't drop $1trillion dollars on Defense); surgery has the highest chance of giving the patient, a chance to live the life they would like to lead.

In the end, gender surgery is a drop in the bucket economically, and has success statistically. So that's the bread and butter of it."

This is great advice. My parents were Boomers, so I was always required to clear my plate and never waste food. Ironically, there is so much food available now, it is much healthier not to overeat, and to leave food on one's plate."

AmItheAsshole,fdm4c22,t3_eluqog,1578539482.0,"NTA. I take morphine and pregabalin (Lyrica) twice daily, and if a visitor went through my medical cupboard and stole all my meds, *I'd* be the one who was livid. Especially because it is a betrayal of trust, and difficult to get a replacement prescription. Your SIL should be pissed at her partner, not you both. 


Even if you *did* know about his addiction, he purposefully invaded your privacy by rummaging through your cupboard, and his theft from you is his own responsibility. He's not a child, and the meds were stored responsibly, in a safe place, out of sight. This man betrayed his partner, your trust in him, and anyone blaming you both, are literally blaming the victims of a crime. 


You have **no** ethical responsibility to destroy any legal, prescribed, and possibly still needed, analgesics. They were already secured in your locked house, and out of sight behind another door that only you two have any business going through.

You are not part of any problem; you didn't cause him to seek solace from life in an unhealthy way, by stealing and bingeing. Lack of the US government giving a shit about it's citizens and their mental healthcare, is the root of the problem. 


Your wife used **her** medication properly. You stored them properly. You could not have expected to have your trust and faith betrayed, and your wife's prescribed medication purposefully sought-out and stolen.


Your SIL and any family that have the gall to imply you were obligated to do anything with your wife's medication, and that you should have preemptively asked your SIL if her boyfriend was addicted to anything *just in case*, owe you both an apology.

Ironically, I think the fellow who stole your wife's meds in shame, and relapsed, would probably agree that neither you, nor your wife, is in the wrong here.

I hope he turns up safe and sound, and your family get some maturity and perspective. Recovering from addiction is an uphill struggle, but that is partly because one cannot expect everyone else they meet, and everywhere they go, to hide and lock all temptation up, whilst treating the sufferer of addiction as if they exist in a protective bubble."
