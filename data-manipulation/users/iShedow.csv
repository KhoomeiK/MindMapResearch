My next problem is getting just one record/order to show. I want to be able to search for just 1 customer, for their personal information and their order information and not have many other options show.

I've been doing this for a few years, meeting with succesful businessmen. They knew I was highly interested in business and sales so I would ask them about topics relating to their field.

This has paid off immensely. I have made so many new connections, I've had several nice job offers, and was able to get out of my hometown and get into a lucrative business field from all of this.

All it takes is 7-10 solid questions, 30 minutes, and roughly 10$ in coffee.

Always ask at the end if they would recommend anyone for you to meet.

selfimprovement,fdbw3c1,t1_fdbw2ac,1578262796.0,That was alot longer than i intended it to be...
selfimprovement,fdbw2ac,t1_fdbh8oi,1578262778.0,"In-tresting.. 

I seriously assumed you were an INFJ. Because I am one (I false type as an INTJ) so i know exactly what you're going through.

I will do my best down here to really help you out and how i deal with it.

* Honestly, people do dislike you. I dislike people for many reasons, so of them are very unwarranted. But, it doesnt do anything to them. It should never matter whether someone likes you or not. As long as they don't cause you harm. I could go on for a very long time about why peoples opinions truly don't matter (Takes time to get over this, be patient)
*  F\*\*\* friendships. People wont respect you if you are putting in all the work. What are those friendships proving you? You're 18 now, but in 3-4 years 95% of your friends will have moved on. You should move on. You'll find groups of friends that truly click with you and you wont have to try as hard.
* I love that you added that. In small groups i am very outgoing. But when it comes to large groups i am quiet as a mouse. I am an observer. I assume you are too. We are not made to socialize in large groups, it's not our style. You have to understand that. It's okay to be quiet and just observe. People love to talk, be the one that listens. People will laugh at you, but its not in a mean way. It's a cool trait to have and alot of people will silently respect you for that.
* You don't click because your personality style just doesnt mesh with them. Don't force it. It's a classic INFJ thing. Hang out with older more mature people, that's your style. Maybe embrace solitude (In a healthy way!) and in a few years you will settle down alot more.
* All round out the rest here, honestly i could go on for awhile. You're young, you are who you are. All those things you listed off are what i have had to deal with over the years. I used to have a big friend group, but i outgrew them. I love those guys, but it's just the way of life. I have kept my inner circle small and these friends all click with me. We are mainly aspiring entrepreneurs. Find what you're passionate about, it may take you awhile, then find people with the same. 

To end, You are a weirdo and people make fun of you. Embrace it, it means you are not following the status quo. You're special. Keep your circle small and relate-able. Honestly in a few years as you mature, you will learn to love all your little quirks and how different you are from people."
selfimprovement,fdbtm52,t1_fdbeuoo,1578261883.0,"I feel ya. 

I hated the thought of tracking everything digitally. But, i gave it a shot.... and still hated it. I tried so many different ways of organizing different aspects of my life through word, excel, and google sheets. It just wasn't working for me. 

Finally, after many forms of trial and error it clicked with me. I created my own Monthly planner, called my ""Action Plan"" where it holds everything i need for the month in a effective system. My planner has saved me so much and really keeps me going. I work it along with another document to store my jots/ideas. Then i also use my mini pocket journal to track my daily tasks and goals. I track my business ideas in there. I do semi-daily journal sessions in a organized manner. It really works for me. 

I'm building a business and MS word has really helped me get my head clear and strategize my life. I've been so highly effective and efficient the past few months that I've blown all my expectations out the window. 

I would experiment with mini journals, MS word documents, phone note pads, sticky notes, etc. Phone notes are cool to type/speech-text into and then organize all that stuff into 1,2, or 3 documents.

Just keep trying different things, eventually you'll get so fed up (like you are now) you will find something that works for you."

I use Google Sheets, its basically MS Excel but I have it connected to my phone and computer with less load time... I built my workout routine into there since I lift weights 6 days a week. It's been a blessing.

I've fooled around alot on MS word and built different kinds of systems of tracking information and keeping my goals and what not to work on. Nothing complicated at all. Just gotta get creative and run through trial and error.

I have a notepad on my phone that I store every important thought or task in. I have a designated hour every week to clean it.

My most important thing is my mini pocket journal. I write my monthly goals in there. I also write out everyday my tasks and what I need to accomplish.

If you are really struggling with tracking finances.. there are plenty of software programs to use. Or have physical bank statements sent to your house.

To end, I would highly suggest setting up routines. Like use Sundays or some night of the week and physically sit down for an hour and just organize your life."

You'll learn that alot of the time it's just trial and error. You'll fail countless times. It's just important to keep going. Try not to set your plate to big that, like you said, drains your willpower.

I've experimented alot of the past year with tons of different systems. I've built my own personal development systems that helps me build strong habits and work so much more efficiently.

selfimprovement,fd406rt,t3_ejztda,1578163184.0,"I thought alot of myself as I was reading through your post. I've been facing the same dilemma over the past few year.

What you see on YouTube and instagram is an illusion. Of course theres always those few people who are doing really well. Maybe .02% of the people you see on insta/YT. It's a numbers game really. 

What matters though is that you focus solely on yourself. Be selfish, man. You cant help anyone if you cant even help yourself. 

Literally throw yourself at everything and see what sticks. Experiment in different fields, routines, habits, etc. See what sparks with you. Try something for a week or two. If it requires to much willpower or effort and you dont absolutely love it, either revamp it or get rid of it.

I was a loser 4 years ago, but a friend of mine led me down a path that forever changed my life. Those first 3 years were hell trying to radically improve my life. But I hit something over the past year where everything is starting to come together.

My most important lessons were learning to throw myself at everything I possibly can, leaving my comfort zone and experiencing pain and depression, and putting myself in situations to succeed.

Life is really, really tough at times. The only way to progress is to go through pain. Target the hard things, that's where you'll experience the most growth. 

Learn to improve by 1% each day and years down the road you will sit back and be like ""Woa, wtf happened? I am a beast now!"" And then you'll chuckle and get back to grinding."

3. If you are interested in finding better sources of food, i have seen people on farms have Fly nesting compost bins. You could feed the Fly larvae (sorta like grubs) to your fish for a more organic and cheaper way of feeding.

4/5. You would need the fish for producing nutrients for your plants. You could go down the hydroponics route where you add nutrients to the water. That may make more sense for you unless you are trying to stay strictly organic.

The catfish dying is odd, they can survive in really rough conditions as they are very hearty. I would suggest Talapia if you can keep the water temperature decently high. Also, i know you said you used goldfish, you could also use Koi.

Years ago when I began this adventure into becoming a high achiever I would have never guessed that this would be my Achilles heel.

For most, it is extremely hard to preach about being a highly productive person and then have the ability to turn the switch off.

It's like managing a work-life balance for people who want to be big earners. It's very hard.

I still struggle with this, its a guilty pleasure. I can spend 100hours with work, school, and my side projects and still feel guilty to relax.

Entrepreneur,fcr4ji9,t3_eiij0q,1577896684.0,"To add to my previous comment about passive income being a thing...

Is that passive income is not necessarily straight passive. It's the ability to have your money/time work for you when you are not working.

You put in money/time upfront with the idea of having a continuous stream of cash flow coming through with minimum work after.

There are soooooooo many legit passive income ways. Maybe they wont make you a millionaire but the idea is to work off them. Keep making more and more passive income projects and eventually one will hit or they will all work together.

Make YouTube videos, teach classes, write a book, rent out your garage, rent out a house, buy stocks with dividends, build a website, etc
