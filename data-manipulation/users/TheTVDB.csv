Note my response here:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/esab53/another\_broken\_tv\_show\_listing/ff9uu8w/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/esab53/another_broken_tv_show_listing/ff9uu8w/) 

Based on us talking directly with Netflix, I'd say that we're less than 100% incorrect."
PleX,ff9uu8w,t3_esab53,1579721922.0,"I have some useful information on this.  Officially The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is entering its second season.  We interact with Netflix regularly and it's been confirmed that parts 1 and 2 were produced as a single season.  However, they list it in the interface as ""Part 1"" and ""Part 2"".  These are NOT official seasons.  Since we work directly with studios and production companies, we need to follow the official approach whenever possible, otherwise our information is factually incorrect and breaks systems that rely on factually correct information.  This includes instances where the popular approach would be to store them differently.

That said, in the relaunched website we have the capability of storing flexible seasons.  This means episodes can be cut and reordered in different ways within each series, beyond the standard air date, DVD, and absolute orders.  Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is one such example, where the official order will list season 1 and season 2 (which is about to drop) while the alternate order (which can be named ""Parts"" in the website) will contain Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3.  If you want a better example, Netflix completely recut Money Heist so there's no correlation between what's even in each individual episode.

The only issue right now is that API support for flexible seasons isn't done yet.  We're working on it.  The Plex team has already shown interest in this, and I fully expect other related software and systems will pick up on support very quickly as well."
sonarr,ff9tt14,t1_ff9cz45,1579721122.0,"Additionally, we don't expose the alternate orders in the API yet.  Flexible seasons are only used in a handful of shows right now, but as use expands we know getting it in the API will be important.

nfl,ff2an6z,t1_ff29s8a,1579498849.0,"Nick Bosa problems are compounded by having wide receivers that can't create separation.  This has been a trend all season and anyone that thinks Rodgers' issues are his alone, or the fault of the offensive line, hasn't been paying attention.  Adams is the only receiver that consistently gets open.  The other guys will make a good play here or there, but good receivers can consistently get open if there's a #1 receiver (Adams) drawing attention.  Nobody open means Rodgers has to hold the ball and scramble, which means he's more likely to take a sack, have a forced fumble, or throw a bad pass.  Our offensive woes are WR and TE, exclusively."

Any of the recommendations are good.  You questioned Peak Jiu Jitsu's pricing since they're close to you (which is super important the more you go).  Last summer they did a special of 6 weeks for $100 with 25% off a gi, a free intro class, free group class, and membership discount.  They likely do something similar all the time.

Schools ALWAYS run specials, so call them and say you want to get in and ask what their monthly fee is.  If it's over your budget, say that you'd love to but that you can only afford $X (whatever the amount is).  Most places wouldn't turn down a new student at a reasonable rate since they likely have run specials at that rate anyway.

Finally, don't worry about your size or condition. We have a couple guys in the 260-300 range that love it.

I definitely get both sides of it, knowing when they're being gentle and when they're not.  And it helps me pay close attention to my approach as well.

I do find that I roll very slow and focus on technique more as a result, but last night I decided to be as aggressive as possible while rolling with a bigger purple belt, a brown belt of the same size, and our black belt professor.  It was an entirely new experience for me, where I felt like my technique was still working but I was able to be more aggressive instead of just being reactionary.

I also kind of disagree with the idea that the coaching trees should be kept as short as possible.  I get that you want to keep the diagram simple, but it removes a lot of key information.

Machine repairman, expert woodworker, good at plumbing, carpentry, electrical, etc.  I learned a ton growing up as did my brother, who eventually became an electrician.  In my previous house I did most of the stuff myself.  I remodeled my basement and kitchen, laid tile, did landscaping, and a lot more.  I only relied on my brother for electrical because it scares the crap out of me and my dad for plumbing, because I hate doing it.

In our new house I paid to have everything done by other people.  My time is better spent doing other stuff, I don't really enjoy doing any of it, and I feel like I don't have anything to prove anymore.  There's no shame in not doing it yourself, just like there's no shame in those people paying someone to fix their computer or upholster their couch."

AskReddit,fdps73w,t1_fdpr76v,1578638439.0,"> People make fun of it because centrists will always talk about both sides as if they're equal in severity, not taking into account that the American left is a lot more to the right than the left in other nations. 

No, you're assuming that centrists are idiots and aren't taking this into account.  Personally, I'm well aware that the US is much further right than other countries.  I don't really care either way, since topics are better discussed on their merits than whether they're considered left or right.

As for the second part, obviously when having actual political discussions I'm not saying ""Trump has done some things right"".  I'll list those things that are relevant to the discussion, in the same way I'd list relevant mistakes.  Same for any other politicians brought into the discussion.

Most importantly, suggesting that centrists want to maintain the status quo is just downright ignorant.  I honestly think one of the biggest issues in America is Democrats and Republicans categorizing and labeling each other, and then refusing to have intelligent discourse based on those perceived stereotypes.  The Republicans did this way back with the ""tree hugger"" label and more recently by using ""socialist"" as a slur and Democrats have perfected it with ""women haters"" and ""racists"".  The status quo is what those on the far left and far right are doing... refusing to compromise and just yelling at each other."
AskReddit,fdpefcd,t1_fdp5lii,1578626513.0,"I can answer this because I get the ""enlightened centrist"" remarks all the time.  I'm a fiscal conservative and social liberal.  I tend to dislike things both parties do, but also see the value in the other things.  If you've spent the last however many years ridiculing the ""opponent"", and someone explains why that centrist stance, it detracts from their opinion that EVERYTHING the other side does is wrong.

Disclaimer: I didn't vote for Trump or Clinton and will probably vote third party again. I don't mind my ""vote not counting"".  However, I do think Trump has gotten some things right. But say that here on Reddit and you're usually met with complete hate and mockery.  It doesn't fit the narrative that Republicans, and especially Trump, can't do anything right.  Instead of debating the topics it's far easier to just label the person as an enlightened centrist, mock them, and go back to categorizing the other side as ""the enemy""."

I think there is value in Parrot's numbers as long as you understand what you're getting.  Social media activity can tell you that one show is generating more buzz than another and which way it's trending.  Through language processing you can sometimes tell why, too.  For companies spending millions producing this content, if data can drive a somewhat reasonable assumption, that's better than having no data at all.  The industry wants to be data driven but has a lack of data available outside of the streaming networks' self-reported numbers, which means they will grasp at any information available to them."
