entitledparents,fcy4yde,t3_eja4hi,1578074866.0,"In my country, most of our grandparents got married by the age of 15 or 16. I just turned 18 and my cousin (a guy) recently has a newborn brother. 

We were at one of our extended family's house for the festive season and I was very excited to hold my baby cousin for the first time. My cousin was standing next to me and I didn't notice we looked like a couple getting their first family photo. This is because an old woman (a granny) gestured to us and said, ""Both of your baby?"" 

It was really...awkward"
