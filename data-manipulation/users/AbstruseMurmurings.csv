One trick, if you want, is to use garden stakes and twine from the hardware store (or just get branches, if there are trees) and create a reinforced frame, then layer it with blankets (90inx90in felt-ish thin blankets, 9$ each, from Walmart) and you get a tent that can easily keep you warm.  Get something to sleep on, of course; the ground is the enemy.  At my temperature, I use several layers, but you can probably get away with less.  Plastic dropcloth, also from the hardware store, over the top.  Of course, this needs a place where you can expect it to be there tomorrow.

If you need the easier version, use such a blanket to cover the panels.  It keeps enough air in to warm you, but lets enough through that you don’t get rained on from your own condensation.

Edit: Also, get some paracord, so you can roll those blankets tightly and bind them up well.  They are about the size of a coffee thermos when bound, and you can lash them to the outside of a pack."

Well, after the render is done (24 hours or when the skin looks like white paper and the bones are totally stripped), you pour the whole thing into a strainer above a pot, let it drip dry for a few minutes, and then toss the contents of the strainer into compost or trash.

The fluid you have below is now a mix of water and the oils and fats; you don’t want the water.  Put the pot on highest boil for a sauce-reduction cycle, turn on the hood fans, and in an hour, you should be down to a small fraction of the original level.  One good trick is to wait for it to start changing color, but I can generally tell when to pull it by looking at the viscosity of the bubbles; you it starts to adhere to the bottom of the pot, you reduced it far too long.  What you now have is the schmaltz, the actual rendered chicken fat that you want, and it congeals into a solid in the fridge, with so little water left that it would last for a very long time.  I’ve never tested; I typically don’t keep it more than a week or two at most before I make a huge gravy pot with white flour and cornstarch.

I tend to serve a rye bread, the chicken that I took off of these bones, and the gravy as a base meal most nights, perhaps with a salad or something else thrown in for variety.  If you season and spice the gravy again while making it, and you mix rye flour and white flour for the bread, the meal is loaded with flavor, dirt cheap (the chicken used for this was 12$ of 1$/lb dark meat thigh, baked in the oven, meat torn off and stored in a bucket, and it just about filled my 6qt crock), fit for a weightlifter, and my bros never complain.  If you want to add more variety, add various berries or nuts to the bread to change the flavor each day.  The gravy is chicken-base, so it goes with nuts and anything sweet.  Gravy spices tend to be oregano, thyme, basil, rosemary, cardamom, and a bit of coriander and nutmeg, but any sweet or savory spice will work.

Amateur tip: Always keep the pot topped off; until the render is done, you want the bones totally submerged at all times.  Only after the render is done do you want to start reducing water content."
