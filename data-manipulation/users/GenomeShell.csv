Freud,ff8y998,t1_ff8uig1,1579699928.0,"One debate that I have heard of, with an argument somewhat against Freudian analysis, runs along the lines of ""The goal should be to efficiently fix what ails the client. Help them change their behavior. There is no need to spend a lot of time and energy on understanding any deeper causes."" Comparing Freudian analysis with some other approaches can be a bit apples-and-oranges.

Freud,ff8kemx,t1_ff8jegm,1579682692.0,"While waiting for an actual clinician to show up with a better answer,  free association is a way to get at what would otherwise be buried in the subconscious. People will go to extraordinary lengths to mask what is down there. The idea with therapy, I think, is to get that stuff out into the open so that one can at least have some understanding of why one does what one does. 

Full on Freud is scary stuff, which may be why people are (still, a century on) quick to take distance from his ideas. I'm a Freud enthusiast, I  have found his insights and approach to be very deep and valuable."

IWantOut,fdg8n2c,t3_el0rfr,1578384695.0,"I have some familiarity with Canada/Sweden and the US

Canada is closest to the US, culturally. A web/ui designer ""might"" be able to get a semi-under-the-table gig in Vancouver for a couple of months, set up a consulting company in the US and have them mail the paychecks (oops: consulting fees) there. International consulting is a thing, people working for a US company will do a small amount of work, for their US company, overseas, regularly. Don't let it go on for too long, pay your taxes in either the US or Canada, using an accountant, speak to the accountant before receiving the first dollar of pay.  Use the time on the ground to figure out what it will take to get a full working visa. 

Sweden. It looks great, is is a great place to be in many ways, but, integration is not always trivial. For Sweden (or Denmark): can you enroll as students, and spend a year or so there at low cost? On the ground, in school, you can develop personal networks and start figuring out what it will take to get a work permit and residency. 

To the extent that there are big US companies with website operations in Sweden, they might prefer a Yank in the role. You would have some small advantages as a ""US"" web designer. 

These days it might be possible to get professional work in Stockholm without speaking Swedish; lots of educated professionals are flowing in from the EU, it's possible to get by for six months or a year speaking mostly English to your colleagues. Still, to get a job you need contacts, back to spending a year in school first. Take evening classes in Swedish, in the long term you will want to be speaking Swedish. 

Ten years on you may find that Swedish democracy has a different set of problems than US democracy, but is still far from perfect. C'est la vie."

Yes, an 8 figure salary would be good if you expect to walk into good hospitals uninsured, have everybody pile on their bill, and just pay it. 

There can be a 20:1 difference between the ""uninsured"" price and the negotiated rate the insurance company pays, if and only if the patient is in an ""in-system"" hospital. That's towards the high end but there is often a huge difference. ""Uninsured"" people of course can't often pay $150K, so they don't, eventually the hospital sells a bunch of unpaid bills to a law firm for 3-5% of the amount, the law firm files hundreds of lawsuits at once, at full value + interest, and makes some money, drives others people into medical bankruptcy, whatever, they aren't anybody else's problem by that point.

Legal recognition won't happen even in twenty years, married filing jointly etc. won't work with either a bridge or an animal.

Widespread social acceptance of ""marrying"" an animal in twenty years: yes this seems likely. I think this has most to do with the changing nature of sex over the last fifty years. In the old world, sex was a kind of inverse russian roulette, every time a new human life may be started. Religions obsess about the rules of sex, since such sex is a high-consequence action. Take that human life creation aspect away, through perfect birth control, choice of partner, or whatever, and what is left is at most an emotional thing. Not obviously anyone else's business.
