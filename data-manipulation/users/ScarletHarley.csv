IMHO... that information should be made more clear- both so it can be found (and accessed) by those who need the message as intended - and, so that it's clear it's not to be interpreted as an umbrella justification for any self-indulgent, harmful agenda."

I haven't really noticed any sort of similar patterns across the taller men I've dated, but at any rate you can't fix boring or dumb.

If someone doesn't get my jokes, or, say, *just doesn't read books*, height isn't going to win me over."

fatlogic,fdl4gki,t1_fdkufwk,1578516887.0,"I see what you did there. 
Nicely done.

In my own experience, (aside from the discomfort with high heels) the resentful short guys seem to have much more they think they have to prove around other guys. This weird defensive aggression... I am actually realizing how similar it is to the people who are making their fat the subject of every situation or interaction.

Been married to a 5'6"" guy for almost 7 years now, (together for over 8). He doesn't give a damn how tall we are."
fatlogic,fdkpedr,t1_fdklw9v,1578508388.0,"There's also a whole lot to consider about the attitude people - mostly men in my personal experience, but not limited to - develop regarding their height.

I am somewhat taller than average for a woman - (5'8ish/5'-9 depending on what time of day I am measured) and have had several long relationships with men a bit shorter than me. 
Attitude is a big factor. I don't give a damn if someone is short but ""short man syndrome"" is a real thing. The dudes who feel defensive about their height and feel they've got something to prove are the worst."
fatlogic,fdkj5l3,t3_eluim9,1578504828.0,"What is the alternative they would expect, then?

Condescension?

How would they respond to similar applications of this idea?

""I'm sorry I didn't invite you to my wedding, I just know you're single and have had bad luck with relationships for years, so I didn't want to make you feel bad. I felt it was more considerate to leave you out.""

""Sorry, Mom, I didn't acknowledge you on mother's day because YOUR mom passed away years ago and I didn't want to remind you.""

""I'm sorry I didn't dress nicely for your event, I just know how broke you are and didn't want my Prada to show up your... um...hand-me-downs. So I wore rags.""

...

It's one thing to be reasonable and considerate. I wouldn't whine about feeling bloated or fat around a friend who is actually fat. But ffs."

Yes, please comment on how I *CAN JUST EAT AAANNNNNYTHING* and still be slim. Because I am going to town on this meal on this particular occasion KNOWN for being indulgent and food-centric.

Really, seriously make one more fucking comment implying that stuffing my face today (with turkey and pie and God knows everything else) is a reflection on what I eat the rest of the time."""
fatlogic,fdkeyyi,t3_eluh9x,1578502450.0,"It's almost like there is more than one possibility for any particular circumstance!

I have several friends who have bald heads.

One of them chooses to shave her head for aesthetic reasons, one is growing bald in a way that's not uncommon in men of a certain age, and one has fucking cancer and dealing with the effects of chemo.

How could I ever wrap my head around the possibility that I treat someone's choice differently from someone's tragedy? Oh my goodness, how could I muster up such outrage?!?
