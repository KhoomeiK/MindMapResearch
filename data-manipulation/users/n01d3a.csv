2. If this pushes away a kid, getting as tame as it is, there were multiple failures everywhere amongst the process.

3. People who record this kind of shit to put on the internet for attention don't have the mental faculty to process the big picture anyways."

wholesomememes,ffuxw51,t1_ffuwysc,1580251439.0,I think it's a chili like thing but you may also be correct.
wholesomememes,ffuxics,t1_ffuw91e,1580251224.0,"You forgot a dash of nutmeg, but yeah there's no other way to do it. I like to leave my bread out for a bit to let the surface get ""stale."" Chefs like Alton Brown and such have recommended it for better structure after absorption, I like it."

JusticeServed,fdxo38c,t1_fdxk925,1578771122.0,"I'm not sympathizing with people that deserve to rot in prison until they die, or with enablers of heinous acts. But if you know that blowing those people (Weinstein, Epstein) will only ruin your own career while the accused party goes free. 

I've seen many movie celebrities mentioned on here in Epstein's case that only (allegedly) did charity case things. Even if they knew, why ruin their careers if it had nothing to do with them?"

whatisthisthing,fcsuf4y,t1_fcss3tj,1577925375.0,"Ah, okay. But that doesn't seem nearly as bad. Especially seeing as those are considered vermin in almost any instance. How would that even compare?

I'd be more concerned about the bee population through insecticides."
