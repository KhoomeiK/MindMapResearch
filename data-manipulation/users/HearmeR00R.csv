It's more powerful than any other piece of physical evidence because it itself is in every part of your body.  It tells a physical story that can't be argued.  The only subjective thing is how did the DNA get there and why.  I'm sure there'll new unpredictable advances in the future though.  But it's chance of error is beyond any doubt."

It's something that can be used to exonerate the wrongly charged or convicted.  I'm not talking about Kobe because I'm not too familiar with what happened.  But how has DNA ever been bad?"

iamatotalpieceofshit,fezupt5,t1_feztd8p,1579461903.0,"Not necessarily how it works.  Theyll often use a grand jury to determine that.  Heightened state doesn't relegate a lesser charge necessarily.  It depends a lot on if they inflicted ""serious bodily injury"" or if the guy could've been killed.  That's where medical experts come into play.  I've seen a case where a man beat someone so severely without a weapon he was convicted for attempted murder in the second degree.  Got 5 years and served every day.  Felony assault is usually with SBI.  Theres different degrees of felony assault as well.  This is just in my jurisdiction in Texas though."

Just filet them ASAP.  I'm assuming they're taking them to where they're going to process these fish.  Some people keep them on ice.  I keep them alive on a stringer.

Wasnt tucking flour tortillas aren't Mexican lol.  Jesus christ.
tacos,fe8577w,t1_fe851zf,1578922713.0,Wasn't bashing... they're just more popular in american tacos.  Doesnt mean I dont think theyre not tacos dude.  You're spare parts bud

Cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomatoes are just more american is all I meant.  I wasnt ragging on the guy just thought it was interesting a European place chose those ingredients.  You don't need to act so upset.  Like I said I dig all tacos and the steak looked dank.  Btw he said they were filled with red beans and other stuff like a burrito... which aren't a mexican thing.

Physical therapy was one of the first things I did.  That was about 6 or 7 years ago when it first statted.  Along with LESIs in my back.  The epidural steroids helped cor a few months.  Physical therapy no longer helps.  Stretching and forcing myself to walk and do yoga barely helps anymore.  I'm at the point where I've pissed myself and I feel like I need to pee all the time.  Are you familiar with cauda equina?  That's where I'm at.  I'm only 30 and my doctors are doing all they can.  It's considered an elective surgery until it's an absolute emergency.  When I lost control of bladder and pissed myself, I went to the hospital.  They sent me home after giving me fentanyl.  Sorry about the rant bud.  I just feel pretty hopeless.  I make just barely too much money for any governmental help.  I'm sick of being constipated from the hydrocodone and the whole cocktail of pills. I'll try anything at this point.

One tip is to limit carbohydrates.  My doctor told me they're natural inflammatories.  Losing weight helped me too.  Was worse when I was 240.  About 215 now.  Its degenerative disc disease so I'm just dreading the day it gets worse.  But like you said over the stove is the worst position lol.  And I love cooking!  Should be enough for the damn insurance company to let me have surgery.  They grind my existing discs up and mix it with a synthetic paste and replace them.. super invasive but I'd gladly try it.
