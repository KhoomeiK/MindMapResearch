- killing bad things and breaking down food is what your stomach is for

- killing bad things that get through your stomach is a large part of your gut bacteria, or at least a very passionate hobby. 

- figuring out how all these bacteria and our health fit together is one of the challenges of the next decade(s), it appears to be that white blood cells (the destroyers of evil bacteria) communicate on some level with bacteria for example.

- with high enough bacterial count.. *maybe*, but you really have no idea how many bacteria are in your guts and mine, trillions upon trillions. Adding a few billion or million won't do much unless you're lucky and or know exactly what you're doing. < that's what all the future research is for. This whole system is called the microbiome, you would also probably find fecal microbiota transplant or FMT interesting :)"

explainlikeimfive,ffffvhy,t1_fff8yai,1579883065.0,"Most probiotics are pretty useless as they cannot get through the stomach, so calling them probiotics is misleading/ a lie.

Also, of those bacteria that get through the stomach into the intestines, it is a very small number, like plonking 2 Italian guys in China and expecting them to fix the country's woes. Only it would probably be more like plonking 1 Italian guy's small toe in China, or 1 Italian skin flake."
explainlikeimfive,ffffj7w,t1_fffd840,1579882852.0,"> Antibiotics most often don't kill bacteria so much as they just limit their ability to reproduce.

And it also does this for good bacteria. Most antibiotics are broad spectrum. 

Ps. antibiotics target a vulnerability, a weakness in bacteria, one of these is dividing/reproduction, there are others.

Is that estimate made by the same people who listened to scientists talk about drastically reducing tuna fishing quotas because they could go extinct and then increased the quotas because reducing it would be hugely inconvenient?

Is it perhaps made by the fishermen who caught almost all the cod off Canada's coast and yet wanted to continue catching cod until there was nothing left?

Is it from the people who have known about climate change for half a century and have never given a single fuck about it?

Oh, I know! It was made by the people in the Australian government who wanted to fine officials for letting tourists know that the great barrier reef was dead/dying because nobody in their right mind would visit a grey, dead, barren wasteland!
