educationalgifs,fh7z82k,t1_fh7hxvv,1581348420.0,Thanks for this answer. Bunch of upvoted junk above you failing to explain this.
news,fh7x8ts,t1_fh767st,1581347058.0,Unfortunately large countries with material wealth don’t just collapse and wink out. Pretty sure there would be decades of more and more widespread suffering before things could turn around if they ever do.
space,fgsnonr,t1_fgsjm4o,1581088709.0,"Where do you think NASA money has always gone? NASA does not engineer its own rockets and spacecraft. The Saturn 5 was build by Boeing, Douglas, and North American. The Apollo lander modules were built by Grumman. The Space Shuttle was built by Boeing and Rockwell with Lockheed Martin handling the solid boosters."
news,fgqxlyn,t1_fgqj5u5,1581033636.0,It’s entirely possible he isn’t a racist but is an asshole who identifies what will he most hurtful to use against a person. I have known a few like this who I don’t believe harbored much prejudice but would absolutely let bigoted garbage fly out of their mouths in whatever form suited their target.
YangForPresidentHQ,fgfrroh,t1_fgfoq49,1580746148.0,"Yeah I like yang because unlike the republicans, he acknowledges the problems we face under capitalism but doesn’t want to just throw the whole thing out. The idea of correcting its flaws and taking care of those it leaves behind while continuing to use it as the engine of productivity and innovation sounds like the happiest future to me. It’s baffling to me that so many progressives just wanna throw out all the babies with the bath water."
pics,fg1rm0e,t1_fg15ag9,1580432179.0,"I really don’t have any good reason to doubt French food, but just to play devils advocate, the culinary terms we all use might be French because French food might *have been*  the best at a time France was culturally and politically dominant. Before Britain took over the world. That might have been a period of unprecedented globalization and the whole western world adopted that aspect of French culture and kept it. It doesn’t say anything about the state of French food compared to everyone else’s now."
centrist,fg16cb1,t3_ew8gih,1580421610.0,I think what’s new is that the left has a large population of snowflakes. The right has had moral snowflakes for a long time that were offended over religion and tradition. So it’s a little different now but the new left is unique for creating the concepts of safe spaces and trigger warnings and such. This are obvious targets of the label. So I don’t know which is worse but we are used to the snowflakes of the right so I think it feels like the left is worse.
educationalgifs,ffy25n2,t1_ffxxs3e,1580337105.0,So coffee didn’t exist until the espresso machine was invented?
TumblrInAction,ffx1njs,t1_ffx1aer,1580315830.0,Fair enough. But the point of the post we are making fun of is that the war was a result of the ambitions and politics of white countries which is mostly correct.
AskReddit,ffwxowq,t1_ffw8n6x,1580313361.0,I think you are downvoted mostly because of your irreverence. It’s near impossible to prove WHY societies have the norms that they do but it’s entirely logical to protect the women. A tribe that loses half of its women will have a diminished population for a long long time because they can only have babies so fast. A tribe that loses half its men can recover in one generation.
TumblrInAction,ffwwzkl,t3_evo6ic,1580312914.0,It’s pretty fair to call WW1 a white war. The Gallipoli campaign was the exception where the  Ottomans did something significant but the vast vast majority of the fighting was between the Germans and the French/British/Russians. Certainly most POCs were there at the behest of their British or French colonial masters. The Japanese only got involved to steal some shit from Germany while they weren’t looking. Obviously you would have to be pretty ignorant to make that argument about WW2.
funny,ffrmssx,t1_ffrjpgz,1580161288.0,"Yeah it may not be total squalor either. People have different mess thresholds where their housekeeping urges begin. The clean person takes care of every mess a day before it occurs to the messy person that something needs cleaning. The clean person washes the two dishes in the sink and the messy person never thinks to do dishes until there is a pile. Now the clean person is pissed because the messy person never does anything. 

Good faith communication is needed before anyone explodes out of rage."
askscience,ffjfvzp,t1_ffjegb9,1579997388.0,Well it would have to be higher than geostationary so that it could hold up its own weight.
worldnews,ffim5gj,t1_ffib06b,1579977183.0,"Yeah that’s confusing. China of all places can probably ship in 10,000 doctors overnight to wherever they are needed with that level of top down control. I can’t tell if our media is way overblowing it? Or if the actual epidemic is orders of magnitude larger than reported. 

This reminds me of the line abo Chernobyl. Something like The USSR is the only place this could have happened, and the only place that could have solved it."
OutOfTheLoop,ffg9hcx,t1_fffwnj5,1579901346.0,"Shapiro is a middle of the road conservative. Alex Jones is a fucking nut. Peterson is a mystical self help guru who reveres “western culture” and says women symbolize chaos in the Bible. The first one is good to hear if you wanna take the political temperature of half the country and the other two are straight up entertainment.

I don’t think it makes sense to mention those three in the same statement."
OutOfTheLoop,ffg8gfs,t1_ffg5122,1579900717.0,"Do you have examples of the dangerous viewpoints he hasn’t challenged? If you consider Ben Shapiro dangerous then sure. But Ben Shapiro is a solidly middle of the road Republican who closely mirrors the average views of right leaning people in the US.

I think the net effect of his show is politically pretty neutral but positive in that it exposes people to how others think."
explainlikeimfive,fffhbly,t1_fff999x,1579883960.0,"Yeah it’s weird that people think of drone strikes as indiscriminate killing. They are a vast improvement over the techniques of the past. Certainly surgical compared to a high altitude bombing but they still fuck up. Our standards are just (rightfully) getting higher.

Edit: I think it might be because they are so cheap and low risk (to us). So people fear they are used with less discretion than either planes with people in them or boots on the ground."
Showerthoughts,fffgbob,t1_ffeyskl,1579883342.0,It’s that combination of near adult size and erratic childlike behavior that made them so scary I think
personalfinance,fff9qkn,t3_etb0ju,1579879176.0,"Congrats. With the money I’ve blown on booze since college graduation I could have a very very nice car. Not to mention how as you get older, weekend binge drinking really starts to affect your job/life performance throughout the week. It’s awesome you are kicking it so young."
explainlikeimfive,ffdky2a,t1_ffdgxkh,1579823074.0,I think we are just more sensitive to subtle differences in people that look like ourselves. When a white person who doesn’t hang with a lot of black people sees a black person they only notice the superficial characteristics instead of the little things that they use to differentiate white people. I don’t think this is unique to whites.
news,ffd3m3p,t1_ffd0iug,1579812762.0,I agree. But I think it’s silly when people object anytime someone uses a weaker word. I don’t think everyone is obligated to use the strongest possible language every time she is mentioned.
news,ffctsj2,t1_ffcfvbk,1579807108.0,Those terms aren’t mutually exclusive
TheExpanse,ffaix15,t1_ffad3nr,1579736839.0,"> Even in a location that's closer to the center of spin, the liquid would still fall straight down, only more slowly, accelerating as it approaches the outer edge of the spinning object. 

Wait are you sure that’s right? I’m pretty sure a dropped object will drift anti-spinward. Conservation of angular momentum suggests its angular velocity with respect to the station axis will drop as the distance to the center increases. Like if a human goes “downstairs” on a spinning station. The human has to steal some angular momentum from the station to accelerate him to the linear velocity of the outer part of the station. In free fall that can’t happen so things will lag behind."
YangForPresidentHQ,ff45nct,t1_ff3yqx9,1579556078.0,"Yeah i heard the original freakonomics interview and was mildly interested but quickly forgot about it because I didn’t feel I had the bandwidth to get invested in a long shot candidate. But I came out of Rogan and immediately joined the Facebook groups and subreddit and donated $50. So who knows what it will take to get people to care. 

I think maybe we should only recommend Rogan to people who already like Rogan or to people with long commutes who have lots of time for listening to stuff."
natureismetal,ff44xce,t1_ff3umzy,1579555622.0,"If I could pay to have the strength, speed, and claws of a big cat I’d do it in a heartbeat. But us humans have to make do with our tools."
nottheonion,ff3j2lz,t1_ff2t9jk,1579542112.0,"Jeez these people replying to you really don’t believe hard work matters at all. Like I get that circumstances determine where you start. But they don’t determine whether you move up or down. Even if it’s a false dream to be a self made millionaire or whatever for most people, I thought it was obvious that hard work could inch you up the ladder. Certainly compared to not trying at all."
askscience,fewjjed,t1_fewhgwt,1579411907.0,"Yeah the total momentum you can transfer to your opponent’s head is greater because of the glove’s mass. A boxer can accelerate the hand and glove almost as fast as just the hand but with more mass. Even though the glove is soft, conservation of momentum still applies so the head gets quickly accelerated which knocks the brain around inside the skull."
askscience,fewjdby,t1_fewgn4l,1579411791.0,Overestimate the protective ability? They protect the hands quite well. But the additional mass ends up causing more damage to the brain even if their softness reduces damage to the skin.
gadgets,feo7evo,t1_feo565d,1579296155.0,Yeah hopefully this won’t be standard for flagship iPhones. I get that I don’t have to buy it but it sucks having to settle.
gadgets,fene9w2,t1_fendcia,1579282825.0,It’s a pretty big problem for people who take their phones hiking/backpacking for photos and maps. We rely on mobile battery packs for multi day trips. If charging efficiency is cut in half I need twice as much battery. Same for music festivals.
funny,fekym30,t1_fekslx0,1579210304.0,Disgusting is a strong word. Way thiccer than I’d like? Yes definitely. But i reserve disgusting for shapeless peopleofwalmart blobs. If you are gonna be obese It might as well be distributed nicely like it is here

houston,fek7hx9,t1_fek2y33,1579194218.0,That’s because it’s in the best interest of the news to make it sound juicy.
houston,fek3qbm,t1_fek0en1,1579191967.0,I see. If it was truly an accident then it could be argued that “the gun killed people” so it becomes important to hold that semantic line. Well that’s dumb. Negligent drivers kill people every day with their cars. It’s both negligent and accidental. I don’t know why they can’t both be true. What’s wrong with a spectrum of responsibility with criminal malicious intent on one end and unavoidable accident with no negligence on the other? Plenty of space along that spectrum for partial responsibility or negligence without bad intent.
houston,fejwbot,t1_fejtu4b,1579187341.0,Maybe wait until we know who’s gun it is before demanding heads
houston,fejw9u4,t1_fejofos,1579187308.0,Man you are really hung up on the semantics here. Can it not be both? It’s pretty clear there was no intent to shoot another student. Obviously there is negligence all over this but that doesn’t make it not an accident.
science,fei4zkc,t1_fehdvty,1579130404.0,"And had it turned out the other way around, that only Africans had Neanderthal ancestry, they still would have used it to justify their beliefs."
facepalm,fe92nec,t1_fe8zrcg,1578933513.0,"If you know anything about Uber eats, doordash, this or any of those services you know that the company doesn’t give a fuck about whether it’s “employees” can actually make money. The driver probably gets $3 for the whole delivery. If he has to spend 20 minutes circling for parking and then 10 minutes finding his way though gates and visitor entrances and navigating to the door then he’s fucked. Which is why I will take two minutes out of my day to meet at the street and get my food while it is still hot. 

I agree the company shouldn’t advertise it when it isn’t practical. but if you live in a difficult to reach place, you should really use your brain and understand that just because they technically said they would come to your door doesn’t mean they reasonably can."
facepalm,fe8za9f,t1_fe88ult,1578932499.0,We don’t know enough about this apartment to judge whether it is reasonable to expect delivery to the door. I have lived in places where parking and gaining access to the complex would take way too long and be such a pain that the driver would probably lose money in the process.
Showerthoughts,fe0c85o,t1_fe0bmb8,1578809467.0,It’s because industry needed people more than people needed the jobs. There were more slots than there were laborers in the post WW2 US so it made sense for those companies to try really hard to keep their people. That was a temporarily awesome situation for American laborers.
history,fds7af0,t1_fdrfk49,1578695963.0,"Hmm is that really true? As I understand it there were points much later in the war where France came close to cracking under the pressure. What if Britain had been unwilling to lose 700,000 lives and backed out or just took a much smaller role?"
