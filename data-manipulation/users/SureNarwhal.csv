SuicideWatch,ff814gx,t1_ff73mpb,1579663255.0,"I find having a plan a comfort because it's an exit strategy.  Of course, can't tell anyone about that or they'll report you.  Plans are considered a sign of risk of harm to self.  Which is stupid.  I've had plans for years.  Still here.  And putting me in hospital would make me worse, not better.

I find the random thoughts less comforting.  I don't want to imagine crashing my car into a pole.  Or other various horrible things.  But I do.  I don't think it's necessary about suicide most of the time though.  I think it's my anxiety which generally forces me to think terrible things.  I have no say in it.  Especially because it usually includes what would happen after, even though I know that's stupid because, welly, I would not be here, so why worry?"
depression,ff30ur9,t1_ff24ha4,1579530671.0,"That's right, you don't know the situation.  I think a lot of people who say things like this come from families where children should never have been brought into it.  It's not just the depression talking.  

I mean, let's look at my family.  My parents are emotionally abusive and completely fucked up my development.  There's a family history of anxiety and depression and whether it was environment or genetics, I have them both.  So right from the start you've got shitty parents, a shitty environment, and shitty genetics.  

And to cap it all off, my parents let slip that the only reason they decided to have kids was because of social pressure.  They never actually wanted any, but then everyone else started having kids, so they changed their minds.  It wasn't some burning desire to be a parent.  Not that I think that would mitigate things.

Yeah, no, my parents should never have fucking had me.  In fact, it's quite clear from the way they have treated me that if they could change things, I wouldn't exist and they'd only have my sister, who they like better.  Though, imo, they shouldn't have had any children, even if they treat her better than me."
depression,fewdnxz,t3_eqm292,1579408849.0,"Yeah me too.  The worst part for me is when things look like they could get better only for it to be snatched away.  People say hope is wonderful, but that's only for those who win at life in the end.  For those of us who lose, it's the worst torment."
depression,feni9p7,t3_epzjky,1579285273.0,"Well, all I can say is that it is worse not to have success and be depressed.  My depression really started when I lost the thing I love the most.  And that's the worst thing for me - having incurable situational depression.  I know the cause and it's irreparable.  No pill or therapy can fix it.  There were times I was depressed before that (again, situational - being a constant target for bullying will make any person depressed), but this thing really brought me out of it and I was doing well.  Then I lost it and I can't get it back.  That sent me off a cliff.  Since then, I have been severely depressed.  And, until the past year or so, I did have some success.  I can tell you that having that success gives you something (even if it can't fix your depression or fill that void) and losing it certainly makes things much worse.  For example, having a job gives you at least some financial stability, it gives you something to do every day, and it gives you some self-worth.  Even if you hate it.  But if you lose it, like I did?  All that reverses and just makes the depression worse.  It can always get worse."
depression,felifve,t3_epiyby,1579222938.0,"I often imagine that I'm a different person in a different world.  Not necessarily a perfect one, I think that would make it all too unreal for me, but one that is better than me in every possible way.  It's the only way I can sleep.  If I don't do this, I just lie awake, worrying endlessly."
Anxiety,felgiav,t3_epl7xu,1579221632.0,"I'm not so sure that there even is a ""me"" anymore..."
Anxiety,felfyya,t1_fejl8sr,1579221270.0,"I think the word 'wallow' also implies that it's a choice and there's some blame to be assigned.  At least, that's how it's usually used.  I certainly have never heard it not used that way (except in reference to the bathing/cooling habits of large mammals).  I don't think it should be used in reference to mental health conditions."
Anxiety,felfhj2,t3_eppd26,1579220942.0,"Most of the time I use distraction as well...  But, if the thing I am worrying about is something that actually cannot or hasn't happened, sometimes I can remind myself of the fact of its impossibility or extreme improbability.  But most things I worry about are not impossible or improbable things.  The only other thing I do is something that usually doesn't apply (at least not for me and what I tend to think about) - sometimes you can take action against the source of the anxiety.  There was a tree that was causing me great anxiety (it was dying and I constantly feared it falling) and I had the municipality cut it down.  Now there is no tree."
Anxiety,fegkw0u,t3_eoxhbw,1579095935.0,"I can relate to this.  People keep telling me to meditate.  I used to be able to meditate, I did it for reasons unrelated to mental health, but because of something that happened to me, meditation itself is triggering for my depression and anxiety.  If I try to explain that, then people don't actually listen or care.  They think because it helped them or because it helps some people, that therefore it must help everyone and if I don't do it, then I am to blame for being the way I am.  One person actually said ""you have to get over that at some point"".  

I really don't think people say it because they are interested in helping.  If they were really interested in helping, then they would listen when the person responds that it isn't effective.  But they don't.  It's about making them feel like they helped and feel good about themselves.  And shifting the onus to the person who isn't well, so that no one has to feel bad for not helping enough, rather the person can be blamed for just not working hard enough.

People do this with all mental health treatments.  If you won't do what someone wants and thinks you should, then you are not trying and you are to blame for not being well.  It can't be that they don't know what they are talking about because they're not a professional or that you actually have tried it before and found it ineffective or that the treatment isn't suited to your particular condition/symptoms or anything else.  They say if you won't do exactly what they suggested immediately and keep trying over and over and over, then you don't want to get better.  I hate people."
Anxiety,fefgwe0,t1_fefgapn,1579056071.0,"In that way, I find it much better than life.  If only I could sleep all the time."
depression,fefgnll,t3_eork3x,1579055924.0,"I was raised atheist, so I don't know the difference.  I never had faith to lose.  I actually find it comforting that all this will end.  Especially when I figured out that death is probably just the same non-existence as before I was born.  No memory, no pain, no...anything."
depression,fefg9c8,t3_eos95f,1579055689.0,"Depends.  For me, I think it's my circumstances.  I mean, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that having emotionally abusive parents, losing the one thing you love, having an abusive boss, being fired by said abusive boss, and then being stuck unemployed with no prospect of leaving your parents' house anytime soon - this will make you depressed.  I do not think it is normal not to be depressed when your life is shit and keeps getting worse."
SuicideWatch,feffge2,t1_fedj7r0,1579055204.0,"I don't really agree.  There are some things that you can only look at them one way.  Some things can't be fixed and can't be perceived differently.  Trying to pretend otherwise...it's distorting reality.  Some people can do it anyway, probably.  Some people are good at self-deception.  I'm not."
Anxiety,fefb83p,t3_eosvjc,1579052494.0,Yes.  If I have too much caffeine I start shaking and get (more) paranoid.  I've cut out most sugary drinks (including juice) for health reasons and stopped drinking coffee except when necessary for social reasons.  I mostly stick with water or tea for beverages.
Anxiety,fefafe2,t3_eohpso,1579051965.0,"I hate all times of day, but if I can actually sleep, it's better (the trick is, of course, getting to sleep and staying that way).  I don't have good dreams or anything.  Most of the time they are bad, actually.  Probably my anxiety and depression manifesting.  

But I find that when I am asleep, I'm not really able to think in my dreams, for some reason.  I don't have any thoughts.  I just exist and I feel and react to things automatically.  No thought, no choice, it just happens.  It has always been like that.

And for some reason, I don't feel the anxiety or depression I feel when awake...even if I am experiencing terror or pain (I get very accurate physical sensations).  I have no idea how or why."
SuicideWatch,fee872q,t3_eokb1t,1579028400.0,"I don't know what to say, except that it is true.  People say that they will be there for you, that you can trust them, that they care...but ultimately they always leave, don't they?  Or worse, they betray.  This always happens to me."
Anxiety,fe5vtwl,t1_fe5g9z8,1578876078.0,"Not necessarily.  There's a whole branch of philosophy (metaphysics) about shit like this...including this specific scenario.  Thinking about things like this is not, on its own, disassociation."
depression,fe5uw92,t1_fdzel8d,1578875492.0,"The problem is, though, when you have so much past experience with people not liking you and being horrible human beings...the evidence says that they will never like you, you should never trust them, they are always horrible, etc.  It's not distorted thinking when it's true, afterall."
depression,fe5urcf,t3_enrs4c,1578875403.0,"It's not that I feel that I'm lying or exaggerating, but I am afraid that other people will believe that.  Or they will misunderstand in the worst way.  Because in my experience, that's exactly what will happen.  Therefore, I do not talk about my mental health.  Without legal assurances, I cannot trust anyone enough to do so."
Anxiety,fe4xr4u,t1_fe4wwdm,1578863837.0,Is it?  I suppose that could be why I can't remember the normal parts or any good parts that happened.  I wish I could forget all the bad things though.  Who wants a head full of your parents shouting and people bullying you?
depression,fe4x6sp,t3_enqkiy,1578863636.0,"Oh sure.  Not that things were ever good, really, but there were at least good moments in the past.  As much as I hated my childhood, I was much more innocent then and there were moments when I did feel happiness, I think.  Now, there's nothing really good about life.  I can't really remember those feelings because I can't feel things properly and my memory is all fucked up, but I think I did.  Well, until something triggers it...like you said, it's gut wrenching."
depression,fdw0bd6,t1_fdtsysb,1578753621.0,"I would read those agreements carefully.  They always have exceptions that include self-harm.  If a counselor or therapist decides that what you say means that you constitute an imminent risk to yourself or others, they can and will report you.  And that can result in psychiatric holds.

I'm not trying to discourage people from seeking help, but they should be aware of what they are signing and the potential consequences.  It may be different in other countries, but in my country people who have actually experienced this often say that those psychiatric holds are more damaging than helpful.  Being held in a hospital for a couple days doesn't provide meaningful treatment and can often traumatize a person.

I know someone who went voluntarily because they were feeling suicidal and thought that it was what they should do.  It's what people encourage you to do - go to the hospital if you feel like that.  He said that they didn't help him and the people there, likely involuntarily, were just drugged.  One of them was just lying on the floor and any time they started to move a nurse would come over and inject them with something.  It honestly sounded like something out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Like an asylum.

For me...I am terribly afraid of those places.  I'm terrified of having things done to me against my will and I'm phobic of needles, so it's even worse.  The idea of someone stabbing me with a needle as they do to non-consenting patients...  I would come out of there much worse than I went in, undoubtedly.  If I ever came out."
Anxiety,fds5j6s,t3_emwmv8,1578694828.0,"Yes, although not in relation to my anxiety.  I hope my experience helps you.

When I was in university, I developed a medical condition that required accommodation.  Prior to this happening, I hadn't needed any accommodation.  My anxiety at the time was not the sort that requires accommodation in an academic environment.

It was very hard for me to cope with.  You see, I was an excellent student, an over-achiever, the sort that provided help rather than asked for it.  And then, suddenly, I did need help.  And I felt a lot like you, I think.

I felt ashamed to need help when others didn't need it.  I felt like it wasn't fair for me to have help when others didn't.  I felt like my accomplishments weren't worth as much.  And I felt the usual anger and unfairness that I had become unwell in the first place.  Why me, right?

I think that these are pretty common feelings, especially because of the prejudice society has towards people who need accommodation.  People often say it is an advantage for people with medical conditions (or really anything requiring accommodation) to get that help, like it's cheating.  Even if you don't expressly believe it, it's easy to internalize that if you're exposed to that.  And if you then develop a medical condition that needs accommodation, it can cause a lot of self-hatred.

But it's not actually true.  It's making things fair.  And this is what I eventually came to understand.  When a person has a condition, a disability, it is not their fault and even if it was, they shouldn't be denied the ability to participate in society because of it.  

Having accommodations to make sure that people like us can do well at university isn't screwing the other students, it is making sure that it is fair for everyone.  It's no different than if someone breaks their arm and can't write, they would be allowed to have someone write down their answers for them on the exam rather than just fail them because they can't use their arm.

I hope this helps.  It took me years to figure this out and sometimes I still feel bad.  Let's just say, people can be assholes."
Anxiety,fds2rdy,t3_emuz5w,1578693480.0,"I think that if it is starting to make you feel bad, then you need to at least take a break from it.  My experience with social media is that it has a negative effect on mental health.  Or at least, it did for me and it does for many people.  There are a lot of problems with it, but the main thing is that it doesn't really show what people's lives are like.  

People put their best selves (or sometimes not even their real selves) on social media.  And it creates this world where everyone is always looking great, having the best time, buying awesome things, etc.  It's not real, of course - as I said, it's selective and/or faked - but it looks real.  And it can make people who are not living that sort of life or who are struggling feel worse about themselves.

Social media started to make me feel like that a while ago.  Everyone seemed like they were doing so well and I'm not really doing so well.  Every time I logged in, I felt rather like you did.  Eventually I decided not to look anymore.  Am I missing out?  Maybe.  But I think it's worse to check and feel like that."
Anxiety,fdrxic5,t1_fdqvapk,1578691259.0,"That's true.  But the other side of the coin is how people are treated the moment their symptoms are attributed to mental illness or they are diagnosed with it.  The moment that happens, they are often subject to prejudice and often don't receive the same quality of care because doctors are less likely to believe them, less likely to take their complaints seriously, less likely to view them as competent and respect them, and so on.  There are studies on the subject that I read back in university.  People think I'm paranoid, but there's good reason I'm resistant to engaging the medical system any further in regard to mental health.  For me, the risk isn't worth it.  I don't want any more of it on my record."
