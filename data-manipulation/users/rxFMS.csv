AskReddit,ffu41yo,t3_ev5zdg,1580234039.0,"Just this morning. Very moving funeral service for my 87 year old uncle.  The whole town came out to celebrate his life.  We were all in tears. 

Then he had us all sing “zipidy do dah” on our way out the church. Laughing and crying at the same time."

todayilearned,ffso4bs,t1_ffsmup2,1580186800.0,"my original post was definitely very charged up while talking about the USS liberty, an event very few people seem to remember or even know about.  personally i grew up in an Irish Catholic home in a small town with a big family and never once saw or was a party of any type of antisemitism until i traveled to NYC for college.  my time in NYC, i was submersed within many cultures and that really allowed me to learn about and appreciate the plethora of different backgrounds my classmates came from.   once i (with some friends that were locals) went to Brooklyn and i had my first interactions with some very nice (and very patient) older Hasidic Jewish gentlemen.  They allowed me to ask them some questions and then they answered as best they could."
nba,ffsk469,t3_euza18,1580183673.0,i felt that!  the emotional ripple effect of Kobe and his daughter tragic death has had a ripple  effect that has completely covered the globe!  just a fan of the Celtic i am still trying to make sense of this tragedy!
nba,ffsf2dk,t3_euv6gt,1580180141.0,"i also have to believe that this foundation will absolutly help the other families that were personally affected by this tragedy.  i realize its very early-on, but so many wonderful tributes are already in place,  has there been any word on the other families situation/needs?  sorry if this has already been asked."

sports,ffse44l,t1_ffs3adg,1580179499.0,"His legacy was already timeless.  But because of this tragedy. He maybe remembered for centuries rather than decades. 

(Please don’t judge) but As I’ve tried to draw parallels, the best one I can come up with (and I realize the differences, but the suddenness and the societal impact seem to almost line up) is when Dale Earnhardt died.  Again I realize it’s not an “apples to apples” comparison.  Just where my mind went now that the initial shock has worn off."
conspiracy,ffsdbvq,t1_ffsbuix,1580178977.0,Me neither. But I am glad that I can at least understand the question. :-). Cheers M8
conspiracy,ffsbgfx,t1_ffsajfm,1580177739.0,"ok i understand and admire your beliefs.  unfortunately this world we live in is cold and there is a definite food chain and you shouldn't feel guilty about being born with the ability to reason and therefore at the top of said chain.

if you were a mouse you'd not have the mental capacity to even understand just how awful this world really is!  
so which is better/worse?"
husky,ffsazua,t1_ffs7kei,1580177434.0,"hey thanks, those darn dogs (like all huskies) know darn well how cute they are!  :-)  
so glad you asked, here goes....2 huskies is so much better than 1....but 3 or more is a REAL handful!  Huskies are such pack oriented animals and my two are so bonded to each other and still view me as the leader (except when i am forced to ""pooper-scoop"").....  get your husky a ""pack"" and you'll never not-love being their leader.   as far as bike/scooter  attachments i use a retractable line set up rather than a ""noodle""....i also use a scooter with lower tires....a mtn. bike like yours...use the noodle OR they make (which i have like 4 of that id gladly send ya) a devise that attaches to the seat pole.  so each dog runs on the side Vs. in front.  this didn't work for me as both dogs would rather be in front together rather than on opposite sides.  it was a ""trial and error"" period!  lol"
todayilearned,ffsa8e4,t1_ffs8uy3,1580176922.0,"so did you address the attack on the USS Liberty and what their intention was in doing so or do you just want to rant?  i try to hate no-one and i should not have painted Israel with those words....i apologize for that.   Compared to its neighbors, Israel is certainly our best/strongest ally in the region but also should not be above criticism."

conspiracy,ffrmtwq,t1_ffrkwqk,1580161306.0,"ok, your position is admirable but laughable at the same time.  how do you feel about fishing?  or swatting a fly?   and if history has taught me anything its that the ruling class (ie. advanced civilization) will never care about how the people being ruled care to be treated!  YMMV"

todayilearned,ffrew2z,t1_ffqq8yb,1580156683.0,or look at how they attacked the USS Liberty in '67.  Israel doesnt give a fuck about the loss of life as long as they have their god on their side.
