Demonstrating your ignorance once more. So we have established that those towards top in OECD are strongly left leaning. Once established, if a country moves higher in public spending than those at the top, it’s a strong indication that the country is also strongly left leaning (unless one is a dishonest fu-ck). 

**So you’re argument is that spending is basically 100% unrelated. Yet, among OECD it holds really well. There are no island nations so they are not important to the discussion of OECD. If spending is a strong indicator among the OECD, and the top spenders in the OECD are for certain strong left countries on a global scale of 200 countries, than a country moving to the top of spending would be strong left country.

2. If so, then stating “ I was talking on the global scale, and there are countries that are further left than the Nordic countries” adds nothing of value and is just being dishonest here trying to suggest many many nations are further left. In the other post, you basically only named Cuba that was to the left of these OECD left countries and arguably Venezuela. Seems like if there are 200 countries in the world and only 2 are to the left, then Nordic countries plus France plus Greece are strongly to the left globally. 
3. So you admit Nordic countries are strongly left. I demonstrated that Bernies policies would make the US government a far bigger share of the economy than Nordic countries and other strongly left countries like France and Greece.

Also:

- In September and October, the electoral tribunal banned news media from publishing two Jubileo polls that showed the difference between Mesa and Morales was narrowing and also below the crucial, 10-point margin. The tribunal said that Jubileo had used funding from international organizations to conduct its survey, going against Bolivian law. But it allowed newspapers to publish polls by other companies that used international financing. Those polls gave Morales better results.

- Raúl Peñaranda, the director of local news site Brujula Digital, says that while Bolivians still enjoy rights like the freedom of assembly and the right to protest, the country’s democracy is becoming increasingly limited.

- A key factor, he says, are constitutional changes introduced by Morales early in his tenure, which gives congress the power to nominate judges for key positions. Morales has held large majorities in congress since he first became president 13 years ago, and that has enabled him to stack the country’s most important courts with magistrates that support his cause, Peñaranda explains. This includes the constitutional court that greenlighted his run for a fourth term in office."

She's close enough for him to hear since he heard the 2nd time.  She also is in front of the camera so she wants to keep talking in a normal voice.

cringe,fevq0zu,t1_feu855n,1579400095.0,"So the comment you are referring to is:

- Bernie said he had no idea what the fuck she's talking about, it'd be nice if she at least clarified or did literally anything but accuse him of sexism after years of being buddie

How the hell does that address anything I've said or asked?

This is NOT related to the question I asked.  I'm not asking about Bernie, I'm asking about Warren.  You made a real ignorant argument here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/epstir/elizabeth_warren_tried_to_call_out_bernie_sanders/fem3ye2/?context=3

- I think it's interesting how she said ""I think you called me a liar on national tv?"" twice with the exact same tone on every syllable. If someone goes ""What?"" you don't repeat yourself the exact same way, you try to make yourself more audible, avoid slurring or whatever and speak carefully. The fact she said it twice the exact same way tells me she probably rehearsed how she'd say it over and over in her head, deciding which comes off the most direct and professional and cool or whatever.

You're supporting the argument that Warren was lying because she repeated a question without any major change in tone, volume or words. WTF kind of dumb argument is that?  

So if WARREN needed to to change her tone for Bernie to hear, than why did Bernie hear the 2nd time? It seems clear that a change in volume or tone wasn't needed. It's also VERY clear to anyone that isn't a CTH idiot that Warren knows the cameras are on them so she's trying to remain calm

>This genuinely doesn't matter & I really don't care about this discussion


It doesn't matter....that one of the arguments being made to say she is a liar is some ignorant argument about how she didn't change her tone, volume or words? That's the whole point...that you people are making really stupid argument to attack Warren."
neoliberal,fevmk3e,t1_fesb02k,1579399129.0,"> Again my argument is pretty explicitly that the reason that people believe this, and it's honestly in large parts true in the modern day, is because non Vanguardist socialists were intellectually destroyed/decimated by Mao Zedong thought and Marxism-Leninism, because they succeeded/won.

Mao was 50 years ago. I understand that is 'modern' but what about in 2020?


I agree...looking at the history I understand why people supported. But in the post USSR world, why do people continue to support it?"

Not inherently socialism. You are engaging in the same practices the leftist do on reddit. They blame every 'greed' on capitalism (even if it was BEFORE socialism) and they credit any non profit related good thing to 'socialism'"

1. Why is that communist countries always have restrictions on freedoms? Why aren't people allowed to move out? 
2. Why does the state control the media? 
3. Why do they often kill large numbers in prison or slavery? 
4. Why don't people want to immigrate INTO these countries?

Seems like Warren thought it was perfectly suitable noise level that could be heard. But yeah, she should have shouted it (so it's all over the news) or she should have said it more angrily (so we can all see it all over the new)!"
