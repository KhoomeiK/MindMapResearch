After the snap, you realize what you did and feel bad for it. Or at least this was my case. It might just be all the pent up emotion or other reasons. It sucks, nonetheless."
depression,fdtrsvw,t3_emxllc,1578721199.0,"It seems that you had to go through a lot. It must have been very hard for you and even though you say that you're an awful person, and i'm not 100% sure that's the case, there is always room for improvement. And wanting help is the first step in getting better. I've got no advice to give, for now, only my wishes for you to get better. I hope that everything will get better for you. If you want to talk with someone, you can hit me up."
