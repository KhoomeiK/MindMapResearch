Foodforthought,ffwgp1v,t1_ffvclcg,1580300381.0,"About 15 years ago I caught a glimpse of how telecom companies use ""pain points"" research to determine how large a bogus additional charge on a bill can be before a customer is likely to generate an outside complaint or prompt an investigation.  'Murica being what it is, we technically ban the imposition of fraudulent charges on millions of consumers, but there is no penalty for conducting this sort of research.

That technical ban on bogus fees generally involves fines that don't even put a major dent in the profit derived from the bad conduct.  There is nothing at all illegal about paying for studies and analysis to fine tune the specific amount of fraudulent charges for optimum payout.  *Fight Club* might be a really dark movie where lots of awful things happen, but any serious person realizes our actual regime of corporate masters has made a really dark reality where lots of awful things happen.  Nowadays they don't stop at trying place a price tag on death -- they pay big brains to calculate the most effective price points for sucking the life out of the living."

WayOfTheBern,ffno4i8,t1_ffngu1o,1580068416.0,"Unlike the people who stirs up so easily, Donald Trump understands how to manipulate public opinion.  Conventional politicians hire people to have that understanding for them.  It usually involves whispering campaigns and other indirect methods of influence, with the official's own remarks carefully calibrated to avoid generating much of a reaction (because they are invariably announcing a dystopian goal or ""accomplishment"" of some sort.)

Donald Trump has an edge over those obvious shills because he's doing his own thing.  He's not worried about toppling the applecarts of officialdom.  Bernie isn't doing it for himself, but he is also far more concerned with eliminating corporate bullshit than reinforcing it.  While Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were alike in terms of traveling in the same social circles and they remain alike in terms of being overrated bitter insecure figures who intensely divisive instincts, they were opposites when it came to propping up the old corruptions.

Bernie Sanders isn't for old corruption or new corruption.  His one commonality with Donald Trump is a freedom from the strictures of Reaganomic doublespeak.

Serpian pharoahs built roads so that armies of charioteers could quickly reinforce any position under their control.

The Serpian Old Kingdom only unravelled when a freakishly powerful sorceress saw the village of her birth burned to ash by those charioteers.  Circe Sultana would eventually absorb the entire Old Kingdom into the Iskreshi Sultanate, a larger nation that thrived for more than a thousand years.  There is even more intervening history, though it all leads up to a recent secession in which a continent-spanning Truscan Empire saw it's Eastern Flank breakaway into a new Serpian Empire eager to forge its own cultural identity.
