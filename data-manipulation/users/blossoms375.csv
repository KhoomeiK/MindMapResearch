However, I’ve had my reservations which is the reason that I haven’t met him yet, despite his repeated suggestions. Probably because I am still afraid that his old ways will be repeated. Also, I am giving myself time to be completely independent in every way. But with his birthday and on hearing his voice, i have been thrown into a whirlwind of emotions.

Now that I think of it, I was happy but not only that; it was a whole roller coaster of emotions. I have also been very sad and very anxious with him. I did learn a lot from him. Relationships aside, he is one of the few people I have met who have their life together, which is what was most inspiring for me."
relationship_advice,ffbdxpi,t1_ffbbrrt,1579761207.0,"It was actually his fault. Without going into details, there were other girls and lies. But, he maintains that they were only friends. However, I had my doubts, and at that time it was difficult for me to continue the relationship as he was way too close to them and our fights were getting out of hand, there were long periods of silence and a lot of mistrust was developing. 

I had tried for 6 months to make it work, but it was taking a toll on my mental and physical health and my career, so I had to let go of him to take care of my self and get my life on track. 

I want to try again because I was truly happy with him. He really made me so happy. And the love he gave me, I haven’t found it anywhere else."
nevillegoddardsp,fdmoljw,t1_fdlopp6,1578558210.0,Yes I’m gonna focus on my manifestations. Thank you so much for helping out! :)
nevillegoddardsp,fdldvds,t1_fdl580k,1578521918.0,"Thank you for these tips. I already do them, but not in a timely fashion, so perhaps that’s why they are ineffective. So I’ll focus on your suggestion to do these AS SOON AS I feel the negativity coming. I know it sounds silly and repeating the old story is something I had outgrown in these past few months. And the effect is visible- he’s back. But I don’t know how it got so bad today. I just couldn’t cope. When nothing at all worked, that’s when I turned to this sub. I have considered seeing a therapist, but there are some constraints presently, I will definitely do it if I can’t get hold of this in the future."
NoFap,fdjt71j,t1_fdi5ctt,1578486632.0,"Might i add to this, write on top of the sheet - “progress, not perfection” and it will really help you overlook the missed days and focus on the days on which you achieve. 

While “don’t break the chain” is usually the goal, what you have here is amazing and inspiring as long as you remember to focus on your achievements. So maybe this month won’t consist of completely filled boxes, but if you focus on the progress part of it instead of perfection, you might have all completed boxes within the next few months. All the best !!"

selfimprovement,fd2m2jd,t1_fcg7kep,1578149158.0,"I don’t know from where you drew the conclusion that I am a good looking privileged white male.. because I am neither white, nor a male. I have experienced discrimination as well, but what’s my responsibility is how I react to it. And I refuse to let it keep me down. I did let it occupy space in my head for 2 years, but no more. Enough time wasted. I forgive myself for letting discrimination waste my time. I will do whatever it takes to better myself and get what I deserve."
selfimprovement,fd2laan,t1_fcca98w,1578148831.0,Exactly!
selfimprovement,fd2l7c5,t1_fcd9zij,1578148798.0,You too !
Advice,fbr02hy,t1_fbjc752,1577037534.0,"You make some really good points, but none of them is something I haven’t tried already. Everything you said I have done and yet I am at this point. So it’s not self defeating. It’s a fact. I took to reddit only when I didn’t see any other option."
