Yet instead of letting that happen she was fired by Trump.  
  
I know you are already sticking your fingers in your ears and gearing up to reply that Trump is playing 6d chess by firing the people who were investigating Burisma before they could find anything and instead went ahead with pushing a purely hollow investigation via the president of Ukraine which was by design not going to uncover any new information, but be visually damaging to Joe Biden.
