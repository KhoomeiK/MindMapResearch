supergirlTV,ff4t759,t3_ermu5m,1579571862.0,I think the one episode we get so far was very enjoyable and like the fact that we get to see all 3 Luthors working together. I think that we need more episodes to really make an actual optimism but so far it’s fine.
supergirlTV,fevkag1,t3_eqo1ir,1579398385.0,Katie McGrath can have chemistry with a house plant. So I can see why people ship it. I’m just wondering how they would insert it into the story or if they should even do it in the first place.

Christianity,fcw4pdm,t3_ej7y0c,1578017089.0,"Because it’s shoved down the throats of some people causing them to despise it. I think one has to really explore themselves and decide on their own if they want to be a Christian. Plus some Churches are a bit extreme and push people away. Like my friend was forced to go to church and be a Christian, and she despised it. Put once she got older and when she moved out she gave Christianity another chance, and actually became a Christian because this time it’s her choice.(Not sure if you understood the story I’m bad with words)"

In season 1 she had to ask James what he was like, so that means that she really didn’t know him that well and that barley or never visited her at all."
