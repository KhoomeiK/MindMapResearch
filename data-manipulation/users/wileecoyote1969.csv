AbandonedPorn,ffphd7h,t3_eu9kkg,1580095070.0,"Not exactly abandoned; unused is a closer description. A lot of the older GP8, GP10, GP15 and SW 1500's it is becoming really hard to find specific parts for. Companies don't want to let go of them because nobody really makes a 4 axle switcher type engine anymore which are really handy in yards with sharp turns on tracks (larger 6 axle locomotives will just derail if a track curve is too sharp)

[Here is the history on this locomotive](http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/locoPicture.aspx?id=31538)

The typical fate for a locomotive sitting in the yard like this is that it will either go to auction where it will be bought up to be retrofitted or it will be simply sold as scrap metal and cut up"

Gloves allowed matches to go on longer but had the side effect of increasing the average amount and severity of blows to the head

Which is definitely not this case, unless she works at the bank with her tits out or no pants/skirt on. Cleavage does not count as illegal. A good rule of thumb is that if you can't get arrested for showing it in general public (i.e. not nude beaches), they can't get arrested taking pictures of it
