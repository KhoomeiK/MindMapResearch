ATBGE,ff64btg,t3_ermh7m,1579618797.0,Saw this on another subreddit but you posted it before I could; it’s gorgeous but also you just got a giant vibrator on your arm which IMO is not much different than getting a giant dildo on your arm.
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fe9lzbp,t1_fe8v181,1578939326.0,"I went to a theatre while vacationing in London that actually had three women’s restrooms and only one men’s restroom. It seemed to work out pretty well, actually, considering the time for an intermission in the middle of a musical is limited."

bulletjournal,fd6e8qe,t1_fd6dn3b,1578189635.0,Do it! r/crossstitch has a bunch of people posting the patterns they do and it’s really inspiring. Would recommend 100%
bulletjournal,fd6e3o7,t1_fd65y3w,1578189576.0,Super fun! Do you follow r/crossstitch? The people over there post so many fun patterns
bulletjournal,fd4jb0h,t1_fd3vzg0,1578168003.0,"Super simple to learn, actually!! I learned over Christmas break, just go down to your local hobby store and grab a kit and watch a YouTube video. Believe in you!"
TooAfraidToAsk,fcxxp0k,t1_fcxveeu,1578071962.0,"There you go! I also believe you shouldn’t beat yourself up for time wasted. If you feel relaxed and you enjoy the time you spend doing nothing, then you’re not wasting it."
TooAfraidToAsk,fcxp9xk,t3_ej81rs,1578068280.0,"Yes! On break from college right now; I usually look back  and see all the time I’ve wasted, all the things I could’ve been doing. 

I think there’s a difference though between being bored and needing to relax. Someone else in this comment thread said that when you get older, you need that time to stay sane, which I feel like is true. If you feel bored with that time though, and the things you do to relax (like playing video games or just chilling on Reddit), then those are the times that I would say you should try and push yourself to do things. 

I think it helps if before break, you make a list of the things you *want* to do, and then maybe try to cross one thing off your list per day? Or work on one thing per day. That way you don’t feel like it’s wasted."
