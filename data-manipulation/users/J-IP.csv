Why worry at all is my question? Until we know more there is no need to be scared or promote fear and even so what do you gain? Perhaps try to avoid sneezing on people if you have a cold and take some basic precautions and then let the dice fall where they fall.

ADHD_Programmers,ffbowva,t3_esqzn7,1579776369.0,"Might help, one thing it's easy to do is to grasp a concept but not truly understand it and then how to use it.   


You see something and understand and know that you can use it in this way, combine it what that and then I will be able to do this. simple.  


But there are a bunch of hidden small steps in there. And when you come upon those you loose track of the bigger picture or have to jump around and reference a bunch of information in a distracting manner.

&#x200B;

So what you do is you learn to take things slow. Digest that blog post tutorial. Go through every step. Carefully. It might take 20-30 minutes instead of 10 minutes but all in all the entire thing will take 40minutes total compared to those 10 + 2hours of frustration.

That way you will retain more and more of all the little minutas that ultimately help you quickly puzzle together things and finally have your work be closer to the speed of your mind.

&#x200B;

It's that perseverance to keep a steady pace for long enough. Medication helps but isn't a cure. You have behaviours grained in deep and that takes dedication to change. Medication can be the tool that allows you to start doing it but without the mental effort it's not a certainty.   


So my threshold to start has been lowered, sometimes I can even shrug and go heck lets just try to start and manage to get going and I can keep focus for longer or switch back easier. But it is a long road.

Japan? I would worry about natural disasters but not because of the risk towards the plant.
China? Yeah, there would be plenty of other stuff I would worry about before the power stations.
Same goes for India, Russia or any ex Soviet States.

&#x200B;

It depends. Will it help you? I can't say that. But there is a high probability it can. If you don't have it then it can help you focus on other things. If you do it can help you understand.

I'd say that the age doesn't matter. Still younger then I was when I was diagnosed. And my diagnosis had even helped my father that's close to retiring. We are so alike that I can say with a 100% certainty that he has it since I do. So the same sort of realisations I've had has also helped him.

There is a downside. I sought aid because I'm oriented to fixing problems and had som stuff I just couldn't overcome. Realising that parts of these aren't really changeable was hard. I think it can be harder still with the wrong mindset. So while there are things I can't change I can change how I look at them. It also means I can relax and prioritise when to try and fit in and when to relax and just be me. 

So overall I think knowing your issues is good even if you can't fix them you can work on finding a way to relate them and potentially reduce stressfactors that interfere with the other things.

Since you are already diagnosed with PTSD, depression, gad you should already have some sort of contacts with doctors focused towards the mental or mental health professionals which should be the way to go.

I'd turn towards those resources that has helped with these other issues and straight up put it on the table. If you have aspergers there is a high probability that there are factors that causes those others. I'm ok socially. But if I get pressed or stressed or enough routine gets smashed I can act fairly close to someone with GAD.

So if those other Issues are something you wish to work on fixing/reducing I'd say it's a quite good idea to either confirm or rule out things like aspergers."
Mechwarrior5,ff94baf,t1_ff9383i,1579704514.0,"Instead of accepting either a multi mission contract or single mission contract you just accept a contract with a stated goal.

Now it might be an extremely dangerous contract or a multi mission one. Doesn't really matter. There is a goal however. Take a raid mission. Get in, destroy, get out.

Why not be able to do a intel gathering mission? (Say button that ""plans"" one and takes 2 days. Generate suitable mission. Perhaps an extraction of a person that knows something or a sneaky type mission. Anyway you have more intel. You get more details on what you are facing, type of weapons or positioning etc.

Perhaps you decide it's too hard so you plan another mission. Either a distraction mission (that then reduces the difficulty on the other but those mechs and pilots might not be available for the main event) Or you run an ambush where you take out some of the defenders.

This way we might spend more on dropcosts but take less damage but it gives us more freedom to then run it how we want.

&#x200B;

Exactly how much and how good you can make this depends a lot on how it's currently is done and how accessible all the different parts are to mod. Haven't had the time to sit down and look through it all yet so I don't know if even a fraction of what I want is possible."

Combine that with the dark and big urban maps and you got a deal! Locust comes around corner, runs in to Atlas. Looks up. Atlas looks down. High beams. (followed by laserbeams and ac 20 ofc)

Would love heat mode or other vision modes.

For the map I would want news updates, local gossip and that sort of thing. If I'm in the FedSuns I want news snippets and local chatter about the Capellans or Draconis.

If I'm at a border world I want like snippets from what the people think or similar. Immersion!

But Intel is high on the list. I think this is something that could be expanded greatly. There are many ways to give you Intel. Detailed. 3 atlases 35 light vehicles and 1 urabnmech. Or less detailed. But why not then give you different ways of improving your Intel? Or change up your mission?

If I'm doing a raid mission why not have several missions potentially available? But not as in the linked one but rather as optionals or even where you are able to plan them yourself a bit. Do some scout missions, or light raiding missions etc. I think this is something that could be leveraged in to turning the conflict zones in to more than just the area where you take contracts but make it feel as small campaigns rather but also give you further flexibility to play them as you'd like. 

You could drop your assaults and go pure assault style or do a recon run, perhaps an ambush, probing attack etc if you want to run mostly lighter mechs."

But from an investor pov even if the profitability is low it can still be worth it if it's not risky. The thing is public opinion, policy changes and those sort of factors kinda removes the stability factor.

You would need guarantees and safeguards for the investors then to push it through and it just takes a lot of political will and capital.

news,ff8u6su,t1_ff8rh7b,1579696217.0,"Yup. Lets look at Tesla. First off, they have publicly stated bold plans in the past and despite all the critique kinda followed through. So we can look at that and their future plans and have a good picture of what they are planning to do.

Now we look at things like brand. They have made EVs to status. EV == Tesla in a lot of cases. It's incredibly strong by now. But they are constantly innovating. Not just in the car but the manufacturing, in the business model etc so all that goes in to their evaluation.

Then add in factors like just what is happening in the world.  Will climate change just stop in the coming 30 years? Will awareness go down? Or is it quite likely that it's going to remain an important topic and struggle for the entire 21st century?

So far there are quite a bit that points to their continued growth. But there is even more relating to their business model.

Big problem with the entire climate change issue is overconsumption. Cars are just standing around not doing anything most of the time. We could have a lot less cars if they could drive around and keep busy when not in use. Tesla is planning for this, quite openly. Add in all their self driving etc etc.

Image then the pull of a car that becomes an investment for the owner? Honestly for the value of their products it seems that car companies are kinda undervalued but stocks represent what investors believe the company can earn. So if you look at the assets of automobile industry and imagine a business model where a larger portion of that was profit? Kinda why I think Tesla is rising. In a few years it will show if this pans out.

This amount of bottles makes me think they were out celebrating last night and if so putting all the bottles neatly like that is quite admirable considering how people can be while drinking.

Kinda the only logical solution I can come up with unless people in France drink red wine in a fashion similar to how other might pop in to a 7/11 to get some water."

aspergers,fdqknso,t3_emrvib,1578668972.0,"I can only share my experience but I'm the same as you. I kinda need a goal when doing stuff. Hanging out becomes harder then, during social gatherings I'll be quite quiet unless there is a specific discussion where I can engage. 

&#x200B;

My observations from how people seem to be able to just hang out and bond is that they chit chat and small talk in a way that I just can't. They remember stuff about others and their relationship with others and generally seem to have an intuitive way of then generating small talk. I can ask things I've learned to ask about and share when asked but I tend to forget and be unable how to use this information the next time.

&#x200B;

I strongly believe that a lot of people seem to have like a graph network built in to them when it comes to other people. They can add new nodes to the graph and discover new edges and seem to have a natural tendency to explore this and remember information pertaining to a node. I kinda lack these edges and the ability to connect information to the nodes is limited. Especially when it's about people I've met once or only heard about. 

&#x200B;

So when people hangout they almost automatically sync their ""graphs"" as well as generate topics around new nodes etc. This way they bond and share that. The more I observe people the more I'm convinced that this is a quite good analogy and a lot of people have this behaviour seemingly built in as a primary working mode.

&#x200B;

I think there are a lot of NTs that struggle with this also but primarily with people having different psychology but ASD's probably showcase this much stronger because we display traits where some of the mechanisms that are required to work are severely different or non existant compared to a NT person that's had a band hand with stuff like depression bully etc. Their mode becomes wrongly configured for further normal operation (kinda a bit why a bullied person can move and be in a completely different setting yet end up the same) and thously struggle with it but we have more of a tendency to struggle because we are either operating on a completely different model or have dependencies completely missing."

You will have people irritating and making you angry when you drive and my tip is this:

&#x200B;

Instead of anger train yourself to be disappointed in people. Much much easier to let go and not get hanged up on and keep driving that way. It's not their fault, they just can't help it because they are stupid etc. Just pity them and move on with your life. :)"
Amd,fdjp4x8,t1_fdjdas3,1578481783.0,"Well with what they priced the 5700xt at they have a lot of room to work with when it comes to pricing. Current high end rtx could either mean super -> ti levels or ti -> titan rtx levels.

Like you said if they sort those issues they might have a lot of room where they can make a popular card that makes them a lot of money while providing good value.

I think the key here is to know more about Nvidias next gen in order to find the correct price point for them so I think it's a bit of a chicken race currently about how goes out with more details first and AMD is doing the right thing to be patient."
Amd,fdjooe7,t3_elialw,1578481156.0,"A few factors which I believe play in to why they have been so quiet about big navi.

They don't want to be first with the next high end stuff. They want to be able to counter Nvidia and not have Nvidia say they will do X 3 hours later and being countered.

Fine tuning, when it gets released it will be a high profile card with lot of interest me thinks so they don't want any unnecessary hickups probably. AMD has a reputation when it comes to drivers and if they do aim to compete they have to wash away this.

Production capacity perhaps? Not super in the know when it comes to those parts of the silicon business but perhaps TSMC is a bit booked up?

I'm going to guess it's mostly related to the first two factors."

IsaacArthur,fdgqjud,t3_elbqv4,1578405701.0,"I don't think it's going to be as much being driven but rather just happen. When we eventually start getting O'Neil cylinders and live on other bodies and have population that's on order of magnitudes greater than we have now I think it will be a combination of not having a need to go back combined with potentially astronomical costs.

&#x200B;

Imagine our current hordes of turists but a 100x or 1000x times as large? It's just not feasible that everyone visits, let alone on the regular. So in that regard you will soon have loads of people who never visited earth. It could be an economical/class question or something entirely different. There will be those who are jealous of those who can potentially as well as those that will then reject earth entirely in order to protect themselves from that jealousy. 

&#x200B;

But at the same time at this stage the population would be so huge as well as the industrial output up in space that there most likely will be those who are contemplating going to other stars if exploration hasn't been done yet. But unless we can overcome some of the hurdles that's regular been discussed when it comes to interstellar travel it's not exactly like taking a boat and probably would remain a large undertaking. 

&#x200B;

Expending that much in order to just expel people isn't feasible I think. Considering human history there is a much grimmer but more plausible way of things going in that regard. So most likely it will be explorers or people with that adventurous mindset that sets off me thinks and i don't think they would remain entirely cut off. Snail mail would still be used in the way of waiting for signals."

svenskpolitik,fbg9f7g,t3_ed81ko,1576841124.0,"Detta borde väll bara vara ett problem om det är så att privat konkurrera mot det allmänna. Nu är det ju inte direkt en artikel som undersökt frågan utan en insändare med påståenden. Stämmer dessa så ja problematiskt. Men att klaga på det privata är fel utan det är ju i så fall stat/landsting som fuckat up. Om dom inte driver i egen regi och förlitar sig på privata aktörer så måste dom ju förhandla så att dom lever upp till sina åtaganden. Men samtidigt så är det givet att när folk inte får det dom behöver att dom söker alternativ.

Jag hade fortfarande väntat nu i snart 6 månader i kö om jag inte gått till privat. Kostade mig ca 8000kr men det bemötande och hjälp jag fått har varit guld och jag skulle kunna gått upp till det tio dubbla. Lågt räknat så har det nu lösta problemet kostat mig över en årslön. Lågt räknat. Detta utan korrigering för ränta och dylikt. Detta utan att vara någon höginkomsttagare.

För en stor del av samhället så blir detta en enkel kalkyl. Personal är dyrt, att hålla dom friska eller att kapa tiden dom är borta är värt enormt mycket och då blir det tunga krafter som söker detta och även de som kommer försöka tillgodo se detta. Men detta är int enbart av ondo eftersom det blir mindre sjukdagar och högre produktivitet.

Så det är för att det finns ett behov och är detta ett problem så skall man lägga skulden på hur det öppnats inte att det har. Dessa intressen som gör detta har ju även medlen att i så fall vända sig utomlands och hanteras det inte korrekt skulle det kunna slå hårt mot ett land som redan har problem med konkurrenskraft pga skatter.

Täppa till de luckor som låtit miljardvis betalats ut fel de senaste tio åren och minska onödiga utgifter i landet skulle ju vara något att börja med."
