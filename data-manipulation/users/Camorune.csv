I'm one of these people, I truly have very few interest, let alone any that wouldn't bore the person to death. When it comes to things outside of those, such as food, aside from a few occasions when something strikes me, I do not care what I eat. A potato with nothing on it is just as good as a restaurants meal (and when factoring in cost, much better)."

Click the filter button then click live. Also if someone is streaming with a moderate amount of people watching it will be one of the first things recommended

 >It’s also hard to be a smaller streamer on YouTube because you simply will never be found

This is completely false. YouTube you will have much larger audience, I guarantee it. Everyone that I know that has streamed on both that isn't a major streamer, including myself, sees a much higher rate of people visiting the stream and much more importantly interacting, in an hour on twitch you will see no one on the majority of days. On YouTube you will see at least 2 or 3 people sometimes you will hit up to 10."
