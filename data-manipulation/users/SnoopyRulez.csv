aww,fef8imk,t1_fee4tsh,1579050698.0,I was also adopted. There was never a time that I didn’t know.  My mom and dad raised me with the knowledge that my birth parents did what was best for me and in that taught me parental love.  Love so strong that my birth parents were willing to give me up so I could have a better life.  My mom and dad always told me that if I wanted to look for my birth parents they would support me.  As an adopted child I would strongly suggest to follow what my parents did.  Always let your child know you adopted him.  It’s the most pain free way of raising your child.
