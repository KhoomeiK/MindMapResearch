Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ff909kc,t3_esc2rv,1579701536.0,"Congrats on 1 yr in here! I am still really new to this sub. Everyone in here is so incredibly friendly, and I love how you all lift each other up and spread positive vibes. Wish I could spend more time posting/commenting/getting to know everyone in here better, but being a med student...I have very little free time. Actually, I am struggling to stay awake in a neuroanatomy lecture right now. 😴😴  

I am going to guess that you got an ""A"" on your latest biochem test🧪. Am I right? 😉"
cats,ff6qclb,t1_ff5yig0,1579632677.0,I am sure they will be. Thank you.

cats,ff4td0o,t3_ernmx4,1579571973.0,Sorry for your loss. Fred looks like he was a sweetie. My cat Max will soon be joining him across that great rainbow bridge in the sky. 🌈
cats,ff3v1bk,t3_eria42,1579549464.0,This is the best thing I've seen in a long time. I'm dying...😂😂😂😂😂
AmItheAsshole,ff3lg5x,t3_erg7sp,1579543560.0,"NTA. You need to bring this to the attention of a supervisor.  Friendship aside, if she is failing at the job, providing misinformation, and violating HIPPA she needs to find another job. As a medical professional, I have zero tolerance for HIPPA violations and/or incompetence, and neither does your employer or the federal government."
marilyn_manson,ff31p4l,t1_ff1tbj8,1579531346.0,"I was mostly joking. Clearly, I do not know if he actually hates bright yellow Corvettes. I was referring to a story he told on Marc Maron's WTF podcast about his dad driving cross country from OH to CA to visit him in a brand new yellow Corvette. He was making fun of him for it saying, ""Dad, you look like a dickhead [in that car]..."". It was pretty funny. He said it was the kind of car that made him want to fight the person driving it, and that he made his dad put a car cover over it so no one would see it outside his house. That podcast episode is one of my favorite interviews with him. I adore him."

cats,fempgr7,t1_femly0o,1579265686.0,"My sincerest condolences on the passing of Whispers.  Losing a beloved feline companion is never easy. I brought my cat Max (10yrs old) home, yesterday, on comfort measures after a week long stay in the vet hospital. I want him to be able to pass peacefully at home surrounded by love. Perhaps, when Max's time comes, he will meet and become friends with Whispers on that great rainbow bridge in the sky. 🌈"
