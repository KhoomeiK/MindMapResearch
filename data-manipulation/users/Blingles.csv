cats,ff9cjxi,t1_ff8qred,1579709926.0,"My mom has the urns for Fred and his brother and adopted sister now; I see them as her babies first and foremost so it's only right. On my end, I'm having pictures commissioned of each cat portraying a medieval fantasy class/stereotype (for our 2nd anniversary of dating my husband had one of the cats still with us done as a knight). My husband once questioned the logic behind me getting them all done in such a manner. After seeing this, he doesn't now.

I have two gatos of my own at home, I swear one of them is Fred's brother reincarnated. One day I know I'll find one like Fred himself. He can never be replaced, but he knows there is always room in my heart for more!"
