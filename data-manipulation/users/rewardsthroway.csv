espresso,fdhh4dt,t1_fdhbd49,1578422526.0,I actually pop out the basket and plop on a magnetic dosing funnel (like $15 on amazon) and push the button with my finger to fill the basket. I like to weigh out everything and it's easier for me to do it that way over trying the balance a handled portafilter on a scale. A lot less messy that way for me.

espresso,fdgt1kt,t1_fdemnl7,1578407586.0,I have the Manuale - it's all metal and the chute in plastic. I went with that one because I used a scale anyways and didn't need the features of the timers or dosing control. Definitely a good grinder - I've just been waiting forever for Kafetek to have their monolith available for sale so I got that one in the interim. Had a niche zero and promptly sold that.

espresso,fcxpllo,t1_fcxm0gs,1578068481.0,"Makes sense - I guess it's all relative. We purposely moved to a small mountain town to continue making an LA income in a low income area to retire early. Every once in a while I'll work with other friends that do the same thing but prefer to knock out work a few hours, go on a run or hike, work a few more and call it a work day.

IAmA,fclwvp0,t1_fcluju7,1577758437.0,Sounds like you had an arterial dissection by what you're describing (SCAD). Given your age and weight it has to be a developmental fault. Fortunately they'll be able to hunt down the cause after more testing. Be well!
