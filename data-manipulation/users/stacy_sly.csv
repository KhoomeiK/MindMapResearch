antidepressants,ff25jcw,t3_er5m4z,1579494400.0,It usually takes about a week or two for side effects to go away with Bupropion. I had a headache and bad tummy for a while and then it stopped and I felt better.
depression,fe00evo,t3_en7336,1578800074.0,I get this. It’s easier to be “sick” sometimes. If you’re better you’re just like everyone else too. No different. It’s a sick way to feel - I mean who wants to feel awful - but I do get it.
depression,fccm5m6,t3_egw1u2,1577600010.0,Same here. I’ve virtually stopped listening to the music that once inspired me. I know it isn’t good. Your post made me remember that thanks.
depression,fccl5sa,t1_fcbqmy9,1577599665.0,Thank you for that reminder. I want to believe. I’m just so beaten down. I know you are right though. I’m trying to find it.
depression,fcck85s,t3_egu121,1577599349.0,Yes. All of this. I can’t add much else. Depression steals your life. Things that once brought you joy don’t matter anymore. I personally can barely function. I have this huge cloud hanging over me and I can’t see out of it. Not even little shimmers of light. When? When will it get better. Why do meds take so long to work? I’ve had to start over so many times with new meds that I think it’s the reason I’m nauseous half the time. My body doesn’t know what’s going on. Please just make it stop hurting so much. Please.
depression,fcblj5f,t3_cml6ni,1577588260.0,"I can’t remember ever feeling this bad. It’s like there’s this dark cloud hanging over me. That doesn’t even explain it - it’s much worse than that. You know when you have this weird feeling that something just isn’t right? It’s an overwhelming sadness that won’t go away. There’s no relief from it. It’s a constant feeling. 

I don’t know how I’m going to pull myself out of this depression either. Many months of med changes, nothing seems to be working. I’m having physical symptoms now too. My stomach is a wreck; food doesn’t taste good; I’ve lost about 7-8 pounds so far. 

I don’t know what else to say. I need some relief. Just some small “good” feeling - a few minutes even - to just let me know that it’s going to be ok. That I’ll get myself back. :("
bipolar,fcagy8a,t1_factuhm,1577569057.0,"You start trying stuff that’s in the yellow column, the “use with caution” meds. That’s what I’m doing now. I’m trying Wellbutrin and it’s in the yellow column for me."
depression,fca9ifs,t3_egqe95,1577565165.0,"I've become an introvert but today took the first step in changing that. I went to a workout class with my friends... Tried to just jump in and do it... Couldn't... Sat down on the floor and cried. Everyone was OK with it. They said ""hey, do what you need to do. We're here. Stand up and join in if you can. If not, you can sit here and cry if you want. We're here."" Wow. I have some really good friends. Just wow."
bipolar,fa96gj3,t3_e3csjx,1575863683.0,I’m on the same combo just having started lithium 2 weeks ago. Lamictal I’ve been on for years. I felt the same way - still do: “Shit just got real. I guess I really am bipolar.” So far I notice nothing. I’m still very depressed and now started having symptoms of panic. Does anyone know how long it takes for Lithium to kick in? The doc said something about blood tests letting you know if it’s at a therapeutic level. Maybe that’s when I’ll notice something. Meanwhile I still feel like shit.
