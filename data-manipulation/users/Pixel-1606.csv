Now this could be partly because of something like ADHD, but believe me that for efficiency's sake hardly anyone would closely inspect something given to us by someone we trust right away, that's why pranking anyone in such a matter is possible at all (even the smartest people can be fooled).

Now, giving someone someone unexpected to drink, or unscrewing the top of the salt shaker or something like that could be a fun prank. Handing someone actual poison pretending it's their much needed medicine, however, is plain evil. I don't know how old y'all are, but that's taking it way too far for a joke.

Second:

>Girls are privileged so they are allowed to act masculine, but boys aren't allowed to act feminine, so the flip always goes like that.

I'm sorry if you see the world like that, the whole view that caused this pattern (which like I explained isn't even present in this case) is underlied with the dominant view for most of history that men are better than women. Girls are not ""privileged"" in this choice, women had to fight/protest for equal rights and to be allowed to participate in society as equals (now that not all of our energy has to be drained by producing and taking care of often short-lived offspring due to poor medical understanding and living conditions) and adapting masculine fashion and other cultural aspects helps us function in equal roles (pants>skirts) or be taken a little more seriously by males.  
You are allowed to wear pink, hell, put on a dress and wear make-up if you want to, but most guys are afraid that expressing themselves as they choose might hurt their fragile image of masculinity. It's a problem created by and for men, you tend to call guys who do choose traditionally feminine toys, fashion or jobs names, but at least those ""sissies"" were man enough to make up their own damn mind and stand with their choice."

Modern signals (that are often adaptations of old ones in a modern context) are still being used in sexual selection: like an expensive watch telling you about someones wealth, a high number of followers on social media telling you about someones social skills, a uniform telling you about someones sense of responsibility.

You've learned how to drink from a cup without spilling at some point in your early childhood I hope? Just ditch them altogether and pretend you're older than 5, problem solved."
ADHD,feda4oz,t3_eojhal,1579005333.0,"I've had similar experiences with IF, I think there's some biological basis in feeling more motivated to do the things you're supposed to be doing on an empty stomach (almost all behavioral/inteligence test on animals are done after ""starving"" them for an appropriate amount of time for example), and that boost can seem more prominent in those that have motivational problems.  If you don't want to lose any weight it becomes a little more challenging to get everything you need in the smaller feeding window, but it should be doable (and at least you only have to plan one or two meals instead of 3-6 incl snacks)"

loseit,fed8lwx,t1_fed7gyp,1579003762.0,"there are often estimates for homemade stuff like broth too, though they'll probably won't be 100% acurate.  
I agree that I wouldn't keep doing this long term, but it doesn't hurt to keep a bit more of a strict account for a couple of weeks to sort of troubleshoot your cooking habits and get to know which elements can add up more quickly than you'd guess. I live in a student house so I get to eat a lot of meals that I've got no direct control over and I sure as hell aint gonna be the kind of person to bother housemates while they're cooking because not knowing the exact amount of oil they put in gives me anxiety or some shit. But I did measure my own meals for a bit and made estimates of theirs, now I have a pretty solid idea of the amount of calories I get out of such meals on average and I just go with that. A softer approach like that can work for most people (just keep an eye on the scale and adjust the estimations if the results don't add up), if you have pretty regular eating habits, eventually you can let the counting go al together"
