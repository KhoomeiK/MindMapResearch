Most of the times this question comes in the mid or end of an interview, so you have a basic understanding of No-Go's and less bad behavior. If for example it's an startup and it's already a quite messy place, you might want to say:  
""I'm a bit clumsy at times. With my yoga, however I got this quite in check.""

I once heard a ted talk from Cecillia McGough, she has primarily the hallucinogenic schizophrenic type.

Could you add this information that as CPTSD is as the name suggests is pretty complex and there are a lot better symptomatics to determine whether you have it or not. 
Also..as with all charts that could lead to self diagnosis: Please make a disclaimer that this won't replace a professional check-up. Desperate people paradoxically often search for diagnosises where they can't do a thing about it besides mitigation and such a chart is perfect for them."

If they seek out the help, they are in a totally different mindset.

productivity,ffclrt7,t3_esw3ch,1579802160.0,"Fun thing is, that I was searching on reddit to find a better solution.

For now I can recommend you zim-wiki or tiddlywiki.

zim-wiki is an awesome tool, as it allows you to manage files with it. As it has an attachment browser, tagging for task-lists, a journal function and much much more!

The only real downside are performance issues in big wikis and that it is not for now available on Android/IOS. The combination google drive + cryptomator + zim-wiki also solves the synchronization part.

Zim-wiki basically creates a folder structure with textfiles and optionally saves all the other files you save in it.

Define risky. It's a type thing with those psychedelics. I made once the bold hyptothesis, that I can't have a bad trip anymore (at least in moderate doses). This hypothesis holds since 1 whole year tripping. It may induce psychosis, but as I perceive mental illnesses it't more like a really nasty bad habit than a one way road. I made myself trust again by facing my broken trust until I was fed up and ""just"" changed it. Basically I made some psychological intended pitfalls, so that my BPD is tricked into actually helping my mental health, rather than destroying it. Only downside is if you lose hope, everything will turn against you and you will have a hard time on regaining your own trust.

It's a lot about training yourself to accept uncertainty. The biggest fear of a BPD. With this I ""cured"" my BPD.

Fun thing is, that I didn't knew that I had BPD until the point I almost got over it anyway.

tl;dr A mental illness is in my opinion not the final destination. A psychosis or BPD is merely a transformation state to self improvement, if treated correctly.

A crazy person who may act normal owns the world after all."
Borderline,ff14v1t,t3_eq2gcd,1579475201.0,"Narcissism is a trait which a borderliner may, or may not have. Think of a borderliner more of a guy who looks at the cabinet of mental disorders and wants its cut of every one of them. Schizophrenia, Bipolarity, Narcissism. Borderliner just can't say no. It's fun."
Borderline,ff12k4w,t3_eqtr1l,1579474604.0,"Most importantly, this is unfortunately normal with BPD. On the bright side there is hope. But it's a marathon, where you have to be prepared.

First off I am sorry to say, but you seem to be quite shaken up yourself. Try to refocus, consider therapy and meditation as this will help you focus and ""see"" ways out of this mess. Consider joining a self help group of BPD relatives. I know it is really, really hard, but with BPD it is essential, that you put your mental health before everything else. Offsprings of BPDs have a higher chance of developing BPD themselves when they grow older. You cannot help, when you are depressed after all.

To your mother applies the same: If she isn't yet in therapy she should definitely, as BPD is best treated in therapy, not medication. Make sure, that she can trust the therapist, as trust is essential in battling this sickness. She should also consider meditation or yoga, as this is proven to reduce the intensity of psychotic episodes.

If the medication has such strong side-effects, she should talk with her doctor. There is more than one medication for BPD. Please keep in mind that most BPDs are pathological liars as with their broken trust. Don't get me wrong.. we are not evil.. we are just.. complicated.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

You are not alone

&#x200B;

Just treat your mother as she is not going mad. Maybe explain, that this is only a mismatch in brain chemistry and with due training can be rearranged so it makes at least less damage for them or others.

Always remember the human behind the sickness, but try to separate it from your fears. Just do what you can, not what you expect of you to ""succeed"" to rescue your mother.

I have BPD myself and all I can say is that my friends should always put their mental health first, as if they are weak, my fear of rejection will find it and use it against them. Start a gratitude diary for example. An app like presently for android could help to remind yourself of the small things you are grateful for.

For the rest: Think of a borderliner as a big child. If you think ""child"" you can help fiddle out those weird, nasty self loathing, thoughts some may have.

All the best luck

Basically the same thought, but another viewpoint would be that every action is happening in the same moment and through the configuration of the energetic levels of the elements or mass placement one of the actions manifest in ""our"" reality.  One step further would be to think if you can do it the other way around. With thought changing reality itself. Naively thinking you already do it no questions asked.

MentalHealthSupport,fez4jcj,t1_fez1a21,1579453779.0,"Really nice that you checked beforehand.  I would really try to convince to check more with the psychosis. The psyche is a dirty place, normally they don't care about norms. The thing is, that you may identify a trigger which induces those psychotic episodes. Avoid if possible this trigger and with your therapist slowly confront those triggers. I wish you the very best. Feel free to message me, if you have any further questions and do tell when you get new intel on your state. What I liked to hear when I had those vivid panic attacks was: You are not going crazy, your mind is just working a bit different. The mind can adapt. You may not stop those visions, but you may change how you perceive those episodes. Consider Meditation and Yoga, as this will further calm your mind, helping you to find ways otherwise hidden.
