90dayfianceuncensored,ffa8k3o,t1_ff81cmx,1579729976.0,Do you think she actually follows the news?
90dayfianceuncensored,ffa88c4,t3_es3397,1579729794.0,Supposedly he does stand up. Has anyone seen his act?
90dayfianceuncensored,ffa833k,t1_ffa1e2q,1579729713.0,I did not know she has freckles!
90DayFiance,ff900gc,t3_es8fd6,1579701337.0,Perhaps she is realizing what a horrid person she really is.
90DayFiance,ff8zmtg,t1_ff7vrby,1579701036.0,"Nah, I liked it as well. What they are doing is very cool. I like Molly...never understood how she got tangled up with that jerk Luis."
90DayFiance,ff834m8,t1_ff6mw3t,1579664727.0,Thank you!
90DayFiance,ff8337g,t1_ff81dxb,1579664699.0,I find it rather sad. Assimilation has destroyed many a person. But I know what you mean. It is a trip.
90DayFiance,ff5ycrm,t1_ff4rtdt,1579614227.0,"Actually it does. The Hispanic community has a huge issue with colorism. Some identify as white hispanic, others have been denigrated for the darkness of their skin by being referred to by the N word. And it is not just them. You can see this around the world. There is actually a book with the same title that covers the history of it. Randall Kennedy is the author."
90DayFiance,ff5vt6g,t1_ff5mgq5,1579611955.0,Whoa! There is a podcast? That would be great for commuters! On it!
90DayFiance,ff55uj8,t1_ff50y4p,1579581082.0,There is an IG account called Frauded by TLC that posts pics etc.
90DayFiance,ff55oir,t1_ff4m7xi,1579580948.0,"I thought so as well and I think they do but I guess, depending on what filler it is that can take years. I found this interesting: https://youtu.be/szTI9R0x_xQ"

90DayFiance,ff49z13,t1_ff43g2o,1579558768.0,Thank you for sharing. I am getting to the age where the crease between my brows is beginning to form. Was thinking of Botox but ugh! Wonder how they will age...
90DayFiance,ff3u22f,t3_er9qc7,1579548854.0,So do they get paid extra if they break up or act villainous?
90DayFiance,ff3toxe,t1_ff3tl5o,1579548629.0,Thank you!
90DayFiance,ff3tod2,t1_ff3tfj2,1579548619.0,Thanks!
90DayFiance,ff3tns5,t1_ff3tf83,1579548609.0,Aaahhhh....thank you
90DayFiance,ff3stvm,t1_ff37eho,1579548096.0,"Agreed. Interestingly, I have just learned that some fillers can be dissolved and routinely are. Hope she considers this."
90DayFiance,ff3slgn,t1_ff37z8s,1579547954.0,I wonder how her sister came to America?
90DayFiance,ff347sb,t1_ff2idgy,1579533259.0,I don't understand why someone that young would think they need fillers.
90DayFiance,ff33oq1,t1_ff2sdx3,1579532873.0,Yep! That is my theory as well!
90dayfianceuncensored,ff2bfg5,t1_ff236uz,1579499608.0,I wonder if she had a nose job....
WhatsWrongWithYourCat,ff22g2j,t3_er077s,1579491986.0,Feed you cat! Through his little belly I am sure there is a rib...or something! Lol!
90DayFiance,ff22c52,t1_ff1zjr8,1579491903.0,So I wonder if she knows there is no prenup? I wonder if she is being nice and will somehow orchestrate their divorce. I wonder if she will help Julianne take all of Michael's money. I wonder if she will remind him he never should have divorced her in the first place. Just wondering what her end game is.
cats,ff21g6e,t3_er2jlw,1579491235.0,It's all for mmeeeeeee!!!!!

90dayfianceuncensored,ff215pz,t1_ff212oq,1579491021.0,You are so right!
90DayFiance,ff212u1,t1_ff1qi0p,1579490963.0,I dabble in reading and even I know this does not rule ones life. She is such a waste!
90DayFiance,ff20tr1,t1_ff1rzhx,1579490781.0,"She does not know what a soulmate is. People have many soulmates in their lives and can have multiple soulmates at a time. Your husband/wife, your sister, etc. soulmates are spirits manifested in living form that bond with you in a deeply loving and spiritual way.  Sounds like her previous relationship was karmic and she was supposed to learn some lesson which she clearly did not learn. She has completely forgotten about free will as it relates to astrology. Gosh I hope he leaves her!"
90dayfianceuncensored,ff205p6,t3_er6unr,1579490295.0,That would be great!
cats,ff1z3pw,t3_er5r7w,1579489531.0,He is handsome!

keto,ff0g6gw,t3_eqs354,1579468608.0,Well now you have done it! You have exposed me to a coffee that shares the same name as my cat..and it appears to be of quality AND they have a copped sweatshirt for sale????? Oh...but we are talking about keto right? Congratulations on kicking the sugar habit!

90dayfianceuncensored,fewbxn4,t1_ferx2v8,1579408133.0,She said that she got Botox injected there to remove the wrinkles
90dayfianceuncensored,few86wo,t1_fevu5kz,1579406764.0,I think so as well. I know a lot of people say he is a jerk but everyone can change. He seems to treat her well. I wonder if he is still teaching ESL?
90DayFiance,fesxz1k,t1_fesg62l,1579370074.0,Michael posted a short vid of Julianna trying to twerk at some point over the holiday. It was sad.
creepypasta,fesvxeu,t3_eqfqn6,1579369572.0,This looks as if it would have fit into the film Coraline very well. Love it!
aww,fepeoho,t3_eq4asy,1579318635.0,And I thought my cat was the only one who did that ðŸ˜¢
hummingbirds,fep9uvk,t3_eq913h,1579315387.0,I think I understand the drawing. What if you hung a feeder on the opposite side of the door or roofline? Or is this an overhang? Can you post a photo from the front?
mac,feoxeyf,t1_feowzxd,1579307472.0,He is standing right here....said thanks!
keto,feox1lm,t3_eq127s,1579307244.0,Very nice! I am not a big drinker but some days.....anyway...will try this!
mac,feowtyh,t1_feowmda,1579307113.0,Thank you so much. My grandson has been bugging me to let him install a large ssd for a few months now. I will let him do both of these.
mac,feowhxp,t1_feowdix,1579306908.0,It is the same model year as yours. So would you say the SSD upgrade is what made the cooling mod necessary?
mac,feow2v4,t3_eq8grq,1579306656.0,I love technology but am a user of and not a builder of. My question is this: if I have a stock version of this laptop what internal hardware should I replace to upgrade it to last another 5 years? Forgive me if the question is simplistic.
AskReddit,feobx80,t1_fen5xiy,1579297914.0,Same!
hummingbirds,feobs77,t1_fenln3j,1579297832.0,Wow! Thank you so much!
cats,feobnsu,t1_fens3fj,1579297784.0,Just subbed! Thanks! Watching the vid on building a cat shelter now. There is a stray that i feed daily. I would take him in if he would stay but he only comes into the vestibule to eat and then dashes.
cats,fen4izc,t1_femz87b,1579276798.0,What a lovely setting! I would love to have one but I am of an age where my kitty might outlive me and I would hate for her/him to have nowhere to go. If I ever come across a senior one though....heavy consideration! Do you have a youtube channel or IG account for them??????
90dayfianceuncensored,fen445u,t1_fen0blj,1579276542.0,Agreed
90dayfianceuncensored,femwa0h,t1_fej9cyr,1579271274.0,I tried one of these because I too am not the tallest person in the world and found them just as irritating. Some companies have come out with plastic slides you can attach to the seatbelt that moves the shoulder belt away from your neck but they impede the function of the belt. I have been looking into an aftermarket seat that has the feed hole for the shoulder belt positioned lower but that is a few thousand dollars and the seat is not very comfy. (I know your post was meant for someone else..just wanted to chime in if that ia ok)
90dayfianceuncensored,femvqmj,t1_fekae62,1579270881.0,According to the story she was involved in a religious cult and an arranged marriage was established with a 34 year old member of the same religious cult. She said he did not treat her kindly.
cats,femv318,t1_femr5a8,1579270393.0,Big boy! Do you have acreage or is he strictly indoors? Sorry if I am being too nosy. I have head they need quite a bit of stimulation. More than the average kitty.
ModestDress,femuuhs,t1_fd69v9u,1579270212.0,"Frankly, i would wear this Muslim or not. I too snorkel and sunscreen has to be reapplied too frequently to be truly effective and, as you pointed out, chemicals in the ocean harm coral."

hummingbirds,fem1xm7,t3_epntih,1579237093.0,"Is that little guy ok? I mean, can he eat with that beak?"
keto,fel3equ,t1_fekrz9p,1579213206.0,Three weeks to a month. Closer to a month. It is kind of a concern for me because this is not the only change. I have to remind myself to eat. I have been checking my food logs and I am just under 1000 calories per day and that is with reminding myself to eat. I just don't have a taste for many things anymore.
90dayfianceuncensored,fel31ft,t1_fekww72,1579212976.0,"Well, you know they say there is someone for everyone."
WhatsWrongWithYourCat,fekoypl,t3_epn0q1,1579204596.0,That is hilarious!
90dayfianceuncensored,fekoalv,t1_fekd0rg,1579204200.0,"Unfortunately in America, healthcare has yet to become a human right. Personally I think this sucks but that is the current state of affairs. I, personally am not denying anything however I do believe our health care costs are out of control and we do not have equal quality of healthcare across the board. So when an individual without sufficient means is injured they receive substandard health care. Therefore it is incumbent upon the individual to do everything they can to not find themselves in such a situation. As I previously stated, it is indeed your body and your choice but why run the risk?."
90dayfianceuncensored,fekmzqn,t1_feke95p,1579203424.0,Thanks for letting me know. I guess I would have to switch to a laptop or desktop to see because for some reason it is not showing on my phone. Thanks again!
