That is to say nothing of the environmental impact in places like China.

 The idea that advanced manufacturing can't be done in under developed nations is nonsense. You only need electricity and water, both of which are available reliably in the relevant nations. The machinery can come in from anywhere and be set up by engineers from the vendor. 

The benefits of modern technology are irrelevant, they would be here with or without the trade deals. More than that it's about more than money or possessions, it's about purpose and dignity. Many people lost both to the Free Trade Blitz, and no amount of money can replace it."
