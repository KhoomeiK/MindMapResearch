bipolar,ff6lxrh,t1_ff55nhi,1579630015.0,"The increase in dose with lamotrigine can elevate ones mood a bit too much before leveling off. If I recall, 100mg is the bottom of the therapeutic dose. Hang in there OP, it might just take a little more time. I’ve had good luck with it so far despite bumps in the road"
bipolar,ff4rdfj,t1_ff4e9yr,1579570603.0,"Not to cast a cloud over your optimism, but it took me about 5 weeks before there was any effect. So don’t worry if it takes a little longer than expected. Once it works, you’ll know it"
bipolar,ff3zngq,t1_ff3xgn8,1579552349.0,Hope it works for you! Best of luck
bipolar,ff3l9bv,t1_ff3jq9y,1579543444.0,"I did this a couple weeks ago because I felt narcoleptic when my dosage was moved up. I wasn’t able to sleep well for a week after stopping, but I’m feeling generally better now. But this is just my anecdotal experience"
2meirl4meirl,fev3gum,t1_fev2yy4,1579392652.0,"5.5 is average on a 1-10 scale

Edit: I would like to thank all 8 of you that upvoted my comment about the average"
bipolar,fdenmp4,t1_fdef6vu,1578342816.0,I guess I just wonder if it’s the truth for me. Which I know is playing into exactly what you’ve said. I suppose I haven’t accepted it yet after all
bipolar,fdebln8,t1_fde39nl,1578335459.0,"Is that normal? I was diagnosed five months ago and have been thinking the same thing lately. Like if I went off the meds, relapsing would validate that there’s a problem, you know? Just my thought lately"
NoMansSkyTheGame,fdagi45,t3_ekfnkr,1578245815.0,Woah what sort of sorcery lets one do this?
