C_Programming,ff3s7js,t1_ff19xnb,1579547715.0,That wasn't the solution to my problem now but I'm sure it'll be helpful someday. Thanks

wholesomememes,ff0uyeu,t3_er0vyb,1579472513.0,It's 2020. We have got to train our dogs to use the toilet and flush afterwards.
pornfreewomen,feqe6gs,t3_eqavbn,1579340763.0,I’ve been trying nofap for almost 50 days and I think it’s helping with my sexual frustration very well. I’m also planning to get sexually active after marriage. I experience sexual urges maybe 5 or 6 times less now. I’ll try masturbating and see how it feels like afterwards but so far so good.
GetStudying,femptpi,t1_fem9jyu,1579266025.0,I wonder about your treatment too
relationship_advice,fegawsj,t1_fefqclt,1579085513.0,You are so right on the getting irrationally angry part. I couldn’t put it in words like that. Thank you so much. I’ll try to look uninterested. Don’t you think it will be more effective to straight up that I don’t want him than to block? I will have to fave him after all.
NoFap,fef5xgl,t1_fef5e1e,1579048947.0,"Yup, you could try playing piano whenever you feel urges"
NoFap,fef3yfg,t1_feddu61,1579047613.0,"Believe me I was a strong believer of the “sexual energy cannot be converted, just satisfy your needs and go on with your life” thing. 42 days in nofap I realize that I was sooo wrong. You don’t have to think of it like a certain kind of energy. It could be anger too. Or love. You just have a potential there, You can feel it. Just try and use it for whatever you want. When I feel high sexual energy I just open my compiler to write a few lines of codes. I say to myself “don’t worry about it. Just write printf(“hello world”); if you want to” but after the first step, the potential I have lets me go on for many hours. Maybe you could give some activities tries and see how they make you feel. Surprisingly working out or jogging don’t help me while programming or reading things that will work my brain hard calm me down. Find your own releasing activity."
