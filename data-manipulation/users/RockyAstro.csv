Depending on where the OP lives, there may be some free avalanche awareness presentations.  These little talks are not a substitute for a AVY 1 class, but will give you a chance to meet up with others.

At the minimum, try to take the companion rescue class.  This 1 day class will teach you how to use the avy gear and will cover what to do if someone in your group is buried.  From there, try to team up with some experienced folks (that have taken the avy1 or avy2 levels). 

Avy1 deals mostly with identifying avalanche terrain, how to plan for travel in / around avy terrain, an introduction to risk management and the most important is making safe decisions as a group. -- So.. I would say if you are with others who are experienced and trained and who you can trust.. you should be fine teaming up with them and use whatever resources you can (books/videos, etc).  The two big things you should aware of, 1 know your limits (be honest with yourself) and what you are comfortable with and that you can communicate that and 2 that your group goes over the hazards and honestly discusses the plans with input from everyone.  Yes you are relying on them to identify the hazards and to communicate with you.

Also be aware that being in the backcountry is a totally different world.  A lot of the education for the ""high-risk"" sports (climbing, kayaking, etc.) is dealing with risk management and learning and learning how to mitigate risks.  Experience helps you to identify/know your boundaries which is much more important when you leave a controlled environment. Inbounds, you twist a knee, you get packaged up and get a ride to the base no big deal other than you are out of commission for a while ...  In the backcountry a sprained ankle, a lost ski or a broken binding might end up being a major evacuation issue could end up taking the rest of the day (and maybe into the night) with a chance of frostbite or hypothermia.

There's the saying ""Good judgment depends mostly on experience and experience usually comes from poor judgement"" -- the key to surviving ""poor judgement"" is not overstepping the boundary so far that you become a lesson for others."

I like skiing the little nooks and crannies of the resort and I don't mind hiking (for example Twin Chutes at Breck, Tree Chutes at Abasin, etc.).  These areas get patrolled, but don't get a lot of traffic, so I tend to approach them as kind-of side countryish especially if it's been snowing."

MrRobot,ff3aaua,t1_ff2thf3,1579537301.0,"Unfortunately I only see him once a year in Sept.  But here is my interpretation of the ending.

It's an integration.    We see the alters (Master Mind, Mr Robot, his mother alter and his younger alter) finally getting to the point where they are all recognized for who, what and where they are (the whole 2001 Space Odyssey sequence).  None of the personalities are fighting for control but are able to exist with each other knowing that all (including the Elliot that I will call Elliot prime) are there separate but as a whole.  The ""cinema"" scene I believe represents where all the personalities get to see what was and is happening.  They all get to see Darlene greet Elliot in the hospital.  Elliot (all of them) are now aware of all the events in their past (the abuse from his father, his father's death, the hack, the prison time, etc.).  Elliot prime is going to need a lot of help to reconcile all the events that have happened (so yes -- the huge hack really did happen, the Master Mind and Mr Robot alters pulled off the great redistribution of wealth with the help of Darlene & co.).

What we saw through out the series was a particular alter having full exclusive control but also not being aware that they were an alter.  The one alter that does seem to be aware of the other alters is the Mr Robot alter, however the Mr Robot's primary purpose seems to be to keep the other alters locked up and unaware of each other, to protect the Elliot prime alter at all costs, to keep the Elliot prime locked in a ""happy bubble world"".  We see an example of this during the ""Alf"" episode where Mr Robot ""creates"" a world for the Master Mind alter to protect the Master Mind alter from the abuse of the beating while in prison (in fact the Alf episode might be a pretty good summary of the entire show).

What I got from my conversation with my friend was that failure to integrate would eventually lead to the real physical death (suicide) of Eliot -- which we don't see.  Instead we see him alive in the hospital.

I think in a certain sense Whiterose / Minister Zhang could also be viewed as having some sort of identity crises, in the end we see the possible result of non-integration where we see her state that Zhang no longer exists, then later Whiterose kills herself. (As a side note, I want to sit down and discuss BD Wong's portrayal of a trans-gendered with a relative who is trans-gendered to get their take)."

Basically if your opponent has an enclosed area, there is a possibility that it might be killed depending on the shape of the liberties.  Killing shapes have a vital point that will decide if the group is alive or dead.

Typically one would be looking for:

* some movement of a ""star"" which would indicate that it's a solar system object (comet, minor-planet, or a planet), or a multi-star system (e.g. binary star)
* change in brightness of a single ""star"" which would probably be a variable star
* appearance / or disappearance of a ""star"" - some sort of nova (or a variable star)

Once something has been detected, then further investigation can proceed (looking at more photographic plates, etc.).

The software package that I use for doing image processing for astrophotography has a built-in tool called ""blink"" that performs the same function digitally.

The follow is some of the mathematical topics that I've needed to rely on through out my career (I started in IT in the late 70's)

* Statistics
* * performance monitoring and measurements
* * reporting on failure rates (both hardware and software)
* * analysis of random number generators (resolving a bug in a random number generator)
* * data compression (one of my mentors was one of the developers of JPEG)
* Analysis of dates and calendars - writing and maintaining library functions for date manipulation (arithmetic performed on dates) 
* Lots of modulo arithmetic - hash tables
* Base conversions (being able to do hex arithmetic in your head is helpful when you get low enough in the system)
* Boolean algebra
* The one place where I worked, the company was heavily involved in digital image processing, color science, etc.  While I wasn't directly involved in that line of work, I did work closely with some folks that had PhDs in mathematics (the one guy had figured out how to manipulate images while they were still compressed -- he also had taught functional analysis at an university).  
* Linear algebra, vector calculus, wavelet and Fourier analysis (image processing)

My IT background has been low level (operating system) programming, so I've done my fair share of assembly programming, C.  In the past I was involved (hobby level) in the development and implementation of a computer language (early 80's).

Also there is some math overlap with some of my hobbies (amateur astronomy and astrophotography). 

I should also state that I'm an autodidact polymath.  I've never really went to college, but have learned how to ""learn"" what I need."

My breakthrough was to stop reacting to the aggressive play and to play solid.  Then all of a sudden the aggressive plays stopped working because the opponent had left all these weaknesses. As I progressed, the games became calmer as the opponents were realizing that attacking everything didn't work well.

Think of it this way  starting out DDK fights are ugly, typically wild swinging with clubs, expect a lot of blood.  As you get a little stronger the fights get a little cleaner but still pretty brutal slashing knife fights.  A little stronger more finesse, not as much blood more targeted attacks better defense, but still some blood.  Once you get to stronger single digit kyu the fights are more civil, the cuts are more targeted. Dan players are were you start seeing the skill and respect, till finally it's just  a little poke or jab, no blood at all, the two players will sit down quietly, have some tea,  the loser quietly nods off on their final sleep..."
