You say five year's . I had severe depression wanted to die all the time at 7 yrs old. It was more of a chemical imbalance. !8 yrs old is kind of a shitty time it is a in-between for most people, you need to focus and build your life, under 18 you think that is your life.

I could probably get my butcher to slice the tongue for me though, now that I am thinking. My brother is about to get an air fryer from his job for free... I will have to experiment.

side story. I cooked some pig tongue and my father came by and started snacking on it (finished browned) I saw him and he was like yum this is delicious, I hesitated, knew I had to tell him what it was... after he eats some more pieces I told him and his face turned and then he walked away. I had to say something, but had to try to prove a point that it's good!

edit: you can tell the difference but that is why I mention the onions and cilantro, no one will know."
Cheap_Meals,fe4sdz4,t1_fe4hb87,1578862325.0,There is no difference it just is the end of the whole piece which might not slice as nicely for people paying full price. Or it might rip off the deli hands fingers when slicing. It is about moving product. Presentation.
Cheap_Meals,fe47h29,t1_fe43i1l,1578856464.0,"I am thinking mac and cheese, then cutting some of the meat into cubes and pan frying them, then sprinkle some on top of the finished mac and cheese. I agree about the cheese but I think these firm cheeses will freeze nicely. They are on point though so, I have them in the fridge with a little hole in the bag to breathe out moisture."

Cheap_Meals,fe41rea,t1_fe3zsnb,1578854962.0,The guy whenever I buy it reminds me you can just freeze it if you aren't sure what to do with it at first. I am thinking of dicing some up and stuffing a chicken breast or pork loin with it. porchetta.

Cheap_Meals,fe3v2tj,t3_enl7eo,1578853165.0,"If you are interested, ask your fish monger for salmon heads. I get them $3 each ask for them to split it in half the long way. Make sure there is a good 1-2 inches of fillet on it. I was taught by a Jamaican woman to cook them basically onions, garlic,, tomato, bell peppers, thyme, maybe lemon or lime juice. then braise them for 1 hour and 20 mins around. I like them before they fall apart so you can plate the whole piece without it just breaking apart. Serve with rice maybe some greens. If you are interested in trying the eyeball, remove the bead and lens inside the eye and spread on a piece of toasted Italian bread or baguette, it is super creamy. When you cook the head this long you can eat everything the fat, the skin, the cheek piece, It is delicious. There are recipes for soup online as well. my recipe you could just google Jamaican salmon head recipe to get an idea.

edit: half a head serves a person."
Cheap_Meals,fe3npce,t1_fe2cvfi,1578851108.0,"If they seem unsure about discounting maybe they aren't in charge enough and will be hesitant, but in general I would continue to ask any day of the week you usually have some? etc. A place I used to go would sell the whole little knob end of proscuitto because it doesn't slice well and it is all fat and skin. expensive grand parma ends. would be nice in a chicken soup or something."
Cheap_Meals,fe3ezff,t1_fe2erv2,1578848702.0,"They say cut them up into cubes and add to omelettes, make a antiposto salad, add to regular salad. Maybe a quesadilla, pizza. grilled cheese. A lot of the meals you see on this sub you probably could add to like fried rice."
Cheap_Meals,fe3edus,t1_fe1bg7s,1578848512.0,Yeah.
