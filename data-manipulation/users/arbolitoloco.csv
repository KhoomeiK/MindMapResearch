productivity,fcrazz6,t3_eik4qz,1577899346.0,"I have anxiety and my therapist told me I had to re-learn how to relax, because my perfectionism (a trait connected to anxiety) and need to be in control of my life were getting in the way of resting.
I also believe those feelings can be a mix of societal expectations, ultimately connected to how capitalism transforms us into workers and consumers, and how we must be productive and efficient at all times, and our own attachment to the idea that our self worth is connected to our actions. So, in my case, ""doing nothing"" meant I was being just lazy and worthless, and the guilt would be overwhelming.
Not that I don't feel guilty anymore, but my trick is to constantly remind myself that sometimes I'm just tired, and that my value does not depend on my actions: we're all naturally worthy, and we're trying our best. So try to be kind to yourself, and remember that you deserve to rest. Keep repeating that to yourself until you finally believe it.
Also, something that might help would be to read this book called ""Rest"", by Alex Soojung-Kim Pang. IMO it's a very good compilation of history and science around that theme, and has helped me immensely in rationalizing the whole feeling. 
Good luck and thanks for coming to my TED talk!"

I see OP is based in Argentina, and I'm Brazilian but living in the US, and I was wondering how do Americans call this type of fabric?
it's been impossible for me to find it anywhere by the name we use, which is ""raw cotton"". googling only shows me a sort of cotton canvas, but this cotton in the photo as I know it is not really canvas weight, it's much thinner and soft, and also suited for doll making. I'd appreciate any tips!"
