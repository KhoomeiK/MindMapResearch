pics,ffcdst1,t3_esseij,1579797296.0,"I volunteer for the Red Cross and a couple of other emergency response orgs. If you make an evacuation ""go bag"" for yourself, MAKE ONE FOR YOUR PETS. I haven't yet met someone who left their pet behind, but it's common that they don't have anything at all for the pet they've kept with them. It's another logistics problem that would ease the family's (and pet's) stress a TON if they had a pet go-bag with them."

Of course I could be wrong but they don't look anything like other liberated prisoners that were photographed."

I *was* going to argue the point, but then I saw the pink background, artisanal typeface, and only two grammatical errors, and I've gotta just say--they've got me dead to rights. Their logic is inescapable, and I'm currently re-evaluating my position on all sorts of so-called ""scientific"" findings.

AskReddit,ff10pr9,t1_feuivsw,1579474067.0,My cynic opinion is that the pastor had a common late-night visitor that didn't know he was out.
