AskMen,ffhp2vz,t1_ffgr8ig,1579946331.0,I thought all of it was awful but loved the premise and wanted to enjoy it. I was told it'd get better after 6 so I pushed through. It didn't...
askwomenadvice,ffar4mh,t3_esdrho,1579742540.0,"I stopped wearing makeup and got the same comments. At first it bothered me but then I realized they were used to me looking a certain way for a year and it was just that my appearance changed more so than they thought I looked bad. It looked like I suddenly didnt have the time or energy to put on my usual makeup so of course their first thoughts are ""sick"" or ""hungover"". After a week, the comments ended. If they said something I'd just just say, ""no makeup"", and move on. It was a quick transition!"
trashy,ff8p7r4,t1_ff7mj8c,1579690020.0,Which is also insane. A family friend has storage facilities around the country worth 100+mil. He drives a 20 year old pickup that's starting to rust because he says cars (and houses) are bad investments and he'd rather use that money on things that will make him more money. Imagine turning away someone worth millions because of their car.
trashy,ff8oxvt,t1_ff8givq,1579689609.0,"Your Outback made people remember you and that's invaluable to a good sales person. It's a great talking piece and I'm sure made people trust that you know how to pick a car with longevity. As a sales person myself that drives a well loved 2010 Ford Fusion, I couldnt imagine it ever losing me a sale. I could use it as a talking point if needed but really, very few people have ever asked about my car other than to mention my bravery driving it in ND winters."

pregnant,femgvyi,t1_fem6er9,1579254888.0,My thoughts on the matter exactly. I just do half caff now and keep it to one a day. Except days like today where I'm unexplainebly up at at 3 am....then I'm having 2.

YouShouldKnow,fefocju,t1_fee8ymc,1579060768.0,"Our emergency fund is enough to get us some cheap car tires or a car battery. No car means no job and that ""savings"" doesn't get any bigger each month. If I did have anything for actual savings, it would go right to spending as much time with my baby as I can. Right now I'll get 3.5 weeks from pto accrued and we cant afford me taking anything unpaid. Our country is a very sad place for middle class and my hope is that someday people stop being so damn resentful of others and band together to resolve the issue."
fitpregnancy,fefjr0u,t1_fee3ek5,1579057788.0,"Start looking up and doing SPD/pelvic girdle exercises right now. Don't wait to start because if that's what it is, you want all the head start you can get and it won't hurt anything if that's not what's going on. I had a little pain one day and by the next week I literally couldnt move. There are excellent resources on youtube that helped me immensely and it took me a week of diligent stretching/strengthening to bring the pain level back down. Now I barely have any issues but I so wish I would have started trying to fix it before the pain got so bad."
PublicFreakout,feffnox,t1_feefnka,1579055329.0,"They do in most places. My 11 year old sister's molester has been in a protected wing since he was first arrested over a year ago. Has his own ""cell"" with a tv and even gets cell phone time."
airedaleterrier,fef837v,t1_feecfs2,1579050407.0,"Same. We haven't had any more expenses with our Airedale than our rescue ""mutt"". We do nails once a week, groom ourselves, just had a vet appt and her teeth are great...I don't even feed raw. She's on purina pro choice. I will say it took some getting used to training her. She is so smart and independent so it takes more thinking on my part. But, her goofy personality makes up for it."
BabyBumps,fee2q14,t1_fedwcbo,1579025170.0,My mom and sister will be there for mine and are excited to see it. My mom had 6 kids so she wants to see it from the other side and my sister is in school to be a PA so just curious (and has agreed to act as a doula). But they have never been pushy about it and wouldn't hold it against me if I change my mind during and kick them out...which is possible because I'm a moody bitch. I hate when people are pushy though. Birth is scary and stressful enough. No one wants to deal with crazy family on top of it.
AmItheAsshole,fee1yys,t3_eojuzh,1579024720.0,"NTA. Last year my grandma opened the newspaper, read for a few minutes and started laughing hysterically. We all asked what was so funny. Her abusive ex husband from 40+ years ago got hit by a car and died and there was an article in the paper about it. I don't think I've ever seen her so happy, honestly. Abuse can last a lifetime and make lives miserable. Your feelings are valid and I'm sending cyber hugs your way."

YouShouldKnow,fed73bc,t1_fecbtj8,1579001985.0,"Right?! My husband and I make 6 figures together but healthcare, 1k+/mo daycare, student loans, making sure we have something for emergencies, and we're down to not being able to spare the extra. We've taken the steps for baby to be healthy and happy during my pregnancy and once he's born. Right now that's the immediate priority. I was already told I shouldn't be having kids, though....maybe, but we've decided to give him a good life anyway. That means making sacrifices, including big monetary ones. We'll deal but I'm not spending hundreds of dollars on a will right now when it could have better uses."
YouShouldKnow,fed6eib,t1_fecn4gg,1579001104.0,"Ahhh, shucks. If only your advice had come 26 weeks earlier. I'm not spending a few hundred dollars on a will because I AM being responsible for this child. Unplanned pregnancy that we're making the best of. Sold our house and moving into town to afford the 1k/mo daycare. Weekend job to help with the 5k+hospital bill we'll have. I do really appreciate your candor, however. Bravo."
YouShouldKnow,fed66r3,t1_fecg215,1579000819.0,"Thank you! Have you used it? Most free ones that I've come across don't cover what they should and aren't recommended due to holes. I'll definitely look into this one, though."

YouShouldKnow,fecarzn,t1_fec87w6,1578969752.0,"This. I'm pregnant and wanted to have a will prepared, just in case. Can't afford it. Even going the online route is a few hundred dollars I cant spare due to hospital costs and saving for upcoming daycare. I always feel like the minority when I come across threads like this but I know that cant be the case."

It is true that there are things you can't control, but what people mean when they say it is that they're making a decision that's most likely asshole-ish and they're using the saying as an excuse/validation. Parents are the worst offenders."

AmItheAsshole,fdvol4u,t1_fdty250,1578749725.0,"This exactly. Eating for some people is addictive and they do really need there to be no temptation in the house. They didnt go about it in the right way and should have had a conversation with you to get you on board but I hope you do find some empathy for your sister. Try a sincere apology and sit your mom down and ask what you can do to support your sister but still be able to have snacks in your own room. I like the idea for a lock for your backpack. Tell your mom that since you're trying to step up and support your sister the best that you can, youd appreciate if she'd pay you back for the food of yours she threw away. Your mom may not react appropriately at first but dont get upset. We're all human. Tell her you hope she'll take a step back and think more on it later and you're proud of her for what she's doing for your sister. It's slightly manipulative but will help clear the waters with your mom and then you can move onto sister. It's hard sucking up our pride but it often rewards us much better when we do."
AmItheAsshole,fdvlyuu,t1_fdtvewg,1578748830.0,"I think this is a very mature, empathetic response. Much too rational for this sub."
MaliciousCompliance,fdvj5pn,t1_fdqkb5t,1578747978.0,"WTF--this is all awful. I am never scrutinized at my job as long as I'm getting what I need to done. I tried taking 4 hours of pto last week because my horse got out of her pasture and my boss said to delete it. If corporate closes for the day on a non-holiday, I'm not expected in and definitely do not use pto for it. It sounds like you're in a horrible work environment all around, I'm sorry. There are much better companies and bosses out there, I promise."
MaliciousCompliance,fdvgs2w,t1_fdryi1p,1578747243.0,"This is exactly what I would do except not 1 minute past 9. Since she's typically 10 minutes late, I'd wait until 9:09 and email the boss that question once a week. Maybe pop my head into their office on another day to ask, ""Hey, where's Karen? I've been looking for her everywhere"". Switch it up a bit so it's not completely obvious."
AmItheAsshole,fdve4xk,t1_fdt9eml,1578746464.0,"Yep, and he's honestly lucky. I wouldn't cook for him at all. I'd make just enough for myself and the kids and he'd be on his own until he started pulling his own weight."
AmItheAsshole,fdvd2pg,t1_fduba9w,1578746187.0,"Ya, when my husband and I have life changes, we just roll with it and it's never such a big deal. He works at a college and over winter break gets off work an hour earlier than me so he's been making dinner and feeding the horses before I get home. I didnt even ask him to. Last night he made me boxed scalloped potatoes and green bean steamers. Definitely nothing fancy but it was good and probably took him 10 minutes max. It's usually pretty easy to pull your own weight. Some of these stories boggle my mind."
AmItheAsshole,fdtdhxp,t1_fdsdtt8,1578715201.0,Not for free. They should pay for gas and time. That takes away from work and study. I'd charge at least .60/mile.
RealEstate,fdm71wn,t3_ely0bz,1578541382.0,"Fargo, ND and we are finally seeing a downturn. Just sold my house and my realtor brought up the rough market when it didn't sell immediately. It took us years to find anything with our acreage and we had competition to get it. Was a lot of work to get it sold now and we lost money on it."
pregnant,fdm3cpg,t1_fdl28pf,1578538829.0,I have PTO only so I can only take 4 weeks off. My husband is a state employee so he gets to use his 6 weeks of sick leave to take over and then will use his saved up pto for if baby gets sick. My husband will literally get more time off than me and I'm pissed about it. I wish your husband got more time off but it's great to hear his company offers 12 weeks paid time off for moms. Bodies and minds take a lot of time to heal after birth and caring for a newborn.
insaneparents,fdh3k1j,t1_fdgxm02,1578414618.0,"Right?! And then they think they have proof and spread their dangerous misinformation to others and before we know it, the herd has holes and people die."
fitpregnancy,fdgilc8,t3_el3n3s,1578398314.0,"For me it has been! As soon as I hit week 13, my headaches and nausea went away. I'm 25 weeks right now and going through horrible pelvic girdle pain (effects about 1 in 5 pregnant women)  so my biggest recommendation is to do as much for your pelvic floor and pelvis as you can now because you'll regret not doing it later. It's mostly just stretching and breathing for the basics so easy peasy even when you're feeling rough."
insaneparents,fdggy44,t1_fdgaq7l,1578396323.0,"Exactly. There is no way to engineer a vaccine that is 100% efficacious for every single person. We are all unique individuals with differing immune systems, environments, etc. The scientists do their best to get that number as high as possible and then rely on herd immunity to do the rest. That's why anti vaxxers are extra dangerous. They put everyone at risk, not just themselves and the immunocompromised."
insaneparents,fdf4qvt,t1_fdeahsm,1578353277.0,"She didn't at the time, of course. I bring it up every once in a while because I'm the oldest of 6 and she has really settled down and has a very relaxed parenting style with the youngest kids. It's funny to both of us looking back on it. We have a great relationship now and she's a very different person. It's amazing what therapy and changing one's environment can do--i was a pushover so I'm sure her parenting with me was the one thing that made her feel in control."
insaneparents,fddq7k8,t3_ekrjke,1578321036.0,"My favorite, and I still bring it up to my mom, was when she grounded me for driving my friend home without telling her. It was winter and she lived with her elderly grandma who was nervous driving after it snowed. So I drove her home and then picked up my mom as usual and we went home. Apparently she was tracking thr odometer each day so knew I had driven extra and asked me about it. She grounded me for a month for lying by omission. A month later, same scenario for my friend. Drove her home, picked up my mom and immediately told her. She thanked me for letting her know and grounded me for 2 weeks. Thanks, mom."
AskReddit,fddpnw7,t3_ekt5n3,1578320585.0,Yes. I honestly could just say I was out on sales calls and no one would question it.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fcx139n,t1_fcwz6m1,1578046495.0,I'm 14 and 18 years older than my 2 youngest siblings and these are my fondest memories of them as babies. My mom would just pass them off to me for nap time and go nap herself and they'd cutely doze while I watched tv. The plus side to having such a gap between kids.
