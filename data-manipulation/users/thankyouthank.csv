I never disregarded your criticism.
you were just so obsessed with the word cynical, and associating with negative.
I just pointed out it doesn’t have to be perceived that way.
I love feedback and constructive criticism, it allows you to be better at what ever it is that’s being criticized, by making it apparent. One of the key components of my job involves giving and receiving feedback. 

Work on whatever it is that causes you to write an essay about what was said, how it was said, how it was meant to be interpreted, whatever it was.

Tinder,ffg33y5,t1_fffppae,1579897420.0,"you make a good point in all of that.
though, it’s meant to be a little cynical because people literally use their dogs as a prop to peak interest. some people literally take pics with a dog just to give the assumption that it’s their dog... but don’t state otherwise. 
though, I don’t blame dudes for using their dogs to get attention... I mean, it’s all the hype. 1/10 girls, minimum, will mention something about dogs in their bio.
