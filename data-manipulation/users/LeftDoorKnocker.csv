antiMLM,ffr5p7g,t3_euqc3c,1580151019.0,I’ll never understand this. Why the hell would I want to work 24/7 when I can be out of work at 5 everyday and spend the rest of my evening and every weekend doing whatever the fuck I want?
CatAdvice,ffg9ktp,t1_ffg7fgz,1579901405.0,"Yeah, you can definitely try that!"
CatAdvice,ffg74zo,t1_ffg5om6,1579899899.0,"No problem! If you do go canned, they make very convenient little lids for the cans. Most pet stores should have them and they come in different sizes for the different size cans."
CatAdvice,fffwfe8,t3_etem7t,1579893285.0,"If he won’t take it with food/pill pockets, you can try those little pill launcher things. If you can’t find one of those, when we had to give our cat metronidazole we ended up having to burrito him in a towel, open his mouth and stick the pill in the back of his throat. It was miserable and he hated it but it was the only way he’d take the pill. Couldn’t hide that thing in food if we tried, he’d taste it gag and run away. Made sure to give him tasty treats and lots of pets afterward."
CatAdvice,fffvdya,t3_ete266,1579892627.0,"Hard to say since every cat is different, but my 6/7 month old tuxie boy is currently getting 1.5 3oz. cans of wet food a day, split into 3 scheduled meals. He also gets 1/3 cup dry food that I put out in the morning that he munches throughout the day. It seems to work for him. He’s about 8lbs. and his body condition score is right where it should be."
horror,fffpiz6,t3_et4bh3,1579888996.0,"I really loved this movie. Everyone I've talked to in person has said they hated the ending, and I can see why someone might not like it but I thought it was perfect."
SCAcirclejerk,ffflndn,t1_fffbwl4,1579886633.0,"Only a PORE goes all the way downstairs for their skincare, duh!"
childfree,fffkubf,t1_fffk92l,1579886139.0,"Lol, right? Like I'm pretty sure my 8lb. cat uses a fuckton less resources than a human being."
childfree,ff6kw4y,t1_ff6gia4,1579629381.0,"For real. I’m only 27 and the change from never getting hangovers to feeling like death the next day seemed to happen as if a switch was flipped. Like my body one random day when I was 24 was just like, yeah nah you’re getting a hangover today and also everytime you get wasted. I now have a pretty defined threshold of “if I have one more drink, I’m not gonna have a good time tomorrow.” Luckily I always know when I’m at that threshold and can decide if the pain the next day will be worth the extra drink or not, lmao."
childfree,ff6fs4c,t1_ff68hye,1579626245.0,"Lol, same. I’ve only gone to work the next morning hungover once and said never again. I’ll have a drink or two but I won’t get drunk. I save that for the weekends when I can sleep until 2."
truechildfree,ff68tti,t1_ff39aa0,1579621842.0,"I feel this. Not married, but we’ve been together like, 10 years now. Perfectly happy with no kids running around.

Not wanting kids and not wanting marriage is a double-whammy shock whenever either are brought up in conversation with friends/family, lol."
cats,ff42bbe,t3_ere8ga,1579554002.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss, but I’m so glad you found her! My thoughts are with you as you and your other kitties move on from this tragedy."
cats,ff40c5y,t1_ff3zn2v,1579552771.0,"Of course it’s always at night/early am. That’s good to know about high humidity. One in our basement is in a smaller room where our workout equipment is, I’m always paranoid while working out that it’ll get humid enough to set them off, don’t know if that’s possible or not. The false alarms are absolutely worth it though. At least it lets you know they’re working."
cats,ff3zcwi,t1_ff3tkjk,1579552164.0,"This. There’s a fire alarm in pretty much every room and hallway of our house, all hardwired together so if one goes off they’re all going off. Does make it interesting if one goes off on accident since the only way to shut them all up is to find the one that was originally set off. Some renovations were being done before we moved in and the people working forgot to put covers on the alarms, all the saw dust set them off and they were running around like mad trying to find which one was triggered. All those alarms going off at once is LOUD. Will definitely wake you up in the event of a fire."
cats,felyozv,t1_felrzm7,1579234345.0,"Lol, freshly poured glasses of water became his water dish. You think you’re getting yourself a glass of water, you’re really actually getting him one."
cats,felfu1u,t1_feldqkx,1579221177.0,The best fruit
SCAcirclejerk,fekwlq3,t1_fekuwoi,1579209108.0,"Right? Like, doctors aren’t always right, sure I get that and everyone’s skin is different. If your 15 step routine works for you, great! But if it’s clearly not working, maybe taking the derms advice to cut some products out won’t hurt, lol."
ChoosingBeggars,fekk7xx,t3_eplznn,1579201780.0,"""Please forgive me.""

Lmao. Yeah, no. Absolutely take them to small claims ."
childfree,fekew9k,t1_feka2bp,1579198599.0,"Yeah, it's annoying as hell especially at the breweries. Aside from going downtown at night, I can't remember the last time I've been in a bar for dinner and some drinks that didn't allow kids. Granted, some places have less kids than others but if they serve food, they're considered ""family friendly"" here."
SCAcirclejerk,fek4i0p,t1_fek3gtx,1579192430.0,"Lol yep, that's literally my routine. Morning is rinse my face when I'm in the shower then moisturize, that's it (unless I know I'm going to be in the sun a lot that day, I'll put on sunscreen but I don't wear it everyday because I'm a heathen. Also I work in a windowless office so like, why?) Night is facewash, the azelaic, then moisturizer."
SCAcirclejerk,fek30vl,t3_ep99h2,1579191538.0,"Srs. I got sucked into the ""I need every product under the sun and a 1000 step routine to fix my face"" and it made things significantly worse. Finally caved and went to a dermatologist, she politely said stop it and sent me on my way with azelaic acid and a simple routine (wash, prescription, moisturizer) and my skin has never been better, lol. We did try minocycline first and that did not work out well...turns out I'm allergic."
SCAcirclejerk,fek2dz6,t1_fej927g,1579191148.0,"Yeah, it's fine if it's not too heavy for you/doesn't break you out. For some reason it burns like hell on my face, but I can use Cerave PM no problem..."
childfree,fejx0q4,t1_fejjpqg,1579187793.0,"I don't know, I'm in the northeast and it's pretty widely accepted where I live. The only bar/pub I've never seen kids at are the college bars downtown. Every other bar, pub and brewery in town 100% allows kids at any time of the day."
ChoosingBeggars,fde2dop,t3_ektr07,1578329631.0,I’m sure he calls himself a nice guy too
AskReddit,fcxrnez,t1_fcxqddv,1578069515.0,"Ahh...yes of course, maybe that’s what she meant. She would be correct if that’s the case, lol."
AskReddit,fcxpge5,t1_fcxmhhj,1578068391.0,"Nothing wrong specifically with essential oils if you like them, the issue is with the MLM oil companies like Young Living or Doterra because 1) they’re an MLM and 2) the huns shilling the stuff tend to claim they will actually cure cancer...and depression, and chronic pain, and autism, and pretty much everything that could ever afflict you, lol. I’ve actually had someone tell me to DRINK a spoonful a day of some essential oil for weight loss..."
antiMLM,fc6g4i0,t3_egf9uc,1577479770.0,"A girl I went to college with that is also an It Works hun just posted about this too. Her posts are annoying but this one actually made me angry. She also made Christmas post that basically fat-shamed Santa, lmao."
