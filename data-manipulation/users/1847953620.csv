HumansAreMetal,fejpekq,t1_fejajhn,1579182409.0,"This is rich. She *chose* to stay, which can be interpreted in different ways, but one of the points is that it validates what you said was impossible earlier: that she would choose to stay if there was an option. Given the fact that her plan worked is at least a some form of argument against the risk of what could've happened if it didn't; and while the article does not go into the risks vs pros or such plans, the maturity of hers or anything else about it really, you come right out of the gate asserting ""Fire plans are based on the safest options available""

Again with the big claims. Big claims McGee over here. (Then a bunch of red herrings.)

Fantastic.

Oh yeah. It's funny how you didn't do the research yourself either up until now, so pot-kettle much? I mean, not that it was a real clincher for the reason you started name-calling people anyway."
HumansAreMetal,fejojzu,t1_fej8hpc,1579181706.0,"You were quick to call someone stupid, ignorant, and uneducated under the exact same pretenses. You should really get a physics degree. If it won't turn you into a firefighting superhuman it'll at least let you achieve the maxim of education and knowledge that it is in your eyes."
HumansAreMetal,fej9a19,t1_fej8fhc,1579162486.0,"methinks that's sort of what you're doing, too. Adding exaggerations as afterthoughts to defend the position created from your name-calling. I don't blame you for being upset about an insult to her if that what you got from that, but still the whole pretending that she ""knew what she was doing"", leaning into the whole macgyver thing, and most importantly saying that you ""trust her choice over [the other redditor's 'ignorance' that one must always leave if one can]"" specifically because the redditor must be uneducated and ignorant compared to a physics teacher is all a bit of a stretch. You're no saint in this, either.

To the other redditor's point they at least make it sound like they know of people who *do* stubbornly choose to stay and try to save their homes, which honestly sounds like what some people would do (to me) as well, which would then ""give them reason"" to at least use it hypothetically inside a conditional, which is exactly what they did. Being a physics teacher isn't a stamp that guarantees perfect everpresent rationality, either. Meaning you also don't have reason to dismiss the idea that she stayed out of stubbornness so swiftly. (Truth is, we don't know yet.)"

HumansAreMetal,fej7ncl,t1_fej5s2y,1579160336.0,"ever hear of survivorship bias? do you understand how risk and probabilities work? she had no way to be certain of the outcome because there's no way to properly assess the risk in the first place, especially not when you're limited in time, it was incredibly risky in a sense that is virtually incalculable. she got out. kudos to her. but that's no example to tell someone to follow if you're looking out for their safety first and foremost. You also don't really see front-page news about other smart people, scientists, and I guess physics teachers who undertake risky shit in the heat of the moment (even though they may take *some* precautions) and don't make it. Are you counting those in your evaluation of what is smart and what isn't? In what qualifications you need to apparently ""know what you're doing"" when surrounded by a fire, so expertly that you're free from criticism?

HumansAreMetal,fej5izt,t1_fej3d7l,1579157732.0,physics teachers aren't necessarily know-it-all mcgyvers who can science their way out of any life-threatening situation. I doubt she had a blackboard full of math and a coffee table full of research papers that she needed to determine that it was a real cashmoney thing to do that was fully backed by science. I mean fuck unknown unknowns am I right? I'm sure there's a ton of studies out there on probabilities of surviving fires of the same caliber by humans who jump into pools with scuba gear with properly controlled variables all of which happened to apply perfectly to her situation.
