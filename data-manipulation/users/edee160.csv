""I'm a 9 year season pass holder and I work for the state""...yeah, how'd that work out for ya? LOL.   Gotta love when people throw around their jobs/career/place of employment as some type of leverage.  Always bites them in the ass."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ffjt35o,t1_ffhuo04,1580006198.0,"I had a guest to catch an attitude with me last night for asking his correct phone number.

Apparently the one we had on his reservation, which was coming from his sparkly member profile was incorrect...so when I read off the last four digits he looked at me  bepuzzled, and rattled off the correct number -- for which I was not prepared to type in at that moment. lol...my bad.

So when I asked for a repeat, he was clearly bothered, and said it about 2 octaves louder, looking straight at me.  I was...surprised by this to say the least, and I put it right back on him by telling him that I didn't mean to upset him.  He said that he wasn't upset, but I was hoping that he would realize that he was going through unnecessary measures over a phone number."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ffjser7,t3_etptq2,1580005678.0,"> and while nothing excuses the things he said to me I am still way more angry at the idiot who neglected to check the guest in. 

This is the worst, I think...to be yelled at for someone else's fck up.  And the guest doesn't care *whose* fault it is.  We're all synonymous to them."

The only thing you can do is apologize, and ask how you can make it right.  If the compensation that the guest suggest seems too outrageous, then negotiate somewhere in the middle."

Oh I didn't see where it said that.

\*points to the exact number of the listed rules that states this rule\*

Oh Okay, Thanks!

\*Reads next shift report\*

Had to tell guest to get dogs out of pool as NO DOGS ARE ALLOWED IN POOL. 

This continues to happen at least 2 MORE times during this particular guest's stay.

lol...people."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ffeqzhq,t3_et5pq5,1579861175.0,"I had a YT/IG ""comedian"" stay at my hotel a few months back.

Him, his wife, their kids, and his assistants.

I subscribed to him on YT, and looked forward to his videos on IG.

After his stay at my property....

I unsubed, and would unfollow him on IG, but I never followed, thankfully.

He was a dick and his wife was a stuck up snob.  Kids were cute though.

I wish I could go onto his videos and air him out without giving away details.

He was stand-offish, curt, just all around unfriendly.  Not at all like the persona he tries to perpetrate on YT and IG.  His wife was bougie as all get out!  Total diva!

That's why you can't believe ANYTHING you see on social media."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ffeqmrm,t3_espqu1,1579860657.0,"> He then drunkenly stared at me for several uncomfortably long seconds  

I swear, time stands still when that happens.  I can hear flowers grows, and the flap of bees' wings when people just stare at you for uncomfortably long seconds...which feels like lifetimes."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ffeqcra,t1_ffe24h9,1579860239.0,"Oh, def. if you clock out and put a sign up, don't show your face.  They'll just have to respect the fact that you're on a break, and return when you're break is up.  Even if they knock on your door like they love to do me.

I had stepped to my office for a drink of water and watched a guy roll in with his luggage from the entrance, and around the corner to my office door without missing a beat and knock on it.  I was like Oh, for real?!?!

I come out and just look at him, and he says...no one was at the desk.  I said, yeah, I had just stepped back for a drink of water.  He says, oh it's okay, I just want to check in, and I'm like NO!  It's NOT OK!  Respeck mah authoritah!  \~ Kidding, but I was mortified.  How you just gonna roll in non-stop and knock on my door.  Clearly, he was used to doing this.  Very of unguestly of him."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ffeq2gq,t3_et3k7h,1579859806.0,"You're just Hangry.

Honestly, as I was reading this, I looked up at my camera and saw a guest standing at the desk.  I go out and she only wanted to hand me her key.  And I think to myself, when I first started here and used to stand at the desk in the morning, people wouldn't even stop.  And if they did, they would just drop off their keys and keep on truckin'.  So I become accustomed to this, and would sit in the back office and watch the cams during my shift.

NOW, as soon I as adopted this way of working, all of the guests want to stop at that desk when I'm not there, and have this look on their face as if they've been standing there for bijillion years.  And they want nothing more than to tell me they're leaving, and place their keys on the desk...they don't even hand them to me. They don't even want a receipt.  They could have done that without me there.

I may be Hangry too."

Shit, made me angry reading about it.

Everything you said is true, but when people value nothing in their own lives, it's hard for them to see the value in other people's lives.  She was a sociopath."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ffep5af,t1_ffdcnfc,1579858396.0,"Yep.
