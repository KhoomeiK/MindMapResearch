Showerthoughts,fdcrs53,t1_fdcl5j1,1578282468.0,It honestly just depends on the kid. Some kids have varying levels of focus and hyper activity. And ADHD medication have some pretty intense side effects. Some kids just lose all energy and appetite while on medication. At least on they can have the excitement to go play and have the appetite to eat full meals.
Showerthoughts,fdcr182,t1_fdc1gpv,1578281906.0,"I find you argument flawed for a couple reasons. For one, ADHD isn't used to keep you alive. If you stop taking it, your not going to risk dying. And two, it only takes like half an hour to an hour to kick in. Skipping the weekend isn't going to make it ineffective on Monday

And with ADHD meds, it's a bit different. Some people are hyper, some are just innatentive. And ADHD meds have side effects. One being a suppressed appetite. 

 I was diagnosed with ADD when I was a kid. I wasn't excessively hyper, I just couldn't focus. I was on an off my meds a lot as a child. But when ever I was on it my appetite was nonexistent. I'd try to force myself to eat and I would gag from the effort. I was never underweight, but I was close. My Dr said if I ever started losing weight, she would pulle off the medication. In addition to not eating, I just didn't feel like myself. Sure I could listen and pay attention, but I was uninterested. I wouldn't talk and I just sat there. I was unhappy on it. So sometimes it is unnecessary to medicate all the time. And occasionally it is a genuine break to be off of it.

It was one of those exercises where it's ran twice. One team is going to fail no matter what, so it can be pointed out what you did wrong. And I was on the first team and the village immediately hated us because of the MRE and we failed our mission.

Then the trainers asked everyone what we did wrong and of course the MRE was pointed out. And the trainer said we didn't think about that. I get that he was trying to make an example, but damn it, at least give me some credit. I knew from the begging how he was setting us up to fail."
