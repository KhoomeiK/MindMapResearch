todayilearned,fcj4cnc,t1_fcj3cr9,1577676960.0,"I do believe i may have been misunderstood, my claim all along was that if intention is the primary mean of evaluation it's impossible to behave morally if you believe you will be rewarded. My personal views on morality was made clear in the post i made before said claim.

I used law as an example as that is the most mundane application of moral philosophy we have, a crime is fundamentally the subversion of the minimum acceptable moral behaviour. And, i would argue that the fact that intention influences sentencing is an indication of the fact that it is a partial measure of whether an act is virtuous or not, but not the full measure, as i pointed out in my previous post. The act is in itself inherently wrong, but how wrong it is depends on why it was done - partial measure."
todayilearned,fcj2gxa,t1_fcj14t0,1577675625.0,"Well, if you're an intentionalist the argument is both relevant and acceptable. Not necessarily saying that intention is a good solitary measure for evaluation of an action, but it seems pretty well established as a partial measure in most (all) western legal systems, which would indicate that we tend to view intention relevant in the determination of the morality of an act, and if so we're kind of forced to conclude that, assuming noone is watching and no external rewards the same good deed by a non-believer is more virtuous than by the believer, even though they would likely do the exact same thing no matter what.

Though i personally would argue that evaluating human action using systems designed ny humans is a futile way to distinguish what is Good and what is not."
