NoStupidQuestions,ff26ydb,t3_er1vm8,1579495569.0,"US here. My college sells my phone number to scammers. They claim they don't, but we've had full class discussions about this, and everyone with their phone listed through the ""emergency campus alert"" has this problem. When classes start each semester, for the first 2-3 weeks, us students get numerous spam calls a day. One day I received over a dozen before noon. Had to turn my phone off because I was at work. All about ""social security number is being frozen"" ""there's suspicious activity on your <random> account."" ""You've won publishers clearing house, but need to pay taxes"" ""your health insurance has been cancelled'.

They are always easy to spot because they're either from a completely random state (like Ohio or Maine) or they're from my cell phone's area code (spoofed to look like they're from nearby). I moved, so my area code isn't the same as where I have lived for the past decade. There's no one there who I still speak with, so no one should ever call me from there. And if it's an old friend, they can leave a voice mail.

I used to let it all go to voice mail, but I recently got a new Google phone, and it has Call Screening, so now Google tells them to frick off on my behalf. Best purchase ever."

DnD,fek2xv8,t3_epcsyz,1579191486.0,"I had a character die once and it resulted in some fun. It was the group's paladin and he was well-loved by the other players and NPCs. He died sacrificing himself so the sorcerer could get away from a large group of ogres. He managed to kill nearly all of them, and fought to his last breath, allowing the remaining, nearly dead party to down the final enemy. The party did a big burial and spoke about how they loved him, what he meant to them. It was really touching.

We did a bathroom/drink break (to allow the paladin to create a new character) and the party necromancer (who never got along with the paladin) pulled me aside and asked if he could secretly raise the freshly buried corpse as a permanent zombie (he gets one permanent minion). I was torn, but let him. The necromancer always had his zombies wear head-to-toe clothing and masks so NPCs wouldn't notice the character was a decaying corpse. During the long rest, while he was on watch, he dug up and raised the paladin's corpse, put his current zombie in the grave, and cleaned back up the gravesite. He dressed the corpse like his current minion. The party woke, all failed their perception checks, and carried on. A friendly neighborhood druid joined them soon after (the paladin player's new toon).

About 3 real world months later, the party was in a neighboring kingdom, and the druid made an offhanded comment that this ""was the city his paladin was from"". It was then we all remembered his backstory was Noble. The paladin was the 6th son of the king and had gone out to make a name for himself since there was no way he was getting near the throne. Well, things weren't going well for the joint. Plague was rampaging through kingdom turning everyone into mindless zombies. The clerics were working on a cure. Long story short, the party made a small mistake which caused the royal family to be turned into the walking dead and were killed. The kingdom didn't have a king. Chaos ensued. Finally the clerics managed to get in touch with a God who agreed to cast a super-honking cure-all which would turn all still ""living"" zombies back into humans. The whole kingdom filled with healing light.

I told our necromancer that he was now without a minion because his had been ""cured"" like all the other zombies and was now alive. The player went pale. And I handed the druid player a character sheet. He looked at it, confused....
Him: ""This is my paladin""....
Me:""yes it is. He's alive again.""...
Him: ""The spell reached the woods?""...
Me: ""Nope""....

The ex-necromancer-minion pulls off his mask and there stands the paladin. Dirty. Confused. No memory of anything.

The necromancer yelled ""All hail the king!"" Jazz hands and all. And was promptly put to death by the party."

I'm talking as little as $5 a pay period. Doesn't have to be much. So long as you're not living in the red, you'll hopefully not notice the small decrease to your funds. Most employers will pay with direct deposit and will let you split paychecks into two banks. If not, just have your bank account auto-transfer the money each month.

I originally used this for Christmas presents. $5/week will get you $260 at the end of the year. As years have gone by and we've become more financially secure, we've opened a couple more accounts and have the same small amounts of funds go in each month. We have a vacation account, emergency account, home upgrade account, college fund account, and computer parts account. And each month $5-$25 goes into each one. When a tree fell on our house last year, the $2000 deductable didn't cause us too much stress because the emergency account had us covered."

So when I do roll well, it makes it all the more exciting for the roleplaying.

That and their greatest enemy is themselves. One found a big hole and wanted to see how deep it was. So he chucked the gnome into it. I think we spent about 2 real life hours around that hole.

AskReddit,fcy0679,t3_ejdlbw,1578072818.0,"Bit of a rant, but...my uncle. I used to adore this man, loved hanging out with him, loved all the quirky things he was into, loved him like he was my own father. He was always there for me. His passion is to cook (but was stupid bad at it lol) and anytime I had a birthday party, to make sure he came, I always begged him to cook me something (Mac and cheese, or pulled pork, or anything) just so I could see him excitedly bring these MASSIVE trays of food over and show off all the meals he'd made. I'd always eat so much and tell everyone how good it was and he'd beam with pride.

Well, in 2009, I was dating a Marine. This sweet young man was killed in action right before our second anniversary. I was a wreck. My boyfriend and I were getting serious, making plans for when he'd get out of the military in a year, talking hard about our lives together. Our families loved each other. We'd been friends for years. Young love.

Well, somehow, my favorite uncle turned this horrible time in my life to all about him and made the next few weeks a living hell. He started talking to news and radio stations without telling any of us or my boyfriend's family, told everyone he was the uncle of the girlfriend of the Marine who was just killed and he relished the attention. My boyfriend's mother woke up one morning to discover 3 news stations sitting on her front yard and all saying they'd been promised an interview by my uncle, a man she had never once met. He started making plaques and pins and all sorts of things, only these items had my boyfriend's name in teeny tinny letters and my Uncle's Company Name is big, bold ones. Wanted to throw parties ""to honor him"" while the rest of us just wanted to grieve in peace. He gave out our cell phone, home phones, addresses, emails to so many people without our permission. And when we didn't want to be in the spotlight, he was quick to jump in and try to be himself.

I'm sure he thought he was helping. I'm sure he meant well. But we just wanted to be left alone. Thankfully, about a month after his death, the hype had gone away and the media no longer cared. I went back to college and eventually met my current husband (who is a wonderful man who I adore and who adores me). It's been 10 years and I still haven't forgiven my uncle for the stress he put us all through. Our relationship hasn't recovered, though I don't think he realizes I'm angry with how he acted. I moved away and rarely visit, and when I do, I pretend he is still my favorite person, because I know how much it means to him to have me in his court. I still praise his horrible food. I still laugh and hug. But inside I'm a ball of hatred."

I have one dream place that is this gi-freaking-normous library. I first visited it when the place was clean, new, lots of people, no dust. It was like a castle, tons of floors, spiraling stairways, books all over. And I was looking for one specific book, but the book was hard to find, and when I finally found it, it was in the attic where a bunch of random people had been captured and chained to the wall. No one in the library but a few workers knew about the captives. Dream self was like ""this is koooool"" and I woke up not long after. I revisited the library numerous times in other dreams.

I ended up in the same library a few years later, but time had passed and the place was rundown, dusty, a ruin, destroyed books everywhere.
