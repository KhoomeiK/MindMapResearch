Logic would dictate that we would take the extra revenue ASAP, but we're SO fucking greedy that we can't decide where the revenue will be appropriated. Looking at you scumbag Long Island Dems + entire republican party. 

Luckily we're grouping this years budget in concert with Connecticut and (if I remember correctly) New Jersey, so we have no reason to embarrass ourselves among our friends. (LOL)"

Honestly out of my Jr, Runt, and OG, the Jr is the toughest to learn (Let's not talk about my Flip Brick). The Jr is fast acting so it's easy to burn, highly suggest keeping the restrictor disc in there. 

Once you master it (i'd say after 20 or so uses) you most likely won't reach for anything else for a while."

vaporents,fdtxec2,t1_fdsv3gi,1578723770.0,"If you aren't a tinkerer, but hate the lighter, i guess this looks ok as a cheap option. 15 second heat is scary though. I have two Lucid heaters as i'm partial to beautiful craftsmanship. My wall plug old style metal box apollo takes about 5 seconds cold to click, about 2-4 bowls depending on how dark you like it. My battery powered bubinga one takes a bit longer, maybe 7-10 seconds cold to click depending on the battery charge. Never 15 though. Not at all hating on OP here though as I paid like $300 for both of mine and he/she paid $60ish. 

TL:DR, I'm a non-paid shill for lucid customs lol. Seriously though, I love mine, and it forced me to find another use for the case of butane i bought....three words...STICKY...FUCKING...BRICK!!!"

AdvancedVapeSupply,fd062m6,t1_fd05a1u,1578114173.0,"Editing for clarity: 

Oh come on, you’re way more experienced at this than you led on :) 

On your glass piece: As for flavor, no effect at all, been using it for years. 100% of the iso will evaporate. I do a rinse where I shake it real good until it’s clean, dump. Then a ‘rinse’ with much less iso to remove any of the dirty iso left, then dump. You can leave your piece to dry, but for your piece id recommend hitting the sink and running warm water through. Then you’re done and can use immediately. 

On the reclaim: do the above, but dump the first wash in a dish, then proceed to clean your piece. I honestly haven't made QWISO (quick wash iso hash) in a while, the taste isn't amazing but the effects were tremendous. Also i've never made it from anything that was in a water piece. Just be sure to let it ALL evaporate, minimum 24 hours, longer the better. 

Everclear/grain alcohol has been tossed around forever. I used it in college, then realized how dumb it was to regularly seek it out. Iso is better due to price and availability in my opinion."
AdvancedVapeSupply,fd02l7q,t3_ejckv8,1578112711.0,"Man, some of the answers you've got here are..interesting at best. If you think this is bad, wait until you start dabbing..lol one dab session can cause this alone. 

I don't think it's worthwhile at this amount, but the only way to reclaim here would be to get 91% or better isopropyl alcohol from your local store, (you'll definitely want this anyways to keep the glass clean), rinse with the smallest amount of iso that will make it clear again, dump into a pyrex style glass dish. Let evaporate for at least 24 hours keeping protected from dust. Scrape, enjoy. 

&#x200B;

Back to cleaning, though. Get iso alcohol if you plan to enjoy any flavor. I'm sure you already notice a smell. To clean, dump the water, rinse with iso shaking vigorously (save or not), then rinse with water to avoid a sticky iso coating on your glass. It'll prolong the enjoyment of your piece. Good luck!!"
vaporents,fcxjumk,t1_fcxjdux,1578064708.0,"Apologies, i should’ve elaborated in the fact that the capsule sits on top of the 5/8 screen it came with, i’ve never had any pull-through. Bottom screen remains clean. This is generally useful to keep wood protected from the typical buildup. I use it with the top off (no capsule lid).

I believe the main reason George said not to soak is because liquid can get trapped underneath the disc that creates the clicking mechanism. He can’t, in good faith, recommend a bunch of customers soak in a highly flammable liquid when they will be putting a torch directly to it."

In my experience, if the vapor is less than or equal to the cig buzz, 100% never a successful smoking cessation device.

I think the trick is to go high on the nic to start. You need that ‘woah, these things really work!’ first impression instead of what most people get, ‘it’s not my marlb-‘"
