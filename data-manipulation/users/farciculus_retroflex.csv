&#x200B;

But in all seriousness, this is my exact situation too. Het marriage and love him to pieces, so general feelings of erasure abound! I am on the quieter side about my leanings (I'm at an age where all my close friends are married as well, so it's just not as relevant at this point, since everyone's just with who they're with.)  As a subconscious reaction to this, I embody every single bi stereotype on the books- cuffed pants, tucked in shirt, multiple ear piercings, chin length bob (when I can be bothered to maintain it), wide trousers with tucked in blouses (a go-to bi biz casual look), and dresses + tights + combat or engineer boots. Cat eyeliner (every. single. day.) and a dark lip. Leather jacket every time the weather even remotely allows it. 

As I get older, my style is leaning more ""practical and comfortable"", so I'm excited to see what my transition into ""aging bi emo woman"" brings."

This is so true. I can sit at my desk at work all day and can not have the attention span to get through one sentence, and yet in one weekend I went from not knowing what a cream puff was made of, to making a croquembouche that I could have charged good money for. If only the hyperfocus was on something useful :("
femalefashionadvice,fee9f14,t3_eon8bw,1579029123.0,"Sigh. 

The last two weeks have been rough for me mental health wise and I don't know why? Nothing in particular has happened, but I can kind of feel myself slipping back into the mental state I was in when my depression was at its worst- not sad, just completely numb. One of my best friends is also dealing with a lot of grief right now so I think it kind of makes me feel stupider to feel sad for any reason since everything is going comparatively fine for me but I can't help the dumb things my brain wants to do. My poor husband is trying to help and I think it frustrates him that there's no concrete problem that he can fix for me, so he keeps offering me tea and showing me pictures of cute animals. Admittedly, that treatment strategy's not **not** working. 

&#x200B;

What may be frustrating me more is this hiring process that's been going on since October- that's right, **October.** The job is in a field that I've wanted to break into and am trained well for, and the industry is one I like as well, but one that has a notoriously long hiring process. I interviewed in October and was given a tentative offer fairly quickly, but the necessary admin and salary negotiations have been taking a loooooooooong time and every day that goes by, I get more and more anxious that this position is going to go up in smoke. My mom also keeps making things worse without meaning to by asking if I've heard anything back yet regarding this job on a pretty regular basis. I know she's just excited for me, but she doesn't quite understand how my anxiety works and got all sad the one time I snapped at her and told her that I'd tell her if I heard anything, and to stop asking. These people keep breaking their own deadlines though (I was supposed to hear back last week about a higher salary I was trying to negotiate, but they said they're still waiting on approval) and all these things together are putting me very on edge. 

&#x200B;

On the plus side, I've gotten super in to ClassPass though and am now able to feed my spin class addiction with a plethora of local studios. Some days I still feel like I eat like the cookie monster but at least I get to offset that + burn off  jumpy anxiety energy by being overly aggressive at spin class?"

todayilearned,fdqfly5,t1_fdqdxct,1578665430.0,">Not to even get me started on some Americans who “can’t understand” aka never try to understand accents and grammatical differences.

Ugh this is so true! I wonder sometimes if I have more of an ability to understand variations in dialect than others (I'm American, born and raised, but was raised in the boonies of New England which has its own strong regional dialect, and now live in the South, which also comes with its own dialect) in addition to being raised by my Indian immigrant parents. I do code switch a fair amount even in English (my family in India can't seem to understand my ""neutral American"" accent much less the New England one I default to, so I subconsciously switch into a very light Indian accent when speaking to them and adopt some of the turns of phrase (i.e, ""shifting"" instead of ""moving"", etc.) 

&#x200B;

But the way some Americans act I'm like...use your brain! My father, who has lived in this country for 35 years and speaks perfect English, once said ""vessel"" instead of ""pot"" and the person he was speaking to acted like they had like they had never heard that word before and was like ""HuH? I dOnT  uNdErStAnD?!"" and kept making him clarify until he said like, dutch oven or something and then they were like ""ooooooooooooooooooh a pot!"" Like dude. If you can't figure out that the word vessel, when used in the context of cooking, means something to cook or put food in, the problem is YOUR brain, not my dad's accent.

todayilearned,fdqdatp,t1_fdq1ask,1578663616.0,"I'm South Asian-American, and I've long held the theory that South Asian English deserves to be its own dialect, like Scottish English, Southeastern American English, etc. 

British colonizers were in South Asia for so long that it's a first language for a lot of people there- it's learned concurrently with the native tongue in most middle to upper class families, who receive formal education in English (this is especially true in South India, where language and writing system change as soon as you cross state lines, so to do any kind of business on a larger scale, English is necessarily the lingua  franca.) However, when a language migrates to a country and stays there for multiple generations, it evolves naturally, mixing in the local language with outside influences as well. 

The rapid introduction of American culture post-independence has really sped up this linguistic mutation- my grandfather and my cousins, who are all fluent in English, speak it really differently. My grandfather, who grew up in the 40s when India was still a colony, would probably call someone a ""bloody bastard"" if he was mad at them, which is very UK English-influenced; my cousins would be much more likely to call them an asshole, which is very American. 

This is all to say that I think instead of Indian English being thought of as just ""bad English"" (which I'm convinced is just a form of UK/US ethnocentrism), we need to study it as a language in its own right, almost like Scots. 

(this is not to say that there aren't plenty of people in South Asia who actually do not know English, but as you say OP, many of those that do are just speaking Indian English instead of the English they **think** they should be speaking from having watched Friends, or whatever.)"
AskReddit,fdjuw05,t1_fdjjlml,1578488292.0,"I was waiting for this too. All these comments about  how ""my mom realized her faults and went to therapy and we're working on mending our relationship"" really hurt the most because the thing I want most in the world, more than anything else, is to be one of those people that says ""my mom is my best friend!"" 

I didn't really realized how messed up my relationship with my mom was because my two best friends growing up were also Asian (different kinds of Asian than I am, but the culture seems to carry through) so I was 18 and in college by the time I understood that it's not normal to always be stressed around your family, to start asking yourself what you've done wrong every time the phone rings, to just accept that you're always going to be a disappointment in your parents' eyes without ever really knowing why. 

I've been out of the house for about 13 years now, and moved several states away for the only acceptable reason in Asian culture- to further my education. Time and age have provided me with a few pieces of perspective: 

* Having a partner who comes from a similar culture/similar family structure to you helps immensely. My SO doesn't get annoyed at me when my mom arbitrarily decides it's time to devalue everything I've accomplished and all the goals I've set in life- he talks me through it and helps me understand (although I haven't internalized it completely) that my mother's validation is not necessary for me to have a fulfilling life. 
* Find a therapist that comes from a similar background to you. I've been having particular trouble with this one- although I've had a few wonderful white therapists that have really tried to understand my situation, the energy I spend explaining to them why I, a woman in my 30s who lives 500 miles away from my mother spend most of my waking moments at least a little worried about if she's mad at me, reduces my desire to actually re-program the way I feel. 
* No contact generally isn't an option for Asian child/parent relationships, so moving to ""meaningless contact"" (as one of the above posters mentioned) has been really helpful for me. I find that the parent metric has more to do with time spent and hours put in; the actual content of conversations doesn't matter as much. So if the option that will most likely preserve your mental health is to pick up the phone, or visit your fam, try and keep conversation to things that are innocuous, like cooking, or TV shows, or a perennial favorite- talking shit about an extended family member/friend that you mutually dislike. 
* Empathy has probably been the most important thing in helping me cope as well. When I was younger I had a lot of rage about how I was raised- I saw the relationships my non-Asian friends had with their parents and cursed my own fate, angry that I had never been nurtured in that way. But carrying that kind of anger gets bad for you, both mentally and physically, and I realized that unless I want to get heart problems from having such high stress levels, I need to find a way to let it go. I realized then that while our parents' way of bringing us up may have been incredibly damaging, it's because *they are damaged too.* It's the only way they ever understood child-rearing to happen; weaponizing guilt is as culturally ingrained as eating rice. Perhaps almost more sadly, they don't realize that the emotional tumult they feel isn't normal, so they've passed it on. In a way, we're lucky for having the resources to realize that the way we were raised is not okay, so we don't propagate this kind of emotional trauma to our own children."
xxfitness,fddjq6g,t3_ekl7zt,1578314986.0,"I wake up at \~5:30 am, leave the house by \~6:30 am, to be at work by 7. I don't shower in the morning, so waking up involves hitting the snooze button at least one, putting the coffee pot on, and watching youtube videos on my phone while brushing teeth/washing face/putting on makeup/getting dressed. 

I usually leave the office by \~3:30 to be home between 4:00 and 4:15 pm. I have a little snack (usually two light Wasa rye crisps with a little jam), and take the dog out for about 30 mins. 

Note that my workout schedule is a little imbalanced: On weekdays, I work out Tues/Wed/Thurs, and then again on Sat/Sun (which are more flexible, since I don't work weekends.) Tuesdays, I try and get a workout in during my lunch break in the office gym, which frees me from having to go after work- if I don't get a chance to do this, I leave the house by \~5pm, work out for 45 mins to an hour, and get back home by 6:15- 6:30. Wednesday nights I do a spin class from 6-7 pm, but that's my husband's night to cook dinner (we eat each meal 2 days in a row- I take the Monday/Tuesday block, and he takes the Wednesday/Thursday- Fridays we usually go out or figure it out as we go along, since Friday dinner is a ""cheat"" meal for me) so I come back from spin class ravenous to a lovely hot meal. I generally telework on Thursdays and keep my usual schedule, but since my commute is no longer a factor, everything becomes 30 mins earlier. 

Either way I'm usually done eating by \~7:30 pm, shower around 8, have some tea and fruit or maybe a light dessert at around 8:30, and brush/floss/do nighttime skincare/take the dog out around 9:30. I'm generally in bed by 10 and try and be asleep by 10:30 or so."

Then I moved out and could make a bread omlette and...that's it. I can post some more of my fave websites here if that'd be helpful for you: 

[Hebbar's Kitchen](https://hebbarskitchen.com/): post recipes from all over India but south indian is their specialty 

[My Heart Beets](https://myheartbeets.com/): Punjabi girl married to a Mallu guy, so an interesting combo of recipes. She also does a lot of healthier twists on traditional recipes, and has a lot of Instant Pot recipes as well, if you have one of those

[CookingShooking](https://www.youtube.com/user/CookingShooking): This is a youtube channel and this guy genuinely has the most AMAZING recipes. I've made some pretty involved things by him and they all turn out like, the best version of whatever it is I'm making. His English isn't amazing (but definitely passable); however, if you understand Hindi he's got a channel called CookingShooking Hindi that's easier to follow IMO because he's much more comfortable narrating."
xxfitness,fcyffqh,t1_fcy67nj,1578079274.0,"Dosa is what breaks my heart the most because my mom makes bomb mysore masala dosas with potato masala and coconut chutney and chutney powder inside and I'm crying a bit just thinking about it T\_\_\_T

I don't know where you get most of your recipes, but if you go on youtube at all, my favorite chef on there is VahChef (also at [vahrehvah.com](https://vahrevah.com)) He makes ""healthier"" variations of a lot of traditional South Indian foods (think ragi or millets idli, or ragi dosa.) I've also seen instant mixes for ragi or millets idli (like the just add water types) and because my shameful ass doesn't make my own dosa batter, I've bought ragi dosa batter from the Indian store before and it turned out really good! For me personally though, a ragi dosa is just never gonna warm my heart the way that a normal one is, so I've resorted to portion control with this one. If I'm eating dosa for breakfast, I'll only have one and (sacrilege!) I put spinach and peas in my potato masala to bulk it up instead of it being all potatoes. If it's dinnertime I'll let myself have two, but I limit my potato masala consumption and try and make tomato-onion chutney instead of coconut, to keep the overall calories down. 

The thing is though, the way I feel after I eat dosas (especially when I'm visiting my parents and my mom offers me a second or a third and I can smell it and I just can't say no) is straight up terrible. Last time I visited my parents, I had two dosas for breakfast at 9:00 am and tried to go for a run at 1:00 pm and had to stop halfway because I thought I was gonna puke and just felt so slow and sluggish. I'm not sure what it is but those things have necessarily become treats for me because once I switched away from eating like that all the time, indulging became physically punishing. This also probably has to do with the fact that I'm much older now than I was when I was inhaling like 4 dosas in a sitting but I prefer not to think about that :|

[Pesarattu](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/andhra-pesarattu-whole-moong-dosa/) makes me feel much much better. It's all moong dal (the green ones, with the skin on!) and just a couple of tablespoons of rice in the whole batch of batter to help it get crisp. I often don't need more than one, because the increased protein content makes it sit much heavier, and you add green chilis and hing and ginger to the batter, and you can dress it up with chopped onions so it's exciting- just in a different way than dosa is. 

This summer I was craving South Indian food but the last thing I wanted to do was eat a hot bowl of sambar, so I went on a kick of making [usli/sundal](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/6370178-black-chana-in-coconut-kadale-kaalu-usli) and [kosambari](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/kosambari-recipe-moong-dal-kosambari/). Usli or sundal is based on chickpeas or pulses of some sort, and kosambari can be made from any vegetable that you'd enjoy eating fresh (carrot + radish is my fave combo!) but also contains soaked moong dal, so they make light but satisfying summer meals that are very fiber and veg heavy.  I'd eaten both of these things growing up but they were always ""festival foods"" and not made on a regular basis, which blows my mind- they're so much more balanced than the endless cycle of rasam + rice that we ate on a daily basis."

I know you meant no offense but this is a huge thorn in my side- the Indian food you see in most restaurants in the West a) came from a certain type of cooking that is known for being super rich/kingly (and is NOT, therefore, everyday food), and b) was heavily modified to suit white palettes."

I do HIIT and cardio cross-training \~4x a week so I'm not about to cut out rice (which makes my Southie self very happy) but it's probably the #1 thing I'm careful about when I eat. 

I'm very strict with the amount of rice I eat, and it's almost never white rice. There's lots of non-white rices to choose from, and I'm having fun kind of going through a culinary tour of India via different types of rice. I let myself really fill up on rasam, sambar, and poriyal/thoran/palya, though. Also, I never serve a meal without veggies. If I'm making rasam + rice, there's \*always\* a non-starchy vegetable to go with it (cabbage, beans, etc.) If I'm making upma, there's always vegetables in it, and I generally throw big handfuls of leafy greens in daal. I'm lucky in that I hate idli anyway, but when I'm forced to eat it, I limit myself to two. If I'm still hungry, I eat some mixed veg sambar to fill myself up. I've also switched to multi-grain chapathi atta (which has a lower glycemic index than regular wheat atta.) The availability of millet products in Indian stores is increasing too, and barnyard millet and ragi are great options- I even made hakka noodles from barnyard millet noodles I found in the Indian store the other day, and it came out great! 

I also love pongal/khichdi, since the daal and ghee balance out the nutritional profile. I've also largely switched to pesarattu or adai over dosa, since dosa is much higher in simple carbs. I'm still a bit overweight but considerably less than I was before, and I find that this diet gives me the energy to smash my high-intensity workouts and doesn't make me feel sluggish. 

One thing I'd add is that I feel like Indian culture really undervalues exercise, and moving your body in general. And no uncle, eating two helpings of biryani and a bowlful of halwa, and then taking a stroll around the block doesn't count as exercise. I'm happy I realized its importance when I was still relatively young and able to incorporate it into my lifestyle, and I'm sure I'll be reaping the benefits of a regular exercise schedule in the decades to come.

This is not to say that I don't still eat the Indian food that's horribly unhealthy  from time to time- vada pav makes me weak in the knees- but I acknowledge that a vada pav plate is a whole ass meal, not a snack like a lot of Indian people treat it.
