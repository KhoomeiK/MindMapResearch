To your other points I guess it could be that I remembered wrong about the mutation, though I'm pretty sure there was something like this in MHF, but it could be the Mandela effect.Your last point I agree on."
MonsterHunterWorld,ffezlhu,t1_ffeyuds,1579871456.0,"Did you overread 

\> **A breed of Yian Kut-Ku**

Also I read a bit into it, the Garuga you fight in MHF1 is a scarred Garuga and was stated to be a mutated Kut-Ku. Garuga was introduced as a sub-species of Kut-Ku in MHFU.

But apparently they retconed the lore in 4 where they are now close relatives as you said."
MonsterHunterWorld,ffeybsl,t1_ffexswt,1579870262.0,"Ofcourse it is, it was explained in MHF 1 that the Garuga is a Kut Ku mutated by I believe it was toxins.  
The ecology extract from MHF 2/U states "" *A breed of Yian Kut-Ku with a hard black shell and a long mane.* """
MonsterHunterWorld,ffer7ve,t3_et7due,1579861519.0,"So, the only MH games I played before World were Freedom 1, 2 and United and Tri. I believe only Unite had G-Rank and it felt a lot harder, though I think that has different reasons like me being younger and bad at the game, weird controls on the PSP and crappy hit boxes (looking at you fishy boy). I finished Iceborne with only the Nerg variant left to kill (and tempered elders) and so far it has been a cake walk with the exception of Velkhana (carted twice against that frosty shit head)"
