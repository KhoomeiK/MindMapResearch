In terms of moving the table, it's set, moving a table is moving a table, for the most part. If the comparison you're making is this table or purchasing some other table, we can ignore the cost of moving it. If the comparison you're making is having a table vs not having a table, then you should consider the moving cost, but having a table is pretty cool, so let's not go there. So, like I said in my first comment, the slate is the expensive part and unless they really abused it, it should be fine. The next part is the wood. If the wood just has scuffs and other marks, call it character and move on, it won't affect play. If it has actual water damage that affects the table's ability to be leveled or moved, then you need to call in an expert, but I would imagine a moving company would be willing to tell you that. Finally, we have the wear and tear shit that is clearly not so good on your table. You're probably looking at about 600 bucks to redo the cloth and cushions. That will bring the play on this table to damn near brand new if not absolutely brand new. This is not required in order for you to enjoy this table though. You could spend the 500 on moving it. Enjoy the table, get to know it, shit cloth and all. Then, when you've recovered from spending 500 on moving it, start saving up for a refurbish. You'll probably appreciate it more than if you had it all done at once. I live in the UK and the only non-UK (read: normal) table I can play on is at a snooker club, and based on the picture and what you've said so far, it's in worse condition than your table. You'll still have fun with it before the refurbish. If I were in your shoes, it would not be a difficult decision, I would take it."
