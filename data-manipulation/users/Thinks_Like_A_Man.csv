You told me you couldn't help me with college and I should just find a job. I did just that. I think if that you should pass that wisdom on to your other children. They, too, should just find a job.

This is straight up emotional abuse. See it for what it is. It was not thoughtlessness, this was a deliberate ""fuck you."" He left the receipt in the bag so you would find it. He showed you the Aunt's gift as a passive aggressive swipe at you.

My ex did this. It was $10 in Wal-Mart gifts bought at 9 pm the night before my birthday handed to me in the bag with the receipt. I thought it was a joke. Then I started crying. He then got mad for making him feel bad and I was a grown ass adult so why did I even need to have my birthday acknowledged? But his mother had to have a ton of thought into it.

So I told a relative this story. They forced him the next year to buy me hundreds of dollars in designer gifts and throw me a party. My ex fucking pouted through the whole thing, literally sat in the corner and would not speak to anyone.

""The decade from 2020-2030 was aptly named The Shift. The designation spoke more about the changes in attitudes, economics, politics -- even religion -- than it did about a transformation of global priorities. Workers did not necessarily need to be organized to achieve their desires. Anger, if deep enough and sustained over a lifetime, proved to be sufficient to unite a populace toward a common goal.

""As the looming climate crisis became apparent to even the most uneducated among skeptical conservatives, being ""woke"" was associated with the understanding of the power of sheer numbers of those desiring change. 

""What began as a way to exert political pressure to end police corruption and institutionalized racism soon turned into a powerful movement to collapse the economic system. 

""The generation born at the tail end of the 20th Century, known as Generation Y to academics and as 'Millennials' in popular culture, viewed capitalism as a systemic disease which infected every aspect of society. Eventually, an understanding that an economic system which rewarded greed and selfishness could not serve the best interests of humanity and must be stopped. 

""After losing faith in a dying political system and failing government institutions that served only the wealthy aristocratic class, early leaders of The Shift mobilized a generation who had been demoralized. Their loss of hope and anger was amplified and redirected at those who refused to act on the behalf of growing poor class who were the most vulnerable.

""As a group, they latched on to the notion that they had both nothing and everything to lose.

""In the process, a new form of protest was born. It did not require the loud, organised and prolonged protests of the Hippie Generation. The Millennials adopted one of punishing apathy. 

""No longer waiting on the slow wheels of the political machine, leaders of The Shift simply called for an end feeding the economic beast. It started as a movement to protest unaffordable housing. By refusing to buy real estate (which was largely responsible for the Recession of 2021), the global banking system was brought to its knees. Realizing the power of numbers, the protest quickly morphed into mass boycotts of the largest corporations responsible for the environmental damage.

""Generation Y may not have had financial leverage or political clout of earlier generations, but they were connected and passionate -- some might say even vengeful. Through sheer numbers, they dismantled a global economic and corrupt political system. They had long accepted their fate, resigned to a life of poverty on a dying planet. 

""The ruling class had served them a shit sandwich, and by God, everyone was going to take a bite.

""History has often ignored the positive aspects of The Shift. The movement was largely responsible for planting a trillion trees, and starting the Earthers religious sect. While it was clearly the most tumultuous decade of that century, it was also the most pivotal."""
