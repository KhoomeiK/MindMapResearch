You should use actual facts instead of lies if you're gonna try and win an argument. They said It was in the game since the end of S2, and it got ramped up right after the first duos mode left in S3, that's when all the complaints started rolling in. It's pretty damn easy to see SBMM when the under 3% of players that have Diamond or Pred ranks are somehow all in lobbies for anyone half decent. If SBMM was actually working it would be putting them against each other. Not to mention the literal description of ranked is to fight against your own skill.

This quote is exactly why you don't understand and don't care; because you don't have any idea what it is and clearly are bad enough to not be dealing with it. 

The game isn't fun anymore, you can't get into a game if you're half decent and not be put up against pre-made squads of diamonds and preds, yet according to respawn, there are less than 3% of total players in those two ranks combined. If people wanna play sweaty, that's what ranked is supposed to be for. That should not be the casual game mode. 

No one, at the end of a long day, wants to come home and get stuck playing a sweat fest against pre-mades, especially when this current system seems to think it's okay to put two lower skilled players with a good solo somehow expected the solo to carry against pre-made squads...

There will always be negativity and backlash for any action taken by anyone. When your response to community feedback, done by people being rational with their criticism, and those being negative (by a minority) is to insult your entire community in a reaction to the negativity; then you, as the dev, have made the mistake. That is not a gaming community exclusive that goes for any job, and almost any situation. 

Then continuing on that path and continuing to react, lash out, and insult your community, *ESPECIALLY AS A COMMUNITY MANAGER*, instead of doing what you job entails is directly related to the place seen as their main hub of information turning into a cesspool instead of a mixed back with a minority of it being extremely negative."

You have proven you have no idea about what a community manager is supposed to do, and highlighted my point exactly. Any one can choose to focus only on the negative and they did just that. When your job is **Literally** to manage the community and you turn into a child lashing out you have done nothing but drop fuel on a fire. 

You can go to any gaming sub at any time and see negativity from people. Instead of only focusing on that and lashing out real community managers do their job of relaying the issues to the devs, communicating to the player base while doing so. They do not choose to only stick on the negative. They do not choose to call their community freeloaders, they do not choose to pretend like they are innocent after their actions have directly fueled the comments they chose to lash out about.

No one said one person was being toxic to the devs. No community is all hunky dory and happy. The Devs on this game choose to focus only on the negative and lash out. Their ""Community Manager"" chose to act out extremely badly, so much so that in any other company he would have been fired. Prior to that they have literally called this community freeloaders at the same time as praising their profits from cosmetics. 

There used to be plenty of posts about ideas, suggestions, map fixes/tweaks, and bugs that should be addressed. Instead of focusing on them they *picked* to focus on the negative comments from people. 

By lashing out instead of doing what any other gaming devs do, focus on the positive as much as possible, they turned the community into a toxic center, against them in almost all areas. They changed the comments towards them from being a mix of good and bad into more negative while they constantly ignore their community. 

Pretending that isn't true is just flat out stupid.
