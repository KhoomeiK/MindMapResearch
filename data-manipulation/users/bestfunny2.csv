Be kind to them as much as they frustrate you and keep this as a learning lesson for the future. But they most likely have stuff to contribute to the team, whether it be experience or the knowledge on how to deal with ""the big wigs"".

I am dealing with a very similar problem. I am working part time digitalizating records. My co-workers (bosses) are late 60s and think microfilm is the way to go for everything. I do however like my boss its just she cannot handle the new technology. She was a museum curator/ archealogist for a historical site for 30 years, the site she was in the generation 1 of founding it.

Needless to say, I have a similar problems and feel your pain."
legaladvice,ff84n77,t3_es5ymg,1579665878.0,"Just went through this, I was the history major, who took poly sci classes and went to college with a ton of lawyers (pre law college)  in the same area as the fed jury duty took back.

according to the state reps, best to do is simply submit your paperwork, if you get called allow them to interview you and then they will let you go. There is very few ways to get out of fed jury duty and the best they can do is sadly postpone not exempt you.

Yes, its a hassle, yes you are most certainly not going to be on a jury but there are few ways to get out of it."
college,fefy5l6,t3_eouk9x,1579069155.0,"if you have the time to spare, I would try to do both. As I got into jobs often that boiled down to the school paid me to study. So I got a paycheck to study for my classes.

Your choice tho."

Simply go to the library and meet more people in classes. They come and go, especially when you add in semesters abroad."

college,fe62y45,t3_entcf9,1578880597.0,"this happened to me freshman year in an all girls dorm. They all went to private schools and I went to a small country school. I overheard a conversation where they discussed how rich I was or was I pretending to be poor.

Needless to say, I tried to keep my head low but these girls were a bit crazy and made me miserable. Luckily by then the year was over and I never had to be around them again. I was so relieved to find other girls who were more my type and background who I became friends with after that."
cocacola,fdt09r7,t3_emxh2x,1578710254.0,got mine tonight. I am very excited for all of the items. The drinks are in the fridge as they need to be cold to try. But I am truly looking forward for the upcoming boxes.
relationships,fd7osp1,t3_ek9gce,1578207761.0,"I admit I read my astrology at times. But just for a laugh and I do not take it seriously. Personally, I feel that if your astrology says you are going to have a good day you will as you think you are going to have a good day. I do not believe in essential oils but got several essential oil candles from bath and body works. Never thought about it until I got home and I bought them simply because they feel bad.

Personally, I think you are starting to outgrow  these friends. So start meeting new people. You do not need to cause trouble, simply these friends are going into directions you are not going to follow. This happens in a lot with friends in hs. I talk to one on and off but otherwise have very little in contact with my hs classmates especically those who did not ""follow"" a similar schooling path as me."

If this is a new thing (starting recently) I would ask him about that as something does not sound right.

I come from a small family. Through marriage we have several ""toxic"" branches of the family. We (my immediate) admit there are toxic branches and are limiting interactions with them."

This way you can see if you have down for a roommate(s) or not. If it blank then you are having a single (at the moment) otherwise wait and see if they do show up.

I (my soph year) had my grandmother die on move in day. Had I not been moved down there (we got the call as soon as my parents got home after a 1 hr drive). I know I would have been dragged into that and probably would not have been able to move in that day. So give some slack on the roommates/dont jump to conclusions."
