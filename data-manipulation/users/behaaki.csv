WeatherGifs,feppz2w,t1_fenevvq,1579327418.0,"Worst blizzard I’ve ever driven in (Toronto to Montreal), I’d followed the line of traffic, then the semi in front of it.. then I had no one in front of me. Total whiteout, could not tell where lanes were - finally the trick that worked was to look out of the side window to keep track of where the edge of the road was. Worked well enough to get past the worst of it.

Generally - be chill, don’t try to get there in a hurry. Avoid switching lanes when the road isn’t cleared, don’t pull over on the side of the highway, make sure you’ve got plenty of gas in case you get stuck and have to keep the car running to stay warm."

todayilearned,feaaaea,t3_eo69vw,1578946223.0,"Lol since we’re sharing cultural honking differences..

In Montreal, if the light turns green and you wait longer than 0.05 seconds to move, you’ll get honked at.

People also tend to squeeze through any tiny gap between other cars (like, one lane turning right, the other turning left — I will take the middle with two inches to spare thank you very much). So often you’ll get a quick little “heads up I’m thru here” honk."
