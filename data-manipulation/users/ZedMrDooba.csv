AmItheAsshole,ff5npl7,t1_ff5599e,1579602112.0,What?! I imagined a 14 year old at most.
Brawlstars,ff3r0vk,t1_ff0psv9,1579546989.0,What? Players who already completed the trophy road cannot get the new rewards.
Brawlstars,feqb2iz,t3_eqe7k3,1579339628.0,"Yea, hopefully there is some information we're missing."
Minecraft,feja062,t1_fej6sja,1579163479.0,Use a screen recorder and replay mod
PSIkiKusuo,fefzuuf,t3_eorw9c,1579070998.0,I do too! This will take a long time lmao
ClashRoyale,feemgea,t1_fed7p2s,1579036729.0,"That's pretty nice, I didn't know about that site. The game should have that site built in imo.

You can just search ""a"", but that's not really intuitive. I didn't think of doing that at first."
ClashRoyale,fec8f9r,t1_fec3vbs,1578968460.0,"If they were always available, sure. They aren't though, not consistent on a daily basis"
ClashRoyale,fec1ax1,t1_febx598,1578965194.0,I mean I'm still playing so... I feel like Clash Royale would have more players if they added something like this.
ClashRoyale,febqc06,t1_feboy1g,1578961559.0,"That's true, but I feel like Supercell's made such a great base game that I would just like to play that fairly, without any party factors. Obviously they couldn't make the whole game tournament standard, but at least alleviate p2w a little bit for f2p players."
todayilearned,fe6otku,t1_fe6dyez,1578898577.0,"Yea, but he replied to a comment talking about engineers seeing people get run over right in front of them."
todayilearned,fe6brne,t1_fe6azpf,1578886405.0,You're willing to see people being run over in front of you for $100k? You do you I guess

PSIkiKusuo,fdoiskw,t1_fdn3nyo,1578605994.0,"I think they were pretty good, laughed at a lot of jokes. Since they just adapted non-adapted chapters I feel it was pretty similar to previous episodes."
PSIkiKusuo,fdlfbm7,t3_elybvf,1578522793.0,"Some manga chapters have not been adapted, but season 2 is complete. Unknown if a full new season will come out, so currently:

> Season 1

> Season 2

> Season 3 (Finale, 2 episodes)

> 6 netflix episodes."
PSIkiKusuo,fdlf7ne,t1_fdlbohr,1578522726.0,Apparently dub actors changed though

Minecraft,fdd9acd,t1_fdd7m4e,1578300781.0,"> It's possible he used a screen recorder and did not intentionally crop out the sign, which would explain the quality being lower than the original video. I would also like to point out, if you watched the whole video he steps back and shows the entire sign either way, nothing he has done is claiming it's his. The only thing he did wrong was not linking the original in the title, that of which he linked in the comments"

StarWarsBattlefront,fcvhrsm,t1_fcvaqwh,1578002358.0,Just play a game where you only use the default spawn
OnePiece,fbh8r19,t1_fbgpyrl,1576867909.0,I thought it was revealed that Blackbeard isn't a real D? Your point still stands though.
