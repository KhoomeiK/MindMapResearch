SkincareAddiction,feoc0bm,t1_feo6f3k,1579297963.0,i love it so far! on my second tube. :) i bought it at a store that carries only beauty products! (beauty language in singapore)
SkincareAddiction,fene6mz,t3_eq3kr8,1579282770.0,"skin type: combination (normal/oily)  
concerns: PIH, fine lines, too oily  
skin goals: a more even skin tone, fewer breakouts

**CLEANSER**

* clean it zero cleansing balm original (banila co) \[PM if required\]
* **refreshing facial wash (simple) \[AM+PM\]**
   * a drugstore brand; honestly this is probably the first facial wash i've bought with looking at the ingredients. before i always used to use those men's facial washes and scrubs that had a minty feel, **every day**. probably why i was *so* oily, since i stripping everything off my skin, thinking i was super super clean, though i got very oily maybe 10 mins after i washed it. swapping to this facial wash by simple honestly felt *so* much better. it's  so much gentler on my skin, and it's gel-like and soap free and doesn't tempt me to go HAM on my skin haha. it doesn't make my skin **squeaky** clean, but i do feel clean, y'know? i'd like to experiment with different cleansers, maybe from cosrx; but we'll see after i finish this.

**EXFOLIATOR**

* purifying neem scrub (himalaya herbals) \[depends\]
* BHA blackhead power liquid (cosrx) \[PM\]

**TONER**

* witch hazel and rose water toner (thayers') \[AM/PM\]

**SERUM**

* **niacinimide 10% + zinc 1% (the ordinary) \[PM\]**
   * this is the second serum i've tried from TO, after trying salicylic acid. though the niacinimide zinc serum is said to have the same effect as SA, i feel that the former is more effective for my skin. i used it to reduce PIH and even out the skin tone on my face; as well as a spot treatment if i do break out! i've seen a massive improvement, with the dark spots on my cheek and forehead that were there for many many months, being barely visible.  i look forward to using more products from TO; any recommendations products for fine lines on the forehead would be great heh

**MOISTURISER(s)**

* aloe vera 98% (nature key)
* 100% pure petroleum jelly (vaseline) \[PM\]
   * holy grail. swear by it. i've always hesitated slathering on vaseline on my skin since i was afraid that it'll just be yucky and too thick. but after using it on my once dry undereye and nose area, i've never looked back. i religiously apply it every night above all my other products as an occlusive. also, don't know if it's a placebo effect or what but i've seen an improvement in my dark circles under my eyes too. to make things simpler (for use), i just scoop out a bit from the massive tub and put it in a mini screwcap container.
* chai spice lip balm (hurraw!)

**SUNCARE**

* aloe soothing sun cream (cosrx)
* magic snow sun stick (aprilskin) \[reapplication\]

through my skincare journey i learned that: as a person that used to have excessively oily skin, i feel that my skin needs to be moisturised so that i don't overproduce sebum. i've seen an improvement in the shininess of my face, with fewer breakouts. i really want to try more products but i think it's best to finish this all up first; however long that may take x.x

2: i'm not sure; possibly, i feel like my upper leg/bum is quite wide and bigger in comparison with my lower leg and my waist/hip. are there any brands out there that have denim jeans that are stretchy, but don't look like jeggings? i have a pair already and would like to venture into better denim territory :p

2: also, any tips on finding jeans that don't bunch up awkwardly at the crotch (even when standing up)? i feel like every pair of sturdy denim jeans i've had look very awkward, like there's too much fabric, high waisted or not :( any different styles, or advice on this would be awesome!

currently going through a phase where i'm really unhappy with all the bottoms i have, thinking of making a permanent switch to leggings or dresses but i really want to give other bottoms a chance before i give up! other suggestions on different styles of bottoms would be great too hehehe. TIA! :)"
