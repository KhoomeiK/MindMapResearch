You can't use the extension cable to extend normal USB devices unless you crush the notch with pliers, which takes about 30 seconds.

But this is entirely your perception and has no basis in reality. As an actual young person who knows other young people, we all have or want a good job and a desire to work hard. Some people may *watch* Love Island, but how is that any different from watching Eastenders?

Nobody wants to be a nurse or a teacher because they're shit fucking jobs. Why would anybody want to spend inordinate amounts of money training, only to be routinely abused by members of the public for next to no pay?"

They didn't do this because it would have required a new type rating, poor wording on my part."
cars,ff60332,t1_ff5y98f,1579615643.0,"Everything that happened is entirely Boeings fault, don't beleive their lies, this was a very simple problem that had only one root reason: Making it safe was more expensive and time consuming. They needed that plane out immediately to compete with the Airbus a320neo.

Anything mission critical should be at least doubly redundant, usually triply redundant. This was had no redundancy at all. The fact that it was damaged and badly repaired should have meant nothing, and if there was any redundancy the engineers would have known immediately that they had not sufficiently repaired the vane.

The pilots were trained with a fucking iPad app. Any other aircraft manufacturer making changes of this magnitude would have had to make their pilots get a new type rating to fly it, Boeing decided that wasn't profitable enough so they made a pathetically small training app to sidestep the issue."
