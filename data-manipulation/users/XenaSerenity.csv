trees,fffxt1j,t1_fffufoe,1579894144.0,Same. I do it for chores in the morning. It helps a lot both in focusing and relaxing if that makes sense
AskReddit,ffcfvqf,t3_esr647,1579798577.0,"Cooking. I’m a fantastic cook. I learned from my mom who taught me at a young age. I thought it was because it was something for us to do together but I soon learned it was because otherwise my brother and I would starve as my dad didn’t cook at all. The last time she was gone, we survived off of old Mac and cheese and Tostitos for 3 days and she need to do something. I began cooking for my family at age ten, unfortunately when my mom started too, and I began to loathe it. 


I think she did too because my step dad is an amazing cook. I wanted a guy who did too and luckily I got my husband into cooking! He cooks for us most days and gets very happy when I cook for him."
