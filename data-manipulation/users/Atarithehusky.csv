starwarsmemes,ff6k99w,t3_ery43b,1579628990.0,Love your caption; hilarious. Not so sure the premise of the meme is for sure though. Here's to hoping the reality is this and not a battle scene from attack of the clones or something. :/
GraceAndFrankie,ff48za2,t3_er5w6t,1579558150.0,This would feel contrived to me.

SandersForPresident,ff04iz8,t3_er1c8a,1579465137.0,"Wow! Thank you so much for posting this. I'm looking forward to following these links! I have felt connected to your national/regional values and have been in love with Sweden for quite some time (10 years lol); to the point where I studied the language, watched as many Swedish films as I could, found as much Swedish music as possible, memorized your beautiful national anthem, [and hung a Swedish flag in my bedroom.](https://imgur.com/a/j8boo3v)

This was wonderfully written and reflects the collectivist sentiment we need to survive and thrive. Thank you for your efforts to discuss Bernie in Sweden!"

TheMandalorianTV,fejoo0a,t1_fei3q1z,1579181799.0,"What did you try to make? I've been crocheting for four years or so and I'm not about to try and make this guy! I stick to mostly blankets, but just learned to make some fingerless gloves the other day! If you ever want to give it another try check out the blog ""hooked by robin"" and newstitchaday.com for inspiration, they both offer video tutorials, I solely used those for a while before I could read patterns. I started to learn by just by doing a chain and then row upon row of single crochet. This is a good way to go cause once you're comfortable with the single, many other stitches like the half, the double, and triple, will all seem like a piece of cake. The possibilities are endless!"

aww,fegel85,t3_eotlr4,1579090061.0,I love foxes! Imagine if Todd from Fox and the Hound had made this noise. Even just thinking about that movie makes me feel emotions in my gut. I need to put those back in the box and the box in the closet.

crafts,fegagxr,t1_fedyxl7,1579084901.0,"Damaged doesnt have to be a circumstance love (I've been in a place where I've considered myself that too) and imo former incarceration status shouldn't follow people around forever nor the label of ""criminal"".

HistoryMemes,feg9y6u,t1_fee7ztr,1579084168.0,"It depends on what time we're talking. I referenced the 14th century. At that time the plantation complex was still developing in the Mediterranean and most slaves were not in agricultural labor. By the 17th century however, you're statement about colonialism and South America are accurate I believe. We can check the validity and learn lots of interesting things by going to the [Slave Trade Voyages Database](https://www.slavevoyages.org/)"
