AmItheAsshole,ffi3gh6,t3_etq8zt,1579963976.0,"YTA because you knew he was coming back late and that you were the opposite sex as he was. Your boss told you to move rooms. You then say no and that it's ok. The. You complain and play the female card and get him fired. Now if you were male and complained, would he had been fired? 

>I was intimidated and embarrassed,

You allowed yourself to stay in this situation. Trust me, I'm all about being professional but this poor bloke was fired cause you didn't do what your boss told you to do. Also, your company paid for the ""party"" so they are kinda to blame if they provided the alcohol also."

AmItheAsshole,ffazwdr,t1_ffazsrq,1579748370.0,I highly doubt they bought something collectable. I would buy a Delorean for sure though.
AmItheAsshole,ffaw2h3,t1_ffavzvk,1579745823.0,Yeah. I would invest in property
AmItheAsshole,ffaim3x,t1_ff9oqxo,1579736616.0,Cars are the worst investment you can make. All they do is decrease in value. They could have bought 2 really nice used cars for under $50k and invested the other $70k.

AskReddit,ff0tv2r,t3_er3avv,1579472250.0,I'll speak for myself on this one. Went to the movies today and realized I probably won't see a trailer for a movie that I didn't already know about. I use to love watching the trailer cause of the excitement of the unknown movies coming out.
