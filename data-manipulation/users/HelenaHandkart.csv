Boxing,fe9wbm3,t3_eo4m0t,1578942016.0,"A fair question
1) If you are punching then areas are undefended. That's why some boxers try to get you to throw and miss, opening up counters
2) Throwing and missing is tiring. Some of the greatest defensive boxers (Floyd Mayweather, Lennox Lewis) tire their opponents mentally and physically this way.
3) Throwing multiple punches with good form is harder than it looks. It takes about a year to learn to throw a useful jab. Once you learn to double or triple it you will find yourself with an incredibly useful tool that will win you a lot of fights. But if it's going to be a punch combo that is useful and has some venom behind it, you are doing to have to work on it. Ditto multiple hooks (multiple left hooks are also incredibly powerful but it takes time and skill to learn to throw them in a way that works)"

How do you find such a purpose? First, I'd stay away from Facebook and comparing yourself to the public persona that those people present. I can tell you for sure that the face they present is almost certainly false and, even when true, only part of the story. Most of us struggle to find people we can trust. 
But, we find ourselves naturally becomming friends with those with shared interests. These could be charity work, gaming, sports, a creative hobby.
