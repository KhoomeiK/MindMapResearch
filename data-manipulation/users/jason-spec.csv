spirituality,ff8rn99,t3_es5tyn,1579693352.0,Could you please paste a link from where this is taken from? Thank you! I love it.
vegan,fejngd5,t3_ephyph,1579180752.0,"Interesting story. I'm amazed by what changes you're experiencing, although not surprised much.

Before stating my perspective I must give credit for the good side of medicine. Sometimes people go through horrible accidents and most would not survive if it wasn't for the hospitals. And this is just one example.

As for the doctors, I've heard from time to time people saying the doctor actually gave them some hints about improving their diets, I guess more off the record. Some of them simply are not too aware, because the ""brainwashing"" process they had to go through. Let's be clear, the industry is in the business of making money first of all. They are not interested in redirecting patients to the farmer's market. Other doctors probably know the truth, but I also heard stories about the benefits they are getting from different companies for pushing their products. Again, I'm not making claims. These are merely assumptions and things I've heard from sources that I want to remain a secret. I'm not interested in going to court to prove anything because I probably can't and I don't want to. (I'm saying all this just because I don't know who's reading this and this is a serious matter.)

Blaming the industry for making money is still not the best option. People should be responsible enough to do their own research and make their own observations and take charge of their lives, right?"

getdisciplined,fei4yo9,t1_fehpm7c,1579130389.0,Thank you for the suggestion. I will definitely get this book.
getdisciplined,fei4odw,t1_fei4cgr,1579130208.0,It's like you're describing me not long ago. Except for me it was facebook instead of reddit. I only found out couple of days ago reddit is a much better place for me than facebook.
getdisciplined,fei25lz,t1_fehgtgh,1579128631.0,Thank you for the suggestion. Noted!
getdisciplined,fehys8x,t1_fehu8fo,1579126596.0,Omg. You're so right. It's like life always finds a way to remind to us what we already know but failed to act on it. I really resonate with this.
getdisciplined,fehq8rt,t1_fehq0x9,1579121708.0,Coincidence? :)) more like confirmation I think. I'm glad you want to give it a try. Get it in that flow state.
getdisciplined,fehj5kx,t1_fegw2ie,1579117609.0,"I resonate with everything you said. I come from the background of having a really really busy mind. And this is actually powerful, especially when you get it to work for you. Make it your ally, by disciplining it and focusing it consciously on your craft. For people like you I wanted to write this post in the first place, but I made it more general so more people will benefit. Glad you liked it."
getdisciplined,fehis2y,t1_feh15m9,1579117390.0,"I actually appreciate you noticed that. I was hoping that won't get unnoticed, because I find it really powerful. At least until the process goes to the subconscious mind and becomes automatic."
getdisciplined,fehijjo,t1_fehgwwi,1579117252.0,"Wow thank you for your enthusiasm. I agree with everything you said, and I am happy you are following this path. Just want to make something clear though. I do read a lot. However reading and acquiring knowledge only helped me to acquire knowledge and forget it. Honestly I was kinda disappointed with myself for a long time. It's only when I started being more aware and present that I actually started to observe things on my own. And I'm sure my memory kicked in as well and even if I didn't know how I came up with ideas and practices, some things I probably read somewhere at some point in the past. So I don't really deserve full credit for the knowledge. Applied knowledge however, I guess that's my merit, because I'm the one doing the actual work, and seeing how this works in my life, actually motivated me to spread the word. I also love Karma points :D"
Habits,fegag6e,t1_fega4gn,1579084872.0,Oh thanks. I appreciate this.
spirituality,feernbj,t1_feels56,1579039744.0,"Well my friend, I know what you mean. The quantum physics geeks think everything is random, so they fail to see how everything relates with everything else. They don't know that everything which is above is as everything which is below. They think it only applies on a quantum level, but they fail to see how we are also on some sort of quantum level when you see the big picture of the universe. We are actually as small as the quantum on the whole scale of things, just slightly bigger. I don't actually claim to understand quantum, but I understand enough reality to humble myself in front of the mighty creation and accept that I don't know what I don't know, instead of assuming everything is black or white."
spirituality,fee44wz,t3_eoobn4,1579026007.0,"I actually read this twice. Really enlightening book. Also ""You are placebo"" is a very good one."
vegan,fee3z10,t1_febs4bc,1579025909.0,I understand why you felt this way :D
vegan,fee3x2p,t1_febjt69,1579025877.0,"Thank you. I hope you find ease in doing this. But if you succeed and I hope you do, try to stay away from going into useless arguments with the masses. Just my experience :D"
vegan,fee3j0j,t1_fedi21d,1579025648.0,"Infinite waters actually, but close :D"
spirituality,febfw6k,t1_febelpv,1578958388.0,"Yes. I reached the same conclusion, the hard way it's true but I get it. Our soul will always find a way to make us aware of what we need to see, thankfully."
spirituality,febbgdx,t3_eobef1,1578957133.0,"If you want to go about it spiritually, don't waste your energy. Take it back from facebook, take it back from the people and circumstances you're constantly thinking about, taking back from past events that you feel guilty about. Really reflect on this. Center yourself, take your life force back."
spirituality,febasgb,t3_eobef1,1578957010.0,"I actually been through this and it was quite depressing. Now keep in mind that some of your habits that I never had can do this to you, but this is what I started to do and it works for me.

First make sure you are never thirsty, or at least keep your body hydrated. This will help you on many other levels. I mean it. Do this. Nothing spiritual about it. We're just made of water, mostly. You need this.

Secondly. Instead of sleeping 12 hours try being aware of the sleep cycles. Find a sleep cycle calculator on google. Insert the time you want to wake up and it will show you when to go to bed. Usually a sleep cycle is about 1.3 h long, so you want to wake up when a cycle ends instead of in the middle of it.

Third take cold showers even if it's for 10 seconds at first.

Four start eating healthier. Don't necessarily force yourself, but add something healthy in your diet every day, incrementally, progressively.  
Exercise. Again start with a few minutes a day, so you ego will not resist it. 

DON'T give up. We live in a progressive reality so don't expect this to vanish the first day. Just keep doing this. Just by forcing yourself out of your comfort zone each day you will feel more fulfilled without the added benefit of each habit that I mentioned. Good luck.

EDIT: you can worry about your chakras but give this a try first, it's easier and more practical."
spirituality,feb121q,t1_feb0l64,1578954381.0,Beautiful thank you. You just brought myself back again.
spirituality,feawrcz,t1_feaocog,1578952982.0,"Thank you! I very much agree with you. I tried psychedelics 7 times in the past and I had enlightening experiences. I found myself in those moments. Later I fell back into the old patterns. I am in a good place right now however, that's why I found no resistance in being completely open about what I've been through :) I'm actually proud of me for doing this, but humble at the same time."
spirituality,fe6y98z,t3_enzy0o,1578907704.0,"You are polarizing the ego. The ego is your entire personality range, not just what you described. I can strive to be the first doctor in my family or open the first non profit organization for volunteers. This is still the ego, the persona, your act."
books,fe6wu63,t3_enub8m,1578906955.0,I would always choose reading over any other hobby.
spirituality,fe1zanf,t3_enjna0,1578832659.0,"You are exactly where you're supposed to be right now my friend. You've hit rock bottom and you've surrendered. You haven't surrendered control, you've surrendered to the control that's already built in. To God. The only way is up from here on. Time to man up an start rebuilding from scratch. This experience you're going through is here to teach you something. And you have God by your side and nothing can threaten you."
books,fdp2wsu,t3_emhb0u,1578618721.0,For me it was The Power of Now.
spirituality,fdox5gv,t3_emb1go,1578614898.0,Our lives are not predestined in the way you think. We also have free will. Put this into the equation.
spirituality,fdow74f,t3_emhh8g,1578614272.0,"Please don't fear anything. I was born a Christian and never really had any deep feeling of connection with anything, until I found spirituality. My life changes in so many ways. I finally found who I am and I also experienced deep connections with God. I receive signs everyday and when I follow the signs Everything works so smoothly in my life. Just trust your heart and not your fears. And don't take Bible so literally ."
spirituality,fdorz8d,t3_e00axj,1578611563.0,"Beautiful post. Thank you for the recommendations.

This is what I like

A new Earth - Eckhart Tolle;
A course in Miracles;
The Celestine Prophecy; 
The Ra Material;
Bashar Blueprint for change."
