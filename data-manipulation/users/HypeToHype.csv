Because if God does something wrong to someone/something, it might seem wrong. But there may be a reason behind why God did that, in a way that makes things not bad. Not all bad is just pure bad, some bad can turn to good, some good can turn to bad. Also, who is to say what we percieve to be as bad in God's eyes, vice versa. Life is the full experience, if it was all just good, we wouldn't experience things fully.
