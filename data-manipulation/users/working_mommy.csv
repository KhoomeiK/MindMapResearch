To force your bridesmaids and groomsmen into this try of shot is beyond tacky. It looks incredibly forced, and no one looks like they are enjoying it."
ontario,ff7ol8h,t1_ff7it3t,1579654552.0,Thank you so much for your thorough response. It coincides with both my thinking and what I could find online.
LifeProTips,ff7kut8,t1_ff7h5dx,1579651949.0,"This works well. My SO isnt bald yet, and if you look at the males in his family it's a 50/50 bet if he will go bald. But there is hair thinning, and the start of a rescinding hair line, so odds are he will end up bald. 

 He keeps it trimmed short, so unless you know to look for it,you wouldn't know he is going to be bald. He is well aware he will be bald at some point. The buzz cut just gives him that transition period."

To be fair it has been almost 10 years ago so maybe they just couldn't remember. But the telling/scary response, was the guy who said, ""there is an emergency shut off?"" This guy worked at a gas station for 2 years, and had no idea there was an emergency shut off."
IdiotsInCars,fe5v63r,t1_fe5tq3a,1578875669.0,"If you watch the video she was looking for the emergency stop, and asking for help. 

Seeing this video months ago made we start looking for the emergency shut off. It is amazing how it is not always visible at every gas station. Hell at one place I couldn't find it. I asked the attendant, and they didnt know. Told me they'd have to look in their procedures book."
camping,fe5edmj,t3_entkla,1578868346.0,"I second the hobo dinner. Its quick, its easy, and its tasty. 
 
 We have also made ""philly cheese steak"", (I use that name loosely here), and get rave reviews from friends. 
Loaf of bread, sliced roast beef (for easy we go deli sliced roast beef) sauted onions and pepper, mozzarella cheese. Cut loaf in half lengthwise, assemble like a sandwich. Wrap in tin foil. Cook over hot coals (or use a bbq) about 15 min or until heated through. Generally served with chips, or a salad. 

 My son and his friends make pizza rolls when they camp. Pillsbury pizza dough, pizza sauce and toppings of your choice. Roll out dough, add sauce and toppings, roll up dough and pinch off ends. Wrap in tinfoil, and cook for about 20-30 min over hot coals (or again use bbq). I am told make sure you spray your foil with Pam if you make this."

 The final straw was after dinner one night, cheque paid. Each put a tip on the table. She said she had to go to the washroom, I said I'd meet her at the car. Look over as I'm about to walk out the door, and she is putting the tip money in her wallet. Ya, I made her put it back, and never ever went out to eat with her again."

camping,fdqueum,t3_emrw2l,1578675065.0,"I took my oldest at 8 months, and my youngest at 4 months. At the time of the oldest my SO and I were disperse campers. The amount of baby stuff and extra clothes, blankets etc you have to pack is nuts. We ended up taking both our vehicles because I was afraid we would need something I forgot. I also found not having any amenities with a child that young super stressful, so the next time we went camping we went to a provincal park so we had access to electric on site, and were walking distance to water taps, and washrooms/showers. That in itself made the whole trip less stressful and more enjoyable. We probably continued to camp that way until the youngest was around 8 or 9.

Last summer I took my sister, my 1.5 year old and 6 week old nephews camping. For the first time ever we went ""glamping"" at a KOA. Having power, and water on site was great. My sister appreciated the laundry facilities at the campground, so she could wash the kids clothes if they ran out, or they got dirty. Plus most KOA's are close to a town in case you do forget something. 

All and all it is doable. It really depends on what your comfort level is with a child that young, and what you're willing to comprise with when it comes to whatever your version of camping is now, and what makes it easiest with a baby."

dogs,fdijaa6,t1_fdi90w8,1578444169.0,"This is so true. When our dog who passed last year was about 3, I was volunteering at a shelter. We had a litter of pups, and I feel in love with one, so home she came. My older dog loved her. Was a giant help in training her, but once the pup got past the age of 2, she became indifferent to having another dog in the house. Sadly the pup ended up with cancer and passes at 4 years. My older? Didnt even phase her. I actually think she was happier being the only dog."
ontario,fdihs3r,t1_fdi9vgi,1578443212.0,"So my kids are both basically adults, so my lice info may be out dated, but when an outbreak happened in my kids school, and I found one in a kids hair I went and did the treatments. Next notice, we would find something on the other kid. Same deal. That shit gets expensive. 

After about the 3rd or 4th notice I called our health unit. I was told that clean hair is easier for the lice to jump onto and cling on. Their advice was to skip hair washing. Do it every other day or every 3rd day. 

My kids tended to get dirty so I wasnt willing to do 3 days, but I switched to every other day. I no longer saw lice when those notices came home.

Again, this info may be 10 years outdated. Just letting you know what worked for us."

puppy101,fdigegm,t3_eliosq,1578442315.0,"I love reading successful stories on here. 

Did you use any type of harness with him, or just a leash clipped to his collar? I myself have a 7 month pup who, with just a leash attached to his collar could drag myself or my 17yr old daughter if something caught his eye when he got to be about 5 months old. No amount of commands of offers of treats would be good enough to overcome whatever he wanted. 

Last month I bought one of those harnesses that the leash clips to the front, so if they pull they end up turning back to you. So the pup no longer pulls, but for me it's not a long term solution. Any insight to your methods would be appreciated."

I get when looking for a job we are applying to many. But seriously, once contacted for an interview, who in the hell walks into a job  interview not knowing who it is for?  I'm sure this happens but jeez. 

Last time I was looking for work and scheduled an interview, at the bare minimum I'd be checking out their website for more info, and to gain insight for any questions I should be asking. 

Or maybe their thought process is that if they look like they are so busy interviewing at places they cant get them straight. 

Sorry for long reply. I was literally trying to work out why someone would do this as I typed."
dogs,fdi7wa9,t3_eli36z,1578437322.0,"I just laughed until I cried. 

Our last dog was a German Shepherd/Collie cross, and we had this exact same situation play out numerous times with her (minus an audience). She was the most well behaved, polite dog ever, until a decent sized stick was involved. After that all training went out the window, and even at 14 a stick would make her behave like a puppy again. 

Thanks for the happy memories."
dogs,fdbqws9,t3_ekhs25,1578260463.0,"You are seeing this via social media, so do you know if they are actual service dogs, or just people claiming they are service dogs? Having a vest on doesnt prove anything anymore. You can buy those off of any number of websites. 

I have 2 friends with service dogs. (One as a sight dog, another for epilepsy). They have voiced their concerns about this trend of claiming a dog is a service dog. Not so much my blind friend, since that one is obvious, but the one with epilepsy says he brings his dogs papers with him everywhere, because these people that abuse the system have made it very difficult for anyone without a visable disability to bring their dogs into most places."

To my knowledge HIV testing can be done via blood test. Yes your white cell count being off can indicate cancer, it is not the deciding factor. Your cell count being off could be contributed to many things. 

You cant sit there and compare HIV to cancer testing. They are vastly different. It's like comparing apples to oranges."

onguardforthee,fc1iu3i,t3_efn8o9,1577320061.0,"I refuse to defend Tim Horton's since I'm not a fan. But my kid works her first part time job there, and my sister was a general manager for an owner who owned 5 stores that she over saw.   

 Unless they are a corporate store, hours depend on the franchise owners. My kids store closed at 3pm Christmas Eve and wont open until 7am Boxing day. They close at the same time New Years eve, but I think its 4am start on Jan 2nd. When my sister worked there, the owners she worked for held basically the same christmas schedule. And for both my sisters employeer and my kids, the rule was if you worked Christmas eve, you didnt work New Years eve. It's still not ideal, but it is the service industry, so I will say it's fairly normal.

You cant fault a whole company, because you saw one franchise owner who is an asshole. 

. Ha. I ended up defending Tim's anyway."
