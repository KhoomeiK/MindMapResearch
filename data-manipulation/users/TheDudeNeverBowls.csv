One table were Hasidic Jews, another was an Indian family, another were some world ranked Squash players from I don’t know where, and another was an Asian couple. Everyone was completely nice, engaging, and just all around good people.

It’s always just been something servers said as part of the lingo. Literally in the likes of terms like in the weeds, 86’d, cut, big top, and side work. Not saying it’s right, because it’s not and it’s not something I would ever personally say, just that everywhere I heard it, it was just a figure of speech. 

Then again, I grew up in the part and time of the south where a white middle schooler would routinely refer to a group of black kids as niggas without even the slightest thought of there being anything wrong. 

Eh, casual racism has been such a huge part of my entire life that I don’t even really pay attention to it until something like this makes me stop and think about it."

Entrepreneur,ffg983v,t3_etawai,1579901189.0,"I like the podcast ad agency. It would need to be really cheaply done but be extremely smart at targeting audiences. 

For example, there are dozens of podcasts for science fiction shows like Star Trek and The Expanse and the like. Find a product that targets those fans and those fans exactly and hit all the podcasts. Most are run by regular people who would happily take a few dollars every week to run a really short ad. 

I think that’s the problem with ads on podcasts now. They are local places advertising on one podcast. Eventually they stop because they get no returns. But if a product/service becomes ubiquitous on as many podcasts as possible, then it becomes the next Casper. (I mention them because they did exactly this)."

TheExpanse,fffxet9,t1_fff5j63,1579893900.0,"If you were to start at book five now, without reading the other books, you’d be quite lost. Sure, a lot of the bigger plot points will be there, but so much is so different. Even the characters you know and love are quite different than their show counterparts. 

Reading the books will be like watching the same show but in a parallel universe that is far far deeper than the show you just watched. Or actually, it’s more like a friend telling you the story of what happened last night because you were so hammered that you blacked out. Like, they’re telling you of all the amazing things you did, but you don’t remember. But then, one day a perfect recall comes to you and you remember every single beat. This suddenly becomes the best night of your life once you remember it all. The story your friend told you has all the beats, but he’d obviously glossed over the meat and potatoes of what happened.

I understand what you mean. I’m so happy to be where we are with this show. I know how great the books are, but I was one of those who was not very happy with season one. 

But then I looked at my own personal history with watching television. Internal conflict is what television does right. I watch the first two seasons often in order to remind myself of this. These episodes weren’t written for me. They were written for the guy who watches television and came across a good television show. 

It doesn’t matter what I want.  What matter is what plays. Naren Shankar wrote the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode, The First Duty. He was show runner on the original CSI for several years. Dude knows television. And he knows enough to surround himself with people who also know television.
