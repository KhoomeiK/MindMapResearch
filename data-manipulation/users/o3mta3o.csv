aww,ffknskg,t3_eu3uh5,1580025816.0,"I had a friend who was a bit of an dim bulb who decided to get a snake. He would act like an idiot and hand feed the thing all the time. Snakes aren't exactly the brightest creatures on the planet so if they see you feeding them they can't differentiate between you bringing the food and you being the food. Anyways, any time he got near the snake it would look at him like this. It got to the point where he couldn't handle the snake anymore because any time he reached in to the cage the snake would try to eat him."
aww,ffkmlwm,t1_ffkl927,1580025249.0,Maybe? But don't underestimate that people would spend beyond their means for a status symbol. You see it from time to time with a kid that buys a BMW used and can't afford to do any maintenance on the thing.

We were getting our CPR updated and the usual woman we use went into labor that morning and ended up having to call in someone last minute to do it. She must not have told him anything about where he was going because at one point he tells us ""just call 911 and put the phone down, they'll find you"" and we all freaked out. Like, NO!

They don't need your money, but they'd like to get it. Where as a credit union is smaller and has a vested interest in people not  taking out huge sums of money. I mean, an argument could really be made either way, but when my father in law died and my man was left dealing with the estate, the banks had everything signed and closed within a month, and that was because of us waiting on other places to do their final deposits.
