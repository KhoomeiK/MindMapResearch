AskReddit,ffa69ek,t1_ffa4fm1,1579728698.0,Hey! Skyline's veggie chilli is good! Sometimes I even get a veggie 3-way instead of regular because I like it. (my sister is a vege who turned me onto it) UDF shakes are delicious. I suppose we have common ground after all. Though Graeters is superior (much more expensive too)
AskReddit,ff9scg0,t1_ff8s15e,1579720160.0,"we had this rule too, and most people's solution was to keep their slapping hand glued to their forehead to be primed at all times. We looked like a circle of specially-abled kids saluting eachother."
AskReddit,ff9biui,t1_ff8hnfx,1579709196.0,I feel like it was more awkward for the parents. Strangers will laugh when a little kid is weird to them. Parents turn red and try to corral their child away.

AskReddit,fen8btq,t1_femivp7,1579279179.0,"There's laws in the US that the getaway driver is as guilty as anyone else in the group. If you're the getaway driver for a group that robs someone, you're guilty of robbery. If the group murders someone, you're a murderer.   


Not defending the policy, just explaining. I think a lot of people were using it as an excuse ""I didn't kill anyone! I was just the driver! I wasn't even involved"""
AskReddit,fehuzcp,t1_feh3wuw,1579124395.0,"Barely. There was absolutely no background work done on that. They just threw it in because they felt they had to. It was not planned ahead of time. Maybe if JJ Abrams had directed the second one it would have been foreshadowed (that is, if he actually had a plan in the first place), but as it stands now, it was a pathetic attempt to put some closure on that storyline."

AskReddit,fegr5t0,t1_feeqxee,1579100601.0,"I've heard Philadelphia is pretty german too. Cincinnati is incredibly german. We have a whole area of the town called ""Over the Rhine"" because you used to have to cross a river to get to it. There are several German societies where people hang out and do German-ish things (like sing German songs, drink German beer, and speak German). A lot of people (including me) have Dirndls and Lederhosen that they break out for the various German events around the city (ie Octoberfest and Bock fest). I even heard in WW1 Cincinnati got in trouble for playing the German national anthem and in general there was much less support for the war here. People pretty much outright rebelled when they tried to ban sauerkraut in WW2."
