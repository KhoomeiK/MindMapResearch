AmItheAsshole,ff8ruav,t1_ff8d6eg,1579693594.0,We had a patient with a bleach allergy have an anaphylactic reaction after she thought she had been exposed to bleach. Her O2 sats plummeted and she ended up getting intubated and send to the ICU. There was never any bleach in the room. Brains are incredible!
GenderCritical,ff5k4g0,t1_ff5jezw,1579596688.0,"I suspected as much but am nonetheless sorry to hear that. 

I wonder a lot what the root of this issue is. Have there always been so many people who felt this way, and it is only now that they have the support and medical means to take action on it? Or are there a greater proportion of dysphoric people today than there were in the past? 

What do you think an appropriate solution to dysphoria is? I empathize with the experience of dysphoria; my personal objection is to co-opting female identities as the solution."
GenderCritical,ff5jd65,t1_ff5isf4,1579595610.0,"Thank you! I sense some defensiveness in your reply. Please understand that I am not questioning your experience; just seeking to understand it. I am a little less extreme than many folks on this sub, but overall my views align more closely with gender crit/4th wave feminism than libfem. There are other questions I'd love to ask, but if it makes you uncomfortable, I'll refrain."

dementia,feyw85f,t1_fevm8r1,1579451229.0,Healthcare worker here--I agree with having your mom checked out for a UTI or constipation. She may be acting this way due to an actual urge to go that cannot be fulfilled.
dementia,feqe2z8,t1_fbya14y,1579340724.0,"Regardless of your reasons, your refusal to ask for help is going to really begin to hurt you in a matter of months or years. Refusing to acknowledge your cognitive limitations will not make those limitations any less of a reality. As I said before, as your conditions progresses it will become increasingly difficult for you to develop skills to cope with your dementia. And then you will be stuck. You have the ability to change now. This is an opportunity and a gift. Please take it. 

I wish I could offer better advice on how to cope with and accept your diagnosis, but our contact is limited to the internet, and I am not a trained psychologist. Have you considered seeking assistance from a mental health counselor? Maybe you can ask your doctor to refer you to a psychologist who specializes in dementia or disability. 

I'm truly sorry to be harsh. As I said, I see this at work all the time. I always wonder, what if someone had told them that this would happen? Would they have gotten help while they still could? So, I am telling you, because I don't meet my patients until they are already too far gone. 

I'm replying to this 3 weeks later because I have thought of you many times over the past couple of weeks. I have a very unhappy patient tonight who reminded me of you. I wish you the best, my friend. Please seek professional support."
LifeProTips,feqcz10,t1_feqc8wq,1579340261.0,"Oh cool! I've heard of one of those books before, and the author of the other, but haven't read them myself. I'll have to take a look! Thanks (:"
LifeProTips,feqbnvj,t1_feohc5k,1579339863.0,"I love your terminology! I've never before heard the phrase ""creating opportunities for empathy"" but it so accurately reflects how I strive to live my life....thank you!"
relationship_advice,feflmzl,t1_fefa38r,1579058963.0,"Hey, I'm also a six foot female and I relate so hard to this. People act like it's a shallow-ness issue, and maybe on some level it is--but I've TRIED dating men shorter than me and it just makes me feel like such crap, it isn't worth it. Even outside of others being judgmental, I've spent so much of my life feeling large and I don't want my bf to be yet another reminder of how damn big I am. I get by by not thinking about it, rather than being genuinely OK with it. 

I also had an ED and though I am long recovered, I think a lot of it stemmed from being an oversized woman and just wanting to be smaller overall. Unfortunately you can't starve away femurs, but by golly did I try to! The thing about being this tall....EVERYTHING about you is bigger than other women. At the peak of my ED I weighed similar to you and I was still wore a size medium. It drove me absolutely bonkers. I was so skinny that people would comment on it because I frankly looked sick....and I STILL was not considered ""small"" by female standards. Fucking bullshit, haha."
AskReddit,fecydya,t1_fecjdqs,1578989736.0,"I work in healthcare and am always fascinated by patients in similar situations to your dad. Was caring for a quadriplegic guy with a big ol' playboy bunny tattoo the other day, and all I could think was, sure didn't cross your mind that one day a nurse half your age'd be wiping your butt when you got got that tattoo. 

To clarify I also have a lot of empathy for folks like that. It's one hell of a harsh lesson."
GenderCritical,febsq1t,t1_fe943sa,1578962243.0,"I have been sexually assaulted by a woman, but the sheer number of men who have done inappropriate things to me is still so staggering that I feel more cautious around men as a whole. The way that men treat women is a systemic issue, not an issue of individual moral failing. THAT is what makes things different to me."
AmItheAsshole,feanvrq,t1_fe9xisv,1578950695.0,"I worked for a small retail business for 8 years and I would definitely go out of my way to return money to a customer who had overpaid. When people were overcharged on our CC machine, we always corrected the mistake in their favor."
trashy,feaa9nr,t1_fe9ugva,1578946216.0,"Seattle has more homeless people in Portland, but Portland's homeless are more aggressive panhandlers on average. They'll give you shit if you don't give them money and continue to badger you after you say no. I've only had that happen to me in Seattle two times, and I grew up in the heart of the city and lived/worked downtown for 8 years. It's happened to me in Portland a couple times as well, but I've spent maybe two weeks there cumulatively."

todayilearned,fdwnlbn,t1_fdwcdqm,1578760540.0,"It's incredible how much we DON'T know about the body. A muscle in the knee was newly discovered less than a decade ago! Amazing given that humankind has been studying muscles for more than a thousand years.

AmItheAsshole,fd6nyxd,t1_fd63dae,1578193620.0,"Lol, it is honestly routine for me. Like 30% of our patients are actively violent. This one was angry cause we were involintarily administering benzos despite him being ""sober"" from them (self admittedly, for less than 24 hours and he tested positive for them when he came in). I think they did change up his scrip the next day though."
AmItheAsshole,fd5a45i,t1_fd4v63w,1578175598.0,"John Doe is used for ALL unidentified individuals, not just dead ones. I know this cause I work with a lot of psych patients and many of them don't want their names public, so they go by John (or Jane) Doe on our tracking board. Or they go by that cause they won't tell us their name, lol.

Jokes,fc7s7bg,t1_fc7kgwd,1577517279.0,"So true! Dementia patients are no different, except in that they may not recall the circumstances that influenced their mood. I suspect that this contributes to their decreased capacity for emotional regulation."

There are certain consistencies within a dementia patient's personality, but their agreeability/persistence can vary significantly moment-to-moment and those things would probably influence the outcome of the bargain."
