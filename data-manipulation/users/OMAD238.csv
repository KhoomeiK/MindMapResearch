If this isn't the single greatest line I have ever read in this sub, I don't know what is."
tifu,ff3qutd,t1_ff3ffs9,1579546886.0,My colleagues and bosses and I freely swear all the time. It's in every other sentence. It's totally normal where I am

I don't even know a Jean and my phone does it."

BasicBulletJournals,ff31kve,t1_ff0hu3q,1579531251.0,I figured it fit here because there's very minimal (none at all) art done by hand..
exmuslim,ff2ge3c,t1_ff1li6l,1579504997.0,Fair enough. You could do some media work on the side for sure :)

exmuslim,fezsnma,t1_fezs7p9,1579461141.0,"We are in very similar boats it seems. I hope your partner finds freedom with you, and I hope mine opens his mind just a little more.

I can't complain though. It's a process, especially if they feel like their partner is changing or feeling differently. Baby steps though. Like he hated the idea of me drinking alcohol, now he doesn't care that I drink as long as it's not in front of him. 

Baby steps."
nothingeverhappens,fez9a70,t3_eqx2bw,1579455034.0,This happens a whole lot.. I got asked out and my husband got the apology when he realised I was with him
BasicBulletJournals,feyy8k0,t3_epoweq,1579451929.0,Yes that's exactly what I do :D
childfree,feywplz,t3_eqti5g,1579451481.0,"Seriously. Those of us that have decided not to have kids have actually thought a LOT more about the implications, pros/cons, and potential complications (and the actual facts/potential outcomes) of pregnancy and childbirth, and having children in general."
tifu,feyujzo,t1_feymjl3,1579450702.0,"Better thanks :) 

Yes the first time was an ovarian cyst (10cm) and the second time was a 20cm ovarian cyst. The first left me with some of my ovary and the second took my ovary and tube with it"

exmuslim,feydsxl,t3_eqq6mn,1579444221.0,"Decide if you're ready. He sounds like he is, are you? It may feel like it's the next step but it is a big step for your first time. 

The mind is a powerful thing. You will get there as soon as you let your mind be free. 

Have fun, be safe :)"
exmuslim,feycmc9,t3_eqisdi,1579443798.0,"What does ""habashi"" mean?"

exmuslim,feyb0qh,t1_fey9oju,1579443151.0,"You will get there, I promise. You need to make sure you're financially stable before you do anything else. 

Anything else will just result in you getting more shit from them"
exmuslim,feyakx6,t1_fey9jv2,1579443032.0,"I'm married to a non religious Muslim. My mum has apologised to me for not protecting me as a kid/teen (she did try) and my dad acts like nothing happened (I was a victim of a paedophile in mosque when I was 9 and my dad struggled to help bring the guy to justice because ""he is a Muslim and it's not nice to disrespect your teacher"" but we got there eventually.. when I was 18). 

You're not overly sensitive, you're not being dramatic. Your feelings are valid and you didn't/don't deserve any of the bullshit you're being handed. 

I completely understand that and I'm so sorry that they are interfering like this in your life. They are aware of your boyfriend's existence, this is good right? My advice to you is take each day as it comes, I know it's really hard. But it'll be worth it. Finish your studies, get a good job, save up. Don't leave until you're financially stable and do not rely on anyone else, okay? Be prepared to go it alone no matter how certain you are that you won't be. Just be steady for yourself first and always."
exmuslim,fey9s5s,t1_fexsf71,1579442671.0,"Oof if this doesn't resonate with me. My husband was religious when I married him. We were both semi religious when we got together and then became super religious and thought we would increase our closeness with God through each other. We did for a while. 

Now I'm not religious at all and he is clinging on to the thread of ""I believe. I'm not religious and don't follow most of the rules but I believe and that is enough"".

Suppose we'll get there."
bulletjournal,fey9fke,t1_fey7shy,1579442489.0,Thank you! I've lost a lot of my creative flair and doing this has brought some of it back. Thanks for saying this
exmuslim,fey9be8,t1_fey15u6,1579442436.0,"Unfortunately it's easy to say ""report your dad"" but there is so much potential backlash that it is terrifying to do so. I agree that he is dangerous, but the consequences of doing something like that could mean OP ends up being targeted. She needs to tread it carefully. He needs to be locked up but the possibility of this is not as high as it seems."
exmuslim,fey8val,t3_eqvp28,1579442251.0,"Hold on.. it eventually gets better. You'll get out and you can still keep your relationship with them if you want to. 

My dad beat me black and blue when I was 12, to the point where it was painful to move. It was because I had been talking to a boy. There's a lot to that story but I still flinch when someone raises their voice at me or if someone raises their hand/something in my direction. 

I completely see where you're coming from, please be careful. How old are you? Do you see yourself able to leave in the coming year or so?"
exmuslim,fey7rkm,t3_eqqy1h,1579441894.0,"Yeah I was told this about anklets and bangles and whatever else jingles. I will wear a belt of bells if I fucking want to, let the men look at me. All they'll think is ""what the fuck"""
exmuslim,fey7l44,t3_eqqzo9,1579441814.0,Yup. I'm 26 and I go to workout wearing leggings. That is not okay at all and I genuinely cannot let my parents see me wearing them outdoors because *it's not modest*
exmuslim,fey6lb8,t3_eqt0t0,1579441389.0,"Yeah it's annoying when people think you do things purely to hurt them or piss on their faith. I drink alcohol because I want to, not because it pisses people off. It's such a narcissistic way of thinking"
exmuslim,fey5vdz,t1_feu6gwo,1579441240.0,Maybe one day you can pursue it?
exmuslim,fey5cmh,t3_eoqgnn,1579441020.0,I have always wanted to work with animals. My parents have fully supported my dreams and studies to go on and work in specialist hospitals where I primarily work with dogs.

tifu,fexea0g,t1_fewgzgz,1579429593.0,Yeah my ovarian torsion was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. And I've had my fair share of painful experiences.
