personalfinance,fcsugrz,t3_eip55g,1577925409.0,"Please shop around. Origination fees are usually 1%.  I think the other points you are being quoted is to buy down your interest rate. I cannot understand why you are being quoted so much.  Go to a Mortgage Broker - not a bank. Brokers handle many mortgages from different places and can do the leg work for you. Banks only have a few kinds. A Credit Union is also a good place to get a loan from.

Have you gotten a quote form your current mortgage holder? Sometimes they can do the best deal on  a refi - as that is what you are doing - refinancing - with no appraisal.

Please do not go to Wells Fargo - they've been voted the worst bank of the year."
