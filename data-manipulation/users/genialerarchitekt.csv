Carrying the shopping won't give you muscles though. I know cos that's my excuse for exercise.
dataisbeautiful,fegpno2,t1_fegm5hq,1579099567.0,"That's exactly what used to happen. And radio stations used to control the playlists. In the 80s in Australia we effectively had a radio cartel. All the networks around the country collaborated with the major labels. They pretty much had a chokehold on what got into the Top 40 and what sank without a trace. It wasn't until 1990 when the public youth broadcaster Triple J went national that ""alternative"" music started charting."

dataisbeautiful,fegop22,t1_fegjdgz,1579098891.0,"Back then (mid 80s for me) you quickly learned to avoid albums with filler crap especially as the average cost of one was about AU$35 in 2020 dollars. A lot of money for a teenager. If you bought an album you knew what you were getting. Occasionally I'd take a punt, eg I bought Floodland by The Sisters of Mercy purely on the strength of the cover and loved the album so much, they became my favourite act for a few years. We had 7"" & 12"" singles if you knew the rest of the album wasn't much good. But the main source of music was radio. I had a collection of around 100 cassettes at one point with songs recorded off the radio. I wouldn't go back to those days but it is true that back then getting a new album was a really big deal, you'd listen to it for months, end up learning every lyric if it was a good one or by your favourite band."

askgaybros,feez73n,t1_feekdh5,1579044458.0,"You can use your looks to avoid growing up and dealing with the stuff you need to deal with for quite a while.

I've found euthanasia to be cheap. It's ranged between $10 - $50. Most vets don't charge a lot because with rats it's a fairly simple procedure: they are totally anaesthetized until comatose with isoflurane gas and then injected into the heart with a solution that stops the heart. It's all over in 5 - 10 minutes. 

I've read up on best practice for euthanizing rats and the vets I've been to have always followed best practice."
RATS,fee0b6d,t3_eolqup,1579023684.0,"Q1 If you have any health concerns there's only one thing that will ease your anxiety, take him to the vet. Always take rats to the vet as soon as you think something's off, don't wait until your rat is obviously sick. Something I learned the hard way.

Q2 Cage looks fine. Same as what I have. You could keep up to 4 in there and they'd thrive.

Q3 I find bonding just happens spontaneously over time. There's nothing special you have to do except spend lots of time with them. Rats have very varied personalities, some are cuddly but lots aren't. I've had 10 males and I'd say only 1 was truly cuddly in that he'd just sit still on me, go to sleep on me, trust me to pick him up in one hand etc. All of those things are instinctively very scary for rats so it's fine if your rats don't do these things. Not every rat wants to be an Instagram star. I find after about 2 months or so you just one day realize there's this deep connection of trust & affection between you and your rats, it's hard to put into words, but you'll know it when it happens. I don't understand why your boyfriend would be any problem? Rats can bond with as many people as want to bond with them.

Q4 The way I've always introduced rats is to let them meet in a neutral space like a bathtub or my bed and see how they get along. If there's no aggression after 45 minutes things should be okay. You will need a separate enclosure of some kind at first. Just casually moving a new rat into another rat's home is extremely stressful for the new rat (another lesson I learnt the hard way) and can easily trigger illness and infection. Ideally, Let them spend a few more sessions getting to know each other. If everything goes well you need to totally clean out the cage from top to bottom. Everything must go. New nestboxes, food bowls etc etc. There should be no hint of any scent left of the rat whose home it's been. Then you can place them together. It's not as scary as I thought it would be. I've done 5 introductions and only had minor issues with one. With the others, no issues at all. Having two cages makes life a lot easier though.

Q5 I know everyone says rats should never be alone but I'd say rats shouldn't be alone *long-term*, ie for months and months on end. Even then, being alone won't kill the rat as long as they have food and water and lots of love and attention from a human. Sometimes life just deals you a crappy hand. Best buddies get old and die. Like humans, rats are great at adapting to their environment. Being alone for a month or two won't hurt your rat."
RATS,fedza2s,t3_eombe4,1579023034.0,I have 4 males but don't really notice any smell at all. I clean out the nest boxes daily and change the litter every 3-4 days. Maybe I don't notice coz I'm a male too haha.

WorkOnline,fea6grh,t3_eo7mdo,1578944898.0,"Yes totally. I've been teaching English online as my main job for the last 14 years and I've become a total hermit in that time. I've come to dislike interacting with people IRL and feel that I've become steadily worse at it which makes me anxious if I have to do it. Most of the time these days, I just interact with my partner. I'm pretty sure a psychologist would happily diagnose me with ""social anxiety disorder"" or something like that. Working online can be really isolating unless you have measures in place."
