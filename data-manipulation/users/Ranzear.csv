Take your pick. I've used both now and prefer the former for being more transparent and zero cruft.

Basically, any flavor of linux you want on a headless server basically anywhere useful in the world for $5-500 a month depending on cores/memory/storage you need, but you can resize any time just be sure to keep the disk allocation small. No restrictions (beyond the sensible), no support (you break it, you fix it, though you do have nice backdoors).

If you're shipping whole servers around, though, you might be at a different scale. I've gotten up to 112 cores clustered (7x 16c/64gb) but any more than seven nodes starts to push the Galera overhead too high, even over private IP in the same datacenter. Galera (MariaDB's multi-master clustering) is likely a different beast from what you're used to as well. All nodes are master and confirm transactions independently, so you *can* use locking but it's 'optimistic' and will roll back and error if you conflict with a different node on commit, which your app should handle gracefully (even assuming you aren't 99% autocommit). With it, though, all your reads and effectively your writes are local so in high rate i/o applications it rocks.

Virtual Hosts are basically the middle ground betweeen running your own hardware and app-only deployment like AWS Lambda. Both of these services are far older than AWS actually, it's just a bit too involved for most while I have my own workarounds like a central LDAP auth for all my nodes.

So I mean, yeah, if your app pegged everything it's probably the app, but rescaling a virtual host is trivial.

HA would just be using linode's own loadbalancers (admittedly I've pegged one of these, 10k concurrent connection limit) but I'm not unfamiliar with a swarm of small nodes in the DNS all running haproxy and health checking of app nodes, and fault tolerance from using Galera for a clustered DB backend. Every node is the complete app and will join/leave the cluster freely. I like Galera clustering for locality, directly on the app node, so long as you pin clients to a node effectively.

Who said that? Oh **you** did elsewhere in the thread! You've acknowledged my exact case already. Cheaters will identify as poly and use it as an excuse.

Someone who plays mono and cheats is just a scumfuck cheater who broke my trust, but painting it as poly nature jumps straight into manipulative garbage territory and does indeed poison my notion of all poly people, because while they're still a scumfuck cheater it's not for me to deny them being poly as well; they can still be both and in my case of a cheater claiming poly I do genuinely believe she was poly, it just made a really shit excuse.

But you have the gall to call me a hypocrite while playing this two-faced doublespeak game where the cheaters who masquerade as poly don't actually exist or matter or something, or even worse you're suggesting that poly people don't or can't cheat, which again is fuckery of definitions.

You forget the entire context anyway. if someone gets as far as a first date and *then* brings up poly relationships, that's the big red flag. The mere possibility that they're using it as a cloak to cheat, on me or with me, is unacceptable.

It's very simple: My trust is simply harder to earn for a poly person, and it starts with them being up-front about their definition of poly. If they are vaguely 'poly', hard pass. If they are concise, direct, and 'poly/closed', I'll continue a conversation with them.

I might even be one, they aren't the problem. The problem is the excuse of ""I told you I was poly, that means an open relationship"" after someone cheats, usually long after the line in my prior post.

Those very few people ruin it for the rest. ""Leaning open"" is also to mean that they are seeking other relationships on their own while in one, independently dating but not sleeping with new people.

You can #NotAllPoly all you like, it's still gonna be a hard no from me. I recently had someone blow up at me on a dating app, turning into a demeaning judgemental shitfuck overnight, because I merely suggested that I'm hesitant with poly folk after getting burned once. That *also* doesn't help.

If you go to the Universal Renderer, you can also do secondary textures on the 2D sprite assets, but they didn't quite load into the shader pipeline quite correctly last I checked. They're suppose to just auto-populate as variables in your fragment shader. Once this is working, it will be possible to have correct normal maps on skeletal animated 2D, so your shadows are from real lighting and are correct not matter what rotation."
