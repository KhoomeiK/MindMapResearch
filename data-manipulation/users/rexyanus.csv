Bonsai,ff2vttw,t1_ff0s808,1579526095.0,Yeah I mist her regularly too to keep her needles from getting dusty. What does dormancy in a juniper look like? Since I've been setting her out she's been bringing on her needles a bit. I also stopped fertilizing her in the hopes that would help.

Bonsai,feypzp6,t3_eqe2xs,1579449074.0,"_Indoor Juniper (1.5â€“2years)_

I have had a juniper I bought from a street fair and when I bought her the man told me to soak her whenever the soil was dry, keep her in a window, and she'd be a ok.

I know what all of you are immediately thinking. No she's not going to die, she's been in this apartment for almost 2 years now, she saw a lot of new growth this past spring and summer, and she's doing great. I have a hypothesis as to why, I'd love y'all's opinions and then I need some advice.

I live in Brooklyn, NY in a 100 year old building that was designed when Spanish influenza was rampant. So our apt is incredibly well insulated and depends on through window breezes for cooling for every season except peak summer. So the juniper has been in the sunniest window for her whole time here. When I say we regulate our apt with the windows this includes the winter, currently it's 20 degrees out and her window is open a good portion of the time (our building has steam risers and radiators that all run on one thermostat so it gets hot.) I also tend to out her out when it's nice, or when it's raining or snowing for natural watering. 

The main question I have is I have been trying to force her into hibernation and her needles have started browning a bit, which let's me know it's starting to have an impact, but the rest of her is very lush and dark and I was hoping to see her needles fade a bit over winter as I've read this is a sign of successful hibernating. Should I keep sticking her outside or leave her be?

It also feels like it might be time for a repot, she's developing pretty slowly indoors and everything I've been reading suggests to check every two years. Based on the size of the pot she has now, I was hoping to get a reco on a new pot size should she need it.
