Because they were already at the bottom of the ""ravine"" (far from the right word, BTW) and the injuries aren't consistent with falling a few yards/metres on snow anyway. For the gravity and for the unusual way force was applied.

> This is what I was remembering. But the two bodies at the bottom of the tree did not have injuries. It is still possible that one or more of the injured parties were injuring in climbing the tree, but their injuries did not prevent them from moving, alone or with help from the others, down into the ravine.

Surely the four who died in the ravine were at the tree before, because they put on clothes belonging to those who died of - let say -exposure at the tree and the clothes were singed by fire. They were already better dressed than anyone else, with tent shoes at their feet (light, warm felt shoes not fit to walk on snow. Anyone else had mismatched socks).

Two of the four (Ludmilla Dubinina and Semyon Zolotarev) died of having a series of ribs broken on the same side of the chest. Twice. Basically they couldn't breath because when the diaphragm moved the chest caved in instead of expanding. Nicolai Thibeaux's skull was hit by a roundish object and caved in, breaking from there to the forehead. Those injuries aren't consistent with moving, cutting branches, disrobing corpses, building caves in the snow or simply with living for more than a few minutes.
