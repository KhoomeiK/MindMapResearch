Steak by steak, of course!

This is the best metaphor for managing objetives. 

1) Start with an objetive that ignites your heart. Try something that brings you joy, happiness, excitement. We are fueled by emotions so focus in them before defining a rational objetive. If you already have some objetives, try to forge them until they cheer you up. ""Stop spending time in front of computer"" is not that exciting as ""Trying some boardgames in my local library so I can meet interesting people"". The WHY is important.

2) Be reasonable, i. e., pick achievable objetives. The steak must be within the dimensions you can eat. ""Run 10 km a day"" is hard. ""Start with jogging for 5 blocks"" maybe not.

3) Always check your results. You didn't manage to eat the whole steak? Break it in 2 or so, but keep track of your accomplishments. Celebrate with them. Keep the pace to stablish good behaviors. You aren't a refrigerator that was born ready. You are making yourself everyday so cheer up and give yourself some love and space to grow safely."
socialskills,fe5ehx5,t3_entk8t,1578868407.0,"It's all about about strokes. Not the bad ones.

We often need endorphines. We get it from exercises and people by social rewards among other things. A guy I met called that social rewards ""strokes"". A stroke is anything that shows you that you exists: a slap, an excuse, a glance, a handshake etc. We crave for strokes in a way that we can even fight or argue with someone just to have some social interaction. This usually happens when we find ourselves hurting people or being rude without reasonable motivations. It is our mind asking for strokes in a bad way.

The best strokes come from people intimate to us: kissing, sex, hugging, a shoulder to cry on, but we also get strokes from more formal activities like working on a project or even playing games together. 

There is something like an ""order"" of intimacy that you can build from the lowest to the highest value of strokes in order to clarify how to ask for strokes in a healthy way:

1) rituals. Movements known by people that are used to see if someone isn't too weird or threatning.""How are you/fine and you/fine too"" is a good example. Remember dialogs that sounds artificial but everone does. Those are ""tests"" our minds do to see if someone can be trusted or at least won't kill us.

2) activities. Things that 2 or more people do without entering in the intimacy field. Our jobs work like that. If you and I work together we experience doing stuff and by that we can check if we have anything in common. We sum our skills to achieve something. 

3) pastime. For instance, it happens when you and I start sharing our illness as if were acknowledging we are the same. Can be doing by talking about hobbies, our moms, our sons... There is no obrigations. We are saying ""we have things in common"".

4) games. Not the good ones. We play psychological games when we engage in dialogs that repeat over and over. Games are kind of disonest. They try to prove something and we play that because we don't know how to ask for good strokes so we try to take it by pshycological force. Those who play psychological games usually feel that had been there before. For instance, think about an arguing that we ALWAYS have with our partner about anything. Think about that AHEM! reapeated over and over, louder and louder untill an arguing starts. Thats a game. They start with a bait. Once someone picks it, the game continues until the tedious and predictable conclusion is reached. Remember that games like these are inconscious. Bringing the games to awareness help us to manage our crave for strokes.

5) intimacy. Time spent together when there is no judgement. We got intimacy when we can be ourselves without fear of being criticized or hurt.

The reason of life is reaching intimacy, but think about the value of the stroke. We can be intimate with a few people and never talk to anyone besides that or work work work and never be intimate or even talk a lot about the weather or the news with anyone we know to receive more by raising the number of strokes instead of having a few but intense ones.

If you got it right, this is how we make friends. 

""But man... How do we know if it's time to try something more intimate with someone?""

We don't. 

BUT... We can feel. It's like a curse jar. We put a virtual dolar in our relationships when we positive stroke them. In time, when we feel that the jar are more full than empty, we can try more like asking out or invite to a diner... And so on.
