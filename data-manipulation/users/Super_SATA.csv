AskReddit,ffrkc9p,t1_ffrbnkf,1580159797.0,"Very good alternate read of this situation that I did not consider. What you are describing is ""mindfulness,"" and it is a very important skill that we must all practice. I especially like how you said that considering the intentions of others takes the edge off of your own pain; that's a very powerful statement.

To rephrase what you said in my own terms, it is this guy's categorical imperative to put the thoughts of others first. If he had done that, he, ideally, would have redirected his feelings of hurt towards feelings of acceptance or accommodation, and then he would have made an objective decision moving forward, either to stay friends or part ways.

Not that this diminishes any of what you said, but I would also argue that it was the categorical imperative of his frat brothers to have told him in some capacity. Yes, it may have been a complete oversight or not a big deal to them, and, yes, it is selfish to expect that to a certain extent, but it still would have been a curteous thing to do, and it would have reduced the pain that they (inadvertently) caused. Either way, you are correct that we shouldn't expect these things.

The bottom line is that this situation is a learning experience, and there are a few valuable ways to read into what happened here."

AskReddit,ff9hinu,t1_ff9fwz8,1579713136.0,"Ok, that makes more sense. I don't want to tell you how to live your life, but weed can also be about your own mindset. You don't have to make associations based on the typical. Even if most people use it just to numb themselves and laze, one can still use it for more fulfilling purposes. For example, playing music while high can be a fulfilling experience. The primary issue is that the brain becomes tolerant to it very quickly, and the ""high"" turns into a ""buzz"" when used in excess, which is what most people fall victim to when they begin to believe that weed is *only* about being a stoner, or getting baked.

You don't have to associate with those people if they incur a negative quality onto your life. Getting high by yourself could become a meditative, explorative activity. Moreover, high-sativa strains can be much more invigorating than the depressive, relaxing indica strains.

But like I said, do what works for you. I just think there are more ways to approach weed that don't have to be so negative."

I'm 100% with you on putting this comic here. It is racist, and it is reprehensible. However, I think you are doing this sub a disservice by mischaracterizing the comic. The comic does not compare black people to shit. That is a fact. It compares their movement to shit, which is racist in itself.
