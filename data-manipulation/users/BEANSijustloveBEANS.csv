BikeCammers,fgw2gyc,t1_fgvji39,1581155893.0,"I'm not denying that drivers don't do that, what I'm saying is that we do it 10 fold as much. I see one driver a month speed through a red and I see 5+ cyclists a day do it. If we want drivers to respect us then we should respect the road rules."
BikeCammers,fgvvz9d,t1_fgvj5v0,1581153669.0,"It's rude because it makes us all look like dickheads who demand to treated equally on the road yet won't follow the rules of stoplights. 

Depends where you're from, my city is a cycling city yet I still see 5-10 people a day ignore red lights"
BikeCammers,fgufp9s,t1_fguegr0,1581119664.0,"And that totally erasers the fact that we cyclists run red lights all the time, nice argument."
BikeCammers,fguakoj,t3_evko90,1581116199.0,"Cars definitely do run reds within a few seconds but I see 5-10 cyclists a day run a red that's been red for 10-15 seconds, they wait for a gap in the traffic and breeze right on through. Ive never seen a car do that."

AustralianPolitics,fgs3wkg,t1_fgs371v,1581070285.0,"They implemented the tax on the advice of world leading experts on carbon pricing emissions, sometimes you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet.

The tax also didn't effect the general public, it targeted big business, you can thank Murdoch and Rinehart for that misinformation."
worldnews,fgrzu8y,t1_fgqokvr,1581064432.0,Better news would be the liberals are leaving government due to immense amounts of corruption coming to light.

AustralianPolitics,fgkdsvy,t1_fgkcr8k,1580863227.0,"Well let's just say that I am, you're the one that's making these unsubstantiated claims and I'm asking for information. Why would you make wild claims if you're not prepared to back them up."
AustralianPolitics,fgkb6bg,t1_fgkayax,1580861502.0,"Arh yes thats how debates and facts work.

""You want proof of my claims, piss off""

Great argument."
AustralianPolitics,fgk9mpe,t1_fgk9je7,1580860497.0,"All the points you raised. 

I never said I didn't believe you, you've made that assumption, I've asked if you can back up what you say."

Blacksmith,fghtzt2,t1_fghqgan,1580793819.0,"Sounds about right. 
I can't find one for cheaper than $1200 my way. 

Weight doesn't even play a factor to these people, 50kgs/$1200, 78kgs/$1200, 113kgs/$1200, with comments like ""this was my grandfather's, in great condition"" except the horn and heel are cracked off. Asking them drop the price is beyond pointless."
