studentloandefaulters,ffm2bgc,t3_eu6qu1,1580047374.0,So she declared bankruptcy and still had to pay $100k student loans. That's asinine. Bankruptcy means you take a massive blackmark on your credit for 7 years in exchange for the debts being eliminated. Not so you can pay back student loans at a reduced rate. Wtf
Busking,ffby3bd,t3_es9p7z,1579786454.0,Your rig and your passion is all that's needed. Look at those guys who go viral on the subway in New York. Barebones stuff.
studentloandefaulters,ff8pzr5,t3_es84d7,1579691139.0,"This is just a shill post probably by someone working for the Dept of Ed. Go post elsewhere. We're all about defaulting because the system is corrupt, not continuing to pay on hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt just to get an education. Unreal that the US even charges interest on this junk. Anyway, go post this elsewhere and go kiss some more of Devos's ass while you're at it."

Busking,ff1wd4r,t1_ff1t2w3,1579487676.0,I was just answering the guys question. I use an EX like I said. I do know someone who lugs around all that by the way + more. Rundle Mall.
Busking,ff1rg0o,t1_ff1qo3g,1579484539.0,"If we're talking quality, a 12-15 powered speaker and a passive mixer will give someone the best combo of sound quality and volume if they need it. Some people busk on very loud streets and need the volume. Others like myself use lower volumes and rely on the buildings echo to amplify it. I agree with all your points."
Busking,ff09weg,t3_eqzecr,1579466734.0,The Street Cube EX is a lot louder than the S1 Pro. An upgrade from the EX would be a PA speaker and mixer I'd imagine. I think that someone would need to buy at least 2 s1 Pros to get decent volume. I know this because my busker friends own S1 pros
Busking,fexhnby,t3_eqqk0f,1579431152.0,"Bro, I knew you could do it. Busking can be fun & lucrative. As you get better, you'll make more and more. I only did $89 last night, but that was in the face of a dying 9V (guitar had no volume) and maybe my setlist needs some tweaking again. Anyway, cool to see brother, rock on!"
Busking,feprmrb,t3_eqc12c,1579328940.0,$7 is my standard. Basically a $5 note and a $2 coin. Any silver that gets thrown in the case gets hidden because you want people thinking you're worth a lot.

studentloandefaulters,feilb2s,t3_ep6x0p,1579141188.0,It would be an absolute relief to have student loans eliminated by law under a Sanders administration.

BernieSanders,fegd0zn,t1_fegb2n1,1579088261.0,No billionaire belongs in politics. It is about power for them. Not the people.
Busking,fecpwdg,t1_fec699g,1578980352.0,"I wasn't saying it to brag, I was using it to say your tone isn't too important. What's important is your act. Is it interesting? Does it make people want to stop dead in their tracks? What's your energy like? Do you connect with people? You can literally play any song but it needs to capture them. I mainly do originals and in a mall where there are normally 3 other buskers. But yeah just focus on making your act exciting. The unfortunate thing w guitar is that there are so many guitarists in the world that its difficult getting the public to not blend you in with the others. 

Not sure if you've heard of Pipe Guy but the fact that his act is different and exciting is probably a big reason he makes a ton of money out here and went viral on YouTube. We play in the same mall."

Busking,fe8i7f8,t1_fe6bggj,1578926413.0,"I plug my guitar into the mono jack of input 3 on the Roland Street EX, meaning no EQ. The only EQ I have is on the guitar itself and that's set to flat. I roll off some of the bass sometimes but it doesn't matter much. As long as you don't have a very shrill sound or muddy sound, that's turned up way too loud, you should be alright. My average is about $200 every busking session."

Split that shit 50/50 and send a clear signal, no expectations of anything. We don't like footing your bill to begin with, we just have to act like we gladly do.  


Waiting for all the knights in shining armor to comment how none of this is true."
studentloandefaulters,fdzf2ec,t1_fdqisdq,1578789629.0,Bernie all the way. Complete elimination. I'm not voting for someone like Warren.
GetMotivated,fdtxqvb,t1_fdqg4sq,1578723958.0,Sounds like you are the one not listening to people who have experience in the industry telling you about how it works.
GetMotivated,fdp0yvs,t1_fdo0it4,1578617408.0,"What you have to realize is that record A&Rs can lose their entire careers if they take on one artist that flops. Record labels are investors essentially and you don't have to swing at every pitch. In fact, with investing, you can turn down 95% of stocks and make millions from only a select few if you know what you're doing. It's the same concept. A&Rs are trying to find absolute homeruns so they'll turn down a helluva lot of artists before they find one that suits their label and one they want to invest millions into. Doesn't mean the artist is bad or that they should change."
GetMotivated,fdp00ts,t1_fdnwzlv,1578616779.0,100% disagree with this
Busking,fdnypcq,t1_fdlnruf,1578595546.0,"Hmm, the Cube Street is quite limited, I have the EX so quite familiar. But if you decide to go beyond the basic fx, chorus would certainly do the trick. A 12-string already sounds chorus-y so I imagine verb + chorus would give you a dreamy tone."
Busking,fdnr37l,t1_fdn0vqs,1578591191.0,"Still going with that, aye?"
Busking,fdnqivh,t1_fdn0yun,1578590914.0,"That's the idea of performing. Look at me. ;) 
Maybe this forum isn't for you."
Busking,fdlnhce,t3_em0y6l,1578528024.0,No walls to bounce off of? Then plain ol’ reverb sounds like a winner to me. Especially w a 12-string. Basic but its almost a necessity.
Busking,fdkfbhh,t1_fdkd6xe,1578502661.0,"Accurate. Could you imagine people labeling mainstream performers, for example Ed Sheeran, narcissists because they have a product with their name on it, with songs they sung themselves, even starring in their own music videos? Btw, we all know Ed Sheeran was a busker too. 

I just don't understand the mentality of people who chose to throw negative energy at musicians who chose to put fear behind them and perform for the public domain. Busking saved me personally. I didn't like life all that much before but now busking gives me something to really look forward to every week and keeps me in a positive place. I'm sure I can't be the only one."
Busking,fdjtb24,t1_fdjn8en,1578486748.0,"Yes! Matter of fact, there are outstanding dancers, magicians, and even painters, to name a few!"
Busking,fdjazei,t1_fdgdn54,1578463750.0,"I didn't really have the busking community in mind when I put this together. It was more or less a collage of footage showing my personal progression over time, but eventually thought it might bring value to someone so I posted here.

There's not much preparation that goes into busking, you just learn some tunes, try 'em in public, if those don't get the reaction you seek, switch up. When you busk, there can be so few people sometimes that it basically is a practice session in itself. 

I guess I could have discussed difficulties, but I didn't want to highlight negatives. Securing a quiet spot was often a difficulty though, whether due to house music from venues or other buskers playing loudly. I'm usually cool with drunk people, I know how to handle them. It's the meth heads and hard drug addicts that will get you nervous. One night some guy went around screaming at the top of his lungs, turning over garbage cans right in front of my spot, but he was chased off by security thankfully. Must have been on meth, who knows. I actually think I have that footage... But yeah just wanted to keep it positive.

Anyway, I started off with less than an hour of music prepared and have now ended up with about 130 songs, so when I first went out I'd just repeat my first set just at different busking locations but now I'll play all sorts of different tunes until my voice just says ""enough"" lol. There's no real secret to busking other than getting over your fears, going out to play, and just improving. It is definitely a stage."
Busking,fdj9if9,t3_elj28e,1578462374.0,"The concept of busking isn't an online activity. Busking is getting out on the streets and performing for cash. You know, the activity you just labeled in a previous comment on this forum as a narcissist activity and worthy of cringe. I suggest you go start a twitch channel or YouTube channel that gets 2 watchers if you can't step outside your introverted bubble while you continue to criticize everyone else who has the nerve to chase what they love."
Busking,fdj980h,t1_fdi5f6z,1578462119.0,Oh well mate. It's how I've been surviving without a job for 10 months now so knock it all you want as a narcissist activity. You've just labeled all buskers as a bunch of narcissists. Way to go.
