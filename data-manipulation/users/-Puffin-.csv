YouShouldKnow,ffdj5dd,t1_ffd55x0,1579821974.0,AFAIK it’s due to its ph balance and it’s high sugar content. Bacteria that spoil food can’t live In honey.
YouShouldKnow,ffcwg90,t1_ffcw6wp,1579808697.0,"So now that I went to find out, “dating” our product is a requirement. This is in order to allow us to do emergency recalls, especially if we have multiple brands packaged on the same date it’s traceable."
YouShouldKnow,ffcw19j,t1_ffcvted,1579808444.0,"Now that you mention it, we have both a packaged date and a best before. It may be the package date being present that is the legal requirement."
YouShouldKnow,ffcvp6r,t1_ffcvlji,1579808241.0,"I can believe that. I am not in the United States however. Though you are correct, it’s a “best before” date."
YouShouldKnow,ffcit37,t1_ffcfwth,1579800371.0,We make a whipped cream honey that is absolutely delicious.
YouShouldKnow,ffbvgrn,t3_espzjo,1579784118.0,"Expiration date for honey is there because it’s required by law. Ours is when it will crystallize in the container without opening(2 years).

I work in a honey bottling plant and am a back up honey processor.

Edit:changed solidify to crystallize as it’s probably the better term.

Edit2.0: technically it’s not an expiration date as mentioned by a comment, it’s a “best before” date.

Edit3.0: I am not American, so obviously my country’s regulations are different. Also, as I just educated myself further in our processes, our honey doesn’t require a best before/expiration date, just needs to be dated. This is in order to create traceability for emergency recalls."
leagueoflegends,ff6kcrx,t1_ff6ehcj,1579629051.0,"As a counter point- skt has never done as well as they had previously when Ccarter was in charge. Now you could say that was due to kkoma no longer being their strategic coach, however he was still involved with the team going forward."
leagueoflegends,ff5u6s8,t3_errtrh,1579610379.0,"Release champions are the fault of the champion design team, not the balance team. Balance team just deals with the problem after the fact.

leagueoflegends,ff5trr4,t3_ers2u6,1579609941.0,"Actually it was Camilles release that killed rumble top. She counters him so hard. 

Mid rumble can always get wave priority, roams well, 2v2s well and just does a butt load of damage. On top of that he has almost no bad match ups vs mid laners."
leagueoflegends,ff5tk0w,t3_ersmk5,1579609712.0,This is an awful idea. Imagine going against a high elo smurf and for the next few games you get less LP because you didn’t get to farm vs a diamond + player.
leagueoflegends,ff5t3b0,t3_erttle,1579609211.0,"The point for those tips is that you don’t know your team. You can’t rely on them because you don’t know what they are capable. However if you trust yourself, then giving yourself the best chance to carry is a good strategy. 

That being said, if I see someone hard popping off and looking clean while doing it, I will do whatever it takes to get that guy to carry, as I can tell he has the skills to do so."

leagueoflegends,ff4m298,t1_ff4lz7t,1579566894.0,"Fucking strawman I swear. 

All I said was his passive has sustain."
leagueoflegends,ff4k6nf,t1_ff4jq92,1579565590.0,"that's not true. you can build skills to work better with people, even if they change over time. will it work as well if you had the same people over and over again? no. however that doesn't mean there aren't skills you can work on that help you work with others, patience specifically."
leagueoflegends,ff4k14r,t1_ff4jqcc,1579565483.0,"i was given those examples, and thus responded to them. read the whole chain next time. i literally used the exact example given to me.

also i have mastery 6 on sett, so yea know.

i also would say its better that you must hit an ability then to hit nothing and get a large shield for free. now i don't play in iron where abilities are easy to hit because people don't understand positioning, so i don't see your point of view, sorry."
leagueoflegends,ff4j0r3,t1_ff4iu5r,1579564779.0,"I do. I also know that those heals require good positioning and ability usage while sett needs neither of those. 

I also know sett gets free healing on his passive. So he gets best of both worlds."
leagueoflegends,ff4iots,t3_erk5qh,1579564551.0,"Wait, are saying that in a team game learning to play as a team has intrinsic value? Wow! Incredible. 

Now here’s another awesome life secret: water is wet."
leagueoflegends,ff4ge64,t3_erkpxr,1579562973.0,"He’s fine as is, just remove 15% of his shield and he’s perfectly balanced."
leagueoflegends,ff4f6w8,t1_ff4cgku,1579562158.0,"So Darius and illaoi must hit you with their abilities to gain large amounts of health, and multiple enemies to make it truly significant. Nasus ability is an ultimate and thus is a terrible comparison to a normal ability, never mind the CD difference. Sett gets a massive shield on a 8 second cool down while having 0 requirements beyond taking some damage. Also it does true damage just because. 

Also setts passive is sustain/survivability too."
leagueoflegends,ff4elvf,t1_ff4d1r6,1579561770.0,That’s in under 1 week. Aphelios hovered around 47% w/r week 1. Now I don’t know anyone who would say aphelios was under tuned.
leagueoflegends,ff4efwc,t1_ff4d9be,1579561659.0,"Gangplank is not countered by hard cc. Neither are tanks, or most bruisers. Assassins on the other hand are squishy enough to be “one shot” when under hard cc"
leagueoflegends,ff4aasg,t3_erhyh1,1579558975.0,It’s almost like then no one Qs for jungle and we all wait 10-15 minutes for Q pops.
leagueoflegends,ff4a3sz,t3_erj24f,1579558852.0,"You respect her Q range, and if she hits you, respect her next AA. Play champs with AOE in their kit. Rumble mid is a great counter."
leagueoflegends,ff49yxn,t1_ff46gig,1579558767.0,Which she already has. 46.5% win rate. She is weak enough and the nerfs would have been great before they gutted her else where.
leagueoflegends,ff49g4f,t3_erk2c9,1579558440.0,All those champs are countered by hard cc.
leagueoflegends,ff47kdc,t3_erjd45,1579557267.0,"Ask farming for 15 mins is a cancer strategy and shouldn’t be strong. It’s the refusing to play the game  strategy and it’s cancer to be stuck with that player. 

Jungle sucks now, but I’m glad that strategy isn’t being supported by rito."

leagueoflegends,fdynjb6,t3_enab1q,1578781729.0,Pretty basic. Most prefer the EQWQ because the first Q is guaranteed.
leagueoflegends,fdymu1r,t3_enbs9w,1578781466.0,"So In your opinion, a champ like malz or skarner should be countered by a summoner spell? That’s ok to you?"

leagueoflegends,fdydhnp,t1_fdyctvq,1578778606.0,"The game was flawed because it wasn’t worried about balance. When champs like arbatur and double headed giant exist, they aren’t trying to create a balanced competitive game. That’s fine, but mobas are by design competitive. All other mobas that have tried to be less competitive fail, and quickly. 

If a blizzard game fails, especially one that has all the popular characters in it and is in a genre that has been already proven to work, you know they fucked up in design and balance."
leagueoflegends,fdyar8q,t1_fdya6li,1578777796.0,"Your right, we should look at a failed game in the same genre to make our game better. It’s almost like a game that failed miserably as a competitive game shouldn’t be the example we want to follow.

leagueoflegends,fdqrwgs,t1_fdqqqur,1578673565.0,"Again, mid lane is about reacting first to a play, or even better, being proactive first on the map. In order to do that with minimal losses you need to get priority through pushing the wave in, and getting back when it bounces back to your side. So unless wave clear gets significantly changed, he won’t be able to keep up. 

Even if meta shifts, gaining priority and effecting other lanes probably won’t unless a greater strategy is implemented. That being said, push and roam has been a major part of mid for several seasons, and through many different meta shifts"
leagueoflegends,fdqpz6r,t1_fdqppnb,1578672380.0,"Pyke exists without cs, it’s what makes him a very special case and why riot nerfed the shit out of lane Pyke, and will continue to do so. Sylas doesn’t have an ability that gives him 300 gold for both him and whoever assisted.

leagueoflegends,fdqjtsv,t1_fdqbztf,1578668411.0,He has 0 wave clear now. Wave clear to gain priority is important in pro play. that he will lose because he will always get to any fight/objectives late is a good reason he won’t be played.

leagueoflegends,fdq9n62,t1_fdpuxt7,1578660362.0,Really? Cause I’m top lane there are 2 tanks in top 5 win rates and 4 in top 10. That’s pretty good.

leagueoflegends,fdnnqo9,t3_emawxy,1578589593.0,You just need to roam more. You being 3 levels ahead of everyone doesn’t matter if you never put it to use. Top lane has less effect but the champions can be strong
