I am terrible at consistency at the 95-100% level with my pets as I'm like a typical try my best bit inconsistent mom. I'll try video taping and following your recommendations but it may be a minute. Just started a new director position at work and I'm either working or relaxing at home. Plus, birds have strong personalities and if you're not absolutely consistent, you have to watch for them to be in the mood. He's too well fed for typical lab experiments with food rewards. He simply has to be attentive and in a focused mood. Plus I have to have my phone and he reacts to me videoing him. I'll give it a go soon. It will probably require more than a few attempts. He is used to me petting him so it will be more about getting him used to the phone being pointed at him. He notices and it becomes his focus."
Birbs,ffarx9e,t1_ffa5m50,1579743072.0,"I'm not 100% but my umbrella cockatoo has started (last 5 years or so) to act like he understands the cockatoo in the mirror is him.  In the beginning,  he absolutely didn't but over the years,  he sees himself on my shoulder or arm and it seems like he is starting to get it.  Honestly,  I don't put him in front of a mirror very often,  but I've had him since 2003. They're pretty smart,  so he may have figured it out. You can see him look at me in the mirror,  then in person then the cockatoo in the mirror and then he lifts a claw and looks back and forth and moves it while checking.  Who knows for sure,  but he doesn't get excited like he does when he sees another bird."
funny,fetk2c1,t3_eqg792,1579376211.0,If love dark indigo solid with little bitty pinpoint stars on the collar.  But that's a personal preference. Not sure what their branches purpose is though.

Birbs,femmkvq,t3_epiose,1579262702.0,"I have an umbrella cockatoo that will squeeze himself into the popcorn bag if you don't stop him. He doesn't even like the popcorn, just the bag."
Birbs,femmi5b,t1_felzkw7,1579262612.0,My cockatoo wouldn't poop in his mini cave. He likes the freedom to aim away from things. :)
aww,fdsm6id,t1_fds4b1h,1578705008.0,"I got a kitten when my girl was a little over a year.  I was told it was best to get the second before the first was too much over a year and I wanted 2.  She still threw a lot of hissy fits and looked like she was going to kill him (swatting, hissing, growling, spitting).  They kept me up all weekend and I kept them separate at night while she screamed all night through the door at him.  On Monday,  my sleep deprived self decided they needed to sort it out and I left them in the house together while I went to work.  I wasn't sure if I'd come home to a bloodbath.  They were in this position asleep when I got home and were friends from then on.  I just needed to get out of the way.  Good thing they became friends.  He turned out to be a very loving,  mostly Maine Coone big boy (21 lbs to her 14 lbs, she was a decent size tuxedo cat)."
aww,fd5qmaq,t1_fd4z4jq,1578180383.0,Looked the same to me.  No weight being put on those back feet.
WTF,f9ly4vg,t3_e5s85a,1575435210.0,Lykoi or werewolf cat?
