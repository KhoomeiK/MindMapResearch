However, your whole view about art and its subjective approach is really childish and narrow, given the fact that you really think graffiti is a ""tiny"" subgenre of art like it didn't influence other genres **big time** says a lot about how little you know about art.

Calling everyone that disagrees with you a ""kid"", ""laughable"" or ""loser"" just strengthens the believe that you are indeed some old hwite suburban hag or bastard that can't comprehend and tolerate things that happen outside of his/her control.
