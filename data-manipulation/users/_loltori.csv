AmItheAsshole,ffunqef,t3_ev6tf4,1580245815.0,"NTA., and honestly you deserve an award for that one. The planet is literally dying, litterbugs got what they deserved."
TrueOffMyChest,fffoila,t3_et5f4s,1579888373.0,"i used to identify as “demisexual” until i learned to stop confusing preferences with sexualities. the newer generation just keeps on coming up with new words for every single little preference they might have in order to feel special. it’s like, “no, exclusively liking people with brown hair is not a sexuality. it’s a preference. please stop”."

LetsNotMeet,ff41os2,t1_ff41j68,1579553614.0,omg my own little sister suffocated a kitten “because it was dying and she wanted to put it out of its misery”. freaking psychos!
LetsNotMeet,ff3rw7a,t3_erdgtf,1579547521.0,"a girl i went to middle school with (i hated her, she was a bully and awful to everyone) was very recently charged for brutally murdering her child. apparently she had some beef with her baby daddy so she took it out on the kid. if i remember right, she threw the baby against a wall. it’s insane to just sit there and think that you never know what anyone around you is capable of"
AmItheAsshole,feo30bj,t3_eq24av,1579294458.0,"NTA. your sister is trying to cover up her own insecurities by making fun of others in order to make her feel better about herself. she needed to be called out for her childish behavior. i might not have outed her in front of her boyfriend like that, but it needed to be done."
LetsNotMeet,fej61ok,t3_ep1ikf,1579158346.0,"after i read this, i had to get up and do a quick walk around my house to make sure all of my doors and windows were locked. they are always shut and locked because i’m extremely paranoid as is, but this terrified me."

Makeup101,fdkyp4b,t3_elk3ru,1578513892.0,"this one is better, i love the glitter!"
AmItheAsshole,fdhg7hp,t3_elc7z5,1578421971.0,"NTA. Your little brother is an innocent and helpless child. He comes before your girlfriend, who could support herself financially and find her own place if she weren’t so careless with her money. From the sounds of it, you gave her many opportunities to be welcoming to your little brother and she ignored every request. Calling a ten year old child worthless would be grounds for a break up imo, but kicking her out was sufficient."
AmItheAsshole,fdg56az,t3_el1ndt,1578380448.0,NTA. why would you pay for food you didn’t eat?
Makeup101,fdg51ca,t3_el1rza,1578380292.0,this is gorgeous!
AskWomen,fdeff1u,t3_ekvi2h,1578337845.0,"i like my name enough, but i get really tired of people making jokes about lingerie and asking me what my secret is. especially older men or family members. it’s fucking disgusting, so i usually just go by my nickname. but other than lewd jokes, it doesn’t impact my life very much. 
if i could change it i would probably change it to Anastasia for no other reason than i just think it’s a pretty name."
