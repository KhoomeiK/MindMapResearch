Months before I remarried, I made the mistake of getting off it quickly and it was like I was trapped in a fun house.  I didn't know I was supposed to slowly wean off from it.  Every time I turned my head there were slow motion jerky pictures of each part of the turn of my head.  Made driving very iffy and I couldn't think straight.  It took months for those issues to wear off and I lost my job because I couldn't think straight. Never again will I take that crap."

AskReddit,ffji3zz,t3_ett7fr,1579998707.0,"Marrying my second husband was the worst and biggest fuck-up I did in my life.  He was born in wealth.  He did not know how to keep to a budget after he led a life of an artist for at least twenty years in near poverty and once we married he drained me dry of all my savings and my dignity at 50 years old. Then, when there was no more money or baby sitting to give, his daughter (whom I loved and raised like my own) started to hate me in her teenager angst years. He then chucked me away after nine years of marriage by acting crazy and wanting to buy a gun to ""protect himself from the evil witch"" meaning me. I left after the gun incident and he promised his psychiatrist to get on and stay on his meds because, well he was crazy.  However, his rich daddy flew down, closed our joint bank accounts without warning and left me with no money to buy a car, get food until my next pay check, or pay any bills that were due. I lost the house to him in the divorce that I mostly paid for when I sold some commercial property. But contrary to my mother's dire predictions, I am doing great now and have a wonderful husband (third time was the charm!) We've been married for 16 years and are happy as heck.  I may have lost everything once but I gained so much more because of it. Moral:  don't give up and don't give in to despair because there is another corner and another chapter and they can be great to experience."

The Republicans I've talked to want the witnesses that the House Republicans said they wanted to call like Biden and his son and others that don't have first hand knowledge of Trump's call and subsequent withholding of funds.  The Democrats that I've talked to want Bolton, Pompeo, Mulvaney and Pence to testify since they seem to have first hand knowledge of the call and/or withholding funds to Ukraine."

When I got home one day I had Child Protective Services at my door. She asked me about my children and I told her I didn't have any. She said the neighbors were complaining that I left my children at home while I worked.  I laughed and invited her inside to meet Sunny and boy did he put on a show for her. He laughed, cried, sang and talked to her and made her day.  She left with the giggles and a happy story to tell."

Trump is wagging the dog in front of your face and letting his buds buy oil and military stocks before we go to war so they can get even more filthy rich.  Wake up, man! By the way, I'm a little o'l retired lady living in Florida who made my money the capitalist way and still I'm pissed that a grifter like Trump is pulling the wool over the eyes of you youngsters."

That means a secondary tank and a pumping system.  Old homes can be serious money pits. Ours sure has been.

I am a long time pet sitter and you've just described a horrific ""what if"" that every pet sitter who walks a pet or house sits fears.  You treated your aunt's and uncle's pets as they did for years and then the odds changed, unfortunately under your watch. You just need to put it behind you and the next time you ever watch a pet or have a pet just make sure they are never let out of a safe enclosure or on a leash when outside.  Life is a series of lessons and some are hard to take but learn from them and then move on. I am so sorry for your family's loss."

Once it is nicely seasoned through many things cooked in it you can just wipe it out with a paper towel but for now just rinse with water and lightly buff egg particles out with a non scratch plastic thingy then heat it up again (not super hot), rub oil into it and take it off the heat.  Cool it down enough to safely store it. Cast iron is a bitch until it gets good and broken in.  Some of my pans are over 80 years old and cook like a dream."
