If there is something you can do about it then why worry.

OurPresident,fepb6oc,t3_eq1s2b,1579316272.0,Tried to explain to a guy I met from Canada why me and my partner can't have a kid although we want to. He didn't understand that our insurance is such that we would be in thousands of dollars of debt. And then it would go up hundreds a month to include the kid. He couldn't wrap his head around it.

InteriorDesign,feddkle,t3_eo5xo7,1579008516.0,How do stay warm up there? Is there still some insulation even with the exposed beams? Also what's the ceiling height at center. Thanks!
pittsburgh,fdtq0vd,t3_elfrka,1578720427.0,Sometimes Pittsburgh feels like a bigger city than it really is.
youtubehaiku,fdp1y74,t1_fdoaf9h,1578618066.0,Nah most people live in much smaller homes.
pittsburgh,fdodg5p,t1_fdls5zy,1578603121.0,"Exactly, we bought an older home last year and have been slowly fixing it up while living in it. I wish someone would give me a tax break to fix this thing up! Instead they go to giant companies making cookie cutter luxury condos because the county thinks it'll bring in business."
pittsburgh,fdod250,t1_fdl1q7c,1578602938.0,Don't you think large corps. Would just be able to build unsafe housing and would charge the same? We need to make sure changes help homesteads (people who own and live in one home) and not giant companies and investors.

skateboarding,fcyv9mq,t1_fcys1y4,1578087832.0,"I'll have to find the article or video I'm referencing. If you think skating is still as big or bigger than it had been you may be too close to the community but it's popularity has definitely faded into this millennium. 

Regarding the geometry of the above clip imagine you're just getting started and this is the only available park. You would eat it many times and think you just suck and quit when really this is just a tricky angle to drop in on it ride."

skateboarding,fcy1ke2,t1_fcxpzwn,1578073438.0,"I remember hearing about how skating was ramping up through the 80s and 90s but then a large number of parks were built without consulting skate park designers, this had terrible lines, impossible pipes (as seen in this clip) and the frustrating designs made young skaters give up and lead to a bust in the early 2000s that the community still hasn't recovered from."

EnoughMuskSpam,fcqydns,t3_eig4f4,1577894069.0,"People who sit there and break it down based on mining vs oil extraction, production, lifespan of car, then go okay based on this EV are 40% less bad for the environment. 

Then I just think 1 car to move one person... Vs one train to move hundreds at once and thousands a day... 

Cars will never be the way forward!"
