If I have outgoing mail (which I rarely do, these days) I walk all the way to then end of the driveway, put it in the box and put the flag up.  They can tell the difference between mail going *to me* from mail coming *from me* by the placement of the address on the envelope.  The postal worker only comes once a day.  They're not going to see the mail they dropped off yesterday still in my mailbox, especially if the flag is up, because I, or someone else in my family, will have taken all the mail out of the box.

The flag lets the postal worker know that there is outgoing mail to pick up, so he will stop, even if he has no mail to deliver to me.  People will only put outgoing mail into an empty mailbox.

It is rare that he *wouldn't* stop, though.  I get something in my mailbox every day except for Sundays and Federal Holidays.  Almost everything I get in my mailbox is junk that goes right into the recycling unread.  While you can opt out of some forms of junk mail, you *can't* opt out of all of it.  

There are postboxes around, but they are few and far between.  If I have something to post that is too big to fit into a standard size envelope I have to bring it to the post office to have *them* determine the postage due based on weight and size.

The U.S. has Social Security.  A portion of your paycheck goes to Social Security.  When you retire you get Social Security payments out, based on the amount you payed in.

But there are two problems with that.

1. What you are paying in while working isn't ""banked"" just for you, rather it is immediately distributed to those who are currently *receiving* Social Security.  This means that Boomers, who are about to retire, who worked jobs that payed well, are expected to draw Social Security in amounts that far exceeds what Millennials are contributing.

2.  It isn't enough no matter what you did for work.  The amount you get, even though it exceeds what you originally payed in, is a lot less than what you were earning while working.  If you are used to having a $50,000 per year income, upon retirement, you'll be getting less than $14,000 per year.  Social Security is meant to be a *supplement* to *other* forms of retirement savings.  But most people don't save enough.  Some people *can't* save enough.

Millennials have yet another problem facing them in the future.  They are avoiding having kids.  Mostly because they can't afford to.  Since that generation will be smaller, and Millennials are also working jobs that pay much less than their Boomer parents, they'll have contributed less to Social Security, making their payout smaller, and it will be put on the shoulders of a generation that is likely to be the smallest generation in ages.

There are fears, too that eventually Social Security will become too insolvent to provide help to *anyone* at some future date, though the evidence supporting such is controversial."

AskReddit,femqknn,t3_eptxb3,1579266704.0,"My father passed away in 2005.  I was then 36.  I discovered that he had a secret second family with three kids (one boy and two girls, just like mine) who's ages were very close to ours.  My half brother was 38, and my half sisters were 35 and 29.

I grew up thinking we were poor.  We lived in a shitty apartment in a bad part of town.  We always had the cheapest foods from the grocery store, all our clothes came from donation boxes.  But it turns out that my father was spending a lot more money on the secret family than he did on mine.

Worse.  This family that didn't share *his* last name got more from his estate than I and my sisters did in his will.

I take comfort from the fact that they were the three most unattractive people I have ever had the displeasure of seeing.  And the fact that I was able to grow my small inheritance while they're, all three of them, broke.

In a completely unrelated story, and to bring some levity to this thread I'll recall something that happened this past Christmas.  I was at a gathering of extended family, most of whom I only see once a decade or so.  A group of people were confronting their (step)mom about her now deceased husband's philandering that was exposed by his recent death.  She shut them down rather quickly by saying: ""We weren't cheating on each other, we were swingers.""  I wasn't the only one there who laughed out loud."
