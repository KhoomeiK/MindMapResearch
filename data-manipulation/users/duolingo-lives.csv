teenagers,fdwk04k,t3_en56ct,1578759518.0,"Yea I want to try for the coast guard scholarship, and they only accept about 500 people every year so it’s very hard to get In. My brother said to me “well if they only accept that many people they wouldn’t accept a girl”. I had to explain to my brother how the coast guard is the most diverse military branch in terms of gender and how they were the only branch to allow women in with being forced to by congress. I love the coast guard and I love the other branches to. But sadly the other branches are very sexist and that sucks. I hope basic training goes well and you can show all those people who doubted you that you can do it."

AmItheAsshole,fde3aa2,t1_fde14m2,1578330220.0,"I have tried to help her and when I confront her she just calls me a bitch. And I was mad about the weed mainly because it was her first time trying it and she had way too much. I was worried my parents would find out and she would get in trouble. I spend two hours making her tea, coffee, getting her water, and making sure she didn’t do something stupid. I also had to air out the room and get her to change clothes and shower and finally go to bed. In the morning when I asked her about it she just laughed. She doesn’t care about how I feel she even said “you’re welcome for the show”. I didn’t ask for the damn show. I wanted to get in my bed and go to sleep. Instead I had to babysit her and she decided to sleep in my bed and drool all over my pillow. If she wants to get drunk and high fine whatever. But when her decisions affect me and she doesn’t give a shit about how I feel it makes me so mad. She  doesn’t understand that I have feelings. And my feelings matter. If she just said I’m sorry I probably wouldn’t be that mad but she laughed at me and wanted ME to thank her."
AmItheAsshole,fde2g7t,t1_fde0xt3,1578329677.0,"If I tell my parents about what she’s doing I’ll lose all the trust I have with her. I want to tell them so she has to deal with the consequences but knowing my sister if I did tell them she’d probably do something like steal or tear up my money, or ruin something of mine. I learned about the shoplifted pants yesterday and this morning I was pissed so when I turned on the lights to my room she got mad at me because I didn’t warn her that I turned them on and she called me a jerk. I was mad, she’s in my room (because my oldest sister is in town and in her room) and she thinks I have to warn her before I turn on the lights? In response to her comment I said “it’s my room I don’t have to warn you about turning on the lights” and she proceeded to call me an asshole. She calls me all sorts of things “bitch” “asshole” “jerk” “what the hell is wrong with you” “what the fuck is wrong with you”. And she doesn’t care about how that makes me feel. Yesterday night she said how she thinks she’s depressed. I was annoyed at this, she has never shown any signs of depression. She doesn’t lack motivation or energy to do simple tasks, she only gets sad when my parents say she can’t do something and when she is sad is over the dumbest things. There’s a very very low chance she has depression. And if she does I can’t even feel bad for her because she makes me feel like shit when I already feel awful. I know if I tell my parents she’ll do something. My parents made her turn down a role in a play because her character would have to make out with someone who is like 8 years older then her and they didn’t like that. So in response to that she did all she could to make their life miserable. She said “I want them to feel like shit”. My poor dad was really sad because he didn’t have time to look over the script so when she was casted and he finally saw the script he felt bad telling her she couldn’t be in the play. He looked incredible sad when he told her that he was sorry and it was his fault to not looking at be script sooner. She didn’t care that he genuinely was sorry and sad she wanted to make his and my mom’s life miserable and she did so for about a month. She guilt trips people by crying all the time and then blames her actions on anything she can think of “ oh well I was being immature but now I’m not” or “or I was on my period it’s not my fault”. I’m sorry I’m ranting i just can’t talk to anyone about this and when I confront my sister she makes me feel awful and her friends back her up."

AmItheAsshole,fddwhtz,t1_fdd4tpk,1578325683.0,"ive only ever told the internet how I feel. When I’m around family I’m smiling and happy, ever since I was a kid I hid my emotions. I never let anyone see me cry and I never tell anyone how I feel. It’s not just me who’s mad. Both my parents are tired of having to make multiple trips there and back. My oldest sister got married this year and her and her husband had to go take care of my grandma because she refuses to get any help. My sister had to spend her first year of marriage helping her grandma who only complained at her. My dad who lost his father is sick and tired of having to leave home and take days off of work to go and make the trip to take care of chores. My mom is on breaking point because she’s sick and tired of my dad always leaving and she’s tired of not being able to do anything right for my grandma. When my grandma visits my family all of us are completely stressed and tired by day 2. I tried to take a shower once and my grandma starts going on about how she wants to clean the bathroom first and the toilet needs to be cleaned, I had to convince her for five minutes that the bathrooms fine and I’ll clean it after I shower. My grandma broke her arm by tripping over a box because she didn’t look where she was going, the thing is we’ve been supporting her for two years and my family can’t keep doing this. My mom and dad are so stressed out and tired of having to spend every summer helping my grandma instead of spending it with their kids. I’m not the only one who mad, I’ve e heard my mom rant about the same things on the phone and all my siblings are also tired of this. I wasn’t trying to make the comment all about me because I’m not the only one affected by this. As I said earlier my dad lost his father and he isn’t able to be sad because he has to do all this stuff. And my two oldest siblings were really close to my grandpa and they are so stressed out right now and both of them are also in college. I loved my grandpa and I do miss him. And I love my grandma so much but I just wish that my whole family didn’t have to suffer and fall apart because of her actions. It’s not just me who’s mad my whole family has fallen apart. 

My brother is depressed and stressed  and had no friends. 
My sister has started bad habits like drinking and getting high and is a jerk to my parents 
My oldest brother was diagnosed with depression and lost his scholarship due to other events that happened from mental health all triggered by the move
My oldest sister spent her first year of marriage helping my grandma but no matter what she did she couldn’t do it right. 
My mom hasn’t been able to spend one summer with all her kids and my dad keeps leaving to help my grandma 

My dad is stressed from work and constantly having to help my grandma who refuses to change anything. She spends way more then she needs on her internet provider but refuses to change. 

My family went from happy with lots of friendships to depressed with no friends"
