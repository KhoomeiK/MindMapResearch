The item was stolen by a thieves' guild, it is driving the guild crazy and slowly killing them (should be easy to adopt the recurring trope of the enemy thieves guild from about a dozen adventures if you aren't up for it yourself). The player can opt to defeat or negotiate with the thieves, but in the end will be stuck with an item that the city wants destroyed because it is too dangerous, the (surviving) thieves want destroyed because it is too dangerous, but the PC *knows* they can handle because of their father's legacy.

99.99 % they'll try to take it for themselves getting your cue, and feeling still in charge.
