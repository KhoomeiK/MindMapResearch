2 Themes: Crystals and Junk.  Temperature: Cold.  Population: Primitives.  Species: 1d6 (2).  Economic/social: Luxury/science

This planet was once highly industrialized with enormous chemical plants dedicated to producing a variety of crystals for Old Republic technology.  But the specific crystals fell out of favor, or the hyperlane route fell out of use, or for whatever reason the planet was mostly abandoned.  Now it's covered in ruined factories overgrown with crystals left to form and grow out of control after they were abandoned.  With the industry gone and no longer emitting various gasses, the climate has turned colder.  All that remains are scavengers picking through the rubble, mostly roving crawlers of Jawas and near-tribal bands of humans.

I can't really fit in the economic/social roll in directly: it rarely applies well to primitive or uninhabited worlds.  But it could be that the PCs are visiting here to dig up some long lost piece of technology, or someone has discovered that the unexpected and uncontrolled mixing of chemicals occasionally produces extraordinarily beautiful crystals which are now in high demand as jewelry."

Why focus here and not on other parts of the ground?  Answer: grass just expands into all suitable habitat.  There's no plan and no choosing ""why here over there"" since it just tries wherever a seed happens to land and grows if it prospers.  

I think a similar situation is also plausible for a galactically expanding species.  Without magic physics (and plausibly even with it) the galaxy is far too vast for a single political entity to be in charge.  A species capable of traveling through space and producing successful colonies would send out colonizers, who would build colonies, who would independently send out their own colonies, who would build more colonies, etc.  And the colonies which are best at building more colonies would come to dominate through a sort of natural selection.  

Then the perspective of a group of aliens interested in colonizing earth would not be that of a large, unified empire deciding which of a big set of planets to devote their resources to colonize, but a small colony looking for a likely nearby uninhabited star system to go head towards, given that their home system is maybe getting a bit crowded and possibly most of the other places nearby are already occupied by other groups.

Arguably even more than that.  The fourth plane was brought down by passengers and it was in the air when all this was happening.  

September 11 relied on passengers remaining passive because of how past hijacking attempts had worked.  It was never happening again regardless because passengers no longer had incentive to cooperate and stay quiet."

Like, it's ridiculous enough to be a tankie, but at least there's a nominal ideological connection there.  You are for a particular team and ignore anything bad about them.    But in this case it just seems to be ""if the US likes you, you are good.  And if you are good, the people you are against must be bad"".  So the US dislikes China and Russia so they must be great, but the Muslims China is oppressing must therefore be CIA funded terrorists but any Muslims the US is opposed to must be noble freedom fighters..."

One of the fun things about living in California is occasionally listening to liberal talk radio...I can't get it where I live because I live way up in the mountains, but last friday I was driving a few hours to pick up 70,0000 trout eggs and flipping through channels and listened to a show.  Unfortunately I can't track it down now to provide who it was, but the host was interviewing an author who had recently published a book...ah, here it is [
American Exceptionalism and American Innocence
A People's History of Fake News—From the Revolutionary War to the War on Terror](https://www.skyhorsepublishing.com/9781510742369/american-exceptionalism-and-american-innocence/).  

I had...questions.  I don't know if the history in the book is good or bad (although the host of the show totally dropped some  9/11 trutherism hints SMH) but it was just interesting to see how it was getting interpreted and applied.  It's clear the book wasn't written to be just an academic study of history, but instead to promote people to take action... but it wasn't always clear to me what they were trying to argue for or why they were arguing that way.

For example, they discussed election interference in other countries by the USA in comparison to current complaints about foreign interference in US elections.  Ok, fair comparison...but now what?  They seemed to be implying it was hypocritical to complain about this, but I guess I just don't see the proper response to electoral interference in our elections to be like ""AHA! we do it too, so.....""  I would have liked to ask them a direct question about what they thought should be done with this knowledge, to see if they had a more direct answer, but they just never got there.  

Semi-relatedly, the author was writing against American exceptionalism but seemed to be applying a special case of it.  Most notably this came up when discussing manifest destiny and other expansionist ideas.  Basically claiming these ideas were promoted by elites to benefit themselves at the expense of the lower classes (It seems to me that a lot of ordinary non-elite white people got a lot of value out of western expansionism too at the expense of the natives, and it's not quite right to say it was all driven merely by elite profit seeking, but that's another story).  Anyway the main point is that this idea of expansionism was only applied to the US, other countries were necessarily victims of it, and bad things seen about them in the media were just US propaganda...but if elites in the US are expansionist for their own benefit, then why wouldn't elites elsewhere in the world be the same way?  If it's good for other countries to resist US expansionism, why isn't the converse true?  Or maybe the idea was that the US should give China and Russia more say on the world stage just because it's more fair?  I don't know.  

And finally, the whole book is apparently about the effectiveness of using narratives about national character and values to shape public opinion, and yet the author was ripping into AOC for talking about American exceptionalism and importance of various liberal values to the country.  Basically saying that the true core of what america is about is slavery and native genocide and so it's wrong to use the language of exceptionalism and talk about liberty and freedom being important parts of American character.  But, if as your own books seems to imply, this kind of rhetoric is an effective political tool to win people to your side, is it really that bad for a politician you support to invoke it? Do you want them to win elections or not?  And if people believe myths about their country and act accordingly, do you _really_ want to promote the idea that what it means to be an American is to be racist and imperialist and _not_ to promote freedom or democracy?  Isn't it possible that would just result in further normalizing the behavior you are seeking to oppose?  I would have really honestly liked to see how the author would answer these questions but nobody was asking them.

politics,fffcilv,t1_fffamhi,1579880948.0,"If you compare man hours worked, in these big companies it's going to inevitably be totally swamped by the input of thousands of other workers no matter how much work they put in.  That said, I disagree with op's implication that this means the importance of the founder's input is proportionately swamped.  With Amazon for example, most people who work there could have never been hired and the company would have proceeded in the exact same way, but without bezos it would never have existed at all.  That doesn't mean CEO s aren't overpaid in many cases but I don't agree with people who think they are just not really important at all in places like this."
