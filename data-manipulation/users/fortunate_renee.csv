iamatotalpieceofshit,feopifm,t3_eq2dzb,1579303531.0,Went to my daughter's school to deal with bullies.  Ended up walking quietly away as the principal and school monitor verbally bullied me with a bunch of middle schoolers.  I'm 45.  My daughter was tortured in the school system for 2 years.  We tried everything.  No one would assist.  We finally had to move her 2000 miles away to live with relatives to get her out.

ptsd,feiwi1v,t3_ep7158,1579149124.0,"Get out. Now. My partner knew about my trauma. I told him specifically what was a trigger. Then he actually enacted it. Sorry to be so harsh. I know you are hurting. And for those who have been this way but changed, I'm sorry - that is an exception. It doesn't usually get better. Good luck. *Be safe.*"
PoliticalHumor,fefshun,t1_feeibsa,1579063866.0,"Agree.  Not sad he's dead. But a great metric for deciding what is right or wrong is to ask,  is it okay for *everyone* to do this thing that I'm considering? If the answer is no,  then you better think really,  really hard.  Is it okay for world leaders,  ALL world leaders,  to do what Trump did?"

AskReddit,fdm8o6n,t3_eluch8,1578542551.0,"Stung by a lionfish while swimming in the Caribbean.  Searing, unrelenting pain that lasted until morphine kicked in.  Drug myself down a deserted beach for a full mile to get to transportation. Almost lost my foot.  Paralyzed to the knee for 2 months.  Still have the nerve damage.  I've given birth,  had SARS, and recently had surgery for a pretty debilitating condition.  That fucking lionfish wins hands down"
