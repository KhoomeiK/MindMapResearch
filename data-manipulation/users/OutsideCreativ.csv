legaladvice,ffifjlc,t3_etqe27,1579972661.0,"-There are people who go to community colleges, technical colleges, 4-year state colleges, 4-year private colleges, and graduate school... and still don't get a job in their field- is your contention that they should not have to pay either?

It may be a poorly run program....  but that doesn't mean it is illegal.  Not paying due to failure to deliver would be one thing but you seem to be taking issue with the way repayment is set up to be income-based.



-A few points:  
>It wasnt until after going through a days long interview process did we find out there was pay it forward agreement. Sort of like indentured servitude where if we get a job, they take a percentage of our money, usually called an ISA.

Sometimes you go through the interview process and find out the wage is less than you desire or don't get the job at all.

>The contract is written so that basically any job you get thats anywhere near a computer qualifies, which is almost any job. You just have to make more than 60K, and they will take %12 before taxes. 

And you signed it.  Had you not gotten a job meeting these criteria, you would not be required to pay back.

>which would likely cost more than an actual computer science degree almost anywhere

But you didn't have the time or financial resources to go elsewhere.  There is always a premium for bootcamp style courses because they take less time and are more focused.

>They tricked us into signing away our paychecks then taught us how to get jobs so they can extort it back from us.

No, they fronted you the value of the program and now you have to pay back as you promised.

>pay it forward contract advertised helping future underserved minorities and poor people learn to code

They pay it forward by keeping the program going.

>They are registered as a non profit and recieve grants and donations to fund their program

I am sure it costs much more to run the program than you are estimating.

>I'm actually still teaching myself as theres just a vast amount I dont know.

Ask anyone in a tech related job ... we spend a lot of time continuously learning and self-teaching.  If this isn't something you enjoy, then tech probably isnt a great fit since it requires continuous learning and is always changing.

-60,000 x 12% = 7200 × 3 years is 21,600 not bad for landing a 60k+ job."
