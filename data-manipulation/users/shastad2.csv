few things that have helped."

AskReddit,ffen2n3,t3_et7m3w,1579855299.0,Best technique is to brush with a toothbrush with your non-dominant hand- tooth paste or no toothpaste.  That way you don't brush so hard that you wear the enamel off your teeth .  Toothpaste is just to make the brushing taste better.

AskDocs,ffe7xn0,t3_et4max,1579839130.0,"Hello- best to see a dentist.  Have you had any trauma to the jaw??  If not, without examining you , I would guess you may be grinding your teeth while sleeping and causing problems with your TMJ joint (joint between jaw and skull)
You may be helped with a night guard.

Again - can't diagnose you without seeing you but based on 25 years of practicing dentistry-
this is my best guess.  See your dentist!"

StackAdvice,fewgksu,t3_ej3boy,1579410228.0,Sorry late response.  Were these traits modeled for you as a child?  May be the reason you have difficulty accessing these emotions.  Having a baby is an extremely emotionally difficult time- maybe what you are feeling or not feeling is normal.

I have a similar background as you- have tried all the meds- they just make me numb.  Best response I have had was with Wellbutrin- felt like I was coming out of a dark cloud.  Worked for 2 years and then stopped.  Not sure which one of the above I should try first- all of them seem to get good results.  

If anyone has any thoughts or info- please post!"
