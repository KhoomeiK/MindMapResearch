AmItheAsshole,ffg6jzn,t3_etbd50,1579899538.0,"So NTA with bias.  My mom did this to me.  I won’t ever say anything is on her or use her as an excuse for my situations but she certainly didn’t help.  All I did was buy 4 muffins on sale for $4 and she flipped out.  The little bills I had were paid, she never demanded rent yet acted like because I barely worked at the time and had money, I cna spend NO.  Yeah, she sounded crazy when I showed her a car key, indicating I bought a car to give me some initiative to change my situation (I had no license util 24 since I not only failed, but couldn’t get anyone to teach me during college and home and she didn’t wanna because she was nervous of me… though taught my brother). At least getting this $400 car would help me get away from home, work more hours, and can be away from her since me being there since birth was just a bother. Her comment, “I thought you were supposed to be saving.” I just walked out the room.  Like, I am? That’s how I had money to buy it, as well as replacing parts and still some money still saved?

Just because someone is broke or not well off, doesn’t mean they have to live their life how TV shows broke people.  Homeless people can have iPhones and smart phones.  Broke people can eat a sweet item once in a blue moon.  Broke people can order stuff off Amazon and eBay (oh my mom hated my packages which costed me less than $10). Broke people deserve some indulging too.  If they weren’t, almost no one wouldn’t be doing anything and all us broke peeps would be serving rich wealthy folks hand and feet since they’re obviously reserved for it."

I don't think I had anything stolen before (luckily, we have a box that USPS puts slightly bigger boxes in, they put the key in our locked mailboxes. So it's one small nice thing in a complex) but I'm more bothered when I just don't get my item because I wasn't home and I work. So after 3 days, gets shipped back. I dunno when FedEx/UPS will come (my state tells you very accurately when the transit is coming and how long IRT, why can't they do that?) and it just seema sucky I pay for 2 day shipping and can't get it.

It doesn't stop you from feeling that deep, emotional pain. And people don't have to be homeless, or starving or whatever to be sad. I'm not homeless, I have a job (not awesome, but it pay bills) yet I'm crying a lot more than usual, and have always had issues since I was a kid. People could have gone through stuff in the past and never fully healed. Some have twisted upbringings that at the time doesn't seem like it, but you realize when you're older it was insane.

My niece doesn't have a rough home, has both parents, and they make ok money yet at 11, she's extremely emotional. She is a bit unappreciative I'll admit, but there's something with her perspective on things that has her sad. And I can relate, and rather *only* saying others havr ot worse, I do tell her about me and how she's not alone with how she feels. It's more assuring to know someone can relate than to be told others have it worse."

Think of crazy hospitals and how hectic they are, and then you can't be relieved until that person comes in. Work thinks you jave to dedicate your life to them, and then allows you free time.

But yeah, society drills it in us to work, have families, then some single job pay isn't enough, so gotta work more, spend time with families, have social fun, try to vacation but get looked at crazily when you wanna use your time, etc. I'm usually in bed by 9,and still early 30s. It's crazy."

I honestly didn't wanna move like that because if something were to happen to us, I would not be able to afford this apartment alone. It's been 5 years since we moved in together and so far we're afloat but yeah. It would be nice if people understood the reality of today is not the same 50 years ago. Also too, many people back then had good paying jobs as soon as they got outta high school or college, and many married young too. These days, we see it crazy for 20 year olds to be married already with kids. I do think though there was a lot more maturity than 20yeat olders today. 

I can also throw out there, similar to this post, that people's lives isn't meaningless or unsuccessful because they're not married and/or have kids. Some countries see unwed women in their 30s as almost being too late for them or undesirable for marriage."

Itâ€™s really cool how we share this common thing throughout time and culture because â€œmaâ€ and â€œpaâ€ or common sounds babies make."

His execution was a mess, he clearly doesn't plan ahead and everything is someone else's fault. Had he ordered ahead of time, he would be more compelled to get the Chinese and pizza.. Or be a bigger asshole by canceling the Chinese order and get pizza."
AmItheAsshole,fejxhfq,t3_epedys,1579188092.0,"You're the asshole. Had to spell that out because you really did them dirty, and with their own money and didn't even give them their change because you were too lazy to go get Chinese too? No, you weren't nervous about being late, you didn't feel like stopping at another place. Everything in your post was an excuse as to why you ended up here. YTA"
AmItheAsshole,fejv2rf,t3_ep5530,1579186523.0,"NTA. I'm from the US and we don't *have* to get lunch breaks. My job does, though unpaid and it gets taken out automatically (we don't have to clock out/in for it) so I make sure I take my lunch because we only get 30 minutes, it gets hard to implement it in my department, it gets taken out regardless, and if I can feed people and not myself then that's a problem. If you're not on company's time when eating, then she can ask aby questions or work related stuff after that lunch is over. She wouldn't be asking you of you were in your car, or off the premises so it should be treated as such."

You got her whole family to be against her keeping it and gave her an ultimatum that said, ""Either me or the baby"" and picked you because you knew that would convince her, then now all these years later you're saying it was all her choice and she didn't have to? You're disgusting."

AmItheAsshole,fegeubi,t1_fegd4iv,1579090332.0,I think it will depend on area and such because there are apartments/subsidized housing for 55+ and kids aren't allowed. So it really depends in area and the type of complex.
AmItheAsshole,fedxtz0,t3_eodunx,1579022171.0,"NTA, it's nice to take her past into consideration but it's irrelevant.  It;s expected for people to not bother people's stuff that isn't theirs.  You didn't tell them to not go in your studio?  Do you also have to tell people to not poop in the kitchen because you never specified? They're the reason why there's warning labels on everything.  But yeah, people need to learn to take responsibilities for their actions.  I think as kids, maybe instead of us being taught to say sorry, we need to be taught to fix or make amends with our actions.  ""Sorry"" doesn't fix anything, especially when you don't mean it (not saying this girl didn't)"
AmItheAsshole,fedx3iq,t3_eol4yx,1579021730.0,"NTA only IF you're honest with her.  Just be honest.  What I would do is, propose with heirloom ring and tell her, ""I know this may not be your style, but it was my great-grandmom's who was a Holocaust survivor.  You can use this as a placeholder until I can get you the ring that suits your taste.""  It gives her the chance to decide if she wants you to buy her a ring, or if she'll keep the heirloom.  I wouldn't be too heavy on her and make it seem like she's forced to wear the heirloom, but to kindheartedly give her options (and maybe save money, who knows!)"
