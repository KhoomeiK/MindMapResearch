Him: MOW


Me: ""ssssshhhhh""


Him: ^^mow



And then he loafed himself dejectedly."
AskReddit,ff3ji3w,t1_ff39h27,1579542374.0,The coffee has a super heavily roasted (almost burnt) taste *because* of the sugary drinks. They roast it super dark so you can taste it through the other stuff.

AskReddit,fckntm1,t1_fckis6c,1577729355.0,"It ended up being my answer. Screwed myself over in college. Worked myself halfway to death in the restaurant industry making pennies with ~50k in student debt looming. Going in wanting a career change and to get rid of the debt, and landed myself a solid job in network stuff and enrolled in their student loan repayment program.

Sure, there were probably some better options, but on paper this is a goddamn lifesaver."
