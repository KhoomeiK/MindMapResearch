learnprogramming,fextdvm,t1_fexqr94,1579435713.0,ARM Cortex-M which is definitely overrwhelming for a beginner like me.
learnprogramming,fewnqzd,t1_fewkxj2,1579416070.0,"yeah, thats the fall-back plan if this doesn't work.  Did you complete your math degree and pursue grad school or change majors in your undergrad?"
learnprogramming,fewno17,t1_fewm9d5,1579415978.0,"I will try this out, thank you for the advice!"
learnprogramming,fewnly9,t1_fewmd6v,1579415911.0,"> Honestly, for a first time foot in the door job, you'll probably be doing maintenance work and not new design

I'm totally fine with this.  Whatever gets my foot in the door.  I'm definitely nowhere near qualified to do ES design.  I'm looking more for a programming job than ES.  Once I get a masters, I intend to find design work.  Thank you for the suggestion!"
learnprogramming,few6or5,t1_few3fbs,1579406068.0,"Yeah, I plan to eventually do an EE masters.  I'm interested in DSP/Communication aspect of EE.  The only caveat is that won't I have issues finding a job post-graduation without work experience?  My hope is that I'm able find a job, work for 2-3 years, go to grad school, graduate, and leverage work experience to help me find the exactly type of work I want.  From the jobs qualifications I've read, they often ask for work experience in addition to grad degree (although they demand less work experience than someone with an undergrad degree)"
learnprogramming,fev7057,t1_fev2p3o,1579393849.0,"Its after lunch time and I essentially hand the hiring manager my resume.  I do my elevator pitch ""I'm interested in ES.  I noticed the job position ""A"" you guys posted on your website.  At my previous internship, I did ""X"".  Prior to that, I worked on ""X"" projects""  "".  They cut me off and start asking me rapid-fire programming questions.  I answer them correctly and then they proceed to say ""Just applying online to one of the data analyst roles or machine learning roles"".  I follow that up by saying ""How about position 'A'?""  They raise their voice and say ""you're not an electrical engineer"" and points at my courses ""see?  you only took E&M.  That's not enough!""  and I thanked them and left."
learnprogramming,fev4tmx,t1_feud1gb,1579393092.0,I agree with this.  There will holes in my reasoning due to my background.  Adopting an engineering mindset is important.
learnprogramming,fev2peo,t1_feuirjc,1579392467.0,"from the other responses, that's what I'm finding now.  But the thing is that I got my internship by applying to positions that mentioned such.  I have an upcoming job fair at school again so I probably will not approach companies that don't explicitly say math/STEM or don't specify degrees"
learnprogramming,feu56m3,t1_fetztwf,1579383227.0,"got it, thanks!  I figure knowing some basic Comp Arch is important to understand what type of bugs can come from using a scheduler."
learnprogramming,fetfknl,t1_fetfdje,1579374965.0,"yes, absolutely agree."
learnprogramming,fetep28,t1_fetdfl6,1579374658.0,"Yeah, I think this is more realistic.  Maybe start at a C developer position (if these even exist?) while I slowly build up  my portfolio with side projects."
learnprogramming,fetbc72,t1_fetahm3,1579373598.0,"thats fair to say but I've working on electronics and Arduino longer.  In other words, I didn't start building a concise understanding of what I need to learn and what type of  projects I needed to do until I made this account and reached out."
learnprogramming,feta6ue,t1_fet15yt,1579373230.0,"Noted, thank you for your feedback!"
learnprogramming,feta2xq,t1_fet530x,1579373190.0,"thank you so much, this is such a cool field and the work that embedded systems engineers do is so amazing and respectable and yeah, definitely, my biggest regret is choosing the wrong major."
learnprogramming,fet9p3k,t1_fescizc,1579373048.0,"I hear what you're saying and the whole point of me making this reddit account years ago was so I could go to certain technical subreddits, ask for advice, and just gain a bunch of knowledge from others who are in the field and have more experience than I do.   

In regards to the degree, I wish they were more explicit about that on the ad opening because again, I got my internship because I applied to positions that specified ""or related technical degree"".  If the position isn't asking for much then I'll still apply (which I see no reason not to unless I didn't meet any of the other technical criteria).  Haha, yeah, I saw that as a red flag at the career fair and took it as a cue that I need to spend my time elsewhere so did a polite ""thank your for your time"" and left.  

I don't know what you consider ""new passion"" when I've already set myself on doing this since 1.5 - 2 years ago (and I've been a computer hobbyist and enjoyed electronics my entire life).  I did those academic projects because I found them interesting and thought they'd lead me further down the path I wanted to go.  Low and behold, I land an internship doing exactly what I wanted to do (program microcontrollers ) as a result of having these projects to talk about.  I'd argue that my internship experience basically was confirmation to me that I need to go into embedded systems because I actually enjoy programming microcontrollers. 

And I'm not oblivious to why companies are seeking these particular degrees because they each have their own area of expertise (CS -> strong software design, CE -> stronger understanding of comp arch with some electronics experience, EE -> strong hardware design).  I know I'm not qualified to do design systems in ES.  Thats why I'm trying to go specifically towards software side because I'm pretty sure I read through datasheets/schematics and learn how to program microncontrollers based on my previous experience at my internship.  Its entry-level so its expected that new engineers won't provide useful work until several months into the position.  I know I definitely need a mentor and thats going to be the toughest part.

Based on my resume so far, I think know how to continue leveraging my math degree in conjunction with my current experience.  Its a daunting task so I don't know how long its going to take to get there but I just need to keep working at it."
offmychest,fet3jud,t1_ferz2if,1579371475.0,"yeah I can see why too.  Its just that, in my experience, these job positions are either not direct or honest about the type of background they prefer the most (for example, if they wanted someone with a stronger hardware background then they should say so instead of misleading people looking at the job ad with stuff thats generalized to software stuff)"
offmychest,fet2non,t1_fes8q9i,1579371279.0,thank you so much for your support and I will take you up on your offer sometime!
learnprogramming,fet2j8r,t1_fes5q65,1579371243.0,thank you
learnprogramming,fet2di3,t1_fesbbcd,1579371194.0,Thank you!  I've done a little of bare-metal on Arduino for practice and definitely think its the way to go (as opposed to always using vendor API's)
selfimprovement,fet1pv9,t1_fesmykq,1579370996.0,I will try my best trying to find one.  I graduate in May and internships typically hire students still in school so it'll be tougher.
learnprogramming,fet1hvm,t1_fesvtwr,1579370925.0,"I'm super passionate about ES because ever since I was a little kid, I liked working with electronics and computers.  Going into college, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do because I had a certain incorrect perception about electrical/computer engineering.  Fast-forward to about 1.5 years ago, I join my school's IEEE club and participate in their projects and get exposed to Arduino.  Thought it was really cool that I could program a tiny computer and got some more exposure to it (along with RaspberryPi).  Then, I got lucky with an opportunity to do an embedded software internship where I worked with actual microcontrollers and that gave me confirmation that this is actually what I want to do because it combines so many of the things I like."
learnprogramming,fereil0,t1_ferbe6r,1579352974.0,"So, obviously, I do my research on the job positions to see if there's a degree from ""X"" requirement.  If there isn't a hard requirement (i.e. it states ""or related technical degree""), then I apply if I meet some of the requirements.  I did this and did research on the companies before I approached them at a recent job fair.  I know the medical device companies, at least the ones I research, tend to have more requirements from their entry-level applicants.  But, I met some of those so I decided to give it a try and approached them.  I'm aware that I'm coming in as a weaker applicant.  Its just weird that the person that yelled me was a hiring manager (not recruiter) for the embedded department for not being an ""electrical engineer"" trying to apply to this position when the opening online said it was open to other technical degrees.    

I probably should've been more specific in my post:  I've done an embedded systems internship and I have a couple of academic projects on my resume (a traditional hardware radar system and arduino project involving moving multiple servo motors).  The projects I'm working on now are different in the sense that I'm actually programming on actual microcontrollers and these are independent, self-driven projects."
learnprogramming,ferc97r,t1_ferag3p,1579352312.0,"I'm focusing on software first.  For now, configuring peripherals on a MCU dev board and learning basic embedded stuff like blinking an LED/configuring GPIO/using one of the buses.  I have plans to set up either BLE or wireless comms between master and slave boards to transmit messages.  I don't have access to a lab bench with electronics measurement tools (oscilloscope, power supply, etc).  I have some experience going through the datasheets and looking at schematics though."
offmychest,fer89a3,t1_fenyy5l,1579351027.0,I have relevant internship experience yet companies toss my resume in the trash because of my degree.  They're so stupid.  Its like actual work experience vs. a stupid piece of paper.
careerguidance,fels711,t1_felof7h,1579229626.0,"did you do projects, take programming classes, do internships, etc?
What was your situation in terms of how you built yourself to try to sell yourself to cs positions?  And what type of position were you trying to get?  These are important factors.  Even though my degree is in Applied Math, I've done a bunch of outside stuff related to electrical engineering/cs.  Also, I know an Applied Math major who is working at a pretty well-known and big company doing front-end programming."
careerguidance,fej4wcc,t1_fegckv5,1579157021.0,"With all due respect, I've gone through my own fair share of trials and tribulations.  Of course I know its difficult because thats been my experience thus far.  At the start of my college career, I didn't know what I wanted to do and thus, I looked into career options that aligned with my current degree.  I didn't like them and I got a chance to do an internship in Embedded Systems from which I did really cool stuff that I enjoyed.  That's why I want to pursue this career path despite that its difficult and that I'm at a disadvantaged position.  Grad school will happen eventually (I've done the research, know what degree I want, and also know that getting a job will be 100x easier) but I want to try this path first (of trying to get an entry level position).  If it fails and I find nothing at all, fine, I'll go to grad school ASAP.  But, from previous responses mentioning that its possible, I want to try and see where I land.  Because to me, I would be more satisfied working 2-3 years in industry and then going to grad school. 

I know you meant well with your response and wanted to help so I thank you."

careerguidance,fehjgo2,t1_fehhqhb,1579117791.0,"Yeah, so I really liked the work I did during the internship (that sort of solidified my desire to work in the field) but there were aspects of the job I didn't like (how people treated me, the lack of mentorship).  Asked my manager if say I took the opportunity after graduation, whether the work would be the same, he said it would be the same expectations and similar type of work.  Thing is that he was talking about how he mentored another kid, fresh-out-of-high-school , and helped that kid develop his start in the field.  I think he may have seen me the same way except that kid sounds way smarter than I am.  The problem is that hes busy all the time so he didn't really mentor me.  I'm not ruling out going back to this company but I'm considering other options first.      

Also yes, this position would definitely help me build the necessary skills for the career I want to have."

Pretty sure this is what I want to do, considering that I also plan to do my masters in this field.... also, people who aren't passionate/interested in their job leave all the time.  One of the interns I worked with wanted to be historian but her parents pushed her into engineering due to concerns about money.  She complained all the time about how bored she is at the position that I'm interested/passionate about."
careerguidance,fehgi9g,t1_fegnauz,1579116059.0,"1.  I would say somewhere between 20% - 40% match with the job descriptions (including mention of soft skills).  I've been applying specifically to entry-level positions where I at least meet this range of criteria.  I've been doing online learning for most of the things I need to know for this job, derived directly from job openings I'm interested in and from advice given by people in the appropriate technical subreddits.

2.  My best bet will be probably Linkedin for this then.  I just checked and my school has something similar so I will use that as well.  Thank you, I will reach out! 

3.  My school doesn't have any organizations that do projects directly related to what I want to do (I ended up joining other clubs that do projects slightly related).  I will look around for more professional events.  (the ones I found on meetup were abandoned)"

careerguidance,feg0ui3,t1_feg09kr,1579072131.0,"> Do you know anyone with the job that you want? If not, do you know anyone that might know someone?

I do not unfortunately know anyone who has the job I want nor do I know anyone that might know someone. I've asked around via friends and family but no one knows someone who fits that description.  Also, I find it tough to ask someone to spend their free time, especially when they're already working, to help out a stranger follow their passion in life.  At my internship, I received very little mentorship which scares me as people keep saying that I need mentorship especially since I'm coming in from a weaker background.  

>does your school have a professor that you could talk to? Does your school have a career counseling office?

I spoke with the 2 professors at the Electrical and Computer Engineering departments at my school who have a background in the field but they're not nice/patient people.  They refused to answer my questions and told me to stop wasting their time because I wasn't majoring in the ""right degree"".  I've visited my school's career counseling office for alumni referrals and such but they have not been helpful at all, aside from general job searching/resume building help."

How much experience are we talking here and are these medium-large companies or small?  I'm the ""math"" guy trying to land a job in embedded software with 3 months of internship experience and a few embedded projects under my belt.  Formally, I learned C/C++/OOP through courses and took Electricity and Magnetism but everything else after that has been self-taught.

I've heard quite a couple of cases where people, who didn't have the ""right"" degree (aka not EE/CE/CS or similar), having to work a different job and asking their respective embedded department for either extra work or mentorship and once they got many years of experience (equivalent to a degree), they were able to transfer to embedded internally."
