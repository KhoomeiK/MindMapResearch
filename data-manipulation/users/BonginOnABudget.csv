electricians,fg6f787,t1_fg6f48u,1580566219.0,I guess the EZ anchors. Spiral aluminum anchor that drills in to the Sheetrock. I’ve never even heard them called anything other than “pig dicks” at my company and this is my first company in the trade
electricians,fg6eb1g,t1_fg6daxw,1580565424.0,Well we call sheet rock anchors and screws “pig dicks”. What do you call that?

He’s about 6 weeks out on his jman test and to his credit, the victim of the situation was supposed to be on his way to the shop for materials. He thought he left already and didn’t see his legs sticking out of the ceiling. It was just one of those freak things."

OculusQuest,fg14qox,t3_ew8lu2,1580420716.0,So I bought Arizona Sunshine and after about 30 minutes every time I’d log in I had huge white pixels covering any of the textures my headset was trying to display. Have they fixed that yet?

nhl,ffy2i8e,t3_evpq81,1580337318.0,Floyd Mayweather did this to me. He came and did a meet and greet at the bar I used to work at. I set up the whole place for the event. Built a Sort of stage for him and his money team. He signed a contract to sign all these shitty red fake gloves for anyone who bought a ticket. We tried to get him to sign my actual gloves which were black and he looked at them and threw them back on the table. Also stiffed his waitress. I didn’t want your signature anyways Floyd.
electricians,ffwkc1a,t3_evfukn,1580303760.0,Still pretty green here and I mainly do commercial remodels. Anyone care to clue me in as to what’s going on? Is he using his drill to test if there’s power to the compactor motor by rigging it up?
AskReddit,ffv1rst,t1_fftleql,1580253701.0,“I ain’t going no where” by Luke Combs kills me every time. I lost my dad to cancer growing up and it’s been about 17 years but songs to this effect will have me bawling like a big bearded baby in my truck. It doesn’t help that this song is super popular and gets played every day on my favorite station.

gtaonline,ffgtsgm,t1_ffgqy7y,1579914868.0,That’s not the issue. The issue is the overall take went down before I had the chance to absorb all the lead.

OculusQuest,ff7cmo3,t3_erz7qt,1579646445.0,"My first experience was a boxing game on a friends vive. I played for about two rounds and spent the next two hours curled up on the couch trying not to throw up. Now I can pretty much play any game without getting motion sickness. I did exactly as you described (take a break as soon as you feel the nausea coming on and trying again in like 15-30 minutes) and over time I’ve noticed less and less instances. I hope your tolerance improves friend.
 
Edit: also idk if you partake or not but in my case, cannabis helps with motion sickness and definitely ups the immersion of whatever I’m playing."

tifu,fejoyra,t1_fejbl5p,1579182051.0,Same. At our bar we had girls who took the table and girls who bussed the table. On multiple occasions guys leave notes or numbers on receipts and everyone generally would have a laugh about it but the receipt always went to the server because they have to report everything at the end of the night.

1. Go to Pavlov discord

2. Go to #quest_installation

3. Download build 22

4. Extract full download to new folder on desktop

5. Enable dev mode on headset and plug into pc via usb -C

6. Run install.bat in extracted desktop folder. 

At this point you should see a command prompt with a percentage running your apk to the headset

Some guy on the Pavlov discord sat with me for 3 hours and helped me download the first build when it came out so I thought I’d pass it on. Thank you @Virus you will never be forgotten."
