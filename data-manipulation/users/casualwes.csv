plants,ffnsv13,t3_euc0y0,1580070340.0,"It looks like mealy bugs to me. Idk the best approach here, but rubbing alcohol has worked for very minor infestations for me. I would isolate it and give it a few passes over a few days or so, checking each leaf and crevice, wiping the bugs and white stuff off."
plantclinic,ffno0py,t1_ffn5qqk,1580068373.0,"You’ll want to make sure it’s getting lots of light. Not much (if any) direct sunlight, but definitely close to a window — a clear view of the sky — or within about a foot from a grow light. Probably about 12-16hrs per day if possible. Proper light is usually priority number one for any plant, as the amount of water it uses will depend on the amount of light it gets. Hope that helps!

Edit: close to a window = within a foot or two depending on how bright the window is. The further you get, the less intense the light. This effect can be surprisingly drastic."
plantclinic,ffmsc1w,t3_eu6cm6,1580058362.0,"I have had some luck with a couple pomegranate seedlings. I use “tropical” soil (well draining) or peat moss, very small pots (helps keep it from getting too moist), and a grow light. I water when the top of the soil looks dry. I also aerate the soil before every second watering — very gently close to the base of the stem with a toothpick (or you can use something more blunt if you have it). Aerating seems to have helped me fight off root rot that has got to some of my previous attempts. Just make sure you use a fresh/clean aeration tool! And anything that touches the seedling/soil should be as sterile as possible to avoid infecting with mold. 

Hope that helps!"
