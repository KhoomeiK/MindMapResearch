cats,fes8e8y,t3_eqhjas,1579362498.0,"I used to have to give my cat multiple pills twice per day. This is what I would do:

-Get a pill popper from your vet. 

-Get pill pockets but tear off a small piece of pill pocket roll it between your fingers to flatten it. 

-Take the pill and place in the flatten pill pocket piece and then roll it up so the pill is inside. This will disguise the bitter taste of the pill. 

-Place that in the pill popper

-With the cat on the floor, stand behind him. You are doing this because cats love to back up when you give the pill. So by being behind him, you can sort of jam him or hold him in place between you calf’s/knees so he can’t back out

-Lean forward and tip his head up, insert the pill popper and pop to the back of the tongue

-Now after he takes the pill give him some fresh chicken, tuna, or whatever his fave treat is.

I have done this for two years and my cat would actually wait for me around pill  time because he knew if he cooperated he would get a treat immediately afterwards. So it was a win - win for both of us!"
RecPics,felwdks,t3_eputfp,1579232594.0,"This is a great CBD strain. It is grown in St Stephen NB by Affirma. Purchased in Saint John NB. The buds were dark and sticky. The taste when vaped was minty and orange peels sort of taste. The effects are a wonderful relaxed but energetic vibe, and good arm tingles. Definitely will be getting again."

cats,fczwicz,t3_ejqgq0,1578109816.0,I have 2 dogs and 2 cats and they share water bowls. I think it’s a cat thing to want to drink the dogs water. I think it’s perfectly normal.

dogs,fctch2s,t3_eit3i9,1577938949.0,I found having the in their kennel where the pup can see you helps them relax. But the barking at night took a few nights. I wore earbuds to drown it out so I could sleep.
