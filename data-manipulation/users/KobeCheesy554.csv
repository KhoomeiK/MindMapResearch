trichotillomania,fdgfkwc,t3_el921h,1578394517.0,"Hey there bro, I’m 13 rn and have been repeatedly shaved my head multiple times. And honestly. If you let people know that shaving your head is an important thing for your life people might understand and maybe even support you. There’s also a person on this sub who posted a suggestion about taking NAC. So try that if you’d rather keep you hair. Either choice is yours. Cutting down hair is nothing to be afraid of. It’s normal and okay. Despite the bullying I endure at school, I also have supporters to back me when I need it the most. Hope this helped!"
