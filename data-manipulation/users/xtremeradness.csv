Stadia,ffunenp,t1_ffucx32,1580245623.0,"Thanks for a response. Personally I would like to see mandatory 4K 60FPS streaming for all titles. I understand this has been said to be developer-mandated, but that's what Stadia Pro was initially suggested to include service-wide. I feel like the cop out way of saying 4K60 was referring to the video encoding is shady at best. Stadia Pro, as it currently exists, is not worth it without consistent delivery of quality.

Some sort of incentive for developers to make supporting Stadia is also crucial IMO. Many games are running old, outdated versions and word of mouth is very negative about this. 

Really, the number one ""feature"" I'd like to see is clarity and openness of communication with customers. I would argue videogame enthusiasts understand development complications more than most demographics. Relaying information to them, even if it's bad news or almost no news at all (like saying ""we hit a snag in development and hope to have feature X ready by Y date), is very important and will keep good faith with players.

If you're looking for communication being key to a service's success, look at something like Rainbow Six Siege. Their community hasn't slowed a bit even though the game is years old by now. Even though that's a game and Stadia is a platform, the same people that listen to Ubisoft will listen to Google as long as they feel like they're being kept in the loop and not being lied to.

I really do want Stadia to succeed. The technology is fascinating and excellent, and making the initial investment more affordable for lower income demographics is huge and even somewhat noble in a way. I am cautiously optimistic of what's to come. I really hope Google can succeed."
