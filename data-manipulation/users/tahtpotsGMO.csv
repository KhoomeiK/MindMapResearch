funny,ff9ugsq,t3_esc35e,1579721620.0,"There is an easy way to lucid dream: go to bed at 11 or 12p. m. Set an alarm for 3a.m.  Wake up, turn it off, remembering why you set the alarm, and go back to sleep while using your imagination to continue the scenario of the dream you had (you will remember the dream when u wake up this way, so it will be easier to fall asleep while playing the scenario in your mind) but keep in mind at all times that it's a dream.   You will be able to lucid dream on your 2nd or 3rd try almost certainly (maybe even 1st try, but don't get high hopes)"

Theories_on_Anything,ff5bvhe,t3_erq3ex,1579586602.0," I used to have the same thing with ""same number multiple times"" a while back. Once you notice it, you look for it, and you end up seeing it more often, without realising it. What you also don't realise is how many other number combinations you didn't notice. Basically, you make yourself see it more often, and filter out of your mind all the other times when you didn't see the same number in a row. 
 As for the song, perhaps it was a popular song. No idea, never heard of it. 
As for the movie and the connection to your accident, why didn't you also die? 

You make these connections yourself, because you wanna believe you have a guardian angel. If he was guarding you, why did you get in the accident in the first place? So he is powerful enough to give you all these signs, including but not limited to :broadcasting a TV series for months or years, so that it can sync with the day of your accident, making you dream of shit, and stopping you from dieing, but not from getting in a crash.  

Your angel sounds to me like an ass, if he has all this power, God says you're gonna die, and then the angel steps in and goes against God. Or you were never gonna die, in which case he/she didn't step it. Or is just a coincidence that happens all the time, and you wanna give it a more special twist based on some random, unrelated things you decided make part of a bigger plan"

instantkarma,feog8gk,t1_fenbwhr,1579299683.0,"You know why asshole skip lanes and try to merge at the front in heavy traffic conditions? Because nobody does anything about it, and nobody challenges them besides the occasional horn. I totally side with the cam guy. I wouldn't do it if I was in his place, because I care more about my car than to prove a point, but I love that he did it. Let's face it, doing a complaint to the police won't do shit to him, and he will go on his merry way being an asshole another day again.

There was an incident in Bucharest (Romania) with a BMW that was blocking the tramway line, and the driver of the tramway just jently hit the BMW a couple of times (there is a video of it so u can look it up). 90% of Facebook sided with the tramway driver, and they even shared pictures of the BMW the next few days without a bumper and avoiding all tramway lines"
