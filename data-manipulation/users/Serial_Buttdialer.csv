dogs,ffgwlfk,t1_ffguike,1579916910.0,"Deliberately cutting the nail *very* short under sedation (into the quick) is typically done when the owner requests it, not voluntarily. It's usually because either the owner wants to get them short very quickly or because the dog is absolutely awful at getting clipped out of sedation, so they've left it a long while. Even when nails grow into coils or curves or break into the pad, they can (surprisingly) usually be clipped into a more normal shape/size without actually cutting into the quick.

However, if so, they then need to be regularly clipped (i.e. every week) in order to keep them that length and reduce the length further. A lot of owners either don't have time/money for this or can't do it with the reaction their dog has. It's a bit of a toss up as to whether this is actually a necessary surgery though, when you have alternatives like scratch boards, counter conditioning, dremels/files and others."
dogs,ffgsuip,t3_etjo3a,1579914180.0,"I've not had it done on my own dog but I've volunteered in veterinary clinics and watched it/learned about it. Most of the vets felt it was very inhumane and did not like doing it. It was very painful for the dogs since not only are you cutting into blood vessels and nerves, you're also cauterising and/or pressing hard on it with a silver nitrate pen and it will continue to be painful for a while until the nail heals. Also, if a dog needs this done, the likelihood is that it will have to happen again, since it's usually because they are too difficult to clip out of sedation.

A far better idea is to teach your dog to [scratch a board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VL3uti1WDE) with sandpaper taped to it. That will file down the front nails. Weirdly, dogs are often better with having their back nails cut, so if you're struggling to teach a [back nail scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5YNovDn1Uc), you may get away with having an experienced groomer clip those."

While obviously for the longer obedience stays we want something quite relaxed - and I will keep rewarding in a very relaxed way (gonna use 'niiiice' as a new stay-there marker and deliver every treat to his mouth) - right now it's helpful to have that anticipation in order to teach the concept of duration stays.

Is that so that we spend time working on general impulse control with the aim of transferring it to down stays later on?

So true and that hadn't properly occurred to me. Confidence is a big thing for both whippets and iggies so that will definitely be key in training this. As you say, making criteria really clear and being conscious of stress should help.

For the last couple of months, I've been taking along a piece of vet bed to every class I go to with Reuben and rewarding him for offering a down on it. He spends quite a bit of time either sitting or downing on his vet bed now while we're waiting for our turn, which I've been hoping will help with training a more formal obedience down stay. I always deliver food directly to his mouth or place it between his elbows, but I've been using my usual marker (yes) rather than a distinct room-service marker. I've also been trying to release before he gets up, but it can be tricky sometimes since I'm not actually cueing him to down and if I wait too long between treats (say over 10 seconds) he might get up himself. 

So I guess my extra questions are:

1. Should I be cueing him into a down every time while we wait between goes?
2. If he gets up without being released, do I just lure him back into a down and reward that? Cue him again? Something else? If I wait for him to go back himself without luring/cueing, it starts to reward a ping-pong effect of him thinking it's okay to get up so long as he goes back and obviously I want that constant duration.

For good citizen and KC obedience, you return to your dog and stand in heel position before releasing them. Good point about practicing that."
