I think the best reason for the shape of a manhole cover is to match the shape of the manhole. A circular cover is a pretty shit way to cover a square manhole."
todayilearned,fcmpy6k,t1_fcmlo4q,1577786427.0,"Exactly. Let's aim a gun a target. The accuracy will depend not only on how calibrated the weapon is, but also on random events (you're likely going to move your arm around a little, the wind might change, the projectiles likely aren't perfect, etc etc).

How calibrated the gun is would be bias. If it aims left, it'll always aim left. Meanwhile random events will move it in all directions. 

Thus, accuracy is total error. It is more than just bias, it's also got that random element to it."

I'm not sure why you'd expect similar effort from the staff of a company that truly cares for their workers and one that doesn't. You're crazy if you think it shouldn't matter. If you want my best then I expect to be suitably compensated. 

Thankfully my employer understands this. I'm grateful I don't work for the likes of you where people expect maximum effort for minimum wage.

TLDR: People will work harder for more money."
funny,fcmkary,t1_fcmiwjt,1577778774.0,"Yeah, if I were a slave on minimum wage I'd work really hard for it too. Seriously though, people typically aren't stuck on minimum wage because they are lazy.

And I doubt anyone is getting a promotion in the courier business because they hide packages well.   

You get what you pay for. If companies pay minimum wage they really shouldn't expect too much in return for it.   

Why work hard for a company that doesn't respect you? Find a better employer, and then reward them by being a better employee."

todayilearned,fcmi8jr,t1_fckxfpd,1577776314.0,"Woops, deleted entire post above trying to edit it. But I was right. Precision = Variance. 
Accuracy = Error. 

Bias is systemic, but your accuracy will depend on both systemic issues and random variation. So accuracy is more than bias, its total error.

>The most common precision measure is the variance.

>A common accuracy measure called mean square error (MSE) is the mean of the squared differences.

todayilearned,fcmem4q,t1_fcm9dt2,1577772448.0,"I think 'everyone is an idiot' is a good starting point. But I'd say older people are the bigger idiots. Youngens are fresh out of school and many are still actively studying/learning. Youngens are far more likely to adapt their ways and beliefs when challenged than oldies who are stubbornly set in their ways. 

Plus most adults, and especially most oldies, do very little to continue learning or really anything to keep their brains active. Very rarely (if ever) will an adult ever test their knowledge, choosing instead to just believe that they are right (often on topics they know absolutely nothing about). Plus a lot of what they do know is well out of date. 

The reason older people often seem smarter is they have learnt it is better to remain silent, and risk people thinking they are stupid, than to open their mouths and remove any doubt.  

Go to the average oldies club and I'd be very surprised if you left thinking what a wise group of people. The typical response is often reassuring yourself that thankfully they'll all be dead soon."
