GYM,fffuieu,t1_fff4sso,1579892080.0,"You will adapt and become better able to deal with the stress. Whether you'll ever be able to recover optimally is another thing.

If you are fatigued to the point that it's affecting your ability in deadlift or other lifts to the point that you feel it's detrimental then you need to recover better. This happens through a) giving yourself less to recover from b) giving yourself more time to recover c) improving your rate of recovery.

Note the below is tailored for strength not pure hypertrophy. 

My advice is to compare your deadlift capability over time by looking at your outputs. If you're going backwards in deadlift or other lifts it's likely that you're burnt out. If you're lifting less weight or doing fewer reps over the next few weeks then change things.

You could:
- make one of your deadlift days a less taxing alternative
- deadlift for a different purpose on one of your days. Overload is not the only effective way 
- stop doing a 6 day ppl split
- clean up your nutrition
- sleep better
- stretch and foam roll
- hot and cold therapy"

GYM,feuhhb6,t1_fesgekf,1579386589.0,I think my first question before I can give any advice is why have you chosen to do that particular program? What are the reasons behind your decision to do those exercises for those specified sets and reps and on those splits? Is there a reason why you have designed the program in the way it is or is this something that you may have found on the internet and thought it looked like something you wanted to do?
GYM,feqvhef,t3_eqf2bn,1579346524.0,"I don't think that you should stop doing something which you've noticed amazing results, gains and strength from. You should, in general, keep with a program that's delivering until you stop making progress.

By SL do you mean stronglifts? I've run this a couple of times. It's a great program and most likely you'll never be able to increase by such large increments at that pace again so take advantage.

Putting up your 5 rep max by 2.5kg a week is huge... Its 130kg per year. You'll never actually manage that but run it until you start to fail.
When you do fail you need to be realistic in your analysis. Is it that you aren't doing enough upper body work? Or is it that you can't recover fast enough? Add in some bits and bobs if you like but make sure they're smart choices. Chins and dips work well for stronglifts because it's so easy to overload yourself with accessories when at this point your only focus should be hitting all the reps on your latest, heaviest weight.

Personally I think the 6 day PPL you've suggested above is pretty awful. It's hard to say as you aren't listing your specific goals but I really don't think that program is the most effective way to meet any goal.

Try replying to this comment with SMART goals. I'll try to come back with constructive help. However, even if you don't like my help then I think that for anyone setting a new program the most important thing they can do is take a step back and set down on paper what they are really trying to achieve. Be as specific as possible when setting these goals. Use the SMART format. Otherwise, how the fuck will you know if you are achieving what you want to?"

I don't think you'd care much for any photos. Like I say, I'm overweight. My point is that he's not impressive because he's a huge guy and that size is difficult to obtain it's because of his conditioning. The comment I originally replied to made out it was incredibly difficult to have his size. I honestly don't think he's so enormous that one would need drugs to be that big. Looking like him is a different matter but in terms of pure size he isn't that big."
bodybuilding,fegu4d9,t1_fegfe5q,1579102578.0,"I'm 1.81m, so a fraction under 6'0"" in imperial.

He's 85kg (187lb), so if you're 100kg + (220lb) and you're <20% body fat then you've got more lean mass than him. There's a hell of a lot of guys at my gym, my rugby club, my strongman comps, even regular guys who don't compete in any sports who are walking around with more lean mass than that. 

I'm in no way saying that his physique isn't impressive. It really is. I was just saying that I don't think that size alone is what's difficult to achieve here. It's difficult to achieve whilst being that low body fat, having great proportions and a number of other factors. Not just size alone. He's a the top of his sport as an all around package but he's not an outlier in society for straight up muscle mass."
bodybuilding,fegstxj,t1_fegsa9i,1579101733.0,"I can't understand your maths here. I'm approx 88kg of lean mass, plus the fat. Lean + fat = total. So if I cut down to 8% (somehow cutting without lean losses) I'd be 88kg lean mass + 8% bf.

Anyway, the second half of your statement is exactly the point I'm making. The combination of size and low bf% is what is impressive. The size isn't so difficult to obtain, it's the conditioning. There are loads of people walking around with the same amount of lean mass, like shit loads of people. It's not impressive though because they're almost all, like me, fat."
bodybuilding,fegf626,t1_feg9ll5,1579090672.0,"I really don't think that the size is particularly unachievable. It's the shape, balance, proportions and bf% which is the incredible achievement.

For example, I have nowhere near the fantastic body he's achieved. But I do have more muscle mass. Google says he's 85kg, I'd say he's at about 10% body fat. Maybe less, let's call it 8% or even a little less. That gives him a max lean tissue mass of about 78kg. I'm 116kg at 24%. I'm chubby, to be expected in strongman. Big, lots of muscle but kinda fat. This means that I'm 88kg of lean tissue. More size than him no matter how you look at it. 

 I don't think his size is really that difficult to reach, its the size whilst lean."

I can recognise the futility of all this. I'll wish you good luck with your faith. Personally, I find that the sort of mental gymnastics that are required to explain away how 3 people are the same person and also different people and the same god, just make me even more sceptical. Answers that don't make any sense make some people feel like because it doesn't make sense it's more likely to be true. For me it has the opposite effect.

To be honest it probably stems back to my priest. When I would ask ""how does that work? How can X be true when it directly conflicts with Y?"" and I'd usually get an answer along the lines of ""that is the mystery of faith"" or something explaining patronisingly that I'm required to believe without any evidence because that is what faith is. Or that God works in mysterious ways and how could I possibly hope to understand.

It doesn't do it for me. I won't change the way I live my life for something that I think is incredibly unlikely to be true. So I'll say God be with you."

GYM,fed6d9q,t3_eo85h7,1579001058.0,"Firstly, great job. 
I see a lot of comments on here saying that you should be putting more weight on the bar. It's true that it looks like you could lift far more. Don't worry about that. If you continue to incrementally increase what you're lifting then you are continually improving which is great. Yeah, you probably could pull 100kg next week but continuing as you are and lifting 72.5kg next week is a great approach.

You look like the technique may be fairly new to you but you're doing it extremely proficiently. Your technique looks exactly the same in this video as the last one. You are methodical about your set up and do things exactly the same each time (and it's safe and correct). Great! You see so many people lifting well at 70% and then picking up all kinds of terrible habits when they push themselves hard, chasing numbers, before the technical side is ingrained as second nature.

Keep up the 2.5kg increases! I promise in a year of that you'll be lifting more than if you jump up to a max now. And what's more, you'll be lifting it correctly. Patience is an underrated trait in powerlifting.

Again, great job."

Firstly, I expect that this donation can be made into a tax write off and so have zero impact on after tax profits. Plus, its not 1M in cash, its 1M worth of the company's goods and services. If they're sending, I don't know, a first aid kit - his 1M is referring to the $20 sale value of the product not the $10 it costs amazon. So it really is quite different from that money coming from his personal funds.

Do the right things from the start! Stronglifts 5x5 is a really good way to get people started on the right track. There's a strong focus on technique from the start and it really helps people to learn the most important exercises and how to do them well when there's only 5 of them.
