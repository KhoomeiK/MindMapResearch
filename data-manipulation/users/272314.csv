worldnews,fflfyy7,t1_ffldorz,1580039165.0,"Agreed. It's not really ""logic"", it's certainly selfish, but ideally we'd live in a society where we align people's self-interest (in not getting fired) with infection control. I'm sure the parent would ultimately prefer staying home with their kid too.

Ultimately, even those people keeping their children home are selfish. If they donated the money they made working just a few days to an effective charity overseas they could save lives. I bought my kid a computer for Christmas, that same amount of money could have saved an entire child's life if donated to Deworm the World [https://www.givewell.org/charities/deworm-world-initiative](https://www.givewell.org/charities/deworm-world-initiative) instead. We as a society understand that people are selfish when it comes to their own kids and you can't really change that, so we need to adapt our society to that reality by trying to make it so there isn't so much conflict between self-interest and hurting others."

worldnews,ffl9bea,t1_ffl8mr6,1580036701.0,">even a 1% mortality rate could might even be somewhat of a large stretch.

I agree 1% could easily be high. It was example, but I should have made that clear.

>this disease has supposedly been running around since November of last year.

~~Do you mean November of this year? I haven't seen anyone say that. Everything I've seen suggests this is quite recent.~~ Edit: I'm an idiot and forgot it's 2020 now. 

That said, we won't have a reliable origin date until we have more genomes sequenced. We're up to 28 as of today, a week ago we had only 5 genomes. We simply don't have the data to make a claim about this at all yet."
worldnews,ffl7l09,t1_ffl0cdr,1580035993.0,"Yup. This is a very bad from a public health standpoint. Punitive measures actually prevent people from seeking healthcare, thereby spreading it among their contacts even farther. 

We already know this from HIV criminalisation, people deliberately don't get tested so they can just claim ignorance. Whereas people who are treated for HIV have undetectable levels and basically can't spread it.  It spreads disease, rather than stops it."
worldnews,ffl6m92,t1_ffkyv91,1580035495.0,"It's not blown out of proportion in the sense that it's a new disease that does kill people. If it has a 1% fatality rate, and then everyone in the world gets infected, that's 70 million dead.

It's not \*just\* about how deadly it is, it's about how \*many\* people get it.

People have an intuitive sense that a deadlier disease, like ebola, is worse than a less deadly disease. This is true in an individual sense; one would rather get swine flu than ebola, so of course transmitting it seems not as bad too.

But that intuition, when applied to a global scale, is wrong. More than 500,000 people have died so far of swine flu. Only 12,000 people died of ebola.

You can easily have more people die of this new coronavirus than ebola, if it spreads more widely."
worldnews,ffl5ats,t1_ffkzcro,1580035056.0,"In general I agree. I think everyone should be staying home more when sick, kids, adults at work, etc. I always keep my kids home when they're sick.

That said, I have a really flexible job where I can work whatever the hours I want and from home. Most salaried jobs have sick time that you can take off for a sick kid too but it's a little harder because sometimes you have a limited number of days and it's just not enough. If you're married or have parents that are local you can sometimes offload your kid onto them too, but not everyone has that.

If you're a single parent doing hourly shift work, sometimes you literally cannot afford to miss work without getting fired. So I can see why keeping a kid home sick can be a difficult decision. Especially since kids get sick constantly in school... I'm talking 10+ times a year, and then depending on the disease it can be for weeks at a time!

Generally speaking you can't even pay someone to take care of your sick kid, there are emergency nanny services but they usually require a subscription and are absurdly expensive and only available in large cities.

In the UK we don't vaccinate against chicken pox. I had my kids vaccinated privately. I made back the money I spent easily when it burned through the year 1 classroom and the other parents had to keep their kids home for weeks at a time, but mine were at school. But most parents don't do that because it's not available under the NHS and they just assume the NHS knows best."

As far as I know, no one has a problem with using the word female as an adjective.

You don't have to erase the word ""female"" from your vocabulary, that would be weird. Then we'd need to invent a new adjective, like ""womanly"" or something, to mean female."
gaming,ffbss6c,t1_ffbpk56,1579781398.0,"I do not, because male is usually an adjective. I am not a female. I am female. Similarly, you can be male, but you are not a male. Using female and male as nouns just sounds weird. 

If you wanted to use male or female in the plural, you could say something like ""the male sex"" or ""male humans"" rather than ""males"". They all sound a bit weird though, which is why people just tend to go with ""men."" Of course ""man"" implies an adult, so it's not a perfect solution either, and then people say ""men and boys."""
