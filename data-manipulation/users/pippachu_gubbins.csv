UpliftingNews,ffblfgx,t1_ffbi7ao,1579771069.0,"To start, being transgender isn't a sexual orientation. A transgender person may be asexual, gynosexual, or any orientation, regardless of their gender.

Usually therapy for a transgender person begins by establishing the person's feelings. Why do they feel they may be trans? How long have these feelings been going on? Is there something else going on that may have confused them?

Once the doctors have confirmed the person is indeed trans, the option of various treatments opens up. For children this is limited to social transitioning (asking other students and teachers to use their correct pronoun) and delayed puberty. For older teens and adults (varies by age of majority) options include hormone replacement therapy, surgical procedures, and vocal training.

At no point during any of these proceedings does anyone attempt to make the person believe anything about themselves, whether they're cis or trans. The goal of the therapy is to reach the truth about the person."

Awwducational,ff5mx65,t1_ff453fj,1579600917.0,"Domestication does not take that long. Foxes, rats, and pigeons have been domesticated within recent history.

There are some animals which do very poorly in captivity, and we obviously shouldn't keep those. But then there are others which show indications of good health when adequately cared for: grooming, breeding, and generally being social and active with healthy coats. Why not domesticate these? Animals which live alongside humans in friendly relationships have better and longer lives than those left to disease, predation, and injury in the wild."
