Also some amphet but you probably don't need it, i used it a few times with my friend last week and it just slimmed the last of my double chin lol. Thanks a lot and good luck to you :)"
progresspics,fbztih8,t3_efdtf7,1577260721.0,"I was fat most of my life, as the years were passing I wasn't losing the weight and my depression kept getting worse. Coming across this picture on the same day it was taken last year lifted my spirits waaaaay up high. Fuck being fat and fuck depression, I'm tired of letting my mind control how I feel and always making me feel like shit. In 2019 I did my best, I worked really hard and my work paid off. Thank you for reading."
