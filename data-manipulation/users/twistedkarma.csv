Here's a blurb from [Climbing Magazine](https://www.climbing.com/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-knots/) with info on a couple knots, but it's good to know more. 

> The strongest tie-in knot you can use is the figure-eight follow-through, which, when pull-tested, breaks at 75 to 80 percent of the rope’s full strength. The bowline is a slightly weaker knot, at 70 to 75 percent, followed by the double fisherman’s at 65 to 70 percent. The clove hitch is the weakest of the common climbing knots, at 60 to 65 percent. Note, however, that modern climbing ropes have a tensile strength of upwards of 6,000 pounds, so even a clove hitch would fail at something like 3,600 pounds. The elasticity of climbing ropes makes that amount of force virtually impossible to generate in reallife scenarios

As the article says, it's hard to generate enough force to break a climbing rope due to elasticity, but it is possible. In most anchor situations a clove hitch is fine. 


Knots relying on a rope or webbing cinching around itself (like a girth hitch) can relatively easily generate enough friction to cut or burn through the webbing. Girth hitches are fine for a personal attachment, but should never hold the load of a falling climber."

Here's a blurb from [Climbing Magazine](https://www.climbing.com/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-knots/) with info on a couple knots, but it's good to know more. 

> The strongest tie-in knot you can use is the figure-eight follow-through, which, when pull-tested, breaks at 75 to 80 percent of the ropeâ€™s full strength. The bowline is a slightly weaker knot, at 70 to 75 percent, followed by the double fishermanâ€™s at 65 to 70 percent. The clove hitch is the weakest of the common climbing knots, at 60 to 65 percent. Note, however, that modern climbing ropes have a tensile strength of upwards of 6,000 pounds, so even a clove hitch would fail at something like 3,600 pounds. The elasticity of climbing ropes makes that amount of force virtually impossible to generate in reallife scenarios

As the article says, it's hard to generate enough force to break a climbing rope due to elasticity, but it is possible. In most anchor situations a clove hitch is fine. 


Knots relying on a rope or webbing cinching around itself (like a girth hitch) can relatively easily generate enough friction to cut or burn through the webbing. Girth hitches are fine for a personal attachment, but should never hold the load of a falling climber."
