But you won't know how it's going to turn out if you don't try. So if there's someone in your life you want to be with then just go for it. Rejection sucks, but so does endlessly wondering if you should've gone for it. And who knows, maybe they're supportive and it'll work out."

It's okay to change majors! Follow what you what to do, what you enjoy studying. 

Don't sweat grades too much. That was way to easy to panic about GPA, which is important but the more I worried about it the worse I did. It's okay to get a C in a course or two. It's okay to withdraw when you took too many courses in one semester. You can explain those things to employers and grad school administration when the time comes and so far I've found them to be very understanding.

Spend time connecting with your department and the professors in it. Networking can do a lot more for you than good grades. It's a great way to get into research or internships that build experience employers are looking for after you graduate. Plus fellow students in your major are a great resource for studying, advice, and support. I've made some life long connections along the way.

This is really hard, especially since we've got a mental illness, but try to not be stressed. Try to enjoy the learning experience. Granted there was plenty of times I was super stressed and did not enjoy it. But stressing got in the way of learning and it's just not worth the energy, better to keep pushing on and keep focused on the end goal, your degree. It's okay to take mental health days when you need to help with this, so do it!

selfharm,fe67al4,t1_fe643w3,1578883392.0,"when I said it's not like that for the majority of people I wasn't being exclusive, it wasn't meant to be about just those that self harm but everyone. People have a hard time understanding that cutting can be a pleasurable feeling. And yes, I was addicted to cocaine for years and struggled to get clean but made it through. You're right in that most people with addiction problems (self harm included) aren't publicly open about it, but some of us are. I share with those I feel are open to listen about my self harming, in those instances most people are pretty accepting of me just in the same way as when I share about my past drug addiction. But it also seems that to society, people can understand the allure of doing drugs or drinking but not cutting because they don't understand how cutting can be a pleasurable thing. In that, they can't relate.  You can describe being addicted to cocaine to some one and they can sort of get it, as it's relatable to drinking in that it's substance abuse. Trying to describe being addicted to cutting is much more difficult, at least in my experience, and people don't have much in the way of relating it to something they might do themselves.  Even explaining that I smoke cigarettes as a form of self harm gets a different reaction than explaining I cut to self harm.  People can find relatable experiences to substance abuse more easily than they can to corporeal abuse."

So they are not really seen in an abusive light because they're so common place. Self-starving is definitely looked down upon though, anorexia is rather taboo.  As for sleep deprivation I think people aren't too aware that some use that as a form of self harm, and since its pretty common for people to have experienced troubles sleeping they can sympathize with it more easily than cutting."
