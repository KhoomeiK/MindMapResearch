The UCs need to do a complete rehaul of the mental health system to actually support the >230,000 students in the UC system.

Edit: I'd like it if they gave the option to speak to a licensed therapist/counselor instead of just grad students trying to complete their hours."

cscareerquestions,fef1821,t1_fef02uz,1579045781.0,"That's fair. For some reason I thought github had a view tracker that counted repo visits or something but didn't log who visited.

Personally, I don't think people look during the screening process. I think they look after HR has given their initial selection of candidates to the hiring manager/interviewers/engineers. HR wouldn't even know what they're looking at."
cscareerquestions,fef0tos,t1_feducbv,1579045521.0,Networking is very underrated. I think a lot of people don't want to do it because they suck at talking to people or don't like talking to people.
cscareerquestions,feezyo3,t1_feez57a,1579044955.0,I'm not saying it isn't. I'm just saying I see this specific piece of advice a lot yet myself and my friends have never had people look at our githubs.
cscareerquestions,fedyp2m,t1_fedflqm,1579022689.0,"I hear this a lot, but I've never had anyone look at my github in my two years of applying."
UCDavis,fe5feuo,t3_enufx3,1578868840.0,"ECS 122AB, 163, 165AB, ECS 171, and possibly ECS 189G depending what it is are all good choices.

ECS 158 has a ton of other prereqs (ECS 154A, ECS 150) which require other classes (ECS 34, ECS 50). Don't forget to take ECS 20 if you want to take ECS 122A and ECS 34 if you want to take ECS 122B. I've heard ECS 163 is brutal, if you don't know javascript beforehand you might want to pick it up first.

If you can, take ECS 171 over STA 142A.

There's also some good MAT classes like MAT 160 and MAT 168.

To be completely honest, I feel like you'd be better prepared for data science if you majored in CS and minored in stats. At least at UC Davis.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask."
UCDavis,fdrh6d4,t1_fdr2b13,1578684513.0,"I feel like this needs a caveat. Most of the major/big companies (Big N, unicorns, etc) finish hiring by December. But there are still tons of companies looking for interns. Some Big N are still hiring as well (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, etc)."
UCDavis,fdp8qy5,t3_emjqa6,1578622647.0,"You won't get a degree for both, you just get one psychology degree. The tracks are transcript notations from what I understand. You could take the classes for both if you want."
AskStatistics,fdp1tva,t1_fdoqo49,1578617988.0,"The core classes are generally the same, but the difference lies in the electives. At my univerisity, the BA takes more upper division humanities requirements while the BS takers more upper division electives within the stats, math, or CS departments. This allows the students who obtain the BS to have a deeper technical understanding of the field."
college,fdls1p3,t1_fdljerm,1578531136.0,"But the number of people who make it into BB, IB, or HFT firms are very low. Not to mention it's one of the few industries that cares where you got your degree from."

UCDavis,fczut1u,t1_fczup0j,1578108979.0,I'm not sure which post you're referring to. You don't really give any details or information.
UCDavis,fczu1hv,t1_fcztogu,1578108606.0,That's not exactly proof. Can you link your LinkedIn or maybe share your official Intel email address for people to send their resumes and stuff to? That's what I mean by verifiable proof.
UCDavis,fczlyp1,t1_fczlno0,1578104126.0,Yeah I saw that too. It's why I asked for some kind of proof to make sure people didn't sent their personal info to a complete stranger.
UCDavis,fczk1sn,t3_ejp1fv,1578102941.0,"Don't take this the wrong way, but do you have some kind of proof or verification that you are affiliated with Intel and can help students?

cscareerquestions,fc6d69p,t1_fc6afaz,1577477788.0,Research or applied scientists at a FANG is my guess. You will most likely need a PhD or a MS and years of experience and/or publications to get these kinds of positions.
UCDavis,fc49q10,t1_fc48emi,1577410456.0,"I agree with this take. I've had friends tell me ECS 34 workload is comparable to upper division CS classes and is more difficult than some upper divs.

In my opinion, ECS 32AB does a poor job of preparing students for ECS 34. In my ECS 32B class I wrote *maybe* 250 lines of code. That's no where near enough to get familiar with data structures."
