AskReddit,fen0n2v,t1_femejv8,1579274314.0,"My mom, this. My dad made mid-six figures as a doctor, but the utilities people showed up to shut off the water for non-payment. Luckily my college friend was home and answered the door. SHE paid the water bill and told my dad later. He went ballistic and took the bill paying away from my mother. She just couldn't bring herself to write the big checks. My dad found that we were carrying balances on credit cards and only paying minimums on a bunch of bills, when he had hundreds of thousands in the bank. He paid off EVERYTHING, paid the water bill ahead for a year, etc. I thought my mom would have a coronary!!"

AskReddit,fe2u9f1,t1_fe2s7ux,1578842927.0,"It was bad. There were a lot of desperate people down south. Homestead was (is) a 'small town' area of Miami, far from the high-rises and rich areas. Andrew FLATTENED it. There were almost no landmarks/ buildings left. Four days after, we managed to get to my grandparents to bring them supplies (they refused to leave) and got lost finding our way back to the checkpoints to head back north. We literally couldn't recognise our way back, and my grandparents had lived there my entire life. The landscape was alien. Plus, you had roving bands of people, including armed patrols, walking around in broad daylight. It was surreal. We dropped our supplies and booked it back up to Kendall."

My sister was a police officer working the Homestead area. No, the NG wasn't shooting looters, but homeowners were! The official death toll were all lies to protect tourism. She saw more bodies in the wreckage of her patrol area alone than the official totals of the time."
AskReddit,fe2o545,t1_fe2gvao,1578841085.0,"I have lived here in Miami since '88, and visited often before that, as my grandparents lived here. Can confirm all. It was scary. Always wondered when I would find a body myself. One year before I started a job in South Miami in '89, my boss noticed a smell in the parking lot. He called the cops, and they found a body in a trunk of a car parked at the edge of the lot. (Lot of mechanics in the industrial park, nobody paid attention if a car sat for couple of days.)"

Sorry, I will ALWAYS try to stop. If it causes an accident, oh well. That means they were following me too close, and it's their fault. That's what insurance is for."
