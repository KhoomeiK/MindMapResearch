Tekken,ffa0s8b,t3_el8zqv,1579725575.0,"Law's f,F4,3 should be -12 on block or hit confirmable or have buffed combo damage. 'New season 3' move but it's one of the most useless moves in his arsenal. Apart from very specific combo situations, there is no use. Neither in neutral, since it's less damage is than 3+4, 4 launcher, nor in combos, since almost same damage as bnb tailspin b2,1 and with more recovery frames."
