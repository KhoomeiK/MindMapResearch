AskReddit,ffvpjix,t1_ffv7zff,1580269734.0,"""too much"" is subjective."
AskReddit,ffvp54o,t1_fftlxmp,1580269447.0,"Let me preface this by saying all lives are equally valuable at their base level. Kobe's life is no more valuable than someone who works Accounting in Utah in terms of the right to live. However, I really don't like that argument of ""why do you care about this person so much when it could've been this person and you wouldn't have cared at all?"". 

A public figure is more, well, public and therefore we can make a stronger connection to them. Whether it's their acting, their athletic ability, their intelligence, whatever, being in the public eye means people can know more about you than the average human being.

And some have a deeper connection than others. You said you'd be upset if your favorite singer died, someone who's also a fan, could be absolutely devastated because their music helped them through a rough patch or allowed them to cope. Both are equally valid reactions. Pretending like you cared about someone because they're famous and that can get you internet points or ""clout"" or whatever is one thing, but having someone you looked up to/admired for their abilities die unexpectedly can really gut some people."

AskReddit,ffudcsn,t3_ev3mrb,1580239587.0,"Classmate of mine committed suicide the day prior and we were all ordered to go to our study halls 1st hour (technically home room, it was just later in the day). Our study hall teachers told us and everything was just quiet......Like all day.

Maybe it was because it was my grade so I wasn't really exposed to the other grades' reactions but all but one teacher stopped lessons for the day (oddly enough that teacher was the one class I sat next to him in. Maybe the teacher thought the best way to cope was to just try keep moving forward with life? idk. Never liked her to begin with.) So we just kinda sat there and marinated in the silence.

Surrounding schools offered their counselors for students who wanted it but I personally never bothered, there wasn't really much for me to process that required a professional to help me with, but it was cool to see nevertheless. The next day it was back to normal, which I wasn't totally shocked by but that the same time I just thought ""really? That's it? Nobody outwardly cares anymore?"" Gotta move on at some point, I guess. The only time after that was he mentioned was at our graduation when we wore ribbons in remembrance."
