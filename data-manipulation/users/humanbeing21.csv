See someone in sports medicine, if it's important to you.  They could confirm your theory, and maybe suggest some work-arounds."
bodyweightfitness,ff5t6ir,t1_ff5hv5h,1579609311.0,It's hard to tell from the pictures.  The first one looks hyperextended but it could just be the camera angle and arm shape.  The others look borderline.  Why are you concerned about this?  Are you having elbow issues?
bodyweightfitness,ff5h3tc,t1_ff5fkzb,1579592597.0,"When you straighten your arms do they keep going beyond straight and bend backwards a bit? If so, they are hyper-extending."
bodyweightfitness,ff5gy93,t3_erqhry,1579592401.0,"I'm sick of going to the gym and have stopped working out for the last six months. What do you think about the following weekly routine that I can do while walking/hiking in the park? I want to improve (or at least maintain) health, strength, endurance but it's not a priority in my life. Am I missing any important muscle groups or doing anything to cause imbalance? Am I doing too little to make gains or at least maintain? Any suggestions for improving plan without increasing time?

\-----------------------------

Mon - sets of 20 pushups while hiking. Took 5 sets to fail on the first day. Once I fail, I just finish the hike without anymore calisthenics.

Tues - sets of 5 pull-ups at the park. Failed on fifth set. 2 minute rests

Wed - just do sets of 20 slow air squats and 20 lunge walks through out my hike. Don't worry about failure.

Thurs - repeat pushup day

Fri - repeat pullup day

Sat- repeat squat day

Sun - rest (walk only)

Everyday - walk/jog/hike as much or as a little as I want (or have time for), but do at least 15 minutes daily"
IAmA,ff43luy,t1_ff4295f,1579554800.0,I think it has gone away for some people.  It seems like it doesn't for the majority.  I've had my allergy for 5 years now.
IAmA,ff43f0u,t1_ff423os,1579554683.0,Thanks.  It would be awesome if the cure didn't involve taking a medication for life.  It's too bad that exposure therapy doesn't work for food allergies.
IAmA,ff383e0,t3_erek2q,1579535921.0,"I’m allergic to red meat and dairy because of an alpha gal allergy I received from a tick bite. I’m also allergic to gluten, soy and eggs in regards to my eosinophilic esophagitis. Is there any hope for curing any of these allergies?  Currently eating out is very difficult"
diet,felooex,t1_felnw10,1579227212.0,"Yes, the younger more unhealthy generations eat more meat and pork and processed foods. The healthier centenarians in the Blue Zones ate very little pork and lots of whole foods.  Less than 2% of their diet was pork.  Over 60% of their calories came from purple sweet potatoes.

diet,fell3aq,t3_epmywc,1579224757.0,"Lower fat wasn't the problem.  That can be healthy too.  See the Okinawan Blue Zone where the centenarians lived predominately on sweet potatoes with very little fat. The problem was super sized sodas, Gold Fish crackers, Pringles, McDonalds super sized fries, Dominos, Litte Ceasers, Entemans Fat Free Cookies, Froot Loops, skim-milk, Ice-Cream cookies, donuts, salads drowning in Thousand Island Dressing.  ...basically processed foods full of refined grains, sugars, vegetable oils, salt, preservatives, artificial flavors and other chemicals.

&#x200B;

You can be healthy on a lower-fat diet or a higher-fat diet.  Eat REAL WHOLE foods, not too much, mostly plants.

Another tip ...although sorting by ""New"" is great when looking to get Comment Karma,  sorting by ""Rising"" can sometimes be more effective in popular subreddits.  But sorting by ""New"" can be fun as you get to see things that may never make it to ""Rising"" and give them a nudge in the right direction"
