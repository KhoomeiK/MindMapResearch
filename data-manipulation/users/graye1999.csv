Aug2020bumpers,ffgeaer,t1_ffgd9x3,1579904307.0,Hey you’d be my favorite coworker if we were in the same office. Lol!
Aug2020bumpers,ffgdblg,t1_ffg6hib,1579903704.0,"It really does! I’m so glad you have that experience, too. It’s so reassuring to listen to! 

Much love!"
AskDocs,ffg6wpa,t3_etgbbs,1579899755.0,"I’m not a doctor but I have taken Zoloft for many years. I have never experienced a decline in cognitive function when I was on Zoloft some. 

However, other medications have caused this issue for me. Zoloft has always worked the best for me. 

Each person is different, though, so it may not be the same for you. I just wanted to share my experience."
Anxiety,ffg5t0r,t3_etgdqn,1579899075.0,Are there any stats about how pregnant women and their fetuses have fared with this strain?
Aug2020bumpers,fffqb8z,t3_etdbq1,1579889484.0,"I’m just waiting until someone notices, unless of course no one does. Then I’ll probably tell my boss around 20 weeks. Maybe the other girl who is pregnant. She’s about 4 weeks ahead of me. Then one other employee I’m friendly with and she will share it with everyone else. She’s that kind of person. Lol"
Aug2020bumpers,fffq46p,t3_etdgmu,1579889363.0,I’m worried. People at my job don’t stay home if they’re sick even though they can work from home. I’ve already caught a vital upper respiratory infection and strep. If someone gets coronavirus it will spread through here like the plague. Illinois is not that far from Missouri. Sigh.
AskDocs,fffm59m,t3_etchek,1579886933.0,"Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety symptoms. I did not do well on it at all. You should contact your doctor and explain what is happening ASAP. Don’t let it get any worse. 

Obligatory “I am not a doctor.”"
Cringetopia,fff9x9u,t1_ffdi0wm,1579879295.0,I remember the exact moment in the 4th grade when a girl called me anorexic for the first time. Even where I was standing in the classroom and what time of day it was. I’m in my late 30’s now. That stuff never leaves you.
tifu,ffe3xsx,t3_et3mh3,1579836059.0,A list of ways to make it up to them? They have their dog and it’s safe. There’s nothing to make up. If they didn’t want the dog to wander off they should have properly secured it.
Aug2020bumpers,ffe3ctn,t3_et4asm,1579835628.0,"Oh my gosh I know!!!!! I would kill to have Sudafed but you can’t in the first trimester according to my OB! 

I hope you feel better soon!"
Aug2020bumpers,ffe39js,t1_ffdxwuw,1579835560.0,I was exactly where you’re at when I went in at 8 weeks. You’re in a good place! You saw your baby and that’s a fantastic thing! We’re gonna make it this time!!! *hugs*
Aug2020bumpers,ffe0kge,t1_ffdtosj,1579833583.0,"Aw that’s so great! Isn’t technology great?! I shared mine with my hubby too because he couldn’t be there. 

So glad things are going well with you and yours!!!"
UnresolvedMysteries,ffdtifn,t1_ffdsprb,1579828544.0,"I’m so sorry that it took two years for you to get it sorted out. My meds were messed up for a year and it was the worst year of my life. I’m finally in a good place but it took about 3-4 months of normalcy to be in a good place. 

I’m glad you made it through!"
