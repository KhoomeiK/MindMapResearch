childfree,feagj4w,t1_fe78maj,1578948487.0,Ah but what's the real difference between the bar pub and restaurant? Owner could just say the bar is a restaurant  and then have kids allowed if they want right?

atheism,fe2k4s1,t1_fe20o50,1578839357.0,Quite frankly all their arguments are weak but still doesn't stop them from making them. I've literally heard the rebuttal to feeling air proves its existence that I wrote in the previous comment used on me. I even had my own rebuttal back and asked how come only religious people say they feel God? I feel the same as an atheist as I did when I was still religious. You know what their answer was? All humans feel God some just don't know what the feeling actually is. As you can imagine I gave up trying to have the discussion with them right then.
atheism,fe2hgeg,t1_fe1xgy9,1578838402.0,I'm so confused.  Observing heat waves is literally seeing with your eyes different densities of air mix together. Using a machine to analyze the chemical content of the air and reading the results isn't actually seeing air at all but seeing an intermediary object tell you air is there which isn't what the argument is about. The argument is that just because you can't observe something directly doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Using an intermediary object would actually probably work against you because then a theist would exercise some mental gymnastics and claim that reading the meter as proof of air is just like reading the Bible or seeing a beautiful landscape or their prayers actually coming true as proof of God. Even proving air exist by being able to feel it a theist could argue by saying they feel God everyday.  By proving that there's ways to physicality observe even transparent invisible stuff then the chance that an all powerful invisible being existing who is constantly meddling in our lives would still be physically observed somehow and yet there's been no proof ever. You could alternatively also see air by cooling it down to liquid state but that's much harder however even more visible.
atheism,fe1xe1i,t1_fe1c7ll,1578831966.0,"My response to the argument that everything is God's plan is that then it's his plan that children are beaten and abused everyday which, if God did exist, he's then the most evil being in existence and isn't worthy of any worship."
atheism,fe1we5c,t1_fe16tc8,1578831717.0,Or just have an isolated heat source and observe the heat waves which are just air of different densities.
atheism,fe1vzw3,t1_fe1t0d0,1578831559.0,But religious people arnt using the argument of not seeing air to prove it's nonexistence but to argue gods existence. Sure we can also feel air which also proves it existence but that's an easy one for a religious person to flip. They'll just say they can feel God. Plus sky is blue from tiny dust particles floating around in the atmosphere not the actual air itself but that's just me nitpicking.
atheism,fe1u6ay,t1_fe1sqzj,1578830884.0,"Yes we can feel it but that's not the argument. Plus I'd guarantee the response you'd get from saying  ""You can feel air so it's real"" would be ""well I can feel God"". And I'm pretty sure that the blue isn't the air itself but particles floating around."
atheism,fe1ss06,t3_enh9yz,1578830419.0,Well I do hate religion but doesn't mean i automatically hate the religious but in fact feel sorry for them. To me they're victims of religion. However that doesn't extend to religious people who begin to do awful things especially in the name of said religion.
Showerthoughts,fe1r3fj,t1_fe1izyy,1578829885.0,I feel this.  Only instead of bruised I had mine tattooed.....while I was employed as a roofer. FML it seemed every 10 mins I was getting a shingle brushed against it.

atheism,fe1dr9o,t1_fe16x7g,1578825416.0,Sorry to correct you but want to say you can see air and there's a very easy way to demonstrate it.  Turn on any stove top or light a lighter and observe the heat waves coming off it.  The heat waves you see are still just air but at a different density.
atheism,fe1caes,t3_enl9bp,1578824936.0,There's a very easy way to prove to someone that you can in fact see air.  Turn on a stove or other heat source and watch the heat waves come off it. The heat waves are just different densities of air yet when they mix we can see the differences.
todayilearned,fdwt60l,t1_fduw21x,1578762084.0,Civil discourse for the win lol.  Glad we were able to chat.  I appreciate your offer and I'll reciprocate it back to you as well. If you find yourself traveling or eventually relocating to Calgary area I'd be more than happy to show you around or just crush some brew together.

todayilearned,fduh5vi,t1_fdtg274,1578732913.0,"Hey man we both made minor errors which kinda snowballed.  I realize now that my original message, in addition to misinterpreting your message , also sounded kinda abrasive and stand-off ish. Plus then I  pretty much made the   same mistake again and misinterpreted your intensions behind the info dump. Honestly all things considered you didn't do anything wrong which would merit an apology from you.  I however should've taken the Extra time to make sure my message clearly conveyed what I was trying to say but in  a way that was less douchy. Fuck I basically ended up doing the exact thing to you that I called you out on in the first message lol.  I'm sorry I acted that way when you were only trying  to pass on knowledge.  I hope I didn't cause you too much grief and that you get to fulfill your dream of living here in this wonderful country I call home. There's so many different and beautiful places across the country . Hope you can accept my apology . Good night"
todayilearned,fdsshwg,t1_fdru2cz,1578707369.0,"Well Wikipedia does list English as  both the official and national language of the UK. However Wikipedia is far from always correct so it's possibly not true however I don't have the desire to research any more into it.  If you do end up finding a source with more merit that answers the question please lemme know.  Cheers



EDIT: Accidently stumbled upon the right answer somewhere else.  English is the de facto language of the UK  however the only de jure language in the entirety of the UK  is welsh and only within Wales itself. So I guess UK isn't technically an English country."
todayilearned,fdsq3lq,t1_fds1yc1,1578706482.0,"Sure original post was about population but you didn't say the population of the countries are usually small. You said the countries are usually small.  It was an honest misunderstanding but please don't treat me like I'm an idiot who  misunderstood your words when you clearly left out a word that would have properly reflected what your were trying to convey. I  understand most English-speaking countries have small populations and that the larger populated countries have many people learning English as a second language  resulting in the conclusion that there's a higher population of ESL speakers than native speakers. But why even bring this up as if I didn't already understand? You had already realized that I wasn't arguing the point you thought originally but merely interpreted you original statement differently than you intended. 



And I'm a proud Canadian who DOES care about how large we are geographically combined with our sparse population. It's really nice to be able take trips and dissappear into the wilderness to just relax and unplug away from everything and everybody. However I'm making this stament in jest.  I know what you meant when said  nobody cares how large Canada is geographically. Just figured that since there was already one kerfuffle of understanding why not double down and misconstrue another of your statements on purpose lol. Have a good night dude and take care."

Actually turned into our little inside joke. I agree that nobody should really nitpick people who communicate in a second language. She used to get embarrassed and apologize for her ""broken"" English.  I'd always say that even if her English was actually broken she still spoke English better than I could speak her native language, which to say I couldn't at all lol.

My English I'd say is above average compared to other native speakers but her English was at least on par or better than mine.  Her grammar and annunciation was excellent.  Only thing she'd get hung up on was she'd pluralise the first word of a two part noun.  Like shoes rack
todayilearned,fdqfnmd,t1_fdq2lnf,1578665463.0,Yeah tonal based languages are extremely difficult to learn for someone who's native language isn't a tonal based one.

todayilearned,fdqd7fe,t1_fdq4a1l,1578663540.0,"FYI the original post saying the Philippines being the 3rd most populated English speaking country is correct. The person you replied to misunderstood the statement and is using a list that ranks the number of English speakers present in each country. The original post is taking about the ranking of English-speaking countries, as in English being an official language, by their population size regardless of how many people in those countries actually speak English.  Therfore the top 4 most populated English speaking countries are India, Nigeria, Philippines, then the UK. And no I didn't make a mistake by forgetting USA. USA actually has no official language so therfore not technically an English-speaking country."
todayilearned,fdqcjar,t1_fdq3yya,1578662986.0,"You misunderstand what they said. The list you cited is a ranking of countries by the population English speakers in them. The other poster is saying that ranking English speaking countries, as in English being the official language,  by population size the Philippines is the 3rd most populated. Not the 3rd highest population of English speakers. Then it goes India, Nigeria, Philippines, and UK as the 4 most populated English speaking countries. You also may be thinking I made a mistake too cause USA should be second but since USA doesn't actually have an official language it's technically not an English speaking country by definition."
todayilearned,fdqb02v,t1_fdq248g,1578661641.0,"You mean the Kanji that the Japanese adopted from the Chinese in the first place? Hirigana and katakana are the ""alphabets"" that the Japanese created for their language but kanji are Chinese characters."
todayilearned,fdqak6d,t1_fdpxcwi,1578661235.0,I found that extremely unlikely when I  first read that statistic however then I remembered that USA technically isn't an English country due to having no official language.
todayilearned,fdqac8a,t1_fdprihe,1578661031.0,Now that is interesting. Is that by size or population? And does that statistic rely on the technicality that would exclude USA because it isn't an English speaking country due to the fact that they actually have no official language?
todayilearned,fdq7ofm,t1_fdq5wcz,1578658335.0,This is so true.  I'm Canadian and I had a Scottish roommate for a few years. Took a few months before we could just have regular natural conversation without constantly needing him to repeat or slow down his words. Well at least when he was sober.  Took over another year to understand drunk him.
todayilearned,fdq7dv9,t1_fdq38rv,1578658007.0,Yeah understanding Scottish English is a skill.  I'm Canadian but I had lived with a Scottish roommate for a few years.

movies,fdq4kzj,t1_fdoq4bt,1578654560.0,The differences in quality between the jack reacher movies is almost mind boggling to me.  I'm not really a fan of Tom cruise to begin with and casting him as jack reacher doesn't do the character justice at all so I passed on even watching the first one for quite a while. But somehow that movie hit all the right notes that made the novels great despite Tom and was much better than I ever could've expected it to be.  Then the second one was somehow much worse than I expected the original to be. How many times are we gonna get the corrupt military type  smuggling heroin in the caskets of fallen soldiers story?

The Uncle Sam character or the ""yes we can"" woman are both examples of propaganda. We just treat propaganda like it's something only the villains do and thus only connect the term with untrustworthy and deceptive sources.  All that being said, even though propaganda doesn't have to be deceitful or malicious, it's always designed to be manipulative in order to sway opinions to a certain goal."
