Henry is finally running to his potential this season (well really the last 4 games of last season too), and it could be big problem for the Chiefs. Mahomes will certainly do his thing but if Henry does what I think he will it’s going to be Tits/49ers SB.

Colts,fejwo4z,t3_epjrny,1579187565.0,"I don’t understand how he played the last two games. Nothing showed that he should have still been the starter especially once we were out of playoffs. 

After the Steelers game, he threw under 150 yards 3 times, (162 & 165 as well)  and the Colts went 2-5 from that point. The big win over the Panthers, he was nonexistent going 14-27 for 119 yards 0 TDs. Hell, even the big win over the Chiefs earlier in the season, 0 TDs 151 yards and the Jags win 148 yards 1 TD 1 INT. The run game did literally everything those wins. 

The run game helped tremendously but when it wasn’t working there was no other threat. I just understand the thought process of starting someone who has proven he couldn’t win games or push the ball downfield. I was never a big Hoyer fan so bringing him in was out of the question.

Colts,fd7gvpk,t3_ejpd7x,1578204308.0,"Prior to this season I was in full trust the binder mode. I fear saying anything on this sub negative about Ballard but even he questions himself.

It seems like every season we’re one piece away from getting over the hump. The Bob Sanders returns in time for playoffs thing. A few questionable decisions and comments over the last season or so:

Mike Mitchell- he played lights out last season and turned Wilson into a good player. Wilson regressed this year and I think his departure played a part. 

Al Woods/Hankins: I guess Hankins goes due to his price but our DL needed a huge guy like Woods to occupy space. I didn’t like him being let go and still don’t. I was not impressed with the DL’s ability to create pressure but against the run they were solid. 

Inman- TY gets banged up throughout the season and Doyle was injured last year as well. Inman was literally the only person not dropping balls last year and letting him walk seemed silly. The re-signing seems like the FO realized that but too late.

Rock- I think he was a reach. He looks slow, gets burned and then holds or commits dpi sometimes multiple times per game. He improved throughout the season but I’m not sold quite yet. Kind of looking like a duck. 

Campbell- wasted season but I’m hopeful.

Vinny- this one is troublesome bc it appeared to be almost shear stubbornness by the FO to keep him in.

Brissett- prior to injury he was impressive. Impressive really in a sense of surprise but not really from skillset. He was doing enough to win but not much more. Then the injury occurred. He proceeded to throw (I believe) under 150 yards the rest of the season and threw maybe 4 TDs in 9 games. In what world does a qb with those numbers stay in? Granted the next option was Hoyer but it was like the definition of insanity with Vinny and Brissett. Doing the same thing for 9 weeks and expecting a different result. I think we wasted the last two games by starting Brissett especially with Kelly in the 53 man. He was good enough to be a backup in Denver before he acted foolish and I think it would have been in our best interest to see what we have. 

Leonard/Walker- most of the time Darius is flying around the field punching balls out and making plays. But...sometimes, and it could be because he’s tired, he doesn’t seem to bring it every down. After hearing the remarks by Venturi I decided to watch previous highlights and Venturi of course exaggerated but wasn’t entirely false. Walker on the other hand does not have the same talent level but his leadership and football IQ saved the defense quite a bit. I think he deserves more recognition. Okereke looks good too. 

Kenny Moore- is Da Truf

Tell/Willis- liked what I saw, especially Willis. 

Hooker- not overly impressed. He missed some big tackles this year and seems to play more timidly since the surgery. 

Geathers- didn’t see enough good or bad to comment.

Desir- we’re better when he’s healthy. 

Turay- might have been our missing piece this season. This defense thrives on pressure but Sheard doesn’t quite have that speed rush and Houston couldn’t do it all. Hopeful for Banogu though. If Turay doesn’t go down I think we look a bit different. 

RBs- I honestly don’t know what to do with this group. Mack is great and his vision is improving, Wilkins was solid and seems to always fall forward (possibly goal line guy?), Hines May have been the most underutilized players on our team in the passing and return game. He is dangerous in space.

Oline- amazing. Going to really be a huge blow if AC doesn’t sign for 3 years and all of our cap space. 

Draft- QB, WR, TE, LT, DL, CB. Not necessarily in that order."
Colts,fd74ks5,t1_fd6cwj3,1578199351.0,"Everyone seems to play the rookie card for him. The PIs and holdings were from him having poor technique and being afraid to get burned, especially at the start of the season. It’s nice that he turned it around a bit but he’s certainly not the fastest guy and I didn’t see him go for the ball much if at all. 

I’m all for giving young players the benefit of a rookie season but repeat offenses are a sign of something and that’s what fans noticed. If you are slow(by comparison to WRs), have little ball skills and poor technique it’s going to get noticed. I sincerely hope Rock improves because we need him to. Great character guy but needs to stop making repeat mistakes. One game alone he had 4-5 dpi/holding plays. You’d think by like 3 he’d think  “okay maybe I shouldn’t grab this guy”."
Colts,fd5r2vs,t3_ejwm5c,1578180537.0,I’m a Frank Gore fan today.
Colts,fcvowic,t3_ej2byk,1578006794.0,Tom Brady with Hines and Doyle would be interesting. He doesn’t throw deep so TY would need to get his slot game going. But Tom throws a mean curl route (Jack) and 5 yard out (Hines). I’m not for it really bc FTP but I also don’t want Brissett as our starter next season.

Colts,fcntt8b,t1_fcntiwm,1577818279.0,I feel like people see a final score of a game and just assume if there are a lot of points it must be on the defense and not an offense that can’t push the ball downfield and win the field position battle.
Colts,fcnsl90,t3_ei6p1a,1577817621.0,"I think Special Teams bc of the penalties on so many FGs, PRs, and KRs. Also not mixing things up when Chester Rogers was averaging like 2 YPR while having Hines available warrants at least some punishment. Also, Vinny. I guess that could be a HC decision to keep playing him but Vinny missed an insane amount of kicks.

I think DC was put in a rough spot due to injuries and an inept offense. Desir was hurt a decent amount, Kenny Da Truf Moore’s injury was devastating, Hooker and Geathers were banged up off and on to the point where Odum and Willis were basically our starters. Turay was perhaps the biggest loss early in bc he looked great. Wilson was nonexistent except for the KC game. 

Also, take the last game as an example where Jacoby fumbles twice and one scored and the other gives them good field position. Those 14? Points aren’t on the defense imo, that’s the offense once again putting them in a shitty spot. Most games the defense was creating turnovers and keeping us in the game while the offense couldn’t do anything."

Colts,fclxzre,t1_fcl7izo,1577759228.0,I like that you called him MAC. That’s so much easier and I’m stealing it.
Colts,fclvgim,t3_ehtog4,1577757444.0,"I did see Darius make a tackle or two during the last game at about 5 yards further back than needed. He kinda wrestled the rb to the ground instead of stopping him from getting the first. But, he was probably winded from being all over the damn field every other play so who knows.


Going back and watching the highlights: https://youtu.be/Ivt20VY3W-c

1:15 - I think Darius is spying the qb and gets blocked pretty easily by a lineman. Not sure if he’s blitzing or spying and got caught flat footed. If blitzing, it was a poor effort.

2:13 - I think he gets caught in zone and couldn’t decide if the rb or wr needed covered so he got put in a rough spot. 

2:30 - again, I’m not sure if he’s blitzing or qb spying. 

2:44 - looks like he may have read run and got caught out of position 

4:00 - great coverage and play on the ball

4:50 - great coverage on TE but allows himself to get boxed out like a guy going for a rebound on the tackle

5:05 - either him or Geathers messed up BIG  time. Wide open rb leaked out and they’re both covering a LT 

5:46 - Brissett missing a wide open Inman and nearly takes a sack...just sayin

I didn’t hear the Venturi broadcast but maybe he saw more during film than I did in a little 7 min highlight reel. Like I said I noticed a couple yesterday that made me say “c’mon Darius hit him harder”...but oh well. Dude plays hard and he’s still growing I’m sure."

Colts,fc5mdq2,t3_eg4crt,1577461406.0,"I don’t get how we could go into next season with a qb that’s what..11-20 win/loss as a starter for us and not at least draft a qb. Jacoby was doing fine pre-injury and is better than Hoyer and that’s about as nice as I can be. He throws like 150 yards per game and averages 0-1 TDs passes. He might be our best option this year but I’d be very disappointed if he doesn’t have some competition next season. 

I’ll support Reich for making it work after losing Andrew and after Vinny fell apart...plus a million injuries to key players. I think it’s a credit to our oline and growing defense that we have 7 wins and solid depth thanks to Ballard."
