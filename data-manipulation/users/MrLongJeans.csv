educationalgifs,ff4y1bo,t1_ff4nzua,1579575185.0,"Well, in the interest of knowledge: consider also contemporary Western art philosophy.  

In our current science fiction world of iPhones, before considering art, consider beauty and truth.  'Beauty is truth, truth beauty' from [Ode to a Grecian Urn](https://poets.org/poem/ode-grecian-urn) published in 1819. 
 It is a topic of [debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode_on_a_Grecian_Urn#Critical_response) but in a nutshell: The Aesthetic, when it is comprised of pure beauty, is an eternal truth. People have extended this idea to [mathematical and scientific truth as beauty](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-beauty-truth-and-truth/). 

Keats' theme in *Ode* contrasted the temporary beauty of the human moment and the eternal beauty apart from our moment.  There is the actual truth of beauty that we feel, in *Ode* at its maximum in the embrace of young lovers. Separate, is the eternal lasting beauty-truth  apart from the human moment, retained in artifacts like the Grecian Urn depicting the full bloom of young love.  So kintsugi pottery, Grecian urns, math, science, love, sex, God, and other human art, is an imperfect language we use to approximate and convey truth as humans hold it in their emotions, ideas, and spiritual intuition. 

But art is not beauty or truth. 

As Picasso said 'Art is a lie that tells the truth' :[""We all know that Art is not truth. Art is a lie that makes us realize truth at least the truth that is given us to understand. The artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the truthfulness of his lies.”](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/10/29/lie-truth/). So for Picasso human-crafted art is not aesthetic at all., it could never be beautiful or true.  Instead, art's purpose is [not to be pretty](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/art/best-picasso-paintings-and-sculptures-ranked) but, through deceitful lies, to make you feel The Beauty and The Truth of the human experience... the full grandeur of which we humans may never know and exists only on the beautiful truth of the face of God.  And, y'know, [Picasso has a 162 ton piece of art on the sidewalk at the heart of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Picasso) that maybe a billion people have walked past since 1967, so his opinion might be relevant.

So like [kintusgi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi), where the artistry of the repair completes the beauty in broken things, in contemporary Western art the artistry of the lie completes the beauty of the human moment, an imperfect truth.

So to bring it all home to 2020 and the artistic era of Netflix, I cry when I watch [the final scene in Rainman](https://youtu.be/yPCM56-EnCM).  I assume there's a movie on Netflix that can make you cry and it's probably pretty dumb, right?  Rainman's not aesthetically beautiful like an Urn, poem, or painting. It's a totally made up story without a shred of truth.  But I have an abusive big brother who broke my arm (twice). Our love for each other is a thing neither of us can explain.  But it's beautiful and a truth that shapes the core of our identities.  In the Bible the first brother [Cain killed Abel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel).  So there is an eternal quality, a beauty-truth thing in violent misunderstanding between older and younger brothers. 

So to me, in this moment, Rainman is art.

Incidentally, in the entanglement of art, all the quotes and artists are from the last 200 years so I imagine this viewpoint I'm expressing will soon vanish from humanity.  200 years ago, someone in my position might have thought about Macbeth: [""This life ... is but a walking shadow; a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more: it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""](https://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=macbeth&Act=5&Scene=5&Scope=scene)

200 years from now, the player on the stage may be heard forever, their scene preserved in electronic media as well as the Grecian Urn."

bigdata,fewtfvp,t3_eqmq67,1579419225.0,"The big data field still has a few career siloes you should be asking which one you want to be in.  It matters because introvert/extrovert can make or break a data person.

You can engineer, manage, or analyze. Just like high school, it's nerds, jocks, and normies.  You can either be a SQL science nerd. Or you can be a alpha jock that other people follow around because they sound like they know what they're doing.  Or you can be a normie who uses Excel, is equally happy attending a football game or a science fair because they like watching jocks and nerds do things they can't do but wouldn't enjoy anyway.

Think really really hard about what you enjoy and if you can spend at least 30ish hours a week alone in front of a computer talking to no one."
bigdata,fewra99,t1_fevnynl,1579418317.0,"This sentiment is remarkably poignant.   I think 2020 will have an elastic effect on big data with data science stretching further away from Excel-based data analysis. Yet rather than break away as everyone was certain it would 5 years ago, Excel will crawl on and become more legion.

5 years ago everyone thought Excel was taking steps backward and being left behind by big data--totally true.  But Excel and Power BI have actually taken steps forward and handle big data better than ever.  This has allowed the rest of the world to crawl along after data science--we all thought Excel would be dead by now.  

But I say elastic, because the forefront of big data science will stretch further and further ahead.  The supremacy of data science compared to Excel-based data analysis will be all the more obvious and able to be monetized.  

But I think the data science-Excel bridge that has always existed will require more attention and energy."
worldnews,fetoclq,t3_eqgy8h,1579377570.0,"how does everyone get worse at taking trump to court each time they do it?

Like okay, day 1 of his presidency, he goes for a Muslim travel ban and they get a federal cease-and-desist injunction that totally BLOCKED the travel ban.

Similar efforts were a little more sloppy but changed immigration policy, kinda.

Then he's attacked with some robust civil cases that he's forced to settle out of court.

But then we're like, okay, rather than more court we'll appoint an old man Mueller to investigate where federal policy prevents actual prosecution and there's no hope of success FROM DAY 1.

Then they're like okay, rather than evidence-based investigation by the top investigative organization, the FBI, we're going to try to impeach him using the investigatory resources of unfunded House representative staff to start a process with no hope of passing the Senate on the charge of a vague, totally unprovable standard of 'high crimes and misdemeanors'.

Now somebody's like, okay, next let's try to get him on the fairy tale notion that international law is a thing, on a war crime that he yes ordered but was not directly involved in and is totally exempt from as a politician.  In the ICC, a court that the US doesn't recognize.

What's next, is Judge Judy going to preside over a UN General Assembly impeachment process with no hope of passing the UN Security Council???

That's what it's like trying to be with someone and instead of them being themselves, expressing themselves, so you can be with them, they refuse to be themselves and make the whole thing about you.  They focus on you, pleasing you, worrying about what you're thinking or judging them for.

Ain't nobody here trying to get jerked off, they're here to get someone else.  Like, the ENTIRE someone else including the secret, private, vulnerable bits, hopes, dreams, desires, that the other person hides from the world all day.

Have him pick you up, park far away from his house, and just walk like a mile holding each others hands and talking about the weather.

wholesomememes,fdlt7ge,t3_elue6y,1578531922.0,"Okay so I got a story about a Ukrainian woman who said 'my dear' in place of 'sugar' or sweetie'..

There was a shitty Pearle Vision eye center in a shitty neighborhood in Chicago.  It had an incredibly out-of-place store front that was north facing on a narrow street. So the front windows are always in shadow.  It was a diagonally running street so it had an odd-shaped triangular showroom that was dark, cramped, and had no inventory.  

It only had one eye doctor, who, was a unremarkable young lady who had immigrated from Ukraine. 

She wore glasses, a short white lab coat, and 

black leather boots, knee-high 

WHICH IS TOTALLY professional and Explainable because it snows in the Windy City. 

She used a softly spoken 'my dear' in place of 'sugar' or 'sweetie'' but seemingly unbeknownst to herself like the way other people nervously say 'uh' and 'uhm' unconsciously 

But it's like an Ukrainian accented 'my dear' right?

So my dear has these little Yup swinging vYowels,

""Please sit ^mYAi  ^dYEar..."" 

These uh, my dear, uhms were breathed out as a sigh due to the [tight-set 'frozen jaw' that is characteristic in some Eastern European accents](https://youtu.be/NvDvESEXcgE?t=142). 

anyway

So it was basically 30 minutes of:

 'okay, ^my ^dear,

tYake off tYour glasses' ...

'can you read 

^my ^dear,'

the bottom line, please, my dear.""

...and. like, without glasses you're kind of blind so you're hearing everything, the microscopic metallic clang that rings off the tiny lens rim swiveling in the eye measuring machine that she lowers onto my nose, the rustling of her white lab coat settling after the rumbling of her chairs' wheels as she moves about, and when she dims the lights, leans in close, nose-to-nose to look in your eye with that light scope hand tool thing 

you hear her sharp inhale before she whispers

...


^yO.K.ye 

^my ^dear, 

^look ^down ^. ^. ^.  

^^good...  

...

^nYow. 

^look ^up ^. ^. ^.  ^^be ^^still ^^now ^^my ^^dear  

^but ^okay ^to ^blink 

...

^look ^straight ^ahead ^at ^my ^ear,  


...

and there's that long beat where all you can see is the little mote of her skin illuminated by the tiny pool of light cast by that ophthalmoscope she's holding between your eyes.

Your whole world is pondering the infinite collisions of the colossal individual strands 

falling across your vision 

of dark hair backlit by glowing skin

like looking up at a blank white sky 

through the dark leafless branches of trees 

unrustled by the breath of air

entangled but not inter-woven

accidental interlocking chaos 

yet a function of deliberate design

...

^very ^good ^my ^dear...

^NYow. ^my ^dear

...
and you feel her reach into your hand 
and draw it up to your face

...

^please ^cover ^your ^right ^eye 

...

^and ^now

^my ^dear

^cover ^your ^left

And on and on like that, with you

my dear 

following every command of the uniformed authority figure

eventually takes them off 

when they're alone
