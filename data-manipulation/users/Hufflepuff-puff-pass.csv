migraine,fgs5mhz,t3_f04yss,1581072769.0,"Mine isn’t as severe but I definitely get aphasia to some degree with almost all of my migraines. One of my first warning signs is typing homonyms ‘hole’ when I mean ‘whole’ etc and then moves on to typing the wrong word but starts with the same letter. Then forgetting words all together, which follows over to speech too. It’s like I struggle to find my words, or if I find it to get it out is hard. Sometimes I end up with a work around like instead of ‘leash’ I’d say ‘dog walker’ or try to use hand signals to explain what I mean. It’s very frustrating and feel like I come across as an idiot when I have one."
SkincareAddiction,fgs4xwj,t1_fgru0y8,1581071807.0,"Yes! Sometimes I enjoy it when I’m high though, but I have to set timers or forget to actually do the next step and fall asleep without moisturizer lol

Happy Cake Day!’"
SkincareAddiction,fgs4vyv,t1_fgs0glx,1581071729.0,It’s definitely better than nothing! When I was still drinking I kept makeup removing wipes and my eye makeup remover plus cotton pads in my nightstand. Even if I fell into bed I can at least take off my eye makeup and some of my foundation etc.
SkincareAddiction,fgs4rul,t3_f05yki,1581071564.0,Ugh every day. I’m not crazy about skincare but I want my skin to be nice and stay nice so I’m here and had a basic routine that worked well for me. Discovered I have fungal acne this year so I’m currently redoing my entire routine and ugh so much work finding products that won’t feed the fungus.
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fgs4b6m,t1_fgr4rpm,1581070894.0,That is so cool! I love the colors you chose and it blends so well. Beautiful work.

I recently got my fungal acne worked out, just stopped using my moisturizer that was feeding it and am going through all of my makeup currently to get rid of what I can’t use (so much expensive makeup I can’t wear now *sob*). 

Washing my brushes is something I would have overlooked completely though! Doing that first thing tomorrow now."
WeWantPlates,fgljl4z,t1_fgjnqjb,1580901016.0,"Well suddenly my dad rarely cleaning his doesn’t seem so bad, at least he changes the water. Yuck. That sounds like a smell that sticks with you for life."
WeWantPlates,fgljjoi,t1_fgjjy0m,1580900964.0,That’s horrifying. I clean mine almost religiously because smoke through clean glass just tastes/smells so much better. Just the thought of that sludge makes me want to hurl. I don’t blame you for never wanting to try a bong again.
bleachshirts,fgliyie,t1_fgjnhq0,1580900148.0,Yeah not going to lie I thought it was the Sorting Hat at first.

UnresolvedMysteries,fgkzhhw,t1_fgioxjk,1580877495.0,"I hadn’t heard of this case before and wow! What a wild ride. I’m leaning toward it being a stalker but either way it’s amazing to me that evidence was never found that pointed to either her or someone else. Super sad no matter what. Thank you for linking to the other post about it, it was a fascinating read."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fgh7r33,t1_fggsvq0,1580778668.0,"YES WET BRUSH IS LIFE! My hair was all the way down to my butt a few years back and the Wet Brush is at least 50% of the reason I was able to grow and keep my hair that long and healthy. It helped a lot when I dyed my hair purple too and it was pretty damaged in the end. Really though they’re just amazing brushes. My bff’s daughter has SUPER fine curly hair and is a tender head, it was a game changer for her too."

badwomensanatomy,fggvxqo,t1_fggmbuv,1580770763.0,"“If I do a really terrible job no one will ever ask me to do it again” I swear my dad does this. I have a hard time believing he’s that incompetent unintentionally and the only alternative is that he half asses it on purpose so he doesn’t have to do it in the future. 

If he tries to clean up a mess, like a broken glass on the floor, he doesn’t do a good job (doesn’t sweep the grout on the floor, check under the edge of the cabinets etc) and me or my mom would have to go back and clean it up the right away. It’s easier to just do it right the first time ourselves."
PokemonLetsGo,fggugvv,t1_fgg3zve,1580769830.0,"This is almost exactly method I used for finding my shiny charmander. I did have the sound on too so if it spawned off screen I would hear the sound and walk down to check it. I stopped counting after 3k seen. I did get a shiny zubat, 2 ryhorns and a graveler while hunting, plus 2 zubats I didn’t bother to catch. I honestly wish my lapras hunting went as well as my charmander hunt did lol"

ehlersdanlos,fgf02q9,t3_extjxz,1580717320.0,"Cannabis, mindless tv or shows I’ve seen before (Golden girls, law and order), video games (if my hands will allow), reading (if I can focus enough). I love true crime so I watch the ID channel a lot and forensic shows when I can find them, plus podcasts and r/UnresolvedMysteries if I can handle reading. 


Sometimes I go online ‘shopping’ for fun.  I don’t buy anything but build a whole cart full of things with a theme or a goal in mind. Sometimes I research stuff that interests me at that moment. One night when my pain was too bad to sleep I researched Monster High dolls, the old ones with the good joints vs the new lower wuality ones. Which ones Iliked best, made a list, looked theough ebay and etsy, built a huge list and bought absolutely nothing. 

I have a lot of migraines and spend a lot of time in bed listening to tv shows with the volume turned down."

ehlersdanlos,fgeznjx,t1_fgd8w8a,1580716740.0,"I love true crime so I’ve spent a ridiculous amount of time on unresolved mysteries over the years. Great sub. I also watch the ID channel, lots of 20/20, 48 hours, dateline, forensic files, new detectives, cold case files etc. Plus most of them don’t strictly require me to look at the TV the whole time so  I can lay on my side or close my eyes without missing too much."
dysautonomia,fgezg2m,t3_exy6ji,1580716465.0,I often have to remind myself of this when I’m depressed at how wiped out I get just trying to do the bare minimum. I just don’t have enough spoons to get everything done that needs to be done. I would LOVE to just have 5 usable hours a day. Of course when I do have that much energy I overdo it and spend the next two days in bed...

HaircareScience,fgea1wh,t3_exw50h,1580694818.0,"A scarf or hat that you can tuck your hair under while cooking helps.

patientgamers,fg8o8dh,t3_ex6qyp,1580626324.0,Usually I agree. The only time I’ve bought DLCs is games that I’ve spent a ton of time in like Skyrim or Dragon Age where they have 100+ hours already invested and know I’ll enjoy it. Of course buying the ultimate edition is always the way to go if it’s an option.
SkincareAddiction,fg8nw1a,t1_fg7pcqh,1580625934.0,"That was my problem as well! I found instructions for stripping body oils out of sheets and used it on my comforter. Made a world of difference and now I do it about once a month. No more chin and jaw acne since then!

It’s also great for pillowcases esp if you use oils on your hair."

specializedtools,fg5o9bg,t1_fg56rdj,1580533130.0,We wrapped ours in a plastic bag. It was mostly used for cleaning up pulled nails from horse shoes rather than fine metal shavings so it worked ok for us.

I’m going to keep looking, this sounds like something I would have played at the time and now I need to find it.

Edit: also there are a few games made by Theresa Duncan like Smarty, Chop Suey, and Zero Zero that look promising. It’s hard to find anything about them but they sound weird enough to fit your requirements. If nothing else it was an interesting rabbit hole to fall down.
