A 900 series card at the time would be equivalent to a 980ti instead of a base 970 if you are talking about similar tiered cards when they launched and the 980ti had a MSRP of like ~$650 new. Extra $400 is still a price jump even considered the Ray-Tracing tech but don't try to think that a 970 can be compared for prices to a 2080ti since the 970 wasn't even the best Nvidia card at it's time (if you ignore Titans). Also really nice things can still cost a lot of moeny even with competition.

Yeah no, I only spent the time and money on [my rig](https://imgur.com/D7CbXL1) cause I have a smooth brain. My PC knowledge is a lot better than your business knowledge if you think a dev or publishing company could release a game 6 months earlier on PC for no real reason. If that were to happen those devs/publishers can say bye bye to any chance of locking in a exclusive contract for a game which is big for some teams.

A majority of all cops never go to any range in their free time so no real work use combined with extended periods of never pulling a trigger means that when they do the test their aim is dog shit. if a cop wants to carry a gun instead of being a meter maid without a gun they should do monthly shooting tests in order to qualify having a gun while on the job IMO. it's how cases like the UPS driving being killed happen cause few of them can aim and they thing quantity of rounds fired is better than the quality of their aim, kind of like the spray and pray kids in games where eventually you hit your marks even if it means you kill a bystander in the process."

battlestations,fddvu8g,t1_fddsbrc,1578325232.0,Good to hear. I might buy the block some time this week since I’ve been thinking of getting a new top and with the now stronger desk I can buy monitor arms without having to worry about sag after a few months or a year.
Bossfight,fddqn7c,t1_fddjfnm,1578321397.0,And no ones name in the op title is ever their real name.
pcgaming,fdd8arj,t1_fdd869h,1578299365.0,Only to some extent. I can run rdr 2 at max (no MSAA) at a healthy 80 FPS. I can easily change some settings to 144 and play like that but 80 is still fine for a game like rdr and the graphics are with the price. If those frames were for like apex or csgo then the frames are more important but those are the minority of most games I play.
Cringetopia,fdd2ba8,t1_fdcpagk,1578291952.0,that small porg craze from the 2nd star wars movie was so stupid.
battlestations,fdd28jj,t1_fdc9q5h,1578291867.0,Ikea KARLBY. Home Depot has an unfinished butcher block for the same price and size that is entirely wood. You are going to end up paying more since you are going to have to buy some kind of stain/finish but even then you are getting a block that is solid wood so sagging shouldn't be an issue which is sometimes an issue with the KARLBY due to the weaker material.
pcgaming,fdcx1kg,t1_fdcn1kx,1578286818.0,For most peoples rigs you either sacrifice graphics to make it run at over 144Hz to make the monitor useful but the game looks worse or you use the same old settings for the game to look good while never reaching over 144Hz unless you play a really low spec game.
