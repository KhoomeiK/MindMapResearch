InsightfulQuestions,ff30gbd,t3_erdd6f,1579530340.0,"Regret can be both a bad and good thing to hold. You want to let go of trivial regrets that just take up space like a post it on your mind. But regret about say a relationship ending is a fairly healthy response to losing someone: it means you valued them, and your bond wasn’t insubstantial. It’s up to each person to decide how to process regret, but as an emotion it can benefit from some examination so you know what purpose it can serve.

The key to processing emotions is specificity and awareness, to make sense of what your deeper and simpler brain is thinking. Take an incident by itself, lay out the facts of what happened, understand why people acted as they did, and appreciate what the consequences were.

Having some vague regret for something without unpacking what happened and what you dislike about that is a sure way to keep that untethered regret swimming around in your head. A typical psychotherapist will see how your well-being is impacted by an emotional event, and try to help you put the event into context so you understand it. 

The most extreme cases of trauma and abuse live as much in the unconscious mind as the conscious. Instead of recalling facts of events, an emotional impression is left and remains as a warning from the unconscious because the conscious mind hasn’t rationalised it.

Trauma therapists talk of helping a patient remember an experience without reliving it, without their adrenaline pumping and heart rate climbing. That’s the most extreme type of experience, but persistent emotions you feel towards the past are sort of along that line.

Once you have chewed something over, taking account for different perspectives which might mitigate your feelings toward it, then the regrets you keep are just a part of life. Try to learn lessons and move on to new experiences with greater wisdom than you had."

Longreads,ff2tyh2,t3_eqw7xj,1579524055.0,"> The role of “gatekeeping” institutions has also changed significantly. Before the internet and social media, most people got their news from a handful of newspapers and TV networks. These institutions functioned like referees, calling out lies, fact-checking claims, and so on. And they had the ability to control the flow of information and set the terms of the conversation.

> Today, gatekeepers still matter in terms of setting a baseline for political knowledge, but there’s much more competition for clicks and audiences, and that alters the incentives for what’s declared newsworthy in the first place. At the same time, traditional media outlets remain committed to a set of norms that are ill adapted to the modern environment. The preference for objectivity in political coverage, in particular, is a problem.

We've got to get away from this idea that the writers in the national press are somehow the most qualified and trustworthy to lead national conversations. That a few thousand words was published by a large organization is enough to have it accepted as a tenable position on any social media site, while a post by a user of that site will be picked over and their credentials examined skeptically.

> In this environment, there are often too many things happening at once; it’s a constant game of whack-a-mole for journalists. 

Only the most bare-faced lies get ""caught"" by journalists (now on Twitter more than anywhere) since they can be used as simple, accessible drivers of likes/shares, which allows the journalist to promote their own brand. The constant framing of issues in ""conservative"" or ""progressive"" mindsets doesn't get questioned, but instead accepted as part of the brand of their outlet.

ukpolitics,fdmwu4e,t1_fdmpxym,1578569434.0,"1\. Bilingualism affects the development and efficiency  of the brain's multifactorial 'executive control system'.

The bilingual brain is used to handling two languages at the same time. This develops skills for functions such as inhibition (a cognitive mechanism that discards irrelevant stimuli), switching attention, and working memory.

These skills make up the brain's executive control system, which looks after high-level thought, multi-tasking, and sustained attention. Because bilingual people are used to switching between their two languages, they are also better at switching between tasks, even if these tasks are nothing to do with language.

People who speak two languages have also been shown to have more efficient monitoring systems. A 2009 study  showed that monolinguals and bilinguals respond similarly when the brain's monitoring system is not taxed, but in conditions requiring high monitoring demands, bilinguals were faster. Bilingual people also outperform monolingual people in spatial working memory tasks.

2\. Bilingualism has widespread effects  on the functional and structural properties of various cortical and subcortical structures in the brain.

Our brains change and adapt as a result of experience. Studies have shown that people who are multilingual have higher density of grey matter , and that older people who are bilingual tend to have better-maintained white matter  in their brains.

So, does this make you smarter if you are bilingual? I’m afraid not. I don't know any study that shows a link between bilingualism and such concepts as executive intelligence, emotional intelligence or intelligence quotient.

3\. Bilingualism promotes cognitive reserve in elderly people

Taking part in stimulating physical or mental activity can help maintain cognitive function, and delay the onset of symptoms in people suffering from dementia. The onset of dementia symptoms is significantly delayed - by as much as five years  - in patients who are bilingual. The brains of bilingual patients with Alzheimer’s disease function cognitively at the same level  of monolingual patients who have suffered less brain degeneration.

Earlier than that the Swedes had invaded successfully, then the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and then the Swedes tried again but failed. Hardly a century goes by without troop columns heading one way or the other down that corridor."

wikipedia,fcuf6tr,t1_fcuby5n,1577979491.0,"> This is your grand excuse for socialism?

No, but there certainly are socialist aspects in most Western governments: public services, social security, nationalised industry. The reason I mention the military is that those contracts are paid by the state.

Workers and servicemen are housed, fed, trained, paid, pensioned, and cared for by the state. Some bases are like small towns, everything in them provided by the state. Tendering could be open to competition, but it's still tax dollars paying for everything: not exactly an enterprise of voluntary association.

> Your military must be a complete farce, if you think that.

I'm British, so I won't dismiss the possibility but I don't imagine ours is the worst in the world.

> Folks like you are dangerous. Using half hearted excuses and cherry picked news articles to push agendas you know nothing about.

That's presuming quite a lot, given how short my comments have been.

> America has probably provided your country with a military defense that has given your country peace since WW II

Indeed, and you're free to post articles about it too. It's interesting that you're still leaning on the role of the government though.

> You're living in an echo chamber in this sub.

Other articles I've posted include a piece by Andrew Carnegie on philanthropy, a biographer of Keynes, EU legislation, the Hanseatic League, and the Bank of England. If that suggests an echo chamber I wonder what it is."

jazzguitar,fcqd32u,t3_eihomr,1577883612.0,"Practice. It's worth remembering that ""expert"" literally means someone with experience, someone who has spent a lot of time on something. It isn't an innate gift that shows some players where all the notes are, they learned it by repetition and recontextualisation (repetition but in different ways, like drawing an object from different angles).

Before you start to play a tune, listen to recordings of it. Dance to it, learn the words. Get the song into you in the way that your favourite songs are, so you could sing it through by heart. Listen to how different artists have played it: recontextualise your understanding of the tune in the different moods and details that different people have brought to the same base material.

Then of course play the song over and over again. Play the chords and sing the melody. Play the melody and sing the root notes. Play at every position on the neck, play in every key. Play it through starting at open and finishing way up the neck, then do the reverse. Mimic the different ways you've heard the tune played: play what saxophones and voices have improvised.

This is what makes expertise: getting thoroughly into a song. Once you've done it with one tune until you can play it in your sleep, do it with another one. Get through a whole fake book in this way and you'll be listening to jazz with experienced ears, and you'll notice what different interpretations change. You'll start to imagine how you'd play it in your own way."
