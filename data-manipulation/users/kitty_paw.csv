You can start trying to skip the the potty break before she goes into the crate for 2 hours and see if she signals to go out. She should prefer not to mess in her crate, so you can push it a little."
puppy101,ffb8t98,t3_esnyzf,1579755380.0,"As much as you can, honestly. It's a rare opportunity to ensure your puppy has positive interactions with other dogs (assuming the trainer running the playtime knows what they're doing)

I went to Petco's playtime with my puppy right after I got him, at 8 weeks. Ours has it 3x a week and I've missed maybe 2 or 3. My pup is 5 months now. He looooves his playtime!"
dogs,ffb71nw,t1_ffb26cb,1579753525.0,"That's awesome to hear you've had a great experience, I can't wait for the class!

I hope you have fun at the camp!! It sounds so cool. It's only a couple hours drive away from me but I'm low on funds right now, maybe next year!"

They seemed like the most reputable option in the PNW (I live here too) when I was looking for a MAS. The only thing I don't like is that they have a NuVet ad on their site, but they don't really push it otherwise. Good breeders are really hard to find.

CC /u/cpersall for their thoughts"
dogs,felzq9x,t1_feld294,1579235194.0,"Just curious, when/how does fetch turn into a self rewarding behaviour, if that makes sense? My 5 month old MAS is getting the hang of returning things we throw but it's definitely for our benefit and he gets bored quickly. We'll keep trying but not sure if there's something we can do to make it more enjoyable for him.

Tagging /u/the_dog_queen too since they have similar experience."
dogs,fecz09r,t1_fe2mzny,1578990532.0,"So I bought one of these and I can feel that the material is nice and high quality but I'm confused on how it's different than a martingale. I see that the slip mechanism is different, but how is it better? Or is it just the material that makes it good?"
dogs,fe6sdul,t3_enx90b,1578903154.0,Absolutely stunning! I'm so happy for you!

dogs,fe5r7qr,t3_env1t8,1578873431.0,Try freezing them? I haven't done it myself but I think I've seen a comment where someone suggested this
dogs,fe37fmh,t3_enott0,1578846665.0,"It really does vary depending on the dog, so many guides don't, or can't, provide a timeline. Some dogs come out of the gate mostly crate trained and happy to go in their crate. Others have issues with seperation anxiety or similar and take months or years to properly crate train.

For reference, I started my puppy with crate training since we got him at 8 weeks. He cried for maybe 15 minutes at first and slowly less and less. The past couple weeks he hasn't cried at all when we put him in his crate for bedtime. He's 4.5 / 19 weeks old now."
dogs,fdpss2o,t1_fdpkni1,1578639064.0,I can commiserate. I have a 4.5 month puppy who hasn't had an accident for over a month but yesterday he peed inside twice. Back to taking him out every hour ðŸ˜“

dogs,fdougk6,t3_emhzcp,1578613141.0,There are so many breeds that are in between an English Bulldog and a Miniature American Shepherd. Do fill out the breed questionnaire that Automoderator posted and edit it on to your post! That'll be super helpful for people to suggest breeds
dogs,fdokzw6,t1_fdojzke,1578607265.0,"Count how many steps you can take before he breaks his stay. If it's 5 steps, you can go back 4 steps, return and reward. Then 2 steps, return and reward. Then 5 steps, return and reward.

You want to slowly increase the distance/duration but not make it harder and harder every time. Walk back 3, 6, 5, 8 steps instead of 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.

If he fails when you increase the criteria, then go back and make it easier."
dogs,fdcwh0f,t1_fdcnwv3,1578286326.0,Maybe I'm weird but I would love a sweater of my dog's fur! Gotta find a knitting friend...
dogs,fdc5lfx,t1_fdavg29,1578267554.0,"I wonder if you could do that with a Komondor. They look very sheep-like, lol."
dogs,fdc3ksy,t3_ekkp37,1578266425.0,It makes me so happy when I see my MAS running circles around other dogs and trying to herd them while playing. It's so cute. He tries to herd me too but I discourage it cause he gets nippy. He's only 4.5 months old.
dogs,fd87ttt,t1_fd8595f,1578214930.0,"Easier said than done, unfortunately :/"
dogs,fd76png,t3_ek6hxt,1578200142.0,"Depends what kind of harness you prefer and what features you want! Straps vs fabric harness for example. Straps provide more freedom of movement but may cause injuries if the dog pulls excessively. Padded harnesses are more comfortable for dogs that pull but can restrict more movement.

Other things to consider are harness shape, front/back clips, how adjustable it is, buckle on or slip on, back handle for picking up the dog easily, etc.

I spent a good amount of time researching harness options and I went with a Ruffwear Flagline for my padded option because it has both front and back clips and a carry handle. And for my strap harness I chose the Balance Harness since it's a Y shaped harness (better than H shaped because it's less restricting), has front and back clips, and ALL the straps are adjustable.

If you know what you're looking for in terms of features/material, I can help narrow down a few options for you. :)"
dogs,fd1d9bn,t3_ejudcr,1578130110.0,"Clicker training and using treats usually go hand-in-hand, it isn't one or the other. You use the click to mark when a dog has done something good, then follow it up with a positive reinforcer, such as treats, but can also be toys, access to something, praise, etc."
dogs,fcyz5i4,t3_ejm24t,1578090311.0,"Put the litter box somewhere the dog can't get to. Inside a large bin, behind a baby gate, on top of something. Or get a top entry litter box"
dogs,fcv9km1,t1_fcv815p,1577997490.0,"I agree with /u/cattledorks

I have two Petcos near me. I went to each of them for puppy playtime and to meet the trainer. The one closest to me has a really nice and knowledge trainer. She actually stopped working for a bit to get her degree in animal science before coming back to the same Petco to resume training. She's applying to become a vet too. She's fantastic. I signed up for a 3 class training package because I liked her so much.

The other Petco had a guy who I didn't really click with. During puppy playtime he laid down on the ground and encouraged puppies to climb on him and when they were being too rough he just clapped loudly in their faces. -.-

So yeah, definitely go check out the trainers, observe classes if you can."
dogs,fcpy646,t3_eig1b0,1577874688.0,"I think you're in a good place for this pup as long as you're ready to put in the work! I second the training class, look for a positive reinforcement ONLY trainer and puppy-specific classes.

If you're a fast reader, I recommend Patricia B. McConnell's The Puppy Primer book for the most in-depth information on how to raise a puppy. If you're slower or don't have much time, Sophia Yin's Puppy Primer is also a great book, just less detailed imo.

Kikopup and Zak George on YouTube will have specific videos for nearly any issue you might have (potty training, chewing, leash walking, etc).

/r/puppy101 also has a good Wiki that covers many aspects of puppy raising, including preparations before bringing the pup home.

You'll do great!"
dogs,fco6t5g,t1_fcn6sx7,1577825176.0,That's amazing! You've clearly put in so much effort with your pup and it shows. I hope to achieve many of the same things with my first dog as well and your story motivates me :) Hope your plans for 2020 all work out!
