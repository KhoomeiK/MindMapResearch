I cant. Why is this so funny???

I bet this wasnt the first time this Chris Hansen had to say that"
college,fffctyi,t3_etbp2j,1579881144.0,"I don't know you, so just reflect on what Im saying, please.

Usually, when somebody encounters the same problem again and again with different people, they themselves are the one who maybe should do something differently. Do you go on long tirades and don't really go as straight as possible to your question? Do you have trouble expressing your thoughts? 

Maybe, before going to the office hours, you could try writing down your question and have a friend or someone from class read it over and give you feedback on it - like if you're actually getting your point across, if you're getting straight to it, if it sounds like you're actually asking about something else"
college,ff7rxdk,t3_es39fc,1579656888.0,"Have you checked with a somewhat neutral person in that class, if they thought the same way about the situation? Maybe you're just taking it too personally? I don't know. 

If you still think you didn't behave in any way rudely or something towards your professor (and others agree), I'd just try to see how the situation develops for a couple more classes. Maybe you just read the situation wrong"
Onision,ff7cfry,t3_es10kt,1579646312.0,"Please take Notes
And please be as detailed as possible. The more direct quotes, the better.
Youre gonna be loved for this. Have fun"
college,fenh0qh,t1_fengyg0,1579284502.0,Well there you go. Take notes and highlight important parts
college,fengjh9,t3_eq3tcu,1579284208.0,"When you have to read, do you just read or do you mark the important parts, take notes, etc? If you're not doing that already, that's the first thing you need to do. If you're already doing it, make sure your notes are in your own words (rephrasing helps with remembering). Depending on the topics you can also take more visual notes like time lines or diagrams..."
Onision,femnoau,t1_femniil,1579263903.0,"Exaxctly! But at the same time they have to ask all the standard questions for this situation and act all professional

I wanna hear what those people were talking about in the break room. Or the what the cops were saying on their way to and from onion's house"
Onision,femkzq2,t1_femci7r,1579260778.0,"I didnt even realize that. But yeah, I think HansOn would be a way more intuitive way of spelling it. Now you made me imagine that the police was basically just waiting for Chris Hansen to show up, since they already were aware of Onision and obviously knew who Chris is..."
college,fem0mqn,t3_eps9ta,1579235949.0,My take away from your post is mostly that you need to take a good look at your work ethics... Why is handing assignments in late such a prevalent problem for you that it strongly affected your GPA in high school?
Onision,fek152o,t1_fek0iqc,1579190375.0,Thanks for sharing my thoughts. That makes me feel less crazy... But maybe we're both overthinking - or Greg is actually that easy to read
Onision,fejzvwp,t1_fejzd11,1579189603.0,"Haha true. Onion boy probably did google Chris already. 
And aren't we all afraid of those 60 y/o YouTube stalkers. Like that doesnt even sound like a real thing"
Onision,fejvtfm,t1_fejvda4,1579187010.0,"5'11 is like 1.76 I think and Onion himself is ""just"" 6' so like about 1.80m. 
Have you ever seen ""To Catch a Predator""? You can really tell he s a tall guy on that show.
Or do you know Conan O'Brien? He's a late night talk show host, who's very tall as well and Hansen is about the same height"
Onision,fejuuyn,t1_fejup07,1579186381.0,"Like 5'10"" or 5'11"" isn't exactly short, but if you've ever seen Chris Hansen standing next to other people, it's obvious he's tall"
Onision,fejup26,t1_feju8v5,1579186272.0,"Kinda, yeah... On the other hand I feel like the entire call is just kinda split-personality-like... On the one hand, Greg tries to make the situation look dangerous (""yelling through the door"", calling back, ""YouTube-Stalker""), but on the other hand, his ego can't even handle pretending to actually having to be afraid (the height-thing, being very calm in his answers, assuring at the end of the call that he'll be fine till the cops arrive). That's kinda where I'm at at my analysis of the call right now"
college,febdu05,t1_febd58d,1578957808.0,"Oh no, you were completely right to call me out on my phrasing. I just typed it out while waiting for my food in the microwave and didn't put much thought into the specific wording. I definitely sound like I m on a very high horse in that original post."
college,febcak3,t1_febaqne,1578957407.0,"Okay yeah sorry. I totally see your point. I sound hella condescending.
Your college experience in the sense of classes and what you learn and stuff is in no way something, that I feel bad for.

I just think the general circumstances are way harder for American students than what Im used to. Like when Im done with 5 years of university I will have given less than 3000€ in total to my university. Most American colleges - as far as Ive heard - charge more for one semester. I will have paid like maybe 300€ in total for books and thats only cuz Im doing a literature degree and have to read a ton of books. Otherwise Id be at like maybe 80€.

I don't wanna sound like your education is lacking whatsoever. It's just like... The whole system just makes the whole situation harder than it need be imho"
college,feb9nhk,t3_eo9ts2,1578956645.0,"""A friend of mine""
A friend... Yeah. Sure"
college,feb91fj,t3_eobuk0,1578956536.0,"Oh another thing I just remembered:
5. academic probation or whatever...
You get passing grades and you can still get kicked out of your college? What kinda fucked up system is that..."
college,feb8p34,t1_feb6six,1578956439.0,"I dont doubt one bit that many people love their college experience, but I definitely wouldn't wanna swap places with y'all"
college,fea32sa,t1_fe8t5e5,1578943853.0,That doesn't sound like the whole story
college,fe01qqb,t3_enfqs1,1578800908.0,"Not American, but German here.
I take History and English. Lengths of papers are measured in all kinds of different ways over here.
At my university, English is measured by number of words and History by pages (most professors give very specific expexctations like ""12-15 pages text, TNR pt12, double spaced, margins 2 cm left, top and bottom, and 3cm margin on the right"" - other professors are like ""yeah like not less than 12 pages including cover, table of contents and works cited, but no more than 15 pages text [basically making the requirement 9-15 pages] and do whatever seems normal for font, font size and margins"").   
Someone in a STEM subject once told me their paper's length was measured by characters. So basically very random"
college,fdm3mnv,t1_fdlemsu,1578539011.0,"If you are allowed to build everything around one question, OP, do so. And read up on the topic.
Basically with any good question you get 4 parts: introduction (for a 14page paper I'd aim for 1.5-2 pages), context (probably ~4 pages, what does the reader need to know before I begin answering the question), analysis (this is your main part: go for like 7 pages, working out the answer and giving it) and the conclusion (another page or 2, give the answer again, but shorter).

Your topic is: Capital punishment under Roman Law? Sooo what specific parts do you need to cover? Just from the top of my head: 1) forms of capital punishment, 2) reasons for capital punishment as in ""under which circumstances was one punished in this way"" a) social standing b) crimes committed c) differing forms of punishment due to different crimes? 3) changes throughout Roman history.
The Roman Empire lasted for several centuries, I'd expect the laws to have changed during that time.

I'm sure you can come up with even more aspects of capital punishment under Roman law. Especially if you start reading up on it. So get going and good luck"
college,fdm3e85,t1_fdljf2m,1578538856.0,"As a History student also not from the US Im used to working in a similar fashion as you, the only difference being: we have to come up with the question from the start. It really helps in structuring the paper"
college,fdhaf8q,t1_fdh8iw5,1578418839.0,That was exactly my thought
college,fdgr9sh,t1_fdgoohm,1578406266.0,"I wouldnt assume 85% for the tests.
Why would OP point out the 80% on the final paper which contributes less to the overall grade and not the higher grade on the test.
Id assume OPs tests grades are somewhere in the 70s (assuming 70-79.9 is a C and C is the last passing grade)"
college,fbgmiag,t1_fbgm3r5,1576853452.0,"You know, comparing grades is never a good idea in my opinion but it definitely doesn't serve any point, if you're comparing grades over m between two majorly different systems. You have probably as little idea what a 4.0 actually means in Germany as I do about what a C actually entails. For all we know, ""your"" C could be as difficult to achieve as our 1.0 or as easy as our 4.0. Therefore comparing this in a ""we have it so much harder""- way (which I interpreted from your comment, if that was wrong, I apologize) is pretty ridiculous."
