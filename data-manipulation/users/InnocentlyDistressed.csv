aww,fff6975,t3_et8myx,1579876774.0,My cat does this ... and then I start crying cause it’s too adorable to handle.
Showerthoughts,fff49tm,t3_et95vn,1579875308.0,Tbh that was never my experience but the shows where it’s a high school and people are constantly bullied did give me a lot of anxiety going in. Otherwise I mean yes they are played by older actors but young me saw no difference
dating_advice,ffdiop5,t1_ffd0gx7,1579821693.0,Can’t tell you the amount of times a guy hasn’t been my “type” but after getting close to them and liking their personality they because physically attractive to me as well. It definitely expands your horizons on what “beauty” is.

BipolarSOs,ff9wgdg,t3_esefam,1579723002.0,"I’d just like to say a diagnosis does not change anything. The man you married is the same man he has always been. Maybe with meds and stuff he will be more stable with anxiety or depression but if your husband hasn’t acted like your mother as a parent he’s not going to start just because he had a diagnosis label. 

Definitely take care of yourself and ensure your mental heath is good as well so you can support him but don’t project on to him just because your best friend has an illness.

You are well within your right to have boundary’s or express your fears to your husband so that you can both address it together. He can know where your head is at and what your boundaries might be. Again though he’s the same person you married he hasn’t changed as a person. Try not to catastrophis because sometimes what you project becomes reality with how you change the way you act around someone. 

I myself have freaked out multiple times reading other peoples story’s that are my nightmare, but you can’t predict the future and so far nothing has happened like that. Live in the moment, support where you can and know you can always get support here."
