Veterans,fffcz38,t1_fffcjpf,1579881232.0,"I was the same way. I don't want to hurt myself but I knew I wasn't healthy. Bad mental health isn't just thinking about doing physical harm. If you don't want to talk on the phone, they have an option to have a text conversation. I picked that option and it was a lot easier. Texted the VA crisis employee for a couple of hours. It's nice talking to someone who understands and can empathize with you. Don't hesitate to reach out to them and message me directly if you need any more help or just to vent or talk."
