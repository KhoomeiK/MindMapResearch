chat,ffgqa16,t3_etj5ls,1579912320.0,"Haters gonna hate. Some coach once said Michael Jordan would never be a good basketball player. It's someone else's skewed perspective. Anyone that would say that is trying to hurt you, they have probably been told that by someone else. What is the best teacher? Failure. From failure we learn. I'm not saying you're a failure but rather that person failed at being a good human being. Keep kicking ass and have a great night bro!"

unpopularopinion,fejc3v4,t3_epgxvg,1579166557.0, I think meme humor sort of presupposes a lack of intelligence so it follows that poor spelling is incorporated as the masses are genuinely clueless about correct spelling anyway. I do think that if cats could speak they would call us hoomans just because they are assholes that know we love them.
literature,fejbtjv,t1_fejb9ub,1579166125.0,Crime and Punishment. It has this kinda absurdist vibe that the protagonist is a victim of his own fate. I haven't read The Brothers Karamazov but I've heard good things. You might like The Trial by Kafka.

mentalillness,fed8pc2,t3_eokdoe,1579003852.0,"I used to get really angry when I was younger I think a lot of it was there's so much testosterone in your body at that age. I know a lot of psychologists think that anger is a secondary emotion caused by something other than itself. It seems a bit concerning that you can't seem to control it. Perhaps there's something deep within your subconscious that you are angry at yourself for not stopping or changing. I don't know what the solution is but I think you're on the right track just asking the question. Also, a lot of mood disorders are diagnosed at this age, I'm bipolar. You'll sort it out."
