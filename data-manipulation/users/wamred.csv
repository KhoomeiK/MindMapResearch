duckduckgo,ffan5z0,t3_esk48x,1579739874.0,"Personally, I don't use Chrome, I prefer a Chromium based Brave Web Browser. It is pretty much de-Googled Chrome. It also has a built in ad blocker that actually works really well. I also like that it is Chromium based because it allows me to use the Google ad ons for Chrome without having to worry about Google spying on me. To answer the second question, I am not sure, I would think that if you have a blocker already installed in your browser then I would think it would be enough, but I am far from an expert."
