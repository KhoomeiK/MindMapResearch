apexlegends,fglc36x,t1_fgk2wbb,1580890226.0,Honestly think they should buff havoc to give it a built in turbo. Its good but not broken with turbo so why not. If not that then like 60% of turbo
RocketLeague,fglbdqh,t1_fgl66lu,1580889309.0,Without breaking ToS yes. But i refuse to give them more money lol

apexlegends,fgjis9p,t1_fgjihbx,1580844912.0,But also anyone with a digi threat can just see through the smoke lol. Caustic can gas in it. etc. People got used to the smoke so its not that bad now
apexlegends,fgji8zs,t1_fgjg009,1580844596.0,Exactly. Octane can get anywhere faster than them lol. Octane is not useless in the slightest. Tbh bangalores prob worse
apexlegends,fgjeoo6,t1_fgjeiw7,1580842466.0,none of them are faster. he literally has infinite movement speed buff
apexlegends,fgjejqd,t1_fgjaj7q,1580842385.0,they should have given havoc the same treatment as devotion. built in turbo
apexlegends,fgjeh8o,t1_fgjb4ap,1580842344.0,well..not really lol. 1 damage buff isnt that drastic. shit it was good before

apexlegends,fghamnb,t1_fggcfux,1580780548.0,Its because people want to overexaggerate
apexlegends,fghalm1,t3_eybmg3,1580780529.0,Its not that bad.. Everyone wants to  overexaggerate but it really isnt that bad
apexlegends,fgh94ae,t1_fggfbek,1580779566.0,The skin in the pic is based on Baphomet. So its not even a Guillermo theme
apexlegends,fggd64s,t1_fgg3f0w,1580759378.0,Watsons legendaries are better than her default tho
apexlegends,fggczwc,t1_fgg35e0,1580759273.0,Coulda just said Pans Labyrinth :p
apexlegends,fggcfqi,t1_fgg3jb4,1580758931.0,All of them are great to me except caustic. but holy shit that revanant one is the best one in the game hands down
RocketLeague,fggbojs,t1_fgfsns6,1580758465.0,Nah i know its just i keep seeing lower ranks get better mechanically and it makes me feel worse lmao
