politics,ffpj10o,t1_ffpifdb,1580096204.0,Defending Trump now would show them as the Hypocrites they are. At the same time they fear what effect Bernie Sanders will have on the pockets of their investors/shareholders/bosses. So keeping quiet is the best they can do to the danger Sanders poses to them.

politics,ffegibc,t1_ffd8fvl,1579847109.0,"When I finally decided to go back to school at 29 yrs old with a wife and 3 kids, I managed to get straight A's my first semester back while working full time. The amount of effort though. . . I was feeling a burn out already and nearly quit before I had even started. Then out of nowhere, I was finally up for my turn for the Section 8 housing assistance I applied for 11 years prior. Wasn't expecting it, totally forgot about it altogether. 


It was a godsend! I managed to work part time and spent the next 4 years in CC until I got all my pre-reqs done. I got accepted into my first choice University, but due to the increased strictness of the agency resulting from lawmakers diverting funds away, tough deadlines, and a shitty landlord who terminated my tenancy at the worst time out of retaliation. We ended up losing the benefit. 


But I stayed the path, and sent my wife and kids to live with my in-laws and spent  the next 2 years living with the cheapest accommodation I could find. Then lived in my car the final year, 4-5 days a week, in the next county over. I'm a full fledged Engineer now. Now, C's get degrees I guess. Nevertheless, without that government assistance early on, I would have abandoned this road a long time ago."
