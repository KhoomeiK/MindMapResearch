aww,fdu0d88,t1_evxkjlq,1578725267.0,"By a very very small amount. Statistics, the “hard evidence”, say that 32 people a year die to pits. To put that into perspective, you’re more likely to be killed by lightning."
aww,fdu07wk,t1_evwwumr,1578725183.0,"Statistics? 65 percent of dog related deaths are pits. 50 deaths a year, 65 percent... 

32 people.

aww,fdtsg2a,t1_fc1d0la,1578721484.0,"65 percent of dog related death.....


(50 people dead per year, 65 percent of that is 32. Stop trying to make it sound like these dogs are mowing down cities.)"

aww,fdtoaw3,t1_fdto0nl,1578719675.0,"And,

Typically, between 30 and 50 people in the US die from dog bites each year.

AskReddit,fcyfkyb,t3_ejdlbw,1578079362.0,"My ex girlfriend. She broke up with me unexpectedly and then pretended like it was all my fault, when she wouldn’t even give me a straight answer on why she did it. Fast forward a few weeks and she tells my friends I “took out my dick and wouldn’t put it away” in front of her, basically amounting to sexual harassment when I did nothing of the sort. She then has the audacity to tell me that most of my friends can’t stand me when she knows I’m very insecure about that stuff. So yeah, she became an asshole for no real reason."
