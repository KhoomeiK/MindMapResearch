But seriously i was wondering why aren't there more people fighting shit like this? Like IMPORTANT shit? Why has American let us die due to stupudly preventable things? Why, as the youngest sibling of the world's,  not learned from other countries mistakes And seen that ""hey this works for that well developed country,  we should at least try it out""? Or at least thought ""hey maybe these laws that were made at a time technology wasn't exactly evolved need to be updated?""  Canada has really cheap insulin.  Austrailia has strict gun laws. ... i forgot which country,  but there's that country/ company that their car seatbelts are made in that x shape bc that's just safer than the regular \ seatbelt, and American result said ""hmmmmm... fuck that actually.""

So many times i fucking wonder why America is insisting on being the rebellious, gothic lyoungest teenage brother that everyone thinks is weird Sens dangerous, but everyone's too afraid to say anything to. A softer example: WHY DON'T WE USE THE METRIC SYSTEM LIKE EVERYONE ELSE??? WHY DO WE HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT??? honestly half the country souls annexx itsself from the United states, so conservatives can have their weird standard measurements, guns, god and constant death (and eventually, they'd really just die off at this rate), and everyone else, even slightly less conservative can live happy lives,  not judging others,  not constantly dying bc we are too stuck our ways and how ""its always been"" to notice when something isnt working. Bc i would move to that new country in a heartbeat.

That said im a black woman currently living in texas. I wanna smoke pot and date boys without them saying ""i date really date black girls"" and i also don't want to be racially harrassed/killed. I desperately need to get out of texas, and Those are all my requirements.  Where should i move?"

I didnt ask you to apologize, it makes sense for everyone to be defensive in this social climate. 

But look howbyou feel about this man witch hunt, is how women are feeling about men and theres this huge gender war going on. Everyone is lumping the whole other sex in with all the bad apples and its getting harder and harder to tell who the bad apples are.

Instead of focusing on blaming a whole group, i try to focus on me and the people i surround myself with and my surroundings. I try to condemn just the bad apples tho. However you cant say girls are the problem, we're scared! I dont blame all men but in a room of strangers, we need to be on gaurd and protect ourselves, not just women, men too. Both women's and men in your situation's common enemy is the bad apples! Blame them for your reclusiveness, blame them for womens fear!

Anyways, someone said they stopped giving a fuck about people being creeped out by him... im a female, so you may not want to take my advice but i do see that as... sort of problematic, for lack of a better word. 

Just because that's essentially not caring about the vibe you give off to other people and not caring if youre making the women around you uncomfortable. Not a great way to make friends. Something about that makes me feel... just off you know? So i wouldny say that. In fact, i would advise the opposite. 

Like the problem is that youre a lone man and some women/people are programmed to think lone man equals predator. I think thats a fair... assumption. But you know what they say about assumptions. Personally, when someones giving me a vibe, it can be chalked up to thier tiny subly mannerisms and word choice and how they present themselves.  Most people are more likely to befriend someone if they have a warm, welcoming aura about them. 

I could be wrong bc im no expert, but in my opinion, thats the best advice you can give someone: to be welcoming. And when you suspect someones assuming youre a creep, maybe speak to someone else, and smiling at other people?"

People can lose themsleves in weed and it becomes their whole personality, much like alcoholics. But no one says ""alcohol is for closers."" (Well... Like seriously). Idk i just dont think i get why theres such a big stigma for weed but no one is concerned about what alcohol does to our bodues or our societies.
