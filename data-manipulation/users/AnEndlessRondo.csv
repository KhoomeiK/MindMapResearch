There's a time and place for fetish shit, and I'm not interested in this this uncanny bullshit when I'm trying to read the news.

And for Paul Marketing whose patting himself on the back thinking ""At least I got your attention!"", I'll sooner quit Reddit than put up with this bullshit again."

People also seemed to be a lot tougher back then, the shit you hear people surviving through is astounding.

Anyway, all hail Queen Shit of Liesville."

If you took all of the stereotypes that people invented about black people and put them together, I can only imagine what kind of creature would give form."
politics,ff47w91,t3_erd4ap,1579557468.0,"Well, of course.

If you know the history of America, you'll know that there hasn't been one, not a one, black movement/trend/experience/interest that didn't warrant an immediate kneejerk reaction to about how dangerous and/or awful it is, and people leap to stop it before it's slowly accepted/tolerated

Blacks invent some sort of new kind of music?? The first thing is that people say is that it's trash (Rock, Jazz, Rap)

Black people are voting? We cannot have that. (KKK's several revivals)

Black people are being accepted here? Not on our watch! (American soldiers expecting blacks to be segregated overseas in other countries during wartime)

Black movement? Evil devils out to destroy America, they don't know their place! (Black Panthers, Civil Rights Movement, Blacks gaining power during Reconstruction)

\#blacklivesmatter? No! #ALLLIVESMATTER! #BLUELIVESMATTER!

Black Panthers excising gun rights? Time for Gun Control!

And of course, welfare. Welfare wasn't always the demonized tool of the lazy negro, and people readily accepted it. Once newspapers started putting pictures of black people in articles about it, then it became the issue of the LAZY NEGRO living off YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.

I mean, shit. Black people got excited about the Black Panther movie, and then suddenly everyone starts trotting out 20+ year old movies and how black people should be happy that they got shit like Steel. Meteor Man certainly became a lot more popular during that time."

A lot of black history IN America can be summed up as the following

""The blacks are trying to/are going to gain some sort of advantage, like the rest of us!""

""*What!?* **NO!** Stop them! Break it down! Take it away! Block it! Destroy it! Kill them! Just make sure they don't get their hands on it!""

For example, when swimming pools were ordered to be desegregated, many towns, particularly in the South opted to tear the pools down than have to share that space with black people."

A lot of black history has America ripping off it's face to spite the nose,"
politics,fdmds6r,t3_em268v,1578546638.0,"Well, considering the history of this country and this state in particular, it doesn't surprise me at all that people think that the end times are near when black people start gaining resources/power/influence.

I kind of wish that black people had even a quarter of the evil superpowers that people think they have, then at least the fear of them would make a little sense."
