television,ffhm3ww,t1_ffhh5gd,1579941804.0,That’s because it started as a procedural and once you got to know the characters they dive right into the fantastic character development.

todayilearned,ffgqdwj,t1_ffgpq35,1579912399.0,"Minnesota is the land of 10,000 lakes but we actually have somewhere over 11,000 natural lakes. We also have probably  ballpark of 1,000 man made lakes. Wisconsin likes to say they have more witch if you look at the numbers they do but what they won’t tell you is they have a much more ambitious definition of a lake so they include ponds and probably puddles haha. But yeah we have a wealth of water."

nevertellmetheodds,ff99ibw,t1_ff8zhsw,1579707932.0,"I could be wrong but I think it’s a metaphor for fighting a war against insurgents. You take out one insurgent then their brothers, uncles, community, fellow villagers, and so on get involved and take up arms against the people who  are occupying their land and killed their brother, son, friend, nephew what have you. Insurgency isn’t war in the traditional sense, there’s no standing army it’s a war against the people. If they weren’t radicalized to start with killing their kin and occupying their land will make it much easier to radicalize them. 

A good example of this is red dawn where America is taken over and those kids fight back."
AnimalsBeingBros,ff70cxg,t1_ff6cok6,1579638589.0,"I don’t know how much I agree with your sentiment but yes it can be cruel.We have a camera set up to watch our pups. We have a crate for remy and have her go in it before we leave for work, school and whatnot. We actually took the door to it off and keep it in the closet for when we need to travel. The thing is remy loves her crate it’s her own little den. She only comes out of the crate when she needs water or to stretch her legs. She pretty much hangs out in her den all day but when everyone is home she never goes in it because shed rather hang with us."

oddlysatisfying,ff3w9g0,t1_ff3tvm7,1579550227.0,No I don’t think so. It was clay from her creek and I don’t even know the show it was on it might not have been about addiction because like I think they said the particular clay she was eating was actually safe and potentially beneficial. I just have a stagnant lake water taste in my mouth right now.
interestingasfuck,ff3ucu3,t1_ff3shxs,1579549039.0,If you don’t need a lot of fire wood it’s a great exercise to just go out for an hour and chop wood everyday but it’s not as convenient for sure. It’s nice my dad has a friend who lets us use his and when you get in the routine it’s kinda fun. But wow does it scare me when I’m the one stacking the wood on it and the person pulling the lever gets a little ahead of them selves.

interestingasfuck,ff3lj7m,t1_ff31fxs,1579543612.0,"As other people pointed out that’s not the function of the axe but also why wouldn’t it see wood? It’s an axe. Unless he just uses it as a mantle piece, but a man with a power planer like that must do a lot of wood working. And Id bet that he also is in the business of harvesting the wood himself. Could be hes restoring it to sell. There’s a big market in restoring and tools since a lot of things are not made with the same build quality as they used to be."
oddlysatisfying,ff3k8yy,t1_ff3io7i,1579542829.0,Newborns are very susceptible to botulism that’s why they can’t eat honey. Also unrelated but does anyone remember that episode of the strange addictions or whatever where that woman ate clay from a creek by her house?

videos,feegitb,t1_fdnjha7,1579033289.0,"Funk to the max. I don’t regularly listen to funk but I have all the appreciation and respect. 

This band I’m about to mention has had some attention through reddit so if you know them pay no mind but either way you will [groove](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yG96RttfZtM). 

The band is [Vulfpeck](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulfpeck). I’m not a regular listener by any means but that song I linked is fantastic but my favorite has to be
 [wait for the moment ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r4G0nbpLySI). 

I learned from a TIL post that they put an album on Spotify that didn’t have any music. They had people play it when they went to bed or when they weren’t listening to anything. They used the revenue from that empty album to fund a  free concert. Such an interesting and unique thing to do.  

Ooo before I forget here’s one more song you may appreciate as it’s definitely funky [bad bad news, Leon bridges.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cztfyj1dVgk). all day all night, alright? Alright."

AskReddit,fe04hbv,t1_fdzzza3,1578802848.0,"You can have that too you just gotta practice. I get them all the time. It sounds dumb, you are probably thinking “trust me buddy I practice every night.” But just because you jack off doesn’t mean it’s practice. It’s like how driving to work every day doesn’t make you a speed racer, that shit takes practice not passively doing it. 

What I mean is listen to your body, feel yourself and take it slow. Tease yourself and Take it painfully slow until you just can’t help yourself. Vocalize what you feel, get primal. 

If you want to take a deep dive into achieving the best organisms you can buy my book. The organ of passion 2 electric boogaloo. 

No but seriously you can have those mind blowing, spasm inducing earth shattering O’s if you work at it. Try sometime jacking off without porn and make it only about yourself. Eventually once you can give yourself those amazing feelings you’ll be more likely to experience them during sex.

specializedtools,fdeehr4,t1_fde7xab,1578337268.0,"It’s strange at first glance but some of the reasons you pay for volume is probably so people don’t sell green non dried wood. I’d imagine when people sell firewood in bulk they sell whatever kind of tree it is because dense “hard” woods like oak burn much longer while light “soft birch or most maple burn hot and quick since it takes less energy to burn. 

If I recall correctly the term short stack or short stacked comes from stacking wood in a way where it looks like more than it is. You’d be surprised how condensed you can stack from a full pickup bed of loose wood.

Anyways yeah if you pay by weight they could sell you uncured wood and make money off the water weight. Plus rotten wood is usually heavier. All this is trivial as you can just look at the wood to see if it’s dry but if it rained you couldn’t tell or if you buy a lot you can’t look at all the wood underneath and stuff. I’ve never bought or sold wood unless it was at a state park so idk what I’m talking about. I’ve just split a bunch for my dad haha."

NatureIsFuckingLit,fckwgjr,t1_fckq1dh,1577734675.0,I wonder if they figured out how they moved it. Did they see any tracks in the surrounding areas marks on the rock from heavy equipment? I’d imagine you could lift it with some straps and an extending fork lift into a trailer or possibly a heavy duty pickup truck.

Honesty I really wish I didn’t have such low self esteem right right now because it can make me think irrationally and not behave like a good friend if that makes sense. But I’m happy now. I  hope I can think less about these things in the future.
