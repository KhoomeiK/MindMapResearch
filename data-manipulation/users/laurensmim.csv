OurPresident,ffvfa1q,t1_ffsaiof,1580262755.0,"Ok, I spent 20 years in addiction, I went into recovery 4 years ago. Once I got out of treatment I was able to find subsidised housing. My husband, now ex husband, got out of treatment and found employment. Ordinarily in our area that would have been enough to find non-sunsidised housing. After 3 weeks of working we receive notice that child support was going to garnish 60% of his income. He has no trouble taking care of his kids, after he got his first paycheck the first thing he did was call and ask what they needed and when he got it I made the trip to the post office to mail it. 

Here is how to keep someone poor:
The housing worker we reported our income change to told us it doesn't matter what is garnished, they calculate our income and 30% of it is what we owe AFTER taxes but BEFORE the 60% is taken out. So now we have 30% going to housing and 60% going to child support. We now get to keep 10% of his income. You would think we would ve eligible for food stamps, nope. They do not count what goes to child support either. We get Medicaid but no food stamps. I have cancer, we can't do without Medicaid. At that same visit we were told that it didn't matter whether I'm abke to work or not because if I get a job or he gets a second jib it would put our household OVER the limit to get Medicaid. Up until now we have been living the recovery life but this made us want to sell drugs, we would get food stamps, Medicaid,  and lower rent because we would have 'no income' and he could do better for his kids than the 60% income they take from him. If we work we get 10% of the income and starve. Yes, he quit his job, no we didn't sell drugs. 

In our state, if you have a really low income, lower than my 783$ a month because I dint even qualify for the complete $193 a month in food stamps they give a single person with no income. Apparently even paying 153$ a month from my check I still make enough monthly to only get $53 a month in food stamps. They believe I can survive on $783 monthly, pay my bills, and buy food, except for $53 worth of food. Even when I was with my husband, if he took a second job, or if I had gotten a job, we still would have been below the poverty level, at 8$ an hour, it's hard to rise above the poverty level. If you make an amount of money that is almost enough to live on your own in this state, West Virginia, they will give you Medicaid but say it's too much to get help with food; food you can't afford no matter what their formula of determining eligibility says. So many here have health problems that state funded Medicaid is almost a nessacary thing. If you get a second job or really increase your hours then you will make too much to qualify for Medicaid. It's insane what kind of poverty cycle they keep you in. It is very lucrative here to sell drugs. You can survive better if you don't work."
OurPresident,ffuj8lt,t1_ffss141,1580243113.0,"My immediate need right now is having cancer coming back over and over to the point I was approved for disability, which is $783 a month. It's not a lack of motivation, before all this happened I had been in school trying to get a nursing degree. It would have let me make enough to save money to move somewhere else to have a decent life"
OurPresident,ffuj1g2,t1_ffsaiof,1580242991.0,"U am more than happy to sit down and break it down for you. My immediate situation is having cancer that's recurrent so I'm on disability. There is a cycle of not a cyclone that will suck you down into poverty that I want to break down for you, just at a later time this evening. I just wanted to break down the immediate situation."

OurPresident,ffruk8l,t1_ffr83he,1580166153.0,"I love on $783 a month. I live in subsidised housing which is $153 monthly. I pay electric, Wi-Fi (only $10 a month for low income people), Hulu and Netflix, and my phone bill. I get $183 a month in food stamps which if used right can feed you all month. It's not easy to live like this, esp with a daughter who just turned 18, but it is doable. I think anyone who wants to cut social security and/or disability needs to come live 30 days with me, or anyone else willing to ""foster the politician"" so they can see how we already just scrape by. I'm going to let my daughter stay with me rent and Bill free so she can go to the University here and get a degree. Scraping by for 2-4 years doesn't sound bad when you realise it will get you out of the poverty cycle here in Appalachia."
Wellthatsucks,ffrtd01,t1_ffrmn0t,1580165392.0,Some women shave their arms here and there so they aren't super hairy all the time. Maybe you are used to seeing them shaved or slightly grown out. My 18 year old daughter shaved her arms from time to time. I still don't understand why.
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffrrvpg,t1_ffrq5le,1580164446.0,"It's amazing how easy it is to pull teens in the wrong direction. Especially if they don't have a family and community around them. I wound up with some new age hippies in my teens. Everything was all good until a few years into that life, still a teen at 18, I was introduced to heroin and that life which they had kept pretty hidden, and I fell in love with my first shot. Teens are easily manipulated."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffrrhu8,t1_ffrpk9n,1580164201.0,"Yeah, that life ends in prison or death. The people around you in the gang don't really give a shit about you. If they did they would be telling you to get out of the gang, go to college and establish a life, not shoot someone and wind up in prison. You don't tell people you care about to commit crimes that lead to prison or death. That's not even what you tell people you hate to do because it destroys the community. People living that life don't even care about their own life"

nosleep,ffrk06j,t1_ffrdedx,1580159593.0,"You may well be willing to be shot for your dog, or your brain may realise, when it takes over, that the person with the gun will only shoot your dog and not be willing to do life in prison for shooting your dog. I've had a gun put to my head by my kids dad when he was smoking crack one night before he came home jacked up, and broke. He was convinced I had money that was being kept from him. My brain took over and I only remember bits and pieces. I do know our brain is evolved enough that it takes over for us in life or death situations."
nosleep,ffrjl2a,t1_ffr634y,1580159339.0,"A great example is what to do if an elevator shuts down and/or starts to fall. I know in my head to stay calm, press the call button and wait for help. If need be lie on the floor of the elevator if it's gonna fall. About two weeks ago my daughter and I were in an elevator, and it was a nice one, but the skips, sudden stops, and LOUD Thurs from over head sent me into a panic mode. Looking back I would have had to work to remember what to do in that situation, because I was in panic mode. I have also had a revolver pulled on me and held two inches from my face. I didn't get so panicked I wet my pants but my brain took over for me and did what it took to get out of the situation. My point is we never know how we will react until it happens. You may well sacrifice yourself for your dog, but until that split decision moment we are clueless."

I've been sober for 4 years now and although I couldn't make direct amends to some people; I did make amends by volunteering at the day shelter and running the donation room making sure everyone had appropriate clothing for the weather a long with blankets and pillows when provided. I did a lot of shitty things, many worse that this, but most of them a) I either can't tell or it would be a concession and b) I made amends for them in the most direct way possible., or a living amends which is like the volunteer thing I did and/or just never doing the horrible thing ever again. Some things you just can't go confessing because I would get arrested and the 9th step of the AA 12 steps says: Made direct amends whenever possible except when to do so would injure others.
