AskReddit,ffqnwih,t3_euphwm,1580139515.0,"Browsing stubs since for few months only.
But most important things skip off.
As I cannot repaste half of question.
Which relate to my life.

Reddit app on android?"
SmashingFour,ffqnazf,t1_ffqm5px,1580139097.0,"It's about a bug where free rewards where disabled since purchasing season pass. 

How more can I clarify?"
SmashingFour,ffqn3em,t1_ffqmwyx,1580138952.0,"Thanks for update on downvotes..
Does this serve the purpose?

Instead of appropriate reasons to customers?"
SmashingFour,ffqmwyx,t3_euovg4,1580138827.0,"Are you guys serving or serious towards criticisms?
Ignore the wine whine thingy....
I have seen enough then you have ever  SERVED (...) If Any!! 

There was a question about free passes not open after season pass completion.
Hope you guys understand.

Since one of officials understood same.
And was looking forward for reply from customer support for that BUG....

And the official post goes underground.

Don't want a Google repay/refund back.
Never did it...

But whinging... People..."
SmashingFour,ffqk3ld,t3_euovg4,1580136768.0,"No response and respect for paying customers..

Very very disappointed.
I appreciated user smashing four (officials) opinion.
But same thing continues. New free season pass and winnings collapsed massive.

Was better on free user."
