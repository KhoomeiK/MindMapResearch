Until you, or someone else, figures out a way to give humans perfect judgment, they absolutely are a price we have to pay. 

At the end of the day, humans are fallible, and if one makes the wrong decision while driving a car (which, in a world with a ton of cars, and a ton of people, someone WILL eventually do) someone will die.

Yes, cars kill 40,000.

todayilearned,feoli6z,t1_feojfe6,1579301855.0,"Using horseback in 1988 is a terrible comparison. Also, using injuries instead of deaths doesn't make sense for obvious reasons.

[Using a comparison that actually makes sense, car fatalities per billion miles was 7.28, from 2000-2009. For comparison, commuter rail, mass transit rail, buses, and commercial aviation over the same period were 0.43, 0.24, 0.11, and 0.07](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~ipsavage/436-appendix.pdf) 

Using cars statistically causes more deaths, BY FAR, than any other method of modern transportation (other than motorcycle, but nobody thinks everyone should be riding motorcycles.)

It literally is a new death. Transportation related deaths have risen dramatically since the invention of the car, even though better alternatives currently exist. The entire point of the thought experiment is that people don't really know what they think they know, because they actually use bias and heuristics to get to an answer, even though they believe they are being logical.

Hell, you're actually doing it right now. Funny."
todayilearned,feoii3q,t1_feogaaq,1579300646.0,"> No it isnt. Cars inherently don't cause death. Saying 40,000 people a year will have to die is a morbidly assumptive thing to say and blatently false. 

[Except it's factually true that \~40,000 people die in the US due to cars every year.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year)

The use of the car in modern society empirically causes death. You can't just decide it's an assumption and hand wave it away.

Furthermore, death is absolutely an inherent property of interconnected traffic systems that rely on the car. If everyone took trains or buses everywhere, would our traffic fatalities remain the same? The answer is absolutely not.

AskReddit,fehwfrd,t1_feht615,1579125218.0,"You're hitting the crux of the problem, but not in the way you think.

Ultimately, the level at which a company becomes evil is completely arbitrary. 

Sure the community managers are not evil, but the people they report to are also just trying to do their jobs, who report to people that report to a board of investors, who ultimately don't have a lot of insight into how the company actually reaches the revenue targets that they choose to set. They just know that they've grown x in the past, so they should be able to grow roughly x in the future.

The point in time when a company goes from being perceived as evil instead of good is ultimately a failure in communication between upper management and investors, because nobody, at any level, has complete insight at what a lumbering behemoth like EA is doing. Nobody knows exactly when the growth of their business at x% will become unsustainable.

Investors rely on the employees at their companies realizing that the company has reached saturation in it's market share of games that it can realistically capture, so to grow, they need to rely on unsavory methods, like micro-transactions. Employees are never incentiveized to tell investors that they can't grow using the usual business practices, because their pay checks depend on them doing so.

The best companies have aligned incentives perfectly, to the point where every employee must be cool with telling the person above them that growth at x% can't continue in the factors they are monitoring. This happens at all levels, from the store manager doing monthly sales to the biggest investor in the company. It's why companies are constantly harping about culture, and it's why investing in management that can implement this is the number 1 rule of Warren Buffet."

Mismanagement is literally the main issue that people have when discussing socialized healthcare, at least in the United States where I live.

Simply because management structures are necessary for efficiency, and when the people at the top aren't incentivized to do a good job, it creates problems for everyone below them.
