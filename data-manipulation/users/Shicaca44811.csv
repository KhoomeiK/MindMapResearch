AdviceAnimals,ffijm4z,t1_ffgyzii,1579975431.0,"So I was the same way until I realized the reason was bc I had to tend to the stove nearly constantly to prevent burning. 

I am actually a pretty good cook, particularly when I am cooking outdoors, and realized that the reason I’m better with the grill is bc I have a hot and cold side, and unfortunately a pan does not have this.

I’ve since started pre-heating my pans before using them. I never had to do this till I got my house bc I had gas stoves before. I could go from cold ass pan to screaming hot in 2 minutes. This electric piece of shit takes eons, it seems. I now preheat the stove before getting anything out. On our stove a level 8 for preheating is good, and by the time I get things out and start cooking on it, it’s warm enough for a sear but also I adjust down nearly immediately now. More so if I’m going to cook more than one batch. 

TL;DR - Have your wife start preheating. I legit have to do this for ~4 minutes before it’s ready. Slowing the cooking lets you pick up in the mean time."

We had already invested $1k in Alexas, but the shitty tinny sound that came out of even the “better” speakers was jarringly bad to me. Their only huge ”We love it / can’t be without it” feature was the multi-room support. It just freaking works. 

After getting sick of the shitty sound from the Alexa’s, I asked for a 2 pack of Sonos One’s for Christmas a year or so ago. They’re SUCH a step up in audio over the legacy Alexas, but honestly after hearing the Gen 3 Alexa’s, they’re really a small step away from the Sonos One’s... this paired with the fact that my Sonos devices can’t join into the Alexa architecture fully to do certain functions like multi-room support, even though they have “full” Alexa, I’m really soured with our $350 purchase. 

At this point we’re going to sell the Sonos, get the Alexa Studio and another Gen 3 Alexa, and call it a freaking day. I’m sick of the devices not working as they should, and I’m sick to death of Sonos refusing to update their freaking firmware to make it work."

I live in a city with ~275,000 ppl.

They also cost 3-4x what they do there. Our baguettes and other specialty breads cost 3-5$. In Paris the baguettes were <1€ (~1$)

The cheeses are mostly mass produced even tho they’re “specialty” cheeses. There’s one store that we can get higher quality cheeses, but unless you get them on sale they’re also much more $. The sale cheeses are on sale bc they’re old. A sale Brie has lost its near pudding texture and is too solid. The non-sale cheeses at least taste good."

I’d un-follow those particular boards, and then they’d make a wedding 2.0 board. It was just all too much.

We drive a Subaru that is not the latest model, as well as a GM. The GM’s Infotainment system has frozen to the point where the only fix was to park, turn the car off, open/close the door, then wait for 5 minutes before starting it again. Had the HVAC been integrated, that’d mean we wouldn’t only not have entertainment (annoying but tolerable), but also not be able to change the heat/AC (NOT ok). 

The HVAC controls are still nobs. Out of curiosity, I looked at the current models. They fully integrated the HVAC into the Infotainment system. What a fucking dumb idea!

We‘ve driven on the toll road in West Virginia that bobs and weaves through the mountains. If I had to touch a screen for the HVAC, I’d be at danger of falling off the road, ramming another person, etc. This is NOT. A forward thinking feature. HVAC should be SIMPLE and something that can be done sans looking.  This trend of integrating everything into the Infotainment needs to stop."

In the last 24hrs we ended up getting ~3-4 inches of snow, and then it started raining. 

Our car looked very much like this one, and while using the scraper was overkill as it wasn’t adhered, the snow was so heavy it was VERY difficult to remove with the brush. 

To put it into perspective, I used our plug in snow blower to clear the drive. This same machine has handled 12” of dry snow with minimal issues. Today’s  snow made the blower struggle VERY hard to get through it, and even then I still had to manually clear it bc it got clogged more than once. 

Eventually I switched to a shovel for a small portion that the blower couldn’t get to (stairs, etc). I’m a fit guy, however the weight of removing 1 shovel’s worth of snow was nearly too much, and I definitely got a workout for sure.

relationship_advice,fene67m,t3_epmn97,1579282763.0,"Hey if you can write a novel so can I!

I had a VERY similar story to yours with my husband. Literally **EVERY** fight we had for the first 2-3 years were the result of rifts caused by the dog taking advantage of not having rules. I’m stubborn, and so is the dog, and that sounds like something that’s happening with you. 

Your dog needs work, but your frustration is that YOU know the dog needs work, and your gf thinks he’s an angel and you know that’s far from the truth.

Some things to note:

-	While the dog needs work, so does your girlfriend. She has to realize that the things you’re describing are NOT ok and the dog needs boundaries. This. Took. YEARS. 

-	Some of the things you’re describing are a dog being a dog. You’re only going to cause frustration trying to break him of these things, and TBH it’s what you’re signing up for living with a dog. 

1.	These types of things can’t be helped, or would be very difficult: 

-	The poop eating can be indicative of a poor or lacking diet. 
-	You’re going to have to deal with the peeing on his feet thing. Meet the dog outside with a wet towel and wipe before he comes in.
-	The fungus feet need to be treated, and guess what? That’s gonna be your job bc she’s obviously not going to do it. Go to the vet and get recommendations. Keep reading tho bc there’s other things they need to test for. 

2.	The wanting to go in and out constantly as well as whining MAY be related to boredom. You can help this in a few ways. You can get chew toys - Pig ears, nylabones, deer antlers, raw hides, etc. You can get plush toys to play with and throw with him. Get some ropes so you can play tug of war. You can rough house with him. You can play fetch. Or you can take him for a walk. Dogs his size should be walked a few miles each day.
3.	The digging his face and going ham in the covers. He’s honestly (albeit gross) having fun. 

-	The jumping on the bed with stuff on his feet (and, TBH, when you are not in bed yourself) is a no-no. Close the bedroom door when you’re not in the bedroom. As a benefit this allows you to not make the bed! 
-	Get him a dog bed that’s comfy and with sheets that he can do that with and it’s his. Buy an attractant so he’ll use it. 
-	The growling and biting is agression and needs to stop immediately. I have not had a dog do this, however they’re trying to show dominance (and you backing down GIVES them dominance). You need to research how to break this, but my go to is honestly may be not the best course (I would scream, smack, and then make them get off the bed). I highly recommend you find an expert for this one - and this one is serious. TBH, however, I don’t know if I could remain in the relationship if she was OK with this. This can also, though, be health related. 

-	The peeing in the house/wanting to go out constantly can be a few things:

1.	Urinary infection, diabetes, etc. When it goes out 15 times a day, does he pee every time? If so, you need to get him checked by a vet. 
2.	Dominance or acting out - The walks/activities and curbing dominant behaviors will help.
3.	Separation anxiety - your gf is likely making this worse just like my husband did. When you come into the house EVERY expert agrees that you LIGHTLY greet them with a flat voice, give them a VERY small pet (like 1-2 strokes), then let them outside. No more. No making a show and pomp and circumstance about it. If she comes home and raises her voice and gives praise, this encourages them to get hyped up and anxious that you’re not back yet, and creates an atmosphere of bad behavior when you’re not home. Our solution, after his (now our) dog pissed on the carpet daily as well as nightly when we slept was to relegate her to a room that she could not get out from. She lives in the LVT floor plank kitchen. We installed a sturdy baby gate and she’s there the entire time we’re gone. The pissing ended instantly. To note, my husband **LOST. HIS. SHIT.** when I suggested it. Until I woke up the one night and WITNESSED her pissing on the carpet while we slept. I woke him up and told him I’m going to be making a lot of noise bc I have to clean the carpets with the steam cleaner at 2am. It was not in a nice tone. It proved to him that the peeing in the house wasn’t an occasional thing and she’s peeing in the house ALL THE TIME. Now to note, she was NOT OK with being in the kitchen / not trying to escape for a long time. I’m not kidding, 6+ months. She’s an angel now, however. I suggest against using a door to lock the dog into a room bc they’ll feel trapped. Either a kennel (you have to size it appropriately), or a STURDY AF  baby gate or two are best cases. Your gf will absolutely have issues with a kennel. 

A suggestion is that you need to check YOURSELF. If you’re like me, you’re angry, frustrated, and you feel like you’re the only sane person in the house! You’re totally correct, but this comes out as being angry/aggressive and counterproductive to changing things. Your gf will not be accepting of this. 

Any changes or issues you want to make you need to discuss and keep discussing it even if she gets pissed off. If she refuses, start bringing it up in conversations with others and get their opinions. Sometimes friends saying the same things helps sway things. 

Sometimes you have to bend some. I wanted a kennel for the dog, he wanted the kitchen. I conceded with the caveat of “if she destroys things, this will have to be revisited”.  

Sometimes you’ll just have to get over yourself. I lost the battle of not sleeping with the dog in the bed. My compromise was that my husband must start moving her to HIS side of the bed. This made things infinitely better. Fast forward 3+ years and she now sleeps between my legs on top of the covers, which I have always preferred. If she wants you to also be in the bed then the dog needs to move over to HER side of the bed, not between you or laying on top of you, period. If he doesn’t move, he needs to be moved. If she’s not going to do this, the only other thing I can think of is getting a bigger bed. Sans this, the alternative is to not sleep at her house. 

Fast forward my husband and I have been together 10 years. He now flat admits publicly that I was right with the vast majority of the things and that the dog is MUCH better behaved since I took most of the training over. IMO the reasons he was so resistant was a few fold, but one is he didn’t want to release that control, but honestly IMO he also felt like I was being accusatory of him doing a poor job of training the dog."

You can’t believe that a person doing something illegal (either woman OR physician or family performing illegal abortions) to go out and proclaim from the rooftops, “I PERFORMED ‘x number’ OF ABORTIONS THIS MONTH!” This “huge jump” of abortions probably isn’t as “crazy” as you think it is... people just were able to -legally- do it and weren’t penalized with jail or being put to death if they were found out by authorities. 

As an aside... To be clear, I’m more of a “use everything else so you don’t have to have an abortion” kinda person. This said, I ALSO realize there’s circumstances where either this is not possible (rape/incest), instances where things failed (condoms break, birth control ineffective r / t antibiotics, vasectomies are not always 100% effective), etc. 

If you want abortion to be illegal or more locked down, this cannot come without a HUGE overhaul of our adoption system, or you’ll NEVER have a person such as myself **ever** vote for it.
