amateurradio,fdwpf6t,t3_en2peb,1578761094.0,"One of the issues you'll run into is the glass fiber bundles cause local changes in the effective dielectric constant, so the impedance of your trace will vary as you cross over a bundle or a void. At 24 GHz, the wavelength is short enough this may be noticable.

If you can't use a homogeneous material, maybe mechanically spread glass? Someone with more experience in that frequency range will have to weight in as to how much difference that really makes. Basically, the fiber bundles are flattened out, so the gaps between them are minimized, which creates a more consistent permittivity.

Isola FR408 has a similar permittivity to RO4003, but is offered as an MS fiber. I see OSHPark uses FR408 for their 4 layer stuff, but they don't specify the fiber spread. They also don't claim a tolerance on the permittivity."
