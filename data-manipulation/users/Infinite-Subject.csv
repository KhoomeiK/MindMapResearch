AskReddit,ffffzga,t1_fffaq0a,1579883133.0,"There are several versions. One where she is born the way she is typically portrayed, one where she is cursed for sleeping with Poseidon in Athenas temple and one where Poseidon raped her in Athenas temple and Athena turned her into the Medusa we know today for protection. 

I like the last one, because that version of Medusa became a symbol for some women seeking refuge from men. Either because they were raped, due to bad home environments or similar."
AskReddit,ffcqngy,t1_ffch2zi,1579805218.0,Easily the scariest part of the game! Watching my boyfriend climb around and explore the area was so tense. I’ve never experienced anything similar in a game.
AskReddit,ffcqirg,t1_ffcm2ly,1579805129.0,Same! Sharing ideas and experiences is really great and helps a lot with the inspiration when you’re in a rut.
AskReddit,ffcqdav,t1_ffcmt0d,1579805027.0,"Asking is fine, of course! 

But her actions were unbelievable. 
I do like making gifts for my friends and family, though, but a stranger? No."
AskReddit,ffcq2iw,t1_ffcnll4,1579804830.0,"This one actually offered payment, but I had no time nor desire to do it and I told her as much. 

She kept going on with “I know what you mean, my friends cousin is a leather worker blah blah... If I buy the materials, can you finish it before Friday?”

I told her I didn’t have time or the desire to, again. She said she understood, but kept telling me about what she wanted. 

Finally I turned to her and told her that no means no. 

To be fair, I think she was mentally impaired. A lot of things caused me to think that. Her inability to spell her own name (a very common one) at 32 was my final clue."
AskReddit,ffcpatj,t3_est2b4,1579804322.0,"A black cat. 

It was a thing a long time ago in my country. Now we just paint a black cat on a barrel full of candy and crown the first to damage the barrel and the one to knock it down Cat Queen and Cat King. 

A horrible thing, really."
AskReddit,ffcdv3u,t1_ffc19c5,1579797336.0,"It’s fairly obvious it wasn’t OP, from the “when *we* found out”, to be honest."
AskReddit,ffcd5s8,t1_ffbq61k,1579796897.0,"Often, if people hear about my hobbies (drawing, painting, sewing and crocheting) they just ask me to make them something... I had a classmate get very upset with me because I didn’t want to make her a bag.

In my experience, half the people who hear you have hobbies like that are only interested because they want something from you :("
AskReddit,ffcanqo,t1_ffc9jmi,1579795327.0,"Right?

And I knew nothing could hurt me, but I was still convinced an anglerfish was out to get me. I was so convinced, I had my boyfriend play the entire area. He was not good at it, but I couldn’t even look out to the water. It was so realistic and well done."
AskReddit,ffbski6,t1_ffbhvnm,1579781154.0,"Outer Wilds too. You’re essentially exploring a solar system. Eventually you reach a planet covered in water with tornadoes everywhere. I didn’t know and dived straight under the clouds, hit water, got thrown into orbit by a volcano and decided to never return."
AskReddit,ffa8csc,t1_ff7z7co,1579729864.0,"That seems so surreal to me. I grew up in a climate where we don’t get tornadoes. Worst we get is strong winds. I’ve never seen anything close to one. 

How can people be so chill about it? Those things are scary as fuck!"
AskReddit,fenefy8,t1_femqcyt,1579282928.0,"While my father never took out loans in my name, he stole all of my money and my inheritance from my mums death. He registered a car in my name and frequently abused my trust. 

I was 22 too. (or 20 to 22, if took years and meeting my SO to see how insane it was) 

Sometimes, you don’t think about it until you’re removed from the situation. Otherwise, it will ruin you. 

I’m glad you chose to see the positive side and I hope you’re doing much better now. 

And to those who called you stupid: It’s easy to judge when you’re removed from the situation and have no emotions connected to it. I hope you all never experience the same and that you learn to be a bit more kind to others. It would suit you well."
bulletjournal,fduengv,t1_fdu20vj,1578731982.0,"It makes me happy at the very least! 
But I think there’s a lot of very beautiful ones on this sub haha."
