cleanjokes,ffd9025,t1_ffd5q88,1579815774.0,"May as well go all out then. I'm going to describe a horse like I would a monster:

Its body is that of a gigantic, muscular canid. Its smooth, gleaming skin is stretched so tightly around it that the movement of its hard muscles can be seen clearly.

Its neck is thick, like a dragon's, but the features of its face are stunted, as though a crafter had run out of clay. Its teeth are horribly similar to those of a man, but a overgrown imitation; homunculus teeth. Its spine-spikes and non-present tail are also substituted with hair like a human's.

Most horrific of all, the heavy, hard mass of these creatures is balanced on dainty, delicate legs. Hyperspecialized fingers! It balances delicately on the nails of its not-legs.

It stands in its sleep, prepared to act the moment it awakes. It is startled easily, prone to throwing its weight around, kicking, and running. In spite of its finger-legs, this monstrosity's ""design"" is used to run. This creature!! Running! With such proportions!

Even further, if it runs to quickly or for too long, its lungs will bleed, its body will sweat a salty froth, its organs will burst, and its body will fail.

Looking at them, I can see clearly how these eldritch monstrosities must have once been men, twisted by defying a dark god in a time before time itself.
