dude I absolutely can´t comprehend why you americans can buy meds at the supermarket haha. Or is it a pharmacy inside the supermarket?

> The FDA tried cracking down on Kratom too and made it a schedule 1 drug, (same as heroin) but mass resistance made them reverse their stance

Yeah I remember that. There was so much uproar at /r/Drugs 

> It seems every non prescription drug you can use to get off stronger opiates is being gunned for in the US

I mean it´s not completely irrational. Opiod adiction is quite a probem in the US from what I hear.


But great to hear that you got off them! You´re probably on naltrexone right now right?


Edit: is cimetidine actually a pgp inhibitor? I´ve never heard about that"

You can also get loperamide (a peripheral opiod agonist against diarrhea for those who don't know) otc in Germany. It doesn't reach cns because of p glykoprotein functioning as an efflux pump in the dendrocytes. Then you drink tonic water and it becomes cns active because p-gp is inhibited"

YouShouldKnow,fgi9vff,t1_fggsfjz,1580813219.0,"Ah that sucks man. What you have is called polymorphism and is basically Gene mutations. Cyp450 is short for cytochrom p450 and is a huge enzyme family that metabolizes roughly 50% of all drugs. The enzymes are upregulated, thus they work more. There are also drugs that do that naturally (inducing cyp enzymes) like phenytoin and phenobarbital."
