To me, it's important to remind the players that the Kindred need to feed on other life, you know?

The player's not dumb enough to eat somebody in the middle of the street, but even if he did, the ST wasn't the type to go ""are you sure you want to do this?""

WhiteWolfRPG,feiwwmw,t1_fehzln6,1579149449.0,"Why do they care? Because the kine exist, and are always watching. Because they're (probably) used to having clean clothes and a place to call their own (and the Beast is territorial). Because not everybody, especially neonates, has the Protean or Vicissitude to sleep anywhere there's ground. Because there are needs and creature comforts in life and unlife both, and those need money more often than not. Because you can't bribe most people to ignore or do something by promising them a favor. Because automotive transportation is the fastest, easiest, and safest way to get around unless you've got Celerity 8 or something.

Homelessness is very much an obstacle for Kindred, it's just a \*different\* obstacle than it is for humans. Almost nobody's going to turn and immediately take the long view of an elder; you're still going to have a very human mentality for decades at least, more likely than not.  

 On top of all of that... most kindred have standards which are more than just the bare minimum for survival. They don't want to eke out a living hunting what they can every night, then finding somewhere new to hunker down every sunrise. They're VAMPIRES now, and they want to own the night. They have power now, and want to show that.  

Even a crappy apartment gives a level of security and mental well-being (going back to ""a place to call their own"") that sinking in to the earth every day can't. You can't really add security to a random spot of earth, unless you've got a level of power that's beyond most Ancillae."
