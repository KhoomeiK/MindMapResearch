clevercomebacks,fg48o30,t1_fg463gd,1580498495.0,"Ugh, that makes me so irrationally angry. Being told to smile makes me want to rip the person's mouth off their face like a rabid chimpanzee.

Dudes don't get complimented enough.
YouShouldKnow,fg3zqzb,t1_fg3ujjf,1580493133.0,"I'm thinking that staring at nothing and speaking calmly is an immediate sign of trauma in not only my own experience, but from reading through these comments about how others have reacted the same way. I can't talk about my own stuff without zoning out and losing all emotion. I especially can't look at people. If I didn't zone out then talking about it would probably start a panic attack or crying."
