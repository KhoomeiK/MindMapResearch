legaladvice,fgv6nij,t1_fgv5i6y,1581138723.0,"there is no way to stop the eviction. a tenant can still be evicted from an illegal room. been here 4 years and there has always been 7 tenants. in January 2 moved out and the landlord gave me eviction notice same month and hasn't filled the vacant rooms so his strategy is to pretend there only 5 tenants here and he lives in the attic and he is exempt from just cause because it's a ""single family home""

he also claims to be living in the other illegal boarding house so he can be exempt from just cause there too. but proving it is difficult. so to answer your question I think my goal is focusing on the affirmative response to the UD when he gives it to me next month when I don't leave. having the notice of violation from the city would help me in negotiating money to resolve it.

the fact that I paid rent for 4 years when there were 7 tenants in a 4 bedroom house along with the landlord in the attic is a fact that can't be contested. the investigator said he was going to issue the NOV when he was here and was adamant about that. based on his email that seems to have changed.

jobs,fgot1m8,t3_ezplk3,1580985216.0,"Sorry for what you went through. I got a contract a high profile tech company recently that is often in the news. The recruiter was lovely until I filled out forms with my age. Never in my career have I been treated is such a heatless hostile way. From the first day my cold unfriendly manager said she ""decided not to give you the projects as planed"" and refused to talk to me, smile at me when I passed her in the hall, invite me to lunch, send a group message welcoming me. She refused to give me any work. At all. It was so humiliating. She asked co-corkers for any damaging information I might have said. She was angry I was late one morning although I asked in advance for approval and offered to cancel the appointment.

The CEO at the company has made comments in the past about preferring young workers but I never imagined it would be that cruel. I also took a job off my resume so I would seem younger and I think the problem started when I filled out the forms with DOB. It was a permanent job through an agency working onsite. I finally decided to email the person at the agency about how I was treated but they already disabled my email account. They called at 8pm to say I was terminated and wouldn't provide any details ""it has to be confidential"" except that I was heard talking about the chances of being converted to FT and the high profile company whose delusional CEO thinks he might one day be President had declared that is grounds for termination. Not surprisingly another contractor killed himself at the job a few weeks before me.

My advice is to focus on smaller companies. They seem more open to mature people with lots of experience instead of only people in their 20s (and based on what I saw there its was the confusing unorganized department I ever worked in) which is why they don't want mature people there. you're too good at the job and might actually show them how the can improve things."
SandersForPresident,fgosgnk,t3_ezp7wr,1580984382.0,"Remember all the tweets from Trump about Hillary being associated with GS? Then once he wins he puts a former Goldman Sachs person in charge of the Treasury Department. There hasn't been time since the Clinton administration when our country hasn't had someone from GS in charge of policy or in the Treasury department. 

Having worked in finance a lot I heard rumours that the Treasury Sec position is actually ""sold"" to the candidate who wins. It's why Larry Fink was getting ready to choose the drapes for his office if Hillary won. There are tons of brilliant finance people not associated with a Wall St bank who could do it but they say ""We need a person from Wall St because they understand the business."" People don't want Wall St in charge of Treasury anymore or having an influence on policy. Trump also wanted JPM CEO Jamie Dimon. Yet his platform was as a ""populist"" who was going to ""drain the swamp""

It's important that people know Buttiglieg is putting Goldman Sachs in power if he is elected. I disagree with the strategy that you don't insult the opponent. Being nice doesn't work in politics. This isn't a bake off. Bernie has to put on the boxing gloves and get aggressive. He did what the Establishment wanted (supported Hillary when she won the primary and the insane claims that Putin stole the election) and how did they pay him back? By trying to take Iowa from him.

He needs to do more to get women angry Hillary lost and blame him on his side. He could invite women to a round table discussion with him and Hillary to discuss their feelings and why they're still angry and how they can get past that. Pretending women aren't angry doesn't help. I've seen it. They don't like Bernie."

IAmaKiller,fgo6ka4,t1_fgo2zl1,1580961018.0,"Nobody knows that. The only people who know when or if it happened are Carmen, her husband (now dead so can't provide details) and her son. I find it hard to believe her husband would abuse her in front of Mark so he must have heard about it from Carmen and maybe her son. 

And Mark clearly feels loyal towards both Carmen and her son. He said that he didn't know any details about why the son went to jail which isn't believable. There isn't any evidence that the husband said he was planning to kill Mark either. Maybe Carmen or her son told Mark that so he would be angry. Only Carmen would get the insurance money so Mark either did it out of loyalty and anger over the miscarriage (although there isn't proof it actually happened) and abuse or they paid him to do it. 

Initially Carmen denied any involvement when he called her from jail yet she later admitted she knew what he was planning before he did it. In order to get her to admit that they must have had damaging information on her but the episode doesn't reveal that. Mark said he didn't love her in a sexual way although admits they had sex a few times. She had to have sex with him to get pregnant or pretend to be pregnant so he would be easier to manipulate.

IAmaKiller,fgl8dfj,t3_ez4vbh,1580885660.0,"There were two episodes that had an impact on me and made me think more about whether the death penalty should be abolished. 

David Barnett had no history of violence prior to the incident with his grandparents. He wasn't there to rob them. I believe that when he confronted them about what John did and they didn't believe him he had some form of a psychotic break or perhaps PTSD from the sexual abuse. Although he went to the police with a picture that indicated there was a problem with John he wasn't removed from the home and placed with another family. The system that failed him now wants to kill him. 

Kenneth Foster received the death penalty although he didn't shoot the victim because of the ""law of parties"" that people involved in a crime should know that people can be killed. It doesn't make sense that they planned to kill him in a neighborhood where people would hear the shot although criminals aren't always logical. But I don't believe Foster knew the victim was going to be shot although he has to take responsibility for being involved. I believe he has remorse and is a different person than he was back then. 

I also noticed that although every episode was about a person who got the death penalty they didn't speak with anyone who was involved in sexual assault and then killed the victim and I wonder if that decision was intentional because it would be difficult to feel any sympathy for them or if it's that those people didn't want to talk to them."

I used to be able to with older versions of the phone but now when I click on ""import photos"" and ""allow"" prompt on phone it searches for pictures and eventually ""finds"" all the photos but then nothing happens. There is no option to click on a photo to import it and I can't see the photos.

Instead of doing that I emailed the pics to my gmail account from my phone and for awhile it worked. I would then access the gmail on the laptop and save the pics to the drive so I could access them that way. Now when I try to do that nothing happens. I click on the iphone photo and send to my gmail account but I don't get the email. It seems as if this iPhone is incompatable with my Samsung laptop but I understand why I could email them a week ago but not now. I also increased the cloud storage on my iPhone.

Why was her doctor there? It's not realistic that out of all the people who didn't survive she just happened to be there waiting for her. My belief is this indicates that she died possibly while giving birth because it doesn't make sense."

None of the tenants would be homeless if they didn't live in his two illegal boarding houses. They have jobs or are students although it's difficult to find affordable rooms.

The only reason I filed a complaint with the city is because they told me that they can't document how many occupants live in a house or they will ""get in trouble"" so there wasn't a risk of a red tag. They still have an obligation to enforce their own policies."
bayarea,fg8bera,t1_fg89ljv,1580614638.0,"The entire situation is stressful and weird. The slumlord has been staying here since he gave me the eviction notice so he can pretend this is his primary residence. He doesn't work since this is such a lucrative scam so he is here every day in the attic with the door open which is ok since he is allowed to do that.

Anyway the day the investigator from the city was here he just happened to be gone the entire day so he couldn't see any of the locked rooms or the attic. The investigator said he didn't call him since he didn't know his number. 

The slumlord and his GF don't walk their dogs enough and often have them go to the bathroom in our backyard so there are feces there. A few weeks ago when he was gone I went around and picked them up and they clearly had been there awhile. Today I took pics of the dog poop in the yard. I looked up at the attic window but the curtains were closed. About an hour after that the landlord went into the yard to clean up the poop which he has never done before. 

It wouldn't surprise me if he was watching me with a cameras. It can't be a coincidence."

netflix,fg807if,t1_fg7y8u2,1580606034.0,Agreed but also negligence from the lawyer because he could have found that evidence if he tried and also could have had a psychologist testify. It's possible that when he confronted the grandparents and they accused him of lying he had a psychotic breakdown that might have been prevented with medication. Yet the system that failed him now wants to kill him.

In 2015 a tenant reported him to the city for converting the garage into an illegal apartment, lack of heat and roaches. The city inspected the premises and he had to make changes. They gave him more time to do that. It was approved. 

During that time he evicted the tenant who complained. There is nothing in the record about how many tenant were in the house but apparently in the bay area they won't document that because they will ""get in trouble"""

Adults understand that physical violence is never the solution. If your brother is being bullied he will hurt the bully more by ignoring them then by fighting them. Bullies want a reaction. By fighting him he gives them power. It takes a strong person to walk away instead of fighting but that is what he needs to do."

There is another option. Don't take the new job but start applying to other jobs at other companies that would still be in a technical role. You're still employed and not about to lose your job so you have time to find a better job that is still in a similar role.
bayarea,fg7c4eo,t1_fg7arw2,1580588945.0,it seems to me the bay area needs more high rise buildings with mixed retail and residential units similar to NYC and Chicago. Hayes Valley still has thriving stores. Noe Valley too. But Union Square has lots of vacant stores and Castro and most other areas. I think Noe Valley has a lot of young parents with high income who support local business and Hayes has lots of tourists with money but other areas have a difficult time finding a business that can afford the rent.
