atheism,fek37n8,t1_fek1myn,1579191653.0,"My initial comment ends, “Neither will managing Mythos solve problems that are fundamentally logistical.”  Which it sounds like you’re re-iterating here.  But you go on to dismiss Mythos as an unfortunate side-effect of our biology.  Perhaps it is, but it's a necessary one.  We don't live outside our biology.  Moment-to-moment, we don't live in the objective world.  Rather, we live largely within our imaginations.  To plan for anything, we must imagine the future.  To remember is a creative rather than truly recollective act, and so we imagine to remember.  The input from our sensations are very incomplete, and so we must imagine the gaps are filled to form an impression of the present.  To reject Mythos is to reject imagination and (as you point out), running from yourself will ruin your life.

The scientific method cannot be utilized to discover fundamental truths regarding value.  No universal law adds meaning to life, nor will it direct the values you choose to prioritize.  Precise repetition of an experiment adds data, confirms or refutes.  Precise repetition of a work of art is only a copy.  If we'd like religion to have less of a hold on the world, we cannot dismiss Mythos as useless.  We have to offer people methods for managing Mythos and its relationship to Logos in a healthy way.  Because improper management can lead to the things you're warning against."
