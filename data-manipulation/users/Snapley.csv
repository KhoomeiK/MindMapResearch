AskReddit,fff4a7i,t3_et8vh3,1579875316.0,"Well my dad gave me his old phone that he hadnt used in a while and this was before smartphones, it was like a Nokia or Sony Ericsson type. I was like 10. It had some pretty cool games, including a poker game where if you completed it, you could see some topless women. I felt so so guilty about it being there but also knew it wasnt my fault. I had a lot of guilt issues around sexuality in general I think because my parents would never talk to me about anything remotely sexual and would always just act like it was a really bad and punishable thing. Anyway one day my friend came round and was able to play the poker game until she unlocked all the topless women for me. That was fun until I got really really guilty over it and deleted the game. 

About a week later my dad asked to look at my phone and ""show me how to use it"" and he was saying shit like ""okay so you can delete stuff like messages and games let me show you"" and he went into the games, obviously trying to find the poker game to delete it. But he saw that I had already deleted it and seemed pretty flustered. He mumbled something about it being my uncles phone before hand and went off. I dont think that was true.

Anyway that was a real scary time for me as a lot but I can only look back and kinda laugh at how morally wrong I thought I was for looking at some pixel titties. Just had this weird idea that if anyone knew I'd touched myself that I'd get beaten really badly or put in some kind of jail for kids. I was also really afraid of a red and black poster in the doctors office that said ""under 25 and sexually active? Speak to our doctors...."" because I had masturbated before and thought that made me sexually active. The poster looked so scary. 

Anyway yeah educate your kids and dont accidentally leave your porn games on your phone."

I wish any doctor would just fucking listen to me and take me seriously. None of the other people my age need to sleep all day long.
