As for tips, I would say don't be intimidated to ask profs (older students or other people in your class) for any advice with assignments or just general understanding, however dumb you think it sounds. 

Pay attention in your classes early on as you'll need that stuff throughout.

While you probably didn't go into physics to learn math, it will be a good friend - in a bunch of courses, with some profs, you can almost get by with no physics understanding if you can just do the math.

Oh and I guess one thing I would do differently is to think about careers sooner than you might expect, then choose courses accordingly. You're probably there for some sort of career progression at the end of the day.

You can test this on PC where you can run the exact same game at exactly the same settings on exactly the same hardware. 

Use an old version of drivers alongside a more modern one, which has been optimised for a particular game, and you will often notice a (sometimes huge) performance difference.

Devs often write their games with console drivers and hardware in mind, as it is a lot easier to develop for one specific set of drivers and one specific set of hardware.

Sure - they occur when our body detects cold and warm respectively. In a direct attempt to warm or cool the body. But our body only actual detects changes in temperature - so when we feel warm, we are feeling our skin warming up (because the nerve cells are beneath our skin). 

Furthermore, these processes will only be ""active"" for as long as you feel too warm or too cool. That is, when you are back to your previous temperature, your blood flow will be back to how it was before. It will not continue to cool you further. 

There is absolutely no logical argument that additional heat can cool your body, even when you factor in the ways in which the human body attempts to maintain its internal temperature, as they are merely attempts to **maintain** that temperature.

The body does not want to cool itself out of control.

A cool shower will obviously cool you more, it physically removes heat energy for a while. If that triggers restricted blood flow, you have cooled yourself too much and need to warm up again.

Similarly, a hot shower will heat you up, it physically adds heat energy to your body. If that triggers extra blood flow, you have heated yourself too much and your body is trying to cool *back to its previous temperature*"
