todayilearned,ffmlmx0,t1_ffmf9qu,1580056353.0,"No, headphones in every open office environment I've worked in (Corp offices and coworking offices) almost always mean the person is busy. Let's not pretend like cubicle farms are pin drop silence, they aren't, I worked in them before open offices were incorporated to piss off shitty workers. It has nothing to do with noise canceling at all. Mine are not.

Or maybe, just maybe, work at place where people aim to be as productive as you if you are magnitudes above them and constantly feel annoyed by their presence."
todayilearned,ffml0bm,t1_ffmgjlq,1580056107.0,"No you're missing the entire point to pick arguments. Would I want a private office with a sick downtown view and an extendable pole for dancers? Fuck yeah I would!

Can I work in an open office where people see headphones = do not disturb? Absolutely I can! If you reread my comment you'll see I spend most of my time at coworking locations, if you don't understand the relevance of that I highly suggest visiting one.

Point is, people not looking to work will manage to not work regardless. As someone that considers himself to be a highly efficient worker, open offices don't bother me at all and I enjoy not feeling like the walls are always ready to close on me."

PoliticalHumor,ffmiau4,t1_ffmfj42,1580055096.0,"Nay. While we could agree that what Bill did was highly unprofessional, disrespected the office, his marriage, and then lied about it... Let's not make it out to be anything but completely consensual sexual acts between two adults. 

Bill's investigation was kicked off by Monica's coworker taping their calls. I'm sure you can find these calls on YouTube. You can hear Monica brag about it on call and speak about Bill like he was just another fuck buddy. She even later came out and specifically spoke about it being consensual. Yes, she got horrendous treatment from press and the world in general for it. But whether it was power, Bill's resources or his looks... She absolutely went in to suck that dick like he was the last guy on earth. 

We can't simultaneously say women are equal and then take away the sexual agency of a fucking adult. Can't just pick and choose where it benefits. There is no shortage of women willing to fuck rich, powerful, older men for whatever gain you feel like they are/aren't getting out of it."
todayilearned,ffma87g,t3_eu5wt2,1580051336.0,"I left my cubicle in Chicago a few months ago to become a digital nomad. I have been working out of coworking locations on the regular with some coffee shops thrown in as well. I have to say I was overwhelmed with not just open office but open coworking places where everyone has different goals/deadlines and can be very very distracting.. 

But my fear was short-lived. I put on my big headphones whenever I wanted to not talk to people around me/took them off when I was available for dicking around. I never have a fixed desk and sometimes I need to move around for calls. People complaining about these concepts are the same ones that say Slack is a distraction (I single handedly credit this app for allowing me to work remotely from around the world). 

Learn how to focus and tune out your coworkers and notifications. Start conditioning people around you on what makes you bothered/not available to talk. Tell people you gotta do work. 

All this shitting on open offices gives the illusion that cubicle farms are so much better. They are not. Your focus isn't being deprived by the ability to see others, it's deprived because you don't know how to focus. 

Watch Office Space."

Even if he had not started Amazon he still would have ended up in the top 1% of the world staying on the path he was on.

science,ferpme5,t1_feriej2,1579356921.0,"I'm a pretty chill guy and a manager at my workplace. It's a stressful job with tough deadlines, very difficult consulting projects etc. I'm also good and work hard to make sure everything happens.

But I've realized that being the chill guy always results in executives pushing more and more work my way knowing they can expect it to be done. I know this is not uncommon at other places as well.

So this week during a 25 hour shift I snapped on some emails because no one else was doing their jobs. Wrote a very detailed angry email  to other managers on how their lack of effort is fucking me and it's not cool. I hate being the hot tempered guy and now mildly regret sending that email but if I hadn't, I'd find myself in the same shitty spot again.

Not sure what the balance is. I don't want to sound like a pissy child but constantly playing it cool also makes it seem like I'm here to get screwed."

OP said she was unsure about it being rape initially. Or maybe schools require a police report to consider it rape? Then filing/reporting it as rape?

I'm not claiming to be an expert on rape laws here but I think it's absolutely relevant to determine if an accusation is true or not. I graduated 5 years ago and the word ""rape"" had become a loud speaker across campus. There were ""slutwalks"" and rape education events. There were discussions about requiring third-party witnesses to sign consent forms for students having sex in dorms. It was fucking insanity and made me worry about every hookup at that time.

AskReddit,femi7c0,t1_fem511h,1579256870.0,"Nah man don't think of it like that. Attraction is a fucking retarded concept. You'll hear people say they want X and see them bending over at a bar for Y. They'll justify their shallowness by saying ""it's just biology, lol"". They are morons looking to fill their insecurities with whatever society deems as great in that moment. Fuck them. You don't want that trash for more than one shot. If you just need one shot there are plenty of options no different than picking up girls by getting a table at a club. As they age you'll see their priorities shift 180. Again they are morons with no concept of what's after the next two steps. 

I would highly highly suggest you start with physical fitness. Go to gym, take self defense. This will not only clear your head and lift your mood but also push you towards better eating habits, better lifestyle, more interested in looking good (don't need to go overboard with this). No need to sign the most expensive trainer and drop $1k on protein, just start at the cheapest level. If you become a regular, you'll make great friends. These people are way friendlier than they look, I promise. 

Work on your income. Doesn't matter what you do and how comfortable you are, constantly work on getting ahead. Ranking up, making more. This isn't for the girls (remember the one shot thots above?), but for you. For you to have independence, take trips, buy toys, whatever. 

When you do these things you will always have a goal to work towards, this alone is why I wake up every day. I have to hit my goals. They will be hard, they will leave me exhausted but I don't give myself an out. I just have to do it. 

If you do these things, your relationship with yourself and girls will change drastically, I promise. You may meet someone along the process and then you get to decide what you're looking for. The goal here is not to get a girl, it's to become independent enough to not need one to be happy. You don't owe them anything, you owe only yourself to see the best version you can be."

They are giving up a small portion of their income (5%) while requesting tax-funded security, trips - essentially acting as a diplomat but only when they feel necessary.

I can say with certainty they can live out the rest of their lives in comfort with security from only the gains on their private investments. But that isn't what they want. They want the lavish Royal treatment, while not having the negatives of performing Royal duties and being in the public eye.

personalfinance,fe7oytq,t3_enxup7,1578917523.0,"I did this with similar numbers and city. I would highly suggest you check rents in Lincoln Park/Lakeview - while those areas have gotten expensive over the years, you might find a good deal on Craigslist. You won't be in walkable distance but will still save after train pass (check with work if it's pretax). Downtown living kinda sucks imo and not worth it unless you're doing 60+ hours/week. 

I didn't have a great living situation at home so I knew in order to focus on work and bring in the $$$ I needed to have my space to decompress after work and enjoy a bit of the city on the weekend. Obviously don't go crazy as loans are a big priority but definitely do what allows you the greatest return over time. No point in staying at home if it could lead to burning out and potentially hurting your chances of advancement.

This sub hates anyone that's not focused on retirement after stepping out of the womb but you're 23, your loans are high but so is your income (you're making above the median household wage and you're just getting started). Just know that rents do go up over the years and once you move out, you'll definitely not want to move back in. Factor this in your calculations in regards to loans, understand how long you'll be paying and what would mean for any other goals (house, hookers, blow etc.). Once you feel comfortable with the projection, go for it."

I remember a stat where US forces lost some 4500 men and women while by the time Iraqi civilian death toll was over 100,000.
