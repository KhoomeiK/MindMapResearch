I'm not crazy about nose chains but I think even they look good. They're the right color. I love the concentric circle in the nose ring and the earrings. and the hint of gold on the eyelids. Even his lip color is pretty.

Unironically I love this, I think it's the coolest expression of self I've seen today."

FridgeDetective,ff58o6b,t3_erh7z6,1579583532.0,I'm not very good at this. But I'm going to guess you're on a diet. That's why you do all the food prepping and have so many low cal drinks to fit in your calorie goal. You live alone. I'm gonna guess not Asian. But you do like Asian food. Strawberry Milkis is great.

LifeProTips,ff4zem3,t1_ff4mg4n,1579576147.0,"They tend to have pretty good quality control on their stock. I think that's a big reason why people have such a high opinion of Costco. They find the quality reliable enough to ""risk"" the money on bulk purchases if that makes sense.

I would not say Costco replaces a grocery store for most people, but it is a great way to save money on staples. Of course it depends on how much you're buying anyway. A person living alone is going to get a lot less out of Costco than a family.

I grew up in a family that buys mostly from Costco and supplements with stuff from discount supermarkets. I think it's one of the best ways to shop."
LifeProTips,ff4ypiv,t1_ff4mhd8,1579575653.0,You can write a note on your costco shopping list to review this information next time you're there. Just jot down something that will make you think to check your screenshot.

I haven't been at my UGW again since. But each time I've lost weight since, my self image has improved accordingly.

But also I wasn't finished going through puberty the first time I lost weight so that may have been a factor. That kind of thing frequently has an impact on EDs, especially for girls."

EDAnonymous,ff1tbiy,t3_er60tp,1579485712.0,"Sometimes I try to give my body other, less indulgent carbs so it can get over the craving itself. Like chocolate oatmeal or a mug of sweetened milk.

I know it's really hard but please try to take care of yourself. Make sure you're caught up on sleep. Get some fresh air if you haven't lately. I think if you start starving yourself again, your body is going to protest, so let it relax for a little. Try to eat filling and nutritious foods, and get lots of electrolytes if you've been making yourself sick. I know it's really hard. But just try to give yourself at least a couple days to balance out so your body is not so strained and doesn't fight so much. I think this will help you in the long run. â™¡"
