I didn’t dive into Harry Potter until after my youngest was born. So I missed my chance for this kind of photo shoot. You better believe they had a Potter party when they turned 11, tho!"
offmychest,feoatwb,t1_fenioco,1579297508.0,"Luckily, with my current classification, I make the same amount as anyone else in the same classification, even if it took a college degree to hire that person. But, it's taken me 20 years to get to where I'm at now.  Whereas someone with a degree could get hired at my level straight out of college. We still get the same paycheck, but it took them a shorter amount of time to reach the classification."
offmychest,fen81y7,t3_eq0mo8,1579279008.0,"It seems so much more complicated and difficult now than it used to be. When I was barely out of high school, I got an ""entry level"" job that allowed me to promote from within just on experience alone. If I applied for my job today, even with the number of years in my field, I wouldn't even be considered for an interview without at least a Batchelor's degree. In fact, I've participated in a number of interview panels myself, and the hiring supervisors rarely even glance at the resume/application that doesn't include graduation from college. Job history is hardly a factor anymore. So now, you spend ridiculous amounts of money to get a degree which is supposed to make you qualified to apply... but now there's a ton more people with degrees fighting for the same opportunity to even get their foot in the door. I was lucky to have gotten the opportunity I had 20 years ago because today those opportunities would no longer be available to someone like me."
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fekm9v3,t1_fekknas,1579202995.0,"It can be incredibly stressful to try and shoulder the burden alone. I'm extremely introverted and isolate myself from most everyone because I have very limited energy for others after struggling with my own mental health and family drama. So I don't have any friends outside some acquaintances at work. These are not people I'd share such intimate things with about my life. So finding support is incredibly difficult. Having places like this to find people struggling with the same issues is both a blessing and a curse. You can see how supportive a community of ""strangers"" can be... but you're also more apt to compare your situation to others' and may end up feeling like you shouldn't complain because others have it worse than you. 

Truth is, that'll always be the case. There's always someone struggling through something more difficult, more traumatic. But that doesn't invalidate your experience in any way. And you deserve the support you need. If you ever need someone to commiserate with, you're welcome to message me.  I believe my husband and I have made great strides towards repairing what was broken, but we may never fully heal and I may always need somewhere safe to express that pain."
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fekj6be,t3_epkxfb,1579201150.0,"I was in a similar situation with my husband a couple of years ago. We bought a house 4 years ago and, after living there for a couple years, he started casually chatting with our neighbor over the fence when we were both in our yards. She had a young son that would play in the yard and he kind of played with him over the fence (tossed a ball, etc.) just being friendly. It didn't take long for the casual conversation to become more personal and they made fast friends. They had a ton of things in common and started to spend a lot of time talking, because my husband worked a graveyard shift so he was home during the day and she was a single mom who was unemployed and living off welfare. They were both alone much of the day while our kids were in school. Eventually he was regularly offering her moral support through her relationship problems and helping her out when she needed rides, or someone to watch her son. His presence became her safety net. Basically, she loved the attention and exploited the ""damsel in distress"" narrative.

I  was incredibly uncomfortable from the beginning. I felt like she was competing with me for my husband's attention and ultimately got to spend more alone time with him than I did because they were both home all day and I had a regular 8-5 job. They were really close pretty quickly.  They also spent time doing things together that I was either not home to participate in or had previously not expressed any interest in doing (like the fact that they both loved to hike).

Despite my discomfort, I never talked to him about it. I sat back and watched their friendship get closer. I sat by when people would see them together and assume they were a couple. They would laugh it off as if the idea was ludicrous, but continued their close friendship, the intimate conversations, the flirty behavior... insisting it was all innocent fun.  But they both suspected that their friendship made me uncomfortable and often texted about me not liking the time they spent together. She would ask about if I was okay with the intimate details of our life that he was sharing with her. They marveled at the fact that I never spoke up about it, but were pretty confident that I was harboring resentment and jealousy of their friendship. My husband and I would talk about it sometimes and for a long time I just tried to brush it off and tell myself I was being paranoid and needed to stop being jealous. It ate away at me til it made me suicidally depressed. He felt me pulling away and had no idea why, because I was afraid to express how much it bothered me even after he'd asked.

It came to a head when he confronted me about our lack of intimacy. He didn't understand why I was making myself emotionally and physically unavailable to him. He had no idea my resentment made me not want to let him be close to me or touch me anymore. He had no idea that the more I pulled away, the more he sought emotional support from her. They had even started talking about him feeling neglected by me and she's the one who told *him* to talk to *me*. During the conversation, he admitted to me that he'd thought about whether or not he was capable of having an affair with her if she had pursued him. And when he realized he might, he knew it had gone too far. I finally admitted how I had felt all this time. How upset it made me.  He let me read all their texts, answered all my questions honestly and without defensiveness, let me express anger and heartache at the boundaries he'd crossed in his closeness with her. Let me point out the ways they talked to each other and behaved with each other that turned their ""friendship"" into an emotional affair. He didn't even realize that it was happening. He had let her suck him into her drama by giving him the support he wasn't getting from me. She was doing it because she liked controlling him. He told me if I'd expressed all of this in the beginning, he'd never have even pursued the friendship to begin with.

As soon as the feelings were out in the open, he started reevaluating his behavior and we had a lot more conversations about their friendship and his role in her life. Through our conversations, he started to recognize that she had enjoyed doing what she was doing because she craved male attention and validation. Her behavior was inappropriate and she KNEW it, but pursued it anyway because she liked his attention. She almost enjoyed the fact that he paid more attention to her than he had been paying to me. I pointed all this out and my husband disengaged from her drama. He stopped being her emotional support. He changed the way he spoke to her or responded to her texts and put distance between them, avoiding their previously intimate conversations.  Once he understood what had happened from my perspective, he immediately took steps to back off and, when she recognized she was losing her safety net, she found another man that would shower her with attention. She settled for a guy she didn't even really like all that much because she could manipulate him the way she'd been manipulating my husband. She's since moved, and they're no longer friends.

His perspective about their behavior was different than mine initially, but I had to express the boundaries that he'd crossed for him to recognize he was hurting me. That alone changed his behavior. That's how I knew we were going to be okay. Things between us are different now. We're both putting effort in where we were lacking before. The energy he poured into the emotional connection he had with her, he's pouring back into me. I've reengaged and am making strides to forgive and communicate. Our conversations are deeper and more reflective. We talk about how we got to where we were. But we talk about her in the context of how she changed us. She was the catalyst for so many changes in our relationship, but we're stronger now than we were before he met her. We're both putting efforts in that we'd stopped making a long time ago which motivated him to seek solace somewhere else in the first place.

Sorry for the novella, I don't want to hijack your thread with my own story. I just wanted to share with you that you're not alone in feeling like maybe you don't belong here. But if you feel betrayed... then you do belong here. Period. And if your husband does anything other than back off now that he understands that he's hurting you, there's a problem. His intentions and his belief that he's ""doing nothing wrong"" are both irrelevant. *You* should be his priority. Your relationship should be more important.

AmItheAsshole,fe3k4u9,t3_enmoij,1578850004.0,"ESH, but  here’s why.

My first instinct was to say not the asshole. You have no obligation to provide an explanation at all. It’s your life and your body. If you don’t want children, it shouldn’t matter what the reason is. You don’t owe her anything and the idea that anyone would choose to have children for someone else’s satisfaction is ridiculous. If you have kids, you’re doing it for you, not her. Or anyone else for that matter. 

BUT...telling her she’s the reason would just be stoking a fire. Are you prepared for the fallout? Your healing from the traumas of your own childhood may include confronting your mother about how she hurt you. But u til you’re ready for that conversation, I wouldn’t spark it in anger over the piece of your life she’s trying to control now.  When you address that, be prepared to address everything. Because there’s no way it ends with her accepting your answer and letting it go. 

You should know though, it is possible to break the cycle of abuse. I am nothing like my parents and my children recognized the difference every time they spent time with their grandparents. You can choose to be different than your upbringing. So if that is the only reason you don’t want kids, you should know it doesn’t have to be that way. Regardless of how we are raised, all parents are scared that they will screw up. You can be better than your mother, though. If I learned anything from mine, it was how NOT to be.

But if in your heart, you don’t see kids in your future, that’s nobody’s business but yours."

LowLibidoCommunity,fdniiae,t3_emamug,1578586517.0,"There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be better, as long as it’s for you. He will benefit from your self improvements, but he should not be the reason you are working on it. You need to want it for yourself, outside of his desires, in order to make the changes needed to “be better”. 

I struggled with low libido and co-dependency for years, feeling like a horrible failure to my husband. I was also on medication to treat my bipolar disorder which affected me physically even when I wanted to want sex. For a long time I just lived with it, assuming it was just going to stay that way because I needed to prioritize my mental health. Until I decided that I deserved better for myself, it wasn’t going to change. Yes, my husband was suffering from the lack of sex, but even he thought my stability was more important than his needs. 

My guess is that your medication plays a large factor in physical desire, which sometimes will defeat your desire to want something. My body betrayed me constantly when I tried to give my husband the attention I felt he deserved. I talked through it with my doctor and made the effort to find other medication options that might continue treating my mental health without the physical barriers to libido. It made a world of difference. 

While his needs were the catalyst for my taking action, I needed to realize I deserved to feel good too before I was able to invest in the work to change. My attitude and my will are stronger now, because my motivation is to prioritize all of the things I want and finally believe I deserve. By extension, my husband benefits because my natural desire has improved.

I encourage you to talk to your doc about your options and if you are in therapy, focus your work on self improvement; on your desires to improve your self worth. 

Best of luck to you going forward. Your husband needs to be your advocate if it’s going to work. Otherwise you’re going to continue to work against yourself to bend over backwards for him.

introvert,fdbmtsd,t3_ekcz7t,1578258953.0,"My husband and I are both introverts, but he’s a lot better with the social aspect of things when necessary. I know he is willing to step up and put himself out there so I don’t have to. He insulates me from a lot of attention, and then later will isolate himself from everything until he’s recovered. 

In social situations I think introverts often draw more attention to themselves when they want to sit apart from the chaos. Extroverts tends to want to include everyone and make them all feel welcome, so it’s been my experience that when I’m off in a quiet corner because I am overwhelmed, inevitably people will come check on me and try to engage me in small talk and pull me back into the fray. 

This is my nightmare.

It’s why I avoid most events or parties. Once I’m overstimulated, I shut down completely."
DeadBedrooms,fd4tfs1,t3_ejwikg,1578170916.0,"It sounds like she’s prone to hysterical bonding and that you have let it hold you hostage because you feel bad for hurting her. But if you are unhappy, that’s not going to help either of you. Deciding to leave doesn’t necessarily mean you stop loving each other, but you will be hurting more in the long run if you’re afraid to do the hard thing now. I understand the hesitation.. it’s not a decision to take lightly. But it’s one you have to make for yourself."
