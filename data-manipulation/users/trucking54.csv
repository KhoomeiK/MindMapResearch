Conservative,ffawgdy,t1_ffandgi,1579746081.0,The will of the people means nothing to them because it isn’t what they want.
Conservative,ffavibo,t3_esglaa,1579745456.0,They remind me of the dentist who dresses the part and rides his Harley on the weekend.
detroitlions,ffav1wx,t3_esd58f,1579745155.0,I saw enough this year to think we need to go defense with the first pick. And maybe every pick.
dogs,ffatzqn,t1_ffako8b,1579744449.0,Thank you. I appreciate the advice. I will be looking closely at this.
dogs,ffakfv7,t1_ff9cglq,1579737957.0,Thanks. I’m getting educated about dog foods here and plan to look much deeper in to what we are feeding them. My vet sells Purina Pro Plan and I know a few people who use that. Is that one of the better choices out there? There doesn’t seem to be anywhere that specific brands are recommended except the sources you might not be able to trust.
dogs,ff98zr5,t1_ff7k8ug,1579707606.0,Potatoes are bad for dogs? I didn’t know that.
dogs,ff98u0e,t1_ff6lqrm,1579707505.0,"I did some research to decide what to feed our new puppy. Can’t remember the source but foods were rated from 1 to 5 stars. We started her on Wellness but as it got more expensive we switched to Fromm. It was rated 4 stars compared to Iams, Science Diet and the usual grocery store brands that rated 1 star. Our local pet supply store says it is a big seller and a couple employees feed their dogs Fromm. I had no reason to believe it isn’t a quality food but I’ll look deeper in to it for my peace of mind."
dogs,ff6ksuj,t3_erx4mf,1579629326.0,We feed our dogs Fromm. Highly rated food that has never had a recall. Not cheap but not real expensive either.
Conservative,ff6gwz8,t1_ff5z771,1579626950.0,That’s because everyone knows a .308 or 7mm-08 can’t kill people. Liberals aren’t that stupid.
Dogtraining,ff1yjmb,t3_er63do,1579489137.0,I’m betting that it’s an issue with marking territory. One does it and then the other does it. We had two small breed dogs that were house trained but we left a pee pad down just in case when we were both gone. Even if we weren’t gone long both of them would often pee on the pad. Both females if that matters. When our oldest one died the other one never used the pad again. If you only had one dog it’s possible you wouldn’t have the problem. That may not be much help to you though.
aww,feza32v,t3_eqyhe4,1579455218.0,Look at those eyes. She looks very intelligent.
Dogtraining,fez7h00,t3_eqyk4a,1579454474.0,They don’t call Havanese the Velcro dog for no reason.
49ers,fewm0wv,t3_eqi7b7,1579414177.0,Too many Packer fans wear their long underwear on the outside.
Dogtraining,fewlhk0,t1_fevai54,1579413626.0,I heard a vet on a radio show talking about adding things to food that makes poop taste bad. He said nothing works because how do you make shit taste bad. It’s already bad.
Conservative,feip07z,t3_ep9uot,1579143664.0,What a complete asshole. Someone should put a gun to his head and dare him to take it.
Conservative,fei8dva,t1_feh91un,1579132568.0,We were long overdue for a mild winter. It does happen every so often. I don’t deny the climate is changing but I question how much mans actions are contributing to it. Liberals in the US would kill our economy to do next to nothing about the climate.
Conservative,feh1l7y,t3_ep3o7r,1579107237.0,We are having an unusually warm winter here in northern Michigan. That could change but so far I love this climate change thing.
aww,fe6gz7g,t3_enw2yt,1578890601.0,Perfect choice.
LosAngelesRams,fe6gwe5,t3_eny02k,1578890532.0,I have a hard time seeing Green Bay beating SF. We saw what happened last time. Rodgers will be running for his life.
detroitlions,fe5ojpv,t3_enndzz,1578872219.0,I want GB to win so they have to go back to SF and get stomped again. It’s all I have left to live for this year.
dogs,fdxm0ob,t1_fdx1c1q,1578770455.0,I got him a nylabone that looks like a chunk of wood. It’s supposed to have some type of real wood on the surface and he loves to chew on it. He also has what looks like a piece of deer antler but I think it’s simulated and made out of something else. I got a small one for our Shih-Tzu and she likes hers too. Sometimes they just need to get older and out of the puppy stages before they calm down and become the dog you were hoping for.
aww,fdwrwqe,t1_fdwnuso,1578761779.0,It’s great that you could take one. She looks like there is some English Setter in there.
dogs,fdwqzt3,t1_fdwg94m,1578761472.0,That’s the first thing that came to mind when I read this. High energy dog that will be a challenge. This dog will need daily runs not a casual walk on a leash.
dogs,fdwpkxp,t1_fdwcunu,1578761146.0,Our 7 month old Water Spaniel has destroyed two beds. He will still chew on other stuff besides his wide assortment of chew toys. Have you tried hard chew toys like nylabone or deer antlers? Ours gets his nuts snipped in a week and we’re hoping he calms down some. I get mixed opinions about how much neutering makes a difference.
aww,fdwnlac,t3_en8e91,1578760540.0,So she’s only 4 months old. How did she become a rescue situation so young?

Conservative,fdwiy9o,t3_en709z,1578759132.0,This anti-American bitch should be sent back to Somalia.
dogs,fdwh3lm,t3_en1v2l,1578758617.0,So sorry for your loss. Our Havanese had heart failure and died in my wife’s arms a few hours after leaving the vet.
politics,fdpc4nz,t1_fdpboin,1578624921.0,You need a one way ticket to Iran. Just hope they don’t shoot your plane down by accident.
politics,fdlzp6l,t1_fdlto5k,1578536353.0,So many can’t accept the inevitable outcome of the next election.
worldnews,fdlwf41,t3_elu9pz,1578534123.0,They knew if any Americans were killed the US response would have been brutal. They also know Obama isn’t President anymore. Just like they knew when Reagan was elected. Remember what happened then?
politics,fdlw2df,t3_elxydw,1578533885.0,Kill a terrorist and liberals will defend the terrorist. Trump will be re-elected and you can’t do a thing about it.
self,fdfpnij,t1_fdcvtci,1578367204.0,California and New York among other states give drivers licenses to illegals. That’s all the id you would need to vote. You don’t think a large number voted for Clinton in the last election? There will be more in the next election. Each one cancels the vote of a citizen that votes for a Republican. Why do you think Democrats want to let anyone and everyone in this country? You think they really care about them? It’s about votes not compassion.
aww,fdchm5l,t3_ekkfe7,1578275104.0,You’re raising a good boy. Nice job.

aww,fdc5453,t1_fdbf28j,1578267285.0,"Our puppy was like that too when we first got him. Enjoy it while it lasts, puppies ain’t easy. He’s most definitely cute though."
self,fdc4qmm,t3_ekgljp,1578267077.0,We should just send them an airplane full of cash like Obama did.
self,fdc4gt3,t1_fdc0b8x,1578266928.0,"Trump didn’t get the vote of illegal aliens, Clinton did."
dogs,fdc40c8,t3_ekh1gq,1578266666.0,Havanese were in danger after the Cuban revolution. The story goes that only about 12 came to the US. A breeding program started in the 1970’s kept the breed going. Very sweet little dogs. We lost ours 6 months ago.
AskMen,fdc3efx,t1_fdc0zuj,1578266316.0,She gets a new vehicle every three years so I actually even let the dealer do the oil changes. I do put gas in it and wash it though.
AskMen,fdau088,t3_ekf1c8,1578250140.0,I change the oil and fuel her car up.
nfl,fdatgl6,t3_ekg01n,1578249917.0,McCarthy is a great choice if you like a vanilla offense and a guy who the game passed by years ago.
self,fd50o0a,t1_fd3su2g,1578173006.0,I didn’t say it was crap but employers weren’t having a hard time filling jobs like they are now. At least that’s the case where I live.
aww,fd2upax,t1_fd2hwfl,1578151802.0,Is that a Havanese and poodle?
self,fd2tf5d,t1_fd2n4bs,1578151450.0,And there is a job for anyone who wants to work. Couldn’t say that when Obummer was President.
detroitlions,fd04vt5,t3_ejj321,1578113666.0,Lions will take Derrick Brown.
aww,fcvvalh,t1_fct7yqu,1578010902.0,I screwed that up. The you are the closest was meant for you. They are very similar to the Boykin.
aww,fcvv2dv,t3_eis5tn,1578010756.0,"You are the closest. He’s an American Water Spaniel. Bred for duck hunting, especially out of boats because they are a smaller dog. Also excellent grouse dogs which is what I got him for. Most definitely not aggressive, he’s afraid of our Shih-Tzu  if she growls at him. He was only 9 weeks in that pic, now 7 months old."
AskMen,fct4vwa,t3_eimia6,1577932945.0,You’ve seen the Total Gym ads I’m sure. They are pricey but you can get similar machines for much less. Add a good pair of running shoes and you got everything covered.
self,fct4876,t3_eioswh,1577932462.0,Just enjoy life one day at a time. Time goes faster as you get older and you can’t change that anymore than you can change the climate. Try not to worry about shit you can’t control.
detroitlions,fct3ey3,t3_eimf8b,1577931856.0,If Patricia is running this shit defense then he needs to fire himself. Or maybe do the honorable thing and fall on his pencil since he doesn’t have a sword.
confession,fct2y0w,t3_einw2a,1577931504.0,The only gun control needed is to keep guns locked up if you have kids in the home. Common fucking sense. Do not tell your father about this but talk to someone about it.
detroitlions,fcs3g7t,t3_eij8lq,1577910899.0,If we can get five starters for the front seven in the draft that might help in a few years.
nevertellmetheodds,fch2l38,t1_fcg1w3r,1577646706.0,And the best legs in show business.
detroitlions,fby6fli,t3_eevqus,1577209229.0,Just leave the offense alone and draft about 5 new starters for the defensive front seven.
