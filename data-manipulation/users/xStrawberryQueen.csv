Whenever I tell her she is acting in a way that I don't appreciate, she tells me to explain what I mean and to offer instances where she has done it. After hearing what I have to say, she tells me it's either all in my head or that she doesn't have to do this or that. I feel like whatever I say to her, she already has a planned answer to it but she plays along just to make me feel like I'm getting somewhere with her. She has said before that it's hard for people to convince her of anything once she's made up her mind. Whenever we talk, I feel like that is very apparent.

I'm not sure if that makes sense, but yeah. It's always been difficult to talk things out with her without feeling less about myself. That's why I chose to cut her out rather than communicate with her the proper way. I hope one day we can have closure, though, but for now she has blocked me on social media after I left all our chats and unfriended her lmao."
