AskReddit,ffcbs0r,t1_ffbv1k1,1579796035.0,"I can relate to this thread. 

Doing photoshop, presentations, ideas, solve problems, programming, writing and others too. I do Engineering (pretty good at most stuff since I spent learning than making friends or ""enjoying"") and most people in the uni are incompentent idiots (not one but many), they just need me to do their things for free. Even the smart ones do this. Almost like, use me until they get things done. Being nice just so I would help them. 

We made an application for a ""friend"" in exchange of future clients. We completed it, deployed it. He was like ""meh, I dont want it anymore"" that lil piece of shit.

Now I have started to be upfront and assertive (used to be passive), people started to avoid me from their usual ""nice"" to my face behavior. Most of the time it feels much better this way."
