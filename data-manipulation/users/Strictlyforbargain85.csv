Edit: Apparently Orca pods can attack Blue Whales on extremely rare occasions. It took about 50 orcas to take down one. I imagine it’s sort of like if 50 little kids attacking an adult at once.

One of Hank Hill’s greatest attributes is his undying love for his job, propane, his wife, and his son. Peggy is by no means a milf, but it never occurs to Hank to even remotely speak ill of Peggy, even in a joking fashion.  Although Bobby has interests that are polar opposite to Hank’s, he’s always very protective over Bobby’s feelings.  He likes to drink beer with his buddies, but will immediately drop it all for his work or family needs.  Hank Hill is such an incredible character."
