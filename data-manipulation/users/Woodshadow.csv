The worst date is probably my current girlfriend. We met through a mutual friend. The three of us hung out for about 6 hours. I asked her to breakfast the next morning as friends. Went well. I asked her out again as a date. Felt like it went great. She was super flirtatious, lots of touching, talked about how we are absolutely going to go to a couple other restaurants in the next couple months, and how we should absolutely go skiing together before winder is over... then at the end of the night I went in for a kiss and she pulled away and just said no thank you. Felt super awkward after that. Apparently she wasn't feeling it. Also maybe this is just me but on our friend date she paid her own way and then on our real date I paid for her. In all the dates I went on for close to the last 10 year the girl has paid or at least offered to pay her own way on the date. 


As I said she is my current girlfriend. She was a very flirty girl and we basically became quick ""friends with benefits"". I wanted more for a year and a half with her constantly telling me no a real relationship isn't going to happen. Here we are at about 8 months of actually dating and things couldn't be better. Long story short she has major commitment issues and took a year and a half to finally get her to commit. Another 6 months to finally meet her mom"

personalfinance,feg0ass,t3_eou9tp,1579071507.0,"Congrats on making your first living wage job. It gets easier from here. I get it. I got my first job making $55k last year at 28. I had friends making $80k and $90k right out of college. It does feel a little bad but $55k meant so much to me when I finally got that job. I bought a new car(this sub hates new cars but I love mine) and finally started building savings. I live on my own. I could be saving sooo much more with a roommate but I don't want one. I can afford my own health insurance(not an unexpected surgury or anything mind you) and I am finally putting 5% to my 401k.  $55k felt like I could stop looking for other jobs and just generally stop stressing about small things.


Actually for the last 6 months I have been making $70k. Everything above is what I thought when I was making $55k. The additional $15k err roughly $12k after taxes is mostly going to savings. I have no kids or anyone to support right now. I increased my 401k by 1% and started contributing more to my HSA at work. I could do more but I want to buy a house in a year or two. What I will say about $70k is when I go to a restaurant if I see something that I really want on a menu that is $2 or $3 more than something I kind of want I will buy the item I really want. I feel like I can treat myself just a little bit more. I will probably look at cheap trip somewhere.  I spent about $200 more on Christmas than I did the year before. So of that $12k I am hoping that $10k or at least $9k ends up in my bank account.

I tried to give them the same bullshit stuff and then they were like well that doesn't really feel like why you want the job. And then went on to talk about how when they got promoted it meant they could finally provide for their families and they would buy a house... like wtf no shit that is why I want the job. No one is going to say it isn't for the money.
todayilearned,fdiwihe,t1_fdiqypn,1578452631.0,He just told you his boss doesn't have a private number. You don't know he has a private number. This guy works closely enough with him that he texts the guy. I am more inclined to believe him
mildlyinteresting,fdhgiz3,t1_fdgmacf,1578422164.0,I was looking for the comment that mentions you are in the Philippines. This is the only country I have seen someone post bats being sold at Ace hardware. I guess you aren’t just reposting.
news,fdhg1d2,t1_fdhbu0g,1578421870.0,Trump literally just put the US on the brink of war. The US military was declared a terrorist organization and Iran is telling us they WILL retaliate against the US military because they are so upset not with the US but with the Trump administration. So yeah people are pissed at Trump because is just gave Iran a reason to disregard prior nuclear sanctions and to attack and kill Americans. Iran has made it very clear their issue is with Trump. Apparently there is an $80 million dollar bounty on his head now.
personalfinance,fdhd8pu,t1_fdfs3yx,1578420289.0,I thought about getting a side job doing taxes but then I realized entry level at HR block is only like $1 more than minimum wage. Idk what they do there but I am pretty sure they just enter the same numbers into the same software
personalfinance,fdhcyrw,t1_fdh2wk3,1578420155.0,Can you even file on paper any more? I am confused by your opposition to using software. That is all I have known for the last 10 years. Log into TurboTax and follow the instructions. Done in like 30 minutes.
news,fdhc401,t1_fdgd6om,1578419732.0,In America I probably get hit with one a month driving along on the freeway. People just toss them out their windows driving.
news,fdfrw9d,t1_fdeboy4,1578368692.0,Seriously what a fucking joke. He is playing to the lowest common denominator. I don't know what rich people's walkers look like but I am one hundred percent sure they don't have tennis balls on the ends of them.
AskReddit,fdfrhwo,t3_el2az5,1578368427.0,Been watching mythbusters. Does that make it a orgy? I am not sure that i could do it with Adam or Jamie. If I could pick Kari I could probably do it.
AskReddit,fdd2xmc,t1_fdcques,1578292629.0,I had a former boss who I think was doing alright with it. She said she made $20k from it one year but she was working pretty hard for that. I don't know if she is still doing it or not. She was one of those roped in by the retired millionaires down the block who were her mentors. Last I knew she was working some other shitty sales job and doing that on the side
AskReddit,fdd2nmc,t1_fdctskg,1578292327.0,Yeah I thought I wanted to do that for a bit even after they every single company said make a list of 100 people you could sell to and I knew that was telling me that it was a mistake.  I had friends in the past who at one time or another thought I would like to hang out with after college but then they tried to sell me insurance or better yet get me involved in their financial planning(dude we both graduated with debt and I make $40k with no assets I have no money to invest)
AskReddit,fdd2id0,t1_fdcmful,1578292167.0,"> She told me she quit when she realized she approached every new acquaintance with an aim to make a sale instead of making a friend.

My girlfriend doesn't have a lot of friends and met a couple of really cool people who seemed like they had the same quirky interests. She asked them to hang out they didn't ask her. And all of them tried to sell her on their MLM in their first hang out. She tried hanging out with them again at a later date and all they would do is talk about how great their opportunities were"
AdviceAnimals,fdd2dra,t1_fdcsu6s,1578292026.0,it varies by state and locality. where i live minimum wage for tipped employees is the same for tipped and nontipped employees. I think it is time we move past tipping and start paying a normal wage. waiters should make more than $15k a year but IMO they shouldn't make $90k
AdviceAnimals,fdd28st,t1_fdcmeyt,1578291875.0,I live where minimum wage is $15 an hour. Not sure if that is living wage or not. I know servers making anywhere between $45k and $90k a year after tips. Really depends where you work. But $45k isn't much to scoff at. A degree and a couple years of experience doesn't earn you that in a lot of fields
leagueoflegends,fdcpv4b,t3_ekh445,1578281042.0,let people try out skins in custom games or something like HoTS has
worldnews,fdcp52r,t1_fdbcna8,1578280506.0,Same. I am reading this title as make sure you kill the people who signed up to be killed not the ones who didn't. It feels like some sort of sick lottery.
