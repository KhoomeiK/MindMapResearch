csMajors,felnvfo,t3_epqbj4,1579226661.0,I heard back from Boston's Data Science (last week) and User Research (today) positions.
venturecapital,fel6n2l,t3_epnfsu,1579215191.0,"Hey, I'm currently a junior in college and this summer I'll be interning at a VC firm. I landed this VC internship after applying on LinkedIn, so just keep applying and don't give up. However, most VC firms don't hire summer interns, or they only hire from a pre-selected group (such as a group of colleges or from specific programs, etc.) Some VC firms will have private application links that they only send out to certain mailing lists, so it's impossible to even apply.

And while VCs are selective when it comes to internships, they're usually pretty open to getting help scouting companies. Being in college is a huge advantage here because we're within close proximity to what Gen Z'ers are up to these days, which VCs are definitely curious about. So even if you can't land a summer internship, keep an eye out for term-time scouting opportunities, since that'll really help you make connections.

Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. Happy to help if I can."

I also think cinema and streaming work well in tandem. Most movies are first shown in theaters, then on streaming platforms. If that were to change: say, it's shown in theaters and on streaming platforms at the same time, then we might have an issue. But I don't see that changing for many years, given the natural rise of streaming platforms."
