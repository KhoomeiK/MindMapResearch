cats,fde1fd2,t3_ekwgkh,1578329011.0,Keep Molly; tell everybody it's short for Molybdenum - one of the very important heavy metals that makes so much of modern life possible. Get extra geek points rating off chemistry and metallurgical data about it. Trust me  - no one will check.

cats,fckts6m,t3_ehqe6h,1577733021.0,We use small dog velcro harnesses on our 14# cats. Those work pretty well for us.

CrazyIdeas,fciwgbe,t3_ehcwn9,1577671456.0,"Done by a teenager, actually. I forget the kids name, but he invented a prototype harvester, got funding and backers, and is currently scaling up. Joe Rogan had him on his podcast recently. Current trial models are filling shipping containers with recovered plastics. 

They also did a survey of rivers and streams and identified the five largest sources for plastics headed into the oceans and are working to establish the same automated recovery systems on those source waterways. Very cool stuff."
CrazyIdeas,fcivuvi,t1_fciuhpu,1577671047.0,"You mean like all the water towers that we've had in existence for the last several hundred years? Holding water long term is OLD technology. The Romans did it with rocks and plaster. And heavy is good; that makes it a compact, dense storage medium. And no, it doesn't penetrate things easily. Easily done with current tech, safe for storage, and environmentally friendly."
CrazyIdeas,fciu5rk,t1_fcitsiq,1577669882.0,"How many resources does it take once it's up there? A closed valve is rather static.  The innovation would come more on the pump and turbine efficiencies, maybe reducing fluid friction in the piping. But no issues with a ninja like gas that will level your building when it escapes containment."
CrazyIdeas,fcitqy2,t3_ehcwn9,1577669604.0,It's currently being done by at least one startup.
CrazyIdeas,fcitg5z,t3_eh9ff7,1577669399.0,"Simpler method, just use the extra energy to pump water into an elevated holding tank. When you need the power let it run back down spinning a turbine generator. Scale up our down ad appropriate."
