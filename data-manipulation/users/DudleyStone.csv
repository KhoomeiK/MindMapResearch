So yes, seriously. My post also said ""what they're used for"" which you ignored, and you clearly didn't know the original intention of the show. I never said it couldn't share technology but just repeating usage of it like in past episodes isn't fresh.

Every episode from Season 1 to Season 3 (including the *White Christmas* special) primarily introduced new technological aspects, or if they shared something with the past/present, they were usually done to extreme ends so no two episodes were even in the same ballpark.

* *Ashley Too* reused the ""cookies"" which was introduced all the way back in *White Christmas* (between Seasons 2 and 3), focusing on it as a way to trapping people's minds or other versions of themselves. It was already reused in *USS Callister* and *Black Museum* from Season 4."

Atlanta isn't using a model for this. The only reason Atlanta is doing this is because of the cast's careers. If Donald Glover et al didn't have anything else to do, we probably would've had another season already and I would bet it would've been pretty good.

You don't need a model of super long delays to make things better. You just need to avoid being excessive.

Your examples of bad showrunning is primarily talking about shows that have a crazy number of episodes per season to where things are overworked and get very flawed.

And you can't compare Atlanta to stuff like Seinfeld because Atlanta isn't trying to do 24 episodes per season.

It's completely normal for a show to have 8 to 12 episodes per season, with each season coming out approximately every year, and end after a few seasons. Go look at examples like Breaking Bad.

The main problem in Western media is instead the producers adding too many episodes or having the show go for too many seasons."

patientgamers,fdhuh23,t3_elc0f5,1578430365.0,"Yeah, that's part of the reason I have not gotten into roguelikes/roguelites. My interest gets killed by repetition to me.

If someone is really strong at it, they can enjoy it a lot. Or if they have all the time in the world and don't get tired of redoing the same areas.

But for me, running through nearly identical areas over and over bores me out of games like that. It happened with *Enter the Gungeon* where I never got past the 3rd floor. It happened with *Dead Cells* where I found 1-cell runs too hard but also got tired of the RNG-related ""exploration"" (i.e., having to traverse a few areas, grab an item, restart from the beginning to traverse some of the same areas again just to find a new path, etc.). And there's a handful of others I gave up on.

So permadeath (or even altered permadeath as in roguelites) ends up boring me out. Especially if I have to repeat multiple sections I find easy only to keep dying on the same difficult area again and again.

I'm also just not a fan of games relying upon RNG either, though, which is another huge aspect of roguelites."
books,fd3o4mm,t3_ejwden,1578160192.0,"Yes, because of time, work, and also getting older.

Work and other responsibilities made life become a schedule with less freedom. I still read, but nowhere near as much as I used to.

Being younger and having less responsibilities, I had the freedom to play games, watch stuff, read stuff, go hang out with people, and do a lot of other things during just a few days.

That changed when older, when there's little between getting home, doing the usual routines, and then getting tired. Half of the time I'll be mentally exhausted from work so it's much easier to turn on something to watch or even play a video game (unless it's puzzle-related/confusing) than it is to focus on a book."
Vampireweekend,fd1552h,t3_ejmnmf,1578127592.0,"I agree with quite a lot of this (not gonna argue over best songs).

I can definitely agree on *Father of the Bride*. I like every song on the first 2 albums and only a couple of iffy ones on the 3rd for me.

But between 1/3 to 1/2 of FOTB I don't care for. I only really listen to maybe 1/2 of FOTB, and the rest I don't return to much. I don't enjoy it as an album and just end up picking the songs here and there when I want to hear them.

Now, one of the places I differ from you (and many fans) is *Hannah Hunt*. The song just doesn't do anything for me. The chorus is nice to hear but it just... doesn't get to me. And if I remember correctly Ezra was iffy on it too, but said he was happily surprised to see a large amount of the fan base take to it.

Also, thanks for the shout-out for *I Think Ur a Contra*. I love that song but feel like I've never seen it mentioned! Now that I think about it, I think all of their album closers get overlooked/forgotten (including *Hudson* which is just before the official closer)."

There's lots of other news in the US. The bigger problem with media in the US is that it'll focus on dumber things just for ratings.

But there's still quite a lot of ways to learn info here. Just the average citizen is too lazy to research anything or they pick some political stance and never budge, without truly caring what the respective politicians do.
