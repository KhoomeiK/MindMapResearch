nba,ff28c3d,t1_ff23an0,1579496751.0,"I agree. It is why I mostly don't comment in there. So far Pop sucks, LMA suck, DeRozan should be traded for a second round pick... The only people who cannot do anything wrong are DJM and Walker both of which have shown to have serious  problems but the sub won't admit it. They've even glorified failed dunks *sigh*"

aww,fel8fl8,t1_fel45ov,1579216313.0,"Keep doing that. Consistently, then rotate or move the plate so that you start facing him, then start sliding the plate so he has to go next to your legs... closer and closer so you can get to your arm. Then you can extend your arm as if to pet, then gently pet the top of head etc.. always make sure he is comfortable with a step before you move to the next step. 

Spend some time just reading, youtube watching whatever near him while ignoring him. He does need to learn about household noises and to get comfortable with you just existing. 

Get a very long wand toy, play some with him from a large distance, then of course over time shorten the distance.

find some soft toys he likes to play, rub them over you so that they smell like you. That way when he plays witht hem he learns your scent and trusts you more."

NBASpurs,fe65r60,t3_encbdb,1578882406.0,I know you are using the la lotteria pictures but is there a way to edit them to be less high? Right now they take an awful lot of height and not enough width...
NBASpurs,fe65jof,t1_fe2szf9,1578882271.0,I also miss the link to r/nba. I also second the basketball idea of u/Kanibe .. i wouldn't mind a basketball hoop left of the Spurs logo ...

Boston did its part. Time for the NBA itself to step in."
InteriorDesign,fdzyhsl,t3_emmsrf,1578798892.0,"1. How are you going to open the fridge? It is terrible when it is only furniture, and once people are in, it would be worse. The oven placement is also not working... you will shove guests out of the way and btw be carrying hot dishes right over them?
2. Why is the table on top of the couch. There is no way anyone is sitting there comfortably. 
3. Why is there a couch? Couches are not the same height as dining room chairs. 
4. Why is there wood and warm tile floor on one side and cold cool metallic/glossy stuff for the rest?
5. Why shove the person going to the fridge all the way through the whole space? Why shove the person doing the dishes at an awkward angle without even giving them a corner sink?
6. No dishwasher would make me very sad. 
7. Why is the dining area shoved to one side? 
8. Why is the oven right next to the fridge so that people who need to do two different things would be on top. Also ugh at having a heat producing oven next to a coldness producing fridge. 
9. Is there a dishwasher?"
InteriorDesign,fdzxh4c,t3_emd4wx,1578798181.0,"I dislike the fridge far from the pantry, so layout 1 and 3 are the only ones that make sense to me. However, if it were up to me, i'd put the stove on the island... this way i'd feel more integrated with company in the other public spaces."
science,fdt9f8v,t1_fdsjl7f,1578713645.0,"Nope. That is bulshit. I am giving the power for someone to decide who has the basic capability to safely posses a gun. 

It is not that fucking hard to get a gun safe. Gun owners who do not own and use one have no business owning a gun."
science,fdsdsty,t1_fds95ci,1578700368.0,Really? How is that hard?
science,fds6zx1,t1_fdrjxiq,1578695772.0,"> they are not and were not opposed to securing their firearms, but rather lacked the means or education to do so

How about if you do not have the means or education to secure a firearm, you are not allowed to own one until you do?"
mildlyinteresting,fds4itg,t1_fdryll7,1578694178.0,I know all of this. It doesn't change the fact the solution from OP's picture is way simpler and elegant.
NBASpurs,fdr96fi,t1_fdqlvh3,1578681156.0,I didn;t see it originally either but I know it is a fail and can't sit here and pretend he did not.

UpliftingNews,fdpq3xb,t1_fdpp9hy,1578636268.0,">Just feed the little shits. I don't personally like kids, but they shouldn't go hungry.


So you are volunteering to pay? If you do so let me know and I'd personally call every school in my state so they can send you the bill.

SOMEONE has to pay for the food.

>Also, afaik, my lunch wasn't personally subsidized. Everyone paid the same for the base meal.

Then it was. It was just that the subsidy was spead over everyone instead of trying to determine need..."
UpliftingNews,fdpp0by,t1_fdpods6,1578635165.0,"Well that if nothing else makes it 20 bucks. Assuming your lunch was not subsidized.

I know you love the narrative about evil corporations but the reality is that a great chunk of these school lunches debts are to a small extent due to parents refusing to sign their kids for free lunch and to a much larger extent due to parents who don't give a shit about paying the school lunch bill even though they have the money.

What we need is for the schools to be able to garnish the parents' wages so that they are not stuck with large unpaid bills due to shitty parents.

It is not the job of schools to feed your kid.... It is the job of the parent. But it is so much less popular to call out the shitty parents..."
