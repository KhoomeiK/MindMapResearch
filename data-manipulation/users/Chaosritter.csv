This means of survival for desperate women, and sometimes men, became normalized to a degree in the 1920s. During the war, venereal diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea spread at a rate that warranted government attention.[40] Soldiers at the front contracted these diseases from prostitutes, so the German army responded by granting approval to certain brothels that were inspected by their own medical doctors, and soldiers were rationed coupon books for sexual services at these establishments.[41] Homosexual behaviour was also documented among soldiers at the front. Soldiers returning to Berlin at the end of the War had a different attitude towards their own sexual behaviour than they had a few years previously.[41] Prostitution was frowned on by respectable Berliners, but it continued to the point of becoming entrenched in the city's underground economy and culture. First women with no other means of support turned to the trade, then youths of both genders.

>Crime in general developed in parallel with prostitution in the city, beginning as petty thefts and other crimes linked to the need to survive in the war's aftermath. Berlin eventually acquired a reputation as a hub of drug dealing (cocaine, heroin, tranquilizers) and the black market. The police identified 62 organized criminal gangs in Berlin, called Ringvereine.[42] The German public also became fascinated with reports of homicides, especially ""lust murders"" or Lustmord. Publishers met this demand with inexpensive criminal novels called Krimi, which like the film noir of the era (such as the classic M), explored methods of scientific detection and psychosexual analysis.[43]

>Apart from the new tolerance for behaviour that was technically still illegal, and viewed by a large part of society as immoral, there were other developments in Berlin culture that shocked many visitors to the city. Thrill-seekers came to the city in search of adventure, and booksellers sold many editions of guide books to Berlin's erotic night entertainment venues. There were an estimated 500 such establishments, that included a large number of homosexual venues for men and for women; sometimes transvestites of one or both genders were admitted, otherwise there were at least 5 known establishments that were exclusively for a transvestite clientele.[44] There were also several nudist venues. Berlin also had a museum of sexuality during the Weimar period, at Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld's Institute of Sexology.[45] These were nearly all closed when the Nazi regime became a dictatorship in 1933.

>Artists in Berlin became fused with the city's underground culture as the borders between cabaret and legitimate theatre blurred. Anita Berber, a dancer and actress, became notorious throughout the city and beyond for her erotic performances (as well as her cocaine addiction and erratic behaviour). She was painted by Otto Dix, and socialized in the same circles as Klaus Mann.

Again: her husband was a frequent ""guest"" at his sex parties and he gave money to her foundation. I'd say she'd lose quite a bit if it turned out she knew her husband was a raping underage sex slaves at the parties of one of her fiancers on a regular basis and did nothing.

She's about as credible as the Kavanaugh accusers that claimed he assaulted them decades ago with no evidence and either admitted they lied or quietly dropped the case once they could no longer prevent his inauguration.

>This delusional shite about people being ""suicided"" by the Clintons is far-right propaganda. You are showing clear signs of swallowing whole sections of their lies, hook, line and sinker.

So...

Thinking that the Clinton's *might* have something to do with their less powerful enemies dying left and right is ""delusional far-right propaganda"", but insisting that if Epstein didn't kill himself it must have been Trump is perfectly reasonable?

You mean aside from her being a public figure with lots going on, her husband being a known sex offender that has been on the ""Lolita Express"" dozens of times and accepting large donations for her foundation?

>Trump, sitting in the highest seat in the land, his cronies shitting up everything in sight with blatant corruption and an eye for sabotage to the norms of office. Trump with his longstanding close relationship with Epstein, including multiple allegations of rape and sexual abuse, including against children. Both means and motive.

Oh yeah, and because he's so deep in there, he was the only one who was actually [willing to cooperate with the prosecution](https://100percentfedup.com/video-president-trump-was-the-only-one-who-helped-prosecutor-in-epstein-case/) in the 2009 lawsuit, right? 

He happened to be seen on one of Epsteins parties *in 1992* that took place in a hotel he owns and hasn't had any interaction with underage girls there, that means he's guilty, *right*?

>Yet somehow you think it's Clinton that's to blame. The delusion.

I didn't say the Clinton's ended him, you made this about Trump and I said they have a much stronger motive. And people that could expose them tend to turn suicidal quite frequently."

HA HA HA HA HA!

Yeah, okay.

People that pose a threat to the Clintons spontanously commit suicide left and right (occasionally with a bag over their head, holding notes saying that they had nothing to do with it), but if there's anyone that could possibly could have had an interest in the famous pedophile with links to democrat politicians, businessmen and Hollywood elites and a massive painting of Bill Clinton in a dress being assassinated before he can talk, it must have been Trump.
