weddingplanning,fg58mvd,t3_ewujpg,1580521040.0,"Are you wearing a veil? I think a long veil would be very beautiful with this dress, maybe with little silver jewels embedded?"
oilpen,fg55fcj,t1_fg55dpv,1580518715.0,"Thank you, I never thought about that!"
oilpen,fg54v2m,t1_fg54sl7,1580518320.0,"They’re definitely fake, this I know. I just know they don’t have any dangerous ingredients, just unfortunately a lower thc promise :/"
weddingplanning,fg54qds,t1_fg52b84,1580518225.0,"That’s a great idea omg! If I knew we weren’t heading straight for an apartment, I sooo would do the same. I love a good hot tub."
oilpen,fg54o1i,t1_fg54htx,1580518179.0,Thanks for the concern :) I’ve been with a trusted dealer for a long time now and so far (lol) nothing has killed me. Can’t wait for IN to be legal like it’s surrounding states

weddingplanning,fg50ssk,t1_fg50oka,1580515504.0,"Oh definitely. We are so excited to be as one, and to share memories together and be together always. We love to travel as well so hoping to revel in that for a while too :)"
weddingplanning,fg4x7bg,t1_fg4x3m7,1580513116.0,"Thanks for that insight! My FH and I are just really excited but you’re right, it might not happen right away and then we’d have baby stuff but no baby."
weddingplanning,fg4wuaw,t1_fg4wolt,1580512878.0,"This is something I really am trying to focus on, some expensive home appliances like coffee machines and deep fryers, but on the other hand, small, $12 gardening sets and varying gift cards."
weddingplanning,fg4wpgx,t1_fg4wjhu,1580512791.0,"board games and camping gear is a great idea!! I also thought about video game chairs because we game a lot, but again didn’t know if that’s be appropriate? Everyone who knows me knows I’m ready for a family which is why I even questioned the baby stuff, but now that I think about it I want to wait and do a separate registry."
weed,fg4qmec,t1_fg4qjft,1580508940.0,Agreed! It’s not fair that some people gamble the ingredients in their carts just because they don’t live in a legal area. Scary.
weed,fg4qb0o,t1_fg4q54g,1580508738.0,They’re all full gram btw.. our plug is pretty tight with my boyfriend so we get pretty good deals on in thankfully. In the future we wanna try our hand on making it ourselves we just still live with our folks so we kind of have to sneak around.
