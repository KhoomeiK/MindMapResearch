ShouldIbuythisgame,ffpeeaj,t3_eu7ftr,1580092968.0,"Hollow Knight is my favorite platformer of all time and pretty much nails every point you mentioned: strong story, character progression, ""towns"", NPCs, and one of the coolest worlds/maps I've ever had the pleasure of exploring. The combat is tough but fair, and oh so satisfying to master. I really can't recommend this game enough.

I also really enjoyed Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight, which is a relatively short but utterly charming game with light RPG elements and character progression/customization. It was the first game I played after Hollow Knight that actually managed to win me over, which is saying something.

Also, and this may be a long shot, Sundered: Eldritch Edition is a platformer/Metroidvania that could be considered RPG-like in the sense that you spend shards to level up skills/traits and acquire new abilities, and your combat/traversal moveset is defined by decisions you're asked to make following each boss fight. The platforming isn't overly difficult, but it's definitely there, and the combat is fun without being too terribly challenging or complex. I wasn't really expecting much from this game so it honestly ended up blowing me away how much I loved it--which was enough to immediately start another playthrough so I could experiment with making different choices the second time around."
NintendoSwitch,ffp58l9,t3_eu1lv4,1580086513.0,"You and I definitely share an appreciation for this genre, so hopefully I can offer a few recommendations and opinions you'll find helpful.

Children of Morta is SO GOOD. I'm honestly excited for you to start playing. :) I was excited about the game and figured I would enjoy it, but I *really* enjoyed it. One of my favorites I've played in the past few years, actually, for a few reasons.

Dead Cells is definitely a game purchase to prioritize because it's by far one of my favorite rogue-like/lites and a true joy to play. I found it challenging but achievable in a way Enter the Gungeon simply isn't. Meaning, I was able to defeat the final boss at least once (which leads to a more difficult second playthrough with modifiers, and so on). The controls are super responsive and the combat feels great. For sure pick this up as soon as you can.

Disclaimer: Just so you know where my tastes lie, I really loved Enter the Gungeon for a while but it hasn't stuck with me like games such as Binding of Isaac or Slay the Spire because I found it too difficult to make meaningful progress beyond a certain point. Slay the Spire is my GOTY for 2019 and an absolute obsession. I double-dipped and bought it on both Steam and Switch because I love it so very much and find it infinitely replayable in a way very few games can match. Binding of Isaac is a weird game because I hated it the first time I played it, thought it was just okay the second time, then after that something clicked and I ended up pouring over a hundred hours into the game on three separate consoles (Vita, PS4, and Switch...I also own it for 3DS). The aesthetic is disgusting, but the randomness and synergies keep me coming back again and again...making it my second most-played rogue-like/lite after Slay the Spire.

While it's more of a Metroidvania than a roguelike, I wonder if you might enjoy Sundered: Eldritch Edition as much as I did. You explore a big, semi-procedurally generated map (with defined regions/areas) while leveling up your character by spending shards you accumulate from ""run"" to ""run"" and augmenting his moveset based on decisions you're asked to make. This hooked me for a similar reason as most roguelikes...the feeling of throwing myself at a challenge again and again by way of making incremental progress. As I said, this leans more toward Metroidvania than roguelike, but given our similar tastes, I do think you might click with the overall gameplay loop.

Death Road to Canada is a bit of a unique roguelike that mixes a text-based adventure with brief (and simple) combat/looting missions. My favorite thing about this game is that it lets you create custom characters and name them after friends/family/co-workers/enemies...which leads to some pretty amusing scenarios. Not as action-oriented as most of your other examples, but still a very fun and replayable indie roguelike (of a sort).

Nuclear Throne is another decent/good roguelike that managed to suck me in for quite a few hours before I eventually moved on to other things. Personally, I'd rank the difficulty as closer to Enter the Gungeon than something like Dead Cells or even Slay the Spire--I've reached the end of the latter two more than once, while EtG and Nuclear Throne have been harder for me to master. Still, I very much enjoy the feeling of Nuclear Throne and plan to revisit it more in the future. Maybe I'll even reach the nuclear throne someday.

Kingdom: New Lands and Kingdom: Two Crowns are fun, slightly obtuse tower-defense roguelike/lite games with a unique art style and simple but addictive gameplay. I haven't necessarily gotten very far with either of them, but I also haven't put in all that much time with either one. I am very glad to have them on my Switch, though, and have no problem recommending these games to others.

Rogue Legacy is one of my very favorite roguelikes on Switch, and the only game I've ever played deep into New Game++. It is a platformer, though, so I'm not sure if you'll enjoy it as much as I did. The game has a good sense of humor and each run feels reasonably distinct...there's a definite and very satisfying progression that persists between runs and eventually makes your character stronger, tougher, and more likely to go farther on the next run. It's tremendously satisfying to start out relatively weak/defenseless and grind yourself to competence. Bonus points for the kick-ass music, which I loved.

Don't Starve is pretty cute and I've put more time into it than I care to admit, but survival games aren't my favorite and I never seem to get very far. Still, if it ever goes on sale this one is honestly worth a look. There's something about it I actually really enjoy...in small doses.

While not nearly as well designed or addictive as Slay the Spire, Frost is a decent but somewhat obtuse card game that seems to go on sale for less than $5 on a fairly regular basis. I'm glad I didn't pay full price, but if you can pick this up cheap it's not a bad way to pass the time.

NintendoSwitch,ffnj8qa,t3_eu5evb,1580066653.0,"I'm gonna go with no, unless you feel strongly about supporting the developer.

I've completed my fair share of reasonably challenging games such as Bloodborne, Dark Souls III, and Hollow Knight (including the White Palace, but not the Path of Pain), but Cuphead ended up being too much for me to keep banging my head against. I literally beat one boss. Granted, I didn't dedicate hours to perfecting my technique and taking down the others (whereas I did invest multiple hours getting through the very first section of Bloodborne), so it's entirely possible that I could go farther with some serious practice. For whatever reason, I didn't feel as compelled to keep trying with Cuphead like I did with the other titles I mentioned. It looks amazing, but the gameplay is too twitchy for me to have much confidence that I'll eventually master the timing and controls.

I'm not saying I'll never try again, but my first few attempts were most definitely more frustrating than fun."

NintendoSwitch,ffk2d76,t1_ffjxiho,1580013673.0,"Dragon Quest XI is definitely a fantastic choice. A big, sprawling epic with a Nintendo-esque level of polish that won't present much of a challenge and is basically the equivalent of JRPG comfort food. I'm about 21 hours in and am enjoying it thoroughly.

If you aren't intimidated by a more obtuse combat system and layers upon layers of menus/interfaces/content to navigate through, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is also a fantastic, epic JRPG. I enjoyed it so much more than I thought I would. The world design is gorgeous and while some characters are kind of annoying, the story frankly blew me away. I seriously never expected XC2 to win me over like it did (though to be fair, it did take longer than usual for me to get hooked and fall in love--maybe 10-15 hours).

My last suggestion is Hollow Knight. It costs $15 and is one of my top three video games of all time. I've played through the whole game twice and am waiting very anxiously for the sequel Silksong. Hollow Knight's world map is a masterclass of design and the combat/movement feels incredibly responsive and oh so good. If you have any interest in 2D platformers and/or Metroidvanias, do yourself a favor and check it out."
relationships,ffjcgmo,t1_ffjapiz,1579995380.0,"Not everyone showers daily. Doing so can cause a lot of skin problems, or even immune problems, which is why it's hardly uncommon for people (who don't have physically strenuous or dirty jobs) to only shower every other day. I do think that if you're coming home from work with a distinct job-related odor, you should probably shower daily, or at the very least no more than every other day, but the idea that it's unacceptable to go a day without showering really does come from a place of immense privilege (you'd waste 50% less water by moving to an every other day schedule) and ignorance (about what's truly optimal for human health and hygiene)."

Of course some people do it well, but given that most people aren't qualified teachers and probably not super-geniuses themselves, I think it's safe to assume that lots of and lots of parents don't.

Dragon Quest XI is also an excellent game. I'm currently 17 hours into my first playthrough and am absolutely loving it.

This is why YTA. As an adult--a *father*\--you're not supposed to deal with childish behavior by behaving like a child yourself. But you did. You ignored the fact that your daughter was upset and in pain, and rather than deal with the emotional fallout like a grown-up, you decided to validate your daughter's feelings about you by proving you didn't give a shit about her. Why are you surprised she's so angry and disrespectful now?"
AmItheAsshole,fdhpkvu,t1_fdgbt2b,1578427627.0,Because disowning a child should only be reserved for extremely serious offenses and not taken lightly. No sane/decent parent resorts to cutting off contact with their kid unless their literal health and safety depends on it.

Your father made one mistake, years ago, for which he has repeatedly apologized. Before this mistake--which had much more to do with your mother than his relationship with you--the two of you were extremely close. All it takes is *one mistake* for you to write somebody off for life? I sincerely hope your fiance never hurts your feelings because I assume it'll be divorce time, no hesitation, as you've apparently never learned to let go and forgive.

It does suck that you weren't invited to your dad's wedding, but again, that really had nothing to do with you and apparently everything to do with the fear of upsetting your mom. Your father could literally die tomorrow and you're willing to let this one action poison your relationship with him forever?

You need therapy. Not only to mend your relationship with your father, but to learn the skills you'll need to deal with a husband and potentially even children who will one day screw up and hurt you. Humans are far from perfect and sometimes they disappoint us. Holding onto your anger despite sincere apologies and attempts at atonement won't erase or make you feel better about what happened. I mean it's been years at this point. Why not try to adopt a new mindset, if only for your own mental health?"

What you have isn't a mother-in-law problem, it's a husband problem. You are 100% not the asshole for setting boundaries like a healthy adult. If your husband is being driven to *tears* by this woman, it's your duty as a mother to protect your own child from her viciousness."

I don't normally agree that people can claim ""dibs"" on a baby name, but this was a hugely insensitive decision you and your husband made. Of course they haven't reached out to you. They're in mourning. You just named your healthy child the same name as their dead baby. Why would they want to rub salt in this very fresh, extraordinarily severe wound by going to meet a perfect baby girl who's nearly the exact same age and has the same name as the daughter they literally just lost?

It sucks to lose out on a name you loved for your own kid, but you had to realize what this would do to your SIL and BIL. You had to understand that anyone who cared about BIL and SIL would find your decision insensitive and atrocious. You chose to move ahead anyway, so now you get to face the consequences."

You have an obligation to your wife and children first, and allowing an angry, lazy misogynist to move in wouldn't be fair to any of them. Anyone who chooses not to work/support themselves simply because they ""don't want to"" should expect to end up homeless at some point. Why should your brother get to be a lazy bum and enjoy the same standard of living you do?

Your family not only sucks, they obviously played a huge role in creating this problem. If they think your brother deserves to be supported by relatives, they need to step up and support him."

So far it's ranking up there with Dead Cells for me. The combat may not be quite as satisfying, but the story and characters are far superior and the pixel art is every bit as gorgeous. I think this may be the most satisfying grind/progression in a rogue-like I've seen yet, mostly because story elements are incorporated in a way that it doesn't feel very repetitive at all. There are multiple characters with their own playstyles and tons of incentive for using each one. I wasn't expecting this game to suck me in so quickly, but after at least 6-8 hours of gameplay I can confirm that I'm well and truly addicted for the foreseeable future."
