If your sauce breaks on reheating and is oily then fault the cheese and use a better cheddar. I make 4 cups of bechamel with half and half and add 2lbs or so of fresh shredded cheese in handfuls melting in before adding more. Adding cooked crumbled bacon at the end. Pour over al dente cavetappi and stir to distribute in 13 x 9 pan. One sleeve of crumbled Ritz crackers soaked in a small bit of melted butter goes on top. Bake at 350°F for 30-35 mins on a heavy baking sheet and rotating the pan once 180 degrees to ensure even cooking. Let rest 5 mins.
