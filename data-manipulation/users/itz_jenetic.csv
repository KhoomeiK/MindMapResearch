relationship_advice,ffg12td,t3_etfots,1579896162.0,"Your boyfriend legit said he was lusting after your friend. That’s not someone who cares about you or your feelings. He’s fucking rude, drop him immediately."

relationship_advice,fehxbdm,t3_ep8qay,1579125720.0,"You keep yourself busy with things. Find something new to try and go no contact. I guarantee you that’s what the other person is doing. There’s a lot of memories and emotions that come and go, just let it happen. It’s a lot of cycling through pain, love, anger, disappointment, and sadness. You’re going to be thinking about a lot of shit that’s going to make you feel worse. You’re going to hit a lot of low points where you’re gonna wanna contact them but don’t. Give yourself time to heal and realize that it happened for a reason. If it’s meant to be, they’ll come back. That doesn’t mean wait for them though. Live your life too, because that’s ultimately what your ex would want if they aren’t a complete Ahole lol. Sometimes things just don’t work out, either for several reasons or none at all.  What you can do is find out what you can improve about yourself FOR yourself. You were okay before the relationship, you’ll be okay after it. You can make it."
relationship_advice,fe9ukj7,t3_eo886w,1578941589.0,"Hey man. You remind me of my ex boyfriend because you’re kinda in his shoes right now. Your mindset is the same as mine though. It’s normal to be cycling through sadness, anger, pain, etc. It’s really, really hard for me to not miss him or want to contact him as well because I still love him. I just have my own issues to work through, and maybe so does he. You gotta remember that the relationship ended for a reason and ask yourself if you love yourself and what are things you can work on. It’s stupid but if it’s meant to be then you’ll meet up again in the future. If not, at least you’re able to improve parts of yourself you know? Don’t think about what went wrong or what you could have done because that makes it harder. This also will give you time to think about things clearly and if you want to connect to talk later then you can."

UnsentLetters,fdxrvem,t3_en6bmg,1578772263.0,This was so touching I almost cried.
AskReddit,fdsybql,t1_fdsxma1,1578709530.0,Just tell them no? They aren’t friends if they pressure you and make you feel bad about your choices.
UnsentLetters,fdm51k9,t3_eltkn7,1578539967.0,Right in the feels man. I wanna talk to my ex so bad because I know he’s hurting too and despite everything I want to make him feel better. But you also gotta look after yourself before someone else so.. maybe in the future we can talk again.
PointlessStories,fdkqxxu,t1_fdjp7sk,1578509305.0,"Dude yeah honestly hahah I feel like I look dumb. It’s cool though it’s something we can overcome together! I believe in you friend, no matter where you are I’m proud of you too!"

PointlessStories,fdirw1a,t1_fdip1dk,1578449660.0,"Thank you for that! I was honestly wondering if this was for me after it was over. I have a tendency to “give up” when it gets hard but I really want to change that. It’s a huge flaw of mine. I feel energized from your kindness, I really appreciate it!"

depression,fdhq6ig,t3_elgmr6,1578427984.0,"Yeah do that, take her somewhere so it’s just you two. Enjoy each other’s company, ask her to talk about the things that have been bothering her. Make sure you really, really hash it out. Be affectionate with each other and give it your all. Sometimes people fall out of love but they can fall back in too, make it happen before you guys lose it completely. Good luck man, remember the reasons you fell in love with each other."
depression,fdho5k0,t3_elg8sk,1578426777.0,Talk to him about how you’ve been feeling. These talks need to happen before you move in together. Don’t let it crash and burn you out in the end.

depression,fd80tf6,t1_fd80axg,1578212604.0,"Oh good, I hope it helps her a lot soon! I’m not sure tbh. When someone is that deep in the negative mindset, it’s gonna be really hard to overcome putting a negative spin on everything. I would probably just sit her down and tell her how you honestly feel and care so she knows she has full support. I mean I’m sure you already did that but it’s going to be a lot of reassurance and honestly, just something she has to take time and effort to work through. Maybe just hang out with her and distract her with fun stuff you can do together."
depression,fd7zaj1,t3_eka3q9,1578212114.0,"Hey fam, that’s great that you’re there for her, good on ya. But she should look into therapy if she can, it’s going to destroy her if she doesn’t. Have you tried talking to her about getting professional help?"
depression,fcz0abx,t3_ejmyxp,1578091042.0,"I think it’s best that you talk to her and tell her how you’ve been feeling so she can get a better understanding. Then maybe she could refer you to someone who can prescribe you medication if you really need it. Not saying that you do or don’t, just want you to be safe and informed and know that you aren’t “crazy”. Emotions are hard to manage for some people (me too tbh lol) so don’t feel bad. Just try to pay attention to what triggers you and what makes you happy. I hope you’ll feel better soon, it’s always okay to cry if you need to."

The whole fake it til you make it seems silly but if you aren’t your own cheerleader, no one else will be. Just kidding, that’s what we’re here for! So yes, you can do it! Waking up an hour earlier than usual? Fucking celebration. You took the time to take out the trash? Party it up. All those little things that we don’t even think about for more than a second are still accomplishments, it should matter to you. It’s something that you took initiative to do. Be proud of yourself and don’t put yourself down like that, you’re doing the best you can and that’s honestly enough"
