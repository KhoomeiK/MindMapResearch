His life, even if he’s a doctor now, is miserable in every way, that’s why he’s jealous of you and the only way he knows how to cope with frustration it’s trying to bring you down. Don’t force your kids to talk to him if they don’t want to. Having a present dad is not always the best option if said dad is an effing tool, in this case it’s better having no dad at all."

This was back when the Mexican Revolution happened. My great grandmother was kidnapped when she was 12 by a cacique. He was obviously abusive and a sorry excuse for a human being. He got her pregnant at 13 years old and she had a baby boy. Since she always had have been the baby girl at home and never had younger siblings, she had no idea at how to take care of a baby and eventually the baby died. A couple of years passed where she was treated like a slave wife and then a soldier rescued her. That soldier ended up being my great grandfather."
