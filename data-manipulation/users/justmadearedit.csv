TrueSTL,ffuz0pa,t1_ffuwdxc,1580252062.0,"Bruh, it was on *dank*christianmemes. Do you really think I believe or care if Jesus and the 12 hobos were homos? I just like playing devil's advocate (metaphorically), and you sir got got. You're spot on about the other shit though, bravo armchair psychiatrist!"
todayilearned,ffuxlxa,t1_ffuuiv8,1580251279.0,"It's nothing like racketeering. It has to be a crime, victims don't get *great* ROI they get some ROI, a racketeer creates an artificial problem and offers a solution to the same problem. If you still wanna believe that, cool, but don't be oblivious to the benefits you receive directly. And the DOD budget doesn't just vanish into thin air. It's paying hundreds of billions of dollars in salary to millions of servicemen, federal employees and contractors, buying products from US companies. Military bases can fuel an entire cities economy."
politics,ffuukk6,t1_fftbcuu,1580249621.0,"Lmao y'all a bunch of loonies. Civil war? A huge chunk of the US does not give a shit about politics. A majority wont even lift their fat ass for their own good health, let alone RIOT. Political parties take turns controlling the exec branch ever since John Adams. I'm wondering what DT did that affected YOU personally?"

todayilearned,ffum40z,t1_fft9xfy,1580244854.0,"The return is that your products aren't stolen, degraded, or destroyed entirely which would drive up prices in the market. Is that enough of a ""return"" for you?"
todayilearned,fft9tr7,t1_fft9ihs,1580213730.0,The Navy is there to intimidate pirates and shit. The Army and Marines for exploiting oil rich countries. The Air Force for protecting against all the god damn Chinese cyber attacks.
dankchristianmemes,fft7ugl,t1_ffpw62j,1580211400.0,I don't understand why you have to get so butthurt and defensive over obvious facts. If you wanna follow a homo cult then knock yourself out.
dankchristianmemes,ffpeijl,t1_fflpmc9,1580093053.0,"Is there any better comment to submit that avoids actually providing evidence to support a position, ivr yet to see it. What can you expect from a wanna be hillbilly?"
dankchristianmemes,ffpduwf,t1_ffliz8j,1580092579.0,"That's cool and all but your article has *nothing* to do with ancient Jewish culture. You can't just bunch the entire Middle East into one group, the Jews had different customs from gentiles. My point was that something considered normal in modern day does not mean it was favored in ancient times."

dankchristianmemes,fflgnyu,t1_fflbs06,1580039506.0,"> Cheek kissing in Israel consists of cheek to cheek contact and the sound of a kiss to the air.

LGBT in modern day Israel is a lot more lax now than being stoned to death. So where's your source for Hebrew culture 2000 years ago?"

Thought it was more obvious. Dear friends didn't really kiss cheeks. Bows, kissing on the hand, verbal blessing/greeting, hug was appropriate for non-relatives."
AirForce,ff4iz0u,t1_ff44yvw,1579564747.0,"Yeah where's this BS ""it's taken out our pay"" from? They only take out $400 for a BX gift card to buy toiletries."

funny,fdcsh71,t1_fdcqijl,1578283040.0,Why would he? So they can resume looking for him and catching everyone below the chain for interrogation? Not that I give a damn either way.
