There was still anger but it was refrained a bit because I did expect him to read it, it was almost like a very long daily letter to him. Maybe I will let loose. 

I'm not sure if my WS feels like he can't be my safe space anymore. I see him trying so hard but he also looks so lost sometimes, which I get because this is all unchartered waters but it frustrates me too. Thank you for your words."

I kept a mood journal of sorts also, offered it to him, hoping I guess that he wanted to know my heart but he hasn't read it and I really doubt he will. 

This is strangely beautiful in a way, the vulnerability of it I suppose. It seems you and maybe both of you have had a break through."

Now that being said, OP did edit his post that included more indepth information that would have altered my original comment."

You can still help him with flyers and the like, if you want to, but this dictating what your job should be needs to stop. You want to go to university? Go! Find a way and make it happen.

AsOneAfterInfidelity,ffge4tv,t3_ethewl,1579904209.0,"Last August wasn't that long ago. It's great that things are going well this quickly, but I completely understand the hesitation. Tbh the counselor should have your back on this point for sure. I believe the general rule of thumb is not to make any major decisions the first 6 months to a year. I could be wrong on that time frame, but to me getting married and starting a family are pretty major decisions.


Edited to add - Maybe agree to reevaluate after a year, so this coming August?"

survivinginfidelity,ff7fhtm,t3_es1s8e,1579648349.0,"Expecting faithfulness is not failing. Secure the evidence you do have or as someone else said gaslighting will ensue. Actually, he will probably do that even with the evidence.  Be prepared for it, don't let him minimize this. 

I think we all wonder if the WS ever really loved us. It almost makes it easier to think they must not have, because how can you inflict that much pain on someone you love. Only you can choose which path to take here, how he responds to you confronting him will impact that choice."
AsOneAfterInfidelity,ff7cf2j,t1_ff76rfd,1579646298.0,"On the contrary. I hate the suspicious person I've become. I miss seeing my WS as somehow better than the average man. It's not healthy by any means, but I miss thinking he was pretty much superman."

In early 2018, so right around the time you are looking at, I received a few messages from people I did not know. These were secret messages that disappeared shortly after I opened them. I never touched the secret toggle, didn't know it existed at that point. I responded to the first message because I thought it was an error, wrong person. It did send it as a secret message I suppose because it was a reply to one and there was no previous message history. 

After getting about 3 or 4 of these, all from different people, I toyed around with it with my husband. Sending the secret message did not impact the rest of our messages. So toggling it on seemed to be per message."
AsOneAfterInfidelity,ff6ppjd,t3_ery2ah,1579632292.0,"I have all the same triggers you listed, plus there seem to be a hell of a lot of women that resemble  AP. I think (fingers crossed) I am passed the point of crying with each, it mostly just pisses me off. Like instantaneously. I usually get up get moving and maybe tackle a quick chore, dishes or something.  

I chose not to tell anyone so I don't have any friends seeking me out, not sure I how I would handle that at this point."
AsOneAfterInfidelity,ff6e5ad,t3_ersqhd,1579625228.0,"> So pathetic that she couldn’t get a single man and was used up by mine. That a woman would accept the type of relationship where she is a dirty little secret and being used (


I have discovered that there are women, and I'm sure some men too, who see married/taken men as a challenge. That for them it is just as much about sticking it to the wife as it is landing the guy. 

I'm happy things are working out for you now. As I read your story I was saying No, no,no.... in my head. That's probably one of the things most missed, naivety and complete trust."

survivinginfidelity,ff46ty9,t1_ff3krrg,1579556811.0,"I'm hoping that meant taking responsibility for your part of the relationship issues UP TO the affair? The affair is 100% on the WS but any issue up to that point is shared, albeit not necessarily equally.  

My own relationship was not in a great place. One or both of us should have said - hey this thing is off the rails a bit, we need to fix it. But neither of us did. His choosing to seek an ego trip or whatever outside of our marriage is squarely on him though."

I asked the older kids to bring me the diaper bag or to watch a smaller one while I cooked. The first time I went to the store and left them to look out for eachother they were all school age and I was gone for 30 minutes.

That being said, sometimes I do see that in my head. Usually it's when things are going well. Like my brain trying to tell me don't get too comfortable here, remember what he can be like.

I had never even obsessed over a celebrity, it's just not how my brain works I guess. I can't comprehend the entertainment of feelings at all."

He was having trouble concentrating, and didn't want to get out of bed. Obviously had no one he could talk to about it, except that sub.

This path I am on has been and will be hard for quite some time. You are just a few years older than a couple of our kids, you have an entire life in front of you to make what you want of it. The mama in me wants to hug you and say, run baby girl. The woman in me understands the confusion. Only you can decide what is best for you, and you don't have to make a choice this minute.
