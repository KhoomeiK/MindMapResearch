Libertarian,fgnz0jp,t1_fgn7avi,1580956029.0,"Perhaps we can agree that utopias can't exist? No matter. I haven't been able to visit, yet, but I'd like to see Estonia, Poland and the Czech Republic. I hear they are orders of magnitudes more libertarian than the US. I think it's because when you taste freedom after communism, you never want to go back.

Governments are incapable of altruism, btw. When a government is ""cooperating"" or ""getting altruistic things done"", it is merely a cold machine being steered by very amoral and inconsiderate people in a manner to maximize the concentration of wealth and power into the political elite."
Libertarian,fgn33fw,t1_fgm8tug,1580936769.0,"Thank you for that gift. I have some respect for the curators of that site, because I agree that “anarcho-capitalism”, “anarcho-nationalism” and similar crap don't belong there.

I would go a bit further and state that anarcho-socialism doesn't belong either, not because I don't believe that a socialist nirvana couldn't exist, but because since Marx and Engels first put pen to paper, no one has ever built something that would indicate that it is even remotely possible.

You would have to invent some kind of society where everyone was a willing participant in excess altruism, and lobotomies violate the NAP."
Libertarian,fgiu62u,t3_eyp03f,1580830984.0,"There are many who participate in this sub that don't identify as libertarian. To them I say welcome and if you are interested in engaging dialog about libertarianism, have at it. There is plenty here.

The problem isn't that the sub isn't libertarian, it's that the amount of righty and lefty trolls who come here in order to be obnoxious is too damn high! <insert Jimmy McMillan meme here> and the moderators are too lenient to ban someone for trolling.

The Gods of Reddit have come up with a mechanism by which libertarian thinkers can regain dominance in this sub. It's called the downvote. If you find a Bernie bro being less than civil or someone who has plowed several hours of internet research into the conclusion that ""LibErTariAniSm cOmeS fROm mArXIsm"", feel free to downvote their inane rant into oblivion."

The strategy I would take, however, which seems more flexible, is to use UTF-8 encoding and record [numerically as a binary file](https://support.idautomation.com/Crystal-Reports-UFL/Is-it-possible-to-use-UTF-8-encoding-of-data-in-PDF417-2D-barcode/_1218).

Your typical person on the street thinks of anarchy as against ""capitalist"" or G8-style governments. Most of the ""anarchists"" protesting western democracies would be perfectly happy imposing their ideas for government on others.

The term for self-rule doesn't end in 'archy' and I don't think it should: autonomy."

This is happening today, so it would not be a stretch or impossible to implement private toll roads everywhere.

People still cringe and think of monopoly power being used, but any state transfer to private hands could be granted with conditions that the road be maintained and allow passage to all lawful drivers, at least until the public gets the gist of respecting property owners rights.

Unless the road is totally funded from groundbreaking with private funds, you really can contractually limit a buyer of a public road from the state."

GoldandBlack,ffcfdtk,t1_ffcadgm,1579798272.0,"That's the problem, isn't it? It's all about the perception. Some people view SS as a welfare program. Some see it as a retirement program.

The truth is it doesn't deliver on either of its two assumed objectives. It is the US governments' most ineffective wealth transfer system.

The reason I got a bit pedantic about your use of pronouns is that 'we' (you and I) have no say in what will happen with SS. I would encourage you to do what I did and accept that the SS tax is no different than any other tax. You don't get to decide where the money goes or expect that you will see a penny of it in retirement.

That's all up to people you can never trust to have your interest at heart. What I do is write it off as just another bundle of money I am giving Washington, DC, that I will never see again. I have to look out for myself. So keep shoveling your money into your own private account. It's the only money you can almost count on."
GoldandBlack,ffc1gz3,t1_ffaptmu,1579789134.0,"The problem with SS is that it has been ingeniously engineered by socialists of the past to be unassailable. If you attack it as a shit retirement plan that needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, you get the bleeding heart nail-biters saying ""what about muh gramma?"". If you attack it as a shit welfare plan that needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, you get the indignant financially illiterate spouting ""I been payin into SS all my life... "".

Reformers can't win. My strategy would be to have the surgery to separate the conjoined abomination and reform each part with free market alternatives. You could do this as quickly as Americans have a stomach for it. Which is to say not quickly at all. But a gradual extraction from the beartrap that is SS is better than maintaining the status quo. I'm not saying you could avoid a crisis or the stigma of ""unfairness"", we are currently in an unfair crisis. People just don't know it because they choose to remain uninformed."

What's important is that people like the Dalai Lama, Bill Clinton, and Imran Khan believe in it. Guilty or innocent, publishing these photos will make celebrities less likely to want to publicly associate with people who they know to be scum.
