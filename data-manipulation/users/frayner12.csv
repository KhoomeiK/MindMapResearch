AskReddit,fekrx92,t3_epj100,1579206346.0,Ruiner. Picked it up when it was free on epic and the game is one of the first ive played in a while that makes you feel truly badass asf and powerful. Its a top down dystopian shooter.
OurPresident,fek4lx8,t1_fek3ue1,1579192496.0,What? Nobody here is saying CNN isnt always shit. But say someone random in NY got a disease from a bad crab sold at a market. We woulsnt know and wousnt care too much. But if we have a family member get infected by a bad crab then we would try to bring attention too it since it affected us personally.
wholesomebpt,feektow,t1_feejg1d,1579035778.0,I think the more we ouraelves take each comment as its own with no preconcieved notion the better we will go away from the sexist notions that we have.

LivestreamFail,fedg5ue,t1_fedftif,1579010633.0,"Ah cause people called CallMeCarson a simp, when according to that definition it is like the opposite with him and Katerino"
LivestreamFail,fedfj35,t1_fed8055,1579010134.0,What does simp mean tho. Ive seen many people use it recently but have never seen an actual definition of it
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe6osz9,t1_fe61fm8,1578898558.0,Honestly I wish morals werent a thing so we could just kill anyone who is dooming us all by being selfish themselves. But everyone in the big countries has no personal need or want to be a revolutionary. Its just not a thing nowadays. If it was then presidents would be killed alot more. I mean you have hundreds of thousands of people on 4chan wishing death for trump/Obama but none have actually really tried yet that i know of. No one is going to risk themself for someone else.

MinecraftMemes,fd1c50l,t1_fd1bmxc,1578129674.0,Yes but doors get waterlogged in bedrock unlike java where it is impossible to waterlog them. Enabling underwater mining/exploring easy. Kind of like torches pre aquatic update.
aaaaaaacccccccce,fd1btvf,t1_fd11ntf,1578129560.0,Do you as an ace have someone you love? And if do is that relationship diff from non-aces from what youve seen? Just stumbled across this in r/all and am trying to learn a little more

aww,fcsy56f,t1_fcsngxh,1577928047.0,Damn thats horrible. I really wish there was some kind of test to be allowed to adopt an animal and put it in your care. Even though that is unrealistic
aww,fcse250,t1_fcsdmss,1577915227.0,Yeah a dog is only as good as their owner teaches them to be. They have great potential. But a shitty person will make them a shitty dog
aww,fcsb0x5,t1_fcsah5p,1577914024.0,Cat slaps. Cats slap dogs in the face alot(usually doesnt hurt them) but dogs cant figure out how to make them stop. They just get confused

ShouldIbuythisgame,fcpx9fe,t1_fb5jbxm,1577874126.0,"HK also has some cool movement boosts through the game, but no movement is not its main ""thing"" at all. Its all ab the combat rly. Except for *shudder* path of pain"
ShouldIbuythisgame,fcpwfbw,t1_ev91xdc,1577873607.0,Yeah it shows it in an amazing expressionistic way and uses simple ways to describe it to people who dont deal with it. On top of being an amazing platformer
ShouldIbuythisgame,fcpvyzv,t1_fcpu7v3,1577873323.0,"Cant wait for silksong bro. Its looks sooooooo fun and the customization, like WHAT?!"

OurPresident,fcjnpsm,t1_fcjhga5,1577695558.0,That story was very heartbreaking and its insane to think there are people who are not only having to fight one of the hardest battles out there but them knowing even if they win they will never live a truly free life? This country needs change
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fcim7wd,t1_fcg74z2,1577664912.0,I would have said you were trying to contact the ghost then eventually say you jad made contact and now you had a ghost friend who could haunt anyone for you
FragileWhiteRedditor,fcilgud,t1_fcdhrno,1577664552.0,I thought the problem was that the people switched were orginally white and there was no reason to change races just to meet some race quota?
maybemaybemaybe,fcaztid,t1_fcazpz4,1577579867.0,Man stops without even refuting points. A true hero you are shitting on people for trying to help out people ey?
maybemaybemaybe,fcazh48,t1_fcaywjg,1577579672.0,"No your just insulting me good job peace bringer. Also could you send a study that shows that ""fear in the eyes is an actual thing"" because a fear response would be bery strange to effect the eyes. What your picking up on is facial cues and context. Her eyes have nothing to do with this. This is like saying jumping around a corner with a werewolf costume on and scaring the hell out of them is some unforgiveable sin that will affect them for their whole life. Brighten up bruh"
maybemaybemaybe,fcayhip,t1_fcawbps,1577579120.0,"Bruh it takes alot more then being pulled over and being scared for 10 seconds before being given ice cream to traumatize someone. Traumatized would be if she was pulled over, treated harshly or bad in  a sense for no reason, had her rights ignored or infringed upon all with nothing she had done herself. Now that is what might traumatize someone."
maybemaybemaybe,fcaw30h,t1_fcav571,1577577754.0,"""Accused her"" are we watching the same video? Could you quote where he accused her of anything? Also how the fuck can someone be traumatized through getting given some oce cream. She was traumatized when horrible peices of shit killed people she shares a race with for no reason. All this will do in the long run is provide a funny memory she can look back on. It definitely will for her male friend in the back who cant stop laughing"
maybemaybemaybe,fcau9m2,t1_fcardvw,1577576736.0,Bruh. They fucking gave them free ice cream. And they didnt make a show ir anything. Simply got straight to the point and sent her on her way. Fucking hell man. The guy in the back is laughing his ass off too
politics,fc9xjru,t1_fc8vpv4,1577559691.0,"Oh my god it would be hilarious to do this. Intrrview some big republicans and ask their opinion on ""Clinton's interview"" and recite that interview. They would probably trash it like hell wo/ even knowing bruh"
