Not true. Erebus could always dig it from the rubble, or steal it before Horus actually got around to destroying the planet or something. More importantly, I'm sure Erebus had 12 different contingencies to flip Horus, he was hugely important to Chaos's plans and the Word Bearers are in league with Tzeentch, after all.
