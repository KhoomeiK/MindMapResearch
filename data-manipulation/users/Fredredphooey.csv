I'm so glad you saw their projection and got out. They will replace you soon enough. Keep up the good work!"
HistoricalCostuming,fdx4j2x,t3_en9buw,1578765259.0,"Your post is incredibility well researched and informative. I do wonder though if this doesn't point towards the dress being an invention of CtE's since there is some belief that's true, but also since the dress doesn't make logical sense based on what we know about women's clothing at the time.

Thoughts?

edit: NEVER apologize for yourself unless you did something actually wrong. even in jest. this is one of my hobby horses/pet peeves because we all apologize way too much. :)

And I've been to too many social occasions where all the men are in one room and the women are in the kitchen cooking or cleaning."

AskReddit,fdmiqog,t1_fdm2wn3,1578551369.0,"It used to be more common. I remember Oprah doing a show way back where she challenged three or four families to eat dinner together a couple times a week for six weeks (maybe four? not sure). 

The one family that sticks out in my mind is the one where the dad never made it home. Maybe twice the whole time. Wife was pissed. Steaming anger rising up off of her. Came through the television like fire. Divorce city baby."
