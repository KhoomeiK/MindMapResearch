Beethoven's 9th symphony is one of the pinnacles of Western music without a doubt. But there are equally as many people/critics who say that Bach or Beatles is one of the pinnacles of Western music. Your view that there is this single voice of ""the music critic"" who ""knows"" that Beethoven 9 is simply ""the pinnacle of Western music"" is purely of your own imagination. You holding Beethoven 9 as some standard that every other music should be measured against is purely your own misconception. In fact, there were plenty of well established critics who absolutely hated Beethoven's music during his time and after.

It's totally invalid of you to dismiss Bob Dylan because it doesn't ""meet the standard"" of ""the pinnacle of Western music."" Because pinnacles of Western music take shape in many ways and forms. Maybe you don't like his music- that's fine. But to dismiss its artistic value with such reasons totally invalid"

dr_sharked said ""the lack of minorities"" which is synonymous with lack of racial diversity.

Your comment is a mess and devoid of an actual point. Describing Portland as a community that ""lacks minorities"" is a strictly objective truth. How is that wording racist? Think for a second- what would be a ""non-racist"" way of articulating that fact?

Lack of minorities might not seem like a universal negative to you, but it is to us minorities. It means having to fend for ourselves regarding justifying out culture, being ostracized, etc. When I lived in Indiana, kids made fun of my ""funny smelling"" lunch and other white kids would call me chink etc.. Now in NYC, that kind of stuff almost never happens. In fact, it's the norm for white students at my school to go to K town or Chinatown or eat Halal food.

You need to stop imagining and theorizing in your own head the impact that lack of minorities/racial diversity has on the minorities and start listening. It's undeniable that people of minority would have more experience and knowledge regarding this than you. I don't see why I should keep talking to you when you're so clearly unwilling to listen to a group of people who undeniably and inevitably have more experience and knowledge regarding this than you. Good luck and I hope you try go living in a place of vastly different culture for a few months to start opening your mind."

If you were willing to listen (which you have good reason to as we are people of minority who have personally lived these experiences), you wouldn't have fired off unnecessary shots like that.

> Diversity is defined by an equally valued representation of all kinds of people.

The word ""kinds"" in that definition includes race, sexual identities, age, political identities, economic class, etc. Among those, Portland clearly does not fit the criteria for a racially diverse city.

Those 3 ""different"" definitions of diversity that you describe seem fairly similar to me. It's pretty pointless of you to argue between exact percentage vs quantity vs equal representation when the gist of the definition is the variety of different sorts of people. In regards to race, Portland is not very diverse. That is an objective statement.

Yes the magnitude of the cultural shock is different, but the same principles apply. It's really not a statement meant to reinforce racial tensions. What is so racially divisive about holding racial diversity to be an ideal? In an ideal world, your race's culture would be equally respected and represented as mine or any other. In a society like Portland, the white population is clearly more represented than other minorities. Your unwillingness to recognize this inequality in the first place is why a direction towards true racial diversity feels like ""racism"" to you.

I did not conflate culture with race, and I certainly agree with your point on that. However, for all intents and purposes of this conversation, culture does *in general* fall along the lines of race. I think we're on the same page on that so no need to discuss any further regarding this.

I'm a Korean who has immigrated to this country at a young age. I have experienced my share of what racism can feel like and how lack of diversity can influence my life in a very personal way. You're a white person with you own set of experiences, but by definition as you're not a minority, you don't have a personal experience regarding what life as a minority can feel like. The same way I don't have a personal experience regarding what life as a white person can feel like. Regarding diversity and life as a minority, I have realistic and personal experiences to touch upon while you are more or less theorizing about them."

And let me attempt to explain why it is not indeed racist to be concerned about a lack of minorities. A call for more minority representation is ultimately a call for diversity. Diversity is defined by an equally valued representation of all kinds of people. Like many things in life, context matters in race relations. If diversity is an ideal to be strived for, then it is obviously important to consider the present state of the racial/cultural composition. And considering that this is America, a nation found upon a diverse population, it's more than fair to hold diversity as an ideal to aspire to. Considering this situation, Portland is a city that is mostly white. If  diversity is the ideal, than yes, naturally  the most represented kind of people would make room for the less represented kind of people so that an equal representation can be achieved. Do not confuse this as a call for each race having an absolutely equal share of the population. That is unrealistic and nobody is asking for such a thing. What proponents of diversity are asking for is an equally valued representation of all people.

The same would apply vice versa. If a white person were to go live in a town in China where everyone is Chinese, it would not be racist of him or her to wish for an environment where he feels more properly represented in that society. Though you could argue that China is not a country found upon the ideals of diversity and freedom like America, the natural human longing for social representation remains.

And consider the full extent of your logic- if it's racist to complain about lack of minorities, then what are minorities supposed feel in such a situation?

I highly recommend you spend a few months in a culture significantly different from the one you are used to. You'll begin to see why longing for diversity is not a racist sentiment against the majority race of that culture."

> An increase in the influence of women in public life has often been associated with national decline. The later Romans complained that, although Rome ruled the world, women ruled Rome. In the tenth century, a similar tendency was observable in the Arab Empire, the women demanding admission to the professions hitherto monopolised by men. ‘What,’ wrote the contemporary historian, Ibn Bessam, ‘have the professions of clerk, tax-collector or preacher to do with women? These occupations have always been limited to men alone.’ Many women practised law, while others obtained posts as university professors.
