Imperator,ffe2i1x,t1_ffdy6vx,1579834994.0,"I didnt have an issue. I had Carthage try and invade me while I was in sicily and forts are a real thing. He was taking massive attrition and still couldnt siege my level 10 on the capital. Everywhere that was of strategic significance had atleast a level 5. This game more than eu4 allows a small nation to turtle. Tech is key. By playing small you can get a dozen levels ahead. I was at 32ish when we called it. Albion was capping 30 sparta was at 29 and thrace was at 25ish. No one else was in the 20s. Size matters. Especially psychologically. People with a bunch of land and eyes to the horizon were not building their infrastructure even in their capitals. 

Being willing to go to war and not expect territory is an extremely good bargaining chip. You can ally basically anyone."
Imperator,ffdtzl1,t1_ffd3rm1,1579828880.0,"I'm not 100% sure but I have noticed some sort of cap for distribution. When I got to 350 pops my other cities started getting more of the slaves. Once they hit pop capacity it started going back to the capital. When I got to 530 it started happening again. 

There is an enslavement efficiency stat that I have no idea how it works but seems like it increases the pops you get compared to the pops that die. I might go digging in the files and see what I find. 

I have heard there is a preference for cities the general has holdings in though idk about that. 

I noticed sometimes the slaves would go to allied lands but significantly less if I was on a coastline(interior anatolia would sometimes go to thrace but sicily never went to rome)."
Imperator,ffch9xf,t1_ff9yrjs,1579799434.0,I dont think you need to move the slaves back out.
Imperator,ffc5frl,t3_esnfas,1579791955.0,"Encourage trade, build aqueducts if they are literally overpopulated, build mills as opposed to academies or forums(slaves eat the least), oratory investment to get a trade route for more grain/getting all the % buffs, move slaves into your farm settlements, move slaves out of the province, upgrade you capital to a metropolis if it has 80 pops and is over populated."
Imperator,ffc2xi0,t3_esmp2s,1579790218.0,Release some states that are wrong culture wrong religion as client states. Convert then assimilate the others. Annex you clients and convert/assimilate.
Imperator,ffc2qyg,t3_esrsux,1579790085.0,I like monarchies as you can try and get blood of the argeads on your ruling family. When I play a republic I used to try and get each diadochi to have a family branch in my country now that isnt possible. You are better off forming a monarchy and getting a member of each diadochi family adopted. You can create different family branches with the different bloodlines.
Imperator,ffc1x03,t1_ffbuwjy,1579789468.0,Slaving is a huge incentive. I was in an mp that ended saturday. I was playing tall ionia and had managed to steal so many pops I had the second most populace region losing to Mesopotamia by 2 pops. I joined 4 different wars over the last 2 sessions just to get slaves. Took ephesos from 250 pops to 550 pops. So yea in single player there is no incentive not to blob but for mp I think imperator or stellaris does tall best.

news,ff9ask8,t1_ff977ex,1579708733.0,"It absolutely should be a standard that people who are responsible for enforcing the law are given harsher sentences than normal. As for repeat offenders there is logic to giving them harsher sentences. That is the point of having a range of punishment and a reasoning person responsible. You better find a position, it will be too late by the time it is personally relevant."
news,ff93keq,t1_ff92fnj,1579703992.0,He is saying they shouldn't be getting minimum sentences. There were 3 more years this judge could have added to this cop's sentence. He chose not to. Cops should be held to the same higher sentences others are allowed to be held to. If someone commits multiple crimes they get the maximum sentence. Why shouldn't the cop who is supposed to know and enforce the law be held to the same standard as a repeat offender?

Imperator,fegmbxv,t1_feelx17,1579097117.0,"Horses, the trade good, have no relation to chariots. The prevalence of chariots actually implies there should be no horse trade good as the horse trade good represents horses strong and big enough to be cavalry. Chariots used weaker horses because that is what they had. Complain about how shit chariots are in imperator. Dont complain india doesnt have something they shouldn't have."
