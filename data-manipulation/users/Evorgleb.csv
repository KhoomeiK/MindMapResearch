23andme,ffe2kjt,t1_ffb68fg,1579835045.0,"I am no expert in the science behind it but scientists and scholars who study this, such has Henry Louis Gates say that tracing ancestry of African Americans, in most cases, leads to a white male ancestor during the time of slavery. It is almost never a white female. And even if there was mutual attraction, one can make the argument that a slave can not actually consent to sex with someone that owns or has power over them. 

Of course, generations later we see interracial relationships that are consensual but most African-American's European DNA is from before the Civil War, not recent decades. That means the admixure mostly happened with white males and presumable enslaved females. A good example would be President Thomas Jefferson who fathered several children with a female slave who was also rather young. Though modern retelling of this relationship try to romanticize it, its hard to square that as anything other than rape.

Hogan is a crystal clear case of a person being racist. There is no way to to spin what he did. All the facts are there and they are undisputable.

And to be honest with you the reason why I and so many others always bring up Hogan's racism is because he never showed remorse and he never apologized. He just went around giving heart felt speeches about how it sucks to have your private conversations publicized.

StreetFighter,fe99rhz,t1_fe985i2,1578935637.0,"Seems the general consensus is leaning towards ""they/them"". So I'll just go with that."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fe3ga4n,t1_fe3f4zb,1578849026.0,I rarely say it at all these days.
FragileWhiteRedditor,fe3fprz,t1_fe38ihc,1578848847.0,I also wish black people would stop using it. Not because I don't think we have every right to reclaim the word but because there will always be people who try to flip black people saying it as an excuse for them to say it also. And at this point I'm just tired of it.
FragileWhiteRedditor,fe3esnt,t1_fe397y7,1578848646.0,"Wtf are you basing that on? I'm a successful black person who socializes with other successful black people and of course we still care about this. The N-word is and the conversations around it show that racism is very much still real and that there are still efforts to opress black people.

Just because I have been able to achieve a level of success does not make me or my kids immune to racism. 

What would make you even say something like that?"
FragileWhiteRedditor,fe3dbdh,t1_fe3aair,1578848273.0,... It's really not though.

Hulu,fdzta10,t1_fdpn2nh,1578795285.0,"Between FX and the Fox catalog of films, Hulu is going to be pretty stacked"
Hulu,fdzifm3,t3_enfl34,1578790532.0,I have. I assumed it was a feature not a bug.
television,fdyw5s0,t3_en8fy5,1578784193.0,Don't believe this at all
StreetFighter,fds1b08,t1_fdrymqb,1578692793.0,"Right, because that's what I'm worried about and not confusing conversations about the character."
StreetFighter,fdrvvg7,t1_fdrurt8,1578690520.0,No fictional character is a real person. Yet we give them names and address them with pronouns.
StreetFighter,fdrvn6r,t1_fdrutwm,1578690385.0,People who like consistently?
