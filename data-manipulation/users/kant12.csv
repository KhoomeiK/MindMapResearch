politics,ffg7uq7,t3_etdpbo,1579900344.0,We're all talking about the effect of the endorsement on Bernie but Rogan is going to get a lot more viewers out of this. Which I think is good. His show is really good a lot of the time and to me it outweighs the bad.
gaming,fffmzt6,t3_et8zam,1579887454.0,You purchase bad games.
funny,ffeljwr,t1_ffe57m1,1579853196.0,Well lots of people mistakenly get married and if it falls apart it was probably for the best. Better to learn it was a mistake sooner than later.
funny,ffe2mi9,t1_ffdw6wf,1579835085.0,I mean you can be mad at both but one of the two had zero obligations or commitments to you.
funny,ffe2jom,t3_et0lng,1579835027.0,"Your home was already wrecked. Blame the person you were married to since, you know, it was their fault."
politics,ffdcv0x,t1_ffd9mnn,1579818194.0,It's good for everyone if young people are able to contribute to the economy and not drown in debt. Don't be so selfish. I paid my 50k in college loans myself but I'm very happy that others may not have to suffer like I did. Especially since I learned 95% of what I needed on my own but I needed the piece of paper to get hired.
politics,ffdcizq,t1_ffdbab4,1579817983.0,It helps when you look at facts objectively regardless of who is stating them.
todayilearned,ffc3jpl,t1_ffc2mev,1579790662.0,Something doesn't become less bad simply because something else is worse.

politics,ff9he1c,t1_ff8wpi4,1579713059.0,Wow.
politics,ff8k46h,t1_ff8dars,1579682265.0,Yep. People compare Bernie supports to a cult but you have Hillary people still referring to her as Madam President. It's pretty crazy.
politics,ff80nuz,t1_ff7eo5o,1579662922.0,True but it's not worth the energy defending terrible people even when they're in the right.
funny,ff2clzo,t1_fexcueu,1579500797.0,I never said they were tyrants but giving people value based on birthright is never a good idea. Even if it happens to be benign in recent years.
politics,fex6ut5,t1_few8jjy,1579425588.0,Then people better stop supporting terrible candidates like Biden.
politics,fex6iuf,t3_eqs7w6,1579425353.0,Hillary said the same exact thing 4 years ago. How many more years of evidence do they need?!

AdviceAnimals,fecpodc,t3_eoe10p,1578980157.0,Trump screws up everything. I'd sooner expect him to make a deal selling arms to Iran to help wipe out the revolt. Then say he made a great new ally for the U.S.
politics,fecphml,t1_febq9cw,1578979991.0,That video is exactly why the argument about Bernie not being vetted is complete nonsense. Go ahead and try and dig up his past. You'll find almost nothing but videos like this that make him seem even better than you thought he was.
politics,fecp7sl,t1_fecnmf2,1578979748.0,"You're missing the point. Corruption is a negative to far more people on the left than it is to people on the right. Trump isn't going to lose anyone from his base due to his actions but Hillary did lose some support from her base because of her actions. Of course, that does not mean those people switched sides and voted for Trump but it did push some people to stay home or vote for Jill."
funny,fe1lazr,t3_enllfa,1578827986.0,This an impressively bad post even by reddit standards.
AdviceAnimals,fe0jq3h,t3_en74ub,1578814547.0,I hope I never have to experience what my tinnitus will be like at 100.

politics,fdy61w3,t1_fdxh34y,1578776496.0,A poor educational system and lack of economic opportunity is a bigger factor than simply people being stupid.

politics,fd1i1lt,t1_fcycjd8,1578131507.0,That didn't even happen but OK.
AdviceAnimals,fcysv0t,t1_fcxnmro,1578086347.0,Or really they just use it as a way to avoid taking responsibility.
politics,fctebjc,t1_fct4eh5,1577940536.0,"Medicare for All Who Want It is a terrible idea. The last thing we need is a system where all the rich people can opt out and leave the rest of society to suffer.

Voting rights are just part of the game for most democrats. They think they'll get more votes if they expand rights and repubs think dems will get less votes if the reduce rights. Voting for someone based on them pushing for things that benefit them personally is hardly a good option."
politics,fcsp6nt,t1_fcsg5no,1577921604.0,The only thing a centrist will do better than someone like Bernie is allow the senate to pass bad things.
aww,fcs5ns2,t3_eie0cl,1577911793.0,Stop posting this.
politics,fcm7rnr,t1_fcllfc1,1577766470.0,Do you think Warren will run 3rd party too if she isn't the nominee? How about Buttigieg? Or Harris? No. Obviously. The fact that Tulsi isn't given the same benefit of the doubt is the problem. It all has to do with these  nonsense hit pieces and we need to be better at not falling for it and contributing to the noise and hysteria.
politics,fcle8av,t1_fcl9s0e,1577745761.0,Why do you believe conspiracy theories like that when there's zero supporting evidence? You may not agree with her but she doesn't have a track record of lying. If anything she's shown a willingness to take tough stances that get her attacked by all sides.
politics,fcle0lc,t1_fckzjvo,1577745620.0,So true.
politics,fckz7cz,t1_fck27iu,1577736351.0,Most attackers on her have about as much as basis as this one.
politics,fckz4bb,t1_fckklcm,1577736300.0,Exactly. I don't know if everyone here are bots or something but I only see like a dozen sane commenters anymore.
politics,fckywg9,t1_fcjyyfb,1577736164.0,She's not running as 3rd party. How many times does she have to explain that? I also find it funny that with all the complaining people do about her yet she's still to the left of Hillary.
politics,fckynze,t1_fcjy449,1577736018.0,Except she isn't.
politics,fcky7xx,t3_ehlepq,1577735747.0,Even Obama missed 64% in all 2008 when he was running. This fall was particularly busy for candidates so how is this really surprising? Just another silly article.
todayilearned,fcjm783,t1_fcj991k,1577693485.0,"The article seems rather silly. The text in the treaty is rather plain and simple and a lot of thought is put into wording treaties which we have to adhere to as law. I honestly don't know how it could be misinterpreted.

The articles talks about historical context and I guess needing more evidence and then quotes Adams. But how does one random quote from one president have equal weight to what was written on a legal document on behalf on the whole nation? Besides Adams doesn't even reference anything christian. Unless we're supposed to assume that any generic reference to god is meant to be taken as a christian reference. And the fact that the treaty was rewritten later really doesn't change anything. It's not like it added a correction. I think I remember why I've never been fond of anything I read on pantheos."
todayilearned,fcjl7dc,t1_fcio2ne,1577692178.0,Trump could get away with it. Don't kid yourself.

politics,fc7au2f,t1_fc587ym,1577502124.0,"I am someone who read the articles, watched every minute of the hearings, and thinks Trump should have been impeached a year ago. The justification for a delay is extremely weak and it seems likely they had no plans and are desperate."
politics,fc4syo5,t1_fc4rg5e,1577427237.0,How are you gauging the majority of Americans? It seems to me like the dems must not have a very good case if they're now having second thoughts about releasing it to the senate.
politics,fc4sv48,t1_fc4skc6,1577427132.0,If they don't receive it then they don't have to have a trial. The obvious way to look at it is that the dems don't have enough evidence.
politics,fc4r07f,t1_fc4p54m,1577425256.0,I can't imagine anyone actually looking at it like that.
politics,fc4k4cm,t3_eg3b5w,1577419005.0,Yes hold back giving them something they don't want. Makes perfect sense.

politics,fbztxx4,t1_fbztakz,1577261371.0,What in the world are you talking about? Him and Biden both do great against Trump. But nobody thinks there should be a coronation or that it's his turn. He's earned his place in the top tier through working hard even while being largely ignored by the mainstream.
