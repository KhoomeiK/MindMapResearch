These people were made unemployed, then persuaded they would be unable to work for the rest of their lives but would be supported by the state, then became the target for IDS's radical and genocidal welfare reforms of the early '10s.

She is deeply factional and divisive. She spent 4 years sabotaging Corbyn. Had she taken over as leader the entire left wing of the party would prioritise deposing her over anything, elections, fighting the Tories, whatever.

This means out of self-preservation she would have had to kick Momentum, JVL and thousands of individual members who don't like her programme. Because if she didn't they'd no confidence her at every opportunity and vote her out first chance they got.

Crace seems to be stuck in the past that Britain basically wants a Blairite to vote for. That is why he thinks Phillips is electable   - the old idea that if you shift centre you can take the left for granted while sweeping up the liberal vote.

What he's ignoring is the British public want radicalism. At recent elections people have either voted for Brexit (""to shake things up"") or for Corbynism. The public just got offered a centrist technocratic Remain option and that party got, what, 12 seats?

Veganism may be attractive to some people with eating disorders because generally we're slimmer. It also appeals strongly to young women who are the demographic most likely to be suffering from an eating disorder.

But going vegan doesn't turn you anorexic or anything like that so let's be careful in our phrasing so that we don't give people the impression that it might do.
