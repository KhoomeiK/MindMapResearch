selfimprovement,ffo4fay,t3_eu6lid,1580074036.0,There’s going to be a point in every decade that you can’t remember your life in the previous one. It’s normal. I hope.
confession,ffj2bzm,t3_etwcac,1579988625.0,Why do they keep you in the basement?
Asexual,ffid242,t3_eticve,1579970980.0,I’m so glad I found this sub. I loved reading that; felt like I wrote it myself. Fuck ‘em is exactly right. I can’t believe they don’t see how weak that shit is! I am so excited to never have sex again and I think I’m going to laugh right in their face if another human ever tries to make me feel guilty about it again. I’m so much stronger now than I was in those days; NEVER AGAIN ALLOASSHOLES
