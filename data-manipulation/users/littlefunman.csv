I think our periods talk to us. Feminine energy needs a better world and can become enraged when that just isn't being realised and we are not being appreciated and treated with basic kindness and respect. 

Drop the gold star employee stuff. I'm sure its nice for them to have you around  but if yo already feel like you cant ask for what you need then you need to do what you need to do and look after number 1. Lifestyle changes are often what we need when our periods talk to us like crazy x"

I drink cacao first thing every morning. Cacao is a godsend. I carry on eating 85 percent chocolate during the day. I'm allowed eat as much as I like. Like, anytime of the month. Because Winter. 

I also love lentils which are hormone balancing. I'm happy if one of my meals during my ""autumn"" (saying hell week doesnt work for me)  is my lentil curry. Once I've had lentil curry the cravings are sorted. I try make big batches. 

I drink loads of kefir as well. It helps with the sugar cravings, feels nice and heavy in my tummy like ice cream, and helps with gut health.

I was in the process of coming off Sertraline anyway when I started taking mushrooms. I think there were a couple of days when I had both and there weren't any issues. I prefer microdosing without having had Sertralaine, and that's just something my body told me.
 

In the middle of this time of coming off Sertralaine and starting microdosing I had an acupuncture session. It was trippy and beautiful. I meditated while the needles did their work. A big white rush of energy swept in and laughed at the medication. I was relieved of a lot of depression. I find it so helpful and it really compliments and guides my microdosing practice."

 Be nice and do things but dont create a dependency. Support her to find the strength inside to fight it. 

What I needed was easy to understand research. It took me a while to find the focus and clarity to be able to look stuff up. When I found the right info I wished it was in an easy to read format. At the same time I may have felt pressured and then rebelled against that sort of help. 

But what I struggled with may not be her struggle so I would suggest finding out what she wants to do/know and help her to get closer to that in a way that is empowering for her.

Guide her to this thread, theres lots of good tips on it. Or tell her to come here and vent. There are other threads such as r/psychadelicwomen that are helpful too

Would this idea work? 
Book her an acupuncture appointment, tell her a friend of yours online  swears by it. I get that it's not everyone's jam but if it was booked, maybe she will give it a go.

 If she still doesnt want to, it cures so many things that I'm sure you would benefit from it.

People have good experiences by running the pill continually with no breaks, following consultation with GP or the implant, which stops periods.

Jasons vit c eye cream has really helped with lines in the past but not so much with darkness under the eye. I feel when i take iron tablets too it doesnt look so bad. I will look for a post for you from a few months ago that recommended rosehip eye cream

I havent found the perfect answer, i have made some improvements but haven't got rid of them. I use bb cream on them now. Peach colour corrector neutralises purple. Go easy with creams and oils and use light stuff because you could get milia."
