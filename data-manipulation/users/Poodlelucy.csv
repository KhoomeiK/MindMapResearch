houseplants,fguuzpx,t1_fgutan0,1581130022.0,I agree. I have to admit she did a good job when she selected him over all the other ones photosynthesizing on the shelves at the store. This one has a clear sense of humor and irony. (Jealous!)

Electromagnetics,fgup790,t3_f03rx0,1581126224.0,It also helps to sleep in a different room from your phone - especially if you have wifi. Put it somewhere else or turn it off for the night. We sleep a third of our lives so why not stop exposure to that third by removing your phone from the equation? I was skeptical until I started sleeping far away from my phone. I had been sleeping poorly maybe 4 or 5 hrs/night but now I'm zonked out without sleeping aids for a minimum of 8 or 9 hours/night. Our cellphones are absolutely as poisonous as the EMF.

proplifting,fgugakn,t1_fgufky7,1581120075.0,Wow thanks! I appreciate it. I had previously resigned myself to the fact I'd be asking my dogs for advice on orchids. They act like they know it all (about everything!) but I suspect they are mostly bluffing. I'll definitely follow your ig account.

proplifting,fguemu7,t1_fgudgh4,1581118931.0,"No need to be nervous. The only harm you can do is watering them too much at this stage. I especially like it when I find twins or triplets at the end of the shriveling/shriveled mother leaf. It's like winning the lottery!  I separate these siamese twins (or triplets) surgically with clean, sharp scissors during the MLA (mother leaf amputation). Just FYI I recommend using acronyms when the mother plant is within earshot lol. This procedure hasn't failed me yet. The only caveat is not to water immediately. Let them callouse before making your next move."

aww,fgudfas,t1_fgucyz7,1581118105.0,"The trick is to make the cheese into a bullet shape and use your finger as a slow, gentle firing pin down the dog's cake hole. Therefore eating the pill(s) encapsulated in cheese isn't an elective. The cheese just makes it a nice size and shape for handling. Minus the cheese, most pills are too small or oddly shaped for our human fingers to slip down there."

dangerous_tech,fgpv927,t1_fgptfqj,1581012670.0,"You're smart to be gluten free. I should probably make an effort to do that but it will be a hard sell for my husband. Wheat is sprayed 4 times - well, technically, the wheat fields are sprayed that many times when you include pre-sowing. We're in an area with a lot of Amish and you may be shocked to know they are using glyphosate now. Not sure if this is more or less disgusting but the many Amish farms are fertilizing fields with human waste (biosolids) and being paid $20k/acre for it. Sorry to bitch and moan. I'm very disenchanted with all of it and nobody around here has a clue. I spent a couple of hours on 2/3/20 driving around and taking pics of the all-day and frequently renewed grid pattern of chemtrails in the sky and I seemed to be the only one who noticed. 
Maybe I'm going crazy."
dangerous_tech,fgp8wnm,t1_fgo5uj5,1580999707.0,Lol to Brondo. Idiocracy is one of my absolute favorites. Glad you mentioned glyphosate. I live in a rural area and have horrible reactions whenever it is sprayed on fields and crops. You probably know this already but wheat gets sprayed 4 times and corn gets 3. I lobbied the Dept of Ag to be added to the exclusion zone but that only keeps actual spraying 300' away. Rubbish. Everything Monsanto has said has been a lie and glyphosate has brazenly poisoned the entire planet. It. Is. Disgusting.

Speaking of CA, I am shocked there hasn't been a public outcry over what have so obviously been a pattern of unnatural and highly suspicious ""wildfires.""
