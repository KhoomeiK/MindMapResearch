Ohh advice for platinum NMR, you’re best to figure out where in the spectrum you’re going to be looking and only run around there as wide spectral fields limit your resolution and platinum has such a huge spectral width (like 7500 ppm) that you’re peak would potentially not contain multiple (or any!) data points - that’s bad - if you ran the full width spectrum in one go.

If you have no idea where your signal is going to be, then split the whole spectral window into 4 2000 ppm blocks, from -7000 to 1000 and shift the centre of the window around. 

And run 3-4 pulse spectra in each window until you see the peak. Then narrow a bit more and run something like a 500 ppm window roughly centred on your peak.

The good news is Pt is only about half as sensitive as phosphorus so this doesn’t take long, and it’s rare you can’t narrow the range down to at least 3000 ppm off of similarities to other reported shifts.

But otherwise you end up chasing errors and noise thinking they are real peaks."
Chempros,ffjscr1,t1_ffgk9b5,1580005635.0,"As long as it’s a well known compound it really doesn’t matter! 

We set up platinum, mercury, nitrogen-14, selenium and tellurium in our spectrometer with homemade standards... The only one that used the accepted standard was the platinum (because Na2PtCl6 was a thing we had), but are we fuck dealing with Me2Hg, Me2Se, Me2Te or ammonia under pressure...

I’d ask around your department, I’m sure someone will have some sodium hexachloroplatinate - I’m surprised you don’t. If you have the potassium salt that’s fine as well.

Same with diphenyl diselenide (although it’s not expensive) I’m sure someone has a old bottle lying around. 

We’ve had no issues with using these references and we get the same chemical shift as reported when we make literature compounds.

Biggest advice I give to all new phd students, make sure you are happy! 

That’s it, if you’re happy; you’re work will go better, you’ll be more productive, you won’t feel like it’s the end of the world when it inevitably goes wrong, and it’s just better.

So go to the places, look around and figure out which place you’d rather live. 

If they both come out the same, go by the likely projects.

Yes, your happiness is more important than the research proposal! Yes, I know that sounds weird but if you do better at research, you’ll get better papers and it really doesn’t matter where you are a good paper makes a great phd. 

I’ve seen far too many talented phd students end up incredibly depressed by everything to not say happiness is more important.

A phd is a potentially very lonely existence, everyone around you who in a normal job would be a coworker is actually potential competition for something, it can get very cut throat in certain groups (group culture is the single biggest thing to check out on visit days, ask people in groups you have no interest in about the ones you are, they’ll tell you the real stories). And it is such an individual effort over such a long time it’s obviously isolating that way, very few people in the world get what you do. 

I’ve heard and seen some real horror stories of groups and the phd students either do great (on paper) but hate research, or they get chewed up and spat out. Then there are one or two members of the group who thrive because they do the stabbing - not a nice environment.

All this is why mental health issues are such a big thing among graduate students.

So advice in order;

Go where you think you’ll be happy - but check the places out first don’t dismiss out of hand.

Pick research you find interesting not research you think will be big news. 

Ask around on visit days, find out if members of the groups you’re interested in are always first in and last to leave, ask about post docs - they are rarely the cause of bad lab culture on their own but they are the best people at amplifying shit ones (my goal as post doc, don’t amplify shit lab culture).

And finally for when you finally do the phd!

Biggest advice, your PhD is surprisingly little work! What do I mean by that because it’s a lot of work?! Right?

Yes, but really your PhD thesis will end up being 6 months to a year of actual work you did. Because the rest of the time will all be spent on failed shit, so remember that’s not your fault that’s just research. 

I think the work in my thesis was maybe 8 months of my actual PhD...  

So how does that affect live? Simple! If you aren’t being productive, don’t be afraid to go home - find a PI who understand being in the lab for 15 hours a day doesn’t make you more productive. 

Single best thing about my PhD PI, he gave literally zero fucks about what I did or when I did it as long as at the end I got a PhD and he got some papers. 

 Is my existence as a PhD student was taking the piss, I’d fairly often start at 10 or end at 4. Occasionally both... That’s not realistic and was heavily based on my chemistry (lots of 24 hour reactions). But I stand by my advice and say it to every phd student when they look fucked “get to a stopping point and go home”. 

It works, without fail they come back the next day and do better than they were. You need to give yourself breaks, research isn’t robotic it needs your brain and that only works well when it’s tested and happy. Working 13 hours then having a 2 hour group meeting at 8 pm on a Wednesday makes no one happy. 

So don’t be afraid to ask for time off for vacations, don’t be afraid to take occasional long weekends, don’t be afraid to leave at 5 pm, or even 4. 

Just make sure if you’re going to no one can question your work, if your work is excellent and progressing acceptably and you have a reasonable PI they’ll have no argument. And don’t take the piss!"

chemistry,ffim2vg,t3_etto23,1579977133.0,"Well, I feel fairly safe telling you how to do this since it would be absolutely impossible to do at home. 

For 1, NBr3 explodes at -100 C... So you can’t make it at room temperature.

But I’m still going to a start with, absolutely do not do this. It isn’t just the final compound is a problem but lots of other things in the synthesis are dangerous.

Anyway;

Your idea for making it absolutely won’t work, if you take R2NH and HBr you’ll make [R2NH2]^+ Br^- a simple acid + base reaction.

——

So how would we go about it? Well you first need to make the [bis(trimethylsilyl)amine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bis(trimethylsilyl)amine) (that’s the (CH3)3Si)2NH stuff - also called HMDS), that’s fairly trivial if you have the stuff to do it...

You need anhydrous liquid ammonia (not the stuff you use for cleaning, pure NH3 at -33 C), then you react Me3SiCl with that and it gives you your product (if you really wanted this compound then you’d probably buy it). 

Ok now we have (Me3Si)2NH, how do we make that H into a Br? 

Well, first we need to deprotonate it - as we learned earlier this compound is a base! So we need to deprotonate a base. How do you do that? You need an extremely strong base so our strong base acts as an acid.

That is [n-butyl lithium (BuLi)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Butyllithium) - that is a butane where one hydrogen atom has been replaced with a lithium atom... It reacts violently with water and is pyrophoric - burns spontaneously in air.

So we take our BuLi and our HMDS to make the lithium amide - [LiHMDS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_bis%28trimethylsilyl%29amide), I wish Wikipedia would use different brackets in urls, it means you can’t format reddit links properly...

This also is pyrophoric and reacts violently with water...

Then finally once you have your pure LiHMDS you react that with elemental bromine.

If you were in a research lab wanting to do this, you can buy LiHMDS but I’d probably buy the HMDS and purify it to very high levels then do the deprotonation myself, just because it’ll be better.

——

Now in a real lab, that’s all very possible and not all that scary. I would feel very comfortable doing all of it. It requires schlenk lines, glove boxes, properly water and air free solvents, good practical skills and a bunch of expensive (millions) equipment to analyse it but it’s very possible.

Outside of a properly equipped lab, it’s impossible. The BuLi would decompose the second your tried to use it. The Me3SiCl would fume HCl into your face the second you tried to use it, if you some how made the LiHMDS it would burst into flames the second you tried to use it.

Then eventually the NBr3 would explode and kill you.

So don’t.

But it was a interesting set of reactions to talk about so enjoy!"

And no she isn’t legally obligated to face the consequences of anything - that’s why this is happening... If she were, she’d have been extradited.

chemistry,ff7iarz,t1_ff4qsas,1579650201.0,"So the reason colours exist is because of absorptions and emissions of photons by electrons changing energy levels. 

Basically something being blue tells us that all of the photons which are lower in energy (red/green) are being absorbed by the solution. 

The link the other person posts actually has the calculated UV-Visble spectrum on solvated electrons - but it’s a pretty dense paper even for a chemist so I wouldn’t expect you to know half of what it’s talking about - the general idea is because there are so many different things present in the solution - there is e@(NH3)n]^- - this is your solvated electrons with n being the number of ammonia molecules (2-8) they all have slightly different spectra, and when don’t really know where they absorb, computational chemistry didn’t like them.

We also have [Li(NH3)4]^+ your lithium cation - this absorbs in the near infrared with a tail into the red part of the visible spectrum (not enough to explain anything on its own).

So the real reason for the colour is ion pairs, these are when the [e@(H3N)n]^- and [Li(NH3)4]^+ get close together (but don’t recombine) so we have contact of some type - for example some of the nitrogen atoms of the e cluster are coordinating lithium ions.

In those, where n is smaller the clusters absorb light in the red part of the spectrum and larger clusters in the green. 

Since you get a mixture in solution you end up with blue! The [e@(NH3)n]^- clusters probably absorb at similar sort of wave lengths but like I said computational methods didn’t like them (very complicated but basically computational chemistry doesn’t like calculating absorptions and it also dislikes anions and a localised electron is pretty much the nightmare of computational chemists).

So why do these species absorb light in the red and green parts of the spectrum? Well, it just happens that the lowest energy level of the free electron in those clusters happens to be that energy difference away from the second level. 

Ok so obviously you can ask why is the energy gap that? Well the answer to that has to do with the size of the box (the cavity in the cluster) you put the electron in. But it isn’t something I’m going to be able to explain, that’s going to need a physicist and an awful lot of quantum mechanics to figure out. But basically, bigger box bigger energy gap so for small clusters you get absorption in the red and larger ones it’s in the green. 

You may ask why you don’t get even bigger ones that make it blue, well the answer is you do, the solution does absorb slightly in the blue part of the spectrum but those clusters tend to break into smaller ones - the smaller clusters are just more stable. 

———

That’s the blue colour covered! And if you’re wondering, it basically doesn’t matter what metal you dissolve - you get the same spectrum. Because it’s the electrons in ammonia that are giving the colour not the metal - so any alkali metal (group 1) or any alkaline earth metal (group 2) gives the same spectrum. You see very very minor differences with europium but that is probably because the [Eu(NH3)n]^+ ion absorbs at a very different wave length from the alkali metals - the n is somewhere between 7-10 there (compare with 4 in the other examples!) but I can’t be bothered to check. The point is it doesn’t matter what the metal is, because the blue is from the electrons moving around on their little box. 

Also doesn’t really matter what the amine is! Again because the electrons still end up in the same size of box - although there is probably more difference there, but it’s still blue.

——

Thankfully, the gold/bronze colour is a bit easier to explain!

It’s a metal, at this point there are so many electrons running around that the liquid is now metallic. Btw for it to be a metal the electrons delocalise over the whole thing, so there are now so many electrons in solution that they freely move around the liquid, they are no longer in clusters but rather a sort of web (the density of the metallic phase is about 30% lower than liquid ammonia). 

So the solution is shiny for the same reasons metals are - essentially no photons and absorbed and all just bounce off - that’s your silver colour for any metal.

But it is bronze? Ok so that’s harder to explain, basically metals absorb photons in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. But in the case of this liquid that absorption fails into the visible region and that removes some blue from the spectrum - giving you a bronze colour.

As for why exactly it does it, who fucking knows. Probably something to do with the formation of very large clusters of ammonia molecules which would absorb in the blue region but that’s guess."

It’s not a case of punishing the poor over the rich it’s a case of picking the group you’re more likely to catch. 

Remember people falsely claiming benefits are literally stealing money from the government - that’s taxes already paid that are being used to pay these people.

chemistry,ff5rc5l,t1_ff4c6bp,1579607205.0,"Uhmm, so these solutions aren’t really radical anions they are actually electrons which are solvated the same way a cation is solvated in a solution. 

You get clusters of ammonia molecules (7 or 8) which arrange themselves to form a cavity with their hydrogen atoms pointed in the way - to make a sphere with a radius of about 2.5 Å - and the electron sits in that cavity.

Now of course you can view it as one large molecule with a SOMO that is localised in that cavity (because that is what it is). But you’ll probably agree it doesn’t sound like a normal radical anion and it is the same structure you get if you just work out how the dipole of ammonia would interact with a negative point charge. That’s why it’s referred to as a solvated electron rather than as an ammonia radical.

2. As far as I’m aware the blue colour is (essentially) the same no matter what the electrons are solvated in - there is probably the most minor of shifts in wave length but to us it’s the same colour.

Look you can obviously do this if you want but this is not a safe procedure to be doing at home (or anywhere outside an industrial plant designed for it) with equipment you’ve just kind of made up.

To convert white phosphorus to red phosphorus you need to heat it in the absence of air - in an inert atmosphere - you’ll have oxygen in that pipe, which means the phosphorus is going to start burning and at that point you’re going to get incredible pressures in that pipe. That flame is something like 3000 C - the pressure will be insane if any amount of it catches fire and you’re just hoping the pipe survives long enough for it to burn itself out. 

Also to actually convert white phosphorus to red at a decent rate you need to hit over 300 C, 250 will take days as well... [This paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01215a052) has the kinetics, as you’ll be able to see at 250 C and 1600 minutes (26.5 hours) the reaction mixture was still 56% white phosphorus - that means it would take what about 5 days to hit 99% done. 

To get 100% in the 6 hours you plan would require about 320 C.

That also means you’re talking something like 11 atmospheres of pressure in your pipe... Better be really well made.

290 C would get you about 60-70% in 6 hours. Although then you’d only be at 10 atmospheres of pressure... still terrifying.

Now not a reaction I’ve done but a reaction I had the fortune to be near was using diisopropyl ditelluride - yes low molecular weight ditellurides, that was one of the worst smells I’ve ever encountered.

And the worst lab smell I ever encountered was when we were cleaning out some old retiring professors lab and we were picking out some chemicals we liked to the look of and then our health and safety coordinator asked us to kill some old ruined organometallics the guy had lying around. 

That’s the background but what happened next was a big fuck up, we found a 3 L flask of butyl phosphine (BuPH2), did an NMR and it was an absolute mess, like 5 different things and we didn’t need it enough to want to distil it so we decided to kill it. Now I wasn’t the senior phd student and didn’t want to be involved in this so I was like “have fun with that, I’ll do the organimetallics” so I did those, then he did the phosphine and we decided to leave both buckets overnight.

He got in before me the next morning and accidentally flung the phosphine bucket down the drain... He dumped the bucket and then went to get his morning coffee (perhaps that was the mistake) I walked into the lab, and as soon as I opened the door ohh my fucking god, the smell was just horrific. I looked at the fumehood we’d been using for disposal and saw the organometallic bucket and immediately knew what had happened, went through to the office and said “do you know what you’ve done?” 

This was Friday at 9 am, we dumped a whole bottle of bleach down the drain, turned the tap on and waited a few hours... Still unbearable, more bleach and went home... Monday at 9 am, still disgusting but getting better. Wasn’t until Tuesday afternoon that the lab smelled normal again. 

Absolutely disgusting, after that we only did disposal in our groups other lab (where we didn’t work) but! Then we found out the issue with that, the fumehood outlets on the roof from that lab are right beside the air conditioning intake for the air con for the NMR room, server room and other things like that! So we we were killing thiols, phosphines and things like that, the smell went out on the roof and immediately back in and circulated round half the building :) of course our lab was as far from it as possible, so the safety guy comes storming in to blame the inorganic group for the fact the whole department stinks, and our lab smells normal, the whole floor smells normal, and he is so confused. Sees our pile of shit being disposed of and is like “has that been anywhere else” “moved from the smelly cupboard to that” then he went and sniffed around and figured out the smell was centred on air conditioned rooms, went to the roof and figured it out.

A PhD is different, if you do your research and come out the end with 2 good papers you’ve got a good PhD and it doesn’t matter where it came from or who the PI was. 

So because it’s about how you do in your research, you being happy being there makes more difference to your prospects at the end than the name of the institution on the but of paper at the end of it. 

The next thing is the PI, you need a PI you’re going to get along with, toxic PI student relationships always leave the student feeling like shit. Obviously they aren’t your best friend but make sure you can actually stand to have a meeting with them and they aren’t going to be actively shutting on you - this is something you should have assessed on the visit by asking people in other groups about things they’ve heard, other groups are infinitely more honest. 

But that’s less important than picking a PI who publishes in good journals! That’s pretty much just because of the experience and contacts it comes with, a big part of our world is networking and the more of it you can do effortlessly the better. If you were going purely on networking you’d pick a PI who is really rather established but they also often tend to be the least hands on - it depends what you like, if you need the PI involved to point and give advice regularly then go younger if you don’t like hand holding go older. I went for the latter, but there is no right or wrong and it is a generalisation - some older PIs are annoyingly hands on and some younger ones are very hands off. 

Now if you have absolutely no plan to go into academia then the big name university can have a benefit applying to industrial jobs. But I don’t think it’s worth sacrificing your mental health for a slight boost in an application for a job you may or may not want. Not going to a “top” university won’t disqualify you from those jobs, it just won’t make doors open as easily. 

But like I said the most important thing considering how mentally taxing a PhD is is to make sure you are going to be as happy as possible. That will make sure your work is the best it can be and will make everything work better.

chemistry,feeqmw6,t1_fdttitg,1579039145.0,"Talking about PhDs is not at all about departments! 

You apply directly to the supervisors (unless you go down the centre for doctoral training route) and it’s their decision if you get in or not. 

It’s a bit different from the USA which is what a lot of the advice on here is aimed at (they apply to department), that being said my advice is very because in the end you end up working for one person.

So my advice: first thing is to identify the area of chemistry you want to work in, then find some supervisors who do work you like the look of, see where they are working and decide if you’d be happy to spend 3.5-5 years there. 

Don’t go “ohh Oxbridge is where it’s at I’ll apply there!” they don’t always have the best people for every area and certainly not when you get down to subfields (they aren’t even better equipped than Imperial, Durham, St Andrews, Edinburgh, Bristol, Newcastle, Manchester, or Glasgow). 

I did my phd at one of that list and our departmental equipment (NMR, crystallography etc) was on par with oxbridge and in some areas just better. 

A phd is not about studying or passing exams it’s about doing research, as such it’s basically all on you! So if you’re happy you’ll get a great phd from a “bad” department and if you’re unhappy you’ll get a shit phd from a “great” department. 

The other thing about choosing a person over a place is, you won’t have thought about this but, academics can move and it isn’t uncommon! In my phd I think about 10% of the department turned over, people left and new people came in. Most of the people leaving were retiring, but some went to other universities - and all of the people joining came from other places with established research groups.

That means as a phd student you may end up having to move university, like I said it’s not common but it happens and if you go with an early career research is more likely - because if their good they’ll be offered higher ranking jobs at other places. 

Normally the phd students are offered a choice of move or stay, but stay is normally less appealing since no one in the department is likely to be able to help with their work. Moves within the UK are easy because 90% of students are EPSRC funded and they don’t care which university the money goes through.

We had one academic move to Germany and because the funding council aren’t going to pay for students in another country it was up to the receiving institution to pick up the funding, and they said they’d only fund 2 foreign students, lucky the group had a couple of Germans, so only 4 phd students had to remain behind and they were all on their last 18 months so no big deal. 

It isn’t worth worrying about and it shouldn’t factor into your decision (unless when you visit you hear rumours about the academic wanting to leave). 

That leads to open days, these aren’t like undergrad open days, if you get invited to a postgraduate open day by an academic you’ve almost certainly been accepted on paper - you’ll be introduced to the group and probably taken out for lunch by some senior members. This is your opportunity to not come across like a murderer or rapist, if you do that you’re probably fine! 

Make sure to talk to other people in the department, ask phd students from other groups about the group you’re applying to! They’ll always be more honest. People don’t like to admit their supervisor is a cunt, people in other groups are more than happy to tell you. 

That leads into the giving yourself time off thing, as a phd student treat it like a job, if you turn up at 9ish and leave at 5ish 5 days a week and occasionally work a weekend if you need to you’ll be fine. If your prospective supervisor is the type that doesn’t require weekend work or set hours but somehow all his students end up working 7-7 every day and 8-5 on a Sunday then that labs culture is awful and you should run as fast as your legs can carry you - this is why you need to ask subtle questions of the group, ask if they go out together at weekends, ask what there is to do around the place, and ask other groups straight about hours the group work - everyone always knows which groups work excessive hours. 

I am very much a work as little as is necessary to complete the task at hand kind of person, and thankfully I had a very hands off supervisor who just wanted to see results and didn’t care when I worked to get them. So I’m not the right person to ask if you’re totally different, but the advice I always give is, if it’s 5 pm and your reaction is just about to finish (unless it needs something done or it’ll die) leave it, go hole and pick it up in the morning. 

I essentially never started a reaction after 15:00 , doing very air sensitive inorganic meant if I started after 15:00 the reaction wouldn’t be up and running until 18:00, and fuck that. 

I came in somewhere between 8-10 normally, would work up anything I needed to and start the next reaction, I’d then run NMRs and then I’d have a break and spend the afternoon reading, chatting in the office, etc. If my reaction didn’t need babysat and I didn’t need human contact I’d just leave and go home, sit and do exactly the same thing but if I get bored I could throw on Netflix and relax. 

Same is true of days off, if you’ve been working flat out for weeks and you go in and no matter how hard you work you just seem to get nothing done, the chances are you’ve burnt yourself out! Have a long weekend. Or go in on the Friday but spend it catching up on analysis or reading rather than doing lab work, the day of doing something different will sort your brain out. 

——

Now, when did I start writing up my project, about 3 weeks before it was due to be honest... You should be (essentially) writing your experimental as you go along so that is already done. And then it’s just a little intro and a discussion. I would guess your department has a guideline or limit of somewhere between 10,000-15,000 words? It sounds like a lot but it’s not! 

70 days is probably 2-3 times more than you’ll ever need! I wrote my phd thesis in about 90 and I was dicking around pretty hard doing the intro, think the intro took me about a month and half and I did the rest of the thesis in remaining time. Intros for a phd are awful - great fun to write since it can be random and totally your style but really time consuming because of that, but for you at undergrad level they are essentially just a few thousand word essay on roughly the idea of your project. Honestly, it shouldn’t take you more than a week maybe two. And the results and discussion is universally viewed as a piece of piss, it’s literally writing down things you’ve already thought! Unless you’ve got a crazy amount of results you’ll be done with that again in a week to a week and half. 

So I’d plan to take 30-40 days to write up, but don’t be surprised if you finish up in half of that. Writing 1000 words a day is a great target, some days you’ll struggle to do it and others you’ll write 3000. 

Don’t be afraid in the first few days to just close the document and do something else. Or write a stupid nonsense story, I wrote a 600 word masterpiece about a chicken to get my final year project started. And my phd intro started with “what the fuck am I meant to write here?” And that remained the first line for about a week :) because I moved on and did a later part of the intro first because it needed less impact than an opening line. 

That’s another good bit of advice, you don’t have to write in order! In fact I wouldn’t recommend it! Do the results and discussion first, and then figure out what you need in an intro to make it understandable. 

That has a few benefits, it cuts down unneeded junk in your intro so it looks more crisp (and that gets better grades), and it also looks more like your project went to plan!

Also don’t be afraid to lie! That obviously doesn’t mean falsify results but if your project went off down a tangent it doesn’t hurt to pretend it was more planned than it was. Like if your project was initially synthesising some random thing to do testing on but along the way you found something else and it worked better, it doesn’t aleays need the rest of the story. 

Sometimes the story makes it work better, sometimes it doesn’t use your judgement but especially for big projects, you don’t need to write everything you did. Although for undergrad, I’d start by writing everything and see if phd students in the group think it’s too much. 

Anyway, I’m bored writing and I think I covered most of it, any other questions or anything I’ve missed either reply to this or PM and I’ll answer!

chemistry,fee2kdv,t3_eolpul,1579025075.0,"Yeah the stuff you learn in your first organic course absolutely could be solved by a computer :) but real life examples are much harder. 

Since an NMR spectrum doesn’t really constrain your structure all that much on its own it’s about what you’d call “chemical common sense” you could draw hundreds or thousands of molecules that would fit every proton spectra you’ve ever seen - but you know the right answer is something simple. 

Now in the real world we will also have, carbon NMR and 2d NMR spectra to constrain further but even still NMR is not a great technique (on its own) for assigning the structure of an absolutely unknown substance. 

If you fish some shit out of a cave fungus and want to know the structure, you’ll use NMR, mass spec and crystal structures (if possible) to get you your structure. 

In synthetic chemistry, we are more sure about what we’ve got (because we made it) so 90% of the time NMR is enough but people need other methods very often.

A computer solving NMR problems will do great at simple ones used in teaching and suggest nonsense for real world examples."

So now if you want a deal, you have no choice but to try and bring Trump to the table.

Iran isn’t going to make a deal with Europe while America is willing to kill Iranian political and military leaders - unless Europe is going to go to war with America over Iran.... Which obviously isn’t happening.

Trump is a cunt, but unfortunately because of him being a massive cunt in this situation there is no choice but to engage with him and try and get a deal as close to the original as possible with the word “Trump” on the front page.

worldnews,feanunq,t1_feaf4tj,1578950686.0,"Not the person you asked but the good Friday agreement sets out a pretty firm set of steps that are to be taken.

If there is a likely majority for reunification in Northern Ireland then a referendum will be called.

Then there is a vote on reunification in NI if that passes there is a vote in the Republic of Ireland. 

At the very least those 2 votes will take a year, then there is a bunch of negotiating to be done about how the hand over of powers from Westminster to Dublin will occur - see Hong Kong as an example of how this will probably go time wise. That took 3 years from 1982-1985 (hand over in 1997) I’d expect Ireland and the UK to sort it out faster but a couple of years is reasonable for negotiation.

Then you’ll have a transition period and a final hand over. 

It could easily be a decade after a vote that sovereignty actually changes - because rushing things in Northern Ireland doesn’t end well and isn’t in anyone’s interest. 

Now really I think it would be 5 years, but that assumes both votes actually provide a yes vote which is not a given. 

The people of Northern Ireland are far from certain to give consent to it. And in the event that they do, then the people of Ireland need to be asked - now if NI votes by a large margin to reunify then that vote is an absolute formality, but what if yes wins by 1 or 2% of the vote? 

Will the people of Ireland actually want a NI that is effectively totally spilt about what they want to be rammed into a union with them? 

That’s a totally open question, polling has obviously historically said the vote on RoI would be a formality but polls on “how would you vote if x were to happen” type questions are notoriously bad. 

So really nothing is certain about the political future of the island of Ireland and anyone who says otherwise is letting their bias do way too much of the talking. 

They could be reunified in 5 years or they could be separate for the next thousand years, you literally can’t tell.

And before anyone says brexit blah blah, have you seen politics in Northern Ireland? The colours on your favourite flag mean more than anything else. A lot of republicans would vote for reunification even if it meant they’d be poorer than Afghanistan and a lot of unionists are exactly the same but they’d vote for being part of the UK even if they would turn into Afghanistan. 

Northern Ireland doesn’t yet have a grown up political system, they still largely vote for political wings of terrorist organisations (on both sides) - and those positions have honestly got more entrenched in the last decade. 

As soon as Northern Ireland start voting in people for sensible issues like economics then it might start to function properly but until then it’s just an ideological war about which flag you prefer. 

Even as part of Ireland NI still has all the problems it has now they are just reversed."

Proper chemistry labs have a lot of engineering controls that make them almost amazingly more safe than a home environment.

Buildings used for labs to be made of plasterboard (drywall whatever you call it where you are) hung on steel - that’s a lot better than hung on wood like in a house. 

Modern ones also tend to have full blown firewalls - concrete walls between the lab and not the lab. 

It’s not uncommon for lab fumehoods to have automatic fire suppression systems. 

The floors in labs are made to resist the spread of fire. 

And that’s just fire... There is a lot more to it.

But above all else, in real labs there should always be someone else relatively near by who can help you if shit hits the fan. 

I probably saved the university I did my phd in from having a proper fire in my second ago because a phd student in the lab next door was working alone and managed to start a fire with a nitration and proceeded to panic and fail to do anything. Thankfully him shouting “ohh fuck it’s on fire” attracted my attention and as he ran out of the lab I took the fire extinguisher off the wall and put the fire out...

You might be able to get somewhere with Me3Si-N=S=N-SiMe3 this used to be commercially available and isn’t hard to make - I’m sure there must be a way on paper to turn that to the ketone. Although that’s not how it has been made (as far as I know anyway)."
chemistry,fe5otxl,t3_enveck,1578872384.0,"Not without an absurd amount of money no. And the equivalent knowledge of a chemistry degree.

The difficult bit of chemistry is analysis of results not mixing shit together - that bit is essentially cooking.

And I do air sensitive inorganic chemistry so I do just about the hardest practical chemistry it’s possible to do and it’s still just cooking...

Analysis, requires a lot of knowledge and a lot of equipment.

You want to discover things? It will depend on the area of chemistry but really you’ll need an NMR spectrometer, X-day diffractometer, mass spectrometer and a few other things.

Even buying cheaply that’s going to be a few hundred thousand dollars, plus about 20% of that a year for operating costs. 

To publish data (in a peer review journal and have it accepted by the scientific community) you need multiple pieces of evidence for your claim. 

So for example, to publish my most recent work (tbh all I’ve ever published) I provided the following data: NMR on 3 different nuclei, elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, infrared spectra, X-ray crystal structure, that is for everything I’ve ever published but for specific things I’ve needed more, so this last one I needed cyclic voltammetry, UV-Vis spectra, and a professor of theoretical chemistry to help with some quantum chemistry calculations. 

To actually do the experiments and make these things I probably used a few thousand dollars of consumables. But to analyse them I used the expertise of at least 3 people getting paid over 100,000 a year, and over a million worth of equipment.

What it is is a formal cessation of hostilities usually while negotiating a lasting peace. But not always, the Korean War ended in an armistice and legally North and South Korea are still at war.

Until the treaty of versailles was signed in June 2019 the war was not really over from the point of view the UK or France and so they maintained their advantageous position until that point.

That’s normal behaviour and not really “wrong” so it’s pretty disingenuous to criticise it.

Once the treaty was signed the blockade was lifted - so as soon as the war was formally over it stopped. We just view 1918 as the end of the First World War because the armistice and peace negotiations worked, that wasn’t a given.

I did not know why you were asking, so;

I don’t know that the measurement is actually what is important to you or do you just want to know how thick the glass of a burette is because maybe you want to make one? Maybe you are just a bit curious? Maybe you have no concept of how thick any glass is? 

Literally no way of knowing, so I opened with it doesn’t matter because the thickness of the glass of a burette has no effect on the function of that burette and I ended with “probably a couple of mm” because that is the answer for anyone a bit curious.

The doesn’t matter followed by thick enough to support its own weight thin enough to not weigh 3 kg tells you that it is a “how long is a piece of string” type question. One of the few questions that falls into the category of “stupid question”.

Because I don’t think someone could be so monumentally stupid as to ask the internet how big their own fucking burette was? 

Like, did you think there is a factory somewhere that makes every single one in existence? Do you think they are all identical and there are no manufacturing tolerances? We all just call up burettes-r-us when we need one and a magically created burette exactly the same as every other one appears? 

Yes burette are all calibrated but they are not standardised - that is all burettes with a volume of 100 mL have a volume of 100 mL but not all 100 mL burettes are physically identical.

It’s such a stupid question I couldn’t even imagine it was the question you were asking - yes asking about glass thickness of a burette is weird but actually I can think of reasons you might ask.

Maybe you wanted to put a burette under increased or decreased pressure? Then you’d need to know the glass thickness to know what your safe pressure differential is going to be.

Like I said, in future ask the question you want answered and say why.

If you had said “I need to know how thick the glass is because I have an equation I need to put that in” then I’d probably have banned you for asking a homework question which is against the rules - but in the ban PM I sent you I’d always have said “all burette a are different and you’ll have to measure the specific burette you used but it’s probably around 2-3 mm.”

It isn’t really true, if it was true the SNP would not use getting lots of votes at a UK election to try and have a referendum. 

Yes, absolutely voting for the SNP in and of itself will not cause independence - it will also require a vote for independence but a vote for the SNP is absolutely going to be taken as support for that and the outcome they wish. The same way a vote for the Conservatives is seen as a vote for brexit - but the SNP are far more the “independence party” than the conservatives are the brexit party.

Every other SNP policy is aimed at saying “look how much better it could be without those evil Westminster politicians” and has been since 2007. 

As a government they are a pretty broad church with members who are slightly right of centre to those who are really rather left wing.

As a party they are an even more broad church and the independence movement is even more broad all the way from communists to people more right wing than Rees-Mogg.

And 90% of those independence supporters vote SNP - why? Because of independence there is no other fundamental belief or policy in the movement or the party and barely any in the government. 

None of this is necessarily a negative, but pretending the SNP isn’t essentially a single issue party is very disingenuous and pretty much just spouting party talking points - something you wouldn’t do for any party you don’t support and you would call out people doing the same for a Conservative party line as well."

todayilearned,fdryn0j,t1_fdrras1,1578691712.0,"I got a good sleep once on a plane, I got flung into first class because unknown to me my friend was flying the plane! He knew I was going to be taking that route on the day but pure chance I ended up on his flight. 

As I go on the plane and show my ticket the cabin crew says “ohh I’ve been looking for you, come with me, your new seat is *blah*” - whatever it was 2A or something and walks me down there fucking otherworldly shit, this is proper first class on major international airline on an LAX to Heathrow flight - so not like domestic USA “ohh you get no one sat next to you” first class. 

Absolutely insane, felt so awkwardly out of place! But the rich people give you funny looks when the pilot comes and talks to you... Haha, they either thought “fucking crew taking up space in here” or “how important is this guy that the pilot is greeting him not the head of cabin crew?”. 

Anyway, turns out anyone can sleep in what was basically an actual bed on and airline. And the food was actually delicious as well. 

Favourite bit, the guy with his special plane pyjamas - not even kidding he calls over the cabin crew, who puts down his seat and makes his bed up while he goes to change into pyjamas in the toilet. I’m just say their unable to figure out if that is the height of ridiculousness or just using the service you’ve paid for to it’s full extent. 

Although, I felt a bit less weird about it when I went to put my bed down and the cabin crew came basically running out of the galley and sit “sir let me do this for you, you go into the galley and my colleague will get you a drink or just go for a walk and when you come back I’ll have this all ready for you” - I say I felt less weird, I felt less weirded out by what he had done but it was one of the weirdest experiences I’ve ever had, having this woman telling me to move so she could make my bed...

Pity I don’t own a small oil company so I can experience that more than once in my life, I feel like it was probably wasted on 25 year old me."
