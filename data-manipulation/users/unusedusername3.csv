FortCollins,ffnklfr,t1_ffn9zl9,1580067234.0,This actually makes a lot of sense to me. I'd love to see someone make a proposal for that.
FortCollins,ffg5g79,t3_et689l,1579898857.0,"The city, via the recreator runs basketball, volleyball and softball leagues. Often if you contact the coordinator they can help connect you with teams looking for players. Good luck!"

They were so delicious and their texture different, softer. I imagine they wouldn't travel well, but they were so good. We had some every day with breakfast and often again after dinner."
nottheonion,fetdmi0,t1_fesx7p4,1579374275.0,I'd sue for a lot more.
FIREyFemmes,fekup2b,t3_epl37g,1579207977.0,"FIRE is what you make of it. I donated regularly to causes I believed in when I was saving for FIRE. Now that I'm FIRE, I donate less (I also consume less), but I volunteer more. Also, I have free time to protest/rally etc. Follow your conscience and do what matters most to you."
EverythingScience,fdqolre,t1_fdqnlkb,1578671518.0,"Not at all a good analogy. Also, I didn't say anything about applauding them, I said convincing them. Nothing in my suggested reply applauded. I suggested politely giving information."
EverythingScience,fdqn6hl,t1_fdqlxyh,1578670623.0,"They said they are 90% vegetarian and this is what you have to say to them? This is NOT a good way to convince someone to go vegan. This is why people don't like vegans. 

> A lot of protein packed vegan options are not soy based though.

After this, you could have listed some of those options. Maybe then added which are your favorite or easily found in most supermarkets etc."
Foodforthought,fdo1tds,t1_fdncf2p,1578597330.0,I'm not so sure about that. But if he did he should've gone through a lawyer.
todayilearned,fdlnqxj,t1_fdllr2w,1578528204.0,"I've seen that way too many times. 

Some managers are just clueless. A manager did that to each of the 3 female employees working for him. He seemed perplexed when we all quit shortly thereafter. 

His boss was no better. There were rumors of layoffs. One of us had already left and the other two of us separately asked him to put us on the list. He didn't and didn't even ask us why. He also seemed surprised when we both took other jobs. Best career decision I every made."
todayilearned,fdkxpzt,t1_fdkutjk,1578513318.0,I think I must have worked in more dysfunctional work places that you. I have rarely had a manager give me useful actionable feedback. It's usually a check mark item for corporate. Though every good manager I've ever had told me well in advance of a performance review what I was doing well and what I needed to work on.
todayilearned,fdkwz87,t1_fdkpsvm,1578512882.0,Very good point!
todayilearned,fdko0pi,t1_fdkluxa,1578507559.0,Have you ever worked in a place with useful performance reviews? Fragging seems ... effective.
personalfinance,fdfoade,t3_el4ypi,1578366299.0,"Invest!!!

Your interest rate is super low. The general rule is less than 4% apr don't pay off early. That is because the money in the long term should do better the market than you'll save on interest. The main reason people ignore that advice is because the debt stresses them. Yours is so small compared with your annual income and you have a 2 income family. You should not worry at all.

You two make decent money and have small expenses (at least housing) you should check /r/financialindependence/

Also, as a fellow Coloradan (and I assume Front Range), I understand your housing situation and am in one somewhat similar. My husband and I have decided that we are either living in our house (smallish, but paid off) till we die or moving from here to some assisted living place when we can't live alone any more. Housing has gotten ridiculous."
Frugal,fcvfuyy,t1_fcv7c8g,1578001222.0,I believe you are correct. You can add a little compost or fertilizer to the water or replant outside after it takes inside.
todayilearned,fcrw2kt,t1_fcrv5gz,1577907407.0,I believe that's called a Pescetarian.
