If it's simple code formatting then run it through a lint like tool.

Look at their PRs and see what they're doing, if it's GIT then you should be able to look through the history.

Now if I have the USG setup it works for a bit except for one wired PC that doesn't seem to get an IP address or it does but DNS isn't handed out. If I setup static IP with DNS servers it's fine. Other clients seeemed to work fine but then I had a problem with clients (wired and wireless) losing their connections every minute and then getting them back.

I've fallen back to my ER5POE for now until I figure out what it is. My next step is to reset/unadopt the USG and delete and recreate the network in the controller. My best guess is that I have some weirdness with the DHCP/DNS settings in the controller.
