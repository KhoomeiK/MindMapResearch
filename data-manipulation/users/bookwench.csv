How can you possibly say it's irrelevant when you just gave me an example of you personally being treated differently by someone because you're a man? How can you ignore the fact that the world will always treat you one way, and women another way, and that's why kids look at this and say ""holy shit this sucks fuck that gender nonsense"" and rebel against that box? 

Women can never ever ever forget we're women. We're reminded of it every single day, in how we have to either play into it or fight against it every single moment of our lives we're around other people. In how we have to account for how men will act, how we have to determine if \*this\* man needs us to smile and laugh until we can get away or \*that\* man seems chill or this one's friendly and we can hang out but that one will, at work, while you're alone in the office, threaten your job or that one will scream in your face with spit flying everywhere because you disagreed with his assessment. That one likes to make jokes which are often genuinely funny but always *always* about boobs to see if you're a ""cool girl"" or not. This one will proudly tell all his friends you're a REAL comic fan, not like other girls, then ask you to perform feats of comic book memory like a performing circus monkey in front of strangers. That one walking past is looking sketchy too, last time a dude walked past that close they came over screaming about pussy and bitches, and you were in a group then which is the only reason he backed off and you didn't get into a fight with a crazy dude in a dark parking lot at Wendy's. This one stood in a group of men and spent a solid 10 minutes in the hallway talking about networking protocols while staring directly at your boobs, even leaning in for a closer look once. Nobody said anything, none of the other guys, and you were the only woman there. Every one of you tried to ignore it and you avoided talking to that man again even though he worked in the team next to yours. 

&#x200B;

I'm one of the lucky ones, honestly. The worst sexual assault I ever dealt with was just some old dude grabbing my ass as he stepped past me in a closed space at work. My sister in law and two of my nieces were raped at young ages. I'm middle class, older, and dress conservative, loose baggy clothing, never a hint of cleavage. When I got groped I was wearing a full BDU set and the dude had never once seen me in civilian clothing.

We can never stop the automatic calculations. The internal math. Never. We live with predators, and you are one of them. You might be a nice one who would never ever do anything to hurt women ever, like a sweet kind dog who has never ever bitten anyone and never would, but we cannot ever forget that you \*are\* one. You might be one we trust - you might be one who plays sweetly and only humps legs sometimes and guards instead of attacks -  but every woman not related to you looks at you and behind all the things she's thinking, so much ingrained she may not even realize it's math she's doing, she's calculating what she needs to do about you. Are you someone she can be alone with safely, or does she need someone else around to make sure you behave? If she feels the need to be in actual control of men to feel safe, are you someone she can proactively control with sex and get a leash on? Are you someone she needs to avoid? How much work does she have to do around you to be physically safe? What safety protocols does she need to run - keep phone near, leave the room, or can she relax? 

&#x200B;

Know what's funny? You've likely spent your whole life doing something similar around other men, mentally calculating if they're a threat to you and the people around you. Is this one a tweaker? Is this one someone I'm comfortable leaving my kids alone with or do I need to worry?

&#x200B;

And maybe you extend some of that to women too, consider them a threat sometimes too. But almost never a physical threat; that layer just isn't there, nine times out of ten.

This cites the observations of a stray rescue founder, discussing observed packs of dogs with stable structures long-term: https://www.salon.com/2012/01/14/the_secret_lives_of_feral_dogs/

And this contradicts that, with observations of dogs turned loose in Romania explicitly *not* forming packs: 
https://www.academyfordogtrainers.com/blog/are-dogs-pack-animals/

And then this contradicts that with first-person descriptions of dog packs in Detroit, where dogs are absolutely sharing sleeping space cooperatively a la gang territory, even if they're not actively hunting together: https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/city-of-strays-detroits-epidemic-of-50000-abandoned-dogs-238877/


There's a study which showed dogs were able, with some training, to perform cooperatively to obtain a reward:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3920030/

Circumstances might also influence behaviour; there was one discussion about how dogs in some areas who had been dumped some time ago were re-learning hunting behaviours, and the presence of dogs mirroring human behaviour for rewards indicated a specific type of neuron in their brains which was super interesting to some researcher (that was a podcast, they were so happy about it and I laughed). So if cooperation is something they can do which they are not being trained to do because it's not particularly easy for us - I mean, wolf packs do nothing *but* train for hunting, all the time, with all their play; I wouldn't discount the effect of pure learning on dogs."

Veggies are \*amazing\* once your brain gets used to the idea of eating them. Set yourself up for success on that one and plan ahead to make it happen, because if you leave it to the last moment you'll just eat whatever's easy and that'll never be veggies."
AskVet,fesua79,t3_eqicof,1579369053.0,"Ok. 

about the vet: if you have the option of going to a different vet, do so. Make sure you politely request a transfer of your pet's medical records to the new vet, and be clear about why you're doing this: you heard what they said about you, and you were hurt and don't feel comfortable seeing them anymore. Say it clearly, say it to the vet and the tech and the front desk people, and **only say it once**. Don't repeat yourself. Then leave. Don't go back for at least 6 months. 

Establish a polite relationship with the new vet from the start. Don't be overly friendly or overly hostile; treat them like someone you're doing business with. If you end up liking them a lot, that's awesome! Understand that it will be different from your old vet and you need to give yourself and your dog time to establish trust and comfort here. Make sure you talk to them about having some happy visits at low-traffic times: go in just for the chance to feed your dog treats and say hello, then leave. This will get both of you used to the new office and being calm about going there. 

Once you have a new vet, go to the specialist and have a courteous conversation with them  about the fact that you'll be switching your vet providers. Say you left the previous vet because they treated you in an unprofessional fashion and leave it at that. Absolutely do not elaborate or repeat on this, no matter how tempting it is to vent. Stay courteous with the specialist from the start. If they see that you're a good patient, then whatever commentary the other vet gave them will look like the other vet was being weird and in the wrong. Stick to your integrity. The other vet has damaged their reputation with you, and by extension, with the people who see you regularly and see that you're a good person to do business with.

IF you decide to go back to the old vet after some time away, and by no means are you obligated to give them another try! But if you feel they provide better care you might choose to go back. Remember: you should not expect everything to be friendly from the start. This is a medical professional's office where you are going because you feel they provide the best possible care for your dog, not your buddy's house or your friends, no matter how you felt before. You can be polite and courteous for the time you have to be there, as long as they can be the same. Bring your phone, read reddit, and you've got no obligation to smile at them no matter how sorry they are. Don't be rude, but you don't have to be happy, either."
