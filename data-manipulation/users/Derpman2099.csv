Rainbow6,fed11mp,t1_fed0ooc,1578993314.0,yes but that doesnt mean MORE people are buying the game every day. as the game gets older less and less people are going to be buying the game so they get less and less income from purchases of the game. not to mention price drops and discount. for a game to last and be supported for years on end you pretty much HAVE to have microtransactions to keep income flow consistent. not to mention players keep asking for more and more things to be added to the game which means they need more income to support development for it.
