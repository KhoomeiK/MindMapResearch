C_S_T,fc4va2r,t3_eg2twd,1577429827.0,"Desire is the root of all suffering. If you want to become something you are not here but there. Wanting to be free of suffering is a desire so you sufffer from that. This creates tension in the mind. If you are here without desire then the natural state of being is immediately here. The body will heal, the mind is free of tension. The key is in breathing and just being. Not becoming."
