politics,ffhb0sd,t1_ffh56w4,1579928409.0,"I support the gun restrictions in New York City but not the 3rd strike law using the gun laws as its justification. Two completely different things. 

Here's a real-life example where I supported an illegal gun owner in NYC: a guy from Florida drives to Manhattan to visit his girlfriend and takes a right on red, that's illegal in any of he 5 boroughs and a cop pulls him over. When he goes into his glove compartment to get his license and registration the officer sees he has a pistol, now he's in big shit o' trouble. 

The DA offers a plea agreement and the guy refuses, he wants a trial. In Manhattan. People are like, ""dude, you're looking at major time and you're crazy. Take the plea.""  He goes to trial and is acquitted. The jury believed there was no ill intent; he simply forgot he had the gun. The DA was \*pissed\* and issued a hissy fit statement stating as much. 

That's jury nullification. For all its flaws, the jury system is inherently a good idea, even if often poorly implemented. It ultimately believes in the goodwill of ""real"" people, for better or worse."
politics,ffh4wnu,t1_ffh4ckp,1579923204.0,"I've always wanted to try ""I would make an excellent juror, I can tell if someone is guilty just by looking at them!"" but never had the balls to actually do it."
AskOldPeople,ffh4p1m,t3_et876j,1579923039.0,"Actually, mostly the opposite in the NYC-area where I live. Many more birds (egrets, eagles, hawks,) deer, rabbits, and coyotes. Fewer raccoons and bats."
politics,ffh3h7n,t1_ffh0kno,1579922090.0,"Maybe you don't know your history; jury nullification is every citizens' right to overturn laws that are codified but jurors deem unjust. It's aligned with the checks and balances so dear to our country and is the citizens' ultimate check against tyranny. It's been validated and upheld by the Supreme Court. 

In the early 1800s, nullification was practiced in cases brought under the Alien and Sedition Act.  In the mid 1800s, northern juries practiced nullification in prosecutions brought against individuals accused of harboring slaves in violation of the Fugitive Slave Laws. And in the Prohibition Era of the 1930s, many juries practiced nullification in prosecutions brought against individuals accused of violating alcohol control laws.

More recent examples of nullification might include acquittals of ""mercy killers,"" including Dr. Jack Kevorkian, and minor drug offenders."
politics,ffgycqy,t1_ffgveyh,1579918221.0,"Okay, you're a gun rights advocate, I get it, I really do. I've lived outside this region and understand when and where they're appropriate and I absolutely will not get into a gun right's debate with you.

But I'm no automaton. I'm not bound to some simplistic algorithm to obey the law because it's the law. I've seen shit and understand other people have seen and lived different and worse shit. Sometimes people commit crimes and need to be removed from society. Sometimes they're treated unfairly for circumstances outside their control. This seems like it may have been one of those times."
politics,ffgue8h,t1_ffgteav,1579915312.0,"The judge couldn't divulge too many details of the case prior to the trial, but from what I could gather if you're in New York State and a felon on parole, and you're in a car with someone committing a crime, you're implicated by association. In this case, the other guy had an unlicensed pistol and this dude was simply in the car with him. Doesn't seem fair regardless of his prior criminal history that he would suffer the harsh consequences of a third strike felony.

So no, not inconsistent reasoning."
politics,ffgf8yt,t1_ffgd6af,1579904911.0,"The fact is lawyers don't want someone ""smart"" on their jury because they're prone to think critically and are not easily influenced, which is their job to do.

The defense threw me out, pretty sure I was racially profiled (middle-aged white guy) and he thought I would be hostile to his client. Whatever, every trial lawyer does it and it cuts both ways.

In my mind I was thinking ""jury nullification"" but had I even uttered those words it absolutely would have immediately created a giant shit show  that NOBODY wants in a courtroom (especially the judge.) Maybe there are extenuating circumstances that would have come out in the trial and convinced me otherwise but had it come down to it, I would probably have voted to acquit even though I'm pretty much in favor of most of NYC's strict gun control policies."

The Harvey Weinstein trial started, there's always fuckhead Trump looming around but all I got was voir diered for some poor dude who was looking at 30 years for a 3rd strike for being in a vehicle in which someone else held an unregistered pistol. I got off it."
