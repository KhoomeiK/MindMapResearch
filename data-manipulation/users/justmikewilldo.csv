We don’t need republicans to be convinced OF ANYTHING including that they are wrong.

We don’t need to convince democrats of anything either. We need to make our voices heard and feared. Through the exercise of our power, of which we have a tremendous amount if utilized. 

 Do you know how many humans we’re talking about if just half of that 53% got out and demanded justice? Or what the country would look like if they went on a work strike?

There is a very thin vale between millions of people and their power. 

We don’t need the republicans to approve. They won’t. Their ideology is so far from democracy we don’t want their approval. We don’t need them.  In fact, it’s become apparent to anyone looking that ‘republicanism’ is now a direct threat to freedom. They have declared a literal war on decency, equality, and democracy. 

We don’t need to show them they are wrong. We know they are wrong. 

There comes a time when you stop reasoning with the person trying to destroy you. The person fighting on behalf of a system that burns the world, that makes medicine too expensive, that puts gameshow hosts in the White House, that suppresses voters and clears voter registries, that gerrymandered the entire nation, that separates people on race, and class, and sexual preference, and gender. 

We don’t need them to agree with us. What we need, is to fucking stop them. 

When this impeachment raps up and Mitch and the Reps protect the most corrupt president in modern history, including Nixon, we don’t need to convince him he’s corrupt and a bad person. We don’t need the Fox viewers to “understand” they have been so OBVIOUSLY brain washed for decades. 

We need to be in the streets, by the millions. Full. Stop. The air traffic controllers stopped the government shutdown basically single handled almost over night. And that’s one fucking union. Imagine if 30-50 million people didn’t go to work tomorrow. Imagine if they didn’t leave the streets like they’re doing all over the world in places like HK. 

You can’t ignore the power of the people, if those people are choosing to use it.
