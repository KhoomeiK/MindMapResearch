As a kiwi fan it's impossible for me to understand if we're a good cricketing nation or not. We've played in the last two cricket WC finals but I feel that if we were to tour India, Aus or Eng right now we would be thoroughly embarrassed.

I enjoyed no gi ju jitsu bit I found the members at my particular club a bit too serious, they would talk about silly, white knight ideas like citizens arrest. Muay Thai is great but training with knees and elbows can be taxing on the body.

After 2006 I trained in kickboxing and had 6 fights in WAKO kickboxing. My record is 4-1-1. I started boxing in London in 2011 and continue where I now live in Australia. I have participated in a handful of blue collar boxing matches.
