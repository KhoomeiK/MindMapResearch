**Q13. If I am hired through Schedule A, can I be converted to the competitive service?**

>**A13:** Yes. When you are hired through Schedule A, you are in what is called the ""Excepted Service."" You can be converted to the ""Competitive Service"" when you meet the following criteria:  
You complete 2 or more years of satisfactory service without a break of more than 30 days, under a non-temporary Schedule A appointment;  
You are recommended for conversion by your supervisor;  
You meet all requirements and conditions governing career and career-conditional appointment except those requirements concerning competitive selection; and  
You are converted without a break in service of one workday

**Q14. Is conversion to a career or career-conditional appointment mandatory after two years on a Schedule A appointment under 5 CFR 213.3102(u)?**

>**A14.** No, conversion to a career or career-conditional appointment is not mandatory. The hiring agency maintains the discretion to determine whether an employee is ready for placement in the permanent career workforce. The agency is not required to convert an individual on the 5 CFR 213.3102(u) appointing authority; however, the intent of Executive Orders 12125 and 13124 concerning employment of persons with intellectual disabilities, severe physical disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities is to permit these individuals to obtain ""civil service competitive status."" Civil service competitive status is obtained through conversion to the competitive service, rather than remaining in the excepted service."
