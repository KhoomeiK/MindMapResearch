BPDlovedones,femigeb,t1_feeyx7f,1579257235.0,"She's pregnant, his family hates her (no kidding), she is 9 years older than him, annnnd she def got preganant on purpose bc i found out she went off her bc in summer!! He was just the first guy she suckered in. Her mom thinks a baby will fix her. She's already clingy to the baby, crying over it leaving its basinet (uhh she is 6 weeks along) and she blames her rages now on pregnancy hormones!!  

I'm going to call cps when this baby is born."
BPD,fdw0yyo,t1_fds989f,1578753912.0,"No, i can't talk to her like everyone else, because she has a lot more triggers than the average person"
BPD,fdw0vle,t1_fds8xaf,1578753874.0,"Okay, thank you."
BPD,fds88yf,t1_fds2jtv,1578696594.0,"I'm looking for more specific advice, this is all helpful but also really general"
BPD,fds85z5,t1_fdr85c6,1578696540.0,"That all makes sense, but I guess I'm worried about a child having to navigate that? And I don't really know what to say when she is angry bc a lot of the times I honestly can't pinpoint what set her off and she's not able to verbalize it in a mature way that I can understand. So the result is everyone just tries not to set her off, but something usually does anyways. I'm sure me trying to talk to her about the reality of being a mother will be read as an attack, and I wasn't sure if there was a way to word it so that it will come off as supportive (which is what it's meant to be) but also letting her know ""hey you need help and we're here for you as you get it."""
BPD,fdqghb3,t1_fdqb79h,1578666065.0,"I am her SIL, meaning i did not grow up with her. I have not chronically invalidated her or responsible for her having BPD. 

I'm looking for a way to have a productive conversation with her, specifically about her pregnancy, not be her therapist and work through her childhood trauma/fix the abusive family dynamic for her. Trying to do that would hardly be a show of healthy boundaries nor would it be appropriate."
BPD,fdqaetg,t1_fdq5xb1,1578661098.0,"She is not married. She's been dating a guy on and off for a month, they've had two explosive break ups so far. 

Her brother is out of state. Like across the country. 

I do not see her often. I honestly try to limit contact with her. 

What you're suggesting *is* enabling though; everyone else changing but she not changing a thing. That's enabling and not what I am looking for. I am open to changing the way i interact with her (although I feel that my therapist has guided me pretty well in adhering to the standards you alid out) but that doesn't help the child or get her the help she needs. I'm going to have a conversation with her, but I'm looking for ways to phrase it that would be helpful and effective not attacking. Idc who she was/is now what matters to me is that she gets the resources needed to be a good mother."
BPD,fdq4ifq,t1_fdpmv98,1578654466.0,"Sounds like you're advocating that i enable/ignore abusive behavior. I'm not sitting there and calmly finding her keys as she screams at me and starts throwing items. I would leave. And that is most certainly not a situation i want to see my niece/nephew in ever. She needs a therapist to help her learn to manage anger, not family members.

And no one has told her directly she needs help really. Everyone just tries to not set her off. But that's no environment for a child to grow up in and at this point, something needs to be said. I'm looking for thoughtful and effective ways to approach her about this."
BPD,fdq4es9,t1_fdpcui0,1578654329.0,"I'm not her ""carer"" though? She's 32 years old and is about to become a ""carer"" for someone else. This is the type of stuff she needs to learn, just not realistic for me to teach her this stuff."
BPD,fdpauq2,t1_fdpajf9,1578624047.0,Non-judgmental about abusive behavior? Validating of her behaving abusively? The rest make sense but I'm not sure what to make of your first point.
BPD,fdp9kzj,t1_fdp9cwi,1578623195.0,"SIL. The mom is part of the problem. The family system as a whole is very abusive. And if you try to set a boundary, she becomes enraged. I really am at a loss of what to do here."

writing,fdl4eb4,t3_eltxe2,1578516855.0,Writing is re-writing. You're not gonna spin gold on a first draft. You're just not.
writing,fdl3tjf,t3_elvty5,1578516577.0,"I think fleshing out your character by doing one of those character questionnaires online and doing a RPG as that character could help. Being able to embody another character is really more practice than anything else. Lay out a scenario and explain how each character would approach the situation. 

When it comes to big philosophical or moral positions, perhaps avoid dealing with big issues with characters and having them spell out their thoughts on, say, human existence or whether people are naturally good or bad or if there is any such thing as a selfless act or the nature of mental illness....its hard not to have long monologues on these subjects come across as though the character is a spoke piece for the author. 

Keep it simple and keep the characters thoughts and emotions directly relevant to the plot and their life. Besides, your characters should be having so many obstacles/crises/conflicts that there shouldn't be too much time for them to dwell on philosophy or other abstract subjects."
writing,fdl3216,t3_eltwlo,1578516210.0,You would have to use emotions and body language to convey urgency and tension. Or split them up so it's just your pov character by themselves. It would definitely make the stakes higher
BPDlovedones,fdkz9td,t1_fdf5f7u,1578514236.0,"I think everyone is a whole person, even if they don't feel it all the time."
BPDlovedones,fcnf4qb,t1_fcha5kq,1577810438.0,Yeah but someone who grew up in an abusive household has 'fleas' and other dysfunctional behaviors so they have half of the problem. Relationships take 2 people.

BPDlovedones,fcnex78,t1_fck1yc1,1577810321.0,So BPD is a spectrum disorder. People here have seen the worst of it. Not everyone with BPD is as severe as what is being described here.
BPDlovedones,fcnepfx,t3_ehio03,1577810187.0,"Is she in treatment? That is the most essential question here. 

All i can say is proceed carefully and trust your gut, but also don't see everything as stemming from her BPD. She's still a whole person. 

I think it would be helpful to make a list of your boundaries and dealbreakers and keep them to yourself. Every time she breaks one, give her a warning/talk to her and then note it. After 2 warnings, time to re evaulate the relationship."
BPDlovedones,fcne764,t3_ehvtq0,1577809857.0,"Ask for an Emergency dose.

I've been trying to meal prep, that depends on if there are dishes clean/soap/sponges available. So i like to have a back up in case.

GetMotivated,fc7av9v,t1_fc78r0e,1577502151.0,"It is, but your original comments make it sound like they call the cops on you literally out of nowhere. They need to reasonably suspect you are in danger or a danger to others at that moment.

And veing on drugs wouldn't be enough in and of itself. It would have to seem like you were overodsing or had intent to."
GetMotivated,fc7894a,t1_fc752ye,1577500155.0,"They would have to be acting in a way on the phone that says they're on drugs (like talking incoherently, or being unresponsive, slurring words,  for example)"
GetMotivated,fc6w1vq,t1_fc6r9z4,1577490970.0,"If you were inconsolable on the phone and seemed in crisis, like so panicked that you can't communicate, then I can see why she would be concerned."
GetMotivated,fc6vvnz,t1_fc6lucj,1577490841.0,"Ok, I'm not saying there are no issues. I'm saying that locking people up without cause is not one of them."
GetMotivated,fc6iqfr,t1_fc6h08m,1577481539.0,"No, we are not. You have to literally tell us that you want to harm yourself or others and have a plan and have the weapons/equipment needed to enact that plan. There is no room for interpretation whatsoever. Also, we are required to report each call to a supervisor. So multiple people are involved in the decision to call the police.

You are vastly misinformed and it's concerning you're spreading this misinformation. Someone may really need this help and not call bc of what you are saying."
GetMotivated,fc6ewbh,t1_fc6doys,1577478939.0,But in order to be held you need to have a suicidal/homicidal plan and admit to that. You're missing that key peice of information.
GetMotivated,fc6cmhb,t1_fc6c5yj,1577477431.0,"As someone who was held for 3 days, i do get what you are saying, i really do. But it's not helpful to spread inaccurate info that by simply calling you can be locked up bc it will scare people off from seeking help they may really need."
GetMotivated,fc6c3it,t1_fc65bn0,1577477097.0,"As someone who has been through the ""system"" as well as worked as a a hotline counselor, i understand there are a lot of issues with our mental health system.

GetMotivated,fc6bu6v,t1_fc65nw2,1577476928.0,But what do they need before they can hold someone for three days? There's a whole other sentence you left out.
GetMotivated,fc5s1je,t1_fc5pfj0,1577464596.0,"This would require multiple people to be bad at their job though. Hotline counselors have to report to superiors, they're not just given free reign to call the police whenever."
GetMotivated,fc5o5fm,t1_fc5cl3e,1577462463.0,"people who are mentally ill/on drugs/psychotic (the pple who are often involuntarily hospitalized) often have memory issues, usually due to dissociation.

If someone has expressed intent to harm themselves or others and has the means to do so, then they will be held against their will, but only for 3 days. To be held longer, the state has to bring them to court.

But no, you cannot just be thrown in a mental ward for just calling up to talk about being stressed about a job interview."
GetMotivated,fc5o0t4,t1_fc5kxkm,1577462392.0,"I'm not sure about outside the U.S. but the protocol in the United states is to only report to the police if the person expresses desire/intent to harm themselves or others *and has the means to do so* meaning we would ask ""do you have access to any weapons?"" Etc. 

The police would need adequate evidence to hold you past a few hours. They can't just throw you in a psych ward for no reason."
GetMotivated,fc5nhq2,t1_fc5naq1,1577462096.0,"That is most likely what happened because otherwise the crisis counselor and police officers actions would be extremely illegal. And like you said, we get so many calls, it would be a waste of time to track someone down unless it was necessary."
GetMotivated,fc5nbkf,t1_fc5n2d1,1577462003.0,Thank you for backing me up. I wouldn't want someone to be scared off from calling when they really need help due to inaccurate information.
GetMotivated,fc5n552,t1_fc5h6bc,1577461913.0,Right so you have a history of self harm then...so that would be considered evidence...
GetMotivated,fc5dey8,t1_fc5cl3e,1577454188.0,All I can tell you is how we're trained to respond and what the law is. It's fairly difficult to hold someone against their will if they will not admit to being suicidal and there is no evidence of them being a danger to themselves or others.
GetMotivated,fc5anev,t1_fc4yba7,1577451253.0,"Yeah...I've worked at a crisis hotline. This is either not real/leaving out very important details (most likely) or both the cop *and* the hotline counselor were terrible at their jobs to the point of breaking the law...

The only way they would ever send the cops to your address is if you expressed an active suicide/homicide plan with means to execute. Cops can only do a ""wellness check"" they can't arrest you for suicidality and hold you without proof."

BPDlovedones,fc46in9,t1_fc3oaf8,1577407945.0,"Yeah, that's very invalidating.  You have every right to not respond, or to set a boundary by saying ""wow that is veey invalidating. Me and my kids were affected by the fight between you and mom."" And then if she escalates, distance yourself."
