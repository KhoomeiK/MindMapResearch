Then she changed job so it was no longer near work or home and it just wasn't making sense to pay so much for a gym so far away (and we were married by this point too so she was stuck with me and my quickly-softening body haha).

A quick list off the top of my head:

* Lots of modern, well-maintained equipment

* As many towels as you need (I joined Gymbox on their ""membership with towels"" but that just means they give you one solitary small towel when you walk in and that was meant to serve you on the gym floor as well as post-shower... urgh)

* Big lockers, well laid out and with electronic locks (no need to take a padlock)

* Fancy products in the change rooms, inc. an iron/ironing board and (apparently) hair dryers and straighteners in the ladies

* It might sound a bit snobby but as the price was higher than average, the people who used the gym just seemed a bit more pleasant with each other, more respectful of the equipment, more polite to other users etc

* We used to usually go early (when it opened at 6am) and there was never a wait for equipment etc"
