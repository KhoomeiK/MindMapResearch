I don't know but it may be good to find someone who loves you both back without minding the son of another woman (there are people who don't want to give birth due the pain but also don't mind to raise others child as their own one).

ITCareerQuestions,fe38x0u,t3_enj0g7,1578847083.0,"You are a cog: if you perform bad you get replaced, if you are underperforming but still good could some extra fees as maintenance (raise, paid extra hours) to keep you there, as long as no replacement is needed yet. The company will survive even without you, any business that shut down because one key employee leaves, it's not a sustainable business. They keep company understaffed because that is where they profit the most, in other words, squeeze the soul out of the existing team.
You are burning out, if not already. When you start feeling happy on Friday night and dread on Monday,it's a big red flag, considering that you love your workplace and this job is your passion. Please take care of yourself, I've got burnout few times in my IT life and everytime took me at least 2-5 months of total rest (living on savings and slowly start doing something when finished all my savings ) but my last time is longer than 6 months and this sucks."

Everything is a grey zone here, nobody knows how much you have to pay; if they knew, they would have directly asked you but things are more complicated and it's all about estimations and even fines are also variable and negotiable."

In 1995 women constituted an estimated 70 percent of Russia's unemployed, and as much as 90 percent in some areas."" referring to the 1990s. Things are changing and I am glad of it but still there's some ""tradition"", stigma behind those thing that are not yet totally cancelled.
Also your age range is 15-64, which it means that doesn't consider only the ones who have kids. I have a 5 months old and we both (me and my wife) had to stop working to take care of it, I really kudos those who can handle it as single/solo caregiver."

Simple as that. You must be aware of which expenses are allowed to claim, this is what kept me not from using them yet because I couldn't claim car leasing, rent (home office) as those thing must be registered or located in Estonia to be claimable.

What do you need lawyers for? I guess that's something you have to figure by yourself as everybody's case is different. They have a very friendly customer support, just send an email and they will get in touch with you for any doubt."

To get in NTA you should have refused the free coffee and paid by yourself, so let the people behind you receive the benefit (like skipping you although you are breaking the streak), or the cashier propose you to pay forward a coffee for the customer behind you, so you end up receiving a free coffee while paying forward for a coffee (you don't earn and lose anything, because if you didn't have someone pay forward for you, you had to pay by yourself anyway)."
