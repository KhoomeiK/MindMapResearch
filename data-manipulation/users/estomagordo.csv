Now he has left the city long ago, because the English premiership is nothing compared to the major leagues. He has a statue erected outside of anfield, solidifying his icon status.

hockey,fcuzswr,t1_fcuzjrh,1577991770.0,1) Not rooting for or against either team in that game. 2) Not being able to handle disappointment to the point where you physically assault others is a huge character flaw. 3) The NHL has had international fans for decades.
