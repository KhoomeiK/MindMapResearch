exmuslim,fdsam94,t1_fdryi8y,1578698200.0,"Hun. The mental prisons we make for ourselves. People dont understand why we dont just leave. I do wish i had my clarity earlier, but it is what it is. The day I left him, I cried and cried. I instantly thought, fuck, I did the wrong thing. This was the wrong thing. I couldnt feel anything but guilt and fear. But very shortly after... I began to bask in the freedom. And things fell into place. He told me he would change so he could get me back, but it was too late. I was free and i was never going to risk that again. I was lucky I had so much support. But I didnt know I had that until I finally tried. I wish i lived near you so i could help you. But i know if you ask, people will be more than willing to help.

When you are ready you are ready. PM me anytime, ok? And if you do decide to plan your escape, stay safe."
exmuslim,fdrvrcl,t1_fdru4hl,1578690453.0,"Girl. My husband pulled that same shit. First of all he didnt legally marry me, just did a nikkah, and i had to find out from his mother that he was already married to someone else. 


Also he claimed he was vehemently against porn, but then I found out that he watches it nightly. I wasnt gonna say anything. But then one day I said something to the effect of ""shorts are cool"". He told me how terrible I was for saying such a thing. I was a hijabi at the time, I didnt wear shorts anymore. But he said clearly if youre saying an item of clothing that exposes khafirs skin is cool, then you clearly have a bad relationship with Allah and your soul is in danger of hellfire.

Well i was fucking livid. This god damn hypocrite telling me my soul is in danger while he is looking at porn and thinks I dont know. Thats when I told him i knew. And that was our biggest fight. He pushed me and snatched our daughter and almost left with her.

I used to feel stuck too. I couldnt drive, I didnt know where i would go if I left. But I reached out to several close friends and family. My sister bought me a secret track phone so that I could comminicate safely, since he checks my regular phone. I didnt think i could ever get out but my friends and family helped me come up with a plan. I hope you have close friends around. Or even a womens shelter or someone who helps women being mistreated. I didnt tell any muslims because I figured they would just tell me to work it out. But after that bad fight i knew I couldnt work it out.

Sister you know you deserve better. Please confide in someone and try to find a way out. Please dont worry about his feelings. You need to worry about your kids. I guess im very emotional about your situation because its so similar to what i went through, with the porn and the threats and the lying about marriage, and I felt so helpless until I reached out.

Edit: Ugh I'm just remembering the dark times. My darkest was when i thought I was so stuck, that the only way i could get out was if he died. I used to kind of hope he would get in a car crash on his way back from work because I was just so lost and hopeless. Can you relate to that at all or is that really fucked up? I mean i didnt really wish that but thats where my mind would often go."

exmuslim,fdrqtdd,t1_fdrp3hm,1578688219.0,"I dont know. I guess my ex husband was a huge liar and a narcassist and he was always making me feel horrible and scared, screaming and insulting me in front of my daughter. I ultimately decided that I didnt want my daughter seeing that and growing up and thinking that was okay. I dont know how your husband treats you, but threatening to take your kids is really serious. I know you feel bad for him, but he is scaring you. He has no right to do that.

What if that was happening to your kids when they were older? What would you say to them? Thats how I thought of it... When I consideded staying and not breaking the family up, I thought, if my daughter came to me and said this very thing was happening to her, I wouldnt tell her to stay. I would help her leave.

I know our situations arent the same. Maybe if you told him that the threat of him taking your kids scares you, he would listen. But when i told my husband that, he said if he took them I would have no one to blame but myself. So if that doesnt work i would consider reaching out to someone, or many people.

Im sorry youre going through this. It's terrifying."
