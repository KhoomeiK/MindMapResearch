In the area I live it’s considered animal cruelty to leave a pet out in the elements. A plastic dog house will not protect a dog or cat from freezing to death. At the school I went to this stray momma cat had kittens under a portable, and when winter came around I begged my parents to go get them and provide them some place warm, by the time I convinced them they had all frozen to death. A momma cat surrounded by her frozen kittens is an awful thing to see and it happens all the time. I am very happy you noticed that cat was being neglected and provided a safe place for it."

Get a rifle and start practicing, .223 is a great round and that’s probably what I would tell someone to start off with if they aren’t interested in a rimfire round. I am not trying to discourage you’re thirst for knowledge when it comes to external ballistics, I think that’s awesome, but if you are planning on only shooting out to a few hundred yards I would focus more on learning to how sight in a scope, zero a rifle, and how to shoot it. If you fall in love and decide you want to upgrade to a long range platform and start hitting steel at a 1000 yards then you need to learn the math and science of long range shooting. There are so many factors at long range that need to be considered, the wind, mirage on zero, light, temperature, humidity the list goes on and on.

As for the table top I generally like to use a 3/4” Baltic birch and then a layer of 1/8 hardboard on top that I can easily remove when it becomes ugly over time. If you’re not planning on getting greasy and beating it up you should be fine with a 3/4” piece of Baltic birch. You can make the legs and everything from Baltic birch if you’re worried about using rough lumber without a jointer/planer. PaskMakes on YouTube is an awesome guy and he has a video where he makes a very sturdy beautiful workbench all out of plywood. You can always put levelers on your table saw to dial in the perfect height and level to make it flush with your bench once it gets set into the cubby you plan on making, would be the easiest way."
