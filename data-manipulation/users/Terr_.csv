**Protip:** It is possible to craft and own lots of Override Frequencies at once. This trick involves having your Consumeables full of items, so that additional Override Frequencies go into the *postmaster.*

1. This allows you to craft a lot at once while standing in a good spot (see next tip)
2. While you can still only ""carry"" one at a time, once you spend it external apps like [DIM](http://app.destinyitemmanager.com/) will allow you to instantly grab a replacement from the postmaster, allowing you to pick whichever postmaster-held frequency is most-convenient.

**Protip:** If you're looking to get 40/40 nodes (i.e. to open nodes you haven't opened before) your location when combining Stems matters: It will generate a random frequency for somewhere that **isn't** in your same general area. You can use [other people's tests](http://i.prntscr.com/9jH4Sd_DTembqzkmzEiFRQ.png) to maximize your chances of getting a ""new"" node.
