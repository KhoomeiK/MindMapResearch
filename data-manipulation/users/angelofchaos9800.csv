Though I know you probably already know where this is going, let me confirm. Yes, it was sexual. Yes, it was up my vagina. Yes, it got stuck because I pushed it in too far. No, I did not go to the doctor nor did I have to as it did come out about an hour later, but damn that was an awkward family dinner. No, I did not learn from this as I did it again a few years later. I still have the rock. It is sitting with the rest of my dildos. I have very few regrets other than the embarrassment at telling my fiancee I had a rock stuck in my vagina."

In middle school, she picked up a hat that had gotten tossed in with some of the playground balls, thinking it belonged to one of her friends.

So, she does and they go back inside from recess, thinking nothing else of it. 

A little while later, she is called into the office and freaking suspended because they ""have her on camera stealing and hiding another student's hat."" They camera footage was like the 2 seconds of her tossing the hat back with the balls. Even my parents were incredulous as to wtf was going on and they looked for any reason to abuse us. The security lady hated my sister for no reason (my sister may be sarcastic and witty, but there were kids doing weed in the bathrooms, so I think she had other concerns) so that might have been part of it.
