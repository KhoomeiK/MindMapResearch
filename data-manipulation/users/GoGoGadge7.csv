Your son is lucky to have a father like you. 

Honestly... I think you handled this great and the awkwardness is going to wear off soon. I mean, your sons coming out moment was you walking in on him and his boyfriend. Thatâ€™s a tad rough but youâ€™ve handled it great in my, and apparently everyone else whoâ€™s not a raging homophobe, opinion. 

Bravo."

Montasy is absolute trash. Not the people, but the structure. 

The Uncommons is fine as long as you like NYU kids and craft beers. 

Good Games NYC.. formally known as The Geekery at one point, is INCREDIBLE! The prize pay out is fantastic. Ownership and community are amazing!
