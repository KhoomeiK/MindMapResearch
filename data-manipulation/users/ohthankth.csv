aww,ffp9n5u,t1_ffiaovf,1580089617.0,I see what you’re saying I was just wondering how you could be confused it if wasn’t original content. It’s a very cute video
worldnews,ffnft9t,t1_ffn3lgh,1580065355.0,"So I’m not sure what the correct ways to handle the scenarios were, but they told me they liked my answers so maybe they were ok. 

For the flat earther I calmly asked for the book back, and explained that those books belong to everyone to enjoy and learn from. That other people wont be able to look at the book if it’s ruined and that defacing books could get him removed if it continued. I offered to show him how to use the computers if he wanted to do further research, and explained that we would have to keep a close eye on him until he demonstrates that he won’t damage any more books. 

Anti vax I explained that we currently didn’t have any literature discussing the dangers of vaccines. But, I told her there were books from universities discussing the benefits of vaccines near the non fiction books in case she wanted to read a different point of view. 

I ended up taking a different job, so I don’t have any actual stories but it seemed like if that was in the interview it was clearly a common occurance. I would LOVE to hear some of your Barnes and Noble stories! Also did you guys get a discount?"
worldnews,ffmxb7m,t1_fflj2ej,1580059842.0,"I remember in an interview for a library assistant we role played. What were the scenarios? A man defacing a book because he was a flat earther, a woman asking about anti vax books and a man being scared of all the homeless people outside of the building asking me to tell them to go away."
animalsdoingstuff,ffi9ujo,t1_ffhpn6v,1579968773.0,Thank you for your comment.
aww,ffi9lra,t1_ffhiwm9,1579968601.0,Incredible that you know that!! How’s your dad that is definitely your dad doing?
aww,ffi9j7a,t1_ffhxvl3,1579968550.0,"if it’s not your original content, then you saw it somewhere else. How would you have this video if it WASN’T a repost lol."
AskMen,ffi97yi,t1_ffh9z56,1579968335.0,"I genuinely do not understand how this show demonstrates awareness. I think the only thing that was realistic was Hannah’s rape scene. But the rest felt like suicide is a vindictive move and a way to be memorialized instead of the reality that it is a last resort action taken as a means of gaining control and ending suffering. Hannah was FINE. She had bad days, but even in her POV she wasn’t suicidal. Suicidal ideation builds and is long lasting. The whole show was not, in my experience, a remotely accurate portrayal of suicide. I was thinking that maaaaybe if she had a different mental illness it would be more accurate, but there is no evidence of this. She was a girl who had some very crappy days (before the rape). But she had a support system and no evidence of mental illness. Suicide very very rarely happens like that."
AskMen,ffi8rho,t1_ffhavs2,1579968010.0,"Look man, I have a lot of fundamental grievances with the show. But I think you’re missing the point. 

A filming location is chosen for aesthetics, not because the people or place are an actual representation of the subject matter. My state is the filming location of a plethora of Disney properties. No one assumes I’m going to bust into song and dance because I grew up near High School Musical’s filming locations."

It has failed at every turn. But yeah, boomers bad, lol!!!"

AskMen,ffh1z80,t1_ffg0u24,1579920948.0,I’d argue that 13 reasons why S1 was not displaying awareness by any stretch. It was pretty addictive and interesting.
AmItheAsshole,ffeae1v,t1_ffe9fjt,1579841178.0,"Reading your comment made me research some more. The US teaches educators some things at dyslexia that may very well be myths at this point. I think a lot of what I learned was false information. There’s still a lot of stigma and we often would defer to SPED for accommodations. I believe your comment could very well explain why he spells the way he does. He also probably (hopefully) uses some proofing system while working. 

I appreciate your perspective and expertise. Thank you for educated the miseducated :)"

MUAontheCheap,ff55sca,t1_ff4nuae,1579581033.0,Was your scalp oily? I have literally spent a year experimenting with washing less and my hair never “adjusted” like everyone says it will. If I don’t wash it everyday my hair is a disgusting grease trap. I’m kind of desperate to wash less.

millionairemakers,fepcrug,t3_eq81a8,1579317337.0,Happy New Year! Man I just want to pay off my student loans and get training lessons for my dog. And take my mom out for some Moscato. She got out of a religion and is now exploring the world of alcohol. And she reaaaallly likes Moscato. Teaching a 72 year old woman to drink responsibly is pretty funny
