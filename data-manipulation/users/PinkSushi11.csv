JustNoSO,ffi6xsf,t3_etfvdh,1579966704.0,"What a disgusting thing to say to somebody. I don't know what to tell you as far as moving forward but he does sound like an asshole. I'm sorry he said that to you. I hope the best for you, it sounds like this is going to be one heck of a ride with your man child."
pastlives,ffh552e,t3_etkyud,1579923385.0,"Yes, it's definitely possible. 



I get this feeling with some people in my life too. There's a guy that I sleep by from time to time and absolutely love it because my connection with him feels so deep - like I've known him for many lives."
Mediums,ffgdnfg,t1_ffgcofp,1579903910.0,You described this perfectly and much better than I did!
Mediums,ffgdl1p,t3_etgxvx,1579903869.0,"Yes, they are real and yes they can speak to those who have passed on. They get the information from thoughts in their head. It's hard to describe, sometimes the information comes as thoughts and other times they can have a full on conversation with someone on the other side. I can't really describe it accurately but it's all done in their head."
Advice,ffdj22y,t1_ffd3qrv,1579821918.0,Best advice here. Make it a hard slap too. Cya.
AskReddit,ffdid2s,t1_ffcuo5x,1579821498.0,Those my friend are called whores.
Psychic,ffd9ydi,t3_esyup7,1579816331.0,"I do believe you have an ability and I think you can enhance it. I don't have words like, ""bad - uncle - hurt - mom"" go through my head, what I would have instead is a gut feeling that my uncle abused my mother and I would possibly know what sort of abuse and details I shouldn't know. I think that you are in the early stages of developing your ability and working with it could really help you tune in a little more. 


Also, your vision could have been about your cousins fiance but still could have been about your boyfriend. However, it also may be avoided now. I was sleeping next to a guy and had a very real dream that he got into a fatal car accident and since I dream a lot of things that do come true I immediately told him upon waking up so that he could be careful and avoid this. Once you get to the point of trusting your gut I would share your visions with those around you, including your boyfriend. Sometimes it's nice to be validated. However, do not share it with anyone that you think will call you crazy. Just close people like your boyfriend, maybe your mother and of course we love hearing stories here too! Good luck and I hope to read more stories from you."
Mediums,ffd0x84,t1_ffba2fm,1579811242.0,"I wish you could contact them too, feedback like this is so important sometimes! Also, I'm really sorry to hear about your sister. That's so young to get the early onset of dementia. How is she doing now? My heart breaks for her and for you."
NarcissisticAbuse,ffcu0o8,t3_eswx71,1579807239.0,"No. Not a single bit. The only time my heart feels like it's been ripped out of my chest is when I realize he's still out there living and worst of all,  breathing. You should look into a good therapist, they can help you through this struggle and help you prevent being abused again in the future."
Mediums,ffctpkg,t1_ffc2dye,1579807061.0,And doesn't that person sound a little wacky to you? Why are we listening to wacky? Let wacky be wacky and you be you. Don't feed into their deranged beliefs.
Psychic,ffcrbts,t3_esjr8y,1579805653.0,I don't usually actually laugh at these but this one did it.
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,ffcq18q,t1_ffcml50,1579804806.0,"Yup, karma is where the peace of mind for me comes in too. That's how we have to get through the hell, remember and believe that karma is real."

NarcissisticAbuse,ffc7vhh,t3_eskoe0,1579793560.0,"I'm so glad you caught this!! 



I have caught this with one of my ""friends."" I now watch everything someone around me does because I (like you it sounds) REFUSE to have another fucked up person so close to me in my life. Well, I recently was expressing how much I liked a person to said friend and friend then went on a rant about why I couldn't date this person..... EXCUSE ME!?! Yeah, I don't think so. I don't think you get to tell me what I will do in my life and I ESPECIALLY see the red flag if I'm explaining how much I like this person and how sweet they are to me. If you're going to sit in my face and tell me I can't date them then you're in for a rude awakening. I can see the jealousy from here actually. 



It's not hard to see who wants what's best for you and who doesn't but N's and other people in the cluster B family are very good at pretending who they want to be. If they go way over the top to compliment people on stupid things like, ""I really like your fence (just a normal fence) did you pick it out?"" Yeah, they're fucked in the head. Bonus points if they say it to their friends ex. Yes, this is oddly specific. However, if they're just simply sweet they may say things such as, ""I like your purse."" Or ""I like you because ____."" That's a normal human being. If you watch a cluster b person out in the wild some of them will compliment a frog if it came down to it. I mean, it's really ridiculous how much they go out of their way to appear kind because apart from throwing out a bunch of fake ass compliments they do not actually know what the word nice means or how to be it.



Sorry for my rant!"
Mediums,ffc5ho9,t3_estgqc,1579791991.0,"What do you mean when you say you want to explore it more? 


Do you mean you'd like to know why these spirits are coming to you and how to better communicate with them? If this is what you'd lile to do then when they are withyou remain calm and collected - have a conversation with them. If you remain calm it should just come to you."
diabetes_t1,ffc4zrb,t3_essdfi,1579791659.0,I'm a parent of a T1 and I can say when I meet another T1 parent or T1 I can feel the love for them in my soul. I'm like - YOU GUYS GET IT - OMG! IT'S MY PEOPLE! I love it.
NarcissisticAbuse,ffc3ybt,t1_ffbzbyx,1579790949.0,"If you confront her then do it for you. Do it to get it off your chest but do not do it to see remorse from her in order to make yourself feel better about all of this abuse you went through - because and this is very important to remember - the abuser feels no remorse! Nothing, nada. She might even laugh in your face and say you experienced zero abuse. Be very mindful about the fact that confronting her could lead to even more hurt onto you. Choose very wisely and think about this long and hard before you confront her. It's typically not worth the confrontation. Also, considering you still live together confronting her could actually cause her abuse to escalate during the remainder of the time you live together. She will likely get more glee out of hurting you and will do it more often."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffajqa2,t1_ffa15xi,1579737443.0,I agree. I immediately thought his classmates were more than capable of this. I also *knew* his head had been bashed in before I even read it so I'm going with my instincts on this one. What's shocking though is that nobody has spoken up about what has since happened in the years since this occurred.
NarcissisticAbuse,ff9msw8,t1_ff9kcof,1579716279.0,"Yes, I am too!"
precognition,ff958gg,t3_esa21i,1579705140.0,"No, however this is very interesting. Could you elaborate on what your message to your present self was?"
Psychic,ff94rx8,t1_ff8vjqi,1579704827.0,Depends on the life you lived tho.. some do not have a choice which is a causation from the life the lived. Want to choose when you reincarnate? Be good to others.
JustNoSO,ff85b7p,t1_ff813rn,1579666396.0,You sound really frustrated and I completely understand why. I have no advice but just want to add that I hope things get better for you with your wife.
funny,ff6ghwx,t1_ff5tlla,1579626690.0,"I feel like this was probably their plan all along. They met, started falling for each other and she was like, ""my family sucks"" and he was like, ""I hate living as a prince."" So, they concocted this plan. Good for them! 3 million a year sounds like they'll be just fine."
JUSTNOMIL,ff63htz,t1_ff634aw,1579618208.0,"Yes, exactly. We don't know what MIL is like nor what DIL is like nor what DIL wants."
JUSTNOMIL,ff63ecl,t3_erurry,1579618137.0,"Is your mother kind to DIL? In most cases the MIL is anything but kind which is where the issues arise from. 



I can handle overbearing if she's kind and I think most others on here would welcome with that with welcoming arms as well after what they've been through. 



So, we need a little more info before we can give many suggestions."
offmychest,ff55j2n,t1_ff54qcf,1579580825.0,"THIS right here op. Also, have some compassion for yourself, you deserve it."
DIY,ff3xabd,t1_ff3k0q5,1579550871.0,I'm not op but I've done this before using a brush and it turned out great!
tifu,ff3812o,t1_ff2gprh,1579535878.0,Well said and excellent parenting tip!
Reincarnation,ff35l9g,t3_er31id,1579534218.0,"Thanks for posting this here! I missed your post on the other sub and loved reading about this experience with your son! As others have said I'd write it all down but he also may not forget these memories. I have past life memories that I remember, as does my sister and my daughter. So, there's hope that he won't forget all of this!"
Thetruthishere,ff1tngy,t1_ff1oumu,1579485923.0,"This is not the story for everyone. Sometimes I've heard there'san ""opening"" aka someone is pregnant and the soul just goes. This usually occurs within circles that you have reincarnated with many times."
pastlives,ff1eqb5,t3_equvfd,1579478265.0,"Yes, this is absolutely possible! It could also be that your soulmate passed away earlier in this life as well."
Psychic,feugz1x,t3_eqmyyk,1579386488.0,"This is telepathy and it's very real. 


How did you realize you could do this or what it actually was? It took me a very long time to figure out that I was doing this."
Paranormal,ferou9p,t3_eqe1fl,1579356629.0,My daughter can do this too. There's nothing to be freaked out about. You can read up on which colors the different auras mean - it's pretty interesting and I'd imagine this would be a really neat gift to have so consider yourself lucky!
Parenting,fek4axe,t3_epldaw,1579192310.0,"This might be an unpopular opinion and although this could have been said with more tact, tactfully said can be hard in the heat of the moment. But sometimes the truth hurts. I would apologize but you know what? Maybe this is exactly what your daughter needed to hear."
NarcissisticAbuse,fek2v6m,t3_epl49y,1579191440.0,There's not much else you can do. You've tried to warn her and good on you for doing so! These are her life lessons to learn now. I would step away from the friendship for now. It may even take a few years before she wakes up and sees N sociopath for what he is. The thing about N sociopaths is that they are very skillful in what they do. It might take your friend awhile to see through the act but rest assured she will because the N sociopaths can't keep up the charade forever.
NarcissisticAbuse,fek264m,t3_epe1uo,1579191012.0,"Okay, so what you need to do right now is get strong. Really fucking strong. Because you need to LEAVE. As far as I can tell you two do not have children together and this is only going to get worse. If he's making you cry, drunk or not - he is NOT worth it. Is he physically abusive to you or so far just emotionally? I couldn't drink around my N sociopath because he would harm me extremely bad and if I said the next day, ""I remember you doing x,y,z to me"" he would completely deny it and I was left trying to fix the emotional aftermath of his abuse by myself. Be careful drinking around him because your situation might escalate. 



We are here for you. Let's start an exit plan. Do you guys live together? Can we start by figuring out you could leave once the lease is up? 



As for why he shows his good side to his best female friend is only for crazy making purposes. He wants you to feel like you're the crazy one because look at how much bff loves him. Clearly he's not the one with issues, you see - you are. Don't fall for this."
Psychic,feikf4l,t3_ep7xuh,1579140590.0,It sounds like you have a gift. The same thing happens to me with street lights if I'm really upset or stressed out. Once an entire road of street lights went out one by one as we drove under them. It could have been a glitch but my daughter and I still talk about it.
NarcissisticAbuse,feijpv4,t1_feiho6j,1579140114.0,"Yup, you learn to be like a trained dog around the N. One must always achieve making the N happy otherwise there'll be hell to pay. Although, hell came in many forms, for many reasons, mostly zero reasons and wasn't at all avoidable. I'm glad you got out and I really hope op listens to what advice you have to offer! You deserve better op!


Edit to add: Did you also learn to act stupid around N? Like you have no idea about anything because only N can know the answers for otherwise there will be hell to pay (as you described above)?"
AmItheAsshole,feii6sj,t1_feigfsh,1579139102.0,We should just refer to him as Karen from here on out.
JustNoSO,feihtc3,t3_ep6rfl,1579138856.0,"I'm so happy to hear from you! I think about you and your hell with blaming brian from time to time. 


My ex didn't like me taking baths either. I think it's because they know we're relaxing and God forbid we enjoy ourselves for 20 minutes. I'm taking a bath now in honor of just being able to take a bath if I want to. The level of control they go to is both scary and disgusting. 


Anyway, I'm glad you're doing better. I will be looking forward to hearing about how the past year has been for you - and I really cannot believe it has all almost been a year!"
Showerthoughts,fehvpwf,t1_feh8pbl,1579124815.0,Sending hugs and love. It will get better. It takes a long time to overcome this but it will be done. You'll be okay!
Showerthoughts,fehvkzz,t3_ep4yr4,1579124738.0,"Yes, however in time you can heal and become loving again and create strong bonds with those around you again. I despised this phrase for a very long time after getting out of an extremely abusive relationship. But I'm mostly healed now and although I still think what I went through was bs I'm less bitter over this saying. I also don't see myself as stronger after going through the trenches of hell. So, thank you life."
AskReddit,fefr8r4,t1_fef7j7z,1579062881.0,I have one. It turns out we decided to just try dating before turning 40.

AmItheAsshole,feekvoo,t1_fedz6dx,1579035811.0,"Exactly this. It all depends on her personality. I would think this was the sweetest thing ever, even if it was ungodly ugly. However, not all women would feel that way and some could be extremely offended to the point of possibly ruining the relationship. Op is the only one here who knows how his future fiance will react and should judge accordingly."
UnresolvedMysteries,feehxs0,t1_feefy2a,1579034108.0,"Exactly. I don't care what her mental status was, you do not leave an infant outside to freeze to death. I had tears in my eyes when someone my friend knew did this to a hamster - my friend and I were both very upset over it. But a baby?!? A baby?? And all people have to say is, ""we don't know what her mental status was like""... I think this is enough reddit for me today."
offmychest,fed1h8y,t1_feczpu8,1578993938.0,Glad you are feeling better. Not every point of your life will be filled with sunshine but it's worth it to keep pushing through the storms. I do hope you can find some better friends though.
