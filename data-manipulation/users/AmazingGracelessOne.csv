rupaulsdragrace,ffas39c,t1_ffafne9,1579743186.0,"Or Silky. She was sloppy for the magic show. The body suit was basic , the blazer was clearly just to cover the ill-fitting bodysuit, and her padding was apparently terrible. It annoys me extra because the last week she didn't bother to paint her face and was just screwing around the work room while everyone else was getting ready. Everyone else put so much effort in and she just expected to breeze through."
rupaulsdragrace,ffar230,t1_ffahzee,1579742492.0,"I felt like A'keira did poorly in the challenge and her runway did not fit the challenge and was also underwhelming. Silky was better in the challenge, but she looked sloppy. Her runway look was good though. Plus, the previous week she didn't even paint her face because she thought her roach costume was enough. So when the judges heard that they rejected the script idea which lead the magic show mess, they should have been bottoms."

rupaulsdragrace,ffaf94a,t1_ffacsy7,1579734349.0,"Yeah, it sort of ruins the show for me. I knew there had to be some scripting and prompting behind the scenes, but this is blatant manipulation of the competition and it's hard to swallow even if I like Vangie."
90DayFiance,ff8f42o,t1_ff83kna,1579675777.0,"Who do you think gets off easy because they don't have red hair and Botox? I don't check in here a whole lot, but I've read comments criticizing children in this subreddit so I have a hard time believing that this sub lets anyone off easy. Steven was dragged his whole season. When his name comes up, most people still talk about what an asshole he is, the rest express hope that he's not an asshole anymore for the sake of Olga and their child. Jesse gets a ton of criticism and is almost universally disliked/hated. People go as far to preface how much they hate him and agreeing with him before commenting about Darcey's drinking. Honestly, other than being an unbearable narcissist and somewhat asshole, what has Jesse done to deserve the level of vitriol he gets? 

Is Pao objectively the worst person on the show? No. Paul is an arsonist, the Mormon guy probably groomed a foreign teenager for marriage, Azan scammed a single mother out of thousands of dollars, Nicole uses her child as leverage to make her family do what she wants, Laura did a bunch of awful things including possibly faking a black eye to accuse Aladdin of domestic violence, Leida was absolutely horrible to Tasha and wanted Eric to stop paying child support to support her and her child and maybe killed someone, then there's the new guy who beat his ex severely, abused children, and maybe had something to do with a child's death. The reason she comes up as often as she does is because she's been on multiple seasons, is active on social media, and is now on Pillow Talk. Most people here find her incredibly unlikeable and like to express it, but I doubt anyone think she's the literal, actual worst person on the show.

Also, I understand that we disagree, but don't down vote me because of it. I come her for discussion and I hate that people just downvote stuff they don't like. It makes me not want to post here."

90DayFiance,ff7p8dv,t1_ff6nbyq,1579655001.0,"I'm sorry, but which part of my comment is going to age like milk? The part where I said Jasmin a human being? Or the part where I said she isn't obligated to submit to unwanted sexual advances for any reason? Or when I said people setting boundaries doesn't make them jerks, but crossing/mocking them might? I don't know what you think is going to happen this season, but I have a hard time believing any of it is going to change my mind about any of those completely reasonable points. 

But since you brought it up, people change their habits and lifestyle for a partner all the time. Marriage, living together, having children, moving, religious conversions, changing careers, vasectomies/tubal litigation are all bigger changes that people make everyday. Compare those to spend less time in partying with friends and drinking. Asking a partner to change or giving an ultimatum isn't universally bad either. Please quit smoking is an example of a fair, positive change. Stop doing heroine or I'm leaving is an example of a good ultimatum. Open communication of your wants and needs is extremely important to having a happy, healthy relationship. I didn't comment on the compatibility or longevity of their relationship, but my husband and I are opposites, quite similar to Jasmin and Blake actually, and we've been together for over ten years. We work because even though we're opposites, we respect each other's boundaries and communicate. I don't know if they're going to last. I've only seen a few hours of edited footage from 3 months of their lives that has surely had some staging involved. I can't make a guess on it, especially because their relationship doesn't take place in a vacuum."
90DayFiance,ff6j6gm,t1_ff4vusg,1579628336.0,"Strongly disagree. She's a human being and set a firm boundary with her partner. She's not obligated to have to have his tongue down her throat so she can taste the Jager because he feels randy after a night of partying.  Some people won't kiss their partner after smoking, drinking, or eating pungent foods because it grosses them out. It doesn't make them jerks. However, disregarding someone's boundary and name calling because you don't agree/like it is jerk behavior."
90DayFiance,ff6he3j,t1_ff5iq8m,1579627245.0,"I understand why people think this, but I tend to think she could do better than a guy who lives with his parents and has an unstable career and with a guy more suitable to her quiet dinner/no alcohol preferences. I think she genuinely likes him."
90DayFiance,ff64c7k,t1_ff4hzyr,1579618805.0,"I think she cares about his friends and family, but she's clearly a grower not a shower. His friends are into partying and clearly want her to prove herself, both of which make her uncomfortable. The one woman seems to have some one sided feelings toward him and it feels like everything she says as an undercurrent of ""I could make him happier than you if he'd only just let me and I hope there's still a chance for that."" She lives with his parents, which is awkward, and is forced to interact with them on a very personal level daily, sometimes without him there for a buffer. I think she's keeping them at a polite distance while she's processing everything, but it reads as disinterest because she has a cool personality and resting bitch face."
90DayFiance,ff638c8,t1_ff4to6h,1579618017.0,"I would consider Pao to be emotionally abusive. She really seems to relish degrading him, like when her BFF said he wanted her to get back with her ex and that her marriage would fail, she was smiling the whole time. She encourages her friend to disrespect Russ, while demanding Russ get over it and apologize for making her friend disrespect him and also holding a grudge against his mother for vague reasons."

KDRAMA,feh470r,t1_feg6lct,1579108788.0,"I totally agree. I've had to explain why I watch dramas dozens of times and it always boils down to that I like slow romances that build to to physical intimacy, but without uncomfortably long slobbery tongue tangling. I'm not a big fan of insta-love, but it's usually hard to win the object of affection in dramas so I'll watch it anyway. I also enjoy that it's in an long series format with a definitive end. 

I appreciate that it's becoming more mainstream in the US with Netflix producing them because that means more dramas and bigger budgets. I hate that they split the seasons, but I just won't watch until there's a complete show. I hope it means there will be more daring and unconventional dramas in the future."
KDRAMA,feg0fcs,t1_fefu824,1579071648.0,"I love dramas because of the slow build up to physical intimacy. I don't mind the chaste kisses thing, but I like a little more.

He should just learn to be happy with having Mursel around to have loud sex with his mom in between rounds of shitting on their culture because right now he just sounds super ungrateful. Idk why he thinks he should be treated with kid gloves when he's the only adult in the whole god-damned house, but he needs to cut that shit out because Anna deserves to be happy even if it means her kids have to hide behind a false panel in the kitchen when Mursel's family comes to visit."

She was back home for the first time in who knows how long and was probably enjoying the food she misses while she was living in Russia. They hadn't even been in the US for a week and she seems to be at a healthy weight so it's kind of really controlling to criticize her eating in front of her sister and during filming.
