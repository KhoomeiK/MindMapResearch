He used dirty little tricks to never answer a question and pretend that he knows what hes talking about. Definitely on speed as well to make sure he can keep up his appearance. Plays to the audience. Honestly,  these debates don't prove anything other than they can make someone else look bad."
dankchristianmemes,ffwygku,t1_ffwvik2,1580313840.0,"To add to this; southern black churches are different to say Caribbean black churches in how prayer, songs and the total vibe of it. As a white Jew, it was quite a different experience to those giant mega churches. Completely different atmosphere."

beholdthemasterrace,ffm6grh,t1_ffk1bhq,1580049260.0,"From the little I know of Christianity as a whole, they generally look at the old testament as what it is. The new testament is the new teachings. It even says so in the new testament that this shit is retconned, but people love to bring old testament up as against Christian's like they be about that life."
environment,fffjz5l,t1_fffcgde,1579885597.0,"Oh for sure he's not. Didn't mean to say he was. As he points out himself that he doesn't believe in global warming and that hes ""not a scientist"". 
He defends the Everglades by buying up the land and not allowing oil companies to drill. Hes not racing to the bottom like so many other politicians love to do when it comes to our environment."

quityourbullshit,ff92fe9,t1_ff8pu3s,1579703181.0,"Studying it right now. After finishing Conservation of natural resources, starting environmental law and policies this semester, definitely not easy, as you need pre reqs in college Algebra and chem 1. What you learn in these classes is more about how industries pollute, where and when we put in the laws to combat this. Found out the other day that it was Republican Nixon who put in the most environmental laws during his presidency.  Thought that was interesting."

TwoBestFriendsPlay,ff6wn1k,t1_ff43kg5,1579636407.0,"Seems to be a issue with what is important to the story and gameplay for people like Pat and I. Censoring titties is very low on the totem pole of what we care about. 
As far as drawing lines for censorship, can't hate a company thats all about that bottom line. If their game won't sell to american audience as a whole because the tiddies would pump up the games rating, limiting their audience, hide dem boobies. 

Pat's a troll and loves to antagonize. He's someone who will say to a large group of people, live in person, ""your taste in music is bad and you should feel bad"". Its kinda of his shtick."
environment,ff35w58,t1_ff21rjc,1579534427.0,"He only cares about things that directly impact him and his empire.  He gave the state of Florida millions of dollars to help fight off the ever growing red tide here on my coast. Great for me since I'm in the environmental field, but he didn't do it for the environment, he did it because Florida makes a killing from its beaches and red tide hurts the states bottom line."

If this story is still canon, the IG11 unit is one of those copies. IG88 died in the Deathstar after uploading its conciousness. The novel suggested that was one of the many reasons a small band of rebels was able to take out something as impressive as the deathstar."
