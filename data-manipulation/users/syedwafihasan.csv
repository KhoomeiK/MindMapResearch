I mean, I completely understand that one would want to preserve life and not be complicit in the death of someone but isn't withholding this information akin to forcing someone to live and exist against their will? Is this not torture in itself? 

It's a simple query : what's the best way to die? If you cannot answer it in the sub because of the rules, please just message it to me (and anyone who asks). Free them from this hellhole"

I do not have advice or words of consolation, since I too am in a difficult position. All I can say is, keep on trying, friend. Explore interests, perhaps. Dunno how useful this is, if it even is useful"
SuicideWatch,fdylb34,t3_encds6,1578781026.0,"I personally believe I'm better off without love/relationships. Last relationship I had left me scarred, majorly depressed, suicidal, and socially anxious to the extent that any thought of having a partner now terrifies me. The person involved said, ""I never actually loved you"" and that hit deep and hard. 

That, combined with the fact that I'm ugly as fuck, makes me think I'm really better off alone. Also, frankly, no one deserves a fat suicidal ugly piece of shit like me as their boyfriend.
