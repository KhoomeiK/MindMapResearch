One of my earlier customers used a Yahoo email address and emailed ""PLEASE I WANT INFO NOW"" (my B2B system sold for over $100K). I just rolled my eyes but for some reason sent him the standard info package. Turns out English was his second language, he was an independent sales agent in a developing country, and had a client looking for my kind of system. That was a $200,000 sale. Another was from someone who just said he was a college student looking for info. I humored him too, sent the info, didn't bother to follow up and didn't hear from him for a year when he came back with a request for proposal that I won ($150,000 sale). Turns out he was a graduate student and worked in his University's aviation department that needed my system.

Entrepreneur,fe5xbpm,t1_fe5ngfo,1578877030.0,"I knew the industry because I had always been interested in aviation, and got my first job out of college in that industry. I learned the lingo and became familiar with some of the different niches within aviation, so I looked there first for ideas. 

I don't think it's absolutely necessary to do it in a niche you already know, but it really helps with product development and sales. So many little decisions are made by programmers themselves -- functional specs written by a SME or somebody else can't cover every little thing -- so many of those little decisions can be implemented in an annoying way if the programmer isn't familiar with how the end user will use it. Being in the niche already helps with those little things, and I think can really make a product stand out.  That's why if you can't find an opportunity in a niche you have experience in, I would suggest to find another niche you have a personal or academic interest in at least, and try to get a job in that sector just to learn the problems and complaints of existing technology they use."
Entrepreneur,fe51ugx,t3_enpj7j,1578864933.0,"I was the same, and found my product idea in a small b2b niche in aviation. It's my anecdotal opinion that too many people (especially VC-backed) focus on the billion-dollar ideas in broad consumer or retail markets, leaving a ton of small niche b2b markets stagnant, and especially in sore need of innovation and better product offerings. Billion-dollar ideas are nice, but nothing wrong with tens-of-millions ideas either, IMO. I didn't make billions myself, but I made enough millions anyway to retire early. 

I started with seeing just how terrible the existing software in the niche both looked and performed. Old graphics, poor calculating times, awkward interfaces, unnecessary functionality, etc. I think the ""boring"" niches attract ""boring"" programmers who either couldn't get into the sexier tech companies, or who don't care where they work as long as they get paid and go home at 5. It shows in their product.

So I targeted that same product idea, hoping to make a much better version than the basically only two domestic competitors in that niche. One company was openly traded on an OTC market so they had their financial statements, revenue and their guess of their market size easily obtainable in their annual reports. The other competitor was privately held, but counting rough number of employees (marketing material on their website, and google street view and counting cars in their parking lot) times $200-300K per employee as a guideline, showed me if I got just 10% of their business, I should be making serious money.  

If you come up with a completely new product idea, yes, market validation is a problem. With an existing idea, you know the market exists and has been validated because of the success of your competitors. And especially in these ""small"" niches with few competitors, there will always be a small number disgruntled with the lack of offerings or reputation of those competitors and are willing to try something new, especially when having systems different than their own competitors might give them a competitive advantage. 

That's what I found, anyway. I used that as a selling point, plus that ""you're just a customer number to them, but would be my entire focus, so I'd work with you after delivery to make sure it's exactly what you want and need."" I had a prototype that I felt looked and functioned really well, so they were willing to put 25% down and first delivery in about 11 months. That let me quit my existing job and work on it full-time. Because they were the first and only customer of this better system, they felt it was worth the wait and additional time to finish it because they'd be first in their market with it. They loved that I took care of everything -- hardware, furniture, consoles, wiring it up, installing it and training their people on site. Then that I hung around for a week while they got used to it. Then listening to their wish list of new things they wanted and implementing them without cost (I figured if they wanted it, future buyers would probably want it too). I'd send regular updates, and they really like that I'd visit in person about once a month to see how things were going, ""tune"" it up, train new people, etc, whatever they wanted. I was a free consultant, really.

With the success of that and another 6 months of continued development based on their feedback, I was ready for new customers. I got a booth at their industry trade show, and my first customer (also at the show) praised it and my focused customer service. Word gets around fast in small industries like that, and new sales started coming in. I hired my first employees (sales, IT then an engineer), and went from there, eventually selling the company to a much larger one who wanted to get into the niche already running and with a good reputation. 

Just my story, FWIW."

Entrepreneur,fdluez1,t3_em1eq3,1578532736.0,"I certainly worked that. You can easily get to the stage where you can't hire another person until you increase sales, but you can't handle more sales unless you hire another person. So, you end up working two or more jobs in a day to get out of that catch 22. 

Before my first employee, for example (turnkey B2B hardware/software company), I'd spend 2-3 hours answering emails and customer service requests, 5-6 hours programming for the next release, maybe 2-3 hours unpacking boxes and setting up hardware for the next delivery, then 3-4 hours writing the next sales proposal and putting together slides for the sales presentation.

Then with the increased sales, I could now afford to hire my first two employees, a salesperson and IT/customer support person to let me focus on programming, except I found they needed training to learn the job, the product, the processes to follow, etc, so I had to train and shadow them awhile until they got up to speed, and put off programming until later in the day. So still I was in 12-16 hour days.

Eventually they were productive, but now I needed to hire a programmer to take over my programming tasks so I could focus more on helping (increase) sales, handling the additional proposals and presentations we were doing. But the programmer needed to be trained and get familiar with the codebase before being productive, which also required me to finish documenting my code and put together an overall reference guide on the design for him and the others to follow. So again, 12-16 hour days.

Etc... It took about five years until I could comfortably put in a regular workday. When you're growing, you just find yourself constantly behind and overworked, in my experience."

I started with two parallel strategies, a bucket managed by professional ""wealth managers"" (Fidelity Wealth Management), and plain index funds I managed myself (actually, just periodically checked). After four years of that, the wealth managers were still consistently underperforming the market, *plus* they were taking 1% on top of that, *plus* they had almost everything in high-fee mutual funds that were taking another 1-1.5% fee. That was like $80K a year I was paying to financial managers, to make even less than my own index funds were making. 

I could only conclude these retail wealth managers just aren't worth it except for those completely clueless about anything financial, e.g. elderly widows whose spouses used to manage all their money, and don't care about optimizing returns as long as all their bills get paid. 

Where wealth management can make sense I think is at the hedge fund level, but I found the consistent high performers want $20 million kinds of minimum investments. 

So I switched everything to the 3 bucket portfolio and it's worked as advertised. I don't see at as ""too good to be true,"" just that I'm getting ""average market rate"" which is fine. I check things maybe monthly, watch bond fund payouts get deposited into my bank account and dividends deposited quarterly.

Then when we'd play ""for real,"" I'd only let them take back obvious one or two move blunders. If they missed a more complicated tactic, we'd usually end the game there (no fun getting crushed a piece down) and we'd go over the tactic, I'd tell them ""so remember that!"" and we'd start over. 

Then whenever they'd last to the endgame and get into a losing position, I'd stop the game, show them why it's losing, back up to what they could have done and show the endgame idea they should have tried. 

We never played many full games to completion because of that. When we did (""don't give me any hints""), I'd crush them and they'd just laugh.

I had a ton of other projects I always wanted to pursue, and assumed I'd want to jump back into the software business at some point. My company wasn't games, but I had worked previously in the game industry and was a programmer by original profession, so like you I figured I might do something game related, either myself or start a studio.     

What I found though, was I lost all tolerance for risk. The saying ""when you have nothing, you have nothing to lose"" was absolutely true in my experience, and looking back is what fueled my passion to succeed, to work long hours, and to take risks. Once I had everything I needed, though, I now had everything to lose. And what to gain? A little more money I didn't need? The idea of starting a studio and writing payroll checks all over again, out of my personal money, struggling to meet milestones and all the stress involved with managing people, or even just doing a small indie app myself and sitting in my office stepping through the debugger and trying to get stupid pixels to line up, late into the night every night while my kids grew up without me, simply lost all its appeal. 

I'm older than you (51 now) so it may be different for you, but I've found happiness and purpose just in doing hobbies, being there with my kids, and enjoying the days with no pressure and no deadlines. Every day is a Saturday for me. I guess I'd suggest not to pressure yourself to have to accomplish something in your retirement.

What it doesn't include though is a visual system, or computer hardware and software to run things on top of that. They offer all that for an additional $18K or so, but I think you can piece those elements together yourself for much cheaper."
Entrepreneur,fdbzd0r,t1_fdavam6,1578264225.0,"It could be something like a new game studio, where that is typical. I almost got into one when I worked for another studio. Publishers like to hire entire production teams that have successfully worked together, and the team will often quit en masse and start their own studio once the deal is signed. Publishers offer a small down payment and the rest in milestone payments, so upfront investment is needed to pay salaries (very few people are willing to work for equity or future payouts, in my experience). Our publisher said they weren't going to finance a startup, just provide standard industry payments so we faced a large cash flow problem and couldn't raise the needed funding."

fatFIRE,fd06o3m,t1_fcwzqg2,1578114431.0,My financial objectives would be different if they thought I had a much smaller amount -- they would push me toward more accumulation for retirement instead of preservation. They'd also question why I retired on such a small amount.
chess,fcw94pk,t1_fctw5qv,1578019993.0,I've watched lots of top tournaments in person and online and have never seen it. It's also debatable [as discussed here with top arbiters](http://www.uschess.org/content/view/8720/473). Your move isn't completed until you press the clock (USCF 6b).

fatFIRE,fcvxciz,t1_fcvv9y9,1578012239.0,"Are you sure they use the word “wages” and not “income?” My state has the same amounts but it’s calculated from form 1040 adjusted gross income plus tax exempt interest. So without any wages, it’s all ordinary dividends plus all bond/other interest plus all capital gains. It doesn’t include qualified dividends though."
fatFIRE,fct1dik,t1_fcr7dou,1577930350.0,"Fidelity Wealth Management was like that, at least a decade ago when I put a large chunk of my assets with them. They stuck me into 40 high-fee, high-commission (to them) mutual funds that of course underperformed the market, on top of the 1.5% mutual fund fees and 1% wealth manager fee. Then there was constant pressure (monthly phone calls) to put *all* of my cash with them. I think fiduciary rules have changed since then and they may be different, but I did not have a good experience with them. My second bucket of index and bond funds outperformed them consistently and I went to 100%  self-managed after a few years."
