Here’s the thing: Being economically right-wing is one thing; I understand it to an extent because most people are born in countries that brainwash them into hating anything other than capitalism from birth; but the main reason anyone is socially right wing is because their demographics suggest that they are privileged but nevertheless they’ve gone through the harsh reality of what capitalism can bring and seen immigrants and minorities treated like the sole victims of the system, and so out of a rational angry response to that blamed on the immigrants and minorities rather than the original source of the problem which is capitalism. 

Human beings don’t like killing human beings. It feels wrong and it feels terrible and exhausting to do. But when you can convince yourself that the people you’re killing *aren’t actually people*, at least subconsciously, you can bring yourself to accept and even enjoy murdering them. This is how regimes like the Nazis in Germany were able to convince the masses to accept the systematic murder of Jews and it’s how the modern far right tricks innocent people into becoming villains that lack empathy for others. 

How do I know all this? Because I’m a relatively young white boy, and I’m straight, and I saw all the bullshit anti-SJW shit on YouTube, and I went down the rabbit hole. Luckily once I got to the phase where I was citing crime statistics I realized what was happening and I caught myself.

PoliticalCompassMemes,ff430xn,t1_ff40y02,1579554443.0,"I think I can answer 1 and 2 with the same explanation: building a McDonald’s is not adding value to the land, because you’re not making the McDonald’s out of the land. You’re making it out of the raw resources it’s built out of and you’re putting them on the land. Raw material is material that has not yet been manipulated by human contact, at least not to a meaningful extent. What we call ‘land’ is not material though. It’s the concept of area. 

For 3, theft is theft. If, hypothetically, you own a farm, and you’re using your own crops to feed yourself and your family, and someone comes in and starts taking your crops, they’re stealing from you, because they’re taking the raw materials(seeds) that you’ve grown into crops through whatever means you used. However, if they plant their own crops in your farm without damaging your crops, they’re not taking any value away from you and therefore they are not stealing. You wouldn’t even have to worry about that though because it would be incredibly inconvenient to do something like that and it would be petty as fuck.

PoliticalCompassMemes,ff3svag,t1_ff3rrnd,1579548121.0,"Land ownership would not be allowed in anarcho-communist society. They would not respect your claim to the land. They would however respect your claim to whatever property you have on the land(buildings, materials, et.c.) and let you keep using it. If you defended the land with weaponry that’s when they would start attacking you back. That’s one of the reasons a society must be culturally prepared for anarchism; people have to understand and get used to the idea that you can’t “own” land, an idea that is pretty ingrained in capitalist society.

In my opinion the main reason why you shouldn’t be able to own land is because you didn’t produce it and it was there before not only you but before *anyone* was born, so claiming it for your own is not justified. However if you produce something out of raw material, you’ve added value to it, and therefore you should be able to own it."
