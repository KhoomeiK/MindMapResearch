I usually make it a point to wear them if I'm rolling a ceiling! I have been a smoker for 30 years, so because I'm too pussy to quit that, I wear a mask when spraying any paint. Otherwise it gets to me after a while. I try not to spray on windy days! So there isn't much relief from being outdoors. My advice would be do it whenever you work, but I don't think it's going to kill you if you skip once or twice. Just my 2 cents"

Can't really go wrong with Purdy brushes, but I'm not a fan of their exterior 2.5"" trim brushes. Valspar has a ""for all stain"" 2"" trim brush that works fantastic on trim and crown molding with paint that tends to leave brush strokes.
