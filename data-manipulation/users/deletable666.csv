todayilearned,ffkkvja,t1_ffkjtlb,1580024449.0,"Again, just a massive budget. He may be a great producer but he signed his portion of the pandora pie away in order to get more exposure. He made a ton of money off this song. He wasn’t the only person involved in it. 

All I see here is outrage from people who don’t understand how the music business works. The outrage shouldn’t be because Pharrell didn’t make enough from pandora, but that independent artists and musicians that aren’t deep in the music business cult don’t make shit from streaming services"
todayilearned,ffkkhg5,t1_ffjwjp9,1580024260.0,"Well the eXpOsUrE netted him vas-y sums of money through ticket sales, tv spots, advertisements, movie licensing, tv licensing, digital purchases, physical purchases, etc. 

Who do you think paid to get this song so popular? The labels. Pharrell and his team of lawyers signed a contract signing away the vast majority of profits from pandora in order to get the labels to push the song. Why pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to advertise a song when the labels will do it for a revenue percentage and no upfront cost?

Everyone gets a piece of the pie in pop music. It doesn’t come up organically."
todayilearned,ffkjsez,t1_ffjsiz5,1580023932.0,"Well then don’t sign your rights away. Come back and tell me how much money he made from the ticket sales, all other streaming and purchasing combine, the commercials and movies and tv shoes it was featured in, etc. Songs only get tat popular because labels are behind them paying ridiculous amounts of money to push it to every network, radio station, blog, movie, streaming service, music store, whatever. 

If you think that these popstars became stars on their own merits then you have an idealized view. 

Money controls all of it. Not to take away from the talent or artistry of the people getting hoisted up in he spotlight, but it’s not just their own talents that make the famous. 

There are 7 billion people in the world but only 100 famous top 40 musicians? Yeah right. It’s money dude. Rich labels pay to prop up people so they can get more rich."
todayilearned,ffkj5yt,t1_ffk1dg2,1580023633.0,What is he doing production-wise that others aren’t doing? What makes him better than any of the other million producers in the world sans a massive budget
todayilearned,ffkj048,t1_ffk35g6,1580023558.0,"They are paying next to nothing to Pharrell because he signed his rights away to the label in order to make it one of the biggest songs of the year... you are missing insight into how the music business works. 

Get into bed with giant labels that can make you famous, and you will be famous but you won’t make anything from what you have them to make you a star. 

It should serve as an example of how big popstars don’t get their organically and how much influence such a small industry has over you."
todayilearned,ffkimk0,t1_ffjwoca,1580023376.0,"Maybe he shouldn’t work with the people who explicitly say they will take the vast majority of revenue from streaming and sales then. 

He knew this would happen. It was notarized and signed off by both Pharrell’s team of lawyers and the labels team of lawyers. 

He just signed away his portion of the rights to the song in order to get it pushed to anywhere that will take it. Pharrell was irrelevant in the popsphere when that dog was released. All of a sudden he wasn’t and he could sell tickets and merchandise again. 

That’s what happens when you get a massive label to back you. They spend money that you don’t have in order to get your song sent everywhere and tell people it’s good."

todayilearned,ffkhxr6,t1_ffk2ew3,1580023049.0,It was played everywhere because the labels spent tons of money getting everyone to play it... that’s why Pharrell only got 2700 in streaming from pandora... because he and the other people who actually wrote and preformed the song signed away a lot of ownership to get their names back into the pop sphere. Who profits from what. It’s a business.
todayilearned,ffkhn51,t1_ffjy6o8,1580022909.0,"Well maybe don’t get in bed with shady labels that’s only use is using the money they’ve made fucking people over to push the shit everywhere. Most songs don’t spring up on the radio or charts organically. The music industry is a small business, especially at that level. I don’t really feel any sympathy for the dude."
todayilearned,ffkhhbv,t1_ffjxoz2,1580022833.0,"It’s also just from one streaming service... one of the least used ones at that. 

He doesn’t have full songwriting credits either, also it was backed by a giant label that pushed the shit to anyone that would take it so they spent tons of money. 

I don’t know why this is news"

Another example, The World Record Egg. It was a huge viral marketing ploy from a company and nothing was said about it. Meant to look like an organic thing to show clients how many views and interactions they can get. The team is related to the Fyre Fest fiasco as well. 

I use reddit a ton, and I understand they are doing this to make money and not be a public utility, but I don’t want it to go the way of Instagram. At the least every 5th post on IG is an ad, at the most every 3rd. That is only counting official ads, not sponsored content by users- marked as ads or not.

We are constantly bombarded by advertisements and I really believe it has a negative effect on everyone regardless of social class. 

I don’t think it’s some massive conspiracy to subvert the youth, but I think we’re there’s money to be made and no clear laws against it, people will exploit the platform and milk it for all its worth."

Cringetopia,ffhk7hx,t1_ffhjbc3,1579939060.0,Hidden ads as in regular posts that are astroturfed. There is no conspiracy behind it. It’s not illegal to do so and it’s free advertising.

I believe it’s already illegal to leave a car running because of how easy it is to steal a running car. It’s an easily avoidable thing and if your car does get stolen while you leave it unattended and running it puts unnecessary strain on police resources. There is really no valid reason for it either. It seldom gets cold enough that you need to get your car running to heat up and be away from it at the same time. 

It is wasteful. I wish the onus wasn’t on the common person to be a pollution miser but until a large scale change happens it’s the best bet"

nashville,ff8e8h5,t1_ff7x2w5,1579674776.0,"Lol quite the odds, that’s great. People coming to Nashville also have a habit of being very drunk so don’t feel too bad about your area. Also people from Nashville have a habit of being drunk too. 

To help you out, Nashville can be expensive, but not as expensive as some would lead you to believe. I grew up here when it was cheap, and moved back when it was very expensive, but given enough elbow grease and desire you can find a good deal if you scour the web. Take a few visits here, check out every neighborhood time allows, and make your decision from there. Luckily, Nashville is big enough that that many neighborhoods have different feels/vibes/things to do close by. 

If you have questions feel free to ask and I’ll answer the ones I know. 

I’ve never heard of Plant City, so I feront from that living here will be very different (which is probably what you are looking for if you are thinking of moving here). You just have to be really careful because there is a huge boom going on and most real estate agents/owners/ landlords are going to try to fuck you, because if they don’t get you to pay them money they can get someone else. 

You may know, but the best way to decide to move somewhere is to spend a bit of time and get a feel for the city. So please do that. Lots of people come here on a whim and it doesn’t wind up being what they thought. 

Again, I like to think I am knowledgeable about the city so ask away if you want. If you post a thread on this sub, be specific and other knowledgeable people will help you out, but there are tons of shitposts here that get asked everyday so try to be as specific as you can or you might get flamed on or deleted. 

All the best to ya"
