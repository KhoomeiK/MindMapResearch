So your advanced treatments existed in areas where patients were least likely to acquire while the older treatments existed in places you were most likely to acquire. Well into the late 80s and late 90s.

Native American and county health providers still used the ""21 shot"" regimen in 1997, for instance."

After showing up for work for years with black eyes and busted lips, he hit her back once. Just once. But HE was the abuser. The cops went insane on him.

He spent 2 years on probation. Finally  got a divorce. Lost everything. 

It took 8 years to clear his record. And only he showed her pattern of abuse with subsequent husbands was he acknowledged.

But we have this weird social belief women can't be cruel, abusive or rape. Women can be very mean and completely without accountability."

It's been awhile so I can't remember all their names but they have at least two bonafide academics routinely on the podcast.

One is an actual folklorist/historian, another is an actual theologian/historian and a Community of Christ leader. One of them is a pretty awesome attorney, another is a scholar specialist in Russian Literature but is sharp-as-a-tack in other disciplines as well. And really, all the others have a wide range of esoteric and eclectic knowledge and skills. One of those fuckers (that's a tease going out to them) has some kind of lead for you.
