Asmongold,ffcvgjq,t1_ffctmu1,1579808095.0,"No one should ever donate if it puts them in financial trouble, and people who feel obligated to donate to a streamer or give them money in any shape or form have the wrong kind of mindset.

>So many times I see people saying, ""This is my last 5 dollars, blah blah blah."" And then there are people that apologize for not donating, as if they feel like they have to donate.

Donations like these are unfortunately common and, from what I can tell, only make the streamers feel uncomfortable. But as you said, it's not a problem with the streamers. Rather it's a matter of misconceived feelings of guilt and irresponsible spending habits.

I see it happen more often with ""smaller"" (1K-3K viewers) streamers though."
Asmongold,ffcska8,t1_ffcqlso,1579806391.0,"Depends on your perspective. Kids are impressionable, that's true, but most adults view streamers as just another branch of entertainment that's not all that different from watching Netflix or playing video games.

Speaking from personal experience, streams have offered a great escape for me when things in real life weren't looking too great. It's important to get real, professional help as well though, but there's nothing wrong with finding your own ways to cope (as long as they're not self-destructive).

And if you feel like donating to show your appreciation, then go for it."
Asmongold,ffcpl8d,t1_ffcon1p,1579804513.0,"Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.

Personally I think entertainers are an important part of society (especially in modern times with depression being on the rise) and they should be rewarded for what they do. Until you've streamed or made videos, you don't really realize how much of your personal time you're sacrificing to please strangers on the internet."

Asmongold,ffcgwki,t3_esvsf5,1579799205.0,"Solid video from our boy Zack. Pretty much in line with my own thinking as well. I see people constantly get called idiots for donating to big streamers (aka ""millionaires"") but why though? If it makes them happy, let them. It's their (or their mom's) money.

He answered **that** question at the end of the video, to those interested:

> I've got like maybe one or two more of these videos that I'm gonna cook up in my attic. And then after that, I'll probably make a ""return to streaming"" video and, you know, we'll go through the whole thing.

Looking at his past five uploads, he seemed to put up a video fairly consistently every 4 to 8 days, with the latest video being the exception at 26 days since the last upload.

Going off the more optimistic route of ~6 days between uploads, he could return to streaming at some point between **February 4th to February 10th**.

This is, of course, complete unscientific garbage and assumes you could actually turn Zack's unpredictable upload schedule into some kind of a reliable statistic. So make of it what you will."

NoStupidQuestions,ff8nz8r,t1_ff8nkh3,1579688164.0,Most of my gripes with the show are specifically with the second half. I didn't wanna specify that in my comment since it kind of spoils the fact that the show goes out with a whimper.
NoStupidQuestions,ff8mb3f,t1_ff7y8je,1579685591.0,"AoT is a masterpiece. I view it as the Game of Thrones of anime (which, incidentally, served as a source of inspiration for Isayama himself).

I just hope Isayama can come up with a satisfying ending that ties everything together. Whenever there's a show with this much depth, it always makes me a bit afraid that I might be setting myself up for disappointment by getting too invested.

For your next anime, I would recommend Demon Slayer. Or if you'd prefer a longer ride and don't mind dancing around the fillers, Naruto is one hell of a memorable show (despite all the memes about it)."
NoStupidQuestions,ff8m3mh,t1_ff800wj,1579685270.0,"/u/noneofmybusinessbutt If you do end up watching Death Note, lower your expectations a little. I watched it for the first time last year and the overhyping is what killed it for me.

People made it seem like I was in for some life-changing experience that was going to change my perception of everything. Turns out it was just a pretty average anime with an interesting premise. Plenty of better ones have come out since then, and it doesn't even come close to AoT in terms of its depth."

wow,fda8x5k,t1_fd4vblb,1578243160.0,"I always appreciate a good analogy, but yours falls short of that. Let's analyze why that is.

1. There are more than 12 careers to choose from in real life. Running into someone who has the same career as you is highly unlikely.

2. There are way fewer than 22 races in real life. Running into someone who's the same race as you is something that happens on a daily basis.

3. There are far more ""appearances"" in real life. Running into someone even wearing the same shirt as you has extremely low odds.

4. In real life, people are far more varied in their appearances. Running into someone who resembles you physically is extremely rare.

Therefore, if this same scenario happened in real life, you would have every right to be surprised and post about it on the internet. The odds of something like that happening are easily below 0%.

PrequelMemes,fda781u,t1_fda19ag,1578242565.0,"This is pretty much how I feel about art nowadays, and why I've more or less given up on it. I probably have this Imposter Syndrome or whatever.

Way back when I started drawing, I was just doing it for fun. I quickly learned the most important fundamentals and improved enough to be considered above average.

But I spent every day bombarded with art from true professionals who, from my perspective, know everything. And when I tried to start studying all the different aspects of art, I realized there was a near impossible amount of information to retain. Learning anatomy alone is enough to drive any normal person insane, but there is so much more. Perspective, composition, gesture, foreshortening, structure, etc.

It's too much for me to learn all of this, which is why I've decided to resign to mediocrity. I don't have the will or strength left to study all of these, and still not be able to draw as well as professionals. It's just never going to happen."
