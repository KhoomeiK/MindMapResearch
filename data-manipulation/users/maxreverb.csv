What I *do* see and experience every day is drivers trying to merge into a lane without speeding up to match the speed of the traffic in that lane.

So what you're experiencing (most likely) is 1. you signal to get into the new lane (good) 2. instead of speeding up to match your new lane's flow, you stop accelerating and slow down 3. you think everyone is ""speeding"" to pass you when in fact they're just driving along (as they should)."
