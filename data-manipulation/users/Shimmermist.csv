Monster Sanctuary has added PVP type things recently, I'd have to check to see if they have added other types of multiplayer features.

I think you can do online battles in the digimon games.

I'd have to go check on the rest. I tend not to look into multiplayer as much in early access games, give them time to get it right.

Also, older games I forgot to mention earlier: Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker, Ni No Kuni, and Tales of Symphonia 2 all had monster collection as well. Joker had online battles, no idea if those servers still work.

PlayTemtem,ff4zl3w,t1_ff4tlvy,1579576279.0,"Alright, here's a book if you feel like reading a description of a bunch of games!

&#x200B;

Agreed with the Digimon Cybersleuth games (there are two of them). There is a Digimon world game out too, but that has a lot more micromanagement than the digimon story games. If you prefer a JRPG, get the story games. If you want to haul around a porta potty for your critters, and manage when they poo, train, rest, eat, etc... go ahead and get the world game. I don't enjoy the micromanagement in the world games. That does have an exception of the old digimon world dawn/dusk as those were in the style of the newer story games and I really enjoyed those. Battles in the story games and those two older games are turn based.

Re:Legend is in early access. That's a combo farming sim and creature collection game, but is not complete. They're still putting out updates and trying to get it from early access to final product. It has a lot of potential and I enjoy what is there. You should eventually be able to tame and ride on any monster in the game, including bosses. Some of them can help with farm work if you choose to grow crops. They have shadow versions of their critters too that you can hunt rather than shinies. Battles are active/action. Animations are still rather awkward in delaying the next attack.

Rune Factory 4 is another combo farming/monster collecting game that is being ported to the switch (supposed to be out Feb 25th if it isn't delayed), Rune Factory 5 is in development but not much is known about it yet. The rune factory games don't have the huge selection of monsters that pokemon does and doesn't focus on battles nearly as much, but it's still fun to have a critter at your side helping out in dungeons, or if it is something like a cow monster, producing milk at your farm or helping out in dungeons. Battles are active rather than turn based.

Monster Sanctuary is both monster collection and metroidvania and that one is out and receiving updates. It feels more finished than Re: Legend but is also not complete. I like the familiar that you are given in the beginning as it is a familial monster that is passed from generation to generation and talks to you. This game is harder than pokemon so far. I have to really strategize to beat some bosses. Grinding levels can take a while, at least to the part I've gotten to. No idea if it speeds up later or not. I'm wondering if it is designed so it is hard to be over leveled for a particular part of the story. A chosen creature will follow you around and has map useful abilities such as lighting things on fire, breaking walls, etc... Monsters are acquired by hatching eggs dropped from fighting wild monsters. Battles are turn based.

Monster Crown has older styled graphics and is chugging away on development. It hasn't hit early access yet and I'm not sure if they will even do that or just launch with the full game. This one will have a monster fusion system, and one of your creatures will follow you. Battles are turn based.

Toby's Island is in early access, I'm giving it more time before giving that one a try."

Asthma,fel90gk,t3_eposyh,1579216685.0,"Sometimes steroids are needed to get a cough like that under control and a doctor familiar with asthma is best at determining when they are needed. I had one doctor prescribe a much higher dose of the inhaled steroid than I usually take to get a cough like that under control. More commonly, they prescribe a pill type of steroid to get a cough like that under control. Both methods have helped, although the pills seem to have more side effects on me (obviously differs per person). 

Also agree with everyone saying you need to see a doctor that is familiar with asthma as you should probably be on a preventative inhaler, not just a rescue inhaler. A nebulizer for breathing treatments can be really helpful as well. That sometimes helps when the inhaler doesn't.

Good luck and I hope you feel better soon!"

Allergist confirmed allergies: chocolate, pepper (of all sorts black, bell, hot, etc..., safer just to avoid them), grape, melon, and almonds. Haven't confirmed these at the allergist yet, but foods shouldn't cause swelling or pain: cloves, raw celery, and chamomile.

It does feel like a disaster movie, you have the scientists that have been sounding the alarm for decades, the corporations and politicians that not only ignore the warnings, but spread misinformation so they can make more money, the heroes going the extra mile to try to get people to do something, many people suffering the consequences of ignoring the warnings, but it is a movie that would end with a lot of people dying and the protagonists facing an uncertain future due to the severity of the disaster."
AskReddit,fcnbfnr,t1_fcmlwnu,1577808028.0,I'd love to learn how to sew. I'm curious as to never having to throw stuff out though. What about when the material pretty much rots and tears apart without much effort at all?
AskReddit,fcnbbsd,t1_fcmpc9d,1577807956.0,"Still love lego, don't have space to display it, very frustrating."
aww,fcaze73,t1_fcay4qn,1577579627.0,"Very true that any dog could cause damage, just things I've read on why they are considered dangerous. Perhaps what I read is wrong, but still, any dog bred specifically to hunt or kill large animals make me somewhat nervous."
pokemon,fcaz06m,t1_fca4irn,1577579412.0,My first and second shiny were both randomly encountered ponyta in past games. Would need to go look to see what generations they were. Congrats on your shiny!!
aww,fcaxjdp,t1_fcafdxq,1577578584.0,"My fear of owning a pit bull is not so much that they are a violent breed, but if something does go wrong, they can do a lot of damage much faster than some other breeds. Having a small dog bite can do damage and really hurt, having a pit bull bite seriously may need a crowbar or worse to remove them due to being bred for jaw strength."

collapse,fc96vpm,t1_fc94p4p,1577547977.0,It probably depends on the area and the company. We ran into this when getting a mowing service for my grandparents when they no longer could do it themselves.
collapse,fc90e34,t1_fc8vx2x,1577545004.0,Agreed. We would also need to make it easy to get native plant seeds and encourage people to plant them. Then there's the problem of lawn services refusing to mow your lawn if you also don't let them kill your native plants as they consider them to be weeds they don't want to spread to yards that don't want them.
pokemon,fc6s7uw,t3_egd0lz,1577488152.0,The only one that isn't dragon type is the only one I think of as a dragon. Reminds me of fairy type pokemon really not fitting my concept of a fairy.
pokemon,fc6s41i,t3_egaxim,1577488073.0,I like everything other than the triangle shapes but can definitely see a theme going there. Love the design and the colors. Also like this more than pretty much all of the new pokemon in sword and shield. That generation's style really doesn't mesh with the type of designs I enjoy.
