I'll think about these scenes for up to days at a time, adding onto them, editing them, and adding new scenes in the same story/universe where the original scene takes place.

AskWomen,ff815re,t3_es5xho,1579663280.0,"I've never been in a relationship but I definitely feel differently.

If I like a guy I get really nervous and blush around them. I don't know what to do and the crushes are always annoying because when I'm around the guy I like, I feel nervous and on edge because I don't want to act word or say the wrong thing. It's not a pleasant experience.

So with guys, I get really intense crushes for short periods of time, like a couple weeks at most.

When I like a girl, it's an amazing feeling. I don't feel like it's my body being attracted to them and my mind struggling to catch up with how I'm feeling. I feel like I genuinely like them and appreciate them. Idk, it's just a softer, more blissful feeling if that makes sense. I don't get as nervous and I feel more of an emotional connection.

That being said, I tend to lean more towards girls, and I don't experience much or frequent sexual attraction (and even when I do the idea of doing anything sexual still grosses me out, even though my body clearly feels different, but my body doesn't control me). I experience romantic attraction though, and certainly more for girls. My ""fantasies"" are just cuddling and cute domestic stuff (ideally I would live in a cute cabin in the woods with a beautiful witch)."

Ah yes...because it would be much easier to hide a weapon up against your head under the hood where everyone would see the bulge, rather than in the hood when it’s off and hanging at the back of your neck.

I'm not saying that your feelings are invalid, because you mentioned having past trauma and that's not your fault.
