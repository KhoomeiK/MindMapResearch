I'm saying that cheating is a power play that is commonly used by abusers. Not that cheating makes you abusive, but it is, by it's very nature, a manipulative thing to do since it is a violation of a pact between two people, whether the pact is healthy or not. 

I feel like being in abusive relationship warps our reality, tears apart innocence, destroys our self respect, and can make us do things that our healthier selves would never have done."

Normally I wouldn't say this, I'd just smile and nod, but you explicitly stated that you know what you did would invoke mixed feelings, and you're right.

You sound more smug about cheating than proud about leaving, which strikes me as strange.

It's like borrowing a power play from the abuser handbook and then acting smug when you felt empowered by it, which is literally a typical abuser's motivation. Please dont turn your experience into another cycle of manipulation.

Therapy, meds, communication, self care.

He talked about his ""demons"" every time he snapped out of whatever stupid rage he was. He cried, pleaded, threatened suicide, but never got away from his past. 

He asked me the same question: how do I stop being abusive? I suggested therapy, medication, excersize, relaxing, working on how we communicate, walking away when angry, even using code words instead of begging him to stop.

My dad was my hero. But he was fatally flawed. He entirely measured his self worth on providing for his family, friends, and community. When his finances started slipping, he started to crack.

He developed a secret gambling addiction that no one knew about. He stopped eating. I think that he was notified he was being audited. He was deeply depressed.

He shot himself in our driveway one night, 15 feet from where I slept. 

Funny thing... he had left my mother and the 3 kids a ton of insurance money. I went to grad school with that money. My mom was able to keep the house and continue raising my younger siblings on an average salary, comfortably. 

My dad shot himself dead alone in his car at night because he thought it was the only way left to support us, and therefore be a good person.

Not that cheating makes you abusive, but it is, by it's very nature, a manipulative thing to do since it is a violation of a pact between two people, whether the pact is healthy or not. 

I feel like being in abusive relationship warps our reality, tears apart innocence, destroys our self respect, and can make us do things that our healthier selves would never have done."

Normally I wouldn't say this, I'd just smile and nod, but you explicitly stated that you know what you did would invoke mixed feelings, and you're right.

You sound more smug about cheating than proud about leaving, which strikes me as strange.

It's like borrowing a power play from the abuser handbook and then acting smug when you felt empowered by it, which is literally a typical abuser's motivation. Please dont turn your experience into another cycle of manipulation.

He developed a secret gambling addiction that no one knew about. He stopped eating. I think that he was notified he was being audited. He was deeply depressed.

He shot himself in our driveway one night, 15 feet from where I slept. 

Funny thing... he had left my mother and the 3 kids a ton of insurance money. I went to grad school with that money. My mom was able to keep the house and continue raising my younger siblings on an average salary, comfortably. 

My dad shot himself dead alone in his car at night because he thought it was the only way left to support us, and therefore be a good person.
