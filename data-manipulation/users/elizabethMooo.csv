Asthma,ffgmwa9,t1_ffgdfco,1579909944.0,"Yeah I agree. If anything being associated with vaping when I'm having a medical emergency would cause me more stress. I'm not against a redesign that would improve function, function over style is way more important in my opinion.
However when I was younger I did style my inhaler cases, and wouldn't take it less serious if you could put little stickers or somthing on them. Maybe make them cute for kids. Even as a kid though I was never embarrassed needing to use it."

chronicfatigue,ff6rz21,t3_ery4ig,1579633643.0,"I'm the same way however with my other health issues I cant do dairy and veggies are becoming an issue now. I dont really like red meats but chicken is  somthing i eat and can tolerate and i think i have felt a little better eatting it. I can understand not wanting too switch over to meats yet but if nothing else works it may be worth a try. I'm sure you tried but eatting a lot of beans, nuts, things like that to make up for it that have protein is always an option. I find though you have to eat a lot to make a differnce. 
I would think it might be worth a try if it could help you feel better. I got to the point where I would try anything to feel better.

Allergies,ff5l7db,t3_erqzms,1579598273.0,"You can totally be allergic to carrots. Sometimes allergy tests can fail. It depends on which test they did. I'm allergic to pineapples but my first ever patch test said I wasn't. You know your body and recreation better than anyone so trust that. You could try an allergist now that your an adult, you might get different results. If you can take something for the itch I would, no need to suffer. If you start wheezing, have a  hard time swallowing or just  feel worse always go to the er. Allergies are no joke and always better to be safe. I hope you feel better!"

I hope you can figure out what to do without much more stress. Sending my love to your family."
Allergies,ff42pub,t3_erh563,1579554251.0,"So I have horrible allergies. Awful nothing helps. I'm allergic to dogs as one of my triggers. Didnt know this at the time but We had 2 border collies growing up and I struggled for years. I even got asthma. Having grown up with them I wouldnt want to change it now but looking back it was really hard feeling so bad all the time. You havent had the dog too long and I know it's really hard because you fall in love instantly to them so rehoming is a last option.

You could look into trying allergy shots to become  more tolerant of the dog. It didnt work for me but does for a lot of people. Or perhaps a differnt form of treatment. It may take time. I just think long run if she cant get relief rehoming would be best for her health. :( I'm sorry I hope she can get relief and feel better."

Asthma,fefvt29,t1_fefrzgg,1579066824.0,Yeah I think it might help. It honestly could be reflux or somthing else but I dont mess with breathing issues.

I was checked for reflux, sleep apnea, and nocturnal asthma also which all can make you wheeze at night laying flat. It's possible you may have somthing like that. You could also try sleeping on your side."
Asthma,feeuzd7,t3_eorr9x,1579041786.0,Yup I have the same issue. My pulmonologist says it's because my lung  get crowded laying down and cant expand fully. Do you sleep with a pillow?

Dentistry,fdxigxk,t1_fdx7r0h,1578769009.0,"Yeah honestly it's a pain. It started over a year ago randomly. I have a lot of health issues and they have no idea what caused it. Neurology thinks it maybe related to that but they really dont know. So I've been on pills for reflux, stress, neuro, cardio.. honestly all differnt meds and nothing has helped it. At this point I'm just suppose to deal with it unless it gets so bad I cannot eat or drink. 

I get stressed when I'm having a bad flare up because i always am afraid it is allergy related. But some days are better than others.  However my dr. Said its differnt triggers for differnt people. So if yours is triggered by stress then maybe anxiety medication would help you? I do agree that stress can make it worse. Have you talked to a dr. About yours?"

You are not unworthy and I'm happy you got to where you did and fought for yourself. Your problems are just as valid as mine and anyone else's. I am happy you got the accommodations and I hope you always use them  when needed.  I would almost always feel embarrassed by needing to use the room and time.
