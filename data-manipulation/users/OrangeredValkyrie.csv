Men are considered disposable for war, dangerous jobs, basically more violent things. Women are considered disposable for things considered to be a womanâ€™s role: being pretty (very few big actresses and models are over 40), childbirth (anti-abortion sentiment partially stems from a severe lack of empathy for women as individuals, treating them instead as if theyâ€™re fulfilling their purpose by giving birth), â€œwomenâ€™s jobsâ€ (nurses are predominantly women and are worked far more than they should be with ridiculous hours and expectations, mothers are expected not only to work but also keep the house and look after the kids without any real appreciation or compensation, secretaries are another predominantly female field and are essential to running a large business but are expected to do a lot for a little while also being beautiful), and probably others I canâ€™t think of off the top of my head.
