As a former bedwetter, THIS IS MY NIGHTMARE! This definitely happened as a child, and as an adult I'll occasionally (rarely thankfully) have a dream where I have to pee like crazy. I've had dreams where I find a bathroom, but it's really a locker room with dozens of toilets but no stalls/dividers and there's lots of people around, OR the ones with dividers are really short or disgusting and look like the toilets from Trainspotting. Then there's always a few more slightly private toilets but they're in the back of the locker room where the lights don't work and it's really dingy and there's no toilet paper and I can't tell if I should really be back there. So I'm running around trying to decide what to do - then I get the idea that this is so ridiculous that maybe I'm dreaming BUT I REALLY HAVE TO GO BAD!!! So when I commit, now I'm second guessing myself that I'm actually going to wet the bed to I try to pee just a little in my dream to see if I wake up in real life, but then I'm afraid I'm going to pee too much and then people start coming closer and I know they're gong to judge me for taking too long to pee....

For that to happen, while sitting in the bladder water would have to be removed. Our bodies don't work that way.

Morning pee is more concentrated because when we're sleeping our kidneys get rid of less excess water. It's still sending waste to the bladder, but just with less water (otherwise we'd be wetting the bed or not sleeping as well because we'd have to get up every few hours.) During waking hours our kidneys are more free with getting rid of the excess water. In fact, every time you eat or drink something it can have an effect on the contents of the next time you pee!

Fun fact - caffeine and alcohol interfere with a hormone called ADH (anti-diuretic hormone). ADH tells our body to retain water. Drinking alcohol or caffeine interfere with the production of ADH, which means that we'll end up producing more urine than usual.

Do you have an explanation for where this mysterious quart of not-urine is being produced and then where it is being collected? Having taken multiple anatomy classes and taught it, I'd appreciate the additional information.

BTW - you give your kidneys very little credit. Healthy kidneys are constantly producing urine which automatically drains into the bladder. When we consume more water than our bodies need (and water in food counts as well) our kidneys simply let it pass through where it is delivered to the bladder as urine. When pregnant women go in for ultrasounds, they're instructed to drink extra water starting an hour prior to the appointment to fill the bladder to put the uterus in a better position. This can become quite uncomfortable BECAUSE our kidneys are so efficient and can send that extra water out fast, making holding it the entire time potentially painful. According to your math, they need to start drinking extra the previous day?

Our current understanding of anatomy and physiology reasonably and realistically explains that this is simply urine... until such point new anatomical structures or processes are discovered which explain it better, should that day ever happen. If it does, I'll gladly correct myself."

If you didn't prepare it, have you had that brand or eaten it from that restaurant before? It could be a sensitivity or allergy to something in the food, or maybe one of the ingredients used was bad, or cross contamination of that dish with something else? 

The same dish from different places can sometimes contain some random ingredient that can be an issue. I love kung po chicken and have had it from multiple places, BUT I can't eat it from Panda Express. For some reason when I've gotten it from there, my mouth and throat tingle and itch uncomfortably - worse the second time than the first. This is a pretty classic sign of a food allergy, so I just don't get that dish from there. Ignoring allergy symptoms can lead to increasingly serious reactions with each exposure.

AskReddit,fct8cvz,t1_fct32gq,1577935577.0,"It depends heavily on where you're located. 

To be able to provide touch - If you're in the States, all but a few have some form of state license and educational requirements to provide massage. Educational requirements vary wildly from state to state, but the basic idea is to be sure that therapists have enough basic education to touch another person safely and weed out those with concerning criminal histories. Depending on the area and the requirements I've seen programs that vary from 7 months to 2 years. If you have the desire to do this, the education should not be seen as a hurdle but as preparation. 

Other ways to serve would be to volunteer. There are programs that utilize volunteers for non-skilled purposes, such as supporting the patient and their family to sit with the patient, keep them company, read to them, play cards, help with light household chores, help with meal preparation... the list goes on. 

Whichever direction you'd go, you'll need to remember to take care of yourself in the process. Working with hospice patients BY DEFINITION means that in all likelihood, the person you're meeting will die soon. Hospice is determined appropriate for those with less than 6 months to live. Some only last a few days after entry, but there's a few that we have that have been in the program for a year (progressing at a slower than predicted rate or lingering.) You need to have healthy boundaries to fill the role you're taking on. (There's a book for massage therapists called ""The Educated Heart"" which is a great resource regarding ethics and boundaries.) What helps me mentally and emotionally is understanding that while I'm entering a very sensitive situation, my place is to provide support and work to improve the quality of their remaining life. I'm not there to ""fix"" anything, and nothing I do will change the circumstances. What I CAN do is provide comfort, and families often feel better knowing that everything that can be done for comfort, is being done.

That speaks volumes. Without getting all deep on ya (forgive me if I'm verbose) I'll just say that one of the foundational points we taught in ethics, is that everyone has their own touch history. A person's touch history encompasses not only who has touched them throughout their lives, but how they were touched and the circumstances around that touch - be it family, friends, medical professionals, that cashier at the grocery store that pinched your cheek too hard every time your mom brought you in, an unwanted slap on the ass, wrestling with friends, tickling, being in crowded situations... basically any and all contact with others and what kind of experience you took away from it. 

Back to anatomy a moment - your nervous system is always monitoring your safety. ""Is something going to eat me? Am I safe? Everything cool? Ok, we can chill."" If it perceives something threatening (whether you're conscious of it or not) then your ""fight or flight"" kicks in to get you out of that situation. In some cases, this can be experienced as some kind of discomfort - it's your brain's way of trying to convince you to get out of that situation. Knowing that during a massage you are 100% in control of where and how you are touched in time can help teach the nervous system to be less sensitive, and understand that you are safe and in control. Hopefully in time those first touches become more tolerable, and potentially one day more enjoyable. :)

Regarding use of superficial touch, some people can't tolerate much stimulation. With some hospice patients, the act of applying lotion in a gliding manner can become overstimulating and make them agitated. Sometimes I'm not doing much more than resting my hands on a body part and warming that area. Many things are done in slow motion (patients with poor vision, hearing, or dementia can be easily startled) and their skin can become delicate and sometimes tears easily. But even if they're non-verbal, a sigh, closing their eyes, humming, relaxing, and falling asleep can be signs that they're still enjoying it."

That said, over the years I've had the opportunity to receive many different types of touch, and have found that even some of my ""less preferred"" types of touch can be quite enjoyable done the right way under the right circumstances. For example, tapotement is a method of rhythmically drumming/chopping/slapping the body. It was the one technique that I REALLY disliked, and not a favorite among a number of therapists I've talked to. Then one day a massage student was practicing on me and I actually enjoyed it - I realized that I didn't hate the technique, but I just hadn't received it in a way that I'd liked yet. 

As far as the anatomical aspect, we have different types of sensory receptors (mechanoreceptors) in our skin that measure mechanical changes like vibration, stretch, light pressure and heavy pressure. Using more pressure during a massage doesn't actually achieve anything other than fulfilling a preference for that sensation. Best case scenario it feels good, worst case - if someone is already experiencing pain, at some point excessive pressure can create irritation or injury to the nervous system/tissues and prolong pain. 

Lately I've been thinking to myself and wondering if people who really enjoy lots of pressure might have a different appreciation for weighted blankets. Wondering if that would somehow help fulfill the desire for that pressure ""fix"" but in a less intense manner."
