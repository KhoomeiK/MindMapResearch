raisedbynarcissists,ffdcpv4,t3_eszdo4,1579818104.0,"I've also had the thought of the same concept but for less serious purposes and instead of finding people to form real connections with it'd be more like a rent-a-friend service. Like how people rent a best man or someone to cry at a funeral, you could also rent a family to fill in for something and not have to worry about everything that comes with not inviting them, like ""where's your mom?"" ""Why didn't you invite her?"" Or the potential hazards of inviting them. Personally, I hate being in public with my mom and I especially hate introducing her to people in my life. Her negativity is toxic and embarrassing."
raisedbynarcissists,ffdau40,t1_ffd9o7f,1579816873.0,I agree with you. I have friends like that too and a couple of them are more motherly figures in my life and I love them and I'm so grateful to have them in my life. I just think about the concept of that idea from time to time and wanted to know what other people thought. But no matter what I know it wouldn't be the same. I guess I'm just still struggling accepting the fact that I was robbed of the typical mother-daughter relationship. I hate how hard I am working to become the person I want to be at almost 30 instead of being raised to be the person I want to be. It's hard breaking out of that autopilot robotic shell of a person you have to become when you're surviving life with a narcissist.
raisedbynarcissists,ffd5ubw,t1_ffd36sg,1579814002.0,"It's just sad that when people like us try to vent or even just talk about our parents in general and the reactions from people who don't understand. I don't want to feel the way I do about my mom and I would give anything to have a ""normal"" relationship and bond with her. Hell, sometimes I even wish I was still blind to the narcissism and the way she is and maybe I would still have those feelings for my mom that other people have for theirs. It's just heartbreaking to hear people talking about how they don't know how they'll survive when their mom dies or blah blah blah and I have to sit here with my feelings knowing that the day my nmom dies will be the ultimate relief and instead of being afraid to lose her, I'm afraid everyone is going to think I'm the biggest piece of shit because her death isn't going to affect me the way people expect. 

That's another thing, people EXPECT you to love your parents no matter what, because ""they love you"". I do envy the people who don't understand but at the same time I wish there was a way to make them understand."

Bankruptcy,fefl3fk,t3_eow413,1579058621.0,"I used upsolve and I loved it but I also don't really have any assets. I tried one diy type of website that charged me for the forms and I couldn't even figure out what I was doing. I was going to go through an attorney but I couldn't afford it and also had the issue of the paperwork kicking my butt. Upsolve cost me the $335 filing fee and then the two courses that were about $16 each and I flew through the forms in a day. I do think an attorney would have been helpful in some ways. I had a lot of questions I couldn't get direct answers for and a lot of my questions were answered by people who have previously filed but I don't know how credible my sources were. I did have a couple people tell me they don't start looking at taking any of your assets until you hit $50,000 in assets. 

Anyways, I definitely recommend upsolve. Sorry if this wasn't very helpful. Another tip though, when I was going to use an attorney, the advisor told me if it's this close to tax season wait to start your bankruptcy stuff until after you file your taxes and if you get a tax return don't have it deposited into your main accounts and use a NetSpend card or something like that."

I was living with my nmom at age 26 and I felt like I was a grounded 16 year old. I couldn't go anywhere or do anything without some kind of questioning or guilt trip. I couldn't even go to bed when I wanted without a guilt trip. Anyways, I finally started looking for my own place and I looked at one place but couldn't meet with the landlord for two weeks. I kept asking my grandma how to tell my mom or if I should tell her and my grandma kept telling me to just not say anything until I know for sure......two weeks later I met with the landlord, signed my lease, and paid my first months rent. I told my grandma and her response was ""OMG your mom is gonna flip, you should have said something!"" She then advised me to text my mom and tell her. So I did. And it was ugly. My mother still expected me to pay rent and I also had to restrain her because she was trying to hit me. After that she ran to my grandparents house and told my grandpa that I hit her!!

 Just out of curiosity, how many siblings do you have? Are only one of them narcissistic?  I'm youngest of 3 girls on my Nmom's side. My oldest sister is amazing. Everything a sister should be. Unfortunately, she's 9 years older so I didn't have the kind of exposure to her when I needed it the most. My other sister is 7 years older. She's evil. If I could cut all ties with her I would. Conveniently, the bitch popped out two of her own that she didn't want to raise. Her girls are my world and she's the most toxic person in my life, worse than my Nmom, and to distance myself from her means I have to distance myself from my nieces and it's sucks. My oldest sister doesn't even claim her. When people ask she's says she only has 1 sister.
There's things that have fallen on my shoulders and become my responsibility specifically because I'm the youngest, and there's also a theory that my nsis is the way she is because she's the middle child but I also wonder if it's hereditary. So that's why I get curious about people with an nparent and nsib."

agnostic,fcs13hl,t3_eij8k3,1577909777.0,"I used to but my sister kinda eased that fear for me. I was going off to her about how I can't just pretend to believe in something that I don't but what if I believe in the wrong thing and go to hell and spend eternity reliving the worst moment of my life over and over again or something worse and just all sorts of anxiety I had about hell and the apocalypse. I know I'm a good person but is that going to be enough on judgement day if I went with the wrong belief system? I grew up in a very small and very LDS community and my family was one of the few non-religious. Kids I went to school with told me I was going to hell because I watched the Simpsons and my mom was a smoker. They would also talk about how they're not allowed to have caffeine (idk if that's a real LDS thing or if that was just their parents) but still, I was like am I really gonna go to hell for drinking mtn dew even though I've never stolen, murdered, etc.? 
Anyways, my sister told me to stop worrying about it because even with all the different beliefs in the world, no one really knows. And if it does come down to judgement day, no matter what beliefs you had up until then, as long as you don't deny god to his face you'll be good. The way she said it confused me and I was ready to rant again and she asked ""if the world was ending right now and god was standing right in front of asking if you believed and accept him, would you?"" I said ""yeah if I knew it was god then absolutely."" 
She said ""then it doesn't really matter what you believe now.""

This was years ago. For the most part I don't worry about it the way I used to.
