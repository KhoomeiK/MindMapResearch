doggohate,fempvd9,t3_eprxud,1579266068.0,As much as I hate baby yoda. I’m hating the people who think baby yodas cute. I don’t particularly care for baby yoda. However r/babyyodahate have a tendency for wanting to kill him. So maybe they are a tad aggressive. That’s just my take

I’m not agreeing with him however a lot of the post on this subreddit are extremely bland and unfunny and I think it’s best we acknowledge that. If you scroll the the comments/captions. You might notice how they have a common trend of just saying ‘Murica’ or ‘USA’ without context. All I’m saying is, don’t just insult someone without acknowledging what they said"
