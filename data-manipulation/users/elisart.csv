Really beautiful drawing."
politics,ffcqrcp,t1_ffcpu1b,1579805291.0,"Oh god that hit and run of the UK citizen prolly doesn't help - just awful. 

Unlike his military father Philip, who placed Charles in Gordonstoun, Scotland where there's now allegations of child abuse, Charles placed Harry and William in Eton college near Windsor in Berkshire. To keep the boys closer to home. Charles is a gentle wise soul. Likely because of him and the lovely Diana, William and Harry turned out as proper gents."
JoeBiden,ffcpttf,t1_ffbjgm6,1579804671.0,"Yes I agree. Biden should hit Sanders fast and hard several times on lax gun legislation. If we count the number of deaths from gun violence (mass shootings and suicides) over the last couple decades, I believe it rivals that of civilian and military casualties of the recent Iraq war. I'm not joking. America's gun violence is at ridiculous levels and needs to be addressed."
JoeBiden,ffcoihd,t3_esuvl7,1579803842.0,"Absolutely brilliant article, thanks for posting. This article is the answer to anyone asking why we love Biden for Prez in 2020. Highly recommend reading this a time or two.

Edit to add: Biden's commitment to improving education has never been more relevant when you think a fifth of american population thought 45 was a good idea. If that doesn't speak to a failing education system I don't know what does"
politics,ffcl4zg,t3_esvska,1579801779.0,"Again, I'm on a media black-out for 45 and his sycophants, but if you'll permit me an un-related comment, Mnuchin should get a chin."
politics,ffcl1a3,t1_ffci888,1579801715.0,Please. Make. This. Happen.
politics,ffckpr9,t3_eswf8t,1579801524.0,It's so ironic that someone who suffers from the worst brain injury I've ever seen is down playing this impairment.
politics,ffckmma,t1_ffck9qw,1579801470.0,Excellent! Prince Charles has been an environmentalist for decades and likely would rather stick needles in his eyes than shake hands with anyone in the current administration.
UpliftingNews,ffcgvop,t1_ffcfany,1579799190.0,I deleted the post. Not many people get my sense of humor. Sorry you didn't enjoy it. Have a great day.
politics,ffcef11,t1_ffcd1ht,1579797678.0,I love your username - made me chuckle
politics,ffcbvc8,t3_esuhms,1579796092.0,"I'm prolly going to get 100 downvotes like I do ever time I say something bernie bots don't like but let's face it. Black people are cool. And black people like cool. And Bernie is not cool. 

Biden, on the other hand, is calm and cool. He speaks calmly. He doesn't gesticulate like a madman when he talks. He drives cool cars. Are you digging this?"
politics,ffcbk4h,t1_ffc84y0,1579795897.0,"It was never really ""news"" to me. Media fabricated drama. Move along, nothing to see here."
politics,ffcbei5,t3_esurzu,1579795800.0,"Can't read the article b/c I'm on a definite media block-out on several Repugs, but man, just looking at his face, screams Kate McKinnon!!! Lots and lots more of Kate McKinnon please."

MrRobot,ffcawti,t3_espalb,1579795486.0,"LOL awesome post, all teary eyed."
politics,ffb97fj,t3_esobic,1579755795.0,"Yes the witness no lawyer wants ... who just loves to blah blah blah. Today 45 was also talking about needing to protect genius people like Edison who invented the light bulb. Aside from obvious concerns about mental health, they had a great big belly laugh on msnbc about ‘learning Edison had passed’."
politics,ffb6mk7,t1_ffb6dra,1579753199.0,I would take time off work to see this spectacle.
