For stars that are close to us, yes. For those that are very far away (which is most of them), you wouldn't notice a change for hundreds of thousands, or even millions of years. Remember that one galactic year (i.e. the time it takes for the solar system to make one orbit) is a quarter of a *billion* years.

It kind of like looking at a mountain peak a hundred miles away. If you move twenty feet to the left or right, will the mountain appear to move? Obviously not. The stars are so massively far away, that even the very fast (to us) motion of the solar system is not enough to perceive any change.

exAdventist,ferpfp0,t3_eqdpks,1579356853.0,"There is a pretty simple answer if you think about it...

The very earliest reference to the Book of Daniel is about 150 BC, if we assume that the reference in the Sybiline Oracles is original (and that's very much disputed). The earliest *undisputed* reference would be in 1 Maccabees, and that is from about 100 BC. Prior to that, history is completely silent about the book. For example, [Ecclesiasticus 44ff](https://www.bible.com/bible/546/SIR.44.KJVA) written about 200 BC contains references to almost all known OT books. Daniel is not among them.

Also, the history of the Babylonian and Persian periods is replete with errors. Even the opening verse gets the date of the Siege of Jerusalem wrong. Babylon fell to Cyrus the Great - not Darius the Mede. In fact, no such person is ever mentioned anywhere. Belshazzar was the son of Nabonidus, not Nebuchadnezzar. The Madness of Nebuchadnezzar is never mentioned in any historical record. However, something very similar happened to Nabonidus. It seems that whoever wrote the book got Nebuchadnezzar and Nabonidus confused.

In contrast, the history of the Greek period is detailed and highly accurate - up to a point. And that point is 164 BC. After this, the 'prophecy' goes off the rails and predicts events that never happened.

It should be pretty obvious that the book does not date from the Babylonian period, but from the Greek era several centuries later."

learnSQL,fejmpld,t3_ephzcq,1579180075.0,"What you have listed there are actually RDBMSs (Relational Database Management Systems), not technically SQL. There is a [standard for SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp) itself, and pretty much all the RDBMSs will implement most of it. This means that SQL itself will generally be portable across different vendors.

However, each vendor has their own SQL automation languages (usually called stored procedures and functions). Microsoft has T-SQL, Oracle uses PL/SQL and some don't have automation at all but provide libraries for use in third-party tools (Python, Java etc.) In this case, the SQL programming languages differ from each other quite a lot.

Also, actual database administration will obviously differ between vendors as well. That means that the methods you use to create and manage users, assign storage for tables etc. will differ quite a lot between RDBMSs.

So, if your aim is to just learn SQL, then pretty much any RDBMS will work, and the basic commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE etc.) will be mostly portable across systems. If you want to get deeper into SQL automation itself, then you will want to pick one of the more popular databases. Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft SQL are probably the top three in this regard. Same for database administration. MySQL might be best to start with, since it is open source and won't cost you anything."

No matter how much evidence we have, there is always a non-zero chance that any theory could be totally wrong. The entire aim of science is to make that probability as close to zero as possible, but it can never reach exactly zero. The more evidence a theory gathers, and the more accurate predictions it makes, the smaller the probability of wrongness becomes.

Also, different theories have different levels of probability when it comes to being 'correct'. For example, we are pretty sure that semiconductor theory is right, because computers and the internet are a thing. Same with evolution - every piece of evidence we have gathered to date supports the notion of common descent, and we can see its effects in everyday life. We are on the verge of losing antibiotics altogether, because bacteria are critters and critters evolve.

There is still some uncertainty when it comes to gravity. We know precisely how it affects reality, and we can accurately predict how much force a given mass will exert due to gravity, but ti's still not exactly clear precisely *what* gravity is. Is is a fundamental force, like electro-magnetism? Or is it a property of matter that bends space? Or some combination of both? We don't know yet.

AcademicBiblical,feag7b2,t1_fe9em71,1578948306.0,"I have seen some authors take the view that the Bible writers accepted the prevailing mythology of the era and wrote from a 'phenomenological' point of view (i.e. the earth appears to be flat and the sun and moon appear to be close, so that it what they accepted).

(The NJB study Bible takes a similar view of Genesis 1 - they accept that the 'firmament' refers to a solid dome that housed the sun and moon, but presumably will not see that as fatal to the doctrine of Biblical inspiration).

Similarly, Marduk constructed the sky from the remains of *tiamat* as told in the Babylonian creation story.

The flood story, then, is creation in more-or-less reverse order. It is the story of God temporarily 'uncreating' the world by allowing *tehom* to intrude, both from above (the windows in the firmament) and below (the springs of the 'great deep'). Necessarily, then, the flood must have encompassed the entire world, since the original purpose of the firmament was to hold back the waters of *tehom*, and reversing that order would be an all-or-nothing act."

For the first few decades or so, paying for software was something of a strange concept, especially in the hobbyist community. Obviously, large companies like IBM leased their software to big companies for equally large sums of money, but the home computer movement was built around the concept of freely available and shared code. In fact, in 1976 Bill Gates famously [wrote an open letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists) to the community in which he reminded them that some software was supposed to be licensed.

We're seeing something of a return to that now. Increasingly, more and more high quality software is being released as open source or proprietary but free. A very large percentage of the web runs on completely open source software, and pretty much all large companies run Linux servers and use free or open source compilers and IDEs for much of their work. Even Microsoft got in on the act and has now released community versions of much of their development toolchain.

Increasingly, more companies are making money from selling services rather than software. For example, you can build a distributed application on AWS using pretty much only open source tools.

That's what I'm saying. I'm passing over the possibility that God exists and used evolution as the means to create life. That is a different question, and is not a position generally taken by Creationists in any case.

If we consider the evangelical interpretation of the NT, we arrive at the conclusion that God ordained an eternal and quite horrific punishment for those who reject him. It follows then that he must have left incontrovertible evidence that he exists and that those who fail to accept that evidence are fully to blame for their own predicament. This is precisely what Romans 1:20 asserts.

But...the reality is quite different. Not only has he not pointed out which of the dizzyingly large number of religions is correct, he hasn't even arranged life in a way that obviously points to special creation. This flies in the face of the 'without excuse' assertion, and results in a deceptive, possibly quite insane deity who will punish people for, essentially, failing to guess correctly."
DebateEvolution,fd378nk,t3_ejsj26,1578155364.0,"The common design argument fails to account for the 'why' question.

God could presumably have chosen to create life in any way that he wanted. Why did he choose the one way that happens to match the predictions made by common descent? Natural selection can only make small, gradual changes to existing structures. This constraint means that life must exhibit certain characteristics. For example, we expect that body structures will be reused across species, even when those structures may be used for different things, such as climbing, swimming or flying. We would expect to find a very large number of variations on a relatively small number of body plans. We expect that life would be arranged in a nested hierarchy.

Put another way, evolution can be falsified in a number of different ways. But of all those ways, God chose to implement precisely none. Had he created radically different structures for the different forms of locomotion, the theory of evolution would be in trouble. If he had created life with a myriad of different body plans, with no obvious hierarchy, the theory of common descent would arguably have never seen the light of day.

The common design assertion leads inexorably to the Trickster God thesis. We can only conclude that God knew that the shape of life would result in a naturalistic theory of common descent, *but chose to do it anyway*.

> For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse. (Romans 1:20)

The common design argument, ironically, directly contradicts the Bible. How are we 'without excuse' if we arrive at a conclusion that God himself apparently intended?"
