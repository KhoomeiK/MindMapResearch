Beyond the standard training, most see a pretty frequent number of cases as well helping differentiate between types. I just responded because there is a lot of misdiagnosing that goes on in the psychiatric community and just opening it up without any consideration could make that problem worse. Still an important part of treatment though!"
Foodforthought,fdop4bw,t1_fdnuoe8,1578609738.0,"I just looked at some schedules for family medicine rotations in the us and of the four I looked at, only 1 (USC Keck) actually did a psych rotation for half a block their second year. That is also definitely not the case for all interns, anything procedural probably doesn't and definitely not any surgical program. 

As for comparing it to the basics of other diseases, depression doesn't have clean biomarkers like the things you mentioned. You can get blood work that gives an affirmative or not for those diseases. Psychiatric illness however present themselves in a lot of different ways. Hopefully sooner rather than later they will be easier to diagnose, but until then I think more training is needed for the basics as well."

Foodforthought,fdnqo1a,t1_fdnn5ig,1578590984.0,"Except for the scenario where misleading symptoms are incorrectly diagnosed leading to prescription, which comes with it negative side effects hurting the situation. The training is pretty lackluster. I don't think general practitioners even do a psychiatric rotation during residency. If primary care is the answer (which I do agree it looks like the best one) than the training is nowhere near good enough"

The biggest thing isn't age, but rather making sure you have all your ducks in a row for applying and that it's something you really want to do (It's a butt ton of your life you're commiting)!"
