penpalsover30,ffkczeq,t3_eu0y20,1580020739.0,"Hey! I also like Disney and sci-fi/fantasy and stationary, and I think I’m a pretty good pen pal. I’m 31/F in the PNW. Edit: I promise I’m not trying to sell you anything, salvation, lipstick or anything in between, lol. I am curious about your life in your 40s without kids if it’s not too nosy (I don’t plan on having any)"

ChoosingBeggars,fek037b,t1_fej5euk,1579189728.0,What the heck? I have more than 300 and I’m a random human who keeps my Instagram set to private. This lady is delusional.
TuxedoCats,feivmvn,t3_epcv8o,1579148444.0,He’s got terminal baby disease!
bulletjournal,feijpdq,t1_feicko8,1579140105.0,Yeah! I know it can be really intimidating starting out as you’re trying to figure out what exactly works for you. Don’t be afraid of the imperfections as you’re figuring it out! :)
bulletjournal,feiai5p,t3_ep04xt,1579133959.0,How’d it go?

bujo,fe3g5ae,t3_enooiu,1578848984.0,"I have a table on the back of each monthly spread with a column for: wash bill, how much it is, whether or not I’ve paid it, and then a big empty space where I put any math I need to do. On my phone I have a document that has each category I save for (car, gifts, entertainment, food, etc.) that is just a total in each category and then a list of amounts I spent in that category. That would be easy to add into a spread, I think."
Calligraphy,fdr3eei,t3_emri5l,1578678931.0,Where do you find ink samples???
bujo,fdgrrj2,t1_fdg7ix5,1578406639.0,You’re welcome! If you search by “French” on Netflix there’s actually a mulch of them!
askwomenadvice,fdg7ly1,t3_el7mjl,1578383368.0,Start with a random chunk from the middle. Eventually you’ll have enough that it will be easy to string them together with a couple of transitions and then all of a sudden you have a huge chunk and that in itself is motivating.
bujo,fdfcpyr,t3_ekvsxe,1578358607.0,I love the geode!
bujo,fdf8zyg,t1_fdf773f,1578356107.0,That’s an awesome idea! I love it! Edit: maybe that macaron subscription box I really want but haven’t been able to justify lol
bujo,fde9qfb,t3_ekxrnb,1578334282.0,"I majored in French for my undergrad, but since I’ve come home, it’s really hard to practice, and I’m worried I’ll lose it all. One good way to practice is to watch tv shows and movies in the target language, so I made a spread to organize some of those. I included a small key so that I can reward myself for not getting lazy and using English subtitles by crossing each episode off extra when I watch it with French subtitles."
bujo,fdcga7w,t1_fdcdcpy,1578274171.0,"Thank you! I really liked it! I’m midway through Wicked King now and really liking it. I’m glad too, because I put them on my Christmas list on a whim."

bujo,fd7oytg,t1_fd7oowb,1578207835.0,HA! Maybe for next year’s tracker...
bujo,fd4mn78,t1_fd4lgwb,1578168953.0,Ha! Sometimes it’s forest for the trees and all that. :) good luck!
bujo,fd4gemc,t1_fd4dyn5,1578167268.0,"I make mine up as I go along, but I also follow about every lettering or calligraphy subreddit and I practice a lot (doodling in cursive throughout every meeting etc), I find that over time I’m like “hmmm i like the shape of that persons ‘a’ better than mine” and then I play with it until it works for me, so it changes gradually over time."
bujo,fd39xs0,t1_fd154lk,1578156180.0,Thank you! Sometimes it doesn’t feel like I progress at all so that’s really nice to hear. :)

bulletjournal,fcyliu4,t1_fcylg7p,1578082225.0,Thank you! I find it’s super helpful to track patterns in my cycle.
bulletjournal,fcvvf2k,t3_ej451c,1578010983.0,Me too! Exactly my goal!
bulletjournal,fcvtwy1,t1_fcvtt7i,1578010014.0,Exactly! I find that thinking about how to sum up the day in one sentence really helps me narrow down my main moods too.
bulletjournal,fcvtnlh,t1_fcvkbqd,1578009847.0,I really enjoy it. Plus it’s cool to go back and read about little daily things I had forgotten about in previous months.
