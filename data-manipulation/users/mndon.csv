Almost made it thru the mogul field. The whole time while in there, back seating it and seeing my legs pumping away to the bumps. Trying my ass to get forward again to gain control. Only to thankful spin out in my right side after the field of bumps. One ski popped off at the end so not awarding winning yard sale. 

The ppl in the lift got a show. I was ok except for a lightly bruised right quad. 

My buddy was amazing I made it as far as I did. 

So lesson learned."
