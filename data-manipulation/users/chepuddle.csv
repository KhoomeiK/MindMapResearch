I inquired because I would like to have more snails but dont want to go down the constant egg watching cycle again! I was hoping different types would be able to cohabitate without reproducing...?"

dashcamgifs,fe01unb,t1_fdzzbtv,1578800982.0,I got hit by a wrong way driver in Portland 8ish years ago and nothing ever came of it either. Totaled my car but he had no insurance and I only had liability so it didn't matter.

Randomly when I'm doing those things and thinking how they suck I remember that my parents did it for me, not because I wasnt capable but because they loved me. I don't know, I lost my dad last year to cancer and it put a lot of things into perspective for sure."
