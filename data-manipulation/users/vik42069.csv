RepTronics,ff8v7hf,t1_ff8uo1k,1579697214.0,Even the best airpod clones aren't nearly as reliable as real ones + no warranty so it's easy that just threw away 30‚Ç¨ for some fakes. Imagine the same but with some 120‚Ç¨ bose fakes when you could have bought a genuine one (maybe even second hand) for 150/200‚Ç¨
RepTronics,ff8u95u,t1_ff8tyho,1579696283.0,"Reps of mid-/high-end electronics don't work reliable enough to be worth it. If you buy some Airpod reps for 30‚Ç¨, even if they Break after 2 weeks, that doesn't matter. 
Sonos for example also has a very specific technology and OS that isn't so easy to copy, same with Marshall/bose. 
For real, just Stick to the Originals or get some Teufel/JBL stuff"

kratom,fdarhv1,t3_ekfndy,1578249269.0,"I got a simple recipe for that 

Half a tablespoon pepper 
A bit of Chili and muscat power 
Half a squeezed lemon
Half a tablespoon cinnamon
Half a tbls raw cocoa powder

Mix all those up in a cup and put some boiling water on it, let the kratom dissolve and the ""tea"" cool down. Stir it up a bit and down the throat. You might gonna burp up the taste but not the powder luckily. Side effect : all those herbs will improve your tea when it comes to taste(Chili and pepper that cover up the taste), absorpability (mainly pepper/piperin that helps your stomach to properly digest it). I forgot what those others are for but can just look it up at eve&rave"
