So there's always a chance you will click the wrong one on your first go and be put back to level 1.

I don't get how VF avoided the laws. It's still gambling. It's just minesweeper gambling instead of slot machines or blackjack. But I don't get the laws.

Basically, I'm cheating. But that's only because I don't want to play voltorb flip for 12 hours a day for the next month. It's honestly shocking to me that the game could ship that way though. They clearly did no balancing at all. Voltorb flip cannot be completely solved, there is always risk, no matter how good you are. So a run of bad luck could literally mean weeks of grinding. And this is a kid's game too. Like, kids are not going to be good enough at voltorb flip for it to take any less than weeks. And who would even want to play voltorb flip that much? You'd be playing it more than the actual game.

There's also voltorb flip calculators out there that would help anyone on DS, but they're pretty far from perfect.

But honestly, the worst part about it is that you can't buy coins. In the original game corner in gen 1, you could fight the E4 for some money, level up your pokemon, evolve some to fill up your pokedex, and you'd get the money to buy coins. In Heart Gold, you HAVE to play voltorb flip. It's the only way. And the prices of TMs actually increased."

White guys started to dress in black clothes, and speak like black people.

So, when you're a grievance warrior, what can you do? If racism is fading fast, and people are actually embracing other cultures, clothing, music, speech patterns, etc. Your only option is to now pretend as if being in to the culture is bad. Otherwise you won't have much to complain about, and then your power structure will fade. It's like how colored people became offensive, and a few decades later, people of color is now the preferred PC term. None of it makes any sense, and it will never stop. It's just a way for some people to gain power over and control other people.

Ask yourself this. If everyone started to adhere to the PC rules of these crazy ideologues, do you think that they would calm down, stop getting angry all the time, and be kind, friendly people? Because they wouldn't. They would just make new rules. Even rules that are contradictory to the ones they've been espousing for decades. Just like cultural appropriation.

And the list could go on.

I experienced this personally the other day on this very website. I made a joke alluding to a recent under cover video of a certain democrat candidate's campaign staff.

Reddit literally automatically removes even jokes relating to this particular event that is damaging to a certain political figure you see support for on the front page here constantly.

Now, considering they do that sort of thing, are they really a platform, or are they a publisher? They are actively doing insane censorship to support a certain candidate. That is being a publisher. They are pushing a certain viewpoint, like a publisher does.

They also ban users for expressing these viewpoints. Viewpoints which are perfectly legal to express. A phone company gets this exemption because they aren't allowed to cut off your phone because of your perfectly legal political speech shared over the phone (or anywhere else). Social media companies do cut you off in the form of banning you when you express viewpoints they don't like. So they are absolutely curating like a publisher.

PoliticalHumor,feo9cpv,t1_fenv0de,1579296857.0,"Let me ask you and everyone else here another question, btw.

If Trump has really done all this illegal stuff that the media filled your heads with, then why aren't any of those things being alleged in the impeachment? Why do the articles of impeachment only consist of ""obstruction of congress"", and ""Abuse of power""? Two things that aren't even crimes. One of which isn't even a thing, and both of which are vague terms without specific legal meanings.

This is the first impeachment ever without any crime being alleged. If his crimes are innumerable, why couldn't they put even a single crime in the entire articles of impeachment? Do you think it might be because you've been mislead, and they don't actually have proof of any of those crimes? You think maybe that might be it?"

Biden and Obama did, and you're ignoring it and pretending Trump did something wrong because you hate him. Even a lot of democrats/progressives can see it, and that's why support for impeachment has completely tanked.

I have one post there that is from the other day. It has nothing to do with supporting them, why don't you actually read the post? It has to do with Reddit's censorship. They literally automatically removed my comment mentioning a certain video about a certain person's political campaign. All I did was make a joke alluding to it, I didn't even post a link. I can't mention it specifically here, or this comment may be automatically removed as well.

NintendoSwitch,fenqsfh,t1_fennjvj,1579289467.0,"I agree for the most part. Except that, in my opinion, the actual Pokemon themselves have been pretty horrendous the last few generations. And the whole ""Galar"" versions of already existing Pokemon is just really terrible. Now they have mega evolutions, and area specific evolutions. It's just a confusing mess of awfulness. That would be fine for a side game, but not for the main series.

It's a pipe dream, but what I want is a PC game where you can store all your Pokemon. They can update it with each new main game in the series so it can take the new Pokemon too. Then I'd have a reason to buy all the Pokemon games and play them, to collect all the Pokemon. You know, like the original purpose (gotta catch 'em all).

They could even re-sell their old games emulated on their consoles, with the ability to trade your Pokemon from that in to the ""central"" game. I say put it on PC because then it wouldn't die with the advent of a new console.

Anyway, that will probably never happen, and I haven't played a Pokemon game for years, so my opinion is moot. I'm still playing the old ones."

It's not wrong. Why the fuck is it wrong to try to undo the corruption of the previous president/VP? That's not wrong at all. It's right. It's very right. It's a great thing for anyone who isn't just a hardcore democrat partisan. You realize this prosecutor is a real person who had their life destroyed because they were doing the right thing, right? And now, nobody would dare investigate it again, because they know high profile American politicians will destroy them for it. Like, obviously it's a good thing that Trump is getting the leader of Ukraine to look in to it. Let's just suppose you're right and Trump is doing it for the wrong reasons. Who cares? Why would a member of the public care? The only people who would care is hardcore democrat partisans who would prefer Biden and Obama's corruption remain secret, lest it damage democrats. This is not only a good thing for Trump (which is arguable anyway, once the democrat primary is over, Biden the gaffe machine has no chance), it's more so a good thing for the public of both America and Ukraine.

It's not about nepotism though. Nepotism is bad, because more qualified candidates may lose out, but this is way worse. This is Ukraine paying for political influence with the office of the president. This is potentially a lot more corruption between democrats and Ukrainian oligarchs. Yet, you guys are focusing on Trump calling it out, rather than wanting an investigation to see what's going on there. Why is that? I think we all know why that is.

I'm on board with ousting A LOT of people in American politics, but that's not really what we're talking about here."

PoliticalHumor,feni84y,t1_fen374e,1579285247.0,"Let me just chime in as an outsider. Not even American, but been following this thing.

Joe Biden is on camera doing a quid pro quo, forcing Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son's company. A company that was paying his son 50,000 a month for no discernable reason.

Trump says on a phone call with the leader of Ukraine, ""Biden has been bragging about this, look in to it"".

Now let's not quibble about the facts, and for the sake of argument, I'll just pretend that it has been proven that Trump withheld the money to put pressure on Ukraine to do this. (it's far from proven, but let's just pretend it is)

This is not a crime, and it's not for personal gain. The only reason someone wouldn't like this is if they are a hardcore democrat partisan. Joe Biden is obviously corrupt. He used the office of the president (he said that Obama backed him, on video, which I will link below) to get a prosecutor who was investigating very shady things around his son fired.

Trump getting the Ukraine leader to look in to this is a good thing for anyone who doesn't like corruption. This could only be bad if you don't care about Democrat corruption. Is Biden now immune because he's running for president? Who's going to do something about it? Are Americans supposed to just wait until the next presidency and hope whoever gets in to office does something about it? Why would they ever do that, it's implied by Biden in the video that Obama backed him pressuring Ukraine to fire the prosecutor. Biden says ""Call him"". So clearly democrats are not going to do anything about this. It would be horrible for them politically.

And here's a quick summary of how absurd the whole situation is. Joe Biden uses the office of the president to pressure Ukraine in to firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company his son works at and gets paid ridiculous amounts of money from. Trump asks the leader of Ukraine to look in to it. And you guys are saying ""Trump is a criminal, look at what he did here, getting the leader of Ukraine to look in to a case of obvious corruption. And BTW, elect the guy responsible for the corruption, Joe Biden"". It's honestly just kind of funny at this point. How can you guys expect anyone to take you seriously?

[Here is a link to Joe Biden bragging about using the office of the president and his power as VP to get a prosecutor fired. A prosecutor who was looking in to Burisma, a Ukranian gas company that his son sits on the board of, despite having no expertise or even knowing the language, and gets paid 50k per month for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBGKEfcj76Q)

Look at that video. Joe Biden withholds a billion dollars, with Obama's permission, so they can get a prosecutor who was investigating his son's company fired. Trump allegedly withholds a billion dollars to get the leader of Ukraine to look in to this corruption. You want to elect the guy who got the prosecutor fired, and are saying the guy who wants it investigated is a criminal. Like... what? Who is buying this? Even most of the progressives I listen to think it's ridiculous. Impeachment support is down among democrats even, let alone progressives."
