politics,fffwqks,t1_ffcqam9,1579893480.0,I will ask him. I'm genuinely curious what they think.
politics,ffflxrc,t1_fffbrvd,1579886807.0,"Are you being deliberately oversimplistic, or do you just not understand how things work?

The gov't is a monopoly? So, like, you want competing DMVs, or competing regulatory agencies like the EPA? Does the Bloomberg EPA want to regulate your disposal of cancer-causing waste? Try the DeSantis EPA! They charge more for a license to discharge your cancer into the environment, but they guarantee you will never be inspected!

And there is oversight in government. There are Inspector Generals, there are elected legislative bodies at the county, state and federal levels. There are newspapers. There are fucking voters. They all have oversight powers. Can you FOIA Dow Chemical's internal e-mails? No. Can you FOIA the EPA's? Yeah, you can.

Education is a great example, so glad you brought it up. Here's a system that is funded by local taxes so people actively work to put as little into it as possible (FL, AL, MS and NV excel at this). They require expensive graduate degrees of their employees but then don't really want to pay much (see previous point). Their customer is other people's children, so that's plenty complicated. And public schools are required to take all children in their district, no matter the disability, their emotional state, their cognitive ability. BTW, these kids all have to pass a standardized test or the school will be labeled as failing. 

The answer is competition from charter schools! So take money from the public schools you're already complaining about and give it to charter schools who have almost no accountability, can pick and choose which students they will take, and in the end, have not shown to improve outcomes for students anyway. 

There's lots we can improve about government. A big part of that will be getting rid of the dark money in politics, which Sanders, Warren and AOC are talking about. But talk about running gov't like a business is outright BS."

politics,ffcc1iv,t1_ffca5pi,1579796199.0,"I hear you, and I do think that if you denounce libertarianism for what it is, you should not be persecuted for having once believed it. You (universal you) have to denounce libertarianism in all its forms (not just for healthcare for example) because it's equally flawed in every real-world situation. 

It would also be helpful for ex-Libertarians to talk to the nerdy white kids who believe this BS and show them how it doesn't actually work.

FYI, I work with a libertarian, and he's a true believer. Like, he attends party meetings and such. I like him personally, and he makes some attempt at not being a compleat moron about libertarianism so I give him some credit for that. Last year I asked him what the party platform is for climate change. I was curious how a libertarian party would address it. He stammered and finally admitted that they mostly don't believe in it, ergo there's nothing to ""fix"". I was pretty disappointed. They know they can't address climate change and keep their libertarian street cred, so they pretend it doesn't exist. Just fuck right off with that shit."

For most people, I think they know what the right decision is, they just won't want to accept it. It's hard, it's SUPER HARD, but allowing them to go so they don't suffer is the ultimate caring act you can do. And that's why they have trusted you all these years. Because they know you will do the best for them that you can. 

Let that be your lodestar, and fall apart after they're gone. This is what I had to do for my darling calico. I was calm and soothing while the vet did his thing, and after he left, then I fell apart. But it was the right thing, and she didn't suffer a minute more than she had to.

politics,fe95xc0,t1_fe8nejw,1578934615.0,"The other unwritten point here is that whether or not you agree that Democrats are passing ""quality of life"" bills for health care or minimum wage as they should, the Republican side doesn't even support those ideas in theory! So yes, Speaker Pelosi may not have pushed for the exact minimum wage bill you wanted and that can be a little disappointing as a voter BUT FOR FUCKS SAKE Republicans would still have you working for $4.25/hour if they could. I don't trust these voters who say shit like ""Why haven't the Democrats raised the minimum wage? I mean, I know the GOP won't let it get through the Senate and the President won't sign it, but the Democrats should be doing something, right?"" And the commentariat jerk each other off and say, ""The Democrats are missing an opportunity here if they don't pass something soon!""

It feels like ""economic anxiety"" all over again. GOPers who are happy with the racism and nationalism but would vote Democratic if they were offered some specific financial benefit, even though they'd never even ask for anything like that from their own side.

politics,fe85rw7,t1_fe7xptv,1578922886.0,"You really learn how arbitrary the stock market is once you start working for a publicly traded company.

As an example, here are some real-world examples of my company's stock price movement after its quarterly report (FYI-The company has had maybe two actual money-losing Q's in the last 10 years):

Miss expectations: Stock goes down.

Meet expectations, forecast for next Q is bad: Stock goes down.

Miss expectations, forecast for next Q is good: Stock goes down.

Exceed expectations, forecast for next Q is bad: Stock goes down.

Exceed expectations, but not by as much as the Street expected, forecast for next Q is good: Stock goes down.

Exceed expectations by more than the forecast from last Q: Stock goes down.

Random Tuesday: Stock goes up $2.37.

And as a backdrop to this, companies like the one that makes Candy Crush are valued at 3-5 times my company AND WE HAVE REAL FUCKING ASSETS AND A STRING OF PROFITABLE QUARTERS! At one point Uber was worth like 7 times as much and they had never had a profitable quarter ever!

politics,fdgmc2l,t1_fdeppz3,1578402126.0,"Thanks for your response. From your description, it sounds like your church has a quality pastor that truly understands the Bible. While I may not agree with him, I respect that.

I asked because I have seen many posts from congregants who have said they feared speaking up because their fellow members were actively hostile to anyone in opposition, or DID speak up and were attacked and ridiculed until they finally left the church. 

Reddit paints with a broad brush, esp. when it comes to religion, and that's not fair. But I do think a number of Christian communities are maintaining their ""unity"" by forcing anyone who disagrees to keep quiet. This makes them seem more homogenous than they are. We need people like you to stand up and say, ""Hey I have the same values you do, and there is no way we can support putting kids in cages."" This change has to come from within, and any Christian who won't speak up against this hate is helping to perpetuate it. Jesus spoke out against injustice--Christians ought to follow his example."
