I think it's admirable that people that either did not want to go to college or could not go to college now have an interest and the means to learn. That's a GOOD thing for our country. (not to knock trade schools, they're great, too.)

Have you ever asked them about their experience in the military to get a different perspective about what he might have gone through? 

Also, if people were so concerned about student loans there are sacrifices they could have made to mitigate the cost of college. They could have done community college and then finished at a four-year. They could have chosen a less expensive school in-state. They could be better with money management and sacrifice things like Netflix, expensive cell phones and electronics, and extensive weekends out at the bar. They could have worked more than one job. (I know bartenders that make enough to cover tuition in one summer). They could have joined the military.

I’m not saying that you aren't a hard-working individual that hasn’t sacrificed things. 

I’m saying that young adults demanding free college and complete student loan forgiveness across the board isn't a good solution because a free education is available to everyone if they want it bad enough... it's just that most people don't want to work and sacrifice for it, myself included. 

Granted, half of my education was paid for in athletic scholarship. But I still have 70K in loans. And I am okay with paying my loans back because that's the agreement I signed and I didn't additionally sacrifice anything to mitigate my cost of college.

Why don't we start questioning why higher education costs so much in the first place? There's no reason why prices should be inflated over 60% in under half a century except for the fact that the government got involved."
TrueOffMyChest,ffe9v3k,t1_ffe8sar,1579840723.0,Lmao I just remember casually dating a young soldier who ended up getting his orders to move across the country within six months of us meeting. He suggested that I quit school and give up my athletic scholarship and marry him and I was like ”BRO YOU ARE CRAZY I DONT EVEN KNOW YOUR MIDDLE NAME” but I didn't understand the culture as a 20/21 year old college girl and 5 years later I STILL think it's weird lol
TrueOffMyChest,ffe9kc3,t3_estgtz,1579840466.0,"The first job that I (25F) had when I graduated college sounded like a really fun opportunity that ended up giving me severe depression and health issues.

Our organization was small, we had four employees. I was 22 at the time and everyone else was 25-30 and married or married with kids.

I unknowingly was hired to be a workhorse and work 15-17 hour days consistently. I worked in the office from 9 to 5, and then had to be out at events from 6 to sometimes 2am because of the nature and location of my job. 

About 9 months in on this I decided to fly home for a three-day weekend when we had nothing on our books to see my family and decompress. I had stopped working out, obviously was drinking a lot and eating out a lot, and gained 60 pounds in that 9 month period, and was just really angry and sad all the time. I didn’t tell anyone I left, because there was nothing on our books and I had the weekend off.

My bosses found out that I had left and called me into the office on Tuesday morning. They were pissed that I had left town when I was on-call. I told them that I didn’t know I was still on-call when we had literally nothing going on. They said that I was always expected to be on-call because I was single and had no other obligations.

I told them that I was really unhappy with that response and wanted to negotiate job responsibilities because there was no reason that I should be pulling 110 hour weeks for what I was being paid.

They said that they were not going to renew my contract at the end of the season instead.

I told them that I would finish out the remainder of my events and resigned in that meeting. I lasted 10 months at that company.

My current work situation is fucking crazy but it's better than that. I'm still working 80- 110 hour weeks but part of that is being a full time graduate student that is attached to my job.


Just thinking back on that first experience in the real world pisses me off. Seriously, how are single professionals supposed to meet people and eventually not be single anymore if work culture doesn't support that?"

You're welcome :)"
rapecounseling,ff1mubk,t3_er1xgy,1579481792.0,"I went through this, too, as a coping mechanism. It was an important step, in my opinion, of learning how to touch and be touched by another human again. 

I will say that I put myself in situations with men who did not care about me, and eventually got tired of allowing myself to be treated less than I deserve. I was looking for love and care in literally all the wrong places. So I stopped and I haven't dated, touched, or had sex with another man in over 2.5 years. And I've made lots of progress in therapy on learning to love who I am.

As for your self-talk/self-identification of being a ”slut”...

I've thought about this..a lot..after being shamed from one of my close friends for my behavior after I was raped. She didn't know what happened at the time, I only just told her a month ago (five years after it happened), and I think it's absolute bullshit that in 2020 we are still shaming people for living their lives the way they want to.

Life is so short. Take advantage of all the experiences it has to offer while you can. I think that's why people ultimately judge others. Because they're *scared* to live.

So, forget the labels that society puts on people as an attempt to describe who they are. Forget ”whore”, ”slut”, ”victim”.

You make your own story. You get to control your own narrative. Go live your life.

As long as your encounters have been healthy and consensual, and if sex is helping you cope with where you're at right now on your journey, that's nobody’s business but your own. And what you're going through is not uncommon.

I know it's hard, but remember to love yourself."

1) Prioritize your health. Set aside an hour or two to move your body. Meal prep and eat healthy. Keep alcoholic drinks to a minimum. Make sure you get between 5-6 hours of sleep per night.

2) Stay organized AF. Make a plan for each day and execute it. Lean on team members that are allies at work when you need to escape for a break. I find that bullet journaling helps me organize my life the best.

3) Surround yourself with people who love you, support you, and understand your grind. They’ll be more than happy to help you when you're stressed and need a laugh. I currently try and do one fun weekend a month with my friends, because that's pretty much all I can do.

4) Once you get home, no more work communication, especially at night. If you're constantly available for work, people will take advantage of you. You can work from home, but don’t let anyone talk to you about it. It can wait until you get to work next. Work phone goes on the kitchen counter. Check it before you go to bed for emergencies. That's it.

IsItBullshit,fdfho0c,t1_fdefypg,1578361925.0,"So here is my story about my experience with the CLEP test that doubles as a cautionary tale to all undergraduate students.

I graduated from a small lib arts college on a softball scholarship. I was a business major, and because I transferred in, I had to take an extra semester. The last semester, my super senior semester,  I had my final two business classes left to take as well Biology for Non-Science majors.

I was really busy with my business classes and starting the job hunt. Also, everyone told me that Bio for Non-Science majors was a breeze....The professor would pass you if you were a senior as long as you showed up... blah, blah, blah.

I thought that I was getting a C- all semester long. I had a decent relationship with my professor, a new guy, with the exception that I didn’t go to class as much as he would have liked me to. 

Well, the weekend before finals my body started going into the beginning stages of Protein Toxicity Syndrome, and I got sick. I had to go to the hospital and they found 24 kidney stones and had to treat me. I missed my finals.

Luckily, I was diligent in my other classes that I was able to get all my final papers done prior to finals week, and I didn’t have tests. However, because of that C- I needed to take my final.

I called my professor and talked to him. It turns out, he didn’t know who I was and had been looking at another student’s grades all semester long. I actually had a D in the class. I took the test while I was in the hospital, and ended up failing the course. It was a Thursday when they told me that.

The registrar told me to lobby for an appeal with my professor. He said because he was new he couldn’t make an exception for me because he was trying to make tenure. The registrar told me that my only last option was to take the CLEP test. I had until Monday to take it and submit my results to the registrar’s office to graduate. Mind you, this was all done in a 3-day period while I was in the hospital.

I ended up getting released from the hospital and they gave me pain meds because while they had blasted the kidney stones, not all of them had passed. I didn't take them though, because I don't like medicine. I went to the public library for the county and rented the CLEP test prep book for the natural sciences, and taught myself biology, geology, organic chemistry, and physics and ended up passing. The test gave me 12 science credits, which was enough for a minor in science in addition to the other course that I had already taken the year prior.

The test was $125 and while my experience was extreme, I advocate that students know about this option. Especially students that are non-traditional and working full-time, and military personnel that want their degrees.

...or you can learn from me and just do your work and go to class even though you hate it and not have to take the CLEP to graduate lol"
