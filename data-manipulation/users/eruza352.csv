travel,ffils78,t1_ffil2cq,1579976929.0,"It would look better if the pic had filters and what not but I guess it's better for me this way. The water is not dirty, it's green because of the algae and the speed (it's not a fast river due to the bends). And thanks!"

travel,ffi0tp5,t1_ffhzopc,1579961635.0,"You can reach this viewpoint from the river itself, take a boat which leaves you at the beginning of the trail, it's very steep and you need to go upwards for about 2h (more if you're inexperienced, but kids were in the same grouo as me and it took them about 2.5h). At the top there a small store (coffee, juices, food...) and this viewpoint. Then you have to go back to the beginning of the trail (much more difficult going down than up imo) and get into the boat which takes you back to land. Ofc you can get there by land too but the woods are dangerous and as far as I know there are no tours through the woods. As for online you can just google ""Uvac hike"", a lot of things come up. Hope this helps :)"
