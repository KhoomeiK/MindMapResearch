oddlysatisfying,ffnx2za,t1_ffm8p2t,1580071859.0,"Collisions are fairly rare as long as you know the fundamentals.

You basically have a set of charts saying ""March from A to B with this step size at this tempo"" and you just do that. Practice each move several times. Bam.

Especially since they aren't really marching, they have no instruments, and they aren't playing music this isn't too bad. A bit tight though not insanely so.

The thing that really makes it easy is that they're all in boxes and straight lines. The easiest moves in marching. Curves are the hard parts of marching.

The only collisions in my 5 years marching were people not getting out of the way of the band. Usually cocky football players trying to dick around but not getting out of the way. That said, they usually topple easy since they don't expect you to walk through them.

Oh, and one time a trombone player was doing a passthrough and the spitvalve snagged someone's plume. They weren't wearing their hat fastened tight and it came right off and stayed stuck to the end of the trombone as he marched away. Fortunately it was during a rehearsal."

China is largely crowded and unhygenic.

That isn't racist.

That's objective.

It is incredibly densely packed. Many of the social norms of most Western societies that relate to sanitary conditions and generally cautiousness of potential vectors of disease just don't exist or are radically different. Traditional medicines still have massive influence. There's a strong sector of people that distrust western medicine. There's still a significant gap in the ease and likelyhood of access to proper medical care due to the economics of the country.

It has nothing at all to do with race. It's a difference in culture that has ill side-effects."

The wiki at least mentions how bullet *fragments* partially caused his issues so I guess he didn't totally stop it before it hit the brain. Just a last-second type of thing.

There is mention of his frontal cortex etc being damaged they never elaborate much on, but the end result is that without his diode that basically regulates him and offloads some of the work, he almost totally loses speech and fine motor control, not to mention his ability, and regardless of that they can't totally make up for the damage so he is basically half-strength even using all he's got.

AskReddit,ffiesoy,t1_ffi3bcy,1579972151.0,"Honestly, part of why I've ended up loving an anime series recently is when I started thinking about what happens when people get hurt.

Barring concussive forces being a thing, it's always either semi-understandable or explained away. Characters end up either in the hospital or performing some kind of medical care basically every time they fight. While they cheat to keep people alive and speed things up, they never get away free.

One character gets shot in the head. He stops the bullet using (power) basically right before it actually hits his brain, but is still left crippled from the shot for the rest of his life and needs special equipment to speak, stand, etc.. He spends months in the hospital with Doctor Jesus.

Woman gets shot in the a major artery. Down almost instantly. Only survives because previous guy used (power) to basically make an instant artificial replacement, but she's still stuck in the hospital with Doctor Jesus for a month and by the end of that still can barely walk.

Etc.

I never would have thought I'd appreciate this care so much. It's basic but goes a long way towards adding to the show."

AskReddit,ffgjsta,t1_ffg3bmo,1579907863.0,"The way young boys are regarded compared to young girls is revolting.

Recently I've been around my nephew often and he's treated like some beast that needs to be whipped into shape at every opportunity, meanwhile his sisters next to him could do a crazy amount of shit and barely come close.

Any time something isn't right, especially if it has nothing to do with him, he gets yelled at and punished disproportionately. ""Wrong tone"" (when he's talking like normal), ""give ___ to your sister and stop hogging it"" (when he just got his turn after waiting for 30 minutes), etc.. It's like if his caregiver at the moment is a woman he's instantly assumed to be doing something wrong. And he'll, of course, be distraught and ask what he can do to be better, to which he's just yelled at with ""you know!"" ""...but I don't"" ""you know! Stop back-talking!""

When it's a male, like me, my dad, or the single male teacher I've seen him around, he has virtually no issues whatsoever. He may mess up or make mistakes, but he will correct it as soon as he can and already clearly feels bad if he does.

But then you get how he's talked about by people like my dad.

He asks if he can have a bit of colour in his hair because he thinks it looks awesome, which is girly and a bad sign. He wears __boot_brand__ because they're all he has, handmedowns from his older sister, which is a bad sign. His cousin (who has massive issues) breaks his tablet he tried to hide under his bed in a room he isn't allowed in, so he's not taking care of his stuff.

And don't even get me started on what they say about him.... liking to watch Fortnight and Minecraft videos on YouTube.

One time he got a cartridge stuck backwards in my Switch when he wasn't supposed to be changing games. He came to me, told me, and apologized. My mom yelled at him for breaking it and made him go outside to ""think about what he did"" and banned him from using his bike while out there. I *finally* convince them to let me handle it. I fix it, go outside, and explain to him what he did wrong. Boy was hiding behind a tree. He hasn't had another issue like that since.

And I know I'm harping on situations with my family for easy to explain examples, but it holds true when I've seen him anywhere, even at his school or at the park, and the same goes for many other young boys.

They're guilty until.

But otherwise I agree with you. While the new autopilot type features and building SUVs that make you feel invincible is cool and all, and by all rights there should be the choice, it's a phenomenon like removing traffic lights and putting in roundabouts. Yes, you're putting more on the driver, and the average driver is a terrible driver. But you're also forcing them to pay attention and be aware.

Naturally I don't have the resources for such a macro-level decades-long study, but I wouldn't be surprised if, adjusting for numbers, accidents have actually been getting much more likely as we've moved towards bigger, more assisting cars and more dictating traffic systems with less visibility."

I got a BEUD on my first pull from the box and took it into ranked just for the hell of it. That was the shit. Dinos and Umi decks being competitive with random Weeviles thrown in? Awesome.

I still never got a single Sphere Kuriboh until I started to play again recently, same with Wall of Disruption. Without that, never had a shot at KoG. Only one ECon too. Now the name of the game for me is trying to get Snipe Hunter. Last big card I need, I think.

I got back into Duel Links again just because I realized I could reuse a lot of my old cards in a decent-ish Blue Eyes deck, with the smaller card count and all slowing it down. It's at least manageable with me in low gold.

But when I have those games where it's turn 3 and I'm already 7 cards behind reading their effects while they're spamming out shit, I just surrender. I prefer having fun over winning a text adventure speedrun."

WatchPeopleDieInside,ff6jmno,t1_ff6gkbu,1579628607.0,"Larger engine and vehicle, especially for a manual, is the best way to learn.

Not only is it safer if there's an accident, but they are inherently more lethargic and encourage the new driver to be more proactive than reactive. 

The body of the truck also provides supreme visibility compared to many smaller vehicles, both helping the driver be more aware of his/her surroundings and being less stressful as they don't have much in the way of blindspots.

Finally, the large engine and especially size represent the top end of what they are likely to be using in their lifetime, so if they are able to train themselves to manage those beasts well that directly translates to almost any other vehicle with the added bonus of maybe keeping them a bit more spaced out from other cars as they were used to the larger size and somewhat maintain that spacing to a lesser extent."

She always comes to side with whoever my dad sides with *totally* of her own deliberation.

Then, as opposed to my dad who is fine with disagreement and never supports anyone unconditionally, my mom will take any perceived slight against the candidate/position as a personal slight which can only be conducted either out of ignorance or malice.

And, magically, if ever my dad adjusts his position she happens to instantly have arrived at the same conclusion, which is of course the one she has always had.

Yu-Gi-Oh is my go-to example for this sort of thing. My Duel Links deck is shit by meta standards, but that's because I just could not be bothered to learn what the fuck the best cards mean since they all have five paragraphs of text. Instead I just play my own Blue Eyes deck. Mostly just a straight-up strategy that's very direct in what it wants to do with a few bits of spice.
