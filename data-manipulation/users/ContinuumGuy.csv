Because in general the fanservice was in service (heh) to the greater story. Like, yeah, they go back trough a ""greatest hits of the MCU"" (and also *Dark World*), but it's clearly as part of a greater plot (getting the stones) and also serves as a way to show how the heroes have changed from earlier in the timeline.

By contrast, most of the fanservice in *Rise of Skywalker* was kind of random. Lando is there!.... on a random planet for some reason. Wedge Antilles is back!... for four seconds. The remnants of the second Death Star are important because.... reasons. Palpatine is back because.... Ian McDiarmid still has scenery left to chew?"

Like, look at superheroes. Most Batman fans would list Kevin Conroy (the voice of Batman in the DCAU, the Arkham video games, and a few other projects) as either their favorite Batman or close to it, and would have similar feelings about Mark Hamill's Joker.... but many times when a site does ""Every Batman Ranked"" or ""Every Joker Ranked"" they won't even include them. 

Connected to that, Hollywood types tear their hair out over how Superman just isn't relatable and DC just doesn't lend itself to MCU-style connected storytelling while ignoring the fact that *DC fucking did it perfectly in cartoon form back in the 90s and early 2000s*.

DaystromInstitute,ff79wrv,t3_es0smx,1579644170.0,"Bit of a tangent here, but... This got me to thinking of how this is sort of the opposite of a point made in recent *X-Men* comics that have sort of driven a contrast between natural evolution and transhumanism. 

The X-Men and other mutants are ""natural"" transhumans, meant to be the next step of evolution. And yet, they are feared in-universe by most of the world.

However, the Marvel Universe at large is *full* of characters that would be considered transhumanistic in nature in a harder Science Fiction context. Captain America, the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Hulk, etc. have all gotten powers (mostly involuntarily, although there are exceptions like Cap) beyond the ordinary man through unnatural methods (radiation, steroids, etc.). Iron Man and his ilk have essentially become transhuman through technology. Yet they are beloved by the populace (except for Spider-Man because ***HE'S A MENACE I TELL YOU!!***).

It feels like the opposite is true in Star Trek. If a human in Star Trek suddenly just naturally got psionic powers (which is implied by the fact that Gary Mitchell and Elizabeth Dehner had ""esper ratings"" even BEFORE they got turbo-charged and driven mad by the galactic barrier) because of a regular mutation, it'd probably be nothing (so long as they didn't go mad). But if it turned out that they got those psionic abilities because of genetic augmentation then HOLY SHIT THEY MIGHT BE THE NEXT KHAN (unless they're Bashir).  

Two long-running franchises that have been worked over by countless hands over the decades, and yet they basically drew two entirely different approaches to how the public-at-large would interpret transhumanism. An interesting contrast."
