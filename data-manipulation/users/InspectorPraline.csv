Internet communities were a decade or so ahead of the changes in mainstream advice (though obviously this was based on studies, not guess work)

For me personally I don’t find doctors useful unless the problem is obvious. Like I randomly developed dermatitis on my face last year and I was being yo-yo’d between the doctor who would only tell me to use cortisol cream on it, and the pharmacist who refused as it would be too damaging to the skin to use it. In the end I solved it myself by doing a few days of fasting every few months (based on me assuming it was an autoimmune issue, and reading that fasting can help reset your immune system). No doctor would have suggested it, but it worked

William I of England (William the Conqueror) – Henry I – Empress Matilda – Henry II – King John – Henry III – Edward I – Edward II – Edward III – John of Gaunt – John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset – John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset – Lady Margaret Beaufort – Henry VII – Margaret Queen of Scots – James V of Scotland – Mary, Queen of Scots – James the VI of Scotland and I of England – Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia – Sophia of Hanover – George I of Great Britain – George II – Frederick, Prince of Wales – George III – Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn – Queen Victoria – Edward VII – George V – George VI – Elizabeth II.
