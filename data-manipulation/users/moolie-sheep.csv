AnimalsBeingJerks,ff3epc8,t1_ff37t21,1579539554.0,I have two litter trained rabbits who were spayed and they are the best pets i have ever had. They are so loving and energetic. I understand if you do not like them but please don't judge a whole species on a few misbehaved bunnies. If it wasn't for their tender love and care i would probably not still be here. Edit:spelling

extremelyinfuriating,feu0eui,t1_fety9w4,1579381880.0,I agree i have always used public transport which helped my confidence too. My mum was amazing at helping me to do new things and if it wasn't for her encouragement i would be lonely and terrified of going out. The article really is awful and treats teens like selfish brats who should keep to themselves and stop being burdens. It is clinical and black and white i agree.
