dogs,fdi78jp,t1_fdha8t6,1578436971.0,"It is not the first time these children have had this dog out, the last time it tried to charge my dog but there were two other children with them and they were able to control it. And by control it I mean stop its advance when it was about halfway across the road to us and two of the kids laying down holding the leash. A body cam is not a bad idea, especially considering had i had an aresol deterrent yesterday the kids running after the dog would likely have caught some of it and that could have caused me some issues."
dogs,fdi6mfk,t1_fdhaoem,1578436664.0,Thanks for this. It is hard to know what is the best route.
dogs,fdi6dp4,t1_fdhc3m4,1578436534.0,"I didn't know there was a dog version. Thanks for the tip. It has also been added to my cart so I can do some research. One brand is citronella, I had never heard of it being a dog repellant."
dogs,fdi5w0r,t1_fdhbdcq,1578436283.0,"There are two dogs in my neighborhood who are never on leash but the the owner has impeccable voice command of them It is amazing really. Other then that house that I know I can pass even if the dogs are out though we have had so many bad interactions with unrestrained dogs I am to the point of having to carry weapons to protect my animals, its terrible."
dogs,fdi5bpe,t1_fdhca9c,1578435999.0,Thanks for the tips. Small claims are $25 here and that fee is usually refunded in the award if the court finds in your favor.
dogs,fdi52ho,t1_fdhcmgk,1578435867.0,"There really is not two sides to see here. There are no children in that age group who could control a full grown dog of this breed/size. Furthermore children are unlikely to be experienced in what to do if their dog breaks free, starts to attack a person or animal, or starts reacting negatively to its environment while on lead.
They never should have had that dog out of the house that day without competent adult supervision."
dogs,fdi3ya1,t1_fdhe082,1578435306.0,That breaks my heart I love greyhounds so much. When I called I expected the dog to be at the least impounded until they could prove it was up to date on shots and had a license and paid some fines. I was pretty disappointed in the whole process.
dogs,fdi3jfq,t1_fdhdmb4,1578435098.0,"Only allow people with a well known ability to control your dog to walk it without your supervision  Invest in good quality leashes harness'  and/or collars. If your dog is reactive on a leash muzzle it, muzzles protect your animal too because most people will give a muzzled animal a wide berth,  if you don't want to muzzle walk in unpopulated areas or at times when other people are not likely to be out.  If your dog injures someone their dog or damages someones property, you should be the one reaching out offering to pay."
dogs,fdi29lt,t1_fdhe0ah,1578434446.0,I will check them out. Not sold on the mace/bear repellant yet or a taser. Trying to balance safety/effacy/convienence and find the best option I am comfortable with. Thanks for the suggestion.

dogs,fdi10d7,t1_fdhwtio,1578433817.0,"I am so sorry that happened to you, and having to rehome after something like that must have been so hard. Someone stopped and helped me yesterday too she helped get the kids and the dog moving along once I got them seperated. So far they have still been best buds today, snuggling on the couch and wanting to play and wrestle. I am keeping my fingers crossed that their relationship doesn't change. Thank you for your kind wishes!"

dogs,fdgeus6,t1_fdg2qdu,1578393508.0,"Thanks for your well wishes! It doesn't change my mind about the breed, I have met sweet and gentle pits. It does however re-enforce my opinion that we need some regulation of breeding and ownership of these animals to keep them out of the hands of shit owners as much as we can. They are not more aggressive then other breeds, however their bites are so much more devistating, they should only be allowed in the hands of experienced and responsible owners."

dogs,fdge9v0,t1_fdfy4tl,1578392685.0,"Thank you. Animal control has been contacted. Unfortunately we will have to take them to court to try to collect damages though so far monetary damages are minimal.
I am honestly not sure, I was trying desperately to hold three dogs with two hands, so I couldn't really keep tabs on that."

My dogs are normally fine on a leash and only reactive when uncontrolled dogs are running twords them. I also suspect this will only be a learning experience for me, going to look into some bear repellant tomorrow."
dogs,fdfvrz8,t1_fdft6a4,1578371530.0,Thank you for your kind and thoughtful response. I will keep these things in mind while deciding how to move forward from here.
dogs,fdfvhzc,t1_fdft2ir,1578371314.0,"If you had actually read my post you would see that animal control has already said the best they can do is a written warning. While I appreciate your conjecture that my dogs were not ""fully attacked"" because they are not dead you have overstepped and are incorrect. Also trying to guilt me about what the authorities may decide is the most appropriate handling of this animal is a really disgusting thing to do."

dogs,fdft3vx,t1_fdfriac,1578369531.0,"Where I live this type of claim will be handled in small claims court and attorneys are not required. The law here considers pets property so it is the same as if they broke my kitchen table. I will be made financially whole by the courts and luckily for them, I have the best vet in the world and so far the grand total is at $76 usd. Hopefully it stays there because that means they recovered without any complications."
dogs,fdfrpgf,t1_fdfqpvo,1578368567.0,"Their car was not in the driveway when we left for the vet, which is why I assumed they were not home at that time immediately following the attack. It was however there when we got back. It has been four hours since we reported the attack to athorities, they were supposed to get back to us and have not. It is now after hours here and the phone goes to an answering service that only deals with emegencies. It is not crazy to call the police, but they will not come, they do not deal with animal issues and will refer us to the phone number that is being answered by the service only dealing with emergencies. To say that this incident has shown a huge light on the inadequacies of our local animal control, their powers and operations would be a massive understatement.
Editing to add, that those inadequacies are fueled 100% by inadequate funding and poor outdated ordinences and not the fault of animal control officers who do the best they can with what they have while doing what I am sure is sometimes a very unpleasant job."

I am going to wait to file until they are completely healed up and I know for sure the total costs though.

dogs,fdfocx3,t1_fdfmx7g,1578366345.0,"Looked like not home, but I'm not sure. Animal control was supposed to contact them and call back, it has been 4 hours and we have not heard anything."
dogs,fdfo4rn,t1_fdfmnlj,1578366197.0,"Thanks for the support! I am currently nursing leash burns on my arm from the day after Christmas when a different neighbor opened his front door and let out his two boxers with no leashes, my back was turned as I was picking up poop, which made my dogs extra protective. It is all the time with the unleashed dogs. It doesn't help that due to budget issues our animal control will only come out for sick or injured animals, not for loose dog complaints. I just want to walk my dogs it shouldnt be this hard!"
dogs,fdfncm0,t1_fdflwxh,1578365684.0,Thank you for the support! My husband has enough irate for both of us currently so I get to be level headed. Extra scritches and treats were very thankfully welcomed on your behalf.
dogs,fdfn4g2,t1_fdfm9ov,1578365534.0,Thanks for your response. It does feel better knowing others have went through similar things and it all turned out ok. I ended up grabbing it by its ears twisted and pulled till it released. My vet said that was not the best thing to do and I'm lucky I wasn't bit.

dogs,fcsiswe,t1_fcruzrd,1577917312.0,Our most recent adoption was in April and I had been cruising online profiles for months before a dog caught my eye enough to go down to the humane society and meet. Something about her picture spoke to me and i couldnt stop thinking about her. We adopted her that day. when you know you know. Good luck in your search!
dogs,fckkjkn,t3_ehoolb,1577727336.0,"Go to your local shelter and meet some dogs. You don't have to adopt immediately and you will know when you meet the dog with the right personality and energy level for you. Do some research on breeds that interest you, there are some breeds that it is nearly impossible for the average person to meet their mental and physical exercise demands, and that can lead to behavioral issues. 
I am going to take a stab in the dark based on your brief comments and say look into a retired racing greyhound. Sweet, gentle, lazy, but a lot of personality."
