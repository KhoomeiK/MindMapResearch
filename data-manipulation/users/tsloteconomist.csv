Here is the earliest comment about the price of Bitcoin from when it was still a technical novelty:

> As an amusing thought experiment, imagine that Bitcoin is successful and becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world.  Then the total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With 20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million. 

> So the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute
time may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million
to 1! Even if the odds of Bitcoin succeeding to this degree are slim,
are they really 100 million to one against? Something to think about...

Again predicting the future is uncertain and risk and return are on a spectrum and everything is priced by the market. The market doesn’t care about intrinsic value or fundamentals, just return rates regardless of where it comes from. Low risk tends to approach the common denominator of government bond rates. If there was a truly 0 risk company beating that return in dividends, it would get bought up until its share price was in line with market risk-adjusted returns. 

In either case, speculation or fundamental investing, you only beat the market by outperforming its predictions. Some people feel like their edge over the market is in predicting business performance so they focus on fundamentals. Some people think their prediction edge is forecasting human behaviour so they focus on speculation or day trading. Some people think they have no edge, so they buy index funds or government bonds."
