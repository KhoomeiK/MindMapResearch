gaming,ffizw31,t1_ffiz52m,1579986856.0,He was the one that really brought the trouble into the light.  He really did it all to himself.  Could have just listened to criticism and sort his games out.  Not sue steam. Thanks to u/Valoneria for reminding me!
gaming,ffizhj8,t1_ffieb95,1579986562.0,"At the time it was all about asset flips and stolen artwork, and lots of people were doing it, but they really rinsed the shit out of steam.  These people and A LOT of others were the reason card drops and keys become restricted, flooding the store with shovelware because asset packs are cheap and in a good few cases full game asset packs being uploaded as if the uploader had created this game from scratch.

There's nothing wrong with using assets (who has the time to create this stuff) but these guys just didn't give a fuck. I released a game (or was making one - it's been a while) on steam around when the digital homicide / Jim sterling debacle was happening, and all the literal asset flips were overcrowding the store and (at least i feel) devaluing other people's work.

It's been about a year since I was seriously on steam and havnt done dev work in about the same time, but I really hope valve have sorted their shit out and have a decent store front."
gaming,ffi0chy,t1_ffhz7ad,1579961178.0,Pretty much.  That arsehole is one of the reasons steam turned to utter shite.

SegaSaturn,feaw4sk,t3_eoa360,1578952787.0,"I ended up modding my pal saturn with a 50/60hz switch so I could play imports with the ar cart.  Some ntsc imports won't run right on 50hz.

Plus the cart slot is terrible, so there's that as well.

Edit: I got msh vs sf, xmen vs sf and vampire saviour imports not too long ago.  Vampire was grand and xmen was playable, but msh was corrupting from the get go.  Now when the cart is in PROPERLY and at 60hz, it works fine.  But again, the cart slots are terrible."
