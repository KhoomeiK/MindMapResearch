savedyouaclick,fehf3na,t1_fehdbam,1579115236.0,"Politics is about policy, not personality. If you don't like Warren/Biden/Steyer that's fine. Most people probably have some issue with them. But if you are voting for a Democrat it's because your ideologies and political beliefs are very different from Donald Trump's. At the end of the day, a Warren presidency and a Sanders presidency would be very similar. But a Trump second term will simply continue all of the policies you detest. Policies that will affect you too. This is why Republicans have done so well lately. Their base will rally behind their candidate despite the issues they might have. GOP voters vote as a bloc, while Dems fight amongst each other and inevitably lose.

The British Empire had a strategy called ""divide and rule."" Set their subjects against each other by causing internal strife, and rule over them while they're busy fighting each other. This is what the Russian state is doing to the West today. They want us to fight amongst ourselves while they slowly dismantle our institutions piece by piece. Don't unwittingly become a pawn in this! Vote for Sanders if that's your guy, who knows, there's a high chance he'll be nominated. But don't *sit out* if he doesn't. That's the worst thing you could do, and will end up hurting you in the long run."
