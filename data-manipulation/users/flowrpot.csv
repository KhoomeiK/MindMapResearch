I don’t have the money or the greatest insurance to get them removed so I’m avoiding that, but if it comes down to it I’ll obviously have no choice.

For the past couple days, the back of my mouth right where the wisdom teeth are on the bottom has been feeling sore, especially at night. It’s a bit red in the area and looks like there’s a small crevasse behind the tooth. Will this go away? What should I do?
