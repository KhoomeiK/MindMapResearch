Just be aware of your players and predict how they will feel about this. Hopefully they already understood how dark this campaign is before starting it, but especially when it comes to parents of babies and small children, I would not go too far with the hags in this campaign. Two of my players are new parents with a two month old, and knowing the mom pretty well, I’ve decided to change dream pastries. They will not be made out of literal children as I know that it’s possible that would really freak her out in her postpartum state."

CurseofStrahd,ff64he1,t1_ff5z2xv,1579618906.0,"Oooh I like that. I fretted over wether or not to run it because I don’t like the way it’s written. I changed a lot of it in the end and wanted my players who are used to being coddled by my husband dm that this campaign ain’t gonna be like that lol.

MakeupRehab,fd6hq9y,t3_ek0js3,1578191199.0,"I try to take at least one day a week without wearing any makeup. Only my moisturizer with spf and that’s it. I started doing this after having my baby girl. I’ve been thinking more about the pressures she will face one day and I don’t want her to grow up thinking makeup is a must to be beautiful. Similarly, I don’t want my toddler son to grow up thinking women always have to wear makeup. I try to use positive body talk around my kids and make sure they hear my husband compliment my beauty even when I have no makeup. I think these little things will hopefully add up to positive ways to think about women someday for both of them."
