And as far as denial? One buddy didn't realize he was putting away at least six to eight tall boys a night (he's trying to stick to one night a week after admitting it was a problem). Another didn't think rolling around with pocket-vodka was strange. Most of the people I know seem to drink at least 3-4 nights a week, but if asked would tell you 1-2."

I haven't stopped drinking, but I've decided that unless it's going to be a drinking night I'm not gonna bother.

But beer is this carb-bomb that just sits in your gut, and alcohol is literal poison, and people just train themselves not to notice."

A. Parents would enjoy watching with their children
