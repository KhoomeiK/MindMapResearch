I feel like the verdict is still out on whether lethal injections are comparatively that much more merciful"

Also you:

>fan-made content is always 100 times worse.

I'm not trying to jump on you for setting low expectations of a fan project - just seeing the link you posted gave me flashbacks! But I don't think it's fair to accuse people of downvote-brigading you just for lack of hype, all while you deny your comments are contradictory"
cats,fcxestw,t1_fcwoolq,1578061038.0,"Yeah, it's still going strong. Helps that enough time has passed since the Satanic panic that more people are aware of more positive examples for the hobby. Countless groups upload or stream games on YouTube and Twitch - one such group, Critical Role, features several well-known voice actors and pretty high production values, and is so popular fans made their animated adventure Kickstarter the most funded TV or film project ever."

technology,fcwaojq,t1_fcw42j2,1578021024.0,"Most people already have paid the IRS though.

Per the IRS website, for the 2018 tax year ~154,402,000 tax returns were filed and there were ~111,596,000 refunds (average refund of $2,860), meaning 72% of filers got a refund.

As many others have said, the IRS will audit or fine or otherwise penalize people for not doing their taxes/not paying the correct amount, so they must have some idea of what is owed. In that case, why do 72% of people still need to go through this process?"
dndmemes,fctrbmv,t3_einwls,1577955475.0,"Boo. The acronym Dnd/D&D has nothing to do with ""Family Feud"", so there's no pun or joke or twist of expectations.

Instead, say something like ""That reminds me, just got my hands on 6th edition!!"", pause, then pic"
boardgames,fcov61o,t1_fcn3wm6,1577842440.0,">But IMO if you throw the game you're playing *right now* for a chance at winning some future, unconnected game? That's unsportsmanlike, and a breach of social contract. Especially in a game that takes as much time investment as Diplomacy.

Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma exists for a reason. That player isn't just throwing the game just to have a tantrum, behavior in the current game affects future interactions. Most people are really bad at compartmentalizing and will bring previous experiences to the table the next time they sit down to play. 

If a player is betrayed and does nothing about it just because it is not immediately advantageous to win them the current game, opponents will probably remember that and be more likely to repeat those actions in the future.

>Plus, from a narrative perspective, you are playing as nations. If you really were a military/political leader making decisions in this war, and you lose that badly, you don't get a second chance. You die, your nation crumbles, game over.

Unless your opponents were trying to set themselves up as ""the good guys"", so they didn't completely wipe your country off the map. Germany stuck around after losing World War I.


>If you and all your mates consider this a valid strategy, good for you, it's no skin off my back. But I would never want to play Diplomacy with you.

I can completely understand your point of view. I just think there isn't anything wrong with demonstrating that every action has repercussions, as long as the table understands that going in"
