Now, I'm not a huge Billy fan.  She's kinda boring IMO. But look at the other nominees this year. She was clearly the best in every category she won.  Next time a boomer complains, just ask them what other nominee should have won instead."
KamikazeByWords,ffs0l2z,t1_ffrvvjv,1580170221.0,"Reddit is multi-generational now. Some of us here now were browsing reddit in college or high school while others of us were shitting ourselves and sucking on mama's tits.  Because it's the internet, a lot of people forget that.  I don't get her music either, but there weren't guys my current age going to the shows I went to when I was 16-17 either. Just let people be.

Edit: also, I just went and had a listen to the stuff I was into 15 years ago and it's not pretty, folks.  Lot's of cringe with very little good stuff sprinkled in.  And the grammys have always been a joke. My first year of college OK Go won best video with that treadmill shit and the Dixie chicks won best album. So, let's just pump our brakes and let them have their fortnite and their Billy"

It'll drag out well into election season.  This is round one of Impeachment.  Not only can the house draft new articles, there's no such thing as no double jeopardy in Impeachment AFAIK.  They can impeach him again for the same shit in light of new evidence and new testimony.  Idk how that'd play in terms of optics, but I'm pretty sure they *can* do it.

Most kids aren't shopping for their own insurance anyway. And odds are the state farm folks did something to support the school. And if your big gripe is targeting ads at kids, wait til you see the commercials on cable networks targeted at kids (Disney Channel, nickelodeon, CN, etc) lol"
