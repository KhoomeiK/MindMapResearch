IAmA,fcscm90,t1_fcs47wz,1577914664.0,"I used to think that way.  I've always been more of a hard rock / metal guy and most of the country music I was exposed to growing up was the generic Nashville style Garth Brooks clones who put on a cowboy hat and sang about stereotypical topics like trucks or the virtues of rural life vs. urban life and made the listener proud of his or her own life's limitations and willful ignorance.  But then I discovered more alternative / outlaw country like Steve Earle, Pat Green, and the classics like Willie and old school Bakersfield Sound practitioners like Merle Haggard and discovered that there was quite a bit of artistic merit in the genre if you just know where to look.  I like rock, but if all I had heard was Nickelback and Creed, I would think rock sucked too."

They would passed the discount on to their customers and the Lee King Palace would have been the most popular Chinese restaurant in the Birmingham Metro area.

Chattanooga,fcgnf8a,t1_fcgllw7,1577642023.0,"New routers vary I suppose like anything else.  If you're satisfied with you speed with one then that's fine, but there are some mesh systems under $200 that could make your speed even faster.  If you went that route you'd probably only need two points, one to use as the main router and the other to use as a mesh.  It would really depend on how centrally located the main internet coming into you house is and the exact architecture of your house but either way you might end up paying less for a basic mesh wifi system than you would a really powerful router that could cover your entire house.   Do you have your house wired with cat5e (or 6 or 7 or whatever cable) or do you just have your internet coming in at the one point where epb put it?"
Chattanooga,fcgkf8v,t3_eh7g14,1577641075.0,"Unless you live in a small, less than 1,000 square foot house or apartment, mesh networking is the way to go.  I use Google Wifi and it's good.   They've come out with an upgraded version, Nest Wifi, but it doesn't have ethernet backhaul capabilities like the previous generation and Ethernet connectivity is something you seem like you want.  Netgear makes a mesh system called the Orbi which might work for you, it has ethernet backhaul capabilities."

He had an issue with the Burger King ad though because he thought it might confuse children into to thinking he was endorsing a product.
