I wash my hair twice a week and workout 4/5, never have i ever had greasy or dirty hair due to workout sweat. I think it's because when your hair is already ""full"" of steam, it doesn't suck any more water in. In fact my hair stays straight even in humid weather and for days on end.."

First of all candles are meant to relax through their smell, so the atmosphere has to be mostly calm..try to put that feeling into the design.

By looking at your illustration i think of some fruity/tropical scent, you can keep the elements but it needs to be simpler and more chill (no mirrored tiger for example)"
