My dad about hugged the kid to death thanking him,
My Dad wasn't a small man when he was young,
He used left car engines (Give you the idea how strong in his youth he was)
My Dad I think went to kids parents ,
Shaked their hands,
Thanked them for raising such caring young man ,
Told them we needed more good parents like them,
The boy and my brother became best friends, 
So it was WIN/WIN

Nope.

Is he proves to be more responsible, 
Careful with it,

Let her have an all women baby shower,
Then later they could have a Dinner celebrating their first time parenthood together with family and friends!
That way they both get what they want,
No need for drama,
But a great need for commonsense and logic as well maturity nowadays it seems .
Especially if they are going to co parent a human being!🤔"

entitledparents,fdeqlry,t1_fde8ugj,1578344558.0,"My Condolences for your loss,
My mother's boyfriend back in early 2000s,
Committed suicide, 
He found out he had cancer,
He was a very proud man,
The thought of becoming too sick to care for his elderly mother, 
Or not marrying my mom,
Was too much for him,
He became very depressed, 
He went into his mother's kitchen, 
Shot himself one early morning, 
My mother and His mother found him,
I was the third person to see him,
That is a sight I will live with the rest my life,
I believe it broke my mother,
She loved him very much, 
Combine with losing her baby brother a few years later to a heart attack, 
She was never the same,
I respected and thought a great deal of him,
He loved my mother, treated her like a queen, 
He treated me like his own child too,
I hope you have friends who you can lean on OP, 
Not the same as your brother, 
But hopefully you have people in your life that will help you through this tragedy, 
Positive Thoughts and Blessings for 2020 be a better year for you,
May you be Blessed to find Peace and Happiness, 
Remember your brother for all the good memories, 
Try to think of the Positive over the Negative, 
Not easy I understand, 
But I honor those I've lost ,
By the good memories I have of them,
To keep a part of them alive,
If only in my mind and heart .💛"
