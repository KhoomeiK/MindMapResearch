AskHR,ff9us8k,t3_es9qya,1579721876.0,"I would encourage you to go to HR regarding the racist comments, if other information is disclosed in that conversation that would be fine too. Hopefully it will lead to coaching to improve his managerial style.

There's no law against a bad boss. There's no law saying you must disclose a death to your work, there may be a policy if you're taking bereavement leave but you still don't need to discuss specific details with your boss. There are laws against saying racist things so I'd encourage you to report those.

This is a bad boss in, possibly, a bad environment/company that you clearly have no passion for nor desire for growth. Perhaps this is a sign that it's time to move on. You spend a lot of time at work, it's worth finding somewhere you like. 

Best of luck"

I have found a private rescue who have committed to helping 1 of my 3 strays, I am hoping I can push for all 3 to be helped. I do recognize that specialized care is often needed for feral cats. It's not as simple as walk into a vet and hand over a pet."

Still, South Central and Downey are the worst - they just have so many animals. This is the perfect example of a place where free spay and neuter would be most critical. But also stopping backyard breeding and using animals as a source of income.

In the future I would encourage you to take any stray animals to shelters in West LA, Hollywood, etc. Adopting from South LA and Downey shelters is highly encouraged though."
LosAngeles,ff3ke68,t1_ff2rgcb,1579542916.0,From my understanding there's a very long wait list for help with community cats. I've tried to contact several feral cat organizations but I've not been able to get very far with help for these 2 young adult cats.
LosAngeles,ff2i0uy,t3_er5l9y,1579507012.0,"Los Angeles is no kill. I believe they reached their goal last year.

I would like to see resources put into free spay and neuter services, that's a better way to move towards no kill. (I know there's low cost and help for low income but I'd like to see it extended to everyone. I have 3 stray cats I'd like to TNR but finding resources to help is challenging and paying out of my own pocket isn't sustainable)."

AskHR,fev7xei,t1_fetp51o,1579394261.0,"Commercial buildings replacing pipes simply to permit higher ply paper is highly unlikely. The solution is always lower ply; that's why you see 1 ply in many public/commercial bathrooms. Also remember people still flush tampons, pads, hand towels, q-tips, ""flushable"" wipes and other nonsense. 1 ply paper is a simple solution for toilets when you cannot control the volume. Every commercial landlord I've ever dealt with in the US simply says use 1 ply."
AskHR,feu1xmf,t1_fetp51o,1579382313.0,"Possibly. I think any pipes have trouble when you're flushing half a roll per use. I mean, at least courtesy flush along the way to ease the load."
AskHR,fesiv7j,t3_eqh8xk,1579365693.0,"I would encourage you to talk to an office manager, HR or high level manager about the lack of soap and paper towels in the men's rest room; strategically I would approach a female in one of these roles about it as they're likely unaware and may be more motivated to resolve it than a man who already knows and is likely shrugging it off.

The quality of the items in the women's rest room is secondary to the fact that you have absolutely nothing so I wouldn't even bring that up. Just say as an absolute basic need, soap and hand towels are necessary. I'd also ask them to put up signs stating that all employees must wash their hands after using the restroom. It won't mean everyone will but hopefully some will.

The 1 ply I can understand. My team moved into a brand new building and within days the men's toilets were clogged with toilet paper. We fixed it and within a week they were clogged again. I had to reduce the ply in order to have functioning toilets. When there are significantly more men than women, the volume of toilet paper going through the pipes means changes have to be made."

It sounds like you work in a gossipy, badly managed office and this is just par for the course. 

But, that being said, there's absolutely no reason any random co-worker seeing you and your boss together in an office should be questioning why or what is going on. My answer in that situation would be ""we're working on a project"". If you're answering in any way that indicates that you're teaching your boss how to do payroll you're not only causing gossip, you're also undermining your boss. Why are you engaging people by answering?"
