ftm,ffbi4hn,t1_ffbhf2q,1579766356.0,"I’m glad you at least went and explored a bit of the unknown. There’s going to be ignorant people who deny science and studies everywhere you go. The fact that there are flat-earthers and anti-vax people just proves the point even more. While it is frustrating, the only thing you can really do is acknowledge that it exists and turn the other way. 


Have a good night man! (—_—)zZZ"
ftm,ffbgwe5,t3_espcpv,1579764759.0,"In my opinion, its always good to get different perspectives. I also occasionally browse detrans subreddits as a way to understand the “other side” of people where transitioning wasnt for them.


Buuuuuut the BIG point is that, while I understand there are people who regret it, I know for myself that it has made me happy and my life better. And I see a similar situation for you! Transitioning for you has been wonderful and a pleasant experience. The deciding factor in many of these cases is based on you, not what “everyone else (seems) to be doing.” 


Final notes: I think a big thing us transguys forget sometimes (most of the time) is to love ourselves. While getting validation from others is important, the most important thing in anyone’s life (not just trans) is to learn to appreciate and accept yourself. Once you begin to understand and love yourself, diving into other groups with dissenting/different opinions (the detrans subreddit for example) and living through life dealing with transphobia will become a lot easier. 


And of course, if you need support, just know that r/ftm has got your back :)      if you need someone to message, im sleeping soon but feel free to message me :) hang in there man you got this!"

lgbt,fc2dywt,t1_fc2dtgw,1577354644.0,I am totally gonna say this tomorrow. Thank you so much! I cant think about how my dad would argue against it.
lgbt,fc2dmd4,t1_fc2d0s2,1577354040.0,"I will send both of these to him. I bet his comment on the first one is that they are “lab” mice and therefore are not from/in nature. But we’ll see! 

Idk what he has to say about the second one. It seems super convincing to me, but he’s a scientist so maybe he’ll say the numbers arent convincing."
lgbt,fc2dg2s,t1_fc2cwdw,1577353736.0,"I brought this up as well with him before, apologies, he went to bed. His response is that all of that research is crap and is full of observation bias and that there is no research that can point out any specific gene or anything biological that makes people homosexual. Which in turn means that its a choice."
lgbt,fc2dck9,t1_fc2csyw,1577353566.0,"Ok, my dad just went to sleep, but I did ask him at what point he found women attractive. From what I remember, he said that he found women attractive in high school just naturally. Having a natural physical response to women. He’s never questioned it because he knows that men are attracted to women because they are biologically fueled to reproduce. My mom backs him on the vice versa. Women want to reproduce naturally and need a man to do that. 


He followed it by saying something like, animals base instinct is to reproduce. So heterosexuality is something that has to be programmed and fueled biologically otherwise species will die out. 


I will follow this comment up tomorrow morning when he wakes up."
