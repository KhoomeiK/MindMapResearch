news,ffoyg6u,t1_ffma4i0,1580083281.0,"Those are just city proper numbers. Citing the number of people inside city limits for a US city is extremely misleading since the US is made of tons and tons of suburbs. Dallas has close to 5 million people if we look at the number of people in the urban area.

However, let's take your 8.8 number. That's the number of people living in the urban area for Wuhan. You can't compare urban population to city limit population and expect it to be fair.

Saying that Wuhan is bigger than NYC is very misleading since the US and China are governed differently at the local level. NYC has a metro population of about 20 million while Wuhan has a metro population of about 19 million. While they are close, NYC is still bigger. Metro population is always going to be the most accurate representation of a city since our local governments are so fractured into small towns and cities all surrounding a ""core"" city."

todayilearned,ffcw0vd,t1_ffcsv3z,1579808437.0,"Here's my thought on it: trying to make sure that ""women and children go first"" only increases loading times in a situation where time is everything. Don't worry about giving up your seat for someone, because all you're doing is delaying everything meaning the total number of people saved decreases.

Think about being on an airplane where you and someone else are trying to be polite and let the other person leave the plane first. All you're doing is delaying yourselves and the rest of the passengers behind you. Now that's probably not a life and death situation so it's no big deal to waste 5-10 seconds being polite, but when you're on a sinking ship, the best thing you can do is get on a lifeboat as quickly in an orderly fashion as possible as any ""acts of sacrifice"" will just hold things up.

""Terminal time"" or the amount of time that a vehicle/vessel spends loading and unloading is currently the weak link in transportation. Look at a plane, it only takes 6 hours to cross the US but it takes 30 minutes to board and 30 minutes to deplane. Trains are some of the most efficient cargo carriers but it takes too long to load and unload them which is why we are so reliant on semi-trucks. So any delay that causes an increase in terminal time is possibly the worst kind of delay."

They all said it was due to the BS being forced on them by corporate which I never really figured out what that was.

We also started pigeonholing ourselves into only a few kinds of bikes. If you wanted something that wasn't a Diamondback or a Fuji, you were out of luck because that was pretty much all we sold. Even our own employees, (who got a 20% discount on certain bikes), were going to other shops and buying Cannondales and Specialized bikes just because we sold such a limited number of models.

Also, in order for public transit to sustain itself, it needs high levels of ridership so a well planned system is going to have busses/trains that are mostly full. Not necessarily people standing 100% of the time and being pushed into each other full, but I've gotten on COTA busses before where I was the only person on the bus. That's not at all efficient and means that some part of the system is poorly planned.

Maybe not life changing but they got rid of the Performance Package for the 2019s and just made it standard so if your old one doesn't have it then it can be quite an upgrade, plus sunroof, leather seats, better headlights, and DCC. And if it's the DSG, the 19s have the 7 speed compared to the 6 speed in older models. So there's quite a bit that's changed even if it's just little stuff. I'm not sure when VW started putting Android Auto/Apple Carplay into their cars but that might be added too. Or just an upgrade of the infotainment console in general.
