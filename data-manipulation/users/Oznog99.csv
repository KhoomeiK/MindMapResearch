worldnews,ffu4py4,t1_fft9lqq,1580234446.0,"Overall HIFU does have a great track record for dropping PSA to a very low number.  Sounds like an exception.  There are questions over when it works best- one thing they know is that for larger prostates with tumors on the far side, HIFU cannot focus ultrasound that far away.  But they're not 100% sure where that cutoff point should be.

The FDA did approve HIFU, but was not clear on when it should be used.  And there's like about a 3 yr gap before insurance industry starts covering newly approved things.  Part of this is negotiating a price structure.

IIRC only one insurance covers it so far, and only as a backup if radiation treatment was unsuccessful.

I'm wondering how well the HIFU industry does in this period- from what I'm seeing, pretty well actually.  The lack of insurance involvement means they can charge whatever they want for the treatment.  

A young person diagnosed today could likely be a case for ""this could become serious in 10 yrs so we recommend removal, and we might as well do it now because we don't have any other options but 'watchful waiting' "" but a new answer could be ""or, we can do HIFU wholly out-of-pocket today for $25K, or wait a year or two for HIFU to be fully covered, you pay a $5K deductible for the year and save you the prostatectomy AND $20K  in expense""

I know it won't help you, in fact this may hurt more to know, but for those reading- they're starting to offer HIFU/TULSA ultrasonic ablation for some cases of prostate cancer.  It selectively ablates away just the cancer, not the whole prostate.  

It seems to be effective at stopping cancer but reliably preserves sexual and urinary function."
worldnews,ffso6vp,t1_ffsltap,1580186860.0,"Complicated answer.  Blood PSA and ""the finger"" are pretty simple and easy and no direct harm.

But they don't prove things one way or the other.  Additional screening can involve biopsy which can be seen as a more difficult thing.  There are like 4 other types of testing, too.

 ""clinically insignificant"" prostate cancers (that won't actually kill you or even trouble you before you die of something else) are quite common, esp in seniors.  This is a really complex question to guess which ones warrant treatment and which don't, because treatment comes with major side effects.

The ""harm"" of some of this testing is possibly resulting in unnecessary treatment that could cost major loss in quality-of-life, or stressing people out with telling them they have cancer but don't really need to do anything about it for now and that can cause some MAJOR stress.

What's your age?"
worldnews,ffsi99i,t3_euq30g,1580182353.0,"""Testing"" is problematic:

1.  Prostate-related urinary symptoms don't correlate much with cancer.  Enlargement causing urinary symptoms is usually benign and actual cancer often doesn't cause any urinary symptoms or pain.

2. ""the finger"" reliably tests for enlargement, but only finds lumps that may be cancer in a certain area of the prostate.   But cancer may occur on the other side, and may not show lumps.

3. the PSA test is also not all that useful.  Again, some elevated PSA is nothing, while some clinically cancers occur without ever raising PSA levels.  But it is the primary screening tool.  

4.  A biopsy can *definitely* tell you if you do have cancer, but only if the biopsy needle actually goes through it.  But there's a chance it can miss it.  It's a transrectal needle gun with some notable risks, and a very frustrating process is even if it comes up negative, with elevated PSA they may recommend repeating the biopsy all over again later, on the assumption that maybe they missed finding a cancer.

5.  There's MRI testing and some new urine tests that may be able to more reliably indicate cancer or no-cancer.  

6.  Prostate cancer is pretty common and often so slow-growing that risks of surgery don't outweigh benefits. There's a complicated rating system.

There's several testing newcomers.  Like SelectMDX is a quick, awkward rectal prostate massage (seriously don't worry about it) to express some fluid and and a urine test.  It claims to be highly certain at both saying whether you do, or don't, have clinically significant cancer.  But it is not covered by a lot of insurance providers.

Prostate removal IS pretty serious.  They don't remove part of it, but always the whole thing.  The surgery is easy now in itself  but urinary incontinence is very common, as is lasting impotence that ED drugs may not help with.  Once the prostate is removed, a man will be sterile and cannot ejaculate semen during orgasm (unlike vasectomy).

It is not a simple question as to whether removal of the prostate is a good idea.  Not all cancer is ""significant"" (will kill you), but prostate removal brings lifelong consequences.  They do promote a ""nerve-sparing prostate removal"" (that won't cause ED), but what I keep seeing is it's basically a lie.  ED is still very common and doesn't go away.

There are some existing radiation treatments that don't involve removal, but they're pretty serious too.

There ARE a couple of new nonsurgical alternatives- transrectal High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU), and MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA).  They're actually showing up as effective at selectively ablating *just* the cancer, preserving all sexual and urinary function.  It has a very promising track record where it reduces the PSA blood test to a very low level, although it will take decades to fully verify this means cancer is stopped permanently, and if that's true across all age groups and other factors.

However, they're currently in an odd place where the FDA is not clear on when they're approved for all cases, and most insurance will not pay for it.  It's expensive but people do pay out of pocket for it.

It does raise interesting questions for slow-growing prostate cancer.  In younger men, they often suggest removal of the prostate because you'll likely live long enough for it to kill you, but this can mean living a long time with pretty serious consequences.  And there's a logic of ""we can remove it now and be sure to end it, or we could wait, but probably have to remove it later anyways, but with additional risks of not being able to stop the cancer at that point""

Now, with HIFU/TULSA, or maybe new stuff, on the horizon, it can change that logic.  Slow-growing cancer in younger men might have a strong case for ""wait until effective, covered-under-insurance prostate-sparing procedures are on the market"".  That may only be a few years.  Some of that is already true.

Moreover, it changes the game for screening.  Because there is a LOT of controversy over expanding screening (PSA/finger/biopsy), because it often keeps finding more cases where the existing (serious) options- removal or radiation- isn't warranted, so they just distress people but change nothing.  Or result in more unnecessary treatment like removal.  Now there's actually a possibility of something logical- ""ok, small cancer, that's easy to ablate with few consequences, so let's get it now and send you home""."

todayilearned,ff827x4,t1_ff7jcnr,1579664060.0,">evidence has come up from fire investigators that it wasn’t his fault at all, it was a radiator or an outlet, I forget which

The testimony of county's assistant fire chief, Doug Fogg, about ""pour patterns"" being proof of an accelerant being used to start the fire was discredited.  He didn't know what he was talking about on that front.  That was garbage and shouldn't have been in the trial.

Nothing proved him innocent, though.  There is a LOT of other evidence here.  There was a lab test that DID show an accelerant was there.  Willingham claimed to have gone back into the house, except he hadn't inhaled any smoke, and no significant burns.

And a LOT of difficult-to-explain behavior of Willingham:

>Jurors said there were other odd details that sealed Willingham's fate. Ronald Franks, a Corsicana Fire Department paramedic, testified he returned to the home a few days after the fire. He found Willingham, who complained that his dart set was either burned or stolen from the wreckage.

>Then, Franks testified, Willingham told him investigators would likely find cologne in the floor samples they were testing. He told Franks ""he had poured cologne on the floor because the children had liked the smell of that cologne."" He said he had poured it from the bathroom through the hallway to where the children were found, Franks said.

>Jurors also heard from Willingham's neighbors. They testified that as the house south of Dallas burned to the ground, he was crouched down outside, screaming. But they also said he moved his car away from the house while his children were trapped inside.

>Manuel Vasquez, the state fire marshal whose credentials as a 30-year veteran firefighter and investigator were established on the stand, was unequivocal in his condemnation of Willingham, saying the defendant ""told me a story of pure fabrication."""

explainlikeimfive,ff6f87l,t1_ff644ov,1579625899.0,"What confuses me is burping relies on gravity to let gas separate and rise to the top where the esophageal sphincter can let it out without releasing any reflux (most of the time).

I believe this is healthy.

OK wait.  There's a charity demolition derby?  And they hired celebrities to *drive* it?  You know there's a chance you could get whiplash or crushed, right?  

Also, cars do not explode.  And demolition derbies would have a minimum amount of fuel onboard, and should be in a hardened fuel cell.  So the amount of fuel and the rate it can spill out should be very limited."

So it's gonna be a good long hella boring sequence to get all your assets in position to actually engage, because of all those damn pawns.

Unless there's a good strategy to send your rooks out with no backup to kill off pawns from across the board.  I don't know if that means a bunch of pawns get murdered before the main fight or you just kill one pawn but lose your rook.

The prob is, either way, the game is very simplistic and predictable at that stage, as only the rooks are actually usable for like the first 200 moves.  So there's not many ways this can go down, and pretty easy to figure out."

Part of insects and nematodes.  It is often symbiotic.

A lot of the danger of nematode (worms) infection in mammals may be an immune response to *wolbachia* in the worms.

One strategy of killing nematodes like heartworms inside mammals is to use an antibiotic that targets *wolbachia*.  Some nematodes cannot survive without it in their microbiome and will decline and eventually die off.

This avoids using more toxic chemicals that kill the nematodes directly, and may prevent a crisis where the nematodes die off suddenly and decay, exposing the immune system with a flood of *wolbachia*."
