dogs,fenjaal,t3_eq3ul3,1579285896.0,"I would skip any dog in the sporting group or the herding group. Both will be high energy level and too much work to keep exercised, unless they are middle or senior aged. Husky type dogs are built to run for miles. Skip them.  Terriers will likely cause the cat to have second thoughts about living with you.  

I have always liked the Newfie and the Berber. 

That being said, it boils down to the individual dog, I believe, rather than the breed.  I would reach out to local rescue organizations and outline your priorities (low energy level, good with chaos, excellent with kids and cats). Then be willing to wait for the right one."

Next, if you like yellows, go to the paint store and select several cards of yellows that you like. Keep it subtle, though. Remember that the wall color is a backdrop for the room, not the most interesting thing. 

Once you have narrowed down your selections to one or two colors, buy a small sample pot of each color. Paint swatches on several walls in the room so you can see how they react to the light. 

Hope this helps some.   If you guess wrong, don’t panic. It’s just paint. You can repaint if necessary, but anything would be a improvement over the concrete bunker thing that your living with now."
