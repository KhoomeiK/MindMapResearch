bipolar,ffh6kx2,t1_ffh68br,1579924530.0,"I have been able to manage my appetite. I started earlier this week. My schedule on Tuesdays/Thursdays is wake up at 6 am, leave for school at 7 am, have classes from 8 am to 12:15 pm with no breaks. And ironically, I’m actually hungrier if I eat breakfast than I do if I don’t eat breakfast. I find chewing gum and drinking lots of water helps with the hunger. 

Not gonna lie, that first day after class I immediately went to McDonald’s to get the 4 for $4 deal lol. But I have been trying to eat less calories/healthier too. It’s hard because it’s king cake season."

poshmark,ffgkjph,t3_etgyr0,1579908355.0,"I kind of feel turned off by stock photos, specifically because it doesn’t authentically represent the item. I personally use my own photos. I think anyone can get decent photos with a white sheet from Walmart, a camera phone, and Lightroom mobile. And maybe a steamer if your clothes are wrinkly."

PlanetZoo,ffg3z2n,t3_eteo1i,1579897952.0,This reminds me of that meme where a school’s shortest cheerleader is standing next to the school’s tallest volley ball player.

ipad,ff95c11,t1_ff6q2cx,1579705207.0,"I don’t use one on mine. I tried a couple different matte screen protector and they were annoying. I do have scratches on my screen, despite never dropping the iPad and having a protective case that can cover the screen. I would advise getting a good screen protector and putting it on as soon as you get the iPad. Mine is the iPad Pro 12.9 2018 model."
bipolar,ff8xh2i,t1_ff85vrv,1579699262.0,"Nothing helps my anxiety without making my depression feel worse. He added Rexulti as an adjunct therapy because studies show that Rexulti, when paired with an antidepressant, can help with the antidepressant. 

He ended up switching me from Trintellix to Wellbutrin. Still on the Rexulti. I don’t know if the Rexulti really helps but it doesn’t seem to make things worse so that’s always a plus."
poshmark,ff3nfsw,t3_erfwfo,1579544797.0,"I’ve read on here that anything 20 or more years old is considered vintage.

I’m 21. I found my mom’s old maternity clothes from when she was pregnant with me. I have them listed as “vintage 90’s”"
BeautyGuruChatter,ff1ypg2,t3_eqn29b,1579489249.0,"To me, it’s not so much the price or brand as it is the style I look for. It disgusts me how designer brands get away with being _so fucking ugly_. It’s like how men get away with looking ugly more so than women. But if some of those clothes were sold at Walmart nobody would be buying them. 

I buy cheap fast fashion, so maybe I’m not much better. But at least Shein or Forever 21 isn’t trying to fool me with overpriced ugly ass clothes."
BeautyGuruChatter,fezx3ob,t3_eqzon4,1579462807.0,"dang it, now I’ll have to budget my money so that I can buy my jade face roller _and_ my jade vagina egg."
