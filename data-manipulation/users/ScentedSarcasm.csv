There's not even a hypothetical figurative vacuum, because even without a relationship, **I** am still there. I deserve to have my life together for myself. That's enough motivation for me to not give up, to keep working on it. You seem to be the complete opposite.

And I don't ever want to need someone to be in a relationship with me. I certainly wouldn't mind meeting someone I want to be in a relationship with. I googled quickly because I thought I had read a quote on that once but found a short article that puts it in better words than I ever could: [Here it is!](https://womenforone.com/its-better-to-be-wanted-than-needed-by-asha-dahya/)"

I linked a study that features the key point **""Detriments associated with gonadectomy at any age include various cancers, orthopedic problems including anterior cruciate ligament injury, and obesity.""** including the necessary research to back that up, therefore proving that spay / neuter HAS long-term negative effects. So, what's the problem here?

I never said neutering a dog is ALWAYS bad. I can see the necessity for population control, for medical reasons like pyometra etc. and even people chosing it as an option because it doesn't increase the risk for a certain cancer in a certain bread too much, but provides the benefit of decreasing the risk for other specific cancers. I'm just sick of reading ""But it has only benefits!

Maybe I'm expressing it in a weird way (not a native speaker), but for me it's seriously alarming how often people imply that not being married = you're doing it wrong.

No waste, no regret.

So, maybe YOU are happiest with a small collection because you have a very specific taste, because you don't wear them often or because you simply want to spend only a certain amount of money on perfume.

dogs,fdldr2l,t3_elvfqy,1578521847.0,"Spaying them too soon can mess with their physical and mental development. Spaying them after their first heat still reduces the risk of mammary tumors, but allows a longer uninterrupted development. Spaying them at all increases the risk of different other cancer forms.  
Honestly, I don't spay my dogs unless it's necessary because there's an acute medical problem. I can keep them on a leash for 6 weeks of the year (one heat cycle usually falls into the time when dogs have to be on a leash here anyway to protect wildlife) and I know which (male) dogs to avoid during those times."

My neighbour's dog never had a bad experience in her life. Energetic little dachshund mix, guards their little garden and is healthy, but she only tolerates one very short walk per day. You try a different route and she'll huff, sit down, look back and act like you're expecting her to climb Mount Everest. Sometimes dogs are the happiest when close to home."

Take her outside on a longer leash to a close, calm and boring spot and wait it out. Immediately reward with praise and treats when she does her business, don't comment on any accidents in the house and don't get angry. Those are on your past self for using pads and punishment. ;)  
Same with your older dog, especially if he has no problem going potty while you're watching, maybe Elizabeth will make the connection that it's actually ok outside."

I have an ED myself. I know how much it sucks and how little one can sometimes do when the urge to binge comes along. It's not even about wanting to enjoy food and therefore stealing snacks from family, roommates etc. because it's the good stuff. It's a really strong urge that drives people to eat stupid shit like flour with water or cocoa powder straight from the box or even meat when they're vegetarian. Sometimes there's no stopping until you're so full it hurts and you can't properly breathe anymore. It's the physical manifestation of a psychological problem and a simple ""Don't binge"" won't cure anyone.

That being said, it's never ok to take someone elses stuff. If it happens, an apology and offering to replace the food is the minimum you should expect from your mother. She knows she's prone to binges that are not planned, so she should have a food stache just so she doesn't steal your food.  
I've lived in a flat with several bulimic people. We managed to not eat each other's stuff on a daily basis and so can your mother."
