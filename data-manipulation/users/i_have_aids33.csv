Brawlstars,ff6zou7,t1_ff6x3sz,1579638199.0,Mr. P has high skill mechanics so it made sense to be mythic.

Brawlstars,fenmfmr,t1_fenm500,1579287816.0,"If there were no brawler kills, the mode would be literally just walking up to a boss and shooting it. The player with the highest dps brawler would win most of the time, meaning most brawlers would be unviable. It would also require even less skill because shooting a slow moving robot and dodging a few lasers is quite easy."
Brawlstars,fenlzv7,t1_fenh0k9,1579287546.0,Brawler kills are part of the mode.

Brawlstars,fenks1w,t3_eq4bs9,1579286802.0,you might accidentally break walls you dont want to break.
Brawlstars,fenkm0w,t3_eq4dud,1579286700.0,You can get a legendary on your first day in clash royale if your good enough. But in brawl stars it all luck.

Brawlstars,fehurg6,t1_fehu2z0,1579124269.0,"Yes, you get extra gold when you no longer need power points, but not all players need gold, and it makes sense to open the boxes when a new brawler is released; you will probably obtain it on the first day, and level it up a few levels.

It also is useful to save boxes if you have every brawler in the game; for example, I am only missing crow right now, but I will not open my boxes. I will wait until a new non-legendary brawler comes out, and open boxes then. This way, I will get the brawler on day 1, and also have a chance of getting crow. If I dont save up, I will have an equal chance of getting crow, but a 0% chance of getting any other brawler, as no other brawler is released yet.

So basically, for max or near max players, saved boxes will get more value on average."

3. There is another problem but I cant be bothered to explain"
