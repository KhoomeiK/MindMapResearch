programming,fcv77kk,t1_fcu7ino,1577996075.0,"> This seems to be a shield people hide behind a lot: Good software costs money.

All commercial software costs money because you have to pay developers regardless of the quality of the code.

Higher quality software takes more time to build than low quality software. For any substantial software product (several tens of millions of lines of code), there are hundreds to thousands of bugs that don't get fixed because there are other higher priorities (often features that bring in additional revenue and keep the business growing). At some point bug fixing reaches a point of diminishing returns.

&nbsp;

Higher quality software takes more money to build than lower quality software.

&nbsp;

Businesses have to balance features, stability, performance and how to allocate resources to keep the company growing. It's a tricky problem to solve and is more art than science."
programming,fctqer3,t3_eipb5c,1577954155.0,"The business case is typically more important than the technical requirements.

* A business problem needs to be solved by software.
* There is only so much time and money.
* Engineers need to write that software in the allocated schedule. 
* People that complain about software quality can lead by example and work twice as hard with the same pay to make their software less buggy and more  performant. Did I hear?  ""No, thank you.""

&nbsp;

While I understand the sentiment of the article, software is rarely written in a vacuum where there is infinite time and resources. If you can't work under the business constraints, then perhaps software engineering isn't the right career choice."

This is why investment strategies increase bond allocation as a person ages.

Bogleheads,fc6aa20,t1_fc5ht7z,1577475888.0,"The 100% VTI/VTSAX strategy is index picking. There are all these indices and somehow VTI is the ""best"".

&nbsp;

Buffett picks stocks and is highly skilled so I understand him recommending 100% VTI.

&nbsp;

Bogle however pushed diversification hard, so I never understood why he would suggest U.S only and to avoid international exposure (his argument that US has large exposure to international wasn't completely convincing). My suspicion is he was a closet index picker, meaning he thought the US was the country with the best chance of high returns and went all in on it.

&nbsp;

I argue that going VT or 30% to 40% international won't make a huge difference (since allocations are not too different); the second and third options are close enough to be a coin toss. Returns should be similar.

VT/VTWAX is the purest form of diversification since you do not control the US/international allocation. It is the simplest strategy. The downside is the tax events are harder to control (you can't split up domestic and international in retirement/non-retirement accounts)

&nbsp;

When asking the question:

""What is the best allocation?""

It's usually asking:

""Which allocation will give me the best return over the long run?""
