Iirc, Sam says they are committed to 6 months of D20, but if they aren't profitable by then, he doesn't have any money left to put up for it. But that's just D20. There won't be any more just goofy scetches with Brennan. No more company CEO videos. No Ultramechatron villain Brennan.

I'm glad there's a chance at more D20, but sad that Brennan will be in fewer projects."

This means that OP can borrow the game for the duration of the rental but begins paying a late fee after that time unless they renew the rental. If they have already exhausted the renewals, they must return the rental or begin paying fines.

If there is no waitlist for that title, OP may be able to simply visit the library to return the rental and then simply check it back out.

If there *is* a waitlist, they will be unable to check the item back out and instead must enter the waitlist thenselves."

The user manual shows a wide selection of exercises that can be performed with just the one machine. Is anyone familiar? I'm looking for a workout routine. (Sidenote, how the eff am I supposed to keep track of my pace while rowing?! I don't know what 18 vs 22 feels like! The machine doesn't seem to accurately track it either)

So far I've only been using the rower. I have the resistance set to 3 and I'm trying to focus on my form, but even after half an hour I'm not feeling any soreness/tiredness in my arms/shoulders/core/back, just my legs. I'm not totally out of shape, so I wasn't expecting to be blasted after each workout, but I've never regularly worked out so I expected at least some soreness... Do I have the wrong expectations of the rower or do I need to work on my form more?"
