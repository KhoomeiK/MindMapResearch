AskReddit,ffh1skk,t3_etcyd6,1579920810.0,"Multiply the number of working therapists at least 4 fold in the US. There needs to be more degrees of mental health treatment. You can go to a therapist max 53 hours a year, but going in there's a huge gap between emotional knowledge of therapists compared to patients. It's like I've broken my leg, and it's bleeding. And I have to solve this problem myself through Google searches. Have health insurance? Mental health care might as well not exist. Going one hour a week when you need critical treatment is like going to an urgent Care center when you need a hospital. Prescriptions aren't covered on insurance, or if they are, are more expensive than price shopping at stores without using insurance.

If you manage to get a therapist, you start on a new plates where you need to go through several, like friendship/dating before you find the right personality fit. Each visit, $50+ a week while you are not able to get treatment, and your mental health worsens. If you are poor, or live in a country without health insurance coverage, you lose hope."
