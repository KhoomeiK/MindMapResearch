Now you want it just because I liked your film? No, sorry. I don't just give people free services. And you can't expect that people would.

At the beginning I really didn't want to answer, I was thinking to myself  ""It's ok, you do not have to convince to anybody"" but yes, I do not want to convince but I want to fight for my values until the end, what you consider naive and stupid is what can actually could be revolutionary in independent filmmaking. Paying $5000 for marketing sounds better? Yes, you probably took years to create your fandom but it took years to others filmmakers too; and if they are at the beginning and they will continue they might be even more lucky than you with their projects. I co-founded a collective of filmmakers in London 4 years ago, if I had to think like you or if others were thinking like you, I would be nowhere now."

Ok let me be more clear, so if somebody reach you with the promotion of his work (work that you appreciate), you think it's completely naive and stupid to propose him to do a mutual promotion (since that person seems to appreciate your work too)? Really? You really do not see the benefith that comes from this agreement? 

Why should anyone promote their work? You haven't given a good answer to that single, important question. > Because promotion even WITHOUT marketing brings visibility, which can be the most important thing for filmmakers. If you are asking ""why"" like ""why they do feel like promoting"" I think I answered already, if you appreciate somebody's work and the other side appreciate your work too, I don't understand why shouldn't exist an exchange of favors."
Filmmakers,feei2m1,t1_feegaix,1579034185.0,"Here we are, another big one who want to RE-INVENT what I said. Did I whining about something? Ok, you want to IMAGINE my situation, do it. But I wasn't even mention my project. How do you dare to assume what I wanted to say with my post? Who are you to say something like this? It's not just about my work. I have a community of filmmakers and they are all in the same situation. They all ASK to be promoted and nobody want to promote others. If you write privately I can happily send the link to my community in London which is not huge but decent to prove that I am not saying any lie and the point of my post was just to highlight a reality. And who says that a work which is not valuable should be promoted? Of course, everyone should choose the project which is more interesting for them in order to promote something in which they believe."
Filmmakers,fee1wba,t1_fee0rkm,1579024675.0,"Hi, thank you so much for this comment, I appreciate to read someone sharing my point of view instead of the usual words ""marketing"" ""useless post"" etc... I have in mind to start something similar, even if it will be an unsuccessful attempt, the idea is to try to make people remember that art and community should come before money, then eventually money come too."
Filmmakers,fedb7l4,t1_fed2u4y,1579006383.0,"well, for me stupidity is avoiding anything that could benefit our work, including mutual promotion. Therefor it's not my post of being stupid but the opposite attitude."
Filmmakers,fec3pkt,t1_fec2aaz,1578966201.0,"MH... GREAT... So because you weren't sure about what I was trying to say instead of asking politely what kind of plan I was suggesting (God help us if it's not a proper marketing plan) and if I could explain myself better maybe showing some examples if I had, you assumed I was expressing ""I know better than everyone else"". Look, now I understand your problem, and this is really the last message I am writing to you because this is a waste of time, not promoting others' project, this, here, now, sending messages to you is waste of my time. Why? Because you probably feel so miserable and small in your life that if somebody is just trying to start a conversation using a gif from a famous movie, you feel ""threatened"" and you think that this person means ""I know better than everyone else"". It's definitely your problem, not mine. And this is really my last message. I am not going to read or reply any of your fantasies anymore. I wish you a nice day, evening, night or whatever."

Can you please leave this conversation if you are going to ""INVENT"" what I said in my post? In this moment you are definitely the TRUMP of the situation, not me, and you are in every way possible, even inventing things that I didn't say just to prove you are better -you are not, even though you would probably be the best head of marketing of Coca Cola or any other cr\*\*\* brand."
Filmmakers,febyqra,t1_febx34h,1578964402.0,"Another very unrespectful comment. In my opinion you are simply writing ""fluff"" there is no better way to hide your own incompetence accusing others of being incompetent. Really. If your post was correct hystory of cinema magazines and news papers were completely useless. However, I am not even talking about blog, I am talking about youtube, vimeo, instagram, facebook, thousands and thousands of platforms that can help to improve visibility: interviews, videos, posts. Each filmmakers has at least a couple of channel where he can share his and others'people work. ""The main thing marketing needs to work is to be focused"" that's the damn reason why you see EMPTY independent filmmakers channel. This marketing you are talking about work for campaign with money and a team, things that an independent filmmaker usually doens't have. 
However, try to moderate your tone, ok? This is not how civil people are supposed to talk to each other. Go to talk to the wall otherwise. It will be more interested in your opinion than me."
Filmmakers,febxed4,t1_febq0y8,1578963861.0,"And you for sure understand marketing better than me. Right? 

>customers they already have
they do not have them, they need them and in order to have them they use promotion. 

Tell me the difference between festivals which needs exposure and so made a mutually beneficial deal and filmmakers which needs exposure and can potentially gain visibility from each other ( not to mention production and distribution -sharing my project with other filmmakers I found both of them but now we are talking mostly of visibility) tell me the difference please because I do not see it. Festivals need submissions and people who buy tickets? Filmmakers need distribution and (eventually) people who buy tickets. Great benefit could come from a proper, constant, mutual promotion.

Your point is different from mine? Very well but don't you dare to say I don't understand marketing. It's very unrespecteful."
Filmmakers,febvubb,t1_febo0yr,1578963350.0,"Apparently you all seem to agree to each other (I mean with the answers I read). I do believe that posts like mine help and that people just doing nothing and waiting for the distribution company or the production company to arrive, well, they don't help themselves and they do not help the others. I will answer to everyone but I will start with yours post: there are a lot of valuable independent films out there and valuable independent filmmakers, and yes, if each of them is going to post SYSTEMATICALLY about their project as well as the others' I do believe that that promotion doesn't need money; come on, every independent poject has a minimum of public attention, even a poor one, but it's there and 0.1% x 1000 would be already something. Would this change things? Not sure but it would be a try. The movie I used for this gif is a paradox of course because we are talking of millions of budget but the past and the human kind's hystory taught us that there is a great power in collaboration. Nowadays the problem is the lack of 2 things: perseverance and interest in others. If someone has a camera and a youtube channel it seems to be enough."
Filmmakers,febmax8,t1_feblppj,1578960329.0,"I do believe that the reason why they disappear so easily it's because of lack of promotion. As you said people, friends watching it (I am not even talking about reddit because here promotion is IMPOSSIBLE) and forgetting it because as filmmakers we do not promote each other in a systematic way. I promote you, you promote me. It should be like this for months. There would be a real wall against the marketing, money system of social media."
