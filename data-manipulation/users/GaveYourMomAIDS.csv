mildlyinfuriating,fg7mosu,t1_fg7mlkx,1580596245.0,How is the scrolling on the magic mouse different? Genuinely curious since I haven't had any kind of scrolling limitations with the mice I've used
mildlyinfuriating,fg7gk9j,t1_fg76dk0,1580591984.0,Look at the mouse called Maus by Lofree. They have side buttons that allow you to use gestures for MacOS. I personally love it
RedditsMuseumofFilth,fg5q4dx,t1_fg2tbau,1580534864.0,Also apparently the maggots here are too old to be the ones that they use. They use younger maggots I assume because they can eat more
facebookwins,fg5mpkd,t1_fg50dco,1580531781.0,It's a joke...
RedditsMuseumofFilth,fg18u3y,t1_fg13b0a,1580422881.0,Ikr? I'm not squeamish normally but this video actually made me feel so uncomfortable. He's also just sitting there as if he doesn't have a gaping hole on the back of his head filled with maggots. Ugh I hate it so much.
RedditsMuseumofFilth,fg18gg8,t1_fg184wo,1580422705.0,"Honestly, im not sure. It's a video of a dude sitting in a hospital with the back of his head like gone and thousands of maggots are crawling around inside eating his dead flesh. You can see parts of his skull and stuff. He's also just sitting there as if nothing is happening. Also, there are a shitload of maggots on the ground too that fell off of his head. Ugh I'm not squeamish at all, but this video actually made me feel uncomfortable"

RectalStickers,ffh7irr,t1_fffq3vx,1579925311.0,"I might be in the minority here (especially since this sub is specifically for these stickers) but I don't think people should put these stickers on other peoples' stuff. I can excuse putting them on some packaging for an item in a store because that doesn't cause any extra work for whoever buys it, but when people put these stickers on the actual product or, like in OPs case, on their air driers, its too much. I don't find it funny anymore when someone has to go out of their way to take it off. Not sure if others feel the same way, but just wanted to get it out there."
RectalStickers,ffh798z,t1_fffqdng,1579925087.0,"The fact that nail polish would easily remove it doesn't mean that it's not vandalism. Technically, putting the sticker on in the first place is vandalism but at least that doesn't require extra materials to take it off."
Pottery,ffh6gjw,t1_ffdh0s0,1579924431.0,Ooooh that makes sense! Thanks for the explanation (: the end result is super cool and I'm trying to think of other applications for it. Thanks again!

TikTokCringe,ff1q442,t1_ff1e6ck,1579483690.0,I doubt it tbh. It's the same thing with sense8. There have been so many petitions to get a third season to PROPERLY wrap it up but Netflix won't budge. So I feel like they'd act the same way about OA

2healthbars,feftahs,t1_fefrvh3,1579064539.0,"Ah gotcha. Yeah I agree that the idea isn't original or anything, but I do find it weird that two separate people would draw and post the exact same idea such a short time apart. Plus, idk if you saw the other one, but each panel is pretty much exactly the same on both comics too. Like the wording and everything. That's why I thought it was weird. If they both decided to draw it independently, then I would expect there to be some differences but the fact that they're hours apart and identical wording is what stood out"
2healthbars,fefr55e,t1_feflklt,1579062802.0,"The person you replied to isn't  saying that this comic doesn't fit. Theyre saying that the chances are pretty low for two unrelated comic artists to decide to draw the exact same comic (in different styles) within a few hours of each other. Even the text is pretty similar to one another. So it seems that someone copied someone else's idea to a T. And from other comments, it seems like this has been happening pretty often recently where someone will post a comic and a few hours later, an almost identical comic will come out but just in a different style of art."
happycryingdads,fdsxaou,t1_fdryitj,1578709144.0,It doesn't allow color blind people to see colors how normal people do. They're physically missing the cones in their eyes. So this does help differentiate colors that would normally look the same but i don't think it's as life changing as you think. Just don't want you to think that it's allowing them to see colors completely
happycryingdads,fdswozp,t1_fdsqzim,1578708922.0,"They aren't 100% a scam, but they definitely don't do as much as people think. There's no way for color blind people to actually see the colors. They're physically missing the cones in their eyes. But yeah, it does help differentiate the colors that would normally look the same. But I do think that a lot of the reactions aren't real. Not to say that they're all fake, but I would say that most aren't real."
AskReddit,fdr4mcb,t1_fdqkdz4,1578679412.0,"So I actually got two of those cards and I don't think that it's a person writing all of it. My name on the cards were definitely written by different people, but message itself was identical between the two cards. Like all of the curves and stuff were the same. However, you can tell that it was an actual pen that wrote it so I think they hand write the names and the address and stuff, but they use an automatic writing machine to write the actual message. They're still an awesome company, but just wanted to point out that it looks like the whole thing is handwritten when only the name and address are"
