I like the tarte eyeliner! It’s fairly long lasting (about 6 hours before smudging, but I wear glasses so that’s normal for me) and has a very nice creamy texture. Sorry to say, but I only have the bright pink one, so I can’t say anything about the brown/black one."

Cringetopia,fev2874,t1_fesvudt,1579392251.0,"I know arguing with you is going to be as effective as hitching a wagon to a pack of rats but humans are NOT obligate carnivores. Obligate carnivores (like cats and some snakes) get a certain nutrient that they can ONLY get from raw meat. They have to eat meat or they’ll die. Humans are not. Sure, a good source of certain nutrients for humans comes from meat, but we can get them from other places, too.  We are not ‘supposed to eat other animals.’ If we were, we would be obligate carnivores, and we aren’t. Don’t get all scientific here without actually knowing what you are talking about."
