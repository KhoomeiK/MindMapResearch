The umbrella of ""illegal"" for some reason really seems to resonate with people of a certain mentality when wanting to use it as an excuse to dehumanize. 

A person shoot unnecessarily by police, will cause outrage but a person who refused or doesn't follow police commands instantly (cue resisting arrest memes) seem to be more than enough to say ""Oh well, maybe if he'd listen he wouldn't have been shot"" for at least 50% of the people understanding the situation.

> Signs and symptoms, as outlined by the DSM-5, include a marked incongruence between experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least six months duration, as manifested by at least six of the following (one of which must be criterion A1):

I read what you presented which was a list of symptoms. My understanding is that they look at a series of symptoms over a course of 6 months to draw an assumption, which I would imagine entails additional investigation. Kind of like ""if the cough persists for more than 2 weeks, see a doctor"" type shit.  So you can't look at the kiddo playing with dolls for 6 months and say ""HEY!!! He wants to be a girl"" the same way you wouldn't assume someone has lung cancer because they have a cough.

Kids are actively working on out their roles in the world. My son was 9 when he asked me how he would know if he liked girls or boys. As a parent, if my son, now an adult, shared with me he was uncomfortable in his own skin and/or feels like he's in the wrong body, then I'd be by his side while we explored that. If he felt the need to transition then I'd support him. He's mine child FFS.
