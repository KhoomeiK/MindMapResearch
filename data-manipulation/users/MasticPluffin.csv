I'm all for being kind and not bullying people for their looks or size, but that number is just... it makes me very worried. And it has nothing to do with looks. We're not that big over here yet, but that's where we are heading."
fatlogic,fflmk4a,t3_eu56t3,1580041408.0,"I mean, I eat chocolate in front of the TV sometimes, but I also go to the gym and eat actual food in reasonable amounts the rest of the time. (Edit: But I still don't have a sixpack, lol. I'll have to put in some more work for that.) 

No one will get a sixpack if all they do is lay on the couch and eat. I understand that people struggle to get fit if they believe that's how it works, though."
fatlogic,fflei2h,t1_ffihmdx,1580038612.0,"Yeah, I had a Facebook friend who was like that, vegan but would eat meat ""sometimes"". She would constantly ask me (vegetarian for 10+ years then) if food I posted about was vegan. She was the most obnoxious vegan ever, but it only lasted for a month. Thank God. She went LCHF after that, and basically ate only eggs and meat.

We're not friends IRL, lol."
fatlogic,ffldlas,t1_ffjbb7c,1580038264.0,Haha! That made me snort. Good thing I finished my coffee before reading this.

fatlogic,ffhu9k4,t1_ff3oc3d,1579954191.0,"Late reply, but same. I'm well within a normal BMI but people still seem worried. I know I don't need to lose more (and I'm bot trying to atm), but the truth is that I'm at a healthier weight/body composition now than when I started. If it's concern trolling to worry about people being overweight, this is too."
fatlogic,ffhtyyd,t1_ffc8c2r,1579953778.0,"Yes, that's true. They are usually much more negative and don't even consider exercise having any positive effect at all. Almost feels refreshing in comparison."
fatlogic,ffbqr7f,t3_esos5i,1579778954.0,"Isn't exercise shown to actually be good for your mental health, though? 

Reading about things like that is what motivated me to start working out regularly. Sure, I didn't exactly love it the first time, or the second, but I honestly do love my workouts now. I agree with some of what OP is saying, like you should find something that you like and can keep doing consistently, but pushing yourself is kind of... the point, isn't it? Of course you shouldn't push yourself too much, but enough to, you know, improve at your own pace. Your goal could be to just feel better, mentally and physically. You don't have strive for elite athlete levels of fitness"
fatlogic,ffbp7hc,t3_ermqnt,1579776799.0,"Skinny people are hailed as stylish no matter what they wear? Ha! I beg to differ.

My father is skinny af (he's like 6'1 and only weighs a couple of kilos more than me, 5'8 - 5'9 ish with a BMI of 21... yeah.) and a classmate once asked me why he looks like a hobo when he has quite a bit of money. I wasn't mad, because he kind of does look like a hobo sometimes."
fatlogic,ff9m3bj,t1_ff5q9jl,1579715858.0,"I'm  usually around a size European size 36 (UK 8 I think), so that explains my confusion over sizing in Primark. I honestly don't get vanity sizing, though. Wouldn't it be less confusing just having the correct sizes, but just add on a few larger ones? I mean, if everyone knows the sizes run large everyone will know they're not truly that size."
fatlogic,ff3oevw,t3_er3kr1,1579545397.0,"Exercise might not fix everything  but it fixes a lot of things. It's not stupid or a punishment; to me exercise is self care. And yes, exercise is definitely good for you."
fatlogic,ff3ntcc,t3_er6wz7,1579545026.0,I don't think anyone who only gets in enough activity to have slightly elevated breathing for 20 minutes a day *needs* 3500 calories. Wow.
fatlogic,ff3lvio,t1_ff2zngm,1579543823.0,"Was just going to say this. It's already normalized. A lot of people even seem to think normal weight and somewhat athletic is ""anorexic"".

Btw, sizing in the UK did really threw me for a loop when I went there this summer. A Primark XXS was too big for me. Like quite a bit too big. XXS was way too small even when I was an underweight teenager...! But I guess their sizing could be wonky because it's not... the best quality shop, lol."
AmItheAsshole,feov0g4,t1_feof5tw,1579306011.0,"I have broad shoulders too and I'm actually surprised that it could be offensive. I mean, I like my shoulders and think they look good, lol, but I also don't have a masculine body at all. Maybe that's why don't put the two together.

AmItheAsshole,femfk4n,t1_femd10m,1579252876.0,"I commented about the language thing in a different thread, but this definitely makes them the assholes. Of course they won't be able to to talk to an American if they're not in America!

BTW, when in Germany I was able to communicate with a receptionist at a hostel who only spoke broken German, no English. I don't speak German except for a handful of words. It wasn't easy, but it worked because we both tried our best."
AmItheAsshole,femfbev,t1_fembrok,1579252517.0,"Having guests pay for their meal, or pay part of that cost, is actually a thing where I live. Far from everyone here thinks it's reasonable, but the majority of weddings I've been have been like this. I personally think it's weird, but I never complain.

I should add that having catering etc is very expensive here due to cost of food and labour, so that probably has something to do with it.

NTA, btw. Sure, your parents have the right to feel disappointed, but it's your wedding. I would say no assholes if they just mentioned being disappointed, but what you said about your suggestion not being enough makes me think they're kind of asshole-y. 

The language thing is not a good reason imo. English is not my native tongue which means that I don't always get to communicate in my own language. This is the norm for most people. I don't see a problem if the ceremony is  both in English and the other language in question. I don't know what country you're going to, but generally most non-native speakers speak or understand at least a little bit of English (with some exceptions, of course)."
fatlogic,fegvvsm,t3_ep2e84,1579103705.0,"Keep the pets out of this, FFS. 

Pets deserve owners who take good care of them. Letting your cat get so fat that it can't groom itself is NOT taking good care of it. These people don't deserve pets. Poor cat!"
fatlogic,feg2jdi,t1_fedj3j1,1579074114.0,"I also stopped studying art, partly for the reason you mentioned, but also because I just couldn't handle the pretentiousness. It was mostly the students who were pretentious, though, not the teachers. 

My favorite model was actually an older woman. We had one who was in her 70s or 80s (this was 10 years ago, so I can't remember exactly) and she was just amazing. She held poses just as well as the younger models."

fatlogic,fe6zjz4,t1_fe5t38b,1578908156.0,"This. Imagine thinking that you making demands on how the art others create should look is actually reasonable.

The art I create is for me. I draw and paint because it makes me feel good, and what I create is an expression of me, my imagination and my personal aesthetic. Demanding I change my art is incredibly entitled and *rude* af, unless you're re actually *paying* for a commission. And even then, there's a limit on what demands you can make.

If you want more fat positive art, draw it yourself. Maybe these people would understand how much work is put into art if they did.

BTW, it's not like fat, chubby or curvy bodies are unusual in art. I mean, when I was in art school the vast majority of the nude models we drew were overweight or obese! (I definitely appreciated getting to draw a variety of body shapes and sizes, but I wish we would have gotten a more muscular and fit model at least once. That would have been great for studying the anatomy of the muscles!) And those models were the most popular ones because of that. They would probably still fall into the smallfat category according to most FA's, though."
fatlogic,fe19w4m,t1_fe0dg2d,1578824198.0,"Same here! I'm a 30 D (Used to be a 32DD before I lost weight and started working out) and quite tall, so they don't look big at all, just... I don't know, medium sized and in proportion with everything else, I guess. It's like people imagine huge Pamela Anderson boobs when they hear D or DD."
AmItheAsshole,fdyguh2,t3_encz3g,1578779611.0,"Maybe an unpopular opinion, but YTA. Not now, though, because you were able to change your mind and listen to your wife and other medical professionals. I think admitting that your were wrong and trying your best to support and understand your son and his difficulties makes up for it. You do seem like a good and very caring parent, and I understand feeling hesitant with all the misinformation that's out there regarding stimulants. I think you did what you did out of love, so it's not the intent that is asshole-y.

I should mention that I got diagnosed with ADHD (predominantly inattentive, plus ""autistic traits"") around my mid twenties, meaning I went through my entire childhood without meds. That wasn't fun, and I wish I could have been diagnosed and medicated much earlier.

Btw, you should check out How to ADHD on YouTube if you haven't already. She has lots of videos that both you and your son could watch.

PS. Don't be too hard on yourself! Don't dwell on this, but move forward and focus on what's going on now instead. I said it earlier, but you do seem like a good parent. You and your son having such a good relationship is going to help your son so, so much."
fatlogic,fduvfct,t3_en29tf,1578739469.0,"I mean, sure, my body still looks different than it did when I was 16 (more muscle and boobs mostly lol) but my waist measurement is only 2 cm (a little less than an inch I think) bigger than it was back then. I'm 30, BTW.

I was slightly underweight at 16, though, whereas my current BMI is somewhere between 20 and 21.

I mean, she kind of has a point, but she also oversimplifying. Your body will probably change a lot between your teens and, say, your thirties, but you are not doomed to be fat."
fatlogic,fdrjuz6,t3_emta6s,1578685576.0,"I wasn't allowed sweets other than a limited amount on Saturdays. Soft drinks were allowed during the weekend, also in a limited amount. I didn't cause any sort of disordered eating or problematic relationship to food, but I think it had something to do with my good dental health."
fatlogic,fdraz31,t1_fdqv1uv,1578681951.0,"Same, but my problem is dresses with a cinched waist. The waist of the dress ends up way above my actual waist and that looks really stupid. Like I'm wearing a child's clothes that just happen to fit width-wise. If I size up it's too big everywhere else. 

I'm sure it's hard to find clothes for people who need a very big size, but they're definitely not the only ones who struggle with that. A lot of us who wear straight sizes have more unusual proportions. Sometimes it's possible to make things work, other times not so much."

How could you struggle with getting your long hair shorter? I just don't understand. I mean, sure, my hair grows like crazy and it's really annoying having to get my fringe trimmed all the time, *but it's not hard*. (Well, it is hard for me to cut it myself and get it somewhat good looking, but my hairdresser offers a free fringe trim in between haircuts.)

Whatever, I'm getting a little sidetracked. This analogy is stupid."
fatlogic,fdb4j0b,t3_ekgr6e,1578253704.0,"What societal benefits? That people give me backhanded compliments or weird comments about it? That people get annoyed, upset or offended when I talk about working out, despite them *asking about it* or commenting on how my body has changed (often in a quite rude manner)? 

Not that everyone is like that. Most people just don't care, tbh. I've never really gotten any cheers or compliments, other than from other people who are working out.

Nope, I do it for my health, mostly. And because I actually *like* working out."
fatlogic,fdauzjv,t3_ek89rs,1578250539.0,"Umm, if the video is about taking in the waist on a pair of jeans I doubt that the girl in the picture is altering a plus size. She'd have to take in a lot more than the waist if she was...

The video would be very useful for people like me, who have bigger butts and thighs but a smaller waist. Jeans either fit at the waist with the rest being uncomfortably or ridiculously tight, or too big in the waist and perfect on the butt and thighs. 

Altering clothes is not fatphobic at all. Especially if you can't find stuff that fits in the first place."
fatlogic,fda61ra,t3_ekegof,1578242189.0,"How is she too thin? She doesn't look underweight on any of the pictures, so it must be esthetics then...? (Unless people have no idea what underweight vs normal weight actually looks like, which unfortunately is very likely) How is that not body shaming?

Sure, she looks very different, both her body and her face, but that's what happens when you lose a lot of weight and/or build muscle and lose fat. I only lost 2-3 kilos since I started working out, but my jawline is sharper, my cheeks smaller and I've gone down a size or two. Adele must have lost a lot more, so the difference is bigger for her. 

IMO, she looked good before and still looks good now, but she seems to be a lot more invested in her health now. That's good for her, and anyone getting offended by that is just too sensitive. It's her body, dammit."
fatlogic,fcmsyz8,t3_ei0j84,1577790759.0,"Maybe that photo wasn't meant to help you. 

Lots of girls, especially teens, feel insecure about those skin rolls and hate their bodies for it. (I know I did) Isn't it a good thing if influencers are trying to help them? But I guess according to FAs thin people can't have any real problems.
