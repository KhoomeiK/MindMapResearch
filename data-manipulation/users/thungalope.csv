relationship_advice,fgk97lh,t1_fgk5gba,1580860228.0,"Definitely. She clearly hates that this is happening but is just guarded. We are just two peas in a pod when she’s feeling up - interests, jokes, and all the other little stuff that makes spending time with her the best time on earth. However when she’s down, she just shuts everything out. But even in her down phase she was very honest. She wants it to work. I just don’t think she has as much hope as I do."
relationship_advice,fgjy8xe,t1_fgjxjg9,1580853739.0,I started. But i need to be honest with my therapist with how much it matters to me. Thanks for the help.
relationship_advice,fgjtep7,t1_fgjslxa,1580851035.0,"Yeah, working out hasn't seemed like a super important thing to her, but I'm sure she'd give it a go. Don't really think that's my place to suggest haha but thank you."
relationship_advice,fgjt1h5,t1_fgjr03r,1580850831.0,"I worry that there won't be a future. That's why I'm trying to stay in her life even just a bit - she's not like off-the-walls crazy or anything like that. I empathize entirely - I have depression + anxiety and I too go to therapy.   


I just wonder if completely disconnecting is the right answer. We're way too good for each-other and compliment one another in the best ways. Then one little episode happens and all the sudden she can't handle it. Is it truly worth it to risk losing everything? Or is there an advantage to pulling away that I wouldn't have if I remained friends? Truly the biggest heartbreak I could imagine. Her emotions I can handle if we ended up figuring it out - it's my own that I'm afraid of if we cut contact entirely."

I kept trying to get her to slow down and she kept apologizing profusely but she kept going. Like we’re taking every 7-10 minutes or so. I went to the bathroom at one point and came out to witness her getting into it with another patron, at which case I decided to cut my losses. I convinced her outside for a cigarette (glad those days are over - half a month strong!) and she immediately started bawling crying in the street. I had to put her in an Uber home and she was so upset and begged for a second date. She didn’t get blackout this time, but after I texted her a while later that I wasnt interested in pursuing a relationship, she sent me pages of texts telling me I was an asshole and didn’t give her a chance. Yeah, glad I didn’t, too."
