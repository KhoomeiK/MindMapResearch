asktrees,fehqg1n,t1_fehpg48,1579121824.0,"Ohhhhh. I thought I was taking it out to stop the burning, but yes, that would make sense to just use the cover instead. Wow, we were just doing it all wrong."
Healthyhooha,fehepuq,t3_ep5e60,1579115012.0,"I looked up its packaging instructions: “For the first cycle of use only, use an additional form of non-hormonal birth control (such as condoms, spermicide) for the first 7 days to prevent pregnancy until the medication has enough time to work. If you start on the first day of your period, you do not need to use back-up birth control the first week.”

From a pregnancy prevention standpoint, if you are comfortable that you are taking it perfectly and are comfortable with its effectiveness for perfect use, then yes, it is ok. But only you can decide those things."
asktrees,fegv1ob,t1_fegboh9,1579103171.0,"I figured it out (have to push the bowl in really, really well so it gets caught under the lip of the downstem).

Here’s what it looks like right. [https://imgur.com/a/xd6UjmP](https://imgur.com/a/xd6UjmP)"
asktrees,fegu172,t1_fegejgf,1579102520.0,"I do not 100% know what that means. It does have a carb hole, but the way my friend taught me was that you take the downstem out once you’re ready to inhale. 

I did figure out the issue. The downstem has a little lip to hold the bowl. You’ve got to really, really push the bowl in to get it under the lip. I guess I’ve been high as hell for the months I’ve owned this to never notice before."

IsThisHPV,feco0ho,t3_el3kjm,1578978753.0,"This looks like tinea versicolor to me. (Note: not a doctor.) If it is, an anti fungal cream (such as Lotrimin) will clear it up."
WomensHealth,fec9o48,t3_eob8rq,1578969138.0,"I used to shave but my skin (all over) is very sensitive, so this just caused issues. I was doing professional waxing until I started to get a lot of ingrown hair, which would then cause scarring. I’ve since had laser hair removal."
WomensHealth,fec8gsa,t3_eo7agf,1578968482.0,There has been some research suggesting that wearing a bra actually causes the pectoral muscles to atrophy.
WomensHealth,fdf0e8m,t1_fdezbod,1578350483.0,"I’ve never received healthcare anywhere else, so I don’t have a frame of reference, but I have tons of stories of how it has failed me. The most recent is that I changed insurance (had to temporarily medically retire myself due to chronic illness) so I had to switch to my husband’s insurance. My psychiatrist is not covered under new insurance. The new insurance only covers psychiatrists operating under a particular hospital network. When I called in December to make an appointment, they were booking in February. So, my only covered option for psychiatric care is booking out longer than the amount of time I can receive my psych meds without seeing a psychiatrist. So that’s fun."
WomensHealth,fdewldr,t3_eksd5j,1578348113.0,"I’m in the US, so I don’t have any help for what resources are available for you, but I just want to support and affirm you for trying to seek medical care. My mom used to do this to me, so I just want you to know it’s not right and it’s not okay. Keep fighting for yourself! You are strong and brave."

Healthyhooha,fd0fi1k,t3_ej6qoq,1578118059.0,"You could use barrier protection. There’s lots of ways for two women to have sex together, so I’ll just throw out some examples: dental dams for oral sex, using condoms on any toys (including external toys like Hitachi wands or other vibrators), gloves for fingering. You just have to remember that the point of barrier protection is to keep the bodily fluids off the other partner, so once your fluids are on the barrier, the “wet” part should only touch you. (I know that seems obvious, but just in case.)"
Healthyhooha,fd0d3bm,t3_ejr6v8,1578117113.0,"You could also try a product like Vagisil’s itch cream. I used this in the past for dry, itchy vulva skin. My skin (all over) is stupid sensitive and this was before I knew I was allergic to most clothes detergents."
Healthyhooha,fd0cf1h,t1_fd0bpli,1578116840.0,"Doctors deal with all manner of bodily fluids, so they shouldn’t be bothered by this. Depending on your flow, they might place something similar to a puppy pad under you and have you wipe down with something like a wet wipe first. 

You could always call the office and ask to speak to a nurse. That way you can ask ahead of time what they want you to do. For example, if they need to do internal swabs, it might be best not to be wearing any internal menstrual products."
Healthyhooha,fd0broi,t3_ejr5f7,1578116581.0,Wine contains both yeast and sugar (which feeds yeast).
Healthyhooha,fd0bm3u,t3_ejr6v8,1578116519.0,A doctor can still examine your vaginal area while you’re menstruating.
Healthyhooha,fd0b7w3,t3_ejrbga,1578116355.0,"My understanding is the only risk is the potential delay of correct diagnosis and treatment if you don’t, in fact, have a YI. Once you’ve had a YI though, you’re likely pretty able to recognize future ones."
aww,fd0a6p9,t1_fczp60i,1578115915.0,"I don’t know either, but this whole thread has been an interesting experience. I never realized my “I want a lady to love me like this dog loves her” comment would bloom into such a *thing*. And I have no idea why one of my comments was removed, another appears to be hidden from everyone but me, etc."

ChoosingBeggars,fcyv6yr,t1_fcyfq3y,1578087787.0,Plenty of places use some fuzzy math to try to subvert this.
ChoosingBeggars,fcytcu8,t1_fcxq6a0,1578086652.0,"I always leave a tip, minimum $5. If the service was so bad that some might think they don’t  “deserve” a tip, I’ll take that up with the manager (and they’ll either comp part of the meal or give me a coupon). The reason I do this is that waitstaff can legally be paid less than minimum wage. (There is a separate minimum wage called a tipped minimum wage. Where I live, that’s $2.13/hr, as opposed to the $7.25/hr general minimum wage.) By always leaving at least $5, I increase the chances they’ll make at least actual minimum wage for the hour that included me being there. 

Plus, add onto this that many servers have to “tip out” the house a portion of all the receipts rung under their name and it’s entirely possible this poor server *had to pay* for the misfortune of serving this miserable woman.

Edit: grammar"
aww,fcyocrj,t1_fcwxa8f,1578083823.0,"This thread has been a wild ride of people assuming I’m a single basement-dwelling dudebro, when in fact I’m a married woman with an “I don’t have a girlfriend but I do know a girl who would be mad if she heard me say that.”

I wasn’t lamenting that no one will love me, just that dang dogs love so hard but our time with them is so short."

aww,fcxywof,t1_fcwxh96,1578072443.0,"That’s what got me about it, not that humans don’t love that way, but that dogs are so pure and yet our time with them is limited."
