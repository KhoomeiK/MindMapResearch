We could just as well argue that steak is better than noodles because it's more nutrient dense. However, a poor college student living on just steak would starve in a month due to the unsustainable costs for him.

That isn't the point, and you're making the fallacy even more clear.

If the basis of the statement were debating was ""Which food is more nutritious and provides better nutrition outcome"" then the answer is steak regardless of how much it costs. 

You're admitting based on your argument that my premise is correct; that the care is better in private care but the cost is a barrier to entry.

This is the crux of my argument, when you say ""the outcome is better"" you're implying that the care you receive is better when its **as you've admitted, it is not better care**.

The discussion regarding access to care is the whole crux of the argument regarding private/public care and is irrelevant in this current discussion.

My point completely is solely that the care in private systems **is better** and that saying that there is barriers to receiving that care doesn't make that less true.

You're literally missing the forest for the trees on this one, and you keep deflecting back to the core moral issue of the debate between private and public care; and frankly and directly that was not the discussion I intended to have and was one that I distinctly tried to avoid.

The fact that people are unable to separate this fact from the discussion regarding policy truly bothers me because its a very important part of the consideration and discussion tbh.

To sum up:  

**Your argument is totally fine and appropriate for a discussion regarding private/public care and which we should implement regarding policy, however when discussing my actual point it is irrelevant.

Irrelevant.

All I was doing was showing that private care is more effective when you go through the system and that its a common fallacy for proponents of public healthcare to make the statement ""Public has better outcome"" when its misleading because the studies used to substantiate the argument include cost of access as part of the study to denigrate the private care.

As I said, my position on public/private in this specific instance are irrelevant and if the matter is going to be discussed its important to have a basis of facts."

This is not a very good analogy.  No one disputes that private care is expensive and it wasn't my point.   You're missing the forest for the trees on this one.  I never said it wasn't expensive and I never said that I wouldn't support reform. 

Also; even if that restaurant existed if you were assessing ""customer happiness"" aka ""medical outcome"" you wouldn't survey a bunch of people that never ate at your restaurant.  You would only survey those that had eaten.

its the same thing. 

>You say it's not a better outcome

The quote wasn't my statement.

Private care has better outcome.

>But it honestly depends on how you measure it. It would be like saying the US economy is the best because it allows the richest people in the world. But at the same time, it has a lower GDP per person than Iceland.

Right, the problem isn't that people are using actual factual data to report on the effectiveness of care within private systems.

They are using the cost of entry to say that the outcome of care in that country is worse and it makes no sense to me and I don't accept it. Frankly, I live in a nation with public healthcare and I asked my GP this question and he agrees.  To assess outcome of healthcare, the people being studied must go through the healthcare system. 

If you're assessing the outcome of healthcare on the patients it treats, by the very nature of what you're assessing you must be treated by healthcare.

Again; I don't want to get into the private/public discussion as i've already admitted that this issue is the moral crux and its going to get out of hand.

I just don't think that its acceptable for proponents of public care to use studies to say that it has better outcome that reduce the score of the private care because of the inability of some people to pay for healthcare.

I find that its a misleading and dishonest statistic/study sleight of hand that doesn't show the actual facts.

I find this dishonest and misleading.

Its like including people who didn't try your food in a survey.

I understand that this is the **core moral issue** when it comes to public/private and frankly it stands plenty strong on its own.

We don't need to include false twisting of statistics to use studies that show that public care ""has a better outcome"" but in reality uses the fact that people can't access the healthcare system due to cost to lower that outcome and result which to me is dishonest.

This is poor example but you see my point.  This is cherry picked data that excludes very important data to contextualize the point.  

This is propaganda.

This doesn't actually tackle school quality, its actually tackling culture and racial differences in how families raise their children.

Its the core of my position tbh and it actually adds weight to my position.  White families have more of an interest in seeing their children succeed scholastically and spend more time teaching their children basic educational information before they hit the school system. This is supported by the data you linked.

Yes, some of this may have something to do with the fact that white people earn more money etc etc; however I think it has a LOT more to do with the fatherless household issue within black communities and a lack of a focus on the black culture on raising strong children and strong families.
>""Black people face racial bias to this day."" -- Implicit racial bias remains widespread, even among individuals who explicitly reject prejudice.

Great. So even among those that explicitly reject prejudice it still exists.

Therefor its not something that we can adjust for and we are literally ghost hunting.

If even those who are explicitly and willfully attempt to act in a way that is not prejudice and biased, and STILL act in that way; then its literal ghost hunting.

> Home appreciation was a huge element of them being poorer, that's no small thing.

You can argue that the banks have had racist or prejudice lending practices and I won't disagree with you; however I don't think that you can use prices that are determined by the market to imply racism when the fact is that most of these communities have unfortunately been destroyed by the actions of the very people who live in them.

The black families that purchased homes in areas that were not destroyed by crime and poverty, i'm sure did extremely well on their home values.

The black families that purchased homes in areas that were destroyed by crime and poverty, only have their own people to blame IMHO and the black culture IMHO needs to be extremely critical regarding crime and they are **not**

>Sure. And here.

First source behind a paywall, immediately dismissed.

Reading the second source which goes on to great lengths but I can summarize the argument which is implicit racial bias in the medical system.  As I said unless you're capable of showing me legitimate policies, actions, people, or situations which are racially biased (such as affirmative action) all we are doing is ghost hunting and trying to use implicit unintentional bias/prejudice to try to argue for actual active racist policies.

The fact is that if these doctors are doing this unintentionally and without malice, then we need to understand the base source of why its happening and try to figure out why.  We can't use these as a reason why we need to implement another racist policy in order to magically make things right by discriminating against others. 

>Well, no one's saying race should be the only factor. But given its such a large factor in discrimination, it can't be ignored.

No, it absolutely can be ignored. There is no reason to consider someones race in determining how they were discriminated against.  Do you know how unbelievably insulting it is to tell a 20 year old kid that he can't get into university because we need to give his position to a less qualified black person because of unconscious implicit prejudice and bias that people are not even willfully doing?

Its absurd and it is insulting.

How would you want to be that black person who gets told that they wouldn't have made it into the university based on merit alone, but only got in because of a step stool?  

What if they are not told and that question lingers?

That is the issue I see here.  Judge someone on their merits, not on their skin color.  Frankly; I say strip away all the identification stuff and judge them based on an application #. 

>""Well yeah, I can use a hammer, a little worse than John can when John's had private carpentry lessons"", then its clearly in my interest as the carpentry teacher to take the kid with far more potential rather than the one who got a better result, but without that advantage would've done far worse.

No its not. 

Its in your best interests to produce the best end result of the school.  

You haven't demonstrated ""more potential"" all that you've demonstrated is that you're a shittier carpenter at the time of application.

The teacher/master doesn't care that the pupil had a rough childhood, all he cares about is the quality of the applicant applying. The merit and skill of the person applying.

When your argument is ""well, he had additional training and he is better at the task he is applying for""

THEN HE SHOULD GET THE POSITION

and to argue ""well, he is white so I should get it because of inherent racial bias"" is by definition racist as all hell.

>I mean, that's just a fallacious strawman in and of itself. That's not my position, an equal mix of races isn't required. What is required is taking into account that black people are disadvantaged, **as has been proven**, and using that to adjust scores so that talent isn't lost in favour of preserving the power of the privileged.

You haven't proven fuckin anything.  Black people are disadvantaged because they mostly live in broken households, in crime and poverty ridden areas, with a shitty culture that doesn't outwardly shame crime and instead embraces it.  That isn't inherent racism, its bad culture and families.  Fix that, and your problems go away.

>I'm afraid this has been proven. They face medical discrimination. They face discrimination in education, in the workplace and in general, all sourced above. The evidence we have is clear.

No, I absolutely completely disagree.  I don't care about ""implicit hidden bias"" or ""they have a slower response time to patients"" bullshit.

Show me laws, show me policies, show me actionable events that are racist or prejudice with things that we can change and i'll address them.

Its racist as all hell in an active manner to discriminate against white people by lowering their scores.

Its racist as all hell in an active manner to discriminate in favor of black people by raising their scores.

Fix the underlying issues, don't play these sort of bullshit games. You wanna fix the schools? fix the schools. You don't get to implement a totally racist race based policy and then pretend like its okay.

>Yet, you're happy to allow a system that discriminates based on skin color up to the very college gates,

Fuck you, not once did I say that and to make that assertion is insulting.

Take some self consideration as well and realize that most of the problems of the black community are caused by the black community. Stop blaming it on whitey and start focusing inward on how you can improve things.

>To allow talent to be lost out on because of results that, the evidence clearly shows, were biased?

Getting them into university when they are unqualified doesn't fix anything. it makes things worse because the more skilled person is not attending and the less qualified person is and will likely flunk out.

> It seems like you already do support a system where those who deserve to enter the school based upon their merits aren't allowed to, in favour of those who enter a school due to their privilege.

No, when someone is assessed based on their skills at the time of applying based on testing and skills; that is absolutely based on their merit.

>If you only beat out your opponent because you were more advantaged in life, you didn't really get in on your merits.

If I studied my fucking ass off and graduated a 8 year medical degree and you told me that I didn't get in on my merits, and I only got in because I was white i'd punch you right in the fucking mouth.

Also; how are you going to look a black man in the face that got in based on AA and tell him he got in based on his merits?  He only got in because of his black man boost."

Saying that Irish, Asians, and other minorities have suceeded when extremely poor and also discrminated against on a serious level shows that racism is not the factor and is instead cultural/racial (as in black oriented) as opposed to inherent racism.

Unless you want to make the argument that black slaves had it worse then irish indentured slaves or asian slaves/workers.

All 3 had horrible levels of discrimination, racism, and abuse that is comparable albeit all 3 are disgusting for different reasons.

Recognizing differences between the races that are fundamental like that is **not racist** in the slightest, nor is locking someone up who is violent because of in innate higher testosterone.

4) You'd have to make the case that the schools are poorly funded because they want to deprive the funding to black people; when its more then likely because school funding is determined due to municipal and local taxes, which means that the poorest areas have the poorest schools.

Sending police to areas with more crime is not racist.

How well off were any other immigrants that came over from the old world with nothing in their hands?  How well off were the irish indentured servants that came over as slaves as well?

Yes, I would and have agreed with this. The generational wealth argument is one that does have some merit to it albeit with a bit of an asterix as many immigrants came over with just as little wealth and thrived.

>It would lead me to predict that blacks would still be much poorer on average.

As I said elsewhere the existence of other immigrants in similar situations thriving does dispute your point substantially however.

This supports my point that the proper way to tackle this issue is to improve base public education and to improve the culture/family of minorities in order to encourage a stronger family unit and a stronger focus on generational wealth/success.

This goes back to my first point in my initial reply.

Why are they over and under represented? why is this seen as a bad thing and not just the natural result of the current education crop?  Is there any evidence to support a belief that the races should be balanced across the education system?

We all know a lot of the education system comes from economic backgrounds, social backgrounds, and cultural influences; why are we pretending that it should be an equal split across the races and drawing the conclusion that its **racism** in the admissions process when its likely significantly more basic issues such as access to quality primary education, food, and time spent in a two parent household?

why is it automatically systemic racism holding back the minorities and ultimately lying at the feet of white people?

2) I think that just because its based on race doesn't inherently make it racist, however affirmative action given that it discriminates in favor of minorites at expense of whites based solely upon their skin color **is distinctly racist**

3) you could make an argument that the application to college should be stripped of identifying details to ensure that racism/bias has no application; however I don't think the result would be a more equal distribution of races among the students.  I actually support this as it doesn't discriminate against anyone.

>So we stop funding schools based on performance. (Oh you're doing a poor job so we're going to cut your funds makes perfect sense as they teach from history books published in 1960)

Yes, I support the discussion regarding improving public education (im personally against public education and prefer private with waivers for those in poverty).

>An obviously there could be rather simple steps taken to deal with racist administration....

Anyone who is actively and provably racist can already be dismissed from their positions as a violation of civil rights laws."
unpopularopinion,ff5ijkp,t1_ff5hyvh,1579594480.0,"> I misspoke. I'm not sure if it's the intention, but it doesn't fix racism though it's effect seeks to balance the affect of racism.

This operates on the fallacy that an unbalanced entrance percentage of races is inherently racist and a cause of racist policies as opposed to just the nature of the educate system at the moment by random nature.

>For example people will say black people being racist against white people is a huge problem. We shouldn't focus on racism against blacks. For fairness we should focus on racism against all.

Agreed, which is why i'm against AA because it swings the other way into revenge racism imho as opposed to trying to eliminate racism.

Eliminating racism would be to say, remove names and everything and only judge someone based on their merits without identifying details.

Revenge racism is reducing white/asian scores to compensate for ""past injustices"".

>Now obviously today and 200 years ago are far extremes, but then the argument boils down to where do you draw the line on how bad racism from minorities is. That is purely subjective and not a good subject for arguing.

No one even brought up minority racism, and its kinda avoiding the point which is that to reduce scores or entrance numbers based upon skin color is fundamentally racist and takes us a step backwards even if its intentions are meritorious.

>In an easier, but little different analogy that's like men arguing to a woman that rape laws need more equality and that women get away with it completely if not getting a much smaller sentence

Right, but men are not advocating that women who ARE convicted receive a stronger sentence, or that men who are convicted should receive a lesser sentence because women are not being convicted properly.

This is actually a great example because in the case of AA, they have distinctly included quotas where they are forced to convict a number of women for rape in order to balance the supposed sexism in the system, as opposed to address the fundamental issues about why women are not getting convicted as much.

Its the same thing as going on with AA, they don't try to address the underlying issues about why less minorities are getting into university, and instead want to merely mandate that more minorities go to university even if they are unqualified."

So then you admit that its the quality of their schooling and their municipality not inherent racism in the system that is the issue.  Good.

>
Sure, its unfortunate that poor students are disadvantaged at all. However, we know that the issue affects black students far, far worse than white students.

I'd like to see evidence that ""the issue"" affects black students far far far worse then white students.

Show me evidence that poor black students are disadvantages compared to poor white students when it comes to entrance exams.  Be specific because you made a specific point.  A general ""black people are admitted less then whites"" is not good enough to substantiate your point. 

I'd love to see you try to substantiate this specific argument. 

I don't think that you can.

The issue is access to basic education and a strong family and culture based around education/improvement.  It isn't inherent racism.

>Not at all. Racism has left black families poorer, medically discriminated against and with access to worse facilities. That leads to them being disadvantaged.

I'll sightly accept this as i've said elsewhere that coming from slavery has impacted their ability to compete with generational wealth, however this is only a slight acceptance as many immigrants suffered in the same situation and were very capable of thriving.

The main argument for me is that this is a funding for urban schools and a cultural issue and not a white/black racism issue.

How are black people medically discriminated against?  You gotta prove your case on this one.

>Because otherwise, they're losing access to talented kids whose grades are just lower because of outside influences.

You don't get to say that you're just as talented but have significantly worse scholastic achievements,  its not true at all. I know the argument you're trying to make which is ""if they had access they'd be just as good"" but they don't at the time of acceptance which is why its racist to adjust it based upon skin color.

You don't get to make the past tense argument that if they had access they'd be just as good, because they are applying to join now based on the skills they do have and not the ones they should have. 

Its like if someone applies to become a carpenter and the person handing admission goes ""can you use a hammer?"" and the person responds with ""no but due to institutional racism, i never had access to a hammer"".  The person isn't going to care because you're not qualified, even if he understands.

This goes back to the crux of my issue which is that were trying to fix something caused by an underlying issue by trying to adjust the end result with a racist policy.

Fix the poor education and the poor culture, and you'd fix the education problem.

Its also based upon a fallacy that university/college education should be an equal flat mix of all races, otherwise there is inherent racism.  I don't believe that to be the case.

>These people are already penalized for their skin colour.

No,  I don't agree what so ever that people applying to college are being penalized for their skin color.  They are being penalized for their socioeconomic access to education, which is why I don't think its a race based issue and advocate for better funding.

At the end of the day, if you work twice as hard as someone else but don't get access to the education you need to perform that is a travesty and i'm happy to combat the underlying cause of that; but I will **never** support a policy that discriminates based on skin color at the point of higher education acceptance when someone is already much more educated and deserves to enter the school based upon their merits.

So at its core; I agree that the school system could use some more work and I believe that culture is an important factor too, but your case for AA being the appropriate counter for this is absurd and fundamentally racist and discriminatory at its core."
unpopularopinion,ff5h8hy,t1_ff5gu0a,1579592761.0,">Without it we tended to have pretty imbalanced. Woth people being over looked... Fuck. Uh...

You're making an assumption that because the races were not totally balanced there was implied bias by the selection system based on their race and I don't think thats a position you can support.

The argument that has merit is that due to racism in the government preventing black people in inner cities from having access to proper education they are being discriminated upon by having their test scores being weighed equally against other races who don't have those same challenges.

To that I say that we are adjusting the wrong thing and that the education system is not racist and is quite fair based upon the merits of their education and the content of their character and to adjust the system based on their skin color is what makes it racist.

We should be tackling the fundamental issues causing the disparity (poor education) and not trying to adjust the filter in a racist manner.

>Do you want separate water fountains again!?!?

No, but you should ask the people advocating for black only schools and black only graduations etc if they want segreation again.

>
I'd like to think we are past it, that with removal colleges would focus on merits. But it takes ONE racist person to destroy that on admissions. And that's the issue. One bad egg can destroy the whole system (or one rich parent with a coach willing to fudge some numbers)

Are you really saying that one person breaking federal law to accept a bribe means that we need to break apart the whole system based upon acceptance based on merit?

Come on.

>
I just don't think it would work to pull it out without it. But also wish for something better or the ideal of needing nothing. That's just not humanity though.

Education worked just fine for hundreds of years without having affirmative action horseshit into the system.

Why don't we just judge people based on their education, schooling, and personal merit, and not judge it based on the skin color?

It really seems like minorities IMHO are the ones that keep playing the race card the hardest and wanting to see racist policies implemented.

I'm the one advocating for judging everyone equally and tackling the underlying issues and you're the one advocating for racist policies that discriminate against whites and asians."
unpopularopinion,ff5h0n6,t1_ff5f8v0,1579592483.0,"> People were not born biased, the bias formed somewhere.

Go ahead and make your case about where that bias is formed and how we should adjust it.

>I provided proof they are being biased against. Until bias stops happening against them, then actively taking steps to counter it is what you can do to alleviate it.

What active steps are you proposing to counter the fact that black names get less call backs even from those companies that have non bias procedures and steps specifically to avoid those situations?

It sounds like you're throwing something completely unable to be tackled and using it as a justification for a racist policy like AA.

>
So your solution is just to allow an already marginalized group to continue being more marginalized and do nothing to counter it?

No my solution is to actually tackle the issue by properly funding inner city schools and ensuring that the primary school education system is doing the best to help tackle the fundamental educational issues that are causing a disparity.

Not by adjusting the admissions based off of a racist standard of adjusting based simply on the color of your skin on an assumption of prejudice and discrimination.  That at its core is racist by assuming that black people are fundamentally less worthy then white people of a formal education and we need to boost them up by dragging down white people.

They should compete based upon the merit of their character and their education, and not get bonus/negatives based on the color of their skin color.

>
You mean the white people that own basically all of the land, run all of the corporations, and are over-represented in government are going to be ""slaves""? Do you even hear yourself right now?

You totally missed my point about rectifying one racist flaw in the past, by instituting an equally as racist solution to fix it.

It would be like a black majority basketball team having to accept a number of white people due to systemic discrimination about white people not being able to jump as high.

Its absurd."
unpopularopinion,ff5gti9,t1_ff5g21c,1579592239.0,">he primary reason is to assist in recovering from hundreds of years of racism and oppression.

The proper way to assist in recovering from hundreds of years of racism is not to be racism right back in an eye for an eye, its to understand the fundamental cause of the admissions disparity and tackle it.

Better primary school education, and perhaps maybe even studies to see if its a cultural thing (for example, maybe black people prefer work outside of higher education, not based upon anything just a hypothetical), etc etc.

Its just not appropriate to double down on racism to fix a problem ""caused by racsm"".

>I argue that there's no reasonable explanation for this phenomenon other than racism.

So just to be a devils advocate there are a number of reasons for this that is speculated in academia that isn't racist based.

1) Lead based gasoline in inner cities causing lead poisoning causing a higher amount of violence.  Whites in suburbs were not effected as much as urban occupants.

2) A higher overall testosterone level in blacks vs whites and other minorities

3) a completely broken family culture within the black community.  Disgustingly high fatherless households cause crime and anti-social behavior.

4) Poor funding of public education

I think its comes down to black people occupying low income areas that typically have more crime which means more cops which means more arrests.

>If you argue it's wrong because blacks typically can't afford as good of lawyers then I'd say you're correct due to historical racism.

I think that this is one of the few arguments that I think really has some truth to it,  generational wealth takes time to accumulate and that the decendants of slaves have some barriers ahead of them to accrue legitimate wealth however this is somewhat taken with some salt because many immigrants came over and were discriminated upon and were just as poor.

Frankly, I don't think we can look any different at the modern day discrimination felt by minorities compared to historically the feeling of any minority in America aside from legitimate slaves (irish, asians, etc).

>But racism in this country is at fault.

Just to touch on this, but frankly to be direct; I don't think you can look at racism as a reason as to why black americans commit 52% of all murders and other serious violent crime yet represent only 13% of the population which only gets MUCH worse when you adjust for gender.

>You're right! The right answer is not counter racism. To be honest looking at society there's no real way to effectively reverse the affects of racism over such a long period of time in any reasonable amount of time.

If there is no real way to effectively reverse the affects of racism, then we should ensure that all of our laws are non racist/discriminatory; call out racism/discrimination when we see it; and ensure that society from this point forward is equal.

There is no righting the wrongs of the past in that sense, it doesn't do any good to be racist now.

TBH; the #1 way we can combat this issue is by improving the funding of our primary school education system and ensure that we have ways for people to get educated in other ways besides higher education (trades, apprentice, etc) to help compensate with generational wealth."
unpopularopinion,ff5gdoz,t1_ff5fypl,1579591692.0,"It literally says in the description for affirmative action that its ""positive discrimination"" so it agrees with me that it is distinctly and intentionally racist.

>That's like saying ""why don't we just end corruption and punish the people caught doing it"". It's not as easy as punishing those people because they can always deny that their decision was based on race, it's extremely easy to cover up and even then racism was still rampant in society so it's not like you can always trust the law enforcers to act on something like that.

So your position is that its totally unactionable because we are unable to collect reasonable data and evidence to show that its actually happening and what is causing it.

So with that assumption your answer is that we need to accept that inherent racism happens and we need to adjust test scores in order to compensate for it.

Yet, you can't show any evidence of it actually happening on a systemic reason nor any proof that individuals nor a policy, are causing it?

Come on.

>
Yes, we should when it is a daily problem that negatively affects people's life AA wasn't only for school but jobs too, things that are needed to survive. It wasn't racist since whites had such a huge advantage and it never directly affected them.

1) You've already admitted that the admissions are not capable of being proven to be racist based either based on the individual nor based on the policies implimented by the school system themselves.

2) So that means that the whites having the advantage in schooling was because of their higher access to public education and funding for those schools (which is a fair criticism)

3) which means that implimenting policies discriminating against whites for college/university admissions is distinctly a racist policy because rather then tackle the source of the disparity between the races, you choose to discriminate distinctly on the color of their skin as opposed to tackling the fundamental underlying issue which is access to proper primary school education.

Don't pretend like I don't understand and sympathize with the inability for people in poor socio-economic area to get a proper education, but I don't think its because of racism and instead comes from how our school systems are funded.

ultimately, if you want to tackle primary school education then i'm right behind you; but if you want to discriminate against people based on their skin color to fix that problem instead i'm against you."

Explain to me how a black student born in 1990 in a poor area should get a boost over a white student born in the same area in the same timezone?

You're going to have a hard time making a strong argument that someone is experiencing strong racism and disadvantages in 1990.

I think that trying to make the world fair and compensate for poor schools and worse education isn't the job of higher education.  If you're asking for ""can we give more money to primary school education in poor areas"" you would have my support.

instead you're asking if we can right those wrongs by penalizing people based on their skin color, and I fundamentally think that is racism and wrong to its core.

Higher education should be based upon merit and scholastic talent/merit.  It should have nothing to do with race and I reject any attempt to do so.

Couple things to ask then.

1) Did they give any potential reasons for why the test scores of asians are reduced or have a lower impact so to speak vs white scores?  I'm curious.  I don't accept the ""institutional racism"" side of minorities acceptance rates and I won't accept the same for asians so I am curious if they gave extra information in the study.

2) If this is true, why are some of the lawsuits regarding AA discussing reducing asian acceptance scores as well to compensate for minorities?  

Why would they do that if Asians are intended to be benefited from AA?

(I know not every school operates the same, just curious)

Again thank you, I would like to point out that I think were kinda agreeing here.  Asians are the most hurt by AA because they have higher test scores and applications and get refused entry when they should be entered because of merit which was my point.

For what its worth, I think its equally as bad to reduce asian student attendance to get more whites into college, as it is to reduce whites to get more blacks into college."
