wholesomememes,fda32e8,t1_fczqayp,1578241059.0,"Hi, sorry for the late reply. I see other people left great replies for you too, but I wanted to leave my two cents as this is an important subject to me. The things I say here comes from personal experience. Everyone's experience is different. Never be afraid to consult a mental health professional as they can help you immensely. Seeking help isn't weakness, it's strength.

Self love is not the same as ego or pride. It comes from reflection and awareness. It comes from knowing yourself, who you are, what you want to do, and accepting it. It's an arduous task that many people struggle with every day. To look yourself in the mirror and saying ""I love you"" is something difficult to do without either feeling great pain or feeling that you're putting on an act.

The key for me is continuous repetition. Never give up on loving yourself. The things you listed for me of things you do for your friends are an amazing set of things you can do for yourself too. Continuously until you truly believe it. While you may not see the good in you, others do. The kindness and selflessness you show your friends when you can't even show it to yourself is honorable and respectable.

When you're at your lowest points, giving yourself hope is true inner strength. But it's not easy, so don't be afraid to lean on those around you, seek professional help, or even reaching out online as you're doing now. The humility and self awareness you have to ask questions like these is a strength in it of itself.

If you're like me and you bottle things up without even being aware of it then have to allow yourself to give in and feel your strongest emotions. Whether that's despair, anger, grief, or something else. Feel it, figure out why you're feeling it, and address it. 

I'm pretty sure my DMs are always open on Reddit if you just need someone to talk to. This goes anyone reading this as well."
wholesomememes,fczfetw,t1_fczenyk,1578100051.0,Make sure you're okay. Be there for yourself. Compliment yourself. Give yourself gifts. Love yourself.
wholesomememes,fczfakp,t1_fcz9ceq,1578099974.0,I relate with this hard.
KHUx,fcb2gzr,t1_fcb29og,1577581432.0,Yeah I meant tier 1-3 medals my bad but thanks! I guess I'll have to pay up the storage tax lol
KHUx,fcab8bi,t3_ee20u6,1577566019.0,"Hey, really noob question.

Should I sell my 1-3 star medals? I don't really see having a use for them and my storage is filling up and spending 100 jewels for 5 extra slots is pretty garbage."

dankmemes,faif3yy,t1_faibzvp,1576106340.0,Ah I see. I'm sure it's become way more normalized nowadays and I'm glad to hear there are more people than I initially thought on the other side of the aisle that are supportive of it. If I come across anything I'll be sure to shoot you a DM.
