HaircareScience,fem17l2,t1_fells7q,1579236452.0,"Napca is another substance already in your skin.  It's a salt I think, you can buy  it as a dilute spray. It's a humectant."
HaircareScience,fem0z5d,t1_felftc8,1579236246.0,Note that hemisqualane is not the same as squalane.
HaircareScience,feljxb7,t3_epqzzl,1579223965.0,"Squalane is great,  I often use it straight on my skin,  often after a spritz of NaPCA spray.  It's just an oil though,  not a miracle."
