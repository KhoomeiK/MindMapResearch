oddlysatisfying,fewdpsq,t1_feuzvvm,1579408873.0,A farmer from one of the nearby islands either owns or has the right to use all the land on the island and keeps his sheep there.
oddlysatisfying,fewdk2q,t1_few4tlu,1579408802.0,There are less dramatic banks elsewhere where you can get up. A farmer from one of the nearby islands has sheep grazing there and sails them back for slaughter.
FaroeIslands,felaeud,t1_fejl2h1,1579217580.0,What about the one in Leirvík? Was that not classed as a murder? The guy that was shot with a rifle?
todayilearned,fei85my,t1_fei27h3,1579132424.0,"It's not that it outflew missiles per se, but you need to consider how far they have to travel prior to actually catching the plane. Cruise altitude was 80.000ft and the **official** top speed is mach 3.5 - the true top speed has yet to be declassified. Brian Schul, who flew the plane, said that every pilot had his own personal top mach number. Just from the moment you've spotted it until you've decided to fire something at it, the plane will have travelled a collossal distance and it's 2.5 times further up than conventional aircraft.

It's like a car rocketing past a police radar trap 3 miles away at 300mph - you're not catching it."
todayilearned,fef22xn,t1_feemoeg,1579046356.0,"I'm from the Faroe Islands, which in itself is rural as fuck, and I used to be a mail carrier. One time, years ago, a kid had been sent to Denmark for schooling due to some of his special needs and he was from one of the more remote communities here. One day, the kid wanted to write his mom a letter, but he hadn't done anything like that before and this was way before ebay or amazon, so he didn't know the address. So the kid literally adressed it to ""mom"", not her name, just mom, put the town name on the envelope, stamped it and dropped it in the nearest mailbox.

The danish sorting center would under normal circumstances ship it back, but saw that it was a child's handwriting and recognized the faroese town, so they sent it this way. The handlers here obviously knew the town and relayed the letter to the local postie and him, having been a mail carrier there for years, knew there was only one of the local kids currently in Denmark and dropped the letter off at his mom's house.

So, all in all, a letter addressed to mom made it across two countries and all the way home."
AskReddit,fe61q8d,t3_ensnw3,1578879822.0,"For me it was online gaming, but not in a traditional sense. I became an admin on a server with a fairly active forum. Composing replies to unban requests and support threads while trying to maintain a somewhat professional tone definitely helped me shape my english into what it is today. There's obviously always going to be room for improvement, but I'd say most of it's from there alongside consuming english media."
AskReddit,fe56a1o,t1_fe53h6m,1578866027.0,"It highly depends on the reason for the attack, yes, but only if the dog defends itself or it's a misunderstanding. Dogs can be incredibly dangerous and OP stated that he'd been bit ten times. A dog like that should be put down, period."
AskReddit,fe4lzfk,t1_fe3ggr5,1578860700.0,"I completely understand your reaction and have experienced something similar. That said, a dog that uncontrollable should be put down."
AskReddit,fd2g990,t1_fcy2134,1578146781.0,Me too. It sucked.
aww,fczmn8k,t1_fczkfbb,1578104552.0,For some reason bad neighborhoods hadn't crossed my nind. That obviously makes a lot more sense

aww,fcxwjt5,t1_fcxtq0q,1578071490.0,"Very few dogs will be aggressive if a stranger doesn't present them with a treat and if you're that scared of dogs, you shouldn't be a mail- or delivery driver."
aww,fcxvu1r,t1_fcxka0o,1578071272.0,"It doesn't always work. I used to be a postie, love dogs (grew up with them) and always carried treats with me, but that doesn't stop shitty dogs or shitty dog/owner combos from existing and I was attacked a couple of times. Some dogs are just aggressive and see you as a threat."
funny,fcssibc,t1_fcscayd,1577923998.0,"I see. It does make sense from a practical standpoint as they're spacious, but I've never been a fan of crossovers. That said, the Explorer Police does seem like a well thought out patrol car.

Where I'm from they mainly use VAG or Mercedes stationwagons, but they don't have the laptops up front, so they don't have the same issues."

Appreciate the insight, though. I know the Crown Vic was discontinued, but has the Taurus been as well?"
gifs,fcr2853,t1_fcpfyl5,1577895713.0,"Yes, I actually do. Feeling victimized by authority has to be exhausting in the long run and will take its toll on someone in the long run. You didn't answer my question either, but that's alright.

Well, it has to be an assumption, as it's wrong, but fair game to you, man.

Happy new year!"

gifs,fcos21o,t1_fcoqzui,1577840015.0,I'll take that as a yes. I can't say I envy you. I do hope you get better soon.

AskReddit,fcchhhb,t1_fcceouo,1577598442.0,"Your statement had nothing groundbreaking to it, didnt ""go against the flow"" and wasn't outside any common thought. You either made a claim that you can't back up or targeted a group for something that isn't wrong."

IdiotsInCars,fc7fnr0,t1_fc76cbv,1577506003.0,"I'm not disagreeing with you, nor discrediting the fact that I'd probably bury the accelerator myself should I find myself in the aforementioned situation, but the derestricted portions of the Autobahn have to live up to quite specific criteria that can't be compared to your average highway/interstate. Furthermore, the mindset and lane discipline of the drivers there is completely different (stay the fuck out of the far left lane unless you're flying - especially late at night) and how heavy a car can become through the slightest of bends when you're pushing 150+ can really catch you out."
