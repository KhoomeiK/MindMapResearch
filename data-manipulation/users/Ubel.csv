They don't have to worry about Nitrogen or anything regarding that because the game will upload whatever Nitrogen created map you made, to the other players on the server automatically.

One bit of advice I can give however, Nitrogen will by default leave a massive PNG image of the world map in the created world folder, for an 8k map this can be like an 80MB image file. 

You want to delete this file so you don't have to spend more time uploading 80MB to every single client on your server. (it can greatly reduce time it takes for them to first join your server because it uploads the entire world folder to every client)"

> The use of hops spread to the Netherlands and then to England. In 15th century England, an unhopped beer would have been known as an ale, while the use of hops would make it a beer. Hopped beer was imported to England from the Netherlands as early as 1400 in Winchester, and hops were being planted on the island by 1428. The popularity of hops was at first mixed—the Brewers Company of London went so far as to state ""no hops, herbs, or other like thing be put into any ale or liquore wherof ale shall be made—but only liquor (water), malt, and yeast."" 

>However, by the 16th century, **ale had come to refer to any strong beer, and all ales and beers were hopped**, giving rise to the verse noted by the antiquary John Aubrey: 
> 
>     Greeks, Heresie, Turkey-cocks and Beer
> 
>     Came into England all in a year.
> 
> the year, according to Aubrey, being the fifteenth of Henry VIII (1524).

You say they made the beer in the winter and it was already bad by the summer, definitely didn't contain hops. 

I wonder how the dutch messed this up so badly because it appears they had experience with hops as early as the 1300's: 

https://www.jeeh.it/articolo?urn=urn:abi:abi:RIV.JOU:1992;2.281&ev=1

From Page 7: 

By 1326 the city of Delft reserved the brewing of hopped beers to the winter months, likely because they knew they would last through to the summer   (but there's apparently no concrete evidence this is exactly why it was reserved to winter brewing.) 

So 300+ years before your quoted situation with the dutch navy's beer going bad, the dutch knew strong beer could last a long time. 

From Page 9: 

Then in the 1400s the Dutch cities were exporting large amounts of hopped beer to other cities, between 1418-1419 Antwerp local brewers produced only 25% of the cities beer with the city of Haarlem (~108 miles away) providing 97% of the remaining 3/4s 

So by the early 1400s they were exporting strong beer some distances, proving again it could last a long time, though if it could last 6 months at this time, we do not know. 

So it's crazy that almost 250 years later, their navy would be so foolish as to not put in contract the need for strong beer. It was well known on practically the entire European continent at this point that hopped beer lasted much longer. I wonder how an oversight like that occurred?"
7daystodie,feg8lgu,t1_feg8cd7,1579082241.0,"My base was funnel shaped with a small secured area with 2 sets of steel poles in between me and the zombies nd I funnel them into the 4 sets of electric posts, so it's basically a large U shaped base with stairs in the top of the U leading them into the secured area. 

I'm not going to build a U within a U to have tunnels for the electric fence posts because if the zombies break through a wall they would get into my secured fighting area, so I have a ladder with bottom 2 rungs missing to jump up through a hatch into walkway above the funnel area where I can open hatches and repair the fence posts through there all from safety. 

Again, if I left tunnels so I could repair them without climbing onto the roof, the zombies would see the wall as hollow, see it as a path to me and attack it instead of coming straight towards the 2 sets of steel poles and my fighting position. 

My more recent base is built on top of 4 steel pyramids as legs with blade traps all around the bottom and it's been flawless so far just haven't gotten to a super high game stage. It's built so that even if they take out 1 entire leg the rest of the structure should still have integrity. The legs are like 8 blocks thick steel at the bottom so it'd take a good few demo's to do it and depending where I stand in the base I can funnel them towards a different leg, not that they even really attack pyramids."

Jesus Christ, your base must be PERFECTION.

Also the electric fence closest to me can be repaired through a hatch that is literally 2 blocks to my left/right while fighting the zombies, it's only the OTHER THREE electric fences farther away that require climbing a ladder to repair. Redundancy. 

Fighting position is behind 2 layers of steel poles, can't really fix the electric posts in front of those poles without having to get to an area safely on the other side. I'm not about to leave it 100% poles cause explosion/vomit would destroy stuff so I need to have solid walls and thus you cannot fix the 3 electric fences far away from my fighting position without climbing a ladder and going down a hatch behind 2 steel block thick walls. 

I'd like to see you have 4 sets of electric posts that you can repair from your fighting position?

They basically have to one up themselves regarding nits/color accuracy every year and I'm not sure the 90 or 120hz panels can do that. They definitely wouldn't downgrade their nits, that's for sure. The S20 has to look brighter than the S10 while on display in retail, it's one of the biggest things they think consumers look for.

It's just a waste of money/memory/time and the vast majority of consumers are not going to come close to using it before they upgrade their phone again. It's sad. It's a way to make people pay more. 

I personally see it as 90%+ of the consumers buying them, throwing 4GB+ of high end memory into the trash after a couple years because the entire time they owned their phone they never went over 4GB of memory usage. I feel like people on this sub forget the average user and what they actually do sometimes. The Galaxy line used to be for power users but now everyone buys them en masse. Most of my friends have a Galaxy phone. 

People buy them just for the camera, screen and quality control. 

I don't know if you remember back in the days of the Galaxy S3, there was an Exynos and Snapdragon varient like usual, the Snapdragon one had 2GB memory but the Exynos that year was actually faster SoC with only 1GB memory.

Some people bought the Exynos on purpose because it was faster (had more cores I think?) but then about 2 years later I see everyone on reddit saying how the Snapdragon was the only good one (as a mid tier/cheap phone) because it had 2GB of memory and still worked well with apps like GMaps (which could use like almost 800MB+ at the time by itself) and not bog down while multitasking with GMaps. 

Meanwhile the 1GB Exynos was quite lacking and not recommended even 2 years after release. 

My point being, *we're not really in that situation anymore*, 2 years later a phone with 4GB of memory is still using LESS than 3GB even while using a ton of apps and TWO mapping apps. In 2 MORE years I bet my 4GB will still be fine unless they release new UI change with a ton of new pretty animations and shit.

That's enough for 3000 cobblestone block upgrades from flagstone, clay is just as easy if not easier to get. I imagine I could get 10k cobblestone blocks in a good few hours (real time) of playing. 

I wouldn't guess how many blocks this castle is, but I'd say around 10,000 blocks? Even if it's 20k, still doable. 

Honestly, getting paint to paint that many blocks would be far more time consuming?

I think you could mine enough mats to build this out of cobblestone in like a week or two max of playing a few hours a day.

Now if it was built out of concrete or reinforced concrete, THAT's your time killer. 12 stone to every 1 cement + lots of time is insanity.

Reinforced concrete would cost 24x the amount of stone/clay compared to cobblestone, to build this castle, not even counting the crazy time to make the concrete or the sand you need.

EDIT: Very rough math, roughly counted the size of the main squareish castle in the middle of the photo, the large square structure, seems to be about 60 blocks wide by 35 deep max, that's 2100 blocks to build a 1 block tall solid surface covering the area. 

It's about 20 blocks tall including the towers so add another 3800ish blocks for height (obviously it would be less because not the entire structure is this tall)

That would be a one block thick walled square the size of the main 4 walled castle in OP's image and it costs ~5900 blocks plus like I said my math was very conservative because it includes building a four walled structure as high as the towers on the castle. 

Obviously his castle is double walled, has a roof in places and has extra features and the walkways/stairs in the right of the image, but still 5900 blocks gets you around 50% of it by the looks of it, again I'm only talking about the main squareish middle area.

lgg5,fe6qcx6,t1_fe53ejh,1578900471.0,"Yeah, repair myself a phone that was brand new, 3 months old and under warranty lol. Buying a used V20 wasn't possible because I bought the G5 on release and the V20 didn't come out until like 5 months later. 

Seems like LG fixed most of the quality control issues on newer models since. (I've heard of screen problems on newer models though.) 

I don't really see the reason to buy a used phone because I usually buy new with warranty and keep the phone for ~3 years until upgrading again. If I bought a used phone, it couldn't be brand new tech and wouldn't last or perform as long. 

Plus most used phones today don't have a removable battery, so to buy used, the quality of the original battery is in question and while I am capable of repairing things, I'd rather not have to literally unglue my phone to change the battery because it's full of glue and epoxy to keep it waterproof. 

When I got my S8+ the V40 had just come out which offered me nothing over the S8+ really, afaik it has no IR Blaster, no removable battery, smaller battery and shittier display/camera. 

Plus like I said, I was done trusting LG after their shitty customer service so I went with the S8+ and I've been happy since. (aside from lack of IR blaster but again at that time no current flagships offered it and still don't.)

My previous phone to the LG G5 was a Galaxy S3 and it lasted me 4 years of abuse with no problems so after this I'm likely to stick with Samsung considering I've had good experiences.

If a company made a waterproof phone with a great camera, top of the line screen, removable battery, microSD, IR Blaster and wide angle lens with flagship SoC I would switch brands in a heartbeat though.

The display quality on the S8+ is noticeably better than the G5 even when lowering the res of the S8+ to 1080p.

The S8 and S9 line both broke world records for nits, color accuracy and peak nits I believe. I live in a very sunny area so this, plus OLED generally being less reflective, is also important to me in a phone. Samsung seems to be continuing this tradition of always being the best regarding this.

(I haven't checked in a couple years but it's ironic because generally Apple sources their OLED's for iPhone from Samsung and iPhone's tend to have around the 2nd best nits compared to the Galaxy series, Samsung saves the best panels in the world for their phones.) 

So considering that, in the future I may buy an S20 or S21 etc, seems like the camera on the S20 is going to be actually next level and not just rehashes like the past couple years plus the display is likely to be bar none the best/brightest. 

I still want an IR blaster, but again no one can offer me that in a newly specced device."
lgg5,fe4xetn,t1_fe4s9m9,1578863721.0,"Not gonna use that as my main phone considering I already have an S8+ for the past 2 years. 

LG quality control also leaves much to be desired, most of my friend's G5's GPS is useless now (and was within 2 years) and my personal G5 had to be sent back to LG TWICE for repairs within 3 months of purchase because it bootlooped FROM THE FACTORY. 

I still liked the phone, but I honestly am not sure if I can buy another LG phone after that, their customer service is horrible. My GPS started messing up about 18 months into owning it and after 2 years was useless, that's around when I got the S8+. 

Each time they repaired the bootlooping, they used shitty UPS Ground shipping, taking a week to get to them and a week to get back to me and about 10 days time in their warehouse for repairs, so almost a month each time without a brand new phone I just bought a month(s) prior... They wouldn't upgrade the return shipping to priority even if I offered to pay. 

Then when I received the phone back, it was covered in stickers from their internal tracking system (like with serial numbers so they know who's phone it is) that the techs didn't remove, bits of tape and fingerprints all over. Just nothing professional about it at all. My phone even had slight marks on it from where they opened the case with tools. Also why didn't they wear gloves? 


Remember this was their flagship product, I definitely didn't receive flagship customer service. Flagship should be like the Cadillac or Mercedes Benz of products and service. 

Meanwhile Samsung has authorized repair centers all over, can do standard stuff the same day often and I've been told they use 1day/2day shipping standard on all under warranty repairs if you can't go to a repair center. Plus I've never even had a Samsung phone require warranty service because they actually do quality control."

My G5 is 4 years old now and the original batteries (I had 2) are both dead. One will not even turn the phone on or charge. It stays at ""charging 0%"" forever, no matter how long it's plugged in. The other battery swelled up and I disposed of it because it swelled so much it wouldn't even fit in the phone anymore. 

You have to understand this is an old phone now and IMO LG did not use quality batteries in it. 

My phone was only used as a main phone for 2 years max and sat around being used as a remote the rest of the time, I also DO NOT use my phone much and even when it was my main phone, I got like 1hr SoT a day, I'm not the person on my phone for 5 hours a day absolutely destroying the battery, so this is more proof that LG used shitty batteries. 

(I had a four year old Galaxy S3 that WAS used for the entirety of those 4 years as my main phone and its battery held up that entire time, more proof LG uses shitty batteries. After 4 years the S3 itself actually died and wouldn't turn on but the battery still worked in other S3's.)"

That's the morning after hoard night, no zombies on screen at linked section, just walking around my base checking for damage/loot and you'll see it often drop to 55FPS or even 50 (and I think 43 for one instance) if you watch for a min or so. You'll see it almost constantly hitting 59 or 58FPS here, the game is not smooth. Watch me walk up/down the ladder in the middle of the base, it's quite choppy. (FPS doesn't drop much, but visually it's choppy)

Even looting the loot bags is choppy and sometimes they don't even appear on screen before I hit R and loot them, like I don't even see the interface of the bag the lag is so bad. There's discrepancies in timing, like it lets me loot the bag before the interface is even graphically displayed? 

It's playable, but not smooth in the least. Other games do not do this. 

Even a 1-2 FPS drop from 60FPS(my monitor) is immersion breaking and causes visual disturbances/lag. 

So earlier in the video when it's at a constant 35-50FPS because zombies are on screen, definitely proves this game is unoptimized as shit when you can't run it on a high end brand new rig. The game needs to support more threads, right now it seems like it uses 2 threads/cores max. I think the only thing I could do to improve performance is faster single thread rating by overclocking my brand new Ryzen 5 3600 with an aftermarket HS/F. 

My settings are medium textures, medium trees, max draw distance, shadows low and everything else is off.

Anyway, my initial point being, if my rig with a 3600 and 32GB memory goes to 35FPS lows while fighting a few zombies (literally a few, hoard is set to default 8 and in the video it goes to 35FPS with as few as 3-4 zombies on screen), how can they expect any console to play the game? 

They can't, which is why they stopped development. Consoles would have like 10FPS lows considering their hardware is vastly inferior.

That or gimp consoles entirely with a draw distance of like 200 meters .. 

I think Unity engine came out with Alpha 16 which is right when they stopped updating consoles."
