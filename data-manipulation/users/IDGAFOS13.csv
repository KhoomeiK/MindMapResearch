My comfy Levi's 541 are 40"" waist, and 15"" thigh. But I tried on a pair on N&F Easy Guy with 40"" waist and 14.5"" thigh, and those were skin tight on my thighs and I couldn't even button them up.

These Atlas are also 40"" waist, with a 14.75"" thigh, but I can't try them on first. I'll have to order them online, and I'm worried they won't fit either. Unless they stretch. There's one larger size with 42"" waist and 15.5"" thigh. Maybe that's the answer."

The ""wall"" you're feeling with the RSX is worn synchronizers in the transmission. They're what allow gear changes to happen smoothly. They're made from softer brass, as opposed to the steel material of the gears, and are meant to be the wear item in the transmission.

Every manual transmission will eventually suffer from worn synchronizers. Perhaps the only way to slow the wear is to shift gears carefully (clutch use, speed difference between gears, etc.) and changing the fluid regularly."
