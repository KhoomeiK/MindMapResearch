AskReddit,feo48ht,t1_fenxw6y,1579294944.0,Same here.   Trust....i used to give it so freely. I've been burned badly. I dont know what to believe in anymore. I suppose if the person I want to trust would stop lying it would be easier for me.... But that doesn't seem to be happening. I have lots to figure out.

relationship_advice,fck65yw,t1_fcivqe0,1577717696.0,"Well put! A relationship of equals.... Means EVERYTHING to the success of a marriage. And coming as close as possible to sharing equal input, responsibility, use of resources, and spending of personal and family time is crucial to both individuals sense of satisfaction and overall well-being.

It's much about the balance. Of course there will be times when one person carries the other.... For many reasons... But overall that should balance out, too."

Advice,fc8odl7,t1_fc8mjm4,1577539012.0,"Thanks for your response. We are knocking on the door of divorce. He said he would call later....twice over text .and after all that has happened I have asked for some reassurance that I matter. We spoke for less than five minutes in the morning..and I wanted to hear his voice and so did the kids. I specifically told him I'm struggling. clingy or not..its not a lot to ask for a quick call iMO. And my wishes should matter. I wanted to talk. He's not working. He's on vacation and I am alone here taking care of the household and kids.  Also I was trying to discuss plans for the new year to solidify what we were doing.   I would have been OK if he hadn't told me he'd call....and then blew me off. I'd like to have a partner that cares for me enough to give me 2 min of his time.... when he says he will.  For the record I don't need two calls a day... One would have e sufficed...but he said he'd call again.... And I looked forward to it all day.
 
Helped."
Advice,fc7qobh,t1_fc7pqpi,1577516185.0,My gut aches... All the time. Thanks  helped.
Advice,fc7qmut,t1_fc7qka3,1577516152.0,Thank you. Helped.
Advice,fc7qksc,t1_fc7q35w,1577516108.0,Kids are between 2-14. He's mediocre at best with them. For the brief moments he gives them...hes a OK dad. Good is a stretch. The marriage mostly sucks. We are in counseling. The issue is..i love him. And I thought if he loved me too we could work through the turmoil. Sadly I have not wanted to face his lack of effort. I think if you really truly love someone it can work out. Also... If you really truly love someone...you're not put out by 2 quick calls a day. My reality sucks.  You helped.
Advice,fc7q6oe,t1_fc7p9bo,1577515808.0,We have been in counseling for almost a year. We live apart. I have been trying to accept him for who he is...but i cant even expect the bare minimum from him. We spoke this morning for about 5 min. I told him I missed him a lot. He had to go...so he said he'd call later. I looked forward to chatting about our New Years Eve plans to finalize the details. And the kids wanted to say hello. I waited all day....then he went to dinner... So I waited some more. Then at 10 pm I felt frustrated and texted. I got a text back saying basically shit happens and right after dinner they watched a movie. It's a bs blow off. When you love someone you don't mind a quick conversation. He doesn't love me. I have to accept this. His effort has always been minimal...abd the scraps of his time he offers up to me....are just  not enough. This isn't a reciprocal love.
Advice,fc7ppue,t1_fc7p8ag,1577515393.0,"Helped. He is and has always been lacking. Recently things got even worse between us..and he really hurt me. Instead of being humble....he has become even more rude, standoffish, and clear about how little effort he intends to put in. It's messed up."
Advice,fc7plbh,t1_fc7p3ey,1577515280.0,Helped. I've suspected this for a long time. I think he stays because he uses me for money and childcare.

offmychest,fc7cnni,t1_fc65122,1577503542.0,"Yet it is tolerated...and it's so hard to break free from the ""bond"" that keeps you in it. Crazier even is when you know how being treated right is and feels, but you still endure the abuse in the hopes that things will change for the better. It's a trap, a prison, a vicious hold that taunts you day and night...and while men may experience it too...women are far more susceptible to this abuse of power and control. This is a fact."
