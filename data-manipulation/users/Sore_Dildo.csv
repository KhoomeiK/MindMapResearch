relationship_advice,ffhulup,t3_etp9tx,1579954655.0,"He provided for you and sent you to a good school.That shows he cares about you and wants the best for you.He may have been a dick head but he obviously wants you around and he obviously loves you.You said you want him to be your best friend,sorry buddy but parents aren't supposed to be your best friend.They are supposed to be your parents and that's a totally different role.Sure it might seem different looking at other people's relationships with their parents but don't worry about them.That's them and this is you and they most likely have other issues that you dont see on the outside looking in.Sure he might have fucked up alot but that's because he's human and we all fuck up.What's important is that he has had your best interest in mind and took care of you and loved you all the way up to this point.Now that you found out about this tumor your life is about to change.Life might be hitting you and getting real in a way that it never has before.You might not be able to imagine what it would be like with out him but there will come a time where he will pass away and I'm sure you know that.Now and from here on out is the time you should let him know you love him and want him around despite everything that has happened in the past.You need to get over your anxiety and what ever is holding you back from letting him know you love him.You know he might not pull through this.You need to spend these days like they are his last now.You are so blessed man I hope you know that.I'm a guy who's 25 and I haven't seen my dad in over 10 years.He passed away suddenly and it effected my whole life and ripped my family in pieces.I think about him and miss him every day and he had flaws and acted like a total douchebag sometimes just like how you talked about your dad but he still loved and supported me just like your dad.There were times I was mean spoiled asshole to him and I regret that.There is not a day that goes by that I don't think about him and it's been 10 long years.I wish I could tell him I love him and hug him one more time.I wish I would've at least had a warning and a chance to spend his last days like they should've been spent.I wish I couldve at least said goodbye knowing that was it.One day you will wish you had one more day with him.So please I beg of you to realize you are blessed and lucky you've had a dad around this long and your father loves you despite everything else.Please spend the rest of his days letting him know you love him,forgive him and want to spend time with him.You will regret it if you don't.Please don't let this time go to waste.I hope the best and I pray for you and your family even though Idk you."

relationship_advice,ffhmj33,t1_ffhj7mz,1579942432.0,I guess my opinion is biased because I got kicked out of my parent's house and my wife left her parent's house willingly because she was being abused.We were around your age.We had to survive with no help from anybody but each other.I mean if you're okay with your boyfriend being dependent on hand outs from his parents  and you being kept a secret to those people to keep finances coming in that's cool.I guess we just don't see eye to eye on that.As far as the other shit goes though social disagreements and hardships will happen from time to time and you'll feel bad about and he'll feel bad about it but all that will pass as long as you dont do anything too messed up and work things out.But another word of advice is the more weird messed up situations you get yourself/find yourself in the more problems and arguments you're gonna have.
relationship_advice,ffhj38p,t1_ffhivo6,1579937542.0,I mean he should be proud of you and showing you off to his family like you're the best person in the world.
relationship_advice,ffhivo6,t1_ffhi97a,1579937265.0,"He needs to tell his mom and stop depending on her money then.It's possible to support yourself with out depending on other people to hand you money and things.You guys can find a way if need be,its not impossible to support yourselves.He's his own person now and his parents should understand that and respect.They're pieces of shit if they just abandon him because of who he loves.If the case is really the fact that he thinks theyll stop giving him money if he loves somebody they dont like then he should just say ""fuck the money"" why would he want it from them if they're like that?They might hold that over his head anyways if they really do get mad about his love for you.You're more important than him getting mommy and daddy money.Those are the  problems that need to be taken care of right there.The issue isnt that u hurt his feelings or you felt bad about an argument or whatever because that will happen all the time throughout life if you plan on staying with him.Conflicts and problems will come up all the time."
relationship_advice,ffhi5hh,t1_ffhi104,1579936310.0,So you're saying his mom might kick him out for being with you?
relationship_advice,ffhhy6x,t3_etnkas,1579936043.0,"He'll get over it,and you'll both most likely make more mistakes down the road because you're human.It's just a matter of what you do to deal with the issues you both have.He'll get over it and there will be more you and him both will have to get over.Thats just how life and relationships are.What's his mom's problem though?Seems like he's trying to keep you a big secret or something.Thats not cool."

relationship_advice,ffecq1b,t3_et5can,1579843289.0,"Couples in relationships dont typically have friends of the opposite sex unless they're like other couples.You're best bet is to find your own girlfriend then try to build a friendship her boyfriend and her with your girlfriend.That way you could hangout as couples.Even though that's not even guaranteed, other than that she's pretty much gone and not gonna be friends with you anymore.She's committed to her boyfriend and he's sure as hell not gonna want a single guy like you hanging out with her.They don't want you to get in between them."

relationship_advice,ffe19sg,t3_et3nx8,1579834099.0,"I mean If I was the boyfriend I would want to know.It might bring alot of drama though.Maybe try to get ur friend to confess and break up or whatever they decide cuz that's the right thing for to do after she fucked up like this.Idk if I'd even be friends with her after knowing that because I would've lost total respect.You could tell her how wrong it is and why she needs to confess or you aren't gonna be her friend anymore.You could even be her like ""you tell him or I tell him because hes a really great guy and you dont deserve him after what you did"".She might even say no and you'll stop being friends with her and then she might tell him in fear that you're gonna tell him first even if you decide not to.It should be coming from her I think but you can do what ever you feel is right.If you do decide to tell him you better bring some evidence and it better be some compelling evidence or shes gonna lie to him and say you're a liar then theyre both gonna think your the bad guy that's lying to try to break em up so be ready for a shit show if you go that route.Most likely if you tell anybody any of the stuff I told you you'll lose friendship over it but I mean how much is the friendship really worth now?She stabbed her SO in the back so what makes you think she wouldn't stab you in the back?I mean you might like being friends with a cheating scumbag piece of shit and even in that case at the very least you should tell her what she did was completely fucked up and wrong.Again I'm sayin if i was him i would want to know even if it came from my girl's(or soon be ex's) friends.I'm not one of those ignorance is bliss people,I would rather know the truth than be happy with a cheater that didnt deserve me.

AskReddit,ffc1a4x,t3_estm7e,1579788992.0,Well I decided that was the last time lines would get crossed with the idiots I was working with at the time.So I gathered up my tools and got my last paycheck then I just told my boss hey I'm about to go fishing and I'm not sure if I'll be back.... ever......Needless to say I never went back. I just called my union hall on the way to the place I was gonna fish at and told them I drug up off the job I was on.Then i gotta call to goto another job less than a week later like I expected would happen.No big deal really.
