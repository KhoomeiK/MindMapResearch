Are you training for anything in particular? The only other advice I have is to not be too attached to BMI, especially considering you will have about a year of consistent strength training under your belt."

fatlogic,ffr2tzx,t1_ffquiph,1580149238.0,"What I think you need to watch out for is getting adequate recovery.

I don't know your current goals, weight, or composition, but the faster you cut, the more muscle you lose.

I'm in a similar boat beginning to cut weight, but I'm starting by moving from a surplus to maintenance, then increasing a deficit slowly to 500 calories.

Another thing to consider is that your TDEE will be a moving target as your intensity will vary."
fatlogic,ffk22rj,t1_ffjzfic,1580013427.0,"I'll have you know I ran fifteen miles, spent 4.25 hours lifting, and an hour in power yoga and... Still only hit 3300."
fatlogic,ffij4rx,t3_etrtx3,1579975105.0,"I think I need to start losing weight again next week. That's nothing new to me, but the long term training program on top of it is.

The past three months were a bit rough, dropping weight from now-resolved medical stuff and putting it back on in the gym constantly. I'm burning ~3300/day and definitely think I look better. https://imgur.com/a/8yrPdAN

I still want to put on more weight, but I don't want a deficit larger than 500 calories to preserve lean mass. Running makes me hungry af, so I want to be able to take a deficit break of a couple days.

I guess I'm gonna cut down to 3,000 calories/day after a mini-vacation and adjust accordingly as I go.

Inb4 *I wish I could eat that much!* Get you a pair of running shoes and get to work. Also, cook it all yourself, no fast food."

4% is not a healthy body fat percentage, and I don't think it's possible to walk around everyday at 4k calories.

Even to maintain, he'd need to run 5+ miles or lift for 2+ hours"

fatlogic,fffcemi,t1_fffc3d8,1579880878.0,"Same! In the past I've used the marathon to ""get in shape"" after being lazy all winter, then drop off as soon as I finish.

I put on too much weight listening to bro science last winter, but have only two extended breaks from working out, one for an ankle injury from the marathon (and I was back doing upper body two weeks later) and one from an oral surgery when I couldn't get the nutrition to make it through a workout.

I feel like I could finish a marathon next week, but I want to get my sub4 goal I missed last year"

The person is not aware of my training program, medical history, or my short and long term goals. 

It's a hill workout as part of marathon training. The first ~half mile is flat, followed by half a mile at a ten percent grade where hill repeats on a ten percent grade for 0.45 miles. Last three miles are back to the river and flat.

Of course my first two splits look like garbage, but I'm not about to take a fucking amphetamine for it."
running,ffd0sii,t3_eskroa,1579811168.0,"For marathon training, one day a week I've started running from the lowest point in my city to the highest. Today I started adding repeats in the top half.

One mile to get there, a miles worth of repeats, three more miles. Going to increase the pace to get under 9 minutes/mile overall before adding any."
