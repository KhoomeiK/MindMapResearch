If teams have such great hitting pitchers, the manager is allowed to not name a DH and just have the pitcher hit. It has happened in the AL maybe three or four times since the DH rule went into effect. They don't do it anymore. Stats say it's a losing strategy. Almost every team can find a more reliable hitter than even the best hitting pitcher. 

For all of last year there were maybe 14 pitchers who managed to accumulate as many as ten hits. The vast majority have batting averages below .100. In almost every game it's a black hole in the lineup. Just because Jacob deGrom can hit a little doesn't mean everyone else should do it."

It's less likely that there was intentional malice involved in putting people in the wrong plan, than simple human error. So many people, so many plans, so much data, an error rate of even a hundredth of a percent is going to be a lot of people and if it's an unusual error like that there won't be a department that's set up to fix such things quickly. 

Why do governments do this? Because state governments do not want to be in the business of administrating medical and dental plans. Government employees are expensive, there are lots of restrictions, a lot of inflexibility, questionable IT systems, lots of people don't want to work for them.

It's contracted to someone who knows how to do it and is interested in keeping up with trends in the industry.
