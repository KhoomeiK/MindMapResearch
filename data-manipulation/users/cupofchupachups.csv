It's been shown that criminalizing some things is just a waste of resources. Even in the US they are starting to realize the drug war has failed. So why don't we stop?

What you are talking about simply [doesn't work](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/lsoh-cr121018.php). Violence is worse when sex work is criminalized and highly policed.

Criminalizing sex work will hurt the very people you purport to help. It's nothing to do with helping them, though. It's about having your own moral worldview validated by law. That is more important to you than outcomes. It's like abortion. Making abortion illegal doesn't stop it; it only makes it more dangerous. Promoting safe sex and providing birth control reduces abortion rates, but that is not supported in much of the US because _they don't care about outcomes._ It's all about self-righteousness.

If you really cared about sex workers and wanted this all to stop, you would support policies and programs that get at the root of why people feel they have to do it. Support basic income, education, treatment for drug abuse, breaking the cycle of abuse. I've worked with addicts, sex workers, and murderers, and none of them do it because it's fun. It's trauma all the way down. 

You want a world where nobody is allowed to do sex work. I want a world where nobody feels they have to."

Yes, the foreskin might have a purpose, but so does your armpit, the skin between your toes, and your butt cheeks. They are all warm, moist places that are perfect to grow bacteria and fungus.

Harper was saved from his worst instincts by simply not being in power to make the terrible choices that he could have. We would have been in Iraq if he was in power in 2003. Cutting the GST right before a global economic downturn is an incredible lack of foresight. Had he had is majority earlier, he would have deregulated the banks even further putting us in the same danger the US found itself in in 2008.
