BipolarReddit,fffn7n8,t3_etago0,1579887585.0,"I’ve had really bad nightmares on xanax. I don’t know why, usually it’s the opposite and it makes sleep calmer for people. But yeah, I don’t take Xanax anymore because the nightmares were too much. Sorry that you’re getting them :("
BipolarReddit,ff6gbim,t3_ernzo4,1579626580.0,I did the same thing. Good luck!
BipolarReddit,ff4xt7f,t3_erkyin,1579575027.0,"I use edibles (a bit too much tbh) and it’s been fine. It actually helps me control my alcohol use cause I crave an escape, and the weed serves as that. I would just caution against addiction cause I went down that rabbit hole a few times. But then again I have an addictive personality so maybe it really depends on the person."
bipolar,ff20p5c,t3_er0riu,1579490688.0,"I drink too much and have been trying to cut down the last few years, with mixed success. I -have- to leave it alone if I’m manic though. Mania and alcohol leads to disaster for me. Otherwise, it’s been fine and no different than any other person drinking."
bipolar,fewlznd,t1_fewl8dv,1579414140.0,Yup depression is the worst! Agh I’m so nervous it’ll happen again soon. I want this feeling of invincibility to last as long as possible.
bipolar,fewenl6,t3_eqq8j8,1579409328.0,It’s so hard to tell sometimes!
bipolar,feixq8c,t3_epc8ur,1579150127.0,I like the way that you drew the drugs!
AskReddit,fei0fat,t1_feern4b,1579127583.0,"Yup! I had bad handwriting as a kid then one day, decided to write a lot slower and make it look pretty. I think it only took a month to get back to the same speed."
BipolarReddit,feeg0ty,t3_eooxon,1579033000.0,"Sometimes it helps for me to engage my senses. Like I’ll wiggle my toes, touch my hands together, touch a cold wall, open my eyes, etc."
bipolar,feef7sn,t3_eonuqy,1579032524.0,"Yup I’m paying 300 right now, after my insurance. Someone suggested goodRX, might be an option for you too?"
TrollXChromosomes,feaijoc,t1_fe6o3kq,1578949212.0,"I agree that it’s much less than 8 hours of recreation, but the rest depends on the person. My commute is about 10 minutes, it takes me just 30 min to get ready in the morning (though tbf I skip breakfast), so I have much more than 2 hours of recreation each day. Closer to 5 hours."
bipolar,fe07sdc,t1_fdy1x6x,1578805347.0,How do you use goodrx? Do you have to sign up for it or something?
BipolarReddit,fdzmhm3,t1_fdx6vb4,1578791714.0,"I constantly adjust my meds so it helped adding 10mg prozac again. I also went to a new therapy program and while it wasn’t centered around mood stuff, we had a day to focus on depression. My therapist suggested  to make goals that are not mood based. So one day after a really stressful work day, I picked up my old crocheting things and just crocheted for hours, trying to get the anxiety out of my head. And it doing something with my hands helped so much. I usually love making art but can’t bring myself to do it when I’m deeply depressed. Crocheting was easier because it’s so repetitive.

I don’t know exactly why the shift is happening, maybe it would have happened regardless, but it feels good to look forward to something again."
bipolar,fdx6spy,t3_en5c5w,1578765903.0,"Love lamictal! So expensive though, my insurance which is usually really good doesn’t cover all of it."
BipolarReddit,fdx6cat,t3_en7wqi,1578765750.0,"I feel like I might be moving from depression into mania, but I think that I am stable for now. I have interests! Big difference from depression, when literally nothing held my attention and i would just sit there or sleep, doing nothing. I’m studying things for fun now, trying harder at work, and trying to care for my health (that’s still in progress though). I still have bad habits and my life isn’t perfect though. Calling every month to get meds is a chore, I still have a drinking problem, and work is so hard sometimes.

It feels really good though. I hope to delay the mania as much as possible."
bipolar,fdx51mo,t3_en8455,1578765434.0,"I once spent 8000 dollars on a mobile game while manic. Thinking back to it, it was so stupid, I didn’t even like that game."
bipolar,fdrq1x7,t1_fdr43es,1578688030.0,I’m glad that your boss is understanding. I have that fear and anxiety too each time I have to take a sick day. It sucks so much!
bipolar,fdqyfz3,t1_fdqqs8l,1578676754.0,"Nope, melatonin doesn’t make me manic. Does it make you? 

Yeah my manager knows I have bipolar. Unfortunately it’s part of the job, I wouldn’t want to be the only one who skips on-call shifts."
bipolar,fdpm99z,t3_em7qwf,1578632617.0,"I would be fine having children. Most people have something in their gene pool, like heart disease or cancer or depression. My genetics are pretty good besides mental illness. So while I might pass bipolar on, I’d also pass on creativity and intelligence (all of my relatives are smart and do some really awesome and diverse crafts). If my child gets bipolar, it sucks but I can be there to support them, get them the right meds and education. I think I could be a good mom.

I totally get the desire to adopt, but I don’t think it’s selfish to want to have biological children, especially if you help them through any issues that they face."
bipolar,fdplth8,t3_emccwu,1578632238.0,"I take melatonin and it’s a life saver. On the bad/manic days I combine it with trazadone, if I really need to just pass out. Sleep is so hard!

Semi unrelated rant:
My work has an on-call policy where I have to be on call for a week every few months. Being woken up in the middle of the night and having to do work is NOT good for bipolar and sleep management. Still trying to figure out the best way to handle it, as I know lack of sleep can also be a trigger for mania."
bipolar,fdplkmh,t3_emd7h8,1578632027.0,"Keeping a good sleep schedule helps curb the mania a lot. Melatonin, soothing music, etc can help for sleep if you’re manic. Other than that, therapy and medication!"
TrollXChromosomes,fdoapnv,t1_fdnacuo,1578601799.0,"Depends on how you make it! We add a little mayo and a lot of plain yogurt to it, and it makes the salad healthy and much better tasting imo."
BipolarReddit,fd5vat8,t3_ek376z,1578181938.0,"When I'm depressed, I miss the feeling of aliveness during mania. But when I'm manic, I would do anything for a day of the calmness and quiet of depression."
BipolarReddit,fd02h8j,t3_ejo48f,1578112665.0,"I like the feeling of being high a lot, though I have trouble with taking it too often. It becomes too easy to take it to avoid boredom for me, especially when depressed. I think my life would be in a better place if I never started doing weed, and I'm working on reducing how often I use it."
BipolarReddit,fcst30n,t3_eiq29s,1577924406.0,"I'm know what you mean. I graduated just two years after you. I think back to early college, which was before I struggled with depression and other mental health problems, and I worry that I'll never feel as invincible as then. I was super thin, exercised and danced a lot, just started living by myself and was happy, etc. Got into my major and was jubilant. Then mid-late college was awful and after that I had both good and bad months, but it was never as amazing as that one year.

But at the same time, I've grown and gotten less naive, picked up some new skills and hobbies, educated myself about mental health and gained a lot of empathy towards people, and redefined my goals. 

We will always have good and bad times, but I think it's important to remember that we're always growing and changing, and things can look up. Maybe differently than we expect, but still, I have hope :)"
BipolarReddit,fb9lmlc,t3_ec5d6l,1576641953.0,Omg thank god.
