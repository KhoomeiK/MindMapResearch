CompetitiveApex,fejv0bx,t1_fejt1xu,1579186478.0,"Thank you for giving it a more thorough discussion. 

Ok now I'm gonna give it a stab to your question then: What makes apex so fun and unique? 

Answer: For me it's about it being focused on team play, strategy and overcoming the random obstacles the game puts us on. (Our opinions are quite different and I will respect yours. But there are many different ideas about what makes it fun)

The devs will not have perfect decisions always all the time but they did a lot of things right too:

* They tackle the meta with new weapons and hop ups.

* Camping and Snipers buffed to give players ways to fight being 3rd partied (last time I saw, no one liked that). 

* A ranked system that rewards surviving rather then a RNG kill fest with slim chances to respawn tbh.

I've seen people complaining in Season 1 because the game took too long to end because they can't find the last team alive and there was so much to cover, I've also seen people complaining in Season 3 because there were too many teams alive.

In my opinion, these things are really much more complex to just say ""devs are taking a wrong direction"". If people really don't like the direction of the game, maybe try a deathmatch or team based game instead of a battle royale. My 2 cents."
CompetitiveApex,fejrbke,t1_fejq3ut,1579183901.0,"I'm sorry but I really can't take this reply seriously.    
I mean, what the heck do you guys know about what takes it to be a good game? You'd think your favorite streamer has it all figured down but truth is, he doesn't. He can only shoot in the dark as much. He wants something new, then he doesn't want the new thing because it sucks, he wants the other new thing now. It's kinda ridiculous. 

Apex legends is not really a game all figured out. Devs approach things carefully and have appropriate (and inappropriate) feedback. But to go full stupid and saying constantly the game sucks and devs are stupid doesn't reveal honesty. Just immaturity."
