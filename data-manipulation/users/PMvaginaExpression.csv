Size of tank, do u have a skimmer? I see u mentioned canister filter, is that your only filter? What water flow do u have? Anything agitating the surface? Do u have a lid on the tank?

I ask because it may be that if u only have a canister filter with little water movement can even be low O2 in the tank. There are many things that you learn in the hobby but the key factor is do everything slowly. Try and start with just one fish initially or just clean up crew. Get the system running. Then slowly add. That way it's less stress for the fish and you"
