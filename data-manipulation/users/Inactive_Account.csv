Any family that he had has likely moved on and forgotten him.  In his mind, it's may as well be 1992.  Sure, he knew technology was moving forward, but it's not like he got to learn to use it.  He can't function in today's society.

Honestly, I would be shocked if he doesn't commit suicide within 6 months. Terrible to say, but what is there to live for after that much time?"
college,ff8lwdi,t3_es8pib,1579684958.0,"Depends on the course material.

If it's all STEM, hell no.

If it's anything else, still hell no. Other majors have a ton of writing to making up for the easier difficulty.

I'm taking 18 credit now and working part time and active in a club.

My coursework occupies 15-20 hours per week. It's all online, so no class time.

But the general rule is 3 hours per credit per week. You'd be looking at 81 hours per week. It's not feasible. Stick to 12-15.  I'm only doing 18, because I need to stretch my aid further. I'd be 1 semester short otherwise."
ChoosingBeggars,ff8lnnh,t1_ff8lgvp,1579684586.0,"Yeah, the cheap people are the ones who would try to hold you liable for any possible plumbing issue they have in the future.  Leaky dishwasher, backed up toilet, refrigerator tap not working.  And after claiming it was your fault, they'd ask you to fix it.  And the cycle repeats."
AskMen,ff8lbo0,t1_ff8k4to,1579684078.0,"That's the rut I'm in right now.  Got out the military 2.5 years ago, where I was running to stay in shape. I didn't start lifting until I got out. I felt great then.  Worked a shitty job.  Left to go back to school full time. 

Haven't been consistent on exercise since. In August, I went for 30 days straight, then dropped. Gained 20 pounds.  Now, I've cut the weight through a better diet, but I can't force myself to exercise again."
ChoosingBeggars,ff8l286,t1_ff8kuwz,1579683675.0,"I'm assuming he bought a disposal off the shelf and wants to pay somebody $50 to install it.  He's assuming the disposal has all the parts he need, including the new pvc joints. That guy installing it is gonna need to buy at least $20 in parts and provide his own tools. 

Yeah, I take it back. I wouldn't do this for $50."
Firefighting,ff8kmdb,t3_es955d,1579683009.0,"For reference, this was supposedly a transformer fire at a solar farm in Australia.

[Here's the source with details and pictures of the incident in question.](https://imgur.com/gallery/MXue4bV)

My guess is the ""big oily muddy mess"" the owner is complaining about is AFFF. And they are mad that the firefighters didn't repair the fire damage? I guess we all need to get some training from the power companies and learn about solar as well. 

For a country that just got through such a massive wildfire, you'd think people like this wouldn't complain about them being thorough."
