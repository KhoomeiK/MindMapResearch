The server dropped the invalid data, which is only possible if it had decrypted and analyzed the encrypted payload because it is literally impossible to tell what is valid encrypted data and what is invalid data properly encrypted as the result is mathematically indistinguishable from random noise.

It’s like accessing a website over HTTPS via a proxy server. All cool. Then you discover that if you make a POST to a remote server again over HTTPS but include a typo in the name of a form field, the proxy server drops that field from the request you receive on the server.
