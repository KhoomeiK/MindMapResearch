Unrelated but interesting. Helicopters filling their buckets from swimming pools.

todayilearned,ffbq37u,t1_ffb0f4g,1579778060.0,We use the [reusable K cups](https://www.amazon.com/Reusable-Universal-Refillable-reusable-Delibru/dp/B01DP1IWKU/ref=sxin_3_ac_d_rm?ac_md=0-0-a2V1cmlnIGN1cA%3D%3D-ac_d_rm&cv_ct_cx=keurig+cup&keywords=keurig+cup&pd_rd_i=B01DP1IWKU&pd_rd_r=ef48395c-d120-4182-bb77-e4e95c249368&pd_rd_w=iSMzr&pd_rd_wg=632hs&pf_rd_p=6d29ef56-fc35-411a-8a8e-7114f01518f7&pf_rd_r=CC8NQQZ5V4D8DHSXQH3C&psc=1&qid=1579777928&sr=1-1-12d4272d-8adb-4121-8624-135149aa9081). Actually quite convenient.

technology,ff8oicz,t1_ff8hgny,1579688966.0,"I agree, although their ""drum needs replacing"" messages come unusually early and can't be overridden. Been 8 years, maybe they changed. Worked at a small-ish company with 200+ employees. Ended up adding color laser printers in all the rooms with copiers and just put them on the same type of contract. Worked well for the IT department as it generally got color cartridges off our line item budget thing and just grouped in with the 100K+ pages per copier  from the copiers per year. And it was a built-in service call if anything went wrong with them. Small headache relieved."
todayilearned,ff8nzdz,t1_ff7x56q,1579688170.0,"There are a lot in modified old coal mines on the north east coast too. Like miles and miles of giant tunnels 100's sometimes 1000's of feet underground you can drive giant trucks past each other they are so wide. It's mostly government stuff preserved on paper so there are physical records of everything if there is a worst case nuclear war / a bunch of EMP's. Pretty smart. There are ginormous seed vaults in Europe like the [Svalbard Global Seed Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault) , which,  all kinds of vaults like that have their positives. A preservation of our history if we destroy our civilization that maybe we won't do it again. Probably not. Doesn't hurt to plan."

Reading through that article, it sounds like there might be closer to 1-3000 in the entire US, including zoos. Apparently it is not really tracked well at all for private ownership."
AskReddit,fe649hl,t1_fe45l2s,1578881449.0,"Our Walmart recently upgraded to 30+ self checkouts, so they now have someone checking receipts. Best I can tell is they really only check when things aren't in bags, like a vacuum cleaner or 40 lbs of bird seed. I don't mind it. SO much quicker in and out of the place."
