oddlysatisfying,few9gjd,t1_few7vse,1579407138.0,"Look I'm just gonna stop here coz otherwise we will just be arguing this forever.
I believe that it's just a stupid Internet thing but you you are truly terrified and unable to go about your life coz of this, fine, but the majority of people don't and it annoys me to know end because it makes people with actual phobia seem less then they are."
oddlysatisfying,few7769,t1_few6rip,1579406311.0,"What coz I put a quote that says it's disgust not fear that is responsible for this supposed phobia?
Or because phobias are hard to determine they leave it open ended.. Does it make you feel better coz that's why they do it."
oddlysatisfying,few6l08,t1_few6fbp,1579406022.0,"Trypophobia is not recognized by name as a mental disorder, and so is not a specific diagnosis in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). However, it may fall under the broad category of specific phobia if the fear is excessive, persistent, and associated with significant distress or impairment.

Whether trypophobia can be accurately described as a specific phobia might depend on whether the person mainly responds with fear or with disgust. Because phobias involve fear, a response to trypophobic imagery that is based mostly or solely on disgust renders its status as a specific phobia questionable. In one study, most of the participants with trypophobia met the DSM-5 criteria for specific phobia, even though they experienced disgust instead of fear when shown imagery of clusters of holes; however, they did not meet the distress or impairment criterion."

oddlysatisfying,few5bbv,t1_few4ttz,1579405621.0,"It's not a phobia, it's an evelotionary biproduct. It's your brain saying it's wrong and to keep clear. It is not a phobia.
In fact it's only existed for a few years and was made solely on the Internet."
oddlysatisfying,fevwwvi,t1_fevfgcz,1579402493.0,"If you hold the skin as its shedding it is fine. It won't do any damage. It's if you pull on skin that is not ready to be shed that you run into problems.
Sometimes snakes need help."
oddlysatisfying,fevwld8,t1_fev7chm,1579402359.0,Not a phobia.
gaming,fegajx5,t3_eonoi5,1579085018.0,"Once in the original sims I threw a massive celebrity party and invited everyone I knew as well so the house was full to bursting. Once everyone was inside I had put all the fun stuff upstairs and once the last one was there I removed the stairs. Slowly everyone started to die when simultaneously two people gave in to the torment. The grim reaper showed up and spent two days trying to find a way to get up to the dead guys.
By the time the grim reaper decided to teleport up there another six people were dead, all the food had rotten, the floor was covered with wee and everyone kept collapsing from exhaustion."
