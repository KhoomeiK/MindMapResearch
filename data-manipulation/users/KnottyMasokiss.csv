Aerials,fegdtwt,t3_eows5e,1579089210.0,"Definitely wear high waist full length leggings and a fitted tank top (or T-shirt, I don’t recommend long sleeves). If you have any leggings that are a little extra long and can cover your heel that’s even better (personally, anyway). Bring a hand towel for sweat, a bottle of water, and a grip aid since you say you have sweaty hands. My personal fav is Secret Stuff chalk creme - But a lot of studios usually sell a grip aid or antiperspirant of some kind. 

DO NOT put on any lotion the day of class if you can avoid it. My instructor says if you absolutely have to, don’t do it any less than 5 hours before class. If you do, wash your hands with dish soap really well (works in a pinch if I forget). 

And like others said, try to not compare yourself to anyone else. My level 1 class has people who are all at different parts of their journey. Some people drop in for class can do inverts and work on the top bar, and I can’t even tuck mount. It takes so much time - only focus on yourself.
