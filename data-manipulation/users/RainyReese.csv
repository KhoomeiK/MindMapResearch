I feel as if giving whatever she bought on a stolen credit card to her brother as paybacks could cause more issues in the future if she's not taught why what she did was wrong. I am really weirded out that people are coming up with excuses as to why this should be normal behavior in lots of households when it clearly isn't and should never be no matter what age."

RATS,ffyt7jg,t3_evyu2z,1580354539.0,I don't even know how I feel about this post.
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffygbwk,t1_ffy8gfr,1580345748.0,I'm not crucifying anyone. I am just weirded out that they are laughing at their child who just committed a federal offense as if it's normal to do that.
aww,ffxy804,t3_evtynk,1580334762.0,"Awwww, this is sooo sweet. Both have the disorder?"
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffxxj6k,t3_evttna,1580334370.0,This whole scenario is weird when they are laughing about it as if stealing credit cards from them is a regular part of their life.

WinStupidPrizes,ffxm48h,t1_ffwxe0o,1580327916.0,Cannot stop laughing.
trashy,ffxamp9,t3_evlvw4,1580321229.0,I would show this to everyone at work because you know people are going confront her and rightfully so. This is exactly why I refused to eat stuff from my job when people brought stuff in. Plenty of people absentmindedly pick their noses and asses and touch stuff as well in my experiences.
confusing_perspective,ffvu13x,t3_evfn3d,1580273238.0,Why would anyone go swimming in Florida? Even outsiders know it won't end well.
crafts,ffsnrav,t3_euybqs,1580186497.0,This really is lovely. Well done!
rarepuppers,ffpjqdf,t3_eufvl6,1580096706.0,This post is turning up some very weird comments. At least the dog is happy as can be. Looks so spoiled <3
BeforeNAfterAdoption,ffjvddr,t3_etywbk,1580007987.0,A little kindness and love goes a long long way. You are a wonderful person and so are the people at the shelter that took care of him.
coolguides,ffjmheg,t1_ffjkwh6,1580001653.0,"I have never seen that information anywhere, but I have never really looked too deep into it. I did see that the highest concentration of RH negative blood is found in the Basque region/people which straddles Spain."
worldnews,ffjgzqj,t1_ffj356p,1579998041.0,"Sorry, what I meant was how she killed them? It says treating the deaths as""unexplained"". It's possible for poison to not show up right away and you can shut someone in a room with carbon monoxide.

It's so vague."
worldnews,ffj14tr,t3_etvk86,1579987761.0,"Poison or carbon monoxide, possibly? Any updates?"
PublicFreakout,ffiqkcv,t1_ffiq1d8,1579980234.0,"Uh, no, I find that people have agendas and when they put up a half assed clip of no proof of what the title claims, it's just misleading. Don't try to turn this into something it isn't."
coolguides,ffipnxo,t1_ffipbt3,1579979603.0,I have no idea if my state in the U.S. has this deal. I know I've only come across 2 others in my life that have the same blood as me and one is my twin sister.
PublicFreakout,ffipgdx,t3_etuzrq,1579979455.0,There is no context as to why this is considered a transphobic guy? You can't even tell what was said that set them off. Your title is misleading.
cats,ffi366i,t1_ffi30a6,1579963733.0,"Aw, congrats on the adoption. You will no longer have bathroom privacy for many many years lol"

cats,ffi2xj0,t3_etrk1l,1579963529.0,"My cat pushes his way in, jumps on the sink and starts headbutting me until I open the faucet."
relationship_advice,ffi26mo,t3_etq2i5,1579962884.0,"I'm sorry but anyone suggesting OP change her child's name ""out of respect"" for their mother is out of line. This may sound very harsh and I can see how some people would get upset over words but the mother needs extreme psychological help and OP needs to put a stop to how her mother is treating her children. 

Twenty five years ago is a long time to not try to get past something and then take it out on your grandchild and child. They didn't cause the trauma but are being subjected to unnecessary psychological bullshit because she refuses to get past a tragedy that has nothing to do with OP or her children. 

I would tell mom she can't see the kids anymore until she gets the help she needs because it's not fair to subject OP's family that she doesn't want to get her shit together for her own mental health. Changing a name isn't going to get OP's mom the help she needs. It's enabling her to go around getting actual help."

UnresolvedMysteries,ffadkri,t1_ff60b4o,1579733046.0,Deanna Cook and Delvecchio Patrick. She was begging and pleading while trying to breathe and you can hear all of it. That was so disturbing for me. The mother found her lifeless body in a full tub.

trashy,fethyb4,t1_fetgi0o,1579375615.0,Chances are the girls were just dicking around in the school and saw them pull up. What is up with the name calling and idiotic behavior? Maybe take a break from commenting and breathe?
trashy,fetdtcu,t1_fesvrt6,1579374343.0,"If you had read the article you'd know she went to go talk to the school and the two girls saw her, ran up to her demanding a fight and jumped her before she was even able to get into the school. Parents have a right to go to their child's school to report bullying and no one has the right to jump anyone for no goddamned reason."
WinStupidPrizes,fepmia0,t3_eq9345,1579324439.0,I went from gasping thinking he died to utter laughter.

crafts,fepg36n,t3_eq9oua,1579319616.0,"Wonderful idea for recycling and material. The only birdhouse I've had that has lasted me over 30 years is my metal one. All wooden ones eroded after time and disappeared off my tree. I love how creative this is. 

Just adding a quick edit to say I saw some of your other posted creations and they are well done and whimsical. Love your work."
crafts,fepfxyj,t3_eq6yjf,1579319512.0,This is actually very lovely. Well done!
gratefuldoe,fenfjnj,t3_eq3bsk,1579283601.0,Both teenagers and both about the same height. Both in Cali with the one girl disappearing in Jan and the remains being found in August same year. It's definitely worth submitting as Kimberly has not been ruled out by comparison on NamUs.

YouShouldKnow,fefjney,t3_eopcpm,1579057727.0,"The Philadelphia SPCA, they will take old blankets, towels, animal toys, leashes, collars, and even let you walk into the shelter to give the animals treats, read to them and spend time talking to them. 

Be sure nothing has loose pieces or pieces that can be easily torn off. They are grateful for all those who come to visit the animals even if they can't take them in. It helps the animals to become people friendly, even the ones that may seem aggressive."
mutt,febywq4,t3_eoalvc,1578964455.0,That is one beautiful and very fluffy dog. Always interesting to see mixed breeds.

My husband told me if I want us to donate or do what we can, fine, but asked me not to look at anymore harsher videos after waking up crying for a few days cuz of that video. There is something so fucking wrong in seeing anything be that helpless in audible and visible anguish. I'm  praying for some hard rain to hit them ASAP."
wholesomegifs,fe4efuj,t1_fe4bvka,1578858408.0,"Wow, one can only hope that is true. Animals are more intelligent than people give them credit. That is a small silver lining. Glad you shared that."
wholesomegifs,fe4bdsh,t1_fe40wed,1578857561.0,"I'll tell you, every time I see anything about Australia and these poor creatures, those who have been risking all to save what they can and humanely put down those who are in agony, firefighters, regular people trying to put smaller fires out, I burst into tears all over again."
