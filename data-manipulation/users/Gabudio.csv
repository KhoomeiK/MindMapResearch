BlackPeopleTwitter,ffdkqko,t1_ffcbdum,1579822946.0,You bet. My grandparents had their side by side graves bought and paid for with a tombstone with names and birthdates carved just waiting for their bodies and death dates.  Grandpa went first and then 15 years later we buried grandma beside him. It always spooked me thinking  those empty graves waiting for them. But that’s what they believed that good folks do for their families.  If grandma had wanted a new spot we would have had an some concern.  But she paid the bills

insanepeoplefacebook,ffcuy0l,t1_ffbtzr8,1579807780.0,I swear we Americans all saw the same piece of misinformation in Autobahn.  It’s always being called THE Autobahn. My understanding was that it was a freeway that ran the length of Germany and being that it had many many lanes and very few exits unusually high speeds were safe. So THE Autobahn has no speed limit.

It is actually somehow a *salad dressing* which isn’t even a category of sandwich/burger spreads. Actual mayonnaise tastes like trash for me. Makes things even more confusing when all joints call it mayo while some actually serve *salad dressing*. So I have to clarify which one they are serving only to find the cashier/waiter doesn’t know the difference. 

So yeah man f*#k the mayo industry. I’m Pro-Salad dressing industry"
books,ff9yiyn,t3_eri8rn,1579724254.0,"The ring was forged for the purpose of enabling Suaron to hack into the ring network. 

The lesser offset each other and balanced powers of their relative races. They were self serving but not having a ring meant being at risk of being at the mercy of a ring. The first lesser ring made the lesser rings a necessary evil.  

Sauron hijacked the ring system and made it a destabilizing force.  It too was self serving but not in service of a race or breed but of total domination.  

The continued reliance on a lesser ring would only contribute to the one ring of Sauron. 

The destruction of a lesser ring had the same effect. If all lesser rings are destroyed that’s the ball game Sauron wins. 

The destruction of the great ring was problematic because once it was possessed by someone it corrupted them enough to prevent them from following through.  

It’s an arms race of sorts. Possessing the ring made the wearer want what Sauron wanted. It didn’t give them the possession of Sauron’s means to actually conquer all."
