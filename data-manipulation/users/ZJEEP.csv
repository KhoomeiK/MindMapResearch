It's literally just showbox.space but with a different URL. The disclaimers and web design at the bottom are identical. 

So, same thing with showbox.space. it's a site created by someone else to impersonate the original showbox APK creators. The app that this subreddit was started on. The (new/or fake) showbox.space has been promoted using multiple reddit accounts to manipulate users views of the website. Regardless of if the website is legit or not. This alone makes it kinda shady. On top of that, its security isnt 100%, and it seems to share or have access to, a lot of your information.

Now the same creator is making a (fake/new) version of the popular Popcorntime app.

At the end of the day though, were trying to stream free shit. So it's always going to come with risks. If this site works for you and you don't care, then you're fine whatever
