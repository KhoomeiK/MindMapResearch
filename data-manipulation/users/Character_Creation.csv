I am 22 and moved put 4 years ago, and I only now see patterns of my parents (unconsciously) playing me out against each other. I got pretty alienated from my father and only now started to genuinely bond again. It‚Äôs been real. These things take time. And if one parent poisons the child with (mis)information it takes a while to get over.

MakeupAddiction,ff6pp55,t1_ff5gv6z,1579632285.0,"Basically, all the places cis women will contour with a darker color to look more angled, you would want to make lighter to look rounder. So putting on some concealer, maybe highlighter for a real pop. You could look up some trans contouring videos, since I'm definitely no expert. For lipstick I'd use a nice matte nude is a little bit darker than your natural lip color.  I think, for example, jeffree star's lipstick ""nathan"" (RIP) would look good. Your brows look really nice as is and I would totally go for bangs! Super feminine and would definitely suit your face! Lastly, I'd finish up with a tiny bit of blush, looks real cute, but less is more. Cheers!"

If I were to have sex with a trans person I would like to know, even if it kinda is non of my business sort of. But then again, it kinda is, because they‚Äôre putting their junk (talking about a trans man ofc, y‚Äôall chill) in me. Idk."
