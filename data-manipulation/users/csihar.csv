anime,ffyiplx,t1_ffxi3vq,1580347369.0,"The new character designer is actually the costume designer for All Stars, so I'd guess they liked how the characters looked in his(?) personal style in concept art, and decided to let him run with it. Just speculation, though."
LoveLive,ffyi9j6,t3_evu82k,1580347068.0,"Well, good luck to you, but since you got taken down once, be aware that it will probably happen again. Japanese record labels really, really don't like people posting their copyrighted material on Youtube for free, and generally don't consider lyric translations to be fair use."
LoveLive,ffuh625,t3_euzja5,1580241860.0,"Let's be clear so there's no misinformation being spread around: there is NO MENTION in the Japanese announcements of this being for a new group. That is purely fan speculation. What we do know is that:

* This is for a new TV anime series.
* One character is being cast at present.
* The announcement has three exclamation points in it.

A lot of the assumptions that this is evidence of a ""new group"" is because of the three exclamation points, which is quite weak evidence. Yes, there is a slight pattern between the one exclamation point in Love Live! and the two in Sunshine!!, but the anime industry tends to use punctuation quite liberally, and let's note that we don't even know the new series' title - the exclamation points are just in the *project title* (equivalent to ""Perfect Dream Project,"" which did not end up becoming the new group's name, or is really used at all anymore officially). It could possibly indicate a third group, or it could just be a way of making it sound more exciting than what's coming before. We just don't know. However, the fact that they explicitly mentioned they're only casting one character seems odd, and like a very deliberate move.

If any of you keep up with Aikatsu!, another idol anime produced by Sunrise, you'll know that the current season, Aikatsu on Parade!, is a multiverse-style crossover between the three previous series (Aikatsu!, Aikatsu Stars!, and Aikatsu Friends!). This series stars a new protagonist who basically acts as a plot device to get the rest of the characters to interact. It's also been quite successful compared to the last season of Aikatsu Friends!, which got bogged down with a weird, gimmicky plot involving new characters that nobody really cared about. Turns out people just really wanted more of their old faves.

Love Live already has All Stars, which has also been extremely successful. That makes it a good candidate for an adaptation. It also has a player insert protagonist who, while unseen and unvoiced, has quite a large role in the game's plot, literally bringing the three schools' characters together and acting as a producer/support role for Nijigasaki. (The almost isekai-like ""self-insert"" quality of the main character is a major draw for Japanese-fluent fans of the game.) If you were to make an anime adaptation, you'd either need to cut protag-chan out completely, or cast her. I thought they'd just go for the first option with the Niji anime, but that doen't mean the second option can't happen as well. Consider that µ's and Aqours already had full anime series; it would make sense to give Niji their own as well, before starting an All Stars adaptation, so you can spend All Stars on interschool hijinks. Love Live has always had a problem fully developing its cast in the time limit of a couple anime seasons, and if Aikatsu on Parade! has shown us anything, it's that making equal screen time for all your old characters leaves a *very* small amount of time for actual plot. For Niji's characters to stand on their own in any way, they'll absolutely need at least one season purely for themselves, before diving into a crossover situation. (Note that the game is different in this way because there's no seasonal time constraint like anime - you can spend as many story chapters as you want establishing Niji alongside appearances from the other groups. But also note that the Niji plot in All Stars is pretty self-contained, with the full club being assembled before µ's and Aqours even come into the picture.)

So, that's why I think this announcement is either for an All Stars adaptation, or something totally new, and NOT a new 9-member group. One final thing to consider is the tagline. The usual Love Live! tagline is ""The story everyone makes."" The new project's tagline literally translates as ""The story that makes me."" This feels like a big shift to me. Whether the new project is All Stars or something different, there's going to be a huge emphasis on the fact that the new character is played by a real Love Live fan, who may be actually be in high school (although let's note that nearly all current Love Live seiyuu would have fit this casting call's age restrictions when they were first cast). After all, *that's one of the keys to why Aqours became so popular* \- they're fans who made it; they're ""one of us."" It would be very smart to continue pursuing this angle. It would also be a good way to shake up a series that's becoming both a bit predictable, and a bit unwieldy; I don't think fans would be very receptive of an entire new group of 9 (18) more girls at this point, so soon after three consecutive series of that formula. In business they call this diminishing returns. It should also be mentioned that the idea that the new series is about ""you, a Love Live fan, becoming a part of Love Live"" - basically, giving a face and seiyuu to the ""anata-chan"" protag from All Stars - is very popular on Japanese Twitter from what I've seen.

**TL;DR:** We don't know much yet and we need to be careful not to take speculation from the Western fanbase as canon. I think there's a strong chance that this is NOT a new full group; rather, a pivot to a new type of Love Live series which emphasizes the fact that the protagonist is played by a Love Live fan who would essentially be an IRL school idol. There are a lot of hints in how this was announced, as well as trends in similar franchises, that point to this using a significantly different formula than the last 3 generations. There are also, just to be clear, no indications whatsoever that this foreshadows an end to Aqours' activities or any other nonsense like that.

EDIT: Aaaand [Anata-chan has been revealed](https://twitter.com/LL_Wikia/status/1222325830161842176). I don't think there's been any confirmation or denial whether this new project or casting call has to do with her or not, so I guess we'll just have to wait and see."

Maybe I'm just jaded from going to a bazillion concerts over the years, but really doesn't feel like being in the audience for an actual show to me, it just feels like a bunch of nerds hooting and hollering at a movie screen, so the crowd doesn't really add much for me. I'm just there for the big screen and big speakers man."

LoveLive,ff7pd9t,t1_ff2w42i,1579655095.0,"Let's not forget that Mimorin and Jolno are in the running as well. I think those two plus Kyan, Nya, and King make a pretty killer top 5 that I refuse to rank further out of principle."
LoveLive,ff2l54x,t3_equx8t,1579511252.0,"Just for context, ""project"" can mean any number of different things with Love Live. Anywhere from a new group (Perfect Dream Project), to a vague theme connecting a set of live appearances and song releases (Hop! Step! Jump! Project). So this could either be huge, or just basically ""Love Live is still alive and here are some future plans for our existing groups"", or anywhere in between."
