AskReddit,ffuya2n,t1_ffuk8o0,1580251649.0,"Absolutely. My parents have never apologized once, if they realize they were wrong like this guy did they’d try to turn it into some sort of life lesson like “I know it may have SEEMED like I was being hostile and abusive for no good reason, but really that’s just your fault for not understanding. Don’t worry, it’s ok that you don’t understand! It’s all part of growing up!” 
if they were the type to just say sorry when they’ve realized they were wrong we’d be closer. Like I’m 35 and these things STILL stand between us being as close as they’d like"

TheExpanse,ffs4gs2,t1_ffs41y4,1580172902.0,"I agree completely! That’s exactly what I’m wondering! Was it romantic love, or plutonic love? As a person, I don’t feel like it matters. And as an audience member of the show I don’t feel like it matters. It’s just that as someone who would like to learn how to be a writer and write interesting characters, I’d like to know exactly what the writers are hiding between the lines. Because maybe then I could learn something and then I could write a little bit better.  Maybe I could learn something about hiding realistic characteristics between the lines, like how people in real life are.

How do you write a relationship between two interesting characters that makes the audience interested in their connection? Maybe if I can figure out exactly what’s going on between Naomi and Drummer, maybe I’ll be one step closer to answering that question"

So you pull up an app on your phone and it scans your face and you can swipe through options to see exactly what certain hair cuts and beard styles will look like on you. When you find the one you want you swipe up kind of like when people throw videos from their phones to their TVS, but instead at this time your phone thing is just pointed at the clippers and now your selected hair cut is programmed into it. Drag those clippers all around your dome and it’ll perfectly cut each hair how long it should be to make the hair cut you picked out perfectly. Can also die hair.
