HistoryMemes,fevjznq,t1_fev3tm2,1579398273.0,"That's pretty aggressive, a better response would be that it's just straight up wrong lol. Only gladiators didn't die much cause it was expensive to pay for them. Even then many died if the public demanded it or the emperor forced it. Prisoners of war, slaves, criminals were all killed regularly in spectacle.

Part of the construction of a spectacle specifically includes executions as a pastime between the morning beast hunts and the afternoon gladiatorial battles culminating in one on one combat between famous gladiators of the highest rank. The idea was to always have excitement throughout the day. The executions of these slaves were made dramatic, including several descriptions of bulls made to rape women to parallel mythology in a ""comedic"" fashion.

This was in Rome, in the provinces there's evidence to suggest blunt weapons were used to save on cost and lesser gladiators were ""rented"" instead of better ones. This was because local nobles would have to pay for the spectacle to keep their rank and as a sort of tax on the rich. Even then slaves were sometimes brought in for the sole purpose of executions.

Overall there were tons of deaths in gladiatorial spectacle. It's just wrong to say there wasn't because gladiators didn't die as often as depicted in modern media. Just overlooking slave deaths is disingenuous and misleading."

As for species dying it may not affect you in the short term, but it will affect our entire planet in the long-term. As species die out climate change becomes even worse. Waiting for something to happen to you personally is pretty ignorant when things are already happening to others (islands flooding, Venice flooding, ice caps melting, fires in Alberta, fires in California, fires in Australia, temperatures rising globally, European heat wave, africa overheating and becoming even more dried out, it's only a matter of time before you feel it too).

The media does indeed manipulate things, but it's not only the media who's saying this. The government reports across many countries say the same thing, international organizations on climate change, with their most conservative and best case scenarios, say the same thing. Fleets of reputable researchers, professors, doctors and other scientists say the same thing.

At some point it becomes hard to deny, and I think dismissing all of this is a fool's errand."

I think that lecture puts things into perspective. Appreciate what's around you right now before the inevitable collapse, but also don't be too sad when things go to shit. I guess there's a tiny chance that some earth shattering discovery will change things but that seems... Unlikely.

That's just as much a religious idea as well, by the way, but I don't know how that's relevant here. Thought I'd mention it to show you why that's not a valid argument you can use in this discussion.  


> It doesn't matter if someone consciously decided to rape of if they acted according to the biological machines they are.  
> 

Considering people can change opinions, change on their experiences, become better or worse over time etc. It's really really hard for me to believe that we're all hardwired to act a certain way.

> We still are responsible for our behavior. No matter why, if you are the cause of something you are responsible for it.  
> 

It actually does matter if someone consciously decided to rape or is acting according to their biological makeup. Once more the argument that people are still responsible for their behaviour goes against what you said. How can you hold anyone accountable when they have no free will? He didn't CHOOSE to rape, that's just what he does, according to you. In that sense alone, holding anyone accountable requires their free will and ability to make conscious decisions.

Alright, now to the brain stuff:

> But at the same time you will basically describe religion, because you have to think that our brains magically work different than the physical world around us.

For the first quote there, our brains don't need to ""magically work"" in order to be extremely complex. Just because you don't understand them doesn't make them as drab as the world you've built in your head. In actuality, for the very reason you point out, I'm inclined to believe we do act consciously because of how complex everything in the universe is, rather than the opposite. Your interpretation that our brains can't be complex because the world around us isn't just shows how little you know of the world around us.

> There were cases of people who did things because of changes in their brain (cancer or injury). That is proven.  
> 

What in the world does this prove, or for that matter disprove, anything? You're literally just stating a fact. Yes, there are cases where this happens, it is well known the brain is connected to who we are and why we act in certain ways which, if damaged or tampered with, can change. Are you trying to say we are biologically programmed like drones to behave in a certain way? Because if that's the case once more you can't blame anyone for anything. Hey Hitler wasnt a terrible guy he was just programmed that way. Are you saying tampering with our brains and causing different behaviours accordingly proves that we're all biologically programmed into actions? 

Alright this seems to be an idea you throw around a lot so let's put a scenario up just for the fun of it: A man has to work relentlessly to make ends meet and is constantly having backpains from his overworking. Yet still, he finds time to help those in need because he experienced being at the lowest ends of society as a child.

In your own terms, the man's experience would not change who he is because he was biologically programmed into giving to the poor. But what does that really mean? You're saying a man can wake up at age 40 having no previous experience yet still act as though he has because he's programmed to? That's ridiculous. It doesn't make sense. And if he does change with experiences wouldn't that show that he's consciously making decisions? Decisions like helping the poor?

Despite them going against his biological needs, he still chooses to help, this goes against your theory, where everyone's actions are determined by their needs and preprogrammed unconscious actions. The more I explain it the less it makes sense.

> Let's call this braincase B. If a rapist has NOT a reason like this, so never had an injury or cancer or anything, this just means that they were born as braincase B.

And finally the most bullshit statement on here. Rapists don't mean it!!!! He didnt hold her to the ground and forcefully penetrate her after stalking her on purpose that's just who he is!!!! I'm not even gonna expand or give logical reasoning here because it's pretty clear how fucked up that is.

Your ideas are not only dumb, nonsensical and lacking in almost every way, they're dangerous. You are excusing any form of hurting others by saying those people are just biologically programmed that way what can ya do. If your idea allows rapists, murderers, pedophiles and every other piece of shit on this earth to roam freely because ""that's just who they are!"" It's time to reconsider your idea."

Not to mention that despite you saying it isn't okay, according to your own definition it would be okay to cheat because cheating is breaking someone's trust, which isn't actually a thing when humans can't even make decisions consciously. Trusting is a decision made consciously and therefore isn't really made.
