Then you should shut the fuck up since you're clearly unqualified to speak on the topic. 

As someone who's witnessed suicide by fire, I saw the regret and change of heart when they did it. It happens to all people during suicide attempts."

They were my go-to for two years straight but this year I though their flower quality tanked and I started exploring other options. I found a dispensary with some [good bud](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZK5xY9k) I really like but it's clear across town. They have their own issues, like product shortages but their top shelf beats every other dispensary I've tried so far. Back to Starbuds, they're okay and IL actually has standards that products have to meet whereas in CO it's way more loose and [there's a lot of bad product out on the market](https://www.westword.com/marijuana/in-random-mold-tests-80-percent-of-denver-marijuana-dispensaries-fail-11467203). I would be confident in trying them in Illinois if I ever went back though because of those higher standards. And I did just spend $200 on an ounce there today so there's that. What I like about starbuds is that they're ""deli style"" and you can mix and match and they weigh it out in front of you. Lightshade is like buying video games at TRU in the 90s where you look at a display, pay, and take a ticket to a window where they actually dispense product."
