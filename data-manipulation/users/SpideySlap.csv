Preventative care is cheaper than reactive care. One of the reasons single payer is cheaper is because people don't wait til something is seriously wrong to seek treatment.

I'm sorry but you're critically misinformed about healthcare in the US. You really need to look at the side by side comparisons with the US and the rest of the developed world. Our healthcare system sucks and it's because we let a lot of private entities leech off your tax dollar and ultimately not follow through on their promises to you.
