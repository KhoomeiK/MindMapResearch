worldnews,fdiizav,t1_fdiijhw,1578443977.0,"The Donald syndrome isnt a thing. You are reaching to defend your putrid idiot of a president. I didnt say Iran had no agency here but Trump's order to kill Soleimani was foolish war mongering, and threatening Iran's cultural sites constitutes threatening war crimes. This is a strategic mistake on an epic scale and it risks potentially thousands of lives to stroke his ego and distract from his legal troubles."

glasgow,fdbcsyf,t3_ekiaj5,1578256105.0,"I did! I went through an abusive marriage and when I escaped I decided to change my life, so I quit my job and went to university in my late 20s. While it meant a few really tough years financially speaking, it was the first time I'd ever really done something just for myself. Since I graduated I moved and got a job that I truly love using my degree. 

A word of caution- it does feel great to be brave but the financial struggle is really really hard. 

The best thing I've done is go through intensive therapy. That's been a game changer for how I feel about myself and what I'm looking for in life. Might be an idea to connect with a professional and get some support. You've been through a lot and theres no shame in finding someone to talk through it all with."
