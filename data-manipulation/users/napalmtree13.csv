I didn’t like her. She was mean, catty, and loved to gossip. But it made me realize even people you consider to be awful people can do the right thing/be nice. I also realized that if *she* could be kind in that instance, then I needed to be at *least* that kind to others."

vegan,fdnhptr,t3_em852s,1578586046.0,"I went pescatarian after reading an article about pigs rescued from a factory farm being tracked down by the FBI. I’d been vegetarian before then and knew deep down eating meat was wrong, but tried to ignore those feelings because I didn’t want to inconvenience friends/family. Then I read that article and finally decided enough was enough.

I went vegetarian a few months later for consistency.

My husband remarked that a carton of eggs said it saved male chickens. I was confused because I didn’t know why they needed saving. Him saying that made me finally look into what happens to male chicks.

I also didn’t realize that cows had to keep having babies to produce milk. I thought they could have one baby and then keep producing like humans. So I thought organic milk was ok.

So, looking into the egg industry made me look into the dairy industry. Then I watched an  Earthling Ed video about why he went vegan. For some reason watching Okja the next day made me decide I was going vegan. I know it’s about a pig but for some reason that did it for me. I think I would have gone vegan within a week or two even if I hadn’t watched Okja, but that movie made me transition faster.

Long version: I unsubbed recently from vci and veganforcirclejerkers. Some of the posts there were making me more misanthropic than usual, including towards friends and family. I never took it out on them, but I definitely had regular thoughts about how they're all animal abusers, selfish assholes destroying the planet, etc. Especially when they would say insanely dumb shit like, ""I need animal protein"" or ""the vegan burger smells like cat food.""

Anyway, I initially did feel a little better after leaving those subs, but after attending a few ""climate talks"" at a conference I was at recently, including one from Extinction Rebellion, I'm back to feeling totally annoyed/angry with everyone. None of those speakers mentioned how important going vegan is for the environment. Hell, they didn't even say people should stop flying and having kids. It was a ""shit's fucked"" talk and that's it. Great. How fucking helpful.

I don't know how to deal with my growing dislike and annoyance with non-vegans and, to a lesser extent, people who think the fact that they sort their recycling (which we all have to do where I live...) is peak environmentalism.

It's especially hard since I don't really know any other vegans IRL. I'm also not living in my native country, and while my German is decent, I'm not fluent by any means yet.

Veganism is about reducing harm as much as possible. Everyone eats fruits and veggies; or, at least, they should be. So even if this were true, it wouldn’t matter; being vegan reduces your harm more than being a non-vegan.

It’s the same with the bs “plants feel pain” argument. Plants don’t have a central nervous system. They don’t feel pain. But even if they did feel pain, most crops are actually grown for animal feed, including soy. Humans have to eat something. So if you’re really worried about plants, then being vegan means your diet actually uses fewer plants since you aren’t eating living beings that also need to eat plants."

I’m all for encouragement, but I’m never going to pat someone on the back for reduction unless they’re on a clear path to transition fully. And there’s no other fight for rights/against injustices I can think of where people are expected to grovel with thanks over baby steps. You want to end violence against women, for example...not have “Beat-free Mondays”.

Yet because it’s “just” animals, I guess we’re supposed to smile and praise baby steppers.
