ladyladyboners,feecf3a,t3_eokdi4,1579030878.0,Saw her in a concert last year and there was a lesbian proposal on stage :)
bipolar,feafhpw,t3_eo9gbq,1578948071.0,This hits too close. Iâ€™m really sorry and I wish I knew how to help but maybe you find a bit of comfort in knowing that weâ€™re both lonely together. Adopting a cat is helping me but isnâ€™t enough unfortunately.
CPTSD,fdercmt,t3_ekyvo9,1578345002.0,"Like you said, fuck anyone who tells you to ignore the importance of having a support system. Weâ€™re tribal animals and youâ€™re not supposed to go through this alone. I agree with the comment wondering if your therapist is trauma informed cause if theyâ€™re they definitely shouldnâ€™t be saying this. Iâ€™m sorry itâ€™s like this. Being/feeling alone and lonely definitely sucks. For me and a lot of others adopting a cat or a pet in general has been a great help tbh, mine even had her adoption fees waived so I pretty much didnâ€™t have to pay for anything other than her food, litter, and litterbox at first. I hope it gets better for us and we find people who care about us as much as weâ€™ve been solely caring about ourselves..."
weed,fcsh8qq,t1_fcr2riy,1577916517.0,hm I see your point but wanted to put this out herr: I have cptsd and know that weed that gives me a sativa effect is better for me and for a lot of other cptsd folks (I think someone also mentioned it in the comments). the weed experience is fairly personal tbh.
CPTSD,fcnq6hd,t3_ei5658,1577816349.0,I used to get the same symptoms two weeks before my period. I have bipolar as well and my mood swings are the worst at that time (mostly a mixed state/very rapid cycling). My doctor put me on a combination birth control pill for the PMDD/PCOS (I only take the active pills not the placebos so I skip periods). My life has been much better ever since.
uofmn,fcljzwh,t3_ehqo4e,1577749573.0,It was fairly slippery near the east bank station when I was there an hour ago.
CPTSD,fci4xm0,t1_fci3om7,1577657827.0,"Iâ€™d say do it if you feel like it can help (but try to avoid doing it often). I understand that sometimes weâ€™re so (rightfully) upset and itâ€™s hard to imagine being okay again, but you worked hard and thatâ€™s not gonna be for nothing. Is there anything that can help or anything I can offer to help?"
bipolar,fci3x1z,t3_eharcg,1577657475.0,"Unfortunately I do recognize it. Like another comment mentioned it could be a form of dissociation. I try to focus on some physical sensations that Iâ€™m experiencing (petting my cat and feeling how soft she is/her weight against my lap, lying in a bath...etc) which is similar to a lot of grounding/meditation exercises that may help"
CPTSD,fci3cib,t3_ehbjo0,1577657270.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry you had to go through that. Hope youâ€™re better now. If you can, try to just sit down and focus on breathing in and exhaling slowly from your mouth. Sometimes intrusive thoughts still pop up in your head, but forcing myself to empty my mind + convincing myself that thereâ€™s absolutely nothing I should be doing/nowhere I should be now works. Another thing that can help is lying down in a half-filled bath so that your ears are under water and closing your eyes. Youâ€™ve gotten through worse things and I believe you can get through this. Stay safe and take care ðŸ’œ"
bipolar2,fcb2ffy,t3_egupz8,1577581413.0,This used to happen to me two weeks before every period. My doctor put me on the birth control combination pill and now I skip periods. My mood is much more stable
cats,fc6xqk4,t1_fc6nh8l,1577492205.0,purrfessional
NonBinary,fc2szaq,t3_efsz4q,1577373155.0,I personally prefer dyke. Even tho itâ€™s still gendered it feels more butch to me at least
bipolar,fc2adbm,t3_efmpxr,1577348447.0,"Exactly my night. Youâ€™re not alone, weâ€™re in this together and I hope it gets better soon."
LesbianActually,fc28olv,t3_efrpn1,1577345749.0,right here! (not originally minnesotan but I go to the U)
NonBinary,fc1emxh,t3_eflydy,1577316473.0,If itâ€™s any comfort you still look pretty androgynous! youâ€™ll be invincible after the surgery :)
uofmn,fbz0g2y,t3_ef7eor,1577231392.0,"No, certainly not for everyoneâ€”and thatâ€™s okay. You have a full lifetime ahead, just take care of yourself first and enjoy it as it goes"
bipolar,fbiuqv5,t3_edmlgq,1576915231.0,love the abaya touch
