A bond does not just happen through chance.  You have forged that with Phoebe using your own time and your care for her.  When you think of what time and care people have for each other, you will then realise what a wonderful thing it is you have for Phoebe and for everybody else that you then have time for.  The goal then is to share that nurturing gift with others, when you are feeling up to it.

It took me along time to even learn TIME!  Seriously, 12 hour and 24 hour time took a long time to understand, and I think I still probably take longer to work out a clock face than the average person but I am not going around asking people this, of course.  One of my early school memories (primary 2, so, like, I think that is 6 years old) was struggling with a sum and being held back by my relentless teacher until my dad stood outside the classroom and had to butt in to tell her to leave me alone so we could go home.  


I hate math.  I respect it but I also know my place when it comes to it.  We do not get along.  I have tried to understand it again with an Open University module but I am most likely going to drop out or fail.  £u<k.  Sake.  


Thank you for bringing this up though.  I am just going through my assessment interviews and I think this 'not being a math prodigy' went against me.  The fact that and I am very freaking average intelligence and there is nothing that I excel at, I think, has probably shot me right in the foot.  Is there any autists who are not RAINMAN!?

I live alone in the apartment I own and I love it, however I think I would appreciate a house now.

So when viewing flats go several times at different times of the day in order to see whether the neighbours/surroundings are noisy.

AutisticAdults,fezbfoc,t1_fez4i7v,1579455679.0,"This makes a bit more sense to me now.  I have had many obsessions throughout my life, my home is a graveyard for these past passions.  I started out loving Ancient Egypt and wanting to be an Egyptologist, then fashion designer (I still have my dummy, sewing machine and overlocker), and anything and everything to do with the French - they are awesome, okay!?  Haha! 

  
In time I find that I can look at these things, remember the love and obsession I had for them but when I look at them in a present sense I just... see them.  There is no more attachment except memory.  This is fine.  It is time to move on.  

I used to wonder why I did not feel love for them anymore and whether I was broken because of it.  Actually, I think I just exhausted my attention span with them.  And like I have said, it is fine, it is time to move on.  This is a healthy thing and people do this all the time and when you can accept it for what it is it can become a strength.

There is still room to visit these passions again, when the time is right.  Like when I meet someone who is just going through their own passionate phase of something I used to love, say Egypt.  And I can feel the fires burn again as I talk to them and share knowledge and memories with them.  It may spurn me on to revisit them when home but otherwise I just find a new hobby.  There is a world out there filled with other things that will make you excited to be alive in this moment again.

So instead of hunkering down with a week grocery shop of junk food, and scoffing it within one night (sweet lucifer), I am now down to 'caving into' a bowl or two of cereal.  All bran btw so... quite the turnaround, eh?! Haha

I do not know if you want any tips, I may have unload more than you would even care to read but some of the stuff that has helped me is to eat dried apricots for the sweet and chewiness, a pinch (or grab, more like) of all-bran cereal (or whatever cereal suits you), and any veg.

In the end, I do not think you are a loser at all.  I think you would just benefit from meeting/talking to someone who has similar interests.

In the more corporate workplace I still wore, like yourself, OP, leggings with black Timberland boots, and a 'smart' top.  However, I also stashed away a pair of comfortable flat shoes (Gabor is a fab brand) in order to wear chinos with smart tops, and dresses.  

I will now and then wear heels too, so I would recommend a thick heel so that they are comfortable and should enable you to still keep your quick pace if you have one.  I suggest this as there is nothing I find more frustrating than wearing something that I find stifling or that will stop me from operating naturally but I can also be vain and wish to 'look the part'.  I hope this helps.

Like another poster has commented, this company has hired you as you are.  The appearance is a very small part in the role, it is what you actually DO that is important.  If you are comfortable and can work well then you will be so much more vital and appreciated than all the other staff members if what they can bring to the table is being 'Suits' like."

Autistic,fejk1ge,t1_fejh3yp,1579177457.0,"No, they are aware.  Both me and the guy confirmed we can hear each other flats noise when he passed me a parcel about a year or so ago.  They can hear my music and I confirmed that I mostly played music because I could hear them.  This was still a pleasant enough exchange but I was firm so I would hope that he would have understood that I would not have to play it if they quietened down too.  I am learning to speak more plainly and not to leave anything up to assumptions as I am often misconstrued & misconstruing!

As for the lass, she has recently spoken to me about it, just before Christmas, and this was after I had started to shout up to 'shut up'.  She apologised for the noise, admitted that there were two more people at their flat for a while and that was that.  She did not say that they would quieten down, which is what I should have asked but at the time I was so stressed I just said 'thank you'.  I could have just broken down in tears at that moment so I did not want to stay around to give her a right good show which she may very well relish.  Later that night, and almost every night since (even after the two extra bodies have gone) there is a lot of noise.  Just on the night of this original post I could hear them shouting (not to me but each other).  So I can understand that there may be stress they themselves are struggling with but this should not be brought down upon my head too.  

I should have clarified that I was requesting advice that stayed away from personal contact for the very real possibility it could become a personal conflict.  I am not the best at controlling my emotions, especially when I feel like I am being wronged.  I may as well mount up on a horse and slay them right then and there, because I ain't coming down until they know that I am right.    

Though please do not get me wrong, I appreciate your input and you are right that they may not be aware of just how this is affecting me and my health.  However I am not formally diagnosed and do not want to peg myself as an autistic person until I know.  This is out of respect for actual autistic people rather than worrying what other people might think, I do not want to go tagging myself with it and then go apeshit.  If I am not autistic, then I just give everyone else a bad name - and I'll need to chase up GPs for another route of psychoanalysis.

I would also like to point out that I also think the chances of them becoming volatile is realistically low.  I am not someone who wants to hurt anyone, I just cannot trust myself.  I do not feel confident talking to them about something like this when I cannot be sure of the outcome.  Sorry for the long message - in fairness it is decently quiet right now, and though I have had little sleep due to stress and their elephantine stomps this mornings waking me up(!), I am enjoying the brief respite from them and can actually think a little better.

Not too ridiculous of an assumption for a first episode and considering there's Henry Cavill in the series - I just thought it was going to have some big names throughout, and also who doesn't have love for that lass?"

If so, then you are most likely correct, and I have just never taken proper account to it.  I do not go out as much now, but when I have gone it must not have been in football/rugby/cricket/orwhathaveyou season.  Sorry for the lapse in memory, though I am scatterbrained at the best of times, haha!"

Edinburgh,fdobpad,t3_elze5j,1578602281.0,"I'm pretty sure The Last Word in Stockbridge would fit all of those requirements.  However I cannot confirm 4 and 6, whenever I have went it was quiet but it was either just opening and also summer (so didn't expect the fire to on).  If you live close by to the area then it's always worth a wee deek.  In fact, I would expect most, if not all pubs in Stockbridge to be at least cosy and dog friendly.  I can certainly confirm that The Stockbridge Tap does not have a TV, which I also appreciated, and rather amiable staff.  They have a small fireplace but not sure whether it is lit and it can get busy."
