writing,fckxzbv,t1_fckmg2m,1577735601.0,"I was going to recommend this as well. I'm not usually that interested in YA titles, but the Lockwood & Co. books have been a lot of fun. I purchased them as gifts for some of my friends' YA-aged kids and they were a big hit. I got into the horror genre when I was still in elementary school (read some things I definitely shouldn't have at that age). But there you go; kids like the scary stuff too."

They recommended I only read until there's a ""significant shift in perspective"" and then stop."

aww,fc91nov,t1_fc8lydv,1577545584.0,"It's like with wolves. They respond to the sounds because it's a pack instinct. It isn't anxiety that causes it, but the instinct to be social and communicate. Other wolves howling sets them off, or similar sounds like a siren, or a saxophone, or Aunt Dorothy's high pitch whining can do it. They howl to let other pack members know where they are and to let unfamiliar wolves know they're in someone else's territory. And if they're like my dog, they howl to tell you they're glad you're home but damn it it's dinner time and you'd better make good with the kibble and scritches.

rainworld,fbyi1yh,t3_ef4ybd,1577217416.0,"We had a microburst directly over my office in 2017. My stupid ass, without considering the potential dangers, thought it was amazing and decided to go out into it to experience the chaos. While the rain wasn't what you'd call ""bullet-like,"" it was certainly enough to soak me through in about a second flat. We lost a lot of trees and power poles in the area. An 80 foot evergreen came down on the far side of our parking lot about 150 feet away from where I was (narrowly missing several cars). I neither saw nor heard any of this happen, because the rain and wind was so loud and thick."
