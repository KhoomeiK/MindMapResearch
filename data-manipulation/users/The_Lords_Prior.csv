genetics,ffmi8w4,t1_ffkolmh,1580055062.0,"Even within a single population, environmental diversity could still be a major driving force for maintaining phenotypic diversity. Humans in particular are famously capable of exploiting all kinds of niches, so a single population could remain highly variable if that population exists in a place with many different types of niches that could be exploited.  

Of course, we definitely need to keep in mind that we're not as sensitive to differences in the facial features of other animals, but that's something that could easily be overcome with objective measurements (literally measuring size/shape differences, sequencing genomes, etc.)."

Unlike many aquarium species, betta in particular have highly variable personalities. So some bettas are super aggressive toward any tankmates and some are super passive. In general, the most well-behaved bettas are (a) female, (b) purchased as juveniles,  and (c) raised in community tanks. Males who matured alone are the most risky in terms of aggression. 

That said, its still worth a try. The betta in my tank is a female because I really didn't want to deal with the possibility of aggression. In your case, its totally fine to experiment and see if your male betta will be nice in the endler tank, but don't try this experiment unless you can watch the tank for a few hours. He'll probably be nice to adult endlers, but be ready to react if you notice him being an asshole.

Of course, all bettas will eat the fry, so make sure you're OK with showing your students that kinda thing. Some people are really bothered by that."
genetics,ffjd1qz,t3_etwy4o,1579995722.0,"Despite the fact that other commenters seem to think this assumption is obviously false, I think this is a very interesting and legitimate question. Reasonable people can disagree about whether humans are more phenotypically variable than most species, so until you see a proper peer-reviewed analysis I would not let anybody persuade you to abandon curiosity about this question.

Insofar as we are highly diverse, the overarching cause is likely to be *environmental diversity*. I mean, the most obvious example is skin-tone and variation in latitude (i.e., less pigment in populations toward the poles), but other significant environmental features will play a role as well. Other examples include differences in exposure to different pathogens, available food sources, predators, etc. All of these things could lead to an increase in the diversity of a species. On the flip-side, the main reason why a species might look less diverse is because all of the populations of that species are constrained to similar environments (e.g., chimps in the jungles of Africa).

Also, I've found that using a UV filter can really smooth out the acclimation process in terms of disease control. All of our tanks have their own unique profile of endemic diseases, but a UV filter keeps the pathogen load low enough for newcomers to adapt. It doesn't keep it at *zero*, but it does keep it low enough for them to develop immunity without being overwhelmed by infections.

technology,femvmwz,t3_epufze,1579270804.0,"I'm sure Dorsey is aware of the problem of bots and I'm sure he'd love to be able to patent a reliable Turing test.

However, from a machine learning perspective this is not an easy problem to solve, especially if you also want to identify paid trolls (who are far more difficult to identify). The big issue is going to be obtaining an accurately coded dataset to train the model. If humans have a hard time reliably identifying bots and trolls (which is certainly true), then you can't really know how well a model is learning to distinguish between the different groups.

If the people who code the training dataset are even slightly more likely to label a conservative account as a bot or a troll, then the models will inevitably tend to mis-classify conservative human accounts as bots or trolls. In other words, **the models will learn to act like *the people* who coded the original training set and this is a major problem when there is no known way to reliably measure the outcome you're trying to predict.**

Honestly, Twitter simply needs to give users more tools for curating their own feeds instead of trying to come up with one-size-fits-all curation methods.

Axolotls are actually a salamander that doesn’t mature into its terrestrial, air-breathing form (“neotenic”). Almost all of them live their lives as aquatic axolotl, but sometimes a trigger in the environment (possibly combined with genetic predisposure) will cause one of them to mature in its adult form and leave the water for a terrestrial life. That said, natural selection seems to be nicer to the ones who stay aquatic."

However, the open face means that it if you are *really careful* the succulents will do just fine. You just need to make sure that you water *sparingly* and never so much that the bottom layer collects water. In addition, give the terrarium as much light as possible. High amounts of light will increase evaporation (which is good) and growth, both of which will help the terrarium dry out."

If we avoid a death from injury long enough whatever does end up killing us is likely to have a genetic component and as technology progresses we're going to get better and better at identifying those risks.

Fast forward 1000 years and you could have the healthiest genome in the world and still get ""bad news"" from a genetic test saying that you'll likely die of X disease. 

This isn't advice against getting tested. I'm also not saying that there aren't some genes out there that aren't especially bad. Its just a reminder that we're all carrying lots of bad mutations and that finding out you have a ""bad gene"" doesn't mean anything on its own. If you find out that you have a mutation that is associated with some disease, make sure to listen to your genetic counselor because they should be able to tell you what that means. Ask this exact question: ""Out of 100 people who have this same gene, how many with DIE of the disease?"". This will give you an idea of how much you should care about the result. Again, don't ask about how many people will GET the disease, ask how many people will DIE of it (which is almost always a smaller number)."
