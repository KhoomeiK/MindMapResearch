BMWE36,ff2uchk,t3_erb5bw,1579524495.0,"You have the OBDI style charcoal cannister if its in the engine bay, even if the rest of your car is OBDII.

In the OBDII version, the cannister is in the trunk, but to switch is a hassle as you have to change the fuel vent lines.

This device is only used to filter out fuel vapors that expand in your tank. A lot of old forums talk about just snipping the blue line that feeds the cannister at the back of the car. That way, when driving the smell won't be inside the car. So basically you don't need it, but you also need to plug the vaccumm that is usually connected to the front charcoal cannister"

BMWE36,femahgm,t1_fem8eig,1579245983.0,"No prob. So every gas 4 stroke engine has basically the same requirements to run. 

First is intake, which requires clean filtered air and make sure nothing dead is stuck in the airbox. You want to make sure from the intake box to the throttle body, the rubber is flexible and not cracked. Then make sure all misc. rubber vaccumm hoses are connected, like the back of the valve cover there is a pcv breather hose and your intake manifold had a hose to your brake booster. If they are cracked or broken, replace them.

Second is fuel, when you turn your key to the run position before the start, you should hear a humming sound for a second from the back seat. This means your fuel pump is priming to start the fuel injectors. If you don't hear it or it's leaking somewhere, then you might have a fuel delivery problen.

Third is compression, which starts with the help of a starter. When you crank your engine and it sounds strong, then you obviously don't have a starter problem or a battery problem. If you did, then you can always look at the battery first to see the voltage on it.

Fourth is ignition, which are your spark plugs. These plugs should get changed every 60k miles or so. Usually you won't have all 4 plugs die on you, and you'll can be running the engine with 3 cylinders which would run very rough. You can always replace these and tell a lot when you inspect them. Try to look for any engine oil that seeped into the spark plug holes, and then look at the spark plugs themselves. Look at pictures online for reference.

Fifth is exhaust, which isn't that important to starting the car. But it delivers the exhaust through your catalytic converters which your engine's ecu will adjust the fuel trim for best emission levels. You want to make sure nothing is clogging the exhaust pipe as well.


But from the video and what I'm guessing, your car can crank and sounds strong, it tries to starts where you can start to hear the revs increasing in sound, indicating something is compressing and firing to add to the starter motor cranking. But then you hear this fluttering sound and it dies out. That fluttering sound is what I'm guessing to be a vaccumm leak because the engine is trying to maintain a constant positive pressure. So check the valve cover and intake manifold hoses. 


Good luck"
