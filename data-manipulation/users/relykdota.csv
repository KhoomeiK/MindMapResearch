atheism,ffiz2ag,t1_ffixw4j,1579986252.0,"I'll preface my response with: I like you. A lot. You don't back down. You stand for what you believe in (talking about values not spiritually). Not sure how old you are, but if you're young, you're gonna go far son.

You're correct, it's almost guaranteed what we believe about the material and the spiritual have been explored before. That's not what I was referring to though. Generally, Redditors have a very hivemind/groupthink mentality. Get into subs about religion or politics and it becomes beyond toxic. And that's fine, don't enter into the hornet's nest if you aren't ready to be stung, right? I will admit I subscribed you to the default role that most people in here share - toxic groupthink. But, after your last reply I'm pretty sure I'm wrong. And for that I apologize.

I think you're still hungry for truth and you seem to refuse to fully buy into any group. Sure atheism is the closest to what you believe - only that which you can physically experience you believe. And that's why you like their tribe. But I would imagine there's a bit of you who is still willing to admit you don't know what you don't know, and I admire people who are open-minded like that.

As far as ""having faith"", I mean exactly what you think faith means. Most atheists who wholesale believe in the groupthink vehemently deny the existence of the super natural - this would be a belief, as spirituality and non-material things cannot be tested for or observed in a traditional scientific method approach and thus 'proving' them becomes impossible. That's why I call it a faith, your faith is simply there is nothing else."
atheism,ffixe77,t1_ffix1jr,1579985050.0,"Son if you think being an atheist means you have no faith, well I've got news for you. Your *belief* is there is no super natural. Which is totally fine to believe.

The only true form of non-faith is agnosticism, where you admit you don't know, believe, or care to think about anything. There could be a God. There could be multiple Gods. There couple be giant lizard man who is going to consume our souls in fire. Or the material could be all there is.

Anyway, enjoy your groupthink mentality. It must be quite fun going through life with such a strict and structured belief system.

P.S. I'm not sounding like a dick to be cool, I just always sound like a dick because I cba to have fake sympathy for people anymore. I recognize I'm a jackass and I'm fine with that."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffiw4v3,t1_ffivbgu,1579984140.0,"He's definitely the one we (as a nation) deserved. The people who founded what is America today gave their lives for complete and utter freedom - a concept that was quite foreign at the time. No longer would a monarch decide what was law, it would be done by the people and for the people. These ideals flowed through the life blood of all Americans at the time, from the humble farmer to rich plantation owner. When it came time to stand and fight for what was rightfully theirs, everyone was willing to risk everything. The men, women, and children who looked death in the face and refused to stand down from what they believed in shows us these were truly noble and authentic pursuits. Those people who were not afraid to stand up to injustice, who desired freedom for all men (remember at this time slave weren't really viewed as men unfortunately), they deserved a leader who was going to give that to them. And that leader was Washington.

Do we today deserve him? No. We don't. We act as though we stand for freedom, but too many times when it comes to standing on a battlefield, rich man, poor man, gay man, straight man, we refuse to help out brothers out. We have forgotten the very ideals our founders fought and died for. We've lost our way as the greatest nation ever known to mankind. But I have not lost faith in us just yet, I think with a strong leader we can resume our pursuit of true freedom. We need a Washington revival."
atheism,ffij1qb,t1_ffiix8r,1579975047.0,That's exactly how I would expect a groupthink individual to respond. Substituting one faith based group identity for another isn't doing him any justice. Just because you need to identify as part of the atheist faith to feel secure doesn't mean he should too.
atheism,ffig9t1,t3_etql8g,1579973160.0,"What in the actual fuck? You lack critical thinking skills not because of your religious upbringing, but because you are clearly just ignorant.

Tattoos links back to Leviticus. All old rule is broken through Jesus. In fact, Jesus says ""There is no sin, but it is you who make sin when you do the things that are like the nature of adultery, which is called sin."" So if you get a tattoo symbolizing your allegiance to a hate group or something like that, you've now immortalized your 'sin', but the tattoo itself was not the 'sin'.

Fucking religious half breeds like yourself are the reason people who pursue the Truth get such a bad rap. You grow up on old school doctrines without the ability to think for yourself and then instead of developing that ability you just hop onto whatever group goes against what you grew up in.

It's not your group identity that gives you critical thinking skills, it's your ability to develop them yourself. Don't place your faith in a group - place it only in your own abilities."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffi2c9j,t1_ffi283h,1579963023.0,So your claim is there are actual militias roaming the God damned countryside like the powder gangers from fallout 3? I just highly doubt that.
insanepeoplefacebook,ffi25db,t1_ffgvwx4,1579962853.0,What would impeachment do friend? His term is up in a few months and impeachment doesn't stop him running for next term - where he would not be impeached.
insanepeoplefacebook,ffi2225,t1_ffgveqg,1579962771.0,"If you are blaming Trump for your alcoholism you might want to take a look in the mirror man. That's a serious problem that's only propagated by yourself. It's easy to start shifting the blame to other things/people because then you don't have to face the inner demon yourself.

If you need help or just want to talk feel free to pm me."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffi1tbg,t1_ffgqne7,1579962554.0,It's very possible that happens though right? Learn from the mistakes of your fathers or be doomed to repeat them.
insanepeoplefacebook,ffi14sq,t1_ffh4327,1579961926.0,Can you give a concrete example instead of some vague statement that I highly doubt is even true.
insanepeoplefacebook,ffi0y0f,t1_ffgor4e,1579961751.0,"He never willingly stepped up. Washington never wanted to be a general. He never wanted to be a leader post-war either. He just wanted to go back and farm his grain for his whiskey (he had tried tobacco at first but it wasn't profitable enough). But, he recognized that if he didn't fill the void, someone less level headed and more partisan would. So he took on the responsibility he knew he had to take on, not the one he wanted to take on."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffi0rv4,t3_etescl,1579961588.0,"LMAO. Yes, because dynasty politics is exactly what our founding fathers wanted. If this kind of shit actually exists in the wild I'm starting to understand why people generalize Trump supporters. How fucking pathetic."
Futurology,ffh0nwg,t1_ffh0kyq,1579919953.0,"So number 4 is even worse than I originally thought...

Who authored this article and book anyway?"
Futurology,ffh08lz,t3_eteahl,1579919632.0,"Wat now. This article is literal shit.

1) everyone needs to be on the same nav system. Okay genius mathematicians, please tell me how you are going to achieve this?

2) get rid of parking spots on narrow streets. Okay this idea isn't total horseshit, but it is going to cause a problem for parking in cities.

3) green lanes for electric cars. So now we are taking up an entire lane for what is not a relevant enough vehicle yet? Yes ... Limiting the number of lanes on a road will help traffic...

4) create a twin roadway. Lol wat. Of course if you double your infrastructure you can now accommodate double the people.

Whatever these mathematicians are getting paid, it's way too much."
MurderedByWords,ffdt3cm,t1_ffdn8ws,1579828240.0,Why get an animal if you cannot afford the financial burdens it brings?
MurderedByWords,ffdsuuh,t1_ffdisd3,1579828071.0,"It is. This is yet another liberal lie to push their agenda. If you work it, you get paid for it. Doesn't matter if you were ""supposed"" to take a break or not."
MurderedByWords,ffds4gn,t1_ffdmjai,1579827559.0,"But the fact of the matter is you are in a better position now. You worked your ass off, did the right things, and now you are where you deserve to be. System checks out to me."
MurderedByWords,ffdrdwp,t3_esy8ce,1579827066.0,Well I work 70-80 hours a week in my salary job. So let's double all those numbers. Why should a salaried employee who works 80 hours get punished because a minimum wage worker only wants to work 40?

MAGAs,ffcj9le,t1_ffcj3m8,1579800647.0,"I never even used a ""they""? Are you just firing a generic response back at me that some socialist overlord told you to use?

I already told you this is my experience on #Reddit. There I hope that is big enough for you to see past the ass cheeks on either side of your face."
