I wonder if those overly pessimistic timelines on some parts are leading to larger delays in the overall program. Theres been a lot of points where the team working on one part has said ""we could be done with this in a couple weeks, but the schedules for the other teams working on the parts it interfaces with say they won't be done for a few more months, so we're going to spend longer on it to develop process improvements for later flights/redirect our resources to other tasks"". Unnecessarily cuts into their official schedule margin, and it seems conceivable they could occasionally run into scenarios where none of the teams involved actually needs to wait anyway.

SpaceLaunchSystem,ffh730z,t1_ffh04cg,1579924944.0,"Realistically, if they go for 2 *landings* (so minimum of 3 or 4 SLS launches under this architecture) per year, its going to require massive design changes to accommodate that. SLSs flight rate has never been limited by money. The main schedule driver is RS-25 production. It looks unlikely they'd be able to scale production of those enough for even 2 a year for an expendable 4-engine configuration, and Aerojet themselves specifically said more money will not meaningfully address this problem. The second biggest schedule driver is outfitting of the engine section, which, due to its sheer complexity and size, again seems to have little potential for either faster production or practical paralleling

The interesting thing though is that the upgrades which would make this achievable at any price point (ie, engine section reusability plus BOLE) would very easily allow a *much* higher flightrate, at an even more italicized *much* lower price with little to no changes needed outside of that. 6-8 launches a year at sub-300 million a flight should be easily doable. It seems to me like this would probably be the ideal solution for everyone involved: NASA gets more launch capacity at a lower ongoing price, Boeing gets a massive contract to develop that reuse and then probably overall ongoing revenue stays about the same because if the higher flightrate, Boeing's SLS-dependent lunar architecture becomes a lot more feasible, Aerojet would still be developing RS-25E and delivering ~3-4 engines a year for the forseeable future which was their max capacity anyway, and SLS stays politically viable for a few more years instead of being cancelled outright and all of these entities getting nothing"

Politicians see a need to ""create jobs"", at a time when despite significant economic growth the need for employment is still rapidly dropping, so they basically just bribe companies. ""We need you to hire 200 people, in exchange we'll cut a few hundred million off your taxes/pay for that huge infrastructure project you need/change regulations to help you a bit"", and most of those jobs will have to be for something pointless because the company has no legitimate need for those employees. Government programs are even worse, since they don't need to even attempt efficiency and can blindly hire as many people as the politicians say they need, and it doesn't matter if they even produce some real good/service

End this practice and we could, practically overnight and with zero technological advancement needed, probably eliminate half the workforce, and put a big dent in the energy/resource consumption per useful product unit, and drastically reduce development time for new tech.

Which is effectively why startups are successful, they're able to do the same amount with far fewer employees and thus lower cost because they've not expanded beyond what is necessary (either due to bribes or managerial incompetence).

Lady, I'm a CS student, I don't give much of a crap about history or writing, I'm only here because I need to graduate. This was done in 3 days and, other than one minor deviation (an additional source beyond what was recommended) I did the bare minimum here.

technology,ffcyqx6,t1_ffctzoq,1579810035.0,"Thats pretty reasonable actually, if they'd be laying new fiber to do so. That shits expensive to bury, especially in rural areas (cost per mile is a few orders of magnitude higher in urban areas, but in rural areas the distances involved are so much higher and number of customers is so much lower that it works out even worse).

Not that it matters much anyway though, chances are ISPs would just pocket this money, do nothing, and then come back again in 5 years asking for another 50 billion to do the same upgrade. Like they have before.

This is basically why satellite internet is being pursued. The entire development and deployment cost of Starlink (which will provide gigabit internet at <30 ms latency to the entire planet) is roughly what it'd cost to set up fiber for 2-3 medium sized cities. Way cheaper to go to space and transmit wirelessly from there. Downside is it won't work well in urban areas because if physical limits in how many users can be served simultaneously per land area, but for rural areas it should be pretty awesome"

todayilearned,ffcuurg,t1_ffcoopw,1579807726.0,"No, communism doesn't have central planning. Thats kind of... the opposite of communism as a political structure. Transitioning societies usually did historically, but this was only necessary because none of the historical attempts at communism started in countries that had capitalism (despite capitalism being a prerequisite...), so they attempted to achieve the necessary technological level as quickly as possible through dictatorship, but that is no longer widely seen as a viable course of action (mainstream communist theory is now that capitalism's tendency towards technologies incompatible with its own existence, namely automation, will organically bring about communism)"

spacex,ffcpsma,t1_ffci2yi,1579804649.0,"The USAF was concerned about risk in it flying at all, which is kinda silly. As you say, even Starship with an expendable (or ""reusable, but pending certification"") upper stage should be marginally cheaper than Falcon Heavy for a bunch more capability. If you just consider that option, Starship is more mature than any of the other bids: Raptor has way more full-power test time than BE-4 and is already (while slow compared to what SpaceX anticipates needing) in what would be generally considered ""mass production"", they're building test article structures pretty quickly and will soon begin assembling the first flight vehicle, and they're the only ones with experience actually reusing a rocket.

Northrop's bid is the worst option on all fronts. Its the highest scheduke risk (Castor 300 and 1200 have never been test fired, the one Castor 600 tested had an ""anomaly"", GEM-63 has only fired once but not 63XL/XLT, and RL10C-5 has had only component test fires, and built by a company with no experience in liquid rocket design), highest flight risk (many stages with no redundancy possible), highest cost, lowest achievable flight rate, lowest performance, least evolvability"
