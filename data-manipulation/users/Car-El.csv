They're all geniuses who somehow managed to figure it out, meanwhile I'm a fucking idiot who can't even be content despite having all the attributes that you claim lead to happiness. Should I just pick up a heroin addiction and nod off until I OD?"
depression,ffdf1xb,t1_ffc1dan,1579819518.0,"What is the answer? Everyone always says suicide isn't it but they won't say what is, it's like some cruel game of 20 questions where you're supposed to just figure out the solution to life on your own. Suicide might not be the best answer but it's the only one I've found that makes any sense at all, so what am I supposed to do?"
unpopularopinion,ffddcj5,t1_ffdczif,1579818497.0,"I am an evil person and I know it, that's why I plan on killing myself as soon as possible so that I can no longer taint this world and all the precious resources that are being wasted on me can be put toward those who actually deserve them. It was a mistake that I was ever born in the first place and now I'm left with the responsibility of rectifying that mistake. Also for the record read the last sentence of my post, I know that what I see as the solution to the human condition is wrong and instead advise people to work on making the world a better place for future generations so that less people like me end up existing at all."

Of course there are worse people than me but I've already made all the positive impact I will have on the world and am now more of a hindrance to society than a help, I know my family appreciates me but everyone else is just a tiny bit worse off due to my existence and when you add it all up it would be a net benefit for me to no longer sap up resources that should be used on those less fortunate and more deserving."

unpopularopinion,ffbqwd2,t1_ffbplxi,1579779139.0,"I would support it if they allowed you to get on a registry that you have to wait for 5 years on before they allow you to die, I agree that there are a lot of people who would make a rash spur of the moment decision that doesn't make sense for them, but there are also a lot of other people who live in constant pain and have no hope of ever not wanting to die. Not to mention shitty people who just can't help but being bad despite putting in the effort to change themselves, the world would just be a lot better off without some people and if they willing to admit it I don't see why they should be forced to stay."

But thank you for reporting this I'm sure the mods removing a clearly unpopular opinion will result in the world being a much better place."
unpopularopinion,ffbqfi9,t1_ffbpkmw,1579778527.0,"So you would force them to live a life of pain on the off chance that something good might happen to them?

depression,ffbnw1z,t1_ffbmd9f,1579774841.0,The funny thing is when I inevitably kill myself I'm sure they'll make a big deal about it and act like they give a shit. I think I'm gonna make a list of people that I would like banned from my funeral and who I don't want to get any of my stuff so that they at least can't get any attention or satisfaction from my death.

depression,fevflht,t1_feveryq,1579396848.0,"They made me have Parkinsons like tremors though, but based on how I feel now that's better than the alternative. I'm hoping that I can find a new drug that helps me feel better without making me constantly shake my arms and legs but if I have to put up with that I guess I will. Also worth noting they didn't make me happy and if anything made my anxiety a lot worse, but at least I didn't feel as strong of an urge to kill myself all the time."
depression,fev6xlb,t3_eqnbva,1579393816.0,"I changed my meds recently and the new ones aren't working (I'm trying to get in contact with my Dr ASAP to fix this) so I'm back in full depression mode where I can barely get out of bed all day and while I'm hungry all day eating anything makes me want to throw up, I also tried to kill myself a few days ago. This is not a state I ever want to experience myself and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, anyone who thinks this is even remotely glamorous simply doesn't understand what it's like. Honestly I don't know how I went on for so many years like this, I feel absolutely awful and helpless, it's amazing that I managed to accomplish anything like this. Also no one mentions the embarrassment and shame, I can't open up to anyone about myself because I'm ashamed for feeling like this at all so I just lock myself in my room all day and do nothing at all, I can't even bring myself to watch TV or play a game."
AskReddit,fetp7kc,t1_fetmiih,1579377907.0,"Well I'm not donating it until I die, otherwise I could easily be put into debt in which I need charity and nothing has changed, for the time being I'd rather have financial security and there will always be people who need it so it doesn't really matter when it gets donated."

depression,feq035t,t3_eqcvcx,1579335383.0,"I hear you and I care. My friends also have basically abandoned me recently, I haven't seen them since Halloween (some even longer) despite them living and working a short walk away from my place. I also noticed that they never text me or ask me to hang out and every time I do to them they either don't respond, say they can't, or say they will and then cancel at the last second so I've stopped contacting them and I guess they haven't noticed. It really sucks being in this position and feeling so alone, I don't know what else to say since if I did I would be doing it myself, but I want you to know that you are heard and that some stranger on the internet hopes you feel better and succeed at everything you set out to do."
AskReddit,fepv6r7,t1_fephuxe,1579332462.0,"Thank you, I have been looking/applying for work but I'm stuck in that period of being a recent college graduate where I'm over qualified for any low level ""regular"" work so they don't want to hire me and all other ""entry level"" jobs require years of experience. Hopefully I'll get a job soon because I can't keep living like this doing absolutely nothing. Anyway thank you for responding, it makes me feel less alone knowing that someone even acknowledges my problems since so many think I love not having a job, but at least I'm lucky enough to have the financial freedom that I can afford it."
AskReddit,feoramj,t1_fen2dq4,1579304379.0,"Right now I'm currently in the position you want. I feel horrible for not having a job and living off the money my grandparents left me. I tried to kill myself two days ago, one of many reasons being that I feel like if I weren't living off this money it could be put toward improving people's lives who actually deserve it. If I could I would die right now and give it all to you, I hate the man I've become. I don't mean to imply that more money wouldn't make your life infinitely better, but just know that it isn't a guaranteed path to happiness."
confession,femclad,t3_epwx5a,1579248679.0,"Not sure why everyone here is telling you to stay in your current relationship, if you're not into your current girlfriend you should be honest and break up with her, even if you don't get this girl you have a crush on. IMO it's much worse to lead someone on who you aren't really into than to leave them when you no longer have the feelings you once did for them."
TrueAskReddit,fej8gda,t3_ena1md,1579161393.0,"I recommend backing up your saves to a memory card and keeping that if you do decide to get rid of it. It will take up very little room and it may mean a lot to you later in life if you decide to get back into gaming or have a kid you want to introduce to it. I've lost a lot of saves and memory cards over the years but I treasure the ones I still have, so much time and emotion went into those games I would hate to lose my record of that.

That being said you can get a lot more money selling it on eBay rather than to a local shop, local shops usually will only give you ~1/3-1/2 of what it's worth to make a profit, by selling it yourself you can make all of that profit and give the person you're selling it to a better deal than the store would."

God if I could go back in time I would tell myself from a few months ago to just do it then, if I did it now though I'd probably be doing the world a favor anyway, even if I'm not thought of very highly."

selfharm,fdex158,t3_ekyv44,1578348388.0,"Honestly I kind of side with her, I started cutting around then and I'm pretty sure if I hadn't been exposed to the idea of cutting myself I wouldn't have come up with it on my own. On the other hand I still used to hit myself all the time so cutting became more of an alternative outlet rather than a completely new one, but I'd much rather I had just continued bruising myself rather than being left with permanent scars. I think 12-14 is right in that sweet spot where you should avoid exposing kids to dangerous ideas because they're way more likely to try it out themselves at that age, I think it's healthy when it comes to stealing a few beers or smoking pot with their friends, but cutting is not something that a kid should be exposed to at that age."
selfharm,f9rncpy,t3_e6m006,1575578686.0,"I would bring it up to your doctors but this doesn't really sound like self harm (in my non-professional opinion), if you're seeking relief from itching and scratch yourself a little too deep in the process that's an accident and not really the same as intentionally inflicting cuts and pain on yourself on purpose. Honestly this sounds more like either a skin condition or a mental disorder that causes you to be very itchy, but unless you start out with the plan of causing yourself pain/harm (rather than relief from the itchiness), it's not self harm."
