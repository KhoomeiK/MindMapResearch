If I use a USB-A to USB-C adapter and plug it into a USB-C port on my PC, assuming the connection works without issue, will enough power gets passed along to my Quest to prevent the battery from slowly draining?"

OculusQuest,ff9vy8m,t1_ff9cr82,1579722692.0,I've heard almost only good things and recommendations for their 3 meter cable. Hopefully the same praise will be deserved with this cable assuming it has the same build and quality as the 3 meter cable.

OculusQuest,ff71bx9,t3_erype5,1579639158.0,"If you're noticing that the blurry spots are on the sides or near the corners of your eyes, that's actually normal. The Quest uses a process called (fixed) foveated rendering, which lowers the resolution/rendering detail on the outside parts of whatever you're currently looking at. This saves resources and lets the Quest render the image in the center of your view, what you'd most likely be focusing the most on, in higher quality or at least able to maintain frame rates."

theydidthemath,fek2xe1,t1_fejceg7,1579191478.0,"Wow that's absolutely incredible that you were able to do the math on that. I can hardly believe it even though you clearly laid out your logic and calculations. Bravo, well done.

I did notice that you misplaced a comma at the end, when multiplying 258,333,333.33 hours by U.S. minimum wage, and that the amount is actually ~$1,872,916,666.67. $1.87 billion! And that's only assuming the average failure rate of 0.5, plus the assumption that there hasn't been any growth in USB devices manufactured per year globally, which I believe it's fair to say that it's definitely within the realm of possibility for that number to be even higher. Absolutely insane."
