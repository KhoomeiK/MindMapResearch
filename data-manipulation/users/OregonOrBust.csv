Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ffc7uuu,t1_ffc7n44,1579793548.0,True but what else can you do?  Data is king and we want to understand the reality of things as best we can.
Cooking,ffc7isc,t1_ffapdhj,1579793332.0,For me it's Dawn dish soap.  Can't find a better soap imo.
science,ffc5qne,t1_ffaprk5,1579792159.0,Just watched it last night.  What's really exciting is the possibility of that universal flu vaccine.  I will poop my pants if that ever happens.  Had the flu twice and it's just awful.  Last time I think I aged about 5 years.
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ffc57mv,t1_ffc40b8,1579791805.0,"It's absolutely related but you're not really getting it so I'll try to answer you anyway.  I don't have any data on the specific topic but I am familiar with another.  In the case of sexual assault we have data from people who many many years later report that they never reported incidents during the times they were happening.  So from that data we can say x number of people so not report being sexually assaulted.  That's just one example you can imagine others like neighbors reporting domestic abuse but the victims not self reporting, convictions based on medical attention betting sought by victims who didn't report, etc etc.."

CampingandHiking,fdjors2,t3_elml9s,1578481286.0,"Mid 90s my buddy and I are hiking Mt. Timpanogos from Aspen Grove.  Never having been there we, for some reason (probably because there were no cars at the trailhead), we thought we were alone up there.  We're going to get up to the little lake at base of a glacier that evening, get a few hours if sleep, and then get up to the summit for sunrise (highly recommended).  We kind of crest what is the end of the really steep stuff and it gotten very dark.  We both had these little mag-lights with dieing batteries.  Figure the odds they literally both date into dim nearly useless lights at the same time.  So we're hiking along following the trail by two little 6 inch golden glowing spots on the ground and we can't see anything else at all.  We had been quiet for ways and I stop, turn around toward my friend, and wait a good 5 minutes for him in the silence if the dark night.   When he catches up I say ""I wonder when we'll get to that lake and how the hell we'll see it"".  And I shit you not about 2 feet from my head and at the same height I hear a very deep voice say ""You're standing right next to it"" and then nothing else.  We said thanks to the voice in the darkness and moved on just little further before camping.   It may not seem that creepy but it was too us.  This guy had to be standing right next to me in a pretty open area right off the trail silently for some time before speaking up.  Still I'm grateful for his helpful info."

Veterans,fddm80z,t1_fddf3zx,1578317522.0,I'm in a bunch of FB groups that help people and it's fairly regular in them.  It has definitely increased in the last year or so.  I don't know how they have time for that with the backlog they have but they do.

Veterans,fddbiee,t3_ekfgo2,1578304114.0,Did you try writing your Nexus letter for them and asking them to sign it if they agree with it?  I'm not at my PC right now but I used a form letter that asks the doctors to write a nexus letter for me.

Meditate every chance you get and learn that you don't have to let those thoughts carry you away or suck you in.  If you can do just that through a daily meditation practice you will find a lot more peace in life.  Don't be fooled though, this is no easy task.  Sitting with our thoughts and learning to come back to the breath is hard but you can do it.  What else do you have going on?  Go for it."

You need a current diagnosis, an in-service accident or medical records, AND the Nexus letter to connect the two.  Go to the doctor that has been seeing him about the wrist and ask them to write you a Nexus letter. do some research on the web and find out all the things that a Nexus letter needs.
