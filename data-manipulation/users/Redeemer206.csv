I wouldn't blame the Golden Generation or Gen X for those problems. The Golden Generation were strong proponents for American-made products and products that you'd only have to buy once in a lifetime that could be easily repaired, and they believed in a strong economy and moral values.

Gen X are largely victims of all the crap the baby boomers did to undo all the progress of the previous generation. Gen X was destined to be reactionary to the baby boomer generation. So a lot may have been misguided, but they're at least open to positive change, and a few have become based Republicans since.

All the problems lie at the foot of the baby boomer generation. They're the ones who tanked the economy via mass consumerist ideas, and began the age of hedonism with the hippie movements and rampant drug use. They took everything their parents gave them and completely used it up or ran it into the ground. It's also the generation that started the uptick in domestic abuse, of kids as well as spouses, so the uptick on dysfunctional houses and single-parent households started with them. The Baby Boomer generation is quite possibly the worst generation in especially American history because they began the path towards consumerism and convenience at the cost of American jobs and American way of life."

Agreed. And collecting things isn't inherently wrong. Even collecting funkos isn't inherently wrong. They're a cheap way for people to buy collectibles (instead of 100-200 dollar figurines) and as long as you don't have too many, it's frankly a harmless way to show your love for an entertainment franchise.

Consoomer status is always when it's taken to the extreme, as in being obsessed with the franchise/Fandom that you collect every single merchandise piece"
