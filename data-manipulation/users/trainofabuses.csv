StupidFood,fef66q4,t1_fef3b08,1579049123.0,"Notice that I never said that we shouldn’t teach the prestige dialect, I absolutely think we should, because it is useful, for work and places where it is expected, not because it is “proper”. I think pidgins and creoles and nonstandard dialects are really cool from a linguistic standpoint and it’s fascinating to study them because they give a lot of insight into how language evolves and how our brains work. They’re not ugly, they are natural and interesting. It’s not some version of the noble savage trope, I’m not putting them on a pedestal, just saying they are equally expressive to prestige english and have their own contexts. You’re putting an awful lot of words in my mouth. You can teach prestige dialects without denigrating non-prestige dialects, which is what I believe should be done. There’s a lot more context and nuance to it than “these people talk wrong”"

StupidFood,fed9vy5,t1_fecu4fd,1579005085.0,"I’m pretty sure I’m not going to change your mind, but african american vernacular english is a dialect of english, just as expressive as prestige dialects of english, and is not inherently “bad” or “improper” and is not idiot pidgin slang. Language evolves. People have been decrying the “decay” of language forever and they have all been wrong. It’s good to learn prestige dialects because it helps one succeed, but the fact that it is necessary is more indicative of systemic racism than there being one god-given, absolutely correct perfect version of the queen’s english. In short this is bad linguistics and a really bad take on language and society, but you’re just going to say i’m a shithead so whatever."

wholesomememes,fc8g3pg,t1_fc8d525,1577534145.0,"but my question is how you evaluate the usefulness of the model. like, what advantages do you get from one or the other in terms of actual understanding, and if it doesn’t actually denote anything significant then who cares?

maybe we are saying the same thing. bickering over whether it’s a continent or not is useless unless “continent” has a specific and useful meaning in some context, but i feel like it’s nebulous and general enough to be somewhat of unhelpful and insignificant classification. kinda like people arguing over Pluto being a planet except australia is a big ass landmass and obv significant whereas there are objects larger than pluto in the area. idk i just don’t get the point."
wholesomememes,fc8bu49,t1_fc8321x,1577531393.0,what does it mean to be a continent? is it a meaningful scientific classification or just some constructed category with little relevance except in arguing about labels? what does not classifying australia as a continent get you in terms of understanding? honestly asking
