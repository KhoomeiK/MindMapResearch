Mike has a ton of creativity and he was about to lose his biggest canvas. Trey was in “I give up” mode and Fish and Page, well they aren’t really song writers, just performers imo. Mike had the most to lose."

education,ff41ocy,t3_erfbqf,1579553607.0,"Personally I think there is WAY TOO MUCH education research. Most of the things that college professors need to publish are garbage and don’t ever make it to the classroom. And the good research that is out there is mostly ignored. I don’t love Hattie and Visible Learning, but how much of that is actually implemented by principals?"

phish,fen5x9c,t1_felf9rj,1579277684.0,I was just feeling lucky to have been been able to that back in the day. Just finished high school and then started college. I remember a group of us on dorm phones calling Ticketmaster for 10/31. We scored tix and packed about 10 people in a panel van from Indiana to Atlanta.

The Mike story was funny though.  He was just sitting outside at this fountain and nobody was even near him.  I sat down next to him and started chatting.  He said he had bough some vintage photography gear at some shop in the mall.

Many years later I ran into him again and had him take my picture, but that's a whole nother story"

Economics,fe3tg0s,t1_fe3jewv,1578852684.0, Because there will always be people at the bottom and they will be a huge drag on the economy through crime and healthcare etc. it would be cheaper in the long run to help these people. Why does prison cost more than community college? You’re putting your morals ahead of the economy.
