Idk, I just want to be 'good' y'know? I guess it's my anxiety. I'll just focus more on what I'm doing, thanks though!

PS: Yeah my bad, I meant 2 for DPS since 1 means you HAVE aggro = Tank."

Can make a character I genuinely like playing as, enjoy the aesthetics of.

Some of the female idle poses are just.. a lot nicer imo than the male counter parts.

I've just got Kale and Caulifla from the story event, I'm trying to unlock their 4 paths in the potential system but I can't use their SR dupes.
Do I need to level up the SR dupes and awaken them first?
Meaning I need to farm 4 more SRs, awaken them, then farm 4 more sets of 5 medals each before I can use them to unlock the 4 potential paths?

I don't fancy doing that to find out it's not the case, is all. xD"
DBZDokkanBattle,fdapybw,t1_fdaffka,1578248855.0,"
Rightyo that's all I wanted to hear! I'll start getting to work on those units, I never knew that either about the rotation/attack slots, I always assumed it was 'random' which way they appeared in battle, so there is that. You've definitely given me a lot to think about, I'll throw a saiyan team together based on your recommendation and see what we can achieve, I've been borrowing peoples LR Kale/Caulifla and I can't WAIT to get mine up to LR now because they're an absolute monster. You also cleared up another question I forgot to mention, Crit/AA are priority for the potential system so that's perfect, my Gohan and Vegeta/Trunks are rainbowed to Crit then AA.

But again seriously, thanks a bunch! I hope you have a new year just as epic as you. :D"
