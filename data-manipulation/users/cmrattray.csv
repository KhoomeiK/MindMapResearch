Sounds like you married young? The only way to reduce this risk is to marry and have children later. Guys should really wait until they are closer to 30 and women should wait until they are at least 25. Everyone changes over the course of their lifetime, but the risk of big change after these dates is much lower.

Divorce your wife, get shared custody. The financial and emotional pain will only get worse the longer you wait."

Fire is the natural way of clearing out debris...we spent a century putting out every fire before it had a chance to burn, so now we have a terrifying amount of fuel laying about the state.

I moved to PA, where the forests are cleared of deadwood, which people burn to heat their homes in the winter, and underbrush is cleared with brush hogs and controlled burns."

I’m not disagreeing with your technical definition (I even combined the two into their traditional name of natural philosophy).. But technically, virtually every non-engineering undergraduate degree offered by a university is a liberal arts degree. Universities are broken down into different colleges, and it is going to be a very rare occurrence for physics and math to be located in the liberal arts college (which may be named humanities for social science, history, language and political science. There will also be colleges for natural science, biological science, and engineering. 

Most importantly, you know what is meant when people talk about liberal arts vs the sciences. They aren’t suggesting that vocational school is the alternative."

California,ff5r87c,t1_ff5ggk0,1579607073.0,"Most CEOs also have MBAs.

There is nothing wrong with a liberal arts degree, but they are generally not the route to a high paying job, which is the real issue if you are justifying borrowing money to attend school. The return on the investment isn’t there. And the taxpayers shouldn’t be on the hook for paying for people to pursue their dreams with little hope of seeing a return when the student joins the workforce (or has kids after a couple years...)

If there were tons of excess revenue, my feelings would be totally different, but we can’t afford the basics for society right now, let alone luxuries."
California,ff5qva3,t1_ff5edqn,1579606614.0,"I’m all for free college if they restrict supply, meaning the tax payers will get max value out of their investment. The people crying for free college are the ones who would never succeed under the old system of actually need more than a loan guarantee to qualify.

And any free college system should still have a paid route.

I think the easiest way to fix the whole university price inflation is tying academic performance to loan qualifications. Make people maintain a B average to keep their loans."
