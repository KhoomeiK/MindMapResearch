bestoflegaladvice,ffnhszj,t1_ffn2lry,1580066155.0,"You are correct. Nuclear and radiological are *very* different. A proper nuclear weapon's destructive mechanism is the same as any explosive, just amplified (they are relatively ""clean"", despite what Fallout depicts - consider that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not only inhabited, but are fairly large cities all things considered). A radiological weapon is meant to contaminate an area and sicken those within it (which makes them quite possibly a larger pain in the ass - kinda like the theory of wounding a soldier making his side devote resources to caring for him while killing him does not).

(Of course, you can have a weapon that is *both* nuclear and radiological - so-called ""salted bombs"" contained material (such as cobalt) that would be activated in the initial nuclear reaction, and then spread far and wide as radiological material.)"

Toxoplasmosis infection ***has no significant statistical correlation with cat ownership***.

>[Risk factors most strongly predictive of acute infection in pregnant women were eating undercooked lamb, beef, or game, contact with soil, and travel outside Europe and the United States and Canada. **Contact with cats was not a risk factor.** Between 30% and 63% of infections in different centres were attributed to consumption of undercooked or cured meat products and 6% to 17% to soil contact.](https://www.bmj.com/content/321/7254/142)

>[Since cats are the single source of toxoplasma oocysts, the above finding indicates that cats are an epidemiologically significant source of environmental contamination in Belgrade. **However, cat ownership itself as a criterion of contact with cats was not associated with infection \(p = 0.326\).**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1007461225944)

Oh, and let's not forget that the only infection route (excluding transplants) is *oral*, *T.Gondii* oocysts are shed in *fecal matter* from an infected cat, and aren't even immediately infectious - they require at least a day to sporulate. You would literally have to eat *old cat shit*.

Oh, and only people with weakened immune systems (such as from HIV/AIDS) are particularly vulnerable to infection. (Pregnant women are considered a risk because of the possibility of transmission to the fetus, but are unlikely to contract an ongoing infection.)

>Attendance and Withdrawal

>Class Attendance.  
A student is expected to attend each meeting of every class for which he/she is registered. Each instructor is responsible for explaining, in writing, the practice in the treatment of absences at the beginning of each course. Regular class attendance is a definite part of the total performance required for the satisfactory completion of any course, and an unsatisfactory attendance record may adversely affect the final grade recorded for the course. If the attendance record of a student becomes unsatisfactory, the instructor can record a last of date of attendance that can adversely affect Financial Aid, Scholarships, Veteran's Benefits and other types of assistance. Unsatisfactory class attendance may result in the student receiving a grade of ""F."" A student who is unable to return to classes due to an emergency or serious accident should notify the Office of Student Affairs. A student who cannot avoid an absence from a class for any other reason is expected to assume the responsibility of explaining his absence to the instructor and for making arrangements to complete the work missed. Tardiness is recorded as an absence. ***Students may consider a class dismissed and leave the room without penalty if the instructor fails to appear within fifteen minutes.*** At the end of each period, a ten-minute interval is allowed for changing classes."
