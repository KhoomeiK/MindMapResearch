AskReddit,fevmcmm,t3_eqies2,1579399059.0,"My Dad and I went out for some milk and other essential items. As we returned to our subdivision, we passed a kid who looked to be about my age with a similar build and a seemingly identical jacket (I didn’t see his face) walking a dog that looked oddly similar to mine. I didn’t think much of it at the time. About an hour later, I decided to take the dog for a walk. As we approached the street corner from earlier, a truck that looked just like my Dad’s drove by, driven by my Dad with someone in the passenger seat (Again, I didn’t get a good look at the kid’s face). I then noticed that the license plate was identical. When I got home, the truck was in the exact same spot as when I left (I know because it started raining just after I left, and it was completely dry under the truck. I had an umbrella). Dad also confirmed that he hadn’t gone anywhere, and so did my Step-Mom."
