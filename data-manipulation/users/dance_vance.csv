After weeks of wavering between having a kid or not we decided to terminate,  but once they did the ultrasound at planned parenthood we discovered we were 3 months in. No symptoms besides constipation and “bloating”. So we decided to have a baby instead. Just got my hormonal IUD after kid 2 because they boast about the success rate but I’ve had multiple people tell me they ended up pregnant on it! So hubby is getting a snip because knowing my luck this will fail me too. Cannot imagine having it fail AND the procedure fail. Friggin A!"

The end. 

Boyfriend sounds extremely insecure. I’m curious, if roles were reversed and he had to make that call with a girl, would he kick her out into the snow storm? 

Call his bluff. If he feels that’s strongly and wants to break up over this, good riddance. You don’t need to start developing anxiety every time you hang out with guys whether it’ll upset him for some reason or another."

relationship_advice,fepk7nm,t3_eqbfr7,1579322645.0,"I read your post before you deleted it and wanted to weigh in, if you’re still interested? 

Relationships are a lot of hard work. Nobody ever warns you about that. Even the easy ones need maintaining. It’s normal to get into patterns around certain things and it seems these common arguments (same topic?) are your relationships bad pattern. Not resolving them isn’t conducive to a healthy relationship and quite frankly does lead to the “why bother trying” mentality your BF is taking. You need to find your trigger and approach it differently. There’s a step by step conversation pattern that our counselor gave us for this exact reason. Basically you’re stating what you want (change etc), how it’ll look like and how it’ll NOT look like, how it’s benefit them, ask what they need/want in order to work with you (not sexual/direct bargaining) and don’t argue with their idea, thank them for listening. 

Here’s an example: I want cuddles without sex.

Babes, I would love for us to be able to cuddle without you trying to take it further. I’m thinking like laying in each other’s arms while watching a movie and not just before bed, (he came back with my being in undies as his want in order to meet my need.  We agreed and at-da! Innocent cuddles. 

It’s not easy but it’s doable."

relationship_advice,fepeg5c,t3_eqae2e,1579318474.0,"Whenever I watch my 600lb life, the person that is overweight is such a brat. They lash out, complain about everything that is being done for them (including being cleaned after shitting etc) and ALL their families enable it one way or another. You’re in the right with Tatty being enabled and Tatty knows he’s got the family on his side, hence the literal crap fest. You can choose your level of involvement in their relationships. Quite frankly it sounds like you need to. Tell them you would love to spend time with the family but Tatty’s behavior and lifestyle choices are intolerable to you so you will be stepping back from taking care of him, running apology errands and cleaning up behind him. You are available to help any other member of the family, you’ll be happy to see them at family dinners etc but unless he honors the boundaries you need to make your interactions pleasant, you’re out. Sorry you’re experiencing this. Family dynamics are really difficult but throw in parents that are overbearing and blind to their kids fault and it takes it to a whole different level.

relationship_advice,feiuvas,t3_epbkpf,1579147842.0,"This sounds like the beginning of the show My 600lb life. I’m no expert but I will say that my takeaway from that show is that the overweight person is often manipulative and the partner always ends up staying and basically enabling that lifestyle choice from guilt.  I can fully understand your frustration because that’s not what you married but unless you draw a hard line in the sand (set budget, therapy, dr app or you’re leaving) nothing will change besides her gaining weight and becoming immobile and more dependent on you. I’m sincerely sorry you’re experiencing this. At the end of the day your happiness is not something that should be removed from the negotiation table because she’s crying abuse. You’re your own advocate."

I would honestly just invite her over for a cup of coffee and lead with: “I’ve got property cameras and I’ve caught some inappropriate behavior between those two, I don’t feel comfortable seeing what’s happening and not letting you know but I’ll also understand if you want to tell me to mind my own business. Just thought if roles were reversed, I would appreciate a heads up.” 

Let her chose to see the footage and/ or hear more from you. Don’t be hurt if she becomes offended. We often get defensive when embarrassed and  some people lash out."

Second, your friends advice would just be giving her friends justification to step up theirs harassment. Hate to say it because it’s really a non action but you need to just rise above it. Block people on Facebook as much as possible. I get the dilemma of not being able to disconnect because of family but just keep blocking away. As for the workplace harassment, what are your states laws for recording without permission? You can make a point of turning on your phone to record all interactions with the people who have a history of misbehaving and either threaten them with HR action or just go straight to HR with the evidence. Either way you should have a heart to heart with HR and let them know what’s happening so if something blows up they do have an idea why it’s come to a head and will be more likely to back you up.  Deep breathes. Hope fully if you keep remaining “inmune” to their actions they may become bored and stop."
