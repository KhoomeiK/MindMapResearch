Also im confident the difference in punches between male featherweights and male heavyweights is much smaller than the difference between male heavyweights and female heavyweights.

G43 is for panzerfussiliers and makes them good at close to medium without sacrificing long range damage. It makes them incredibly potent on the move.

Volks stg44 makes the volks better at all ranges except their furthest, and kicks ass as an upgrade.

Obers Mg34 does more damage the further away you are and should be used stationary at max range where the obers are safe.

Obers stg44 makes the obers do shitloads of damage at medium and closer ranges and ignores most of the bonus that cover gives. Meaning your obers now obliterate people inside or outside cover at all ranges. This upgrade is amazing and if you have access to it you should always have atleast 1 ober squad with this upgrade."

CompanyOfHeroes,fgol066,t3_ezodgu,1580974087.0,"No, it's not ok, but id rather you leave instead of screaming at them.

But rather think about the whole situation and ask yourself why you feel they *must* listen to you and do as you order.

Maybe the teammate isnt good, does that even matter? Maybe its some dude who just worked back to back shifts and just wants to come home, smoke a bong and sneak in a quick game or two with his friend and the two of them are chatting on mic and playing together. Maybe after a long day of being told what to do and how to do it by his boss/teacher/wife/etc he just wants to sit down and enjoy himself playing a not serious wwii game where he gets to be the general of his own army.

Is it *really* right to punish him and ruin the game because he wont listen to your orders or he doesnt have the micro, map presence and experience to keep up with you?

Its one thing to leave a game because your teammates are trolling or berating you. It's another thing entirely to leave just because they dont want to have fun the way you want them to have fun."

CompanyOfHeroes,fg2pl81,t1_fg0a0z3,1580450980.0,"Yes definitely keep them behind your other soldiers to fight from long range and be safe. It is an ober squad. The officer himself does good damage with the pistol up close but its not worth closing the gap. At vet 5 with the stg, extra ober etc the squad is amazing at long to mid range.

I always give my fusiliers their g43s and my volks their mp44s before i start using officer abilities. Just vet the officer first.

Officer abilities are slightly cheaper after vet 1 i believe."

CompanyOfHeroes,fg01jwf,t3_ew6bju,1580398158.0,"They are godly amazing.

Firstly the squad itself kicks ass and vets up easily. At vet 5 it feels amazing.

Secondly, mark target and then focus fire everyone on the same squad. This melts the squad and essentially forces retreat or wipe, which in turn means more xp for your men. 

The force retreat ability should be used sparingly since it costs so much but lets say 2 enemy shocks have flanked your men and are threatening to wipe your squads on retreat. 2 shocks are hard as hell to deal with but if you retreat one, the other is now all alone, and wont be able to fight your army, so now he might aswell retreat too."
