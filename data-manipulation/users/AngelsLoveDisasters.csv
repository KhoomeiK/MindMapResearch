My issue with Beck is that in her POV, Joe is a guy that always helped her, gave her good advice, and supported her passion, all the while she allowed Peach to openly mock and disrespect him - even when he was nothing but polite to her. Yes, he’s the villain. But imagine if he was just a normal guy. That is how Beck would treat an average person who ISN’T a complete piece of trash to her. Also, she kept telling him how much she liked him, but still would sleep around with other guys to “find herself”. I get freedom of sexuality, but at least be honest to people. 

TLDL: Candace is a good character even though she made a huge mistake. Beck treats kinder people like trash and pulls her abusers closer."
