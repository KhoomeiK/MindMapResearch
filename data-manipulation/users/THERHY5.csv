britishproblems,feyd56o,t3_eqtj5z,1579443995.0,"My parents were the kind who didn't let us near tech until we were much older due to the fact they didn't understand it or how it worked n therefore it was considered evil, they were extreme, equally people who just let their kids do what ever are equally extreme, it's about having a balance n you seem to have found that balance so i don't get how any of what you said could be considered draconian. People are just too lazy to keep an eye on what their kids are doing i guess."

exmuslim,feuc868,t3_eqh4sx,1579385203.0,"I get this, in my house I'm not allowed to even dress in anything less than uber feminine and short hair is absolutely not allowed so there was no outlet. My own tastes switch from being super feminine to pretty tomboyish i love both just depends on my mood but it got so bad i feel disgusted that i like feminine things, i'd try to flatten my boobs as much as i could (it is an exercise in futility which resulted in more self hate), tried to get my voice to deepen(resorted to trying to get sore throats repeatedly because i hated the sound of my own voice so bad). I still deal with this as I'm still stuck living with my parents but I've been trying my best to be just a little less disgusted by my existence and have been succeeding to an extent but sometimes i just can't stop my mind from fighting against any rational thought on the matter."
