hoarding,ffqhsfc,t1_ffq30jk,1580134971.0,"I got an agreement from my husband that I could purge the house to my level of comfort. Once it was 50 % done, he decided it was much better.  He is more clutter blind  / dirt tolerant than i am, since he grew up in a hoarder house.  I am one generation removed.  My parents are really bad at organization, but keep the house clean.  Opening a kitchen cupboard  may result in an avalanche of pans.

 Our coping methods:  We have designated spots for stuff, lables where needed because it helps  keep things organized.  It is always a work in progress.  We are moving closer to minimalism for a lot of categorizes .  New Books and other media is all electronic. 

Most important: We agreed beforehand what was junk.and i reiteate that to him before I sort each category. I have a garage storage space cleared out for everything that didn't belong in the house.   I keep purging  that space then moving on to the next problem area in the house.
I just got started.  The biggest barrier for my husband throwing stuff away is sorting.  He hates it. I stick to our this is junk agreement. He  only sorts the  stuff i set aside as ' probably not  junk'.  He discards maybe 60 % depending on what it is.  I challenge him a lot during this.  Like, we bought this to do x, never used it, never did x, why keep it? Or we have 20 of these widgets, at most we need 2, pick the one you use the most, then the next  one.
Basics
My stuff I purge no questions asked.  2. house stuff I can purge with minimal questions.  
3 food nothing expired
Other stuff, sort then purge, organize and move to designated spot.

 I did garbage and papers first. Them he sorted the remaining pile i gave him.   Books and gaming stuff. I moved and organized it, very little purging except for the water damaged in storage  stuff.
 He does have 3 large bookshelves shelves in his office for all this as designated space. 

 Computer stuff, still a wip. We have 9 boxes of peripheral  cables,  7 towers, 6 broken monitors, 3 Rubbermaid totes of boards, hard drives and other parts:, and a printer that hasn't worked in 3 years.   Slowly breaking those down but everything is being  sorted and then  stored together in the garage.  I got him to agree that I can break down the  towers,  sort, donate most of it to a refurbishing place. 

Clothes: got rid of everything too worn to wear or that didn't fit. 

We set financial goals: savings for an extended  trip to Europe  together means we limit our other spending.

Active hobbies: only buy one thing,  finish it then move to the next project.  I struggle with this one.
Space constraints: nothing can go past it's designated space without being purged.  I have a garden stuff tote, if i want to add new, I have to get rid of something. 
One in, one out. 
Maintence is ongoing, but we got other hobbies that don't require new stuff. Joined a gym, go hiking and camping, garden, fix up our older house."

When my MIL had to move in with us, we let her bring 2 suitcases, clothes only,  and were absolutely strict on not letting her not aquire a hoard.  It sometimes got pretty ugly, but she was living in our house, our rules. Harsh or not, you need to keep boundaries. I think, hoarders, have difficulty with decisions. Having someone else say no, is helpful. 

 It took a year to get my MIL  into subsidized housing, in part because she initally refused the first 3 places. We told her she had to take one or move out.  
There was nothing wrong with any of the three, clean, safe and in good locations for access to the city and stuff she wanted  to do.  She did finally choose one, she  lived there 2 years then found  a place she liked better.  She's been there 5 years.

 3. Window cleaner works great on wood floors and as an all purpose cleaner ( ammonia, detergent, alcohol, water)   i buy this because I am too lazy to work out the right ratios, too much ammonia leaves a haze on my floors and waxed woodwork)
4  mineral oil ( baby oil) ( glass shower doors,  bathroom mirror, lemon oil can be used here too. After cleaning to keep it cleane. Never on the tub or floor, too slippery!!!

I wear gloves, a long sleeve shirt, hat,  tuck long pants into socks, a sturdy pair of shoes and most important a n95 facemask. If it is a sloppy mess ( refrigerator, moldy items like food or wet clothing) I wear a disposable painters suit over a pair of shorts and a T shirt. Once the area is cleared, you  need to stuff any exterior entry points with steel wool and expanding foam.  If it's the floor that has holes or walls,  see if you can cover them with 3/4 inch thick plywood.  Please talk to a profesional about the hoarding.  It is a symptom of  a disorder like anxiety that can improve with help and self care."

Put down a towel to lay on.  I sweated like crazy when I had the flu. I would wake up, toss the wet towel in the laundry basket and grab a new one to lay on.  It kept the sheets and mattress from getting wet and thar clammy gross feeling.  If you have multiple sets of sheets, get someone to help you change them. Ask them to wash and dry them for you.
 ready to eat foods like broth,  soup that you can microwave  or just mix with hot water and eat.  Weird but helped me feel better:  mixing a packet of flavored jello with 2x the amount of boiling water  and drinking like tea  helped a lot.

When times up,  firmly blot with a clean towel. Stepping on it works well. Repeat. Finish with water to rinse and dry well by stepping on the towel.  What you don't want to do is spread the stain to a larger area. Or scrub the carpet to the point you  mat the fibers.

I daily clean, and deep clean the kitchen and bathroom  2  or 3 x a year. Cover the tops of cabinets and the fridge  in newspaper, peel and stick shelf paper or aluminum foil.

Some of it is sentimental stuff,  some of it is hobbies  and things that we have outgrown our interest in.  The memories will still be there, good and bad. First get rid of the stuff that causes bad memories. The good memories:  especially childhood things, are they yours or your parents memory?  If they are yours, would a picture suffice for the person who wants  to keep the item? If they are your parents memories  of you as a child, take a picture of you with the item for them, then state that you want to pass the item on.  Some of the pictures will be hilarious, hey look me and a shirt i wore when i was 3 weeks old.  My mom had a bunch of sentimental stuff that she didn't want but triggered a good  memory when she found it again so she was struggling to get rid of it. Felt guilty that she didn't want it. For her,  we took pictures, unearthed family photos,  then grouped the pictures with the picture of the person associated with the item.  All photos are now electronic so she can flip through the images when she wants.   After a while, the box of items, stored in the garage, could go.  This has not been as successful for my fil or sil, they need the tactile experience for the memory.  For them, right now we are sorting, encouraging them to keep the "" best"" things and let the rest go.  I think kon mari books handle sentimental items really well."
