TheBrewery,fekblnp,t3_epkdod,1579196641.0,"This is why craft beer is getting saturated with crappy beer and off flavors.  I read an article about a brewery opening in Denver (where I live) and the head brewer had brewed couple of batches of homebrew in college so that was his qualifications to be the head brewer. Brewing good beer is hard, and almost no one makes 6 figures doing  it. Let's encourage brewers who have an actual interest in the history, art and science of beer. Not someone who thinks it will make them a rock star. It won't especially if your beer sucks."
