AskReddit,ffhgdf9,t1_ffhfomd,1579934082.0,"Imagine telling the person who wants people to adhere to safe and proper road etiquette that they shouldn’t be driving.  The irony. Look, I’m sorry about your trauma, but you choosing not to use your blinker shouldn’t be the standard. I’m certain the other 50% of people on the road who don’t signal are not experiencing trauma and are indeed just being lazy.. This isn’t an issue where I’m from. It’s only when I moved to my current city that I saw how many people treat the turn handle as if it’s a useless piece of decoration. The rules are there for a reason, and it really doesn’t require that much effort. If it bothers you that deeply, fine. Special case. But I’m not letting everyone else off the hook."

INEEEEDIT,ff9m1w7,t1_ff9dn1c,1579715835.0,"I don’t get what point you’re trying to make about hating society. Ok, society is responsible for much of the perceptions we have about each other, that much is obvious. How does acknowledging that change anything? And I don’t care about being quirky, my point is that these stereotypes are actually not accurate at all, and all it does is reinforce stale perceptions about gender. I don’t see why for each and every one, the females need to be presented in a way that’s less appealing than the males, or why the stereotypes within themselves are so heavily anchored to gender when that isn’t necessarily the case to begin with. There isn’t any rationality behind it apart from lazy views about gender that belong in the 90’s, not the 2020’s."
INEEEEDIT,ff9cja4,t1_ff97pjn,1579709913.0,"Nah, most people I know want to smell good, and not like shit. These memes also almost always present women’s stereotypes as boring and lame while men are zany and quirky. That’s not the reality of the world we live in. Women aren’t lame. There are plenty of boring ass men. And smelling good instead of reeking of alcohol is most certainly a better alternative."

They’re not funny, even in the scope of “edgy humor” or “sarcastic humor,” or whatever it is people categorize this as. To your point, it’s not like you invented this type of meme, so there isn’t reason to solely dunk on you, but I guess I’m just a little disappointed this kind of post keeps circulating around, especially in a fandom for one of the few anime/manga series that actually goes out of its way to blow these stereotypes out of the water in the first place."

attackontitan,ff6d403,t1_ff5uo3p,1579624583.0,I’m not so sure if those memes are meant to be self aware. Nor am I very confident the people who read them and find them humorous interpret them as sarcastic either. It’s not like these perceptions towards gender don’t already exist and people don’t genuinely buy into them.

ShingekiNoKyojin,feire8u,t1_feh6u06,1579145299.0,"This is tangentially related, but the reason I started actively shunning the LevixEren pairing is because of the hypocrisy I saw in myself when judging the sexualization of kids. It creeps me out whenever I see people lusting after teenaged or prepubescent girl characters and pairing them with older male adults. So if that’s not okay, why would the Levi and Eren pairing be okay? It’s not. If the genders were reversed, I’d be disgusted, so I made it a point of duty to make it clear to myself and others that, just because Eren is a boy, doesn’t make that pairing any less pedophilic and problematic. The fans who ship things like this or who are okay with sexualizing kids should at least take a look at themselves and question why they support it."

ShingekiNoKyojin,feiq6pd,t1_fegpkxj,1579144463.0,"Maybe it sounds selfish and closed-minded, but I like to view Hange as female because there are not too many women in anime or media in general whose traits and appearance are as unconventionally attractive as hers yet are still respected and accepted. She’s insane, insanely smart, loud, brash, not classically pretty (though I think she looks good), ruthless when she wants to be, and has the makings to be a good leader. She’s nothing like the “ideal woman” a lot of anime and mainstream shows try to present, and I think it’s really refreshing to see. There should be room for all types of women to be showcased in stories, from girly, sexy ladies, to gruff, take-no-prisoners badasses, to a mix of both, and anything else in between. I think the inclusion of Hange serves as a great example for how  different types of women can be represented."

Why would a girl or woman who can fly, or summon any object she wants, or whatever trait that amplifies her physical abilities need to be taken easy on just because she’s female? The quirks should create more or less equal distribution of capability, perceived or otherwise, and variances in merit would be based less on gender and more on the quirk itself. The fact that these gender issues are present in a society where almost everyone is superhuman is weird to me. The opposite should be the case for SnK, where resources are incredibly limited, and backwards thinking of the roughly medieval time period would compound sexist views and rhetoric. But it’s not the case in that story (and I’m very glad it isn’t). If SnK can pull it off, My Hero simply doesn’t have an excuse."
