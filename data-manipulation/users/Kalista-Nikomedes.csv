selfimprovement,ff3k9my,t3_erc9wk,1579542840.0,"Even for me, someone who reads a lot, and who has read avidly for the last 15 years at least. I can retain and write a damn good book report after I read something for abooout.. two months? Three? Unless I loved it just that stinking much that it stuck with me so hard. Otherwise.. its basic stuff I remember. And that is with fiction.

Non fiction.. oh good god. I have to beat my head against books I even love, and then a week later I'm flipping into the book again, like.. it was *this* book right? I reread my nonfiction books like mad. I sticky note(because no way would I ever mark a book) I even take notes on my favorites, like the 48 laws of power, how to make friends and influence people, and others. and yet still... if my notes weren't good enough, I gotta go back for a reread.

So legit, don't beat yourself up over it. If you can remember specific points from a book 6 months ago, I'd be remarkably jealous."

Robert Greene's 48 laws of power. Legit, it makes interacting with people a very entertaining game. 

-inserts Master of Puppets- 

I... dont like interacting with most people. But, I started looking at interactions like a game. Because really, that's all life is. A game. I used to be a very closed off person. To the point some even believed I was a mute. But in all reality, I just.. didnt like to talk? However, learning the laws of power, body language and a certain collection of vocabulary really changes the game.

 You dont have to be fake, and changing things about yourself that do not fit into your goals is not wrong. If you dont change yourself to fit your goals.. now that's wrong. 

I hope you find yourself OP!"

selfimprovement,fe5sqet,t3_eno12m,1578874119.0,"Wrote all these suggestions down. 

I am surprised however to not see Robert Greenes books, 48 laws of power and the art of seduction. 

I initially wanted Art of Seduction after there was an episode on Psych that had a similar book, but 48 laws of power ended up bring showcased in a fanfiction group I'm in to boost confidence.

I admit, I have yet to finish it. Its.. stiff in some places, but i love that it has quotes from people of the past. Just little things i can write down and leave around my house for a little boost. 

It's a book on how to control power. I have always been one to watch it and enjoy being a bystander, but this book makes being in control sound.. entertaining as hell. Using body language, planning, staying out of the drama, you can even use the laws to stay hidden. But still control. 

Theres a lot of historical information from leaders and such. Cant wait to work on a new ""self help"" collection. Especially as another poster said something about so many self help books tending to end with "" turn to jesus"" bull. Getting reeeeal tired of that. Already get it from family, dont need it from my books too. Lol"

But um.. I buy multiples. So usually the first copy, is my share book. If I buy it myself. I dont let anyone touch my gifted books. The other copy, I share and have people write in. For memories sake, and because I like seeing peoples handwriting. 

I simply dont know enough people that like to read. But! I just got my lil bro into classics like Frankenstein and Dracula, and got him one if the young adult Sanderson books. Wasnt sure if he still read or what he liked. So I figured why not. 

Either way, seeing books that go through so much for memories sake is always cool."
fountainpens,fdbmsgf,t3_ehmfi7,1578258939.0,"Probably a really dumb question..

So, all I have are Pilot Plumix pens and pilot carts, but I'm wanting to get my boyfriend a pen now. I dunno if hell take it to work or not since some people Jack the pens. Buuut, either way we end up chilling at my desk writing out silly things with the plumix pens. But.. they're not very.. classy looking. 

My plumix pens/ink dont bleed if it's on decent paper, but.. is it the ink itself.. or the pen flow? Or both? 

I only have 50$ so, I'm just browsing around on amazon. But, I'm a bit confused.. I'm not seeing nibs like that of the plumix? Is it a different type all together? 

I've been looking at the wooden pens on amazon, because he loves wood stuff, but with that budget things seem.. eh. Not quality. Does any one have suggestions? Doesnt have to be from amazon. Just within 50$ preferably wood of some sort, if not just something that looks classier than a plumix."

fountainpens,fcpg9cf,t3_ehmfi7,1577862653.0,"I'm still pretty confused after researching. Need like.. specifics or just reassurance before I purchase things..

I have two Pilot Plumix pens. Super cheap but I dont want to go balls to the wall yet. I was wondering if I could use Converters for these pens? I found a guide on what converters work for pilot pens, but not.. specifics. Like it gave me a list if converters but not what specific pens they go to. :/ so I'm really confused on that. 

Also, I'd really like to try different inks and was wondering how to go about getting sample inks? I found on goulet pens site its 1.25 a sample, but I dunno if all the random inks would work? I've noticed a lot of articles say that some inks dont work for certain pens. And if i find a sample i really like is it simple enough to just.. order a bigger size if that exact ink? Like are they always labeled?

Currently I think I'm just going to try to journal with these pens, make sure I really like them and improve my handwriting before I go for something expensive. I currently just have 50$ to spend from christmas money. 

If I want to experiment with different inks more,should I get a dip pen? I'm sure they're much harder to use but I havent done much research on them yet. I like the looks of the glass pens I keep seeing, but are they worth it? Or are they just for pretties?

Sorry for the really noob questions."

Being fun/light hearted. Learn jokes. Legit.
I worked at a pizza place. Looked up a crap ton of pizza jokes and memorized them. Learn how to be snarky.

It's an entertaining read. ^_^"
fountainpens,fbld8lx,t3_ectmbg,1576961373.0,"Quite a few different questions..
So, I'm really curious about where people BUY their pens and ink and paper. 
Can you only buy online? Are there store names that might be near me (California of the US) that I can check out? I checked out a stationary store, but they didnt know. I 100% doubt theres anything up here in the north, but I'm wondering if places like Modesto or Sacramento might have stores?

How do you know if the paper can handle the ink? (<- asked this question at a stationary shop and they had no idea what I was talking about). How do you know what.. stock it is? I feel like I'm using the wrong word.. but if I want to use like.. fancy stationary type paper? Where do I get that? Are there places to get bulk stationary and envelopes that can handle the inks? (Was planning on using my pilot parallel pens for cards, but they dont dry at all. Waited three hours and it still smeared everywhere T.T).


Are there popular blogs that the advanced people who use pens read? Or any suggestion for a noob that isnt just a lady using brush pens? Or suggesting barnes and noble kits. I'm getting real tired of that. Being a noob doesnt mean you want the crappiest thing that looks like a pen. I'm not saying I'd say no to a Kit. Just not a super cheap one like what barnes and noble, costco, walmart or amazon sells. Amazon has a few, but they dont get good reviews it seems. (I did get all my pilot pens from there though)


I prefer to read though, so blogs are my preferred go to. But I want.. adult blogs. If that makes any sense. I want to take this seriously, and as much as I love lurking on the subs here, it's just not enough for me. 


I would greatly appreciate some guiding nudges from others who take their pens seriously. Thank you!"
