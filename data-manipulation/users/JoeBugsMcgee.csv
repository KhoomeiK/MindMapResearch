aww,ffeawsq,t1_ffe9yx4,1579841635.0,Id like to think of it as them just trying to get high not worrying about whether it'll keep them alive .
trees,ffdp6on,t1_ffdjx81,1579825676.0,"I totally get this. I had always been the one who had weed and gladly shared it. Back when I thought smoking a gram was an accomplishment. But as soon as dudes starting paying for it themselves, they never extended the same love back. 
Example :
I used to buy disposable vape pens and I'd pass it with my buddy till it finished. Once he started paying for it and realized it gets expensive, he'd give me a hit, and as his way of saying he's not sharing anymore he goes , "" oh I'm high , I'm good "" then would proceed to pull it out if a certain song came on or something. It made me lose my hope in people . Never been so hurt ."
