So that you would have had a taste of 4 different careers by the end of your sophmore year. Companies should be rewarded for participating with some kind of a small tax break otherwise no one would sign up for the program. 

Then beginning of your junior year, you take a career aptitude test and either have a part time job or summer internship lasting at least one month long or the whole summer. Seniors graduating should have the option for a gap year to work as well. Gap years should be an attractive metric for colleges, I don’t know why it’s not.
