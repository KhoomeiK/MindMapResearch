All of his close friends and some nobodies swore it was a heroin overdose. But I see enough Heroin addicts, unless it was his first few times, I couldn't see it. I was right though, he often had seizures if his he didnt take his meds. 3 months before his death he had a seizure behind the wheel and drove into a lake. Two off duty officers somehow saw it happen (seperate vehicles) and both jumped to rescue him. So I figured his death was because this girl ditched him in a regular episode of not taking meds. Turns out cocaine.... Bastard.... I love him though."
