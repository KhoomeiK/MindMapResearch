DreamInterpretation,fees1mn,t1_feemnw4,1579039986.0,"It could have a connection. If you feel that fixing things with the friend it would sort of fit the symbol of the snake. Basically biting the bullet so that you and your friend are square. But at the end of the day it's your dream, if that doesn't sound right then it probably isn't. If you do feel like talking to them would help, then why not give it a shot?

I'm not a psychologist or anything. Many people get stuck one a symbol meaning only one thing. But try googling different ways to interpret snakes or being malnourished, or being trapped in a box. But what you brought up sounds like a good conclusion to reach because talking it out with the friend would bring closure to the thing. Either you guys officially go separate ways or you are friends again. The only way to know is to try."
DreamInterpretation,feelggy,t3_eord7h,1579036149.0,"Snakes in dreams  usually have something to do with making a change. If we use old stories to help us understand symbolism, the dragon was a kind of snake that needed to be slayed to move on to a better situation. Satan in the garden of Eden offered forbidden knowledge for the chance to progress. The idea is that you sacrifice something for progress. Snakes can either be slain or ignored. If the snake was malnourished and kept in a box it's possible that something in your subconscious has been putting something off that it wants to get done. I know that I put off simple things because of anxiety or other reasons, but taking care of these ""snakes"" usually leads to a better and Fuller life."

exmormon,fedo0c6,t1_fed329f,1579016129.0,"Getting into psychology and studying things that actually helped me get over my problems led me to this conclusion. God is the ""capital s"" Self- the ideal Self, the ""higher power"" we each are our own Gods. 
Each religion has great myths, and stories to help us develope ourselves, but religion as a whole is a way people try to monopolize spirituality. Spirituality to me means becoming psychologically ""whole"". 
I think meetings with groups of people to share a way to ""worship"" is great. When Dogmas and authorities show up it's time to get out."

BipolarReddit,fe9bzsx,t3_eo4e0y,1578936202.0,"I had a dream night before last where people were disrespecting me and all I loved. Generally anything that pissed me off. I woke up and the first thing out of my mouth was ""fuck you"" to my roommate who just made an innocent joke. Told him I was sorry and isolated in my room to stop myself from throwing knuckles."
