They will also teach you about how to take care of your hair, wash and condition it, and will also recommend what kind of products to use. I’ve learned a lot about my hair I may have never otherwise learned. And getting your hair washed is a great feeling."

This period sucks. But if you practice self improvement,  good grooming habits, and respect those around you, you will no doubt be a catch."
