medicine,fftd9h3,t1_ffryvsd,1580217106.0,">In my mind actual harm was done to this patient

This is always my issue with these things. I do not believe it is my responsibility to juggle the well-being of my patients against professional social contracts and ""playing nice in the sandbox"". Every day we see people who have such distorted and bastardized understandings of physiology that they try to route patients down insane management pathways. Nurses documenting rigors on a post op patient who shook her fists because she was anxious... The number of acalculous cholecystitis consults we field in ambulatory patients with borderline thickness on US and basically no symptoms other than vague discomfort not associated with meals... people confound policy and allow it to dictate their actions, inappropriately lump diagnoses together, and generally misinterpret clinical data while misunderstanding what that clinical data is intended to do in the first place. 

I do not palliate nurses. Doing so is a direct harm to my patient if for no other reason than there is no benefit to my patient. I will attempt to educate but at the end of the day I'm not responsible for what they don't understand and my obligation is to the patient only."
