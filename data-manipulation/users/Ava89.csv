Damnthatsinteresting,fglfy0w,t1_fglcu47,1580895733.0,How are they stealing information on pricing strategy if they are just photographing things that are already out on the shop floor? Anyone could do that.

Would it have been that hard to type ""women""? It has less letters even."
fatlogic,fgifhad,t1_fgi71ag,1580819934.0,"It seems like in your example though, fat is something that can be overlooked if there is enough wealth status or power to balance it out. 

Going by your logic (which i agree with) fat is never attractive in and of itself, it's just sometimes a symptom of something desirable. 

Henry VIII wouldn't have been less ""attractive"" if he had been slim. But his fatness did indicate his wealth."
ScottishPeopleTwitter,fgi5q0x,t1_fghlrsq,1580806872.0,"It's not really self imposed if it was a way of surviving and find work though? That's pressure from outside the community, it's not like they just one day said ugh Gaelic sucks let's just speak English."
WTF,fgg21tb,t3_ey9l5q,1580752544.0,"Why is he whipping it? Poor horse, cowboy deserves a good kick for that."
AmItheAsshole,fgc7jkr,t1_fgba8a3,1580669958.0,Yeah but we're talking about a guy here. Let's see how many people bring up frontal cortexes next time a young woman does something stupid.
Anticonsumption,fg7srgy,t3_ex4siu,1580600550.0,Where are you seeing that ad? I'd go as far as reporting to ofcom if you're in the UK.

facepalm,fg62u5q,t1_fg620pn,1580550683.0,"I'm not going to read the whole thing sorry, can you quote the part which you think said gay is a gender?"
facepalm,fg61wt5,t1_fg61tvc,1580549312.0,"You're saying ""gay"" and ""lesbian"" are genders, i think you must be confused.

Gender is whether you are male or female. It's not sexual preference at all."
facepalm,fg61hbw,t1_fg5zx0a,1580548686.0,"Why can't you just be a man that likes painting his nails then, or a woman who likes short hair and not shaving? Why does deviating from stereotypes just push you into another stereotype?"
weddingshaming,fg4m1go,t1_fg4cf1s,1580506093.0,As an introvert that sounds like my absolute nightmare but congrats and I'm glad you all enjoyed it!
ScottishPeopleTwitter,fg3cu4q,t1_fg1y61f,1580478138.0,Far too much has changed in the 5 years though. Crucially one of the main reasons a lot of people voted no was they were worried about Scotland no longer being in the EU.

justneckbeardthings,ffw9hpz,t1_ffw7zy4,1580290953.0,What did you have for breakfast last Wednesday?
BoomersBeingFools,ffw7u4a,t1_ffvlic1,1580288481.0,Yes let's focus on someone just doing their crappy job instead. That's the real issue here.
AskReddit,ffw7d61,t1_ffv6f9y,1580287794.0,"The southern hemisphere isn't below the equator in any objective sense. The world map could be the other way up with the South pole at the top and it would still be correct. We're just used to it the way it is, but it doesn't ""have to"" be that way."

minimalism,fften7r,t1_fftbzj7,1580218329.0,"I don't see how. You asked if they could just not go out in heavy rain, what are they supposed to do when they have to go somewhere? That's just bad advice.

Fair enough you don't know the climate. It rains most days here, maybe 5 days out of 7. 3 of those are what I'd call heavy rain, except in summer when it rains heavy maybe once a week. The rain is a bigger problem than the cold here tbh."
minimalism,fft2s8t,t1_ffs0zjc,1580203995.0,"If they are in decent nick try donating or selling them. I also live in Scotland and what i have is

A North Face with removable liner which does cold and wet or just wet. It's also about a size too big (second hand) so i can fit as many layers as i need under it if it's very cold.

A long wool coat for formal wear. Again i can fit more layers under it for colder days. 

A fleece lined denim jacket for cold but casual days.

A leather jacket when it's not that cold (I'm not going to say warm because you know that covers like 3 days lol)

The bottom line is think about your layers under your coats. Many small layers work far better to keep you warm than 1 thick jacket. Maybe even get some thermals. And an umbrella. Your stuff doesn't all have to be water proof."
minimalism,fft2c6b,t1_ffs64ln,1580203302.0,">Is it possible to not have the two heavy rain coats and just not go out in heavy rain? 

I know you're trying to help but honestly think about that. Do you think anyone wants to go out in heavy rain?"
