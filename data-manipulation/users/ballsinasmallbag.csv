guitarlessons,fcag9w6,t3_egwja2,1577568711.0,"I think what you’re referring to is called palm muting. She basically strums the chord and then “palm mutes” the chord by putting the bottom part of her hand on the strings to make them stop sounding notes. It’s a good rhythmic effect that you should learn.

I know palm muting is often used in a different way but the effect is the same."

Sourdough,fc3vn4j,t3_eg213o,1577399791.0,Definitely. Give it 60-90 minutes in the morning after you take it out of the fridge to get the chill out. It will have a little better depth of flavor.
