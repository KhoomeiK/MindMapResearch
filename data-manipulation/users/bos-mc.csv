I think the big issue is the whole doomsday factor of these messages.

No matter how many times you write this, it's not true. They adapted it for a Western audience. That's not to accommodate a white actor. I'm pretty sure ScarJo would have been fine playing a Japanese character that has the appearance of ScarJo."

That's what it is in the source material. Should this character also be played by a Japanese woman? https://i.imgur.com/uTiVMt3.png

That shell is made by the same company that made the Major.

> Your last point is the thing I wanted to drill down to: the entire film industry is catering to a white males with white protagonists in whitewashed films because they say it’s “easy”. It still flopped because there were too many changes to make it palatable to white audiences. It deleted/degraded all of the Japanese/Asian culture and eastern philosophy to cater to that same audience. 

The aim of Hollywood is to make money. The best way for films to make money is to make them appealing to as many people as possible. The original Ghost in the Shell is a niche idea that most likely wouldn't do very well in the Western market.

> Why do you think the target audience was solely focused on white people? It was going to release internationally.

Most of the major markets are majority white? Europe, Russia, Australia etc.

America is the largest audience and the primary target for this movie. China is a wildcard and would probably prefer that the lead is changed from Japanese. Japan would watch the movie anyway because the source material is Japanese."

Maybe they'll do that in a sequel, who cares? They're adapting the source material to a Western audience. Why would they change a white shell to a Japanese shell when the target audience is majority white?"

It's pretty clear all you care about is people of colour being cast rather than the actual point of the story. 

If ScarJo spoke Japanese in the movie would that have been enough? Obviously they're going to change a few things to make it more relatable to the West. The Japanese name being changed to a Western/English name is because it's being watched by Westerners. Asian-Americans speak English in the West too.

Kusunagi Motoko is still in the movie, played by a Japanese woman. Mira Killian is an alias, given to the white shell. Her rank is Major, which is why she is referred to as Major. The whole point of the movie is that she loses her identity.
