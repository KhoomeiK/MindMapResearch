fatlogic,ff0xdmd,t1_fey5phs,1579473229.0,"not neccessarily, could be simply not double checking the calories and going with guesstimates. It's very easy to underestimate calories.  
for example, the toast bread I got recently has 121 calories per slice without putting anything on it, just the bare slice. plenty of people would think such a small piece of bread without any nutella etc wouldn't be more than, like, 50 cals. I knew I'd have back when I was fat (and things like this are the reason I was). If you take two toast bread sandwhiches, that's already an underestimation of 280 calories, and that isn't even counting what else they put in the sandwhich. And two sandwhiches the size of toast bread aren't exactly filling, at least to me, so they eat something else as well.

I got the message that probably meant the pkunk were dead at the same time I got the message that the other guys vanished.  
hell, they said something about an cup-shaped system with a name like c....a wich was an anagram of ""asterisk"" (or something similar as that doesn't even have a c, didn't know back then you could reverse conversations and the infodump was a bit too much all at once) which I still haven't found and I thought they needed that to survive, but no.

The hefty time limit does not allow for any exploration.  

honestly, the time limit is what I'd consider the biggest flaw in the game. I know that you old fans see it as a positive, but I just can't. even with the wiki I'm in a bad situation, I can't imagine how it would have been without any outside help.
