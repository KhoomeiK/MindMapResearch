linux,fdkigpn,t3_els1r8,1578504485.0,"So here's the thing about this. I like KDE (I've been specifically using Kubuntu on a home lab system for over a year, and recently bought a Lenovo t440p laptop that is also running Kubuntu). I like the customization of it and how 'accessible' it feels.

But only to a point.

I would consider myself a windows power user. I am very familiar with and comfortable with making changes to, setting up and deploying Windows based systems.

However, there are certain every day things I can do in Windows that require a far sight more involvement and unfamiliarity in Linux. An example of this was the above mentioned laptop? Was loosing network connectivity completely after 30 minutes. Naturally I thought, ""Okay, this might be a power saving bug"". But going into the control panel and checking the network options? There was no option to disable power saving mode. So a Google search showed me the file to edit, sudo nano, no big deal and bam done. After one or two reboots.

Now. The problem with this is, if I have clients who are *not very computer savvy*, this becomes a problem. Explaining to someone to make changes through terminal who already has enough issue remembering that their password is `password` presents a very real problem.

It's the one single area where Windows shines. You had a click path to follow that could easily lead an end user to fix or at least report to you a possible issue.

Now while I might understand some of you would say, ""You can setup a remote session"". Again. Not very computer savvy end users. Individuals who wouldn't even understand who to use Join.Me.

So while I would firmly enjoy to see Linux, even KDE/Plasma stepping up to become a perfectly workable home environment for the every day end user? Until it has a click through interface comparable to Windows? I simply don't see it realistically happening.

Edit: While I thought I had fixed the issue with the laptop? Turns out the thing is now outright loosing the entire network subsystem after x amount of time. Like more than an hour. Which means apparently it's not fixed. Sigh."

And yet, I still remember the morning I awoke to a shrill CRY followed by sobbing, bolting from my bedroom and banging on her door. Upon being let in? Her legs, lower half of her bed, the sheets, were absolutely SOAKED in blood. And I don't mean a little.

I mean a lot of it. I remember having to get trash bags and put on gloves to carefully wad up the now dripping comforter and sheets, only to reveal the massive puddle that had soaked into the mattress itself.

Working together, it took several hours of blotting, with vinegar, to get that stain out. Eventually she gave up, had someone pick up the mattress the same day and bought a new one.

From that day on, she started wearing pads.
