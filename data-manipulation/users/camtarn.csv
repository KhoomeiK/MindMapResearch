Well, I have three - the Strat copy that I started out with, my £50 pawn shop SG, and the beat-up old acoustic that used to belong to my mum. But the Strat copy is out on long term loan to somebody else because I never used it after I got the SG.

Never really got the multiple guitars thing, other than maybe an electric, an acoustic, a 12-string, a resonator, etc. I lucked out when I found the SG - turns it it's almost my perfect guitar. I wouldn't mind a few additional features on it, like a Bigsby trem and maybe a locking nut, and I really should get it properly set up, but it does me very nicely.

Cooking,fgh7u5h,t3_ey7kvy,1580778724.0,"Taking part in a big outdoor theatre event, I decided to make flapjacks (granola bars, not pancakes) for the twenty or so people in my group. The event lasts about twelve hours, from costume and makeup to the end of the afterparty, so I figured people would get hungry. I budgeted for two large flapjacks each.

I found a recipe online and scaled it up to forty flapjacks by eye - about two pounds of oats, one pound of sugar, half a pound of dried fruit, half a pound of golden syrup, etc. I grabbed my big glass baking pan and poured the oats into it to make sure they would fit. They did. Cool.

As I melted the cooking fat, added golden syrup, added sugar, added fruit, I started to get concerned about the sheer volume of the materials I would need to fit into that pan. But surely it would be okay: all of the extra stuff would fit into the space around the oats, right?

It did not. I ended up with two big pans of flapjack, about an inch and a half deep.

It'll be fine, I thought, and turned the oven on for the indicated 45 minutes. 45 minutes later, I checked the oven. Pale uncooked flapjack. Crap - the extra mass and thickness meant that it was heating up slower. Cook for longer. Twenty minutes later, the flapjack looked the same, but all the fat had bubbled up to the surface and coated it in a quarter inch of bubbling fat. Extra crap. Poured that off and cooked for longer. Another ten minutes and the flapjack had finally browned.

By this point I was late for costuming, so I threw the pans of flapjack in a bag, with towels to stop them melting it, and headed into town.

Two hours later, after helping everybody else into costumes and facepaint, I remembered I needed to cut up the flapjacks and put them into a bag. Took the pans out and tried to cut into them. *Clunk.* It was like attempting to chop wood with a butter knife. After trying various things, and nearly breaking my knife, I eventually found that I could extract small amounts of flapjack at a time by smashing the handle of a wooden spoon into it like a pickaxe. I spent the next half an hour mining for flapjack. I ended up with sore muscles, a bag of loose greasy granola, and half of the flapjack still baked rock-hard onto the pans.

And in the end, somebody else in my group had made a bunch of wraps, so the most anybody had was a small pinch of granola. I was eating granola for a week afterwards...

\---

Then there was the time that my partner and I decided to make a Mexican dish using roasted poblano peppers. Neither of us have a very good spice tolerance, but we were told poblanos were very mild. Being in Scotland, poblanos weren't easily available. So we substituted regular green chili peppers... a large double handful of them. The resulting dish was delicious, but so spicy that our noses were streaming and eyes watering. We had to eat icecream alongside it in order to finish it."
