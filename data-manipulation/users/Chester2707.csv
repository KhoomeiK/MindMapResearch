Austin,fffm6kw,t1_ffefbx0,1579886955.0,"I'm from Houston and just really don't get Austin's problems with traffic. Yeah, it's bad. Sure. But the distance you need to go is not even remotely similar and frankly I don't think it's really that awful. I get on 35 often, I used to take Mopac daily, I work in town so I know the congestion there too. I really don't get the bitching about Austin traffic. It's bad, but despite our reputation and rankings among some outlets, I really don't think it's near what people say."
politics,ffe6yct,t1_ffdl61x,1579838345.0,"Yeah. When I graduated I had friends who wouldn’t vote. They do now, but I often think about how many of those people there are. I don’t love Matt Taibbi, but I think he had a profound quote in his 2004 campaign book which was roughly “people say America is divided, but really America mostly doesn’t give a shit.”"
pics,fez88gh,t1_feyc8z6,1579454720.0,Just had the exact same realization. I’ve seen this picture a dozen time and I’ve never noticed. Wtf?
funny,fez7rgn,t1_feylwn7,1579454565.0,Yeah. I used to watch an outrageous amount of soccer. It’s not even a question. 100% faking it. You can always tell.
food,fez6u55,t1_fey2b44,1579454391.0,Yep. Now I have a boner. Thanks op.
Incorgnito,fez5san,t1_feyj0oc,1579454058.0,"Well that’s very good news, because it’s adorable. Makes them look cartoonish."
TexasPolitics,fez33rs,t1_fewqe8o,1579453438.0,"I worked for a candidate who was facing an uphill battle in one of those districts. We saw the crisis up close, and we lost the general by 10 in a good year. To suggest they vote to perpetuate this awful situation is 100% correct. I’d love to help, but they don’t seem overly interested. It’s almost like their votes are tribal and based to racial animus rather than focused on literally fixing this disaster in their midst."
aww,fez1erm,t1_feyflnx,1579453026.0,He definitely looks excited to play which would suggest he’s comfy where he’s at. Best of luck and thanks! Everyone should adopt and rescue.

politics,fenohzw,t1_femwr0o,1579288584.0,"Yeah, and if he’s to be believed, they’ve spent lots of time together and dinners and meetings. No surprise, Trump is obviously fucking lying."
politics,felxnp2,t1_feksuje,1579233544.0,"I mean hasn’t he sued a whole slew of people? My work recently made me aware of the term “vexatious litigant” and I wonder why know judge has deemed him as such. You don’t need to be a lawyer to be labeled that, which is important because he’s clearly too fucking dumb to be a lawyer."
politics,felxfqf,t1_felcg8p,1579233377.0,"Tbf, 60 million Americans picked Trump so it doesn’t necessarily always apply. But yes. God she’s the number one senator I want to knock off this year."
politics,felrw7p,t1_felph62,1579229418.0,Ah yes. It should be as simple as him just telling them how to vote. Not sure why he hasn’t thought of that.
politics,felrisw,t1_fekq61b,1579229167.0,"Schumer has always been with liberals like Brown and Sanders wrt trade. This should not be surprising. I get Bernie’s folks are ready to shit on any “mainstream” Democrat whenever they get a chance, but maybe they’re not all evil! Some might even share your views!"
Austin,fecp8c8,t1_feccqle,1578979762.0,I really don’t get the hate. I think it looks fine.

aww,fdyyua5,t1_fdxy895,1578784932.0,"Weird question - I know many animals like this are severely problematic for ownership. A member of my extended family has a bobcat because she’s fucking stupid. That said, doesn’t domesticating an animal just require ownership over many generations? Like, weren’t wolves just shitty for a while before they acclimated?"
TexasPolitics,fdx2m65,t3_en778a,1578764640.0,"I was at the Supreme Court when this picture was taken. I took a picture of him while he looked right at me. I don’t think I did, but in retrospect I wish I had mouthed “fuck you” in that moment."
politics,fdu00sq,t1_fdsdr4l,1578725079.0,"I’m not trying to be confrontational at all because I want any democrat to win. But I’d like to know why someone like Bernie is preferable to someone like Joe (who I think is a bit of a clown) when the reality is we won’t win the senate, whoever is hypothetically elected will be neutered, and no structural changes are possible. If you accept that explanation, the data shows Joe is our best opportunity. I know that might feel like an attack but I genuinely want an explanation."

AmateurRoomPorn,fdpofke,t1_fdoixqx,1578634608.0,"As a person who had no real feelings for the city before meeting my partner 4-5 years ago, I would just say it’s one of my favorite cities ever. It’s hard to describe why, and maybe it’s where her family lives (Lincoln park, basically), but I haven’t had anything but a fantastic time there. Visit if you can."

TexasPolitics,fdozuug,t1_fdoocuo,1578616668.0,"That's a hilariously stupid comment, but okay. I don't know if you're from there or what, but I am, and again, that's a stupid comment."
TexasPolitics,fdoi38q,t1_fdofdzy,1578605590.0,"The weather sucks? Central Texas gets hot, for sure, but otherwise I'd rate it way up there in terms of honestly most of the country. 
The politics of Texas suck (imo) and I have issues with local stuff here, but it's all fairly progressive, so if that's a problem for you, I can't help. 
The rest of your points can be addressed by living in the right areas (which admittedly takes a good income) and then you can avoid our poor transit, you can bike/walk most places, and you don't need to leave the city, thus avoiding whatever shitty culture you're referring to. Also I'd like to point out you made exactly 0 arguments as to why engineers specifically would not want to live here, but that's beside the point, I guess."
TexasPolitics,fdof09z,t1_fdo96of,1578603868.0,"What sort of engineers are you referring to? I personally know some, including petroleum who live in Houston, who want to move here. Otherwise, I see exactly zero reasons to see why an engineer wouldn’t want to live here. It’s not for a lack of opportunity, unless you’re talking about strictly chemical/petroleum, which is uh, not most engineers."
