Veterinary,ffo0k9r,t3_eu48bw,1580072913.0,"It’s a complex issue. Yes, you should get paid more/ I agree. (I’m only addressing US). No, no one forced people to adopt pets/ we only BEG them at every point we can. It adds to the person’s well being. There is no one else who will do it/ charities are tapped out! 

You could say the same about going to vet school- no one forced you. Let me add I went to law school & have the same issue- so I am not being condescending. 
I honestly admire you all for going and know you had Nobel intentions! I did & still do. I’m sure you do too. 

Part of the real problem is the human heathcare system. It’s crazy here. People die from lack of it. So, people often can’t afford that, much less taking their pet to the vet NOW. This is the majority of the population in the US. If you think it should just be whoever can fully afford it/ great- More people & a lot more pets will Suffer & die. This is how it’s set up. I don’t think vets or docs should be in that business. 

That’s reality. I agree with pet insurance/ they need to make it better. I agree to change our heathcare system- then we could afford to fix our pets! I paid over $10,000 last year on myself, I have Good insurance. I paid over $6,000 on my 4 pets, they give me a discount. I’ve done without my meds when my dog needed 2 surgeries. I have a good job, decent salary. But with loans, could be better. Oh- one of my pets literally picked me- kept coming to my house, begging to be part of the pack. This is a complex issue that is larger than salary. My job is the same.  I should get paid more, but I am helping people who can’t afford to help themselves. 

I’m just saying, YES you need & deserve more money. But it’s not a black & white issue of “people don’t have to get pets” (some Get too many yes!) or “they should be able to afford them” - 2 unexpected surgeries puts all but very top in a bind. It’s complex."
aww,ffjyolc,t3_eokyfc,1580010598.0,"I honestly don’t understand why people don’t believe me or just listen to the suggestion to FIND out about the foster system. I’ve worked with the foster system. More than one state. I have the education. You can look it up yourself and see that kids are Dying. Is this how you live with yourself, by denying it? I understand some have difficulty, but that is not everyone. Just educate yourselves. I’m advocating for children here!"

He not only slept with women for YEARS without me knowing, he took my money! Right when I became too sick to work/disabled from incurable, progressive genetic disease! He planned it out. Heâ€™s still trying to literally starve me out! I took care of him & even financially supported part of his family for years. I took care of other people too. 

Your IGNORANT, cruel, overly judge-mental  post actually made me cry because I am physically ill. I have the right to make a joke or find humor in whatever I like. I also have the right to be forgiving of others- itâ€™s NONE of your buisness. Because clearly you arenâ€™t capable of understanding that people are Complex. Or do you enjoy upsetting sick women who found a little laugh after SO much sadness? What does that make you other than a shitty, ignorant person, as you said? Youâ€™re a jerk."
datingoverthirty,ffd311a,t1_ffblk83,1579812426.0,"Great! Perfect! Good job, honestly. Lucky kitty :) 

Some people treat pets like little humans. They attribute all these human motivations, etc. They also turn the pet into what They want it to be. Not picking on the particulars, but youâ€™ve seen little dogs in sweaters in a purse being carried around all day. The dog has an attitude and the owner has no clue why or attributes it to a complex human emotion/reaction - heâ€™s afraid of tall blonde men who wear red. ?!?! Thatâ€™s what I meant. People who put their own emotions above the poor petâ€™s. They mostly donâ€™t mean to do it! They believe what they are saying. They just donâ€™t educate themselves. 

Iâ€™m thrilled you are Not one of those people. Sounds like you are a great, sane, responsible pet â€˜momâ€™/owner. You should feel proud of that- because many people donâ€™t understand pets. Whatever reasons you need a ESA for,  I hope your skill in this area helps."
datingoverthirty,ffd0ns8,t1_ffbl9xv,1579811098.0,"I agree! Dogs (and even cats) Love having a job! Iâ€™m Sorry, I didnâ€™t mean to disagree with this. People who use their dogs for jobs- they ARE treating them more like a â€œdogâ€!  ESA is a job, I agree. Especially if you teach them the way to react or do something so they feel they acted. 

studies show that working dogs are happier- they have a purpose, they know they contribute to their pack, and even their food tastes better when they work for if. That IS taking care of your pet- to give him/her a job. I have to come up with all kinds of things to make my dog feel like he accomplished something. Heâ€™s a  born work dog. No argument, only support for this !"

Just thinking about it. 

I understand why some very young men (?18-21) feel like anything over 30 is OLD. I did too! Only when I grew up did I realize itâ€™s better to be a grown up. I donâ€™t want to be in my 20â€™s again. You donâ€™t Lose something, you Gain! Some young men donâ€™t understand that yet. Itâ€™s a little sad, men who think itâ€™s all over after 25.

I could fill pages on what I looked at on this subject.  You shouldnâ€™t assume things.) I know how the system works. 

I do NOT mean that you donâ€™t know anything or canâ€™t form a valid opinion! Iâ€™m giving you more respect than you gave me. You can educate yourself instead of just assuming things like what you just said. Just go look for the truth. If I told you, you would not believe me anyway. But if you really go look for yourself- on that subject & story, include many sources such as multiple newspapers, interviews, etc. Look for what you can know for sure & what you donâ€™t. You can watch a documentary and double check what they say- see if each thing is true or not. You seem curious and questioning, which is great. Just use it to look for the answers.

Further, a few times when the KKK endorsed someone who disagreed, that candidate immediately went public against them & the KKK withdrew their support. He did NOT do that. If anything, he has used language to encourage them. Heâ€™s complex, not just trashing him.  I am addressing this part."

Sometimes if a woman just ignores you while walking, she may be thinking hard about problems & what she needs to do. I have actually not heard someone before. (Not the case here, just explaining) Iâ€™ve occasionally pretended to not hear someone who wasnâ€™t just â€œtrying to talkâ€ but sounded like they were cat calling, loud, or trying to sell me something. :) 

On the other hand, people think I work in practically every store I enter! I have no idea why. Iâ€™ve never worked retail. Then, I try to solve their problem! Itâ€™s hilarious. Iâ€™ll find the stupid item, explain rewards programs, find a employee, even look up things on my phone for them as if I work there:) 

maybe you should try that! Excuse me, do you know where the X is located?  Sounds sincere! ;) then apologize- oh Iâ€™m sorry, I donâ€™t know why I thought you worked here. Youâ€™re dressed far too nicely, obviously a professional, etc. ðŸ˜‰"

Tops too) ; Target (look for good reviews, softness, tips from ladies above)- usually PJ bottoms that I wear as shorts or joggers; Dillardâ€™s has nice sleepwear, soft but I love the gowns for sleeping when away from home; Kohlâ€™s sometimes; other department stores or designer brands online when on sale. I wear casual tops or nice T-shirts with cute sayings. I never wear T-shirtâ€™s outside my house unless exercising but I should. This way I wear them:) 

I also have at least 3 hoodies and many cardigans- perfect if I go outside.  Sketcher or similar shoes seem to be comfortable for me. Shoe Station has some nice, comfortable brands also, great with coupon. 

Love the other tips too, now I want more."

Or I would try to change the topic to them. Iâ€™d usually say something like I havenâ€™t met right one or I wasnâ€™t ready for a divorce yet, then ask them how they met their partner or about their kids. I know they mean well, but amazing how they think itâ€™s polite to ask questions like that yet if you asked them why did you marry him or have that kid, they would probably be offended. ðŸ¤£"
ScottishPeopleTwitter,fdhhbj5,t1_fdftabu,1578422645.0,"Thanks all. Iâ€™m going to get a streaming service then:)  Britbox or Acorn maybe. 

Iâ€™m glad the license isnâ€™t easily enforceable for the sake of poor, pensioners, etc. 

We also have PBS. Itâ€™s free, but not as many good shows. They survive by donations and selling popular programs. NPR is also excellent, but radio obviously. Great podcasts, shows. NPR is one of the only news sources here that talk about more than just the US! Itâ€™s crazy how little most US citizens know about any other country. But most of media here relies on ratings, so I assume that explains it:("

ScottishPeopleTwitter,fddxlhv,t1_fddv2ai,1578326435.0,"Thatâ€™s mad! The advertising here is not looking as bad. :) Cable televisiÃ³n here (US) is very expensive if you get movie channels, but regular tv stations- local ones, are free- just need antenna. Even In rural area, you can get 3-10 channels. We have areas in my state that are very poor- so thatâ€™s all they have. Internet is expensive too here. The poor have to use it at the library:( 

Selfish question; what is a good  BBC streaming? Iâ€™m addicted to Peaky Blinders. Iâ€™m sorry to ask, but I appreciate it."

I suggest you try to do that, if doctor agrees. Get heart rate steady and reasonable. Then see how some caffeine affects you. Good luck."
british,fdc0fab,t1_fcxq5dm,1578264711.0,Thatâ€™s probably  why New York is huge and so well known! Because your fellow hometowners cared too.

I DO agree with your point that itâ€™s hard to judge this guy off this one night. Not because they had sex though. It was just so easy- which is FINE, I am NOT slut shaming!! Women can do anything we want! But i donâ€™t think he has proven that heâ€™s â€˜wonderful for asking to kiss you & bringing you water. My point, up your standards. Expect men to treat you well! You deserve it! Donâ€™t expect less than this ladies."
AskWomenOver30,fczrybi,t3_ejmra4,1578107603.0,"There are lots of misconceptions about this subject. Look it up. Many women enjoy it. Can depend on if they are built to enjoy it. Others donâ€™t or just arenâ€™t willing to try/put off by the idea. You are not automatically damaged! Porn starts do extreme things & HOURS of it! Just saying that people like/donâ€™t like different things. Everyone should only do what they Want to do, of course:) But this is not something as uncommon, perverse, or new as many women think. Men & women have done it for centuries. I guess I just hope no one is shamed because they like it. Or donâ€™t like it.

british,fc9onsp,t1_fc7vdv1,1577555850.0,"I have NO IDEA! :) Iâ€™ve wondered the same thing. keep in mind they did this a Long time ago. ðŸ¤£ Maybe they were towns where the founders were from? I live in a town named after the founderâ€™s wife. (?) Louisiana, especially, is filled with French cities & has parishes, not counties, like the other states. Their laws are different too. Of course, the further west you go the more Native American titles. Alaska and Hawaii almost feel like different countries. 

I grew up in the only remaining Utopian town. The founders did some â€˜wildâ€™ stuff for the times. Itâ€™s on a bay- they had a casino on the big pier, a large steamboat to cross the bay to bring tourists from the larger nearby town,  swimming, stories of skinny dipping, all kinds of things. To this day, you technically do not own the land!! Itâ€™s colony land, leased to you for 99 years. Can be renewed/passed, really in practice itâ€™s the same as owning land. But the title has remained the same. These utopians had some interesting ideas. 

So, we are just a physically large country that varies since we have very different people. Hard to explain why some of my countryman do many things. Especially past couple of years or so, just embarrassing! 

By the way, after watching Peaky Blinders I Can no longer say Birmingham the way US people do. I can only say it the way they do on show ðŸ˜‚."

Related- the town of Arab, AL is pronounced A- Rab. The name is a mistake. It was suppose to be Arad, the first name of a founder. Online says the post office made the mistake. However, the story there is that someone painted the water tower & misspelled it, so they changed the name of the town. ðŸ˜‚"

Life,fbq7346,t3_ebyzsh,1577028920.0,"I wish I understood why so many seem to be â€œdepressedâ€, etc. Yes- people have been depressed/ADD, etc forever. If you study history- you will see generations prior to us went through SO MUCH WORSE. I am not downplaying global warming or any other issue!!

But imagine WW1 & After. For the first time the Whole World, basically, went to war- never happen before in modern times. More new countries were changed/invented  immediately after it than ever before. Governments changed dramatically, new forms were invented. Most countries had serious economic crises. Thatâ€™s what soldiers came home to. Plus, they just saw things & places they would never have dreamed of seeing! (No tv, cells, computers, Crap cars being invented) If you look at the books, poetry, governments, religions, being invented & rise of atheism, you see a generation lost, dazed, PTSD, confused about what anything really meant anymore. 

Yet, they did things. People suffered. But wow did they do things!! Pushed new governments,(yes, & another WW), causes, workers rights, built businesses, invented like crazy, etc. They took chaos and molded it into the the basics of what we know today! They found purpose, even if it was Just daily Survival- that IS a cause!! 

Just saying, today is unique, yet it is not! Embrace your advantages and get busy. Find your purpose! Weâ€™ve all had to find one. Once you get busy, this other stuff will be less noticeable and easier to deal with."
