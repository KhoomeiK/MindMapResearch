loseit,ffo4vgx,t3_euauf4,1580074197.0,"Hey stat cousin, glad you're on your way! Everyone uses their own techniques to lose the weight, but here are a few I'll share, since you asked:

- Keep an apple in your purse/car/desk drawer. A personal favorite of mine for when snack time rolls around, if I'm not hungry enough to eat the apple, then it isn't really snack time yet. 

- Get a box of white strips for your teeth. The expensive ones. Are you feeling like you're white-knuckling that drive home, past all the fast food places in the first week or so? Toss on a white strip. You're not going to tear off $4 worth of dental goo for a frosty. 

- if you miss the gym, it's okay to be disappointed. But think of it like this: that one time you ran out of body wash so you just skipped the shower before work didn't mean you gave up on showers forever. It's okay if you miss it. Maybe do those ""never"" chores to get your heartrate up at home later, like dusting the ceiling fan or cleaning the wall behind your oven (it's that just me? Lol)

- losing weight is SLOW and when you're grinding and doing everything right for a month (especially if that one month weigh in is on shark week) and you're only down 3lbs, it's rough. Don't give up. EVER. You binged 3 days this week? You haven't worked out since last Monday? Those aren't failures, giving up is the only failure. Try making mini, daily goals. Get 30 dollar bills each month and give yourself a dollar each day you get your goal- new leggings fund when yours get too big or worn out from consistently crushing it in the gym. 

Obviously there's a lot of good advice floating around on the internet. The most important thing to remember is to never give up. You're worth it! Give yourself grace when things don't go right, and be proud when you're doing awesome! Talk to yourself the way you'd talk to a friend or family member (sometimes we can be so harsh on ourselves) and know: YOU GOT THIS!!"

loseit,ffc89js,t1_ffc3vv5,1579793810.0,"Also, think of all the success stories we see on this sub. I've never seen a ""I'm a normal BMI after finally losing 150lbs!"" post that reads, ""Well, luckily everything worked out this time. I started Monday, the first of the month, and ate -1000cals without fail, PR'd every time I went to the gym (which was every day without fail) and never once did the number on the scale go up even .1lb. Thankfully it all happened just right or I'd never be where I am today!"""
loseit,ffc7a9a,t3_espifw,1579793180.0,"Try to frame your big goal as merely the guideline, instead of your main focus. Here are a variety of examples, hopefully one hits close to home:

- To get a college degree, you have to get credits unrelated to your major. Pointless waste of time? Sure, when your major is all you focus on. But with your degree being the ""big picture"" those stupid generals are your focus- which do, in fact, get you closer to your goal of graduation. 

- To save money for a vacation, you'll budget and spend accordingly. If your focus is saving money for the vacation, then everytime you pay a bill, you're failing. If your focus is sticking to your budget, then the saving still counts as meeting your big picture vacation goal. 

- Playing a video game: really, how is running around a map, opening boxes or killing 1hit creatures advancing the game? If you're focused on finishing the game, you'll miss out on the EXP or items gained from running around. If finishing the game is just the guideline, and you turn your focus to playing, then you'll end up with all the secret goodies and actually finish better than had you just run through all the bosses.

- Learning a language? Your big picture (being fluent) is broken down into bits, which are what you focus on. First, words, then phrases etc.

Try making a goal each day that will put you in the right direction, and just crushing today's goal. And also remember, 2 steps forward and 1 step back is still moving in the right direction. 2 steps forward and stopping is... not really doing any good lol

Anyway, if nothing else, just know there's one more internet stranger rooting for you!"
loseit,fesr3dt,t3_eqen0f,1579368120.0,"Any long time loseit users notice a yearly trend in kind of mean and unhelpful comments? I'm wondering if it's a new year's thing: more people dropping by = more mean spirited comments. I've seen more this week than in the last few months, and I'm wondering if it's like that for a while but then will get back to the normal, uplifting commenters after a bit. Any one notice this?"
fatlogic,fesffcg,t3_eqi4rp,1579364580.0,Doesn't it take more time out of your day to manage T2 than it would have to track calories?
loseit,fepit96,t3_eq4tq9,1579321598.0,"Thanks to pinterest, people have forgotten the beauty of a thermos of soup for lunch. Sure, all the beautiful meal prep bento boxes are great, but really, get yourself a thermos. Find a recipe for some barley or lentil soup (pretty easy, meat and dairy free) test it out and you're good to go. 

For fast breakfast, I like to core an apple and put peanut butter in it, then just eat it ""whole"" (so I can walk around and eat it and not have to fuss with slicing...)

Also there are these lunch packs that you put in the freezer and it's like, the whole thing is an ice pack- those are awesome for carrying some veggies around in your car. Realistically if you're baby-steps into cutting out ""bad"" food, at least you can have for example a little bag of carrots, celery and radishes (that's my lazy ""chop and go"" trifecta) to crunch on before you eat the foods that aren't so great for you. 

These are obviously not everyday things, but that's my 2 cents anyway. 
You got this!

Edit: okay, I talked about fast food, but you mentioned ""bad for me"" food and not fast food.... whoops! Fixed!"

loseit,fdon8le,t3_emenc4,1578608602.0,"Would weekly planning help? You can incorporate new recipes but if you just [for example] sit down on a Sunday morning and plan your weeks meals, track the calories, and then just eat what you planned, then you're only ""counting"" calories 1 day per week. And if it's not on your list, don't eat it. And if it's like a Teamsters Sandwich (30 Rock, anyone?) aka something unplanned that you just can't pass up, just expect less of a deficit or a maintenance that week... (Slight gain, even, if the food is too good to pass up..Most foods will not be worth making every week a maintenance week)

That said, I'm merely suggesting this because you stated that counting calories worked, but if there's another option that's better for your mental health, you wouldn't be alone in losing weight without tracking the numbers. You'll find something that works for you!"

For the other example, 5 8oz red bulls is about 550cal, a mcdouble is 390, footlong chicken sub about 640, dinner and snacks let's just say 800.... we'll round that up to 2,400... tdee for lightly active 6'2"" 166lb guy is 2479 calories to remain that just-under-healthy weight. 

So assuming this dude isn't a 7' athlete, just regular guy from her second example, that checks out... but it's no 6,000 calories."
