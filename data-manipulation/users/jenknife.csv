loseit,fffp35n,t3_et8rkz,1579888723.0,"I totally get this!!! This happened to me at work. I lost weight and one woman in particular kept telling me she was “worried” about me and that I looked great and didn’t need to lose weight-insinuating that I had low self esteem and an eating disorder. I finally had to explain that my blood pressure was out of control and other private medical stuff just to get her to shut up. I just assume that the majority of people have a weird relationship with food and some sort of body dysmorphia otherwise they would not be so confrontational when someone is making healthy changes. 

Just stay on track and feel free to tell people that your weight is not a topic of discussion."

MealPrepSunday,fdmvyvq,t3_em49ed,1578568354.0,Finding all these food prep pics inspiring. I have fallen off track with it and it really is the best for busy people trying to eat healthy. Awesome work! Congrats on baby #2!
Dermatology,fdhcvsp,t1_fdh95s3,1578420113.0,"Yes, I went to an allergist, got tested for everything and nothing came up. Just try skipping your toothpaste for a week and see what happens."
SkincareAddiction,fdggwi2,t3_ejka2b,1578396267.0,"I get super dry/sensitive skin in the winter. I wash my face every night, religiously, with olive oil, wipe it off with a clean, soft towel and then use just a bit of chamomile cleanser to rinse off any remaining oil. I finish up with a few drops of argan oil, rubbed in for a minute and a dark spot remover oil that I use because I have some sun damage. In the morning I only cleanse with micellar water on cotton pads, put on some more argan oil and then my liquid makeup mixed with a little Butter Drench cream. Completely fixed my skin. I find less is more when it comes to dry/sensitive skin. Hope you find something that works for you!

Edit: Congrats on the little one!"
Dermatology,fdgge44,t3_el29x7,1578395610.0,"I was having something similar to you for years and it took me forever to figure it out. I stopped using minty toothpaste and it immediately went away. Any kind of mint, spearmint etc was causing it. I now use Tom’s of Maine fennel toothpaste and have had no issues at all. But I can’t use anything minty on my lips or in toothpaste."

AmItheAsshole,fctgd4n,t3_eirba7,1577942392.0,"NTA. My husband drapes the clothes he wants to wear again over the side of the hamper but sometimes the same thing happens when he tosses his clothes in from across the room. I just wash all of it and he gets irritated. I just don’t care.

Also, “dumb bitch” would have turned me into a whole other person. You were so amazing to calmly leave with the kids. Good for you."
Libertarian,fcmf9qj,t3_ehqwll,1577773106.0,"“Texas gun culture” would mean the church would turn into a wild west shoot out because everyone would have gone to church armed, thinking that makes for a safer world. What actually happened was that the church smartly had a security team and cameras and were able to stop what could have been a huge body count. Liberals are not coming for your guns, just looking for common sense restrictions to keep the most people safe."
loseit,dt0hx96,t3_7rvodt,1516549266.0,"I have worked at gyms the past 20 years and yeah, you cannot take pictures of anyone or anything at the gym.  Most of the time this is in your original contract.  Also, you should mention something to the staff because people like that should not be able to ever access this facility again.  All gym staff know how difficult it is for people to start working out.  This kind  of thing infuriates me.  Stick with it and keep being kind to yourself.  What you are doing is really difficult and I think you are awesome."
