FFVIIRemake,fgiuw9w,t1_fgirr70,1580831438.0,"Nah it was really just an amazing moment, I can without a doubt say it has ALWAYS been my favorite section of disc 1, if not the entire game and was the first thing on my mind when the remake announced.

It's not about the dress believe it or not, it's about how off-color and envelope pushing it was, even as 12 year olds we knew it was different. Cloud didnt just put on a dress, you had to go through hell and high water to get the things for the dress, which included going to a brothel/whore house complete with hidden scenes of all sexualities doing/saying crazy things, cross dressers in gyms, etc. Then when you get in Don's mansion you might end up NOT being picked and thrown in a room full of dudes who ""zombie walk"" to you. And for most of us we didnt realize till the second or 3rd playthrough that the ""zombie walking"" dudes were indicative that they were about to gang bang you. 

Its all insane and as the years went by the topics this section handled are just now becoming big, TV and movies are just now getting into majorly representing the LBGQT community in media and in that regard FF7 was AHEAD of it's time with that topic, but as people have gotten more sensitive over the years it was a quandary if this section would be kept because it was so envelope pushing and representation and all that.

You have to remember this game was one of the first RPGs most people ever played so when we went through 7, then played other RPGs it's like this was a moment that no other game even ATTEMPTED where the MC had to go through such precarious means to achieve a goal.

kakarot,fg4k9yu,t1_fg39ya3,1580505009.0,"Yeah when I say seperate I mean I felt like launch the nice girl was one person and launch the bully was another, they shared the same body and soul but they were 2 sides of one coin with different goals and tastes (i.e bully launch is in love with tien, quiet launch is cool freeloading at master roshi's), and like you said 1 ""slept"" while the other was awake, that's how I always saw it.

But a personality change more so says to me that blue launch sneezes and she inverts, her hair flips from blue to yellow And her niceness swaps with her bully mentality, but she's still launch as in blue hair launch is in love with tien but as blue hair those feelings are suppressed but when she inverts to blonde launch those feelings surface to the fore-front. Or when someone threatens blue hair launch she has suppressed anger that boils over when she switches to blonde. Which is a far cry from what I originally thoughy.

I guess my old way of seeing it was 2 people legitimate people on opposite sides of a coin while the personality is more like 1 complete person with 2 extremely different lifestyles battling for dominance. But someone just told me she was inspired by people with schizophrenia and as a huge fan of the movie ""split"" which caused me to do a good amount of research, I'm surprised I didn't realize this sooner."
