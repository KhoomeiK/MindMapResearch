I've found that as I've got older the existential dread is harder to fight off. I've done the 10 on 10 off, working 30hr weeks, fun jobs, intense but useful to humanity jobs etc etc. But the main thing I've learnt is that if I have too much time to think I get miserable. Because essentially the world is a random mess and you are bobbing on its surface.

AFAIK there's nothing wrong with me it's just that any rational thinker will come to the conclusion given enough time that the only sane response to the world is some form of insanity to pass the time. Workaholism? Why not. Anything to keep the baying noise of the truth of the matter at bay.
