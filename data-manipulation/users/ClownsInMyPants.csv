It doesn't matter where my dog is, she'll ignore me the whole day. I could fake cry, she wont move. But if I actually cry,she always knows and she will come over and get in my face and ""attack"" (with licks/kisses) and will literally hug me,(lay her head down on me) to make me stop crying. She wasnt taught this, shes not ""around"" this all the time to somehow know what crying is. But She knows...and this is how she reacts. It's always with love.

Its like second nature for animals yet some people would rather ignore the sick and leave them to rot.

I know not every person is like this, and I know not every animal is like that either, It's a mix of beauty to see such love from an animal and sadness to see people among us harbor hate for something they dont understand.
