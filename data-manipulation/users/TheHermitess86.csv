depression,ffafr0s,t3_eshka7,1579734699.0,"It’s amazing how mental issues like depression seem to manifest more physically than mentally. For the longest time I thought there was seriously something wrong with me like a brain tumor. But after multiple trips to the hospital and them not finding anything, I realized it was just my anxiety and depression. I can’t remember the last time I woke up and actually felt rested. Usually I have enough energy to walk my dogs, feed them breakfast, and then feed myself breakfast, but then I’m ready for a nap already. There are so many things I need to get done around the house, but I just don’t feel like doing it....and that just makes me more depressed....it’s a never ending cycle"

mauramurray,ff9yzbm,t3_esa6sa,1579724521.0,"Another Good Samaritan option is that somebody picked her up while she was walking along the road & Ended up successfully driving her to whichever location she wanted to go to. Considering that part of the state has a big tourist industry, it’s possible the person didn’t live nearby and therefore never heard that she was missing.

Maybe Maura didn’t want them to drop her off directly at her intended destination, possibly for safety reasons. I know when my husband has taken taxis or Ubers in the past, He doesn’t have them pick him up directly at our house because he doesn’t like the idea of them knowing that I’m home alone. Perhaps Maura was the same way & Had them drop her off A few miles from where she wanted to go & Something bad happened between there and her destination."
mauramurray,ff9ygd7,t3_esa6sa,1579724212.0,"The Juan Pedro Martinez case is really sad. The boy looks like a sweet kid.

I think a Good Samaritan case involving Maura could have several possibilities. Like you said, someone could’ve offered her a lift with absolutely no ill intentions and then she died in the car from injuries related to the crash. But I just don’t see why they wouldn’t have driven her to a hospital or rescue squad or something like that. It’s not uncommon for an accidental death to have an attempted cover-up, but there’s usually some kind of ill intent involved.

For example, maybe two friends are drunk and they get in a fistfight and one of the guys falls down, hits his head, and dies. Of course the other person didn’t mean to kill them, but they still indirectly caused their death. With Maura, if someone was just giving her a lift in their car, there would Likely be no shady business Involved that Would make them scared to take her to the hospital. The only thing that could possibly make them hesitant to take her for help is if the person had some kind of police record, not necessarily a violent offense.... it could just be drug-related. Then they might be fearful that police might try to put it on them, thinking that they’ve escalated In the severity of their crimes.

One theory that always sits in the back of my head is that perhaps somebody hit her while she was running along the road. There wouldn’t necessarily be blood evidence to show that someone had even been hit on the road. The injuries could just be internal. Then one of two things could’ve happened: Either she was dead right away and the person panicked, loaded her into the car, and drove her off to hide her body. Or, she was still alive but died sometime during the ride in the car and then they just hid her body"

depression,ff996zp,t1_ff7uaa6,1579707733.0,"Friends like that are the worst, although you can’t really call them friends. I had one like that.

But when I’d contact her about something serious, like when I was hemorrhaging blood, she didn’t seem to care at all. I finally cut all contact with her and I felt so much better. You just gotta cut out people from your life if they’re toxic like that"

depression,ff6opya,t3_ern1iv,1579631700.0,"That’s probably the big thing for me too: The lack of motivation. I haven’t invited my family over to my house in probably three years because it’s so cluttered from me not tidying things. I mop and I vacuum and do stuff like that, but I have stacks of mail that I haven’t gone through and Easter decorations still up since last year and that sort of stuff. I want so badly to clean it, but I just can’t get myself out of my chair. I look at the mess on my couch where I can’t even sit anymore and I feel overwhelmed. My mother makes the problem worse because she’s constantly sending over stuff that I don’t need like containers of plastic eggs and cheap rings for a kid (i have no children). I don’t know why she does this and I’ve asked her to stop, but she won’t."
depression,ff6nzss,t3_ersyw1,1579631262.0,"My mother doesn’t seem to realize that she’s one of the main stressors in my life. When she starts to really wear on my nerves and I lose my patience and basically tell her to just stop irritating me, rather than try to stop what she’s doing that’s bothering me she simply asks me if I’ve taken my pills. It pisses me off because she thinks she should be able to continue irritating me and I just have to suck it up with my pills. 

But she’s always been like that. Everyone needs to respect her feelings and her problems, but F everybody else’s problems and feelings.

Plus, when I was a kid, she would always make jokes and I would sometimes be offended by them, and she would just tell me that I needed to learn how to take a joke."

depression,ff6n379,t3_erqjbv,1579630714.0,"I’ve had that day dream since I was little kid. I always wanted to be in the hospital and I don’t know why. I even went so far as to exaggerate an illness and pretend that I was in way more pain than I was in the hopes that they would keep me in the hospital.... of course they didn’t.

Finally, I did end up in the hospital for about a week with pneumonia when I was in fifth grade. But I didn’t like it. After that, I stayed out of the hospital until last year when I had to have a small surgery. And that time I loved it. Mainly I loved it because I had quiet time to myself without having to deal with The stressors in my life. I told my family to stay away, that I was doing fine and I would be out in a couple days. I didn’t want any visitors. 

I enjoyed laying in the hospital bed late at night with the lights down kinda low. It was surprisingly relaxing and peaceful. Oddly, the night nurses I had were all male, so that was kind of exciting. My husband has never really been caring or comforting to me, so I think that’s why I enjoyed having the guy nurses because finally I had a male figure taking care of me and showing me the compassion that I really desperately wanted.

The day before I ended up in the hospital to get the surgery, I was literally collapsed on the floor in the living room screaming because I was in so much pain, and my husband did nothing. He wouldn’t let me call an ambulance. But he wouldn’t drive me to the hospital either. He wanted me to drive myself, but I convinced him to let me take a taxi instead.

Glad to see I’m not the only one who has this day dream/fantasy. I was thinking there was something seriously wrong with me in the head, haha"

Now I have moved on to Winston from the Scottish series “still game”.

When The neighbors called the police to report the accident, they would’ve told dispatch that it was a female driving the car and then that information would’ve been relayed to the policeman that was dispatched to the scene.

As for her hair, it could’ve easily been knocked down in the crash by the airbag and her face smashing into it. Or she could’ve taken her hair down after the crash to check her head for injuries.

I’m not too familiar with part 1 and part 4, So can’t really comment on that. NHLI? New Hampshire league of investigators? Are those the private detectives that the Murray family hired? 

I really think people are making this case more complicated than it needs to be as far as what happened. All this talk of staged car crashes and tandem drivers to help her flee to Canada.... Sure it’s possible, but most cases are not that elaborate. So I would be really shocked if this ends up being anything bigger than her going off into the woods and freezing to death, or her being grabbed by a passing motorist."
