 Only once he was told by police that the victim submitted to a rape kit and there was physical evidence – including semen, back, and neck bruises (from choking) – did Bryant admit to having sexual intercourse with the victim. His defense was that strangling women during sex was his “thing” (though not with his wife) and that while the victim had not given verbal consent, he assumed based on the way she kissed him he had consent for rough sex that left the women severely bruised. When asked how hard he was holding onto her neck, Bryant answered, “My hands are strong. I don’t know.”

Her blood on his shirt is some kinky bdsm for just meeting. Also, more importantly, he was also....married. Another fine example or morals and ethics. How Americans loves their bread and circus."

Some that you do not see until many occasions with a person to see how the perform when they need to put someone else before their own needs, outside of any drug experience. Some assholes only care about their trip, their vibes and no one else. I am sorry about their behavior. It would be best to let them go, remember that you were only trying to help your friends, despite the situation and misreading of the situation(large dose). Therapy may help, but this may take some time to heal, both physically and mentally, but your spirit, your spirit is stronger than theirs and most will ever be. Namaste."
