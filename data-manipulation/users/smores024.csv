That being said, if you decide not to that’s also totally fine and up to you. But I don’t think that you should worry about her life because she made her choices."

college,fa9g30d,t3_e844gm,1575872326.0,"So I’m a sophomore in college now and it honestly fluctuates SO much for me... first quarter of freshman year I gained a fair amount of weight in a short period of time (ended up getting stretch marks and it really messed w me) and second quarter I lost over 20 lbs in ten weeks from stress and ended up at a lower weight than I started. 

It hasn’t fluctuated that much since but definitely still fluctuates."
