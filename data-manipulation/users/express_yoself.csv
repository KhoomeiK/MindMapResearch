aspergirls,ffhcvr9,t3_etfz6z,1579930242.0,"Things I've tried:

-Make a picture schedule and keep it somewhere I'll view when needed.

-If I need to be somewhere: figure out how much time is needed to get there and get ready. Then set the alarm for that time so I can get ready in time.

-Keep a daily calendar so you know where you need to be each day. Check it daily.

-Make a list of tasks you need to complete that day or a written schedule. Do easy things first and as you go across off what you have done."
relationships,ffh96n5,t3_etef3t,1579926734.0,"1) Why does he have many so many social media accounts? What is he already hiding?

2) Social media is not real life. It's like getting attention for different things you wouldn't necessarily be provided with in real life. Personally, I've deleted my facebook, instagram, and snapchat accounts because 1- it led to an unreal emotional relationship with someone while I was already in a real relationship with someone. I wasn't living in reality. 2- I suffer from anxiety disorder and by deleting social media accounts it has reduced my symptoms drastically. Deleting him or your account still doesn't help with reality.

3) Be honest with what you are feeling. Do NOT let him feel like your feelings aren't worthy or don't matter. You will lose yourself if you do."
ABA,ff8co4r,t3_es2nmv,1579673078.0,"Hi, I've been in ABA 3 yrs. Before that I was a preschool teacher and also tried out being a para or aide at a school. The school didn't teach me anything about behavior. Burn out was real-Time lasted 6 months and went back to preschool teaching before I found ABA.

When I was a tutor or worked 1:1 with the kid I was very exhausted. However, I was learning and felt great. I loved ABA so much that I decided to get into a MA program (already have BA) to learn more just after 6 months of working in the field. Once I was in my program I was transitioned into a lead manager position but other RBTs also could qualify for the position. I then had flexibility in my schedule and could make it myself. I am currently a program director and studying for the license exam. 

Ask yourself these:

•is this your job or your career?

•if career, where do you want to be in 5 years?

If you need vacations ask. If your mental health is suffering take personal or sick days. You NEED to take care of yourself.

Additionally, I too have trouble thinking about work at home and during the night. I tell myself this: ""it is MY time right now"" and think of things I like or do something I like."
Marriage,ff8ax84,t3_ervs8e,1579671323.0,"Hi, my (28f) husband (27m) and I were married pretty young. We will be hitting our 4th anniversary soon. Here's some back story:

I was in taekwondo (TKD) at 13yrs old when I first met him. I left TKD around 15 and came back when I was 18. At that time we were the same belt level and we were training in a team of 4 people to be able to attend black belt testing. During this period we became close. Now I just started community or junior college and he was a junior in high school so I was looked down upon from my friends and family as well as his family when we started dating.  

We dated for 3 years. Then he proposed and we were engaged for 3 years. We were married in 2016. 

We are from a catholic/Christian upbringing and were again looked down upon by our family and one of my close friends for moving in together before being married. We lived together for 2 years prior to being wed.

I will say my husband and I have a unique bond most people will never get. We went to community college at the same time (I was sick a lot and did not know what to major in so took longer than expected), we went to the same university, like I said we do TKD together and went through very difficult black belt testings together, we are in the same field of work, we both went to graduate school and earned Masters degrees, and we work at the same company. 

We also went through many happy times such as raising baby Guinea pigs, a kitten, and a puppy together. 

There were also hard and sad times such as learning one had cheated on the other and the other talking to someone else. We went through a miscarriage together. My husband also almost died last year. 

There are MANY reasons why and how we grew together. These are just the main points. We never gave up on finding ourselves and working to know each other better. We definitely grew stronger in our relationship. We are still together due to the CHOICES we made and the time we put into the relationship. 

May I ask what is your culture?"
Marriage,ff8944d,t3_es6j7y,1579669627.0,"Like other people said taxes and commitment. 

Commitment is difficult for people and marriage signifies a lasting relationship until death. Through al the ups and downs that person will still be there.

Also my husband (27) was very sick last year to the point where he could not communicate his needs. Since we are young we don't have paperwork on file for what happens if he can't communicate. He was in the hospital for over a month. If I was not married to him I wouldn't have been able to talk to the doctors and tell them what I believed was the best route. His parents (divorced) could only argue and their son would have been dead if I was not there.

Lots to think about."
socialanxiety,ff6t2ag,t1_ff5lhfl,1579634301.0,"Yeah I would find something I like to do. Writing online is an option. In the meantime do you drive? If so, Lyft could be an option for work too."

ABA,ff5bi5f,t1_ff5auee,1579586225.0,"I do have ABA wizard and unfortunately did not get through alm the content areas. I should keep using that.

How many mock exams did your school give you? Do you know where I can find similar ones? I tried a couple from an ABA mock exam site but they were unlike the real exam.

Thank you for your input!"

taekwondo,ff0r3e4,t1_ff0mte0,1579471492.0,"I agree that vitamin D is needed. There are many other sources of food to provide that. Of course, you should really consult with your doctor before any changes in diet and exercise if it's for your health.

 I also didn't mean cut out dairy and carbs completely- that's my mistake. I meant just lower the intake of both. Yes, I also agree that sugar intake can be problematic. 

Also water and sleep are key! Staying hydrated can help significantly and sleeping the same and enough hours each day."

taekwondo,fewktml,t3_eqftdj,1579412969.0,"Hi I am (28f) a black belt in TKD. I started when I was 10. I have left and come back to the sport on and off over the years. I just started back up again a few months ago after a 5 year break. 

Before that break period I was about 165 lbs for 5'8"" and in okay physical shape but have asthma and was constantly sick. 

During the 5 year period I underwent many mental and physical changes. I experienced a lot of anxiety and made dietary changes and started doing yoga. I lost a lot of weight and went down to 128 lbs. I decided to gain more weight and got up to 135. During this time I also was going through physical pain from my anxiety. I also stopped exercise completely for many years and hurt my spine.

Now after being through many traumatic life altering events, I've made more adjustments to my diet and exercise for my mental well-being. I now weigh 175 and am losing inches like another poster stated they did but not the pounds because I am gaining muscle.

If you are trying to lose weight I suggest cut the carbs and dairy. I constantly eat throughout the day so ensuring I have healthy snacks available is a must. Of course I also binge on crap food too. As of now, i try to do a yoga class 2-3 times a week, I'm trying zumba (new for me but hurts my knees), and tkd once per week. Before going back to tkd I was doing a leg, arm, and ab day at the gym. Like you stated- I also hate it. However, they are very beneficial. I will be adding in those days again soon. 

The best way I found to lose weight and get rid of stress is to do cardio. 

Happy Movin!"
