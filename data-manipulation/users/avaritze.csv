raisedbynarcissists,ffhkg8a,t3_eti2td,1579939403.0,I can relate. I won’t say to my worst enemy the 10% of the things my mother said to me. I felt genuine hate and pure disgust from her. That’s why I left. I couldn’t handle it.

13 yo me was already deeply depressed and thought I won’t live past 25 because I would’ve killed myself. I’m turning 34 soon. Too old to die young and too much if a pussy to pull it off now."
depression,ff5kk5i,t3_cml6ni,1579597322.0,"You think too much.

This is what I hear from many people around me including my therapist.

My question is then always: is it even possible not to think any given time? My job requires me to think and, oh yeah, I’m a person with things to think and worry about. How do I stop thinking other than by blowing my brains out?

Nobody has given me any clear answer yet, except for “just stop thinking about things! XD”

Yes. Thank you I’m cured. Why didn’t I think of that? Silly me."
depression,fewp72j,t3_eqpqzk,1579417402.0,Man i feel this in my bones. I agree. Exercise doesn’t help shit. It’s just a distraction like eating or smoking imo. Good thing is that when I exercise i get to be depressed in a tight body so i hate myself less. But no it doesn’t help with depression.
depression,femoczw,t3_epy9c8,1579264614.0,Are you okay now? I mean as in do you need any stitches? I hope those are not too deep. Please look into your wounds and if you need medical attention please seek one. It’s heartbreaking that you are going through that.

depression,fd282lu,t3_cml6ni,1578143166.0,"I relapsed.

I was self harm clean for 26 months. This time it was worse than any of the past incidents. This time the scars would be uglier and totally non concealable.

I feel so broken, lost, out of control. Tears would pour out of my eyes like I am now full of tears and it’s spilling out of my head."

depression,fcike4o,t3_eh6aac,1577664030.0,"Sorry that I talk about myself a lot on this comment. That said, here we go.

I agree with you somewhat. It’s like taking a red pill and never being able to see the world as before. After several “epiphanies” I’ve come to realize; no, life has nothing worthwhile to strive for. I thought I was seeing the world as it is, unlike some delusional people who believe in gods, love, justice, etc. I really thought I was one of the only ones to see this fucked up world as it clearly is.

I’m easily around top 5% of the world population considering I am now writing this on my iPhone 8 in English where English is not a first language, waiting for my appointment at a hospital where I have nice insurance coverage because I have a job and I live in a country that provides affordable national healthcare. I have fucking AirPods and iPad Pro. If that doesn’t scream privilege, I don’t know what does.

Nonetheless I know I have depression not just a realization, because none of this makes sense. I have everything that a person might need and whenever I find things insufficient, I have power and resources to change it, but I’m still battling against suicidal thoughts, urges to self harm, and suffocating sense of frustrations daily. Judging from what I have, I shouldn’t be like this. 

I’m not trying to persuade you though. Even my doctor suggested having religion maybe because my depression seems to be resistant to meds and cbt therapy. I don’t know, maybe you’re on to something. I hope it’s that simple."
depression,fc56vvm,t3_eg8n9n,1577446279.0,"Yes. It’s like whenever I realize I am mildly okay or god forbid borderline happy, my brain goes “oh you happy? OH YOU HAPPY HUH?? Let’s fucking see, dude. Let’s see motherfucker.”"
