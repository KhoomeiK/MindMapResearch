news,ffdanrd,t1_ffd97r8,1579816759.0,I want a house with plenty of land. That costs money. My family is bitter and full of alcoholic abusers so yea I would rather have the money to start my own family instead of be around them. I get that it’ll never be enough but I would rather aspire to more than look around and say this is enough. Fast cars and land is all I need and that shit is expensive so I’m gonna keep grinding until I get there.
news,ffd8ngv,t1_ffd6rvn,1579815575.0,Technology can only take over so many tasks. No company has employees just to make them work 8 hours a day. If they could get rid of workers they absolutely would. Money let’s you buy things you want and to pay for services you don’t want to do. I can’t imagine everyone just getting what they need and that’s it. What a boring bleak world of just enough. If I didn’t work so much I would get another job to just make more money plain and simple. I would love to work less hours and make the same amount of money but that is unrealistic. Doesn’t matter if you have free time and no money to do anything with that time.

news,ffd2ytv,t1_ffcv0i5,1579812393.0,You have never worked in a busy office. People don’t work long hours because it makes them look good or to get ahead. There is a lot of work to do in certain departments with strict deadlines. I fucking hate it but I’d hate how little money I would make working 24 hours a week.
Documentaries,ffd2mzz,t1_ffd1q6h,1579812205.0,Science can say fucking a cow is ok doesn’t mean it’s morally right. The reason it should be absolutely considered immoral is not everyone is going to get genetic testing and the outcomes of these kids(not to mention an overall reduction in IQ) are horrid. Inbreeding is a compounding issue. After multiple generations the issues become worse. I won’t even link anything because this is common knowledge.

Documentaries,ffcxdhd,t1_ffcwv9m,1579809245.0,Going back 100 sum years everyone in my family has married and had kids with someone unrelated to them. Beyond that I would have no way to tell. But it hasn’t happened in 100 year in my family but people actively are doing it today. The majority of deformed or genetically defected children in the UK are birthed from ME families.

news,fevqq2o,t1_fev6pyb,1579400372.0,The legal system isn’t perfect but if there is overwhelming evidence that you are dangerous you should never walk free again. A lot of crimes are one offs and I get people can get back on track but imagine what goes through people’s heads with they kidnap some. They are planning and know what they are doing is wrong. Toss them in the kennel until they are ready to be put down.
news,fevc606,t1_fev2r1a,1579395671.0,It’s up to the judge to make that call but normally repeat offenders and some violent crimes can warrant denying bail. It’s not really set in stone and I doubt that guy can get 15k to pay his 10% down
science,fevbmcj,t1_fev93k2,1579395447.0,"Sorry about the grammatical mistake oh no. If you can’t spend 30 cents on a condom you can’t afford to have sex. What do you need to educate people about that having sex leads to having a kid? Are people really that ignorant? I would buy condoms for a anyone that was too poor to afford them but like come on I’ve missed some chances on having sex because we didn’t have a condom and it’s not worth the risk and extra possible costs. I guess this is why these people are poor and stay poor, they don’t have a damn bit of wit about themselves and the fact they pop out kids like they do is pretty scary."

science,feuag02,t1_feu8ha5,1579384691.0,I don’t even know how you could stop the poorest from having so many kids. It seems like you get penalized in this world for being able to take care of yourself. In a world of legal abortion(I know it’s not legal everywhere in the US) and various forms of contraception it’s only because these people are too stupid that they have kids which scares me what the future will look like.

UpliftingNews,fehumvh,t1_fehtn38,1579124199.0,That’s because it’s a constitutional right. If you haven’t committed a crime why should you be treated like a criminal? Mental wellness checks? Right because that would be super effective and not ripe with abuse. Just look at red flag laws. If you had a falling out with a crazy ex they could just claim your a danger and your rights are then gone with no due process. Until the constitution is changed it will always be pretty easy to buy a gun if you are not a felon.
UpliftingNews,feh7v2p,t1_fegwhye,1579110964.0,You need to pass a background check to get a gun and pistols must be registered with the police. People have been asking to get access to do these background checks for private sales but the feds said no.

I’ll be making more soon because I worked in my field through college and when I am 26 I will be just fine by myself. I don’t need to pay for other people to have kids that end up just as dependent as them. Is nature this forgiving?

aww,fdsz1f4,t1_fdq80fz,1578709799.0,So you admit you need them. I don’t like how cops act but don’t act like they serve no purpose. They get away with a lot of shit and I do not respect them as officers. They are people doing a shitty job and deal with the worst of society every day. You draw your own gun escalation. You call the cops escalation. I’d rather have my own gun in the fight I get your point but the legal system sucks their dicks like their nut is the point of life. Don’t hate the player hate the game. The system is what needs help not your local kid trying to do the right thing. I would like everyone to serve as an officer like I would like everyone to serve in a restaurant. Perspective gives you more knowledge than your bias could Munster.
