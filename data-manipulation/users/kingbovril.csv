Also to be fair to Snake in MGS4, when we see him without his muscle suit he's still built like an absolute tank... like to the point where someone as aged as he was would probably need to use steroids to keep that muscle mass.

As to Big Boss, he was also a 2-3 inches taller than Solid or Liquid and had a bigger frame in general.  I remember hearing that Kojima told Shinkawa to make him more Schwarzenegger-esque in MGS3"
