BelgianMalinois,ffcds8q,t3_esubdr,1579797285.0,If he had caffeine he needs to go to the vet immediately. That is poisonous to dogs. Even very small amounts can harm his organs even if he isn’t currently symptomatic. This is a vet NOW situation. Soda has many chemicals that will harm dogs.
autism,ferq053,t1_feqix5v,1579357032.0,"Your comment is both condescending and demeaning. 

 These are only two examples of tasks she performs and absolutely not the full scope of her training. Your original point was to say that any dog is capable of this and the video is not indicative of a trained behavior. I explained that it was a very complex behavior. 

I will not defend the fact that when I’m compulsively itching that I’m not aware of the behavior because you seem incapable of understanding anything outside of your own very narrow point of view. Instead, have some examples of other tasks my dog preforms that I couldn’t reasonably overcome on my own. 

She also does seizure alerts before a seizure occurs by detecting a hormone on my breath that I can’t smell and can give me enough of a warning that I can sit down or take emergency preventative medicine. This is imperative because my doctors don’t know the source of my seizures and other daily preventive medication hasn’t worked for me. I can’t use willpower to overcome my seizures. 

She does counterbalance so when I get faint or dizzy she can prevent me from collapsing and I’m no longer wheelchair bound. She’s prevented me from getting fall-related concussions on several occasions. I can’t practice mindfulness to cure my damaged equilibrium. 

She gives me blood pressure alerts and warns me before an episode of tachycardia so I can go rest instead of faint. Intentionality cannot correct the damage to my vasovagal nerve in my heart which causes it to beat erratically. 

She picks up dropped items like the leash because I can’t bend over without intense physical pain. I could get surgery to replace both of my knees but my soft tissue is so damaged that it’s unclear if I would be good candidate according to my doctors. 


I’m not a precocious child who wants to bring my puppy with me places and found a way to make an excuse to do so. 


I have life threatening physical illness and my team of doctors agree this is the least invasive treatment to give me back some quality of life. Yes, I trained some additional tasks that add to my quality of life that aren’t life saving. 

 A service dog has helped me in so many ways but there is nothing in the world that can make you less abrasive and demeaning."

He calls them cheese crispies and doesn’t melt the cheese or wet the cereal but does mix it around like the worlds most depressing trail mix.
dogswithjobs,fen8tkn,t1_femk8zk,1579279482.0,"Yes actually! I trained that so she can differentiate what I’m asking for if there are multiple items on the ground or on a low shelf like at the grocery store. I can’t bend over without getting dizzy or vomiting, so this is very helpful to me. She used to just, pick up and hand me whatever was in the general vicinity of where I point, so the specificity is pretty important."
autism,fen88dh,t1_femkqmu,1579279119.0,"Hi OP here. My background is in animal behavior and learning and I’ve been doing dog training for almost 15 years so please allow me to explain the significance of what’s occurring in this video. It’s a series of trained behaviors and it’s easy to miss the steps of you don’t know what you’re looking at. 

You are both partially correct and incorrect. 

The dog does not understand stimming behavior with the nuances that we do as people. You’re right, she isn’t worried I’m going to hurt myself or that repeated motions are indicative of distress in me. This is a conditioned response and the hand movement is the cue for the behavior. What the dog does understand is that when she touches my hand when I’m compulsively scratching myself, or prevents me from scratching myself by putting her head between my hand and my leg, she gets rewarded. She gets rewarded if she responds like this consistently and if she will be persistent if I don’t respond initially. You may think it’s just automatic that dogs will do this in general but the persistence and the consistency is where you’re wrong. 

An untrained dog may be interested when I move my hands, but will likely give up if I don’t acknowledge them and since it wasn’t rewarding, the dog will likely not try that again. Consider this scenario: dog touches hand > hand does not pet dog > dog does not get what it wanted from hand touching > dog doesn’t try that again eventually. This is called extinguishing a behavior. If an action does not produce a desired result, a dog will generally give up and try something else after a few attempts. However, if we capture an offered behavior and reward specificity, you can create a consistent response without requiring a verbal cue. 

The specificity comes in when the dog is only rewarded by very specific behaviors. She will not be rewarded for touching my hands just any time, and will not be rewarded if she paws at my hand, mouths my hand, or taps my hand once and walks away. She is only rewarded when she touches my hand while I’m itching myself obsessively, and if she keeps doing it until I stop itching. Consistency in training this and building duration, adding in distractions, and repeating the behavior in a variety of settings creates a consistent response where she will interrupt a behavior in hopes of getting a treat and her trained response benefits me. 

This behavior is the product of pairing a series of trained behaviors with a reward for the dog. I first taught her to touch my hand by using a marker word (“yes!”) that I paired with her getting a treat. I would offer my hand, if she interacted with it I reward the interaction. When I could pair offering my hand with a verbal cue (“touch”), and she consistently touched my hand with her nose when I used the verbal cue, I added in motion of the hand. Placing it on my leg, or my arm, but held my hand still and rewarded her for repeating the desired behavior of touching my hand when asked. At this point, I started ignoring any behaviors that weren’t what I wanted specifically. She would try pawing my hand, or licking my hand, or barking at my hand and if that didn’t get a reward, she would try something else until she did something that gets her a treat. When she consistently touched my hand no matter where I held it, but did not offer any other behaviors such as pawing or licking, I added the hand movement and used my verbal cue, and rewarded the touch response. After several repetitions, I phased out the verbal cue and tried the hand movements and rewarded her for still responding. Then I added duration by not immediately rewarding only her first attempt but rather allowed her to try again once or twice before giving the marker word and a treat. Over time, the dog will learn to keep offering the behavior until indicated to stop, or until the desired response of receiving a treat occurs. We then repeated this training in a multitude of settings to help her generalize the behavior. 

So yes, you’re correct in that my dog is not aware that compulsive scratching is a sign that I’m distress or that she’s worried about me. Rather, this is a series of conditioned behaviors that use a hand signal instead of a verbal cue. I just chose to use a hand signal that I do involuntarily when I’m distressed and trained her to respond in a way that is beneficial to me. The significance however is that she will respond to this hand signal consistently regardless to what else is going on around us, and will continue doing it until I stop."
