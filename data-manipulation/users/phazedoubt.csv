AskReddit,ffyclmn,t3_evkh4n,1580343220.0,"While out out on a delivery for Domino's, I rear ended an Accura MDX and totaled my car. I got a ride back to the store and my ex bil brought me a car to borrow to finish my shift. The very next call I took was a large order to a hotel. I get to the hotel and there are a bunch of girls in the lobby/sitting area. I asked them if the ordered a pizza and they said yes. I started to tell them about the night I'd been having and they were all very apologetic. Then all conspiratorially one of them says he needs to go up to the room. I had no idea what that meant but I was very excited and down for that. So they call up to the room and tell them that I'm coming up and to pay me up there. I go up and knock on the door and it opens and a cloud of smoke rolls out. I walked into the hot box and there were several girls up there in pajamas of various types and I was excited af. They ended up giving me a big group hug and some kissed me on the cheek and then they gave me a $50 tip. They invited me to come back and hang out with them later which I did that night and the following one that they were there."

Its amazing how similarly I perceive their behavior towards the president and their SO. It's like they double down on the relationship every time something bad happens. By bas I mean cops being called for broken bones, stalking, poisoning, etc. If I didn't witness it myself I would never believe someone would care about another person that could treat them that way."

However I would hope that there will always be an anti thesis to a person like that. Its seems that the 2 party system is good at creating mirror image candidates. That's all I can hope for.

politics,fe3au93,t1_fe38s7b,1578847639.0,"I wish I could believe you. This world is fundamentally different now than the one I grew up in.

Everyone used to agree on what the truth was. We disagreed on the implications of truth but there seemed to be a general acceptance of truth and falsehood. Now there are literally multiple versions of the truth among the regular populace. That is a huge fundamental difference. I grew up before the internet. The difference now is so stark it takes my breath away.

That's how we were enslaved for generations. Many people bought into the narrative that blacks were less than human and thus able to be treated accordingly.

 When looking at a candidate that is more in touch with a reality that doesn't see us sliding backwards in race relations, you're damn right I look at the ability of them to be elected over my disagreements with minor points that I have with them overall."

While they may not have deserved the beating to unconsciousness, that is the risk you take when you instigate someone by spitting on them. I always tell anyone that will listen that we all have the right to not be assaulted but that right doesn't stop someone from assaulting you, it just provides repercussions for the assailant. The fact will still remain that you were beaten senseless for being stupid. So don't be stupid and there is no reason to have this discussion."
