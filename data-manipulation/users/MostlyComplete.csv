Regardless of whether or not it’s meant to be an insult, it’s an insult. There is no context in which saying it would not be insulting/demeaning/etc towards black people, thus we censor it."
AmItheAsshole,ffsdebo,t1_ffscff0,1580179021.0,"I think that’s fair as long as you have a guest bathroom. If you only have 1 bathroom (or if the bathroom guests are going to be using is being used by a member of the household) then I think things get complicated because you can’t separate what is okay for a guest to use and what belongs to the hosts. I live in an apartment rn with one bathroom and I certainly would be upset if my guests started rummaging through my cabinets, but I can definitely see how I would not be upset by that if I had a guest bathroom and therefore my cabinets didn’t have my own personal things in them. 

But generally, in the culture I was raised in at least, I was always taught that it was impolite to do something like light a candle in someone else’s bathroom, or use someone else’s floss, or look in someone’s cabinets, especially if you’re just a dinner guest."
