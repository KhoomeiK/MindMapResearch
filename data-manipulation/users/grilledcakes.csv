AskReddit,ffhl9mj,t1_ffhjg4x,1579940580.0,The only thing that I heard dealing with first nation people's was that the area the bus was going through was full of bad spirits and could have made the killer act like a wendigo. It's was just a side type of quote and may have been made up for the story. I'm not sure.
AskReddit,ffh45ns,t3_et8871,1579922618.0,Or if they show up as an animal like a dog and you invite them into your home or camp. Plus their known to follow people fairly long distances according to the stories. The supposed home range they live in is huge. Unnerving lore.
AskReddit,ffgofml,t1_ffglgv8,1579911018.0,Ah very cool.
AskReddit,ffgiplq,t1_ffg7vrd,1579907143.0,Yep. Weird stuff happens when the meds wear off.

AskReddit,ffgh31q,t1_fffc0el,1579906081.0,I'm hoping that they do the stories justice. Check out a movie called The Void. It's not based on lovecraft but captures some of the feeling of his stories.
AskReddit,ffggx62,t1_fff6w3g,1579905977.0,There are several YouTube channels russet tell the story. A lot of the books on the subject are out of print though you can find them.
AskReddit,fff6lfa,t1_fff5bo4,1579877019.0,Nearly but that was when he was a young god. Jormagander had more than enough time to grow to its mature size and thor only gets one shot at it and it's right during the height of ragnarok as all life except for one man and one woman is destroyed and burned away forever.
AskReddit,fff69po,t1_fff3cml,1579876784.0,Gravity falls was a fantastic show. My boys and I watched the whole series and loved it all.
AskReddit,fff6606,t1_fff2nxb,1579876709.0,After the movie version of The Color Out Of Space is released Richard Stanley had already been given the go ahead to make 2 more lovecraftian films from the mythos. SperctreVision is the production company and Elijah Wood is one third of the heads of the company as well and he wants to stay as close as possible to the source material so I'm pretty excited about it.

AskReddit,fff1dgp,t1_ffexkn9,1579873008.0,"In the norse mythology. In the story of ragnarok as the worlds end, Thor will battle jormagand and he'll kill it but he'll die in the process. Read the ragnarok stories, it's heavy metal before heavy metal existed. It's definitely not a happy feel good story."
AskReddit,ffexgi3,t1_ffeukyy,1579869405.0,Yep I agree that most of the time is just not worth the effort it takes to explain. At least your mom understood and that's pretty cool. I found out in my 30s that there's a really strong chance that there were several aspies in my dad's family line.
AskReddit,ffex671,t1_ffeurnv,1579869114.0,Yeah that's the one. The tribal elders said he should be put to death but the law didn't agree. There's even a position that's feared and revered in the tribe that's supposed to track the wendigo like the bus guy down and stop them from killing even if it means killing the wendigo. I can't for the life of me remember what that position is called though.
AskReddit,ffeusys,t1_ffer4xy,1579866478.0,"You mean that book that old Abdul El'hazard done wrote? Yeah that there fella was a always going on an on bout old gods this and great mad ones that.

AskReddit,ffeufek,t1_ffetvyg,1579866006.0,Thank you for the joy and giggle the mental image of a tiny shuggoth trotting out of a house to go run an errand just brought me.
AskReddit,ffeubvn,t1_ffesarg,1579865882.0,"Yeah there are still some people who just don't grasp any explanation so I just give up sometimes. I was an adult with few very good friends before I was diagnosed so I had to learn coping mechanisms and ways to explain myself to others that didn't sound looney to them. It would have been a much different experience with other kids in school had I been diagnosed early. I got called a liar by many kids and adults when I explained things from my point of view because I had no idea my perception was different from theirs. I understand better now why they thought I was lying, but I still have a happier life than most of them at this point so I don't care what their uneducated, narrow minded views are any more."

AskReddit,ffetsfs,t1_ffereya,1579865177.0,You should read Kelley Jones's comic book called The Hammer. It's a 4 issue series from the 90s and it's brilliant. If you're into any of the great old ones mythos from lovecraft's work then The Hammer is a fun treat from the cosmic horror genre.
AskReddit,ffetiu3,t1_ffepvh8,1579864822.0,Wasn't there a report on one attacking and killing someone on a bus in northern Canada back in the early 2000s? Wendigo as in the tribal version that's a person possessed by evil spirits that eats people.
AskReddit,ffetd4a,t3_et8871,1579864606.0,The na'aglioshii aka skin walkers. If you know much about them and the areas where they roam according to the Navajo peoples then you might be as afraid of talking about them as the Navajo are. Even if you marry into the tribe they don't want to discuss that at all. Its hard for outsiders to learn about but there's just enough lore about them out there to be absolutley terrifying. There's a YouTube series that I think is by Lazy Masquerade that goes into reading anonymous reddit posts on the subject and is worth a listen.
AskReddit,fferzo6,t1_ffei48n,1579862675.0,Many aspies have various forms of synesthesia. It took me years to be able to explain it because I had to understand it from an academic point of view and had trouble understanding how most people's baseline senses work.

pics,fdrvzzm,t1_fdrlbi7,1578690587.0,I did make a very broad statement by saying most and that's based off of my own opinion of the Instagram posts I've seen. So it's really just relative to my experiences with Instagram. Also it seems the to me anyway that the ones that get the most attention are getting attention for questionable reasons instead of making people think or feel like art does. I'm not bashing all of Instagram I'm not even insulting the ones that are obviously hawking stuff for promotional money. With so many free sources to learn photography techniques it just seems like a lot of them are foregoing skill and focusing on filters and very simple photoshop. Either way it's just my opinion and opinions are not facts.
pics,fdrumcg,t1_fdrlf5k,1578690016.0,It's true that art is subjective and relative to the observer. Art has always been anything that makes you think or feel upon viewing it and that being said in my opinion and just my own I don't see any art in most of the Instagram posts I've seen.
pics,fdrkgeq,t1_fdrfgak,1578685724.0,Yeah I totally agree. The Instagram models are definitely not art. If you tried to teach them techniques and lighting I'm not sure most of them would grasp the concept but the photographer of this piece knew how to convey emotion and depth and that's what makes it art i think.
CasualConversation,fdr4pho,t3_emq85b,1578679465.0,Absolutely. The little things can snap our focus on the big things into place. The strangest detail may be the key to putting together things that didn't even seem connected and making them clear.
pics,fdr3ozc,t1_fdqrgzb,1578679088.0,Photography is definitely an art form. Even with all the technical skill a photographer has to learn they still have to have a sense of what will and what won't work for each piece.
