For background: I'm autistic, and work in hospitality, where there is this weird mix of spoken and unspoken rules: like as a waiter, you've got to know the formal rule of how to be a waiter, the sequence of service and all that shizz. But then  you've got to read people, see whether they want some time and privacy or whether they want a chat and banter. That was really hard for me to judge especially where those to groups of rule merge and mix. 

If you've not read the book, it's about this very traditional oldschool british butler in around the 1920's England . He is obsessed with the rigid formalities of his class structure, even as it's collapsing around him, and with the formalities and sense of propriety that comes with it. It's written entirely from his perspective as if it were a memoir, and thus to the reader we can strongly sympthise with his actions because we know his motivations, he comes across as cold and inhumane to many of the characters in the book.

This basically allowed me to undertand myself, and understand how I came across to others. it allowed me to let my autistic weirdnesses out (on a short leash) in public a little bit more, and made me actually enjoy my job as a waiter in a way that, I hope, makes me likeable to others. It's rare that I come across a book that mirrors my personal inner monolouge so closely, and highlights the bits about myself that are a hinderance to personal relationships."
