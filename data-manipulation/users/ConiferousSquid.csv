relationship_advice,ffeqvb5,t3_et7qbl,1579861010.0,Get out. I experienced a very similar situation with a toxic roommate and I wish I'd kicked him out before it got really bad. If he's picking fights with you when you're in pain and can't think straight he doesn't have your best interests in mind. You cannot trust him to consider you when things get rough.

socialskills,ffel6pc,t3_et6mjw,1579852714.0,"I did the same thing when I was about 19. Having never had a first kiss or lost my virginity, I sought out casual situations to get my firsts over with, thinking that if I could just get past them I would stop being anxious about it. I ended up with really underwhelming experiences and actually couldn't handle any sort of romantic/sexual interactions for about three years. I learned that it wasn't necessarily the casual nature of the encounters, but more that I was looking for anyone to get the job done instead of waiting until I met someone I connected with.

I'm much more discerning now when it comes to who I sleep with, but I went through some real rough points getting there. My best advice would be to take things slow. Make sure you like and are attracted to the person you're pursuing and not just looking for a means to an end. Even if they're not the love of your life, a nice, respectful partner makes all the difference. 

Good luck in the future!

Also, yeah, Tinder sucks."

I had no idea what the movie was about and was not prepared for what I saw, but that made it more interesting. I probably won't watch it again, though, because I'm a coward."
me_irl,ff8gfsk,t1_ff8fw6y,1579677358.0,"I am so sorry, that is the worst :( r/adhd has been a pretty good resource for me, even just to have a community of people who know what it's like. Talking to a doctor, if you can, to get a professional opinion on management techniques or medication if you need it might help as well. I hope that you're able to get the support you need to manage this!"

aww,ff8d3wy,t1_ff8c9gm,1579673539.0,"That is hilarious! I haven't, but one time my parents cat was sleeping next to me and he reached up and stretched his paw right around my eye. All I remembered was ripping his claws from my face and throwing him away from me. I was convinced it was just a vivid dream until I saw the little claw marks around my eye."
me_irl,ff88yl0,t1_ff8705w,1579669487.0,Damn that had to be rough. It's crazy how many kids fall through the cracks and we just go our whole lives thinking that we're not smart enough or not trying hard enough when we actually just have different needs than other students.
