Self-funding departments, such as Parking Services, must use its revenue generated from passes and citations to pay for its operations. At a particular threshold, they must return excess funds back to the University coffers.

Edit: besides special exceptions, financial rule 7.1.1 (Carryforward and Designated Future Commitments) states a department can only ""carryforward"" 1.5% of their budget to the next year. This also explicitly applies to CSU vet services.
