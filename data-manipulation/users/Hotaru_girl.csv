FirstTimeHomeBuyer,ff9ko9n,t3_esf4oj,1579715025.0,"The safest bet is to get a foundation expert to look at your basement and yard. This is a large crack but it hasn’t separated width wise (wider than a pencil is usually the rule, but not an exact measurement) so it may not be an immediate issue but could also indicate more movement than just house settling. The condition of the basement effects the whole house, better to address any issues there before it gets worse (and more expensive). Always get more than one opinion- quotes can vary widely!"

The oval shelving unit also competes with the vertical movement of the kitchen and makes it feel cluttered. Explore removing it or replacing with something more modular to emphasize the straight lines and vertical space. I like the black and white color scheme, however you can always break up the space by pulling in more of the gold accent to highlight the gold coloring in the lighting fixture (and warm under cabinet lighting ). 


Edit: The strongest colors in your current color palette are white, black and gold. If you keep in this realm with all your kitchen accessories it would look even more sleek. Love your kitchen and choice of light fixture, really draws the eye upward!"

milwaukee,fdhec6q,t3_eldb3w,1578420846.0,"I have stopped supporting Dollar Stores because from what I read they undercut communities [(Link)](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/19/business/dollar-general-opposition/index.html). It’s too bad they don’t put something like a mom and pop grocer or convenience store, possibly something a little better like a Trader Joe’s or Aldi (stores more affordable than metro market and keep  fresher than Cermak’s boxed goods and Target’s produce).  Terrible parking in the Third Ward for a full on grocery though. 

I was crossing my fingers that the new development in Bayview was going to host a Trader Joe’s (would be a perfect addition to the community), but it will be a food hall which is fun, but a little less practical."

Also if the client hired us directly, as a production company we required them to also hold enough liability insurance to  also cover incidents. You have crew sign waivers but from what I understand that doesn’t omit you from liability caused by negligence. However, I’m not a lawyer.  Good producers keep safety the highest priority on a production."

I have found that most of my life I have chosen to dress a certain way to avoid comments from female peers and family. It doesn’t matter though, If you’re busty you can wear a turtleneck and still get disapproving looks from other women. (Same if you’re thin, fat, short, tall, or literally anything really!)"
nextfuckinglevel,fdaup7b,t3_ekcils,1578250425.0,"The write up about the 2012 “Undercover Bar/Slim” commercial production from Egg Films: 

https://m.bizcommunity.com/PressOffice/PressRelease.aspx?i=114714&ai=75893

> Egg Film's Slim directed the first ever advert for Armstrong, a new spirit drink from Guinness Ghana.
Slim creates an undercover bar for Guinness Ghana
Conceptualised by Saatchi & Saatchi Cape Town creative director Gavin Whitfield and art director Yvonne Hall, the spot revolves around an undercover bar that converts into a business when the men's wives come to check in on them. 

>”Since the ad started flighting, people keep calling to ask who handled the post,"" laughs Egg Films' executive producer Nicci Cox. 'But we did the whole thing in camera. Everything you see move is operated by hand.""

>Nicci and Slim flew into Accra to cast the leads and research Ghanaian bars, office spaces, colours and textures, before shooting the commercial in an empty shop in Jeppestown, Johannesburg. 

>”The idea was all there,"" says Slim. ""So it was just a matter of executing it African-style, keeping it simple and not too high-tech. ""

>Art director Keenan McAdam and set builders Marcia and Raphael from Marcia's Studio spent four weeks building the revolving sets.

>”We spent a full day rehearsing, with all the sets working, so we could choreograph each shot,"" says Slim. ""During the actual shoot, we could have got it in one take - everything worked immaculately.""

>The ad's shot by Willie Nel, edited by Saki Bergh at Left, and scored by Markus Wormstorm. 

>”The shoot was a jol,"" says Slim. ""Everything ran really smoothly, apart from the craft guy who disappeared into the strip club across the road never to be seen again."" True story."
RealEstate,fcwhgcr,t3_ej77nz,1578025723.0,"Sold my grandma’s house to one of those outfits  run by a family. The foundation on the house needs repair but the house is huge (5 bed 2 bath) for the area. They will make good money on it and it saves us the time of cleaning or repairing while grandma is settled somewhere else and getting medical treatments. They offered more than they needed in money down and we talked them up a bit since there’s new windows, siding and roof. Been painless so far.

Edit: Grandma wanted to sell it ASAP, we negotiated a higher price than they originally offered based on the comps in the area. It was a fair deal and she was sick of paying those utility bills, she no longer needs the house (it’s in a bit of a rougher area) and it just seems empty to her after grandpa died. She is also a hoarder so they will throw away the stuff we couldn’t handle."

We had serial stompers that would literally shake the walls, while that was annoying, it was understandable (we ended up leaving because the apartment was just that badly built). What was not understandable was them running from the apartment all the way down the stairs at 4AM, dropping dumbbells and blasting music in the morning. You have to choose your battles, and if you are too picky you may get a neighbor who is just says screw it and doesn’t even try. I’ve been there, it’s hard, but it could just as easily be us living our lives on the upper floor, unaware of how much we’re pissing our lower neighbor off."
