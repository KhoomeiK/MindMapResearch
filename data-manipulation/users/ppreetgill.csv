EDIT: Since we’re talking about a teen here, infertility, chronic low testosterone and supressed HPA axis would be my main concerns"
Testosterone,ff7jtdi,t1_ff7im5r,1579651229.0,"I can’t see the method of their experiment here. Could you possible link me the full text of this study?
EDIT: there seems to be a high level of confounding and selection bias here, therefore you cannot say they absolutely cause low testosterone. Also, I found the study design of most studies, they all have very small sample sizes, studies done on maybe 7-8 men at most at once. Not very convincing."
Testosterone,ff794na,t1_ff76o0g,1579643625.0,"Appearance of gynecomastia may still be non pathological even at 18. It may take upto 2 years to regress, I’d suggest waiting as well, cause surgery can always be done but don’t start drug therapy, the side effects may be permanent, one if the main ones being infertility. And SSRI’s themselves don’t cause low T’s but assuming you took them for depression, depression increases cortisol which has a prolonged effect on decreasing testosterone activity via SHBG, some theories suggest low T itself may cause depression. How does your diet, workout schedule, sleeping cycle and social life look like?"
Testosterone,ff71dn0,t3_es0fc8,1579639186.0,"Gynecomastia is normal in teenage boys. It’ll go away by 21-22 years of age. However you T is definitely not optimum for your age. Experimenting with T at your age comes at a huge risk, what do your habits/diets/stress etc look like?"

AskMen,feqnsf3,t3_eqcr8y,1579344077.0,"Don’t reprogram it. Use this anger and self hate as a motivation to achieve. I’m used to this circle of self deprivation-motivation-achievement-complacency-self hate for complacency-self deprivation. Keep breaking your own barriers. Enjoy it. You are gifted to have this feeling if you can muster the motivation. Most people don’t have a pot to piss in yet think of themselves as a demi god or something, the majority."

getdisciplined,fcy4p6c,t1_fcxpjwl,1578074735.0,"Coffee is a tool, it’s efficiency depends on the way you use it , I’m a student of medicine, I have more practical experience chugging down coffee to write exams than you, I’m sure. Let’s leave my theoretical knowledge out of it. The effects of coffee don’t depend on what you subjectively ‘assign’ it.

There are two ways to use coffee, optimal or suboptimal. What you just suggested is on the lower end of suboptimal, and surely harmful on the long run. Cheers. 

Again, re read my original post, why you need a ‘kick’ to start a day. Stop being self conceited."
getdisciplined,fcxoj6d,t3_ejd57p,1578067806.0,"Fuck this is stupid, don’t get addicted to working 
/studying on coffee, only use it close to exams when you need to stretch your limits for those few extra chapters or else it loses effect if you do it everyday(initially you drink it to feel mentally sharp, later with increased tolerance you need it just to wake up/fee normal)
For those who say I can’t do it without coffee, quit coffee when you don’t have to study for at least 15 days, you’ll go through withdrawals and won’t need it anymore. 
Keep it for those important tests."
