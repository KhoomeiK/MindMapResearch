timberwolves,fff84r8,t1_fff7tmx,1579878094.0,"I’d watch fox sports go even if they starting spamming trump ads (god forbid), such is my love for jimpete and Marney gellner. 

Also idk how the t wolves public feels about Annie sabo she’s new but I like her too.

Tom hanneman can just retire tho god damn"
timberwolves,fff6ta1,t1_fff6k1r,1579877177.0,"Eh I don’t think so but yeah fox sports go definitely repeats the same ads more than any other streaming things I’ve seen. I watch all my TV online (fox sports go for wolves, watch espn for other shit, or just watchxfinity thing and plug my computer into the TV).

All ads suck but there’s definitely some weirdness on online stream ones people are right, like some ads cannot be skipped or reload and play twice in a row and stuff it is weird for sure.

Disclaimer I kinda like the fox sports go ads because I don’t live in the state anymore and many of them are Minnesota/local businesses so it makes me feel a little closer to home lol."

If he said “he’s closer to his 24th BIRTHDAY than his 23rd birthday. Then he’d be right. But no how old you are isn’t a fraction, you ARE 23 or you ARE 24. Lol"
