madlads,fejtv63,t3_epd745,1579185726.0,So people STILL think the Bee Movie thing is funny? You'd think madlads would at least pick a different movie script or something. But this is so old and stale.
madlads,fejth4h,t1_fejlb3d,1579185453.0,I upvoted you because screw you downvote farmer
Austin,fehzdt2,t1_feftvr9,1579126957.0,"Oh for sure it's much better than being in a car in that area. I didn't mean to give the impression that the traffic is great but the trains suck. I too would welcome half the service of WMATA, but I'd definitely hope we could do better. I'd prefer not to have our transit system gain a reputation for being on fire."
Austin,fefp2jj,t3_eorbhk,1579061271.0,"I haven't really traveled much in my life, but I've spent a couple of months every year the past few years working in DC. While up there I'm not given a rental car, but they pay for my Metro card. 

I realize DC is a completely different city, but I would enjoy an Austin with subways that hit the important stops. Austin is more spread out than DC, but I love that so many important spots have very close, convenient access to the Metro. Like anywhere I wanted to go in DC was like 1/2 mile at most from any stop. 

I think putting a whole system that doesn't require the roads to use would be great, especially through downtown area. 

And I'm a native Austinite, and yeah I hate that everyone came and flooded into the area and everything's going away and luxury apartments and rent sucks and holy crap. Yeah. I get it. But I can get behind stuff like this because there's just no reason to sit around and say, ""oh well, it's too late, don't expand, let Austin die."" 

I dunno. I like the subway idea. I'd ride it if it were good. DC/WMATA is awful. Pathetic. I'd hope we could do better. I mean from a planning, executing, customer service point of view... Like it's just run by idiots. The system could be good and it used to be, apparently, but it's just bad now."
WhitePeopleTwitter,feea7d0,t3_eok9lb,1579029584.0,I need to get off the internet for a while... I was getting frustrated cuz I couldn't figure out what GYM was initials for... I assumed it was like lol or brb or something
Austin,fedrz3d,t1_fedjf8l,1579018620.0,"Ah ok, my bad. I tried searching but I couldn't find anything, maybe it's just that I suck at Reddit. 

Thanks, anyway, sorry everyone!"

instantkarma,fdt6cuw,t1_fdsrvrj,1578712497.0,She kicked my dog and now I'm going to fuck her
nsfwasmr,fdpjuhf,t1_fdktmsn,1578630596.0,"I never had a boner in the first place with this vid, she's too cutesy and even when she spends liked 10 seconds saying anything close to ""erotic,"" she just sounds uncomfortable saying it. Like she dances around the subject. ""I'll repay you in another way,"" or whatever and in the black dress one it's like she kept saying, ""my chest area,"" and it's like damn you can't even say, ""breast?"" Like I wouldn't expect her to get all super into saying she's gonna massage her own tittyballs or suck Achmed's dick (holy fuck that name... Like on its own it's fine, I don't hate the name, but it's definitely weird to see this pure little white girl say she's in love with Achmed.) But damn can you at least act like you're a grown up? 

And I'm a HUGE JBN fan. I think she's so cute and sweet, and I wish her the best, and I actually kinda feel bad watching these leaks but damn I dunno. Just some thoughts."

I might donate just to get a chance at trying it without waiting in line.

And because it's a good thing to do... Yeah"

It's one thing if you just lost him or he was just diagnosed with something, yes, that's heartbreaking. But he's perfectly fine, and you're not just thinking about how old he's getting and that he might pass away soon, but you're saying it in your title? I'm saying it's tacky. Especially when some of us actually did lose our dog early to sudden diseases, and didn't have the luxury of them living out their entire lives."
