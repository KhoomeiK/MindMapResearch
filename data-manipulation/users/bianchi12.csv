JoeRogan,fh7tfuc,t3_f1d9wa,1581344249.0,Next week we’ll find out Jocko Wilink is addicted to adderall.   100mg at 4am - take a picture of watch at 4:32.  Another 100mg at 9am and typy typy type type.
JoeRogan,fh7sdo4,t1_fh6umcj,1581343409.0,Yeah - the coma makes the pt unconscious during the uncomfortable part of withdrawal.  As he would be intubated and have several IV access points the seizures are not a worry as you can treat them with anticonvulsants quickly.  If he was laying in a bed for more than a week he would not be walking well - this happens to most people and doesn’t mean he had a stroke or is experiencing a conversion disorder rn.

SandersForPresident,fgtgofn,t1_fgrqsbn,1581104210.0,"Like abortion? Thats been a topic for 50 years and nothing changed.  Taxing the rich? The rich run the senate and house - they will tax the middle class if anything.  How about immigration?  There are thousands of miles of land to cross the border which we cant stop.  Cut student loans?  Oh yah trillions of dollars will be lost cancelling those loans, but how about the 14 year old - will their loans be cancelled too in 10 years?  Green energy?  Yah this is fair - a green new deal actually would work and I am not skeptical of this policy.  Education though? Who the fuck is going to pump a trillion dollars into k-12 while we have the above issues - they are just poor kids after all who cant vote.  Health care?  A quarter of our economy is based on health care - you think anyone would vote to socialize that machine?  The system sucks but it allows money to flush through the economy with a lot of people getting screwed as a result, but overall a lot of people having good careers with the current setup.  Foreign wars?  Create another power vacuum and if a terrorist attack occurs have your presidency defined by being the president who couldnt defend their country?

Policy is the last thing to worry about.  Nothing of significance changes - nothing that effects me as a normal upper middle class person.  I just want a president who can represent us to other countries, think with a level head, and inspire the country.  The only person I have seen who comes close to this is Tusli, so not a lot of reason to be optimistic unless Bernie croaks once in office (because he and trump are too old to be the president)."

HumansAreMetal,fgp8q1p,t1_fgok5zo,1580999587.0,"Lets say he ‘had’ bipolar, and he was manic and that this is not just fake news.  Then yes, he could have easily stayed awake that long.  I have seen it a few times.  Unfortunately, he would be delirious and maybe showing psychotic features after about 3-4 days of no sleep, and no one would let him ‘doctor’ them.  People get real ugly after the third night without sleep.  

Otherwise, no doctor I know has stayed up for more than 3 straight days (0 sleep over 2 night span + working all the next day). The person I mention was a transplant surgeon, and he said he needed a cab home after that shit show of bad circumstances (working this much is blatantly against policy but I guess there wasn’t really a choice).  Sadly, a resident had died a few years back in a car crash after similar circumstances.  

Anyway, fake news, but still entertained me for about 10 minutes so I’ll just call it FOX NEWS."
