todayilearned,ffm4749,t3_eu4zeu,1580048140.0,"So, what does that job pay? I guess you have to hang around with the President all the time - heck yeah, what's for lunch? (I don't care which President - I'm just thinking that eating must be pretty good hanging around the big boys.)

Do I have to wear a tie?"
AskReddit,ffm3ogj,t1_ffm3gwm,1580047974.0,I like that response - now I've got to make up pocket cards and remember which pocket I put them in so I can really shock and awe!
politics,ffhza1m,t1_fffx4zy,1579960116.0,"Thank you. I don't relish oversight and tariffs certainly fall into that arena. Perhaps we all need to step back and think of the global good - but who gets to establish the baseline for measurement of wealth and growth. Sadly, me being able to buy a car is tough to compare to purchasing a wheeled cart in India. Again, that quickly becomes the labor cost/outsource problem which ends up being regulated by tariff which we'd hope was figured out by someone smarter than us (joke).

Bailouts - Farmers have been subsidized and paid to NOT grow crops for decades and decades. Primarily to prevent a glut of one or another crop. Strange concept. Bailouts of banks, auto companies and others directly affected millions of people. I don't like the fact that I could screw up by putting my house in the wrong place (flood), overextending myself via mortgage I never fully understood, or other calamity and then have the Fed come in to rebuild my life - it just doesn't seem fair on a one-to-one situation (why should you have to pay for me being greedy in the past and overextending on a loan so I can have a three-car garage in my new home as an example). 
However... failure of those banks and collapse of those loans, auto manufacturers and farmers would affect millions of people which may have resulted in a new depression and, invariably, the Fed would have had to pay for anyway - so, maybe stepping in a bailing out was the right thing to do.

Tough call, I was never raised to believe in a ""free lunch."" I have very little financial sympathy for folks that lose their house located in a historical flood zone, tornado alley, hurricane pathway or side of an active volcano. Their choice to build was a gamble - same as betting you can pay your mortgage - and sometimes you lose the bet.

Perhaps I'm just thinking out loud as I write - should those that failed be saved? If so, how and when seems to be the question.

Perhaps we should be teaching people basic skills - build a fire, skin a squirrel, clear and plant a field, read a contract, create a budget, do your taxes..."
politics,fffvkpu,t1_fffot33,1579892747.0,"I'm for a free market society. I'm also for a person taking responsibility for themselves to achieve and survive.
I am not a socialist that naively thinks the rich should be persecuted for taking chances, having opportunity or just blind luck.
I am also for fairness in business. My boss retired with over 400 million - I worked for years, I earned money, I received stock and I retired well and live comfortably. I would never think to take away the money he retired with as that wasn't the employment ""contract"" that I signed up for.
Its the same for tuition ""forgiveness"" - give me a break. Someone takes out a loan and then renigs on the deal by not paying back - how is that fair to the folks that will have to pay (you and me via taxes). I'd be glad to help support free education - but that NOT the deal the people agreed to.

Since when do people NOT have to honor their agreements - whether for loans or for employment.

Free market society works for labor as well as goods. If there is excess labor, the price is low. If there is scarce skilled/technical/manual labor force than prices go up.

Seldom does management sit around and say ""how can we screw the little guy."" They do ask what the going rate of pay is for a position and then use that to determine pricing and feasibility for a product. Then, they fill the jobs from the pool of WILLING candidates and make the product.

worldnews,ff69hxd,t1_ff42e9t,1579622273.0,"Having billionaires is NOT a problem. Wallowing in envy about how poor you may be in relation to others IS the problem.

There will always be people with more or less than any of us. Someone has success with a garden, others have a fancy car, the lady with the excellent boots, the neighbor's grass is greener, my kid is cuter/smarter...

Working better/harder/smarter and trying to provide for yourself and family is the clearest way to elevate your value to your sphere. And, by providing true value to others the outcome is very often recognition and reward/promotion, etc.

At the same time, working hard and achieving even modest success can distract a person from focusing on what they ""have not"" since their own self-worth has increased.

The fallacy is not having respect for your own abilities and believing you can never achieve anything, therefore you believe that others should be brought down to your level so that you can feel good. However, if that were to occur, you'd still be the same person and feel the same way about looks, toys, living space, living location - you name it and humans will be jealous of it and want to take it away."
