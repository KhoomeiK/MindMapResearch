tequila,fffamav,t1_ff88vb5,1579879743.0,"> I hate whiskey because it tastes like shitty tequila
Exactamente

>Don Julio 70
It's upper tier good, but not all that. Seemed more like a marketing gimmick where they just put the 70 label on the regular Blanco.

> Maestro Dobel
I think you and I have very similar palates, friend. This was the tequila that turned everything around for me.

To the OP, the first thing to do is isolate if it's the process, then where in the process.

For example, I discovered that I hate aÃ±ejos. And reposados. Only silvers/blancos for me. Guess I like em young ðŸ˜Ž"

bigdickproblems,fdnxbrg,t1_fdknk81,1578594743.0,"Reconceptualize a bell curve as the 80/20 rule. This generally states that the bulk of the distribution is the 80 and the margins as the 20.
Now, go back and look at the bell curve and split it into two halves, left and right. This would mean that there is an extreme of 10 on each side, those are the very small and the very large. But in between those two extremes lie *most* of the population. So saying ""average and below"" is describing everything about the bell curve _except_ the bigs, the 10 on just one side of the curve.
Does that help?"
