AskReddit,ff672qb,t1_ff64fan,1579620682.0,"My plan for the Air Force was only to stay in one term of service unless I just absolutely loved the job. I'll be getting out soon now and have accomplished all of my initial goals and am working on some stretch goals for myself. My plan was to get SSgt before I got out, save over $150,000, get a good chunk of college completed, get my retirement fund back where it should be (separate from my other savings goal), and gain useful skills. The job I got was in line with what I want to do (technology related). While not everything went like I planned, it has overall been a positive experience, even though the structure and lack of freedom isn't for me.

Since you sound like you want to promote fast or possibly commission, here's a little advice. You'll learn about Epr's, which are annual performance reviews where you put all the amazing things you did throughout the year. Early on, any kind of leadership bullet (bullets are just lines on the epr) looks really good, because it's seen as operating at a higher rank than you are currently at. So in tech school, organize and run a volunteer event, study group, etc.

Also, your career is up to you. If you want to get a nice special assignment, you have to go for it. It rarely comes to you. Start volunteering for exercises and things around the squadron after tech school so your name is out there. That way, if a short notice TDY comes up, your leadership will need names for it and you'll be one of the first they think of.

Lastly, don't be afraid to ask the more experienced people questions. You'll learn quick that rank isn't usually something to be feared or nervous about. Good SSgt's and up will want to mentor and help you achieve your goals. Keep in mind, not everyone is a good supervisor. Sometimes you get shit luck with a bad supervisor, but that's why you need to take your career into your own hands. If you have a good supervisor though, be sure to learn from them."
AskReddit,ff60fjm,t1_ff5vnub,1579615917.0,"It's never too late to have a fresh start. I did similar to the other commenter and joined the Air Force to get back on my feet. (My situation was a little different as I didn't feel I needed the structure so much as the financial/college benefits).

If I can offer some advice, over the next couple weeks come up with a plan for the next 10 years. It sounds like a lot, but hear me out. Ask yourself some questions: What would you want to do/be if money was no object? Where do you think you realistically could be in 10 years? Is there something related to your first answer that's a bit more attainable? Keep in mind, this isn't set in stone, but it will help give you a solid direction to go.

Whatever you decide, most things you'd want to do will require or be helped by having a strong financial base and getting educated. Now that you have an end goal in mind, look at the steps needed to get there. Quantify what you need to attain the goal. If you want to travel a lot, you might decide you need to be financially independent and have a flexible schedule job. Create savings goals (save $100,000 in 5 years for example) and learn to invest so your money works for you.

Now, after all that, if you decide you need to join the air Force, all this goal setting will be a great asset for several reasons. One, you'll be able to walk into the recruiters office with an idea of what job you want already, which will make it harder for them to talk you into something you don't want (it's your career, not theirs. Be persistent). Second, you'll have an idea of how long you want to stay in. Since you're joining later in life, 20 years may not be feasible, but 4-10 years might be enough for your goals. Lastly, you'll be saving a ton of money. A lot of people get all the disposable income when they get in and spend it on stupid stuff. You don't have to be Scrooge McDuck and not buy anything, but since you have a goal, you'll find it much easier to stay on track with saving/investing. You'll also be able to help mentor the younger people around you.

So, TLDR, whether you join or not, come up with a goal/purpose in life and make concrete steps to achieve it. It helped me immensely. Good luck.

egg_irl,fet58wl,t1_feruqi3,1579371923.0,"I'm not gonna say I understand exactly what you're going through, but maybe a little. My parents are fundamentalist Christian too and greatly dislike LGBT anything. If I came out to them, they wouldn't hate me, but would think I'm diseased and try to ""pray the gay away"". Sounds like your parents would be more hateful though.

As far as therapy/support groups go, I only have my therapist as a reference. She wouldn't judge you for feeling the way you do and would genuinely help. She's trained to deal with those kinds of issues. There are also forms you sign ahead of time that clearly lay out privacy and what things she has to report and to whom.

I guess a support group would be difficult for a misanthropic individual, but I still think it could be good if you went with an open mind and tempered expectations. The benefit is that you could explain it away as going to hang out with friends or some school activity, so your parents wouldn't find out.

As for the fetish part, I have the same question about myself. The answer I've come up with for me currently is ""so what?"". It's not wrong to like to dress or feel like a woman. Gender is a gradient anyways, so it's not just trans or cis. Maybe I'm trans, maybe not, but I know I like being feminine, so that's good enough for now.

I'm not a psychologist by any stretch (I'm still figuring all this out same as you), just thought I'd brainstorm with you to come up with some ideas that might help. If you want to talk, or if you're ever in the Nebraska area and need some help, let me know."
egg_irl,fertnjm,t1_ferg26c,1579358257.0,"I can't imagine the stress that'd come from living with my parents while wanting to transition. I know it's hard, but we're rooting for you. If you don't yet, one thing that helped me with the financial aspects of moving out was to make a 5 year plan and think about how I'd earn money/set savings goals to meet along the way. Break up the task into smaller goals (the feeling of progress helped a lot for me).

Keep your eyes out for anyone that would be supportive or neutral to your transition and needs a roommate. Maybe try going to a support group if you can, not just for support, but it'd be a good way to meet friends who understand what you're going through.

Depending on how anti-lgbt your parents are (I'm assuming they are), you might can wear girls clothes that are still androgynous without any problem. You can shave your body hair easily and just where pants so no one notices. Cute socks are also easy to hide. If you do your own laundry, you might even get some women's underwear, but that'd be greater risk of your parents finding out. Amazon is decent for buying clothes on the down-low, but it's expensive. If you have a supportive friend, a better option is to ask them to go thrift store shopping with you. It's so much fun and cheap.

Lastly, I know you know this deep down, but you aren't human scum and you deserve to be comfortable with yourself."

Also, I don't know how in depth your project is supposed to be, but for surveys, it's a good idea to consider your overall goal for the information. Currently, the questions all loosely revolve around video games, but seem kinda random.

""Option 3"" could be ""space"". You could include more recent games for your list question. Games that are either scifi, shooters, or both would be a good fit (Star Wars: Jedi Knight or Dark Forces might be good options). Finally, your question about what viewing angle I prefer was a bit redundant with the question about first or third person.
