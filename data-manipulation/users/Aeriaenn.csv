books,ff5ksff,t1_ff4x2dk,1579597653.0,"Thanks for the reply, I was reacting precisely to what he said in his comment. I read the books as a teen and really enjoyed them, and while I might not be religious anymore I still think they were a good read.    

I wouldn't want to reread them now because I feel like I would enjoy them less and make myself remember them less fondly. At the time the message resonated with me way stronger being forced to go to church with my family ever could. 

With that being said, I realised that Susan became vain. I still remember a passage, I think that was Lucy talking, that Susan became obsessed with growing up. That when she turned a young adult she tried to do everything she could to stay that age, partying, giving thought to only superficial things like makeup and trying to forget Narnia and flat out trying to deny they ever visited it.   

This kinda baffled me as a kid, as I remembered she spent a lifetime in Narnia in the first book, so why would she forget it after a few years? (And why'd she act like a stupid teenager when she should have the experience of having gone through those years once?) What went over my head though, was that it was a symbolism of her losing her faith."
