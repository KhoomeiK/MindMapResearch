Andrzej Sapkowski: - ""I can't say much about the game as such, because I don't know it, I don't play games. Publicity and sales results speak for themselves, it would be a weak game, it would not have such achievements. But working on my own success, unfortunately, playing my books hurt. Several publishers have placed game graphics on the covers of my books. So many readers qualified books as so-called game related, i.e. written for the game. There are many such books on the SF&F market. Seeing the picture of the game on the cover of my book, many fans assumed that this game was the first. And serious SF and fantasy fans despise such secondary books and don't buy them, because -  primo -  they are secondary and not original. Secundo  - they are completely irrelevant to those who do not play any games - and such is the vast majority among fans.""

“The belief, widely spread by CDPR, that the games made me popular outside of Poland is completely false,” Sapkowski told Waypoint of The Witcher series.

“I made the games popular. All of my translations in the West – including the English one – were published before the first game.”

As the article points out - ""This is just – factually incorrect? The Witcher released globally on PC in October 2006. The first Witcher book released in English was The Last Wish, which arrived in 2007, and the first novel, Blood of Elves, wasn’t published in English until 2008.""

There's numerous ways that could be abused by cops (of course, they never abuse power or get into people's stuff without proper warrant/permission - /s). While Cellebrite can claim that its device wouldn't give out the contents of text messages, emails, or phone calls, anyone in technology can tell you that these kind of programs tend to collect more metadata then people expect, and that data WILL get used against the people who it belonged to. 

Then we get into what kind of use would trigger the device. Cellebrite says it wouldn't trigger when people are using hands free modes, but until I see a dedicated team of theirs whose only job is to stay up to date with new software for every model of phone available - and that software comes out daily - AND keep all the police departments who have these devices updated with a white list, then I can't see this as being viable. The false positive rate would be too high, which would then be abused in the same way so many other things about traffic citations are - either people wouldn't know how to challenge it, or worse, the courts would just accept the police testimony without taking challenges to the software.

boardgames,ffcyep6,t3_esxbps,1579809840.0,"As you said, it is likely a combination of reasons. 

I do think games are becoming better. Both because of increased access to games, but also due to communication. The advent of the internet made it possible for people to learn about new mechanics from games that might not have ever made it to their country. 

Then combine that with the ability for people to communicate freely with others and share ideas on what mechanics, themes, etc. seem to work well and which don't...well, that's a recipe for increased opportunity for innovation. Which then goes back into the cycle of ""play, communicate, refine, repeat"".

Our second and third games of Trickerion. [First game last week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/eelzdo/what_did_you_play_this_week_dec_16_dec_22/fbvk1g1/)

It feels like we learned a lot from the first game. Scores went up between 20-60 points per person between the first and second game. There were a lot more focused actions - people were using the market more often, Dark Alley was a little more popular, etc. 

At the same time, we were trying to learn the Inventions - our first game had only had Dark Alley/Academy, so the Inventions and signature tricks were new. The easier ones - Mechanical Tesla Coils and Escapist Escape Machine - got a lot of value. 

The third game took us down to three players, and might've been a mistake to play immediately after - we weren't thinking as clearly after already playing one game of Trickerion. That being said, we had a highly competitive game, with two people nearly breaking 200pts (195/196). For comparison, our first game had a high or 140, and second had a high of 178. 

I got to use the Hypotizer for the third game, and that thing is amazing with the right stuff. I managed to snag the protege power that gives +1 action at Dark Alley, and draw 3 cards, pick 1. Every turn I was picking up 3 or 4 DA cards, then using the Hypotizer to swap them in as needed. Very very strong. 

I feel like Trickerion plays better at 4 people, but 3 is still enjoyable. 

However, two games in a row is a bit much for all of us, and way too much for some of us. Doubt we'll play more then one game a night of Trickerion, and any other game would have to be very light afterwards."
