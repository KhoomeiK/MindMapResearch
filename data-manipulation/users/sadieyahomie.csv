The ex shouldn't even matter to her anymore, and if the ex's presence is bothering you, she should have already blocked his number or something. Major red flag, OP. Run before you let yourself live in this situation further."

offmychest,ffeiz4b,t1_ffeijb6,1579849938.0,"Thank you so much for this. You're right that I should ask them. I haven't asked them yet, because I'm scared that maybe they'll just push me to go with my parents this weekend. The 3 of them already have their own families, so it's like they're also depending on me to handle our parents as the ""baby"" of the family. :( I'll try asking them today, hopefully they understand my situation huhu"
relationship_advice,ffeiqw4,t1_ffei5fa,1579849666.0,"Thank you so much for this, I needed this. :( I love them to death, and they're the main reason why I even chose to stay homebased- so I can take care of them especially since they're getting old. It hurts to know that maybe I've also hurt them, but it's just feels unfair to be sermoned or guilt-tripped for choosing to spend weekends with other people.. on weekdays I hardly even get to talk with friends through chat, only my boyfriend. :( Thank you so much for this, I really appreciate it."
relationship_advice,ffei1oy,t1_ffehmlb,1579848841.0,"Thank you so much for this, I love your advice and ideas! The main problem with me going by myself to the provincial house to do these is that I can't. :( The place isn't easily accessible at the moment, and I don't drive yet. And when we go there, they usually aren't game to explore surroundings because they just want to stay in the house and garden plants and sleep (they're around 65-70 years old btw). But I do get your message, and I guess I should think of ways to make it up to them. :("
offmychest,ff4ma51,t1_ff4le5m,1579567046.0,"I totally agree with you! Hopefully she still enjoys and feels her age, I imagine it would be exhausting in her shoes if she doesn't enjoy the persona she's putting up at all."
socialskills,fepa4k6,t3_eq4cqc,1579315562.0,"The ""act like they don't affect you"" usually works for verbal bullying. But not for physical bullying. If they ever lay a hand on you, your mom should have taught you to know when to fight back and not.

My best advice for someone being bullied is to simply walk away without a word. I did this before. Super effective. The bullies eventually grew tired of preying on me."

I'm curious though... how do we set the boundary between being an actual jerk who's really uninterested in having a conversation with people, and being someone who's just having trouble socializing?
Genuinely curious."

relationship_advice,fdpx8xh,t3_emkm7y,1578644357.0,"Aside from how unhygienic this practice is, I'm also concerned of his principles and beliefs. I mean.. imagine if you have a son with him. Imagine what principles he would pass on to your son. This may lead to discriminating the lgbt, like.. ""You touch your dick? Hella gay, man"" or something like that. The principle is just borderline weird and may result to conflicts in the future.

Maybe straighten this out with him? This is also to make sure if your beliefs are aligned, cause if it doesn't, it will lead to future conflicts.

And please please please... don't have sex with him unless you're sure that he washes his thing.. with hands. I'm not a guy, but I believe things are always better washed/ cleaned when you use your hands, and not just water pressure. :(("
TrueOffMyChest,fdfoukj,t3_ekv6dq,1578366670.0,"I agree 100% to this. While I'm from an asian country, I can say it's the same here where most internships are free. 

It IS cruel, and to think you have to spend more or less a whole semester working for them, which is literally what you call ""labor"" without getting paid, is pretty much like getting a massage everyday for free and reasoning to the masseus that it's just practice.

Tbh I'm okay with them requiring internships, because on my end, I've learned a lot and it made me equipped for the actual working life. But these companies could have atleast provided for transportation, food, and overtime... because we're basically spending more by working for them. Heck, we're pretty much spending more already just by commuting to the office. I know getting interns is basically their way for saving money, and that students still go for them in spite of how unenthical the practice is, but man do I hope these companies who offer unpaid internships get sued someday."

offmychest,fdcpusb,t1_fdcowx3,1578281035.0,"Oh I'm not in the US hehe thanks for this though! In my case, since the company I'm in is overseas and doesn't have a physical office here, I can't apply to pay for taxes either since I have to provide their registration certificates, etc (that should be local). :)"
jobs,fcx3wtn,t3_ej38g0,1578050125.0,"Omg THANK YOU for speaking up about this, because I'm in the same boat as you are, and I'm also WFH!!

I remember the times when my mom would catch me working till 1am, and it would make her furious cause she knew how tired I was. I also had a friend whose plans I always bailed out on due to work/ finishing deadlines (that were unreasonably impossible) and when I explained how I try to finish work so that my load will be less tomorrow, she said ""If you force to finish your work today, they'll only be piling more of your tasks tomorrow"" and it hit me hard.

Now, I've been punching out of work a few minutes after my work hours and I've never been happier as I'm finally feeling the work-life balance. Basically my mindset has become: ""If I couldn't get the job done by today, I apologize, but I really did my best and it was just not feasible given the workload. I have to go now though, because I still have errands to do."" 

Plus, working from home is such a privilege if we practice these, since we get to spend more time with our families once we log off from work."
relationship_advice,fcwwuu2,t3_ej3aq7,1578041035.0,">She basically told me that her money is hers alone to use, and I, being the guy, am supposed to pay for everything related to the family, including her allowance and expenses. Her argument is that her mum told her that a guy can easily cheat on the girl, leaving the girl with nothing, so she has to have her savings as a backup plan. She also told me giving birth is a big enough sacrifice, so I should be the one supporting the child.

No offense, but... this reasoning sounds reaaally sexist and delusional to me (being in the year 2020s and all).

Personally, I'd take this as a red flag. She can still have her savings apart from her supposed contribution to your house finances in the future. I'd understand if you have a baby and she would have to quit her job to raise them. But basing from your story, her mindset/ expectation is extremely unfair on your part."
