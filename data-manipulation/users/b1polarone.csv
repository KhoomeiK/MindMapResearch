I’m also taking melatonin (10mg), and magnesium before bed. I can usually fall asleep without issues but find myself waking up after a few hours and tossing and turning for awhile.

Maybe Trazodone could help you with sleep and possibly even the depression (that’s what I’m hoping for), my doctor said it’s safer than an SSRI/SNRI for those with bipolar disorder. My hypomania felt amazing, minus buying things I didn’t really need and that are now collecting dust, felt like I was finally happy with my life and was hopeful for the future, but when I went full blown manic things got pretty ridiculous and I ended up in the hospital. :/"

I’m currently on 10mg, it helps me get to sleep but I’m really struggling to stay asleep throughout the night, I’ve also been feeling very restless the past few months, unsure if it’s the Saphris causing these issues all of a sudden or if it’s just my anxiety and depression, it’s so hard not knowing.

I guess I’ll try to stick it out with the Saphris for the time being until I can speak with the psychiatrist about it, definitely worried about causing more issues with my sleep, but would be nice to get away from having to taste this every night.

I’m actually trying Lamictal currently along with Saphris, just got up to 100mg today, really hoping it can help me with this depression but haven’t felt any benefits yet, how has it been for you?"

I was supposed to see my psychiatrist tomorrow but he had to go out of the country for a month which is a pain. He had me on some antidepressants early on after my manic episode but they didn’t seem to help at all unfortunately, and now he thinks we should avoid them in case they cause another episode, but I may ask him if there’s something else we could try because I’m barely functioning with this depression. :("
BipolarReddit,ff4iako,t1_ff4dogg,1579564281.0,"Thank you very much for the detailed response!

I do struggle with bad restlessness during the day and sometimes find myself pacing around, but don’t seem to have a problem during the night after taking the saphris other than waking up often (even 50mg of trazadone hasn’t been helping me sleep through the night) so I’m not sure if it’s akathisia I’m experiencing or just bad anxiety making me restless. I do have leftover cogentin though, I wonder if I should try it again to see if it helps at all.

I’m currently taking lamotrigine along with the saphris hoping it can help with my depression, but I hear that’s not the best at preventing manic episodes. If I do decide to come off the saphris it’s good to know I could use the 2.5mg wafers to taper off!"

So I’m stuck not knowing if it was a one time drug-induced mania or if it was actually caused by the illness.

Since coming down from the manic episode I have been dealing with horrible depression like I’ve never felt before, along with really bad anxiety.

I’m sure it would help a lot with my sleep and anxiety but I quit in July after psychiatrists scared me into believing that it helped bring on my first manic episode, so I’m afraid to go back to it. :(

Thank you so much, you as well!"
bipolar,fcl6o83,t1_fcl4k1j,1577740965.0,"Thank you so much, I really hope so! Are you still taking Zyprexa or did they pull you off after your hypomania subsided? I’m still on an antipsychotic (Saphris) along with Lamotrigine and worry it’s holding me back mood wise, and also causing insomnia issues so I may speak with psychiatrist about tapering off it."
bipolar,fcl5t66,t3_ehq0r1,1577740435.0,"I’ve been in a depressive episode for about 6 months and have been really struggling, I wake up often throughout the night and have a lot of trouble falling back to sleep, it’s been tough. Are you sleeping at all? I can imagine severe lack of sleep really taking a toll on your mind."
bipolar,fcl0v91,t1_fciv5xo,1577737379.0,How long have you been on the Lamictal? Has it not been able to help you at all with your depressive episode? I recently started on it in hopes it can help with mine!
bipolar,fcl0413,t1_fckz24t,1577736911.0,Gotcha. I’m glad it’s been helping you! I’m hoping it can help pull me out of this depressive episode I’ve been in for months. Did it help you with any depression/anxiety issues?
bipolar,fckwl3m,t1_fckv5x1,1577734751.0,"I just switched to mornings since I was worried it was causing issues with my sleep, although I was already having some insomnia issues prior to starting it. :/ Also I thought I may feel more benefits throughout the day if I take it when I get up. You could always try evenings if the shakes are really bad, do you drink coffee after taking it by chance?"
bipolar,fckh911,t1_fcjuryt,1577725286.0,Best of luck to you! Are you taking it in the morning or evening?
bipolar,fckh3pg,t1_fcjfih0,1577725193.0,"Okay thanks! What dosage are you at now? Also, do you take it in the morning or evening?"
bipolar,fcigziz,t1_fcigfx7,1577662390.0,"Gotcha, thanks for the response!"
bipolar,fcigc2m,t3_ehd9la,1577662108.0,That’s awesome! I’m heading into week 3 myself but haven’t noticed any change yet. Going to try taking it in when I wake up rather than in the evening because I worry it has been making my insomnia symptoms worse. Are you upping your dosage this week? I’m currently on 50 mg.
bipolar,fciaidz,t1_fci34qk,1577659762.0,"I have seen a lot of posts about people going through similar situations following a big episode, it’s tough but hopefully we improve with time. You aren’t alone!"
bipolar,fchz0cb,t3_ehbubv,1577655789.0,"I’m sorry you are struggling, I have been dealing with some similar symptoms since my first manic episode in April and was also diagnosed even though the mania was possibly drug induced. Was this your first manic episode?"
bipolar2,fchxbee,t1_fchtkgz,1577655222.0,"Will do, thanks again! (:"
bipolar2,fchny1i,t1_fchieu5,1577652231.0,"Gotcha. Yea I wish it didn’t take so long to get to a therapeutic dose as I’m really hoping for some relief ASAP, but better safe than sorry I guess. I’m currently taking my 50 mg once per day at night but have been worried it’s been worsening my insomnia issues so I may switch it up and try to take it when I wake up instead."
bipolar2,fcgzqxj,t1_fcgy3uw,1577645744.0,"Okay, thank you for the response!"
bipolar2,fc6bthv,t1_fbyt93c,1577476915.0,"I am dealing with these same symptoms and have been for months, it’s exhausting. I recently started Lamotrigine/Lamictal, do you remember what dose you were at when you started to notice improvements? I’m hoping it can help me like it has helped you!"
bipolar,fbyy140,t3_ef8fsh,1577229442.0,Take some deep breaths. I’m hoping I can manage okay at my family dinner tomorrow. Sending positive vibes!
