dragonage,ffiw1ih,t1_ffiro7w,1579984075.0,">Personally I'm not sure, since I'm fine with where the Warden's story ended, and imo they've done quite well giving us just hints at what he or she is doing now

They’ve told us they’re on a mission to find a cure for that disease thing that all warden have, right? I think leaving it at that would be a pretty unsatisfactory conclusion, I’d like to at least know if they succeed and if they end up back with their love interest (if the LI is still alive)."
dragonage,ffiv2qf,t3_etuzp9,1579983436.0,"Even if they don’t return onscreen I hope their story is wrapped up properly and has some effect on the main plot. I get that some people don’t care because their’s are dead, but I’d be pretty disappointed if the last I hear of my warden his vague letter to the inquisitor vague letters, especially considering he has Morrigan and Kieran waiting for him."

I wasn’t interested in doing a same-sex relationship this time but Zevran is ridiculously forward so in the end I couldn’t resist, but I told him it couldn’t happen again. Technically it wasn't actually a ONE night stand though as I let him join the warden and Isabella for a threesome. 

Haven’t played DA2 yet but tempted to have Hawke sleep with both Zevran and Isabella as well cause that would be kind of hilarious, especially as the mage warden is his cousin I think."

More importantly as we’re talking about civ as a game I think Byzantium fills a different niche and has a different character so to speak.

The most original thing DA has going for it as far as fantasy is concerned is the whole magic/fade/spirits/demons thing IMO, if it were to be adapted I feel like it should focus on that. I kind of hope it doesnâ€™t get adapted though. Almost all screen adaptations of games have been shit (Iâ€™ve heard the Witcher is good but it was a book first after all), it would be depressing if there was a DA adaptation and it was awful."

civ,fdogpbu,t1_fdn71ag,1578604791.0,I get what your saying and you have a point. They definitely viewed themselves as Romans but thereâ€™s a reason historians invented the term â€˜Byzantine Empireâ€™. Iâ€™ve studied Byzantium quite extensively at university and they had a HUGE cultural/religious influence on Eastern Europe that is distinctly Byzantine and not Roman. More importantly as weâ€™re talking about civ as a game I think Byzantium fills a different niche and has a different character so to speak. If Greece and Macedon are separate civs it would be really weird to lump Rome and Byzantium together.
