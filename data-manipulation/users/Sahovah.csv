science,ff5zc7h,t3_ernk8d,1579615034.0,"I have a gunny who was just sent to the brig. He was a real asshole. He made us clean up trash in the rain at night. Shortly after he beat his wife & kids & was later arrested. He is awaiting court martial. I I hope they kick his ass out.  I don’t know what he had gone through but fuck that shit. It was a god damn Saturday night. What the fuck is your problem. 

Maybe I am being judgmental. It doesn’t change the fact he showed up to the barracks for no other reason on a weekend to tell us what to do. People like that who abuse their power are seriously pieces of shit.  It was fucking raining."
