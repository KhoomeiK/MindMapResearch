PoliticalCompassMemes,ffc8grc,t1_ffc75g2,1579793938.0,">I have the same thoughts on democracy and transparency, but I feel like power corrupts so much, that you are not safe from voting a person who will change as soon as they get elected. There is also a problem that ""most people might make a bad decision"", and that electing someone based on popularity has a lot of drawbacks by itself.

This is why I think education is the most important of them all. Information and choice mean nothing if you don't know what to do with them.

As for the general situation of the world, we are not fucked. We are as if in a weak wooden boat full of holes. If we do nothing the boat will sink.

PoliticalCompassMemes,ffc6fvg,t1_ffc35ve,1579792631.0,"They are 100% not going to be resolved in a timespam even remotely close to our lifespam. As for the greek philosophers, humanity has had an astounding technological development in the last 2000 years (mostly in the last 300) but the middle ages were a big setback for philosophical development, at least in europe. As a result, we are a little more advanced than them, but not by much. And for politics, most new implementations were developed in the last 200-300 years, with the overall impact of most of them still feeling the after effects of them in modern days, and thus cannot be fully analyzed yet. Hell, even Russia is still feeling the effects of the Soviet Union and the russian revolution that happend over 100 years ago right?

For this reason, independently of my specifical political leanings, I feel that the most important aspects to reinforce right now, in any country, are democracy, transparency and, most importantly, education. We need to develop the future generations to try to think critically and advance the research into all these problems, because until then we are still in the dark. Even if some people now claim to be all knowing about the posible apocalyptic or miracolous effects of some political or economic model or another. They're full of shit and we all know it. Until then, we need as much transparency as possible so everyone knows what's going on in their country, and as much democracy as possible so we all have agency to act with this information."

That's the million dollar question. I don't have concrete foolproof answer. Just thoughts about how to solve it. As I said before, that's what politics is about.

That with China looming over them and the special treatment they had they would never try anything, and look at the news now.
