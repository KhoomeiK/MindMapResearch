I'll try to cover some of your points:

> I understand where you’re coming from, but you’re also making a lot of assumptions. 

Yes and no. There are of course assumptions in this text. In fact, most statements are based on empirical findings from research (Institute for teaching innovations).

&#x200B;

> In *some* cases. Not sure where  you’re getting “many” from since many people are also thrive and are  more successful taking online classes instead of going to lecture 

I have to disagree!  
And I wonder where your ""*many*"" comes from. My statement is based on the above-mentioned data. If I am not mistaken, this data has been collected for eight years now and since then it shows a pretty clear picture, which counts better values for those present in both the factor grades and profession (starting salary). Especially the (adjusted) fail rate is significantly better for those physically present. Unfortunately this data is not available online, so I can't post a link here (yet). Maybe you find a similiar and published study online.

  


> Also, there are plenty of other sources for networking. 

That's right, I agree with you.

But only to a limited extent, because at this age one rarely encounters people who are so concentrated on the same field / industry. Of course, clubs (etc.) are also important. But basically I would say that it becomes much more difficult for people who never visit the campus to meet their relevant network. 

  


> I’d argue going to lecture itself isn’t even a productive way to network  because people are only there for the class and then they leave. 

It's not the core reason for going there. Nor should it be the only source for your network. But it's certainly easier to find people in the same area of interest / major than in the city or otherwise away from campus. Above all, you are much more likely to meet people who can help you in the learning phase to discuss or deepen your exam topics. It is also advisable to get to know people in advance for group work, if you have a choice who you will work with.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

> Again, where are you getting “almost everyone”? 

Try to read some works on the topic ""People and Isolation"". Under social isolation, there are of course people who can work well in the long run. But for the majority it can be assumed that the findings from science are valid and as stated in the original post. (It would be best to search for them yourself, so that I do not only bring particular sources to support the thesis and since I first have to find non-disclosed / freely avialable research papers).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

> Just because you’re taking classes online doesn’t necessarily mean you  don’t have other outlets for socialization and productivity. Even if it  were, who is to say that that’s not okay? 

That's not directly related to my arguments. Here I simply saw the danger, in the context of this post, that social events would be seen as a loss of efficiency. Quite rightly, of course, there are other social events. However, I have already mentioned why I would still recomment not only doing online courses as adviced from OP.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>Some people are perfectly  content with that because it’s working towards their personal goals. 

Some. But not the majority, at least as far as the majority of papers I've read and seen say. Again, I invite you to get your own research so I can't give you biased papers :)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

> You’re assuming email takes long and that there aren’t other avenues for  getting quick answers. Like using the phone or text maybe ;) 

Assuming that you know hardly any or no people from the lecture itself due to the online courses, you usually only have the professor or their assistants to ask questions. At no university I have ever seen, main course related questions are desired via WhatsApp or in short message format. But maybe thats another thing in your country. Would be hard to believe that a prof would share his telephone number to a large courses with 200+ ppl. AND give fast / high quality responses. (But heck yea, that would be great for the students!)

This situation, for me, only leaves the online platform (something like Canvas) or e-mail. Both require formal aspects for a person with a doctorate. 

So for short questions, when you visit the course, you can simply move forward quickly and talk to the person, and if you don't understand, you can immediately ask follow-up questions. The e-mail process obviously takes longer since communication is done asynchronous.

And if the lecturer does not have much time after the lesson, you can still use e-mail for follow-up questions. So I really can't understand this aspect of your objection, sorry.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

> Furthermore, I’d argue that taking  online classes is a more productive use of your time, especially as you  get older and have more responsibilities. It works around your schedule,  there’s no travel time involved, etc.

Here I see the whole thing very dependent on your situation. For short 10-minute walks to the university in the fresh air, I would say that it is rather productive, because you can plan a break for fresh air right away. If it's a two times two-hour drives for 90 minutes of lessons, you are right, I can see the productivity die.

But if you are a serious ""classical student"" living at least halfway near your campus, you should have no problems to plan the courses into your daily life (and with no serious drawbacks compared to online).

Additional point: Here in the Subreddit are primarily people who state that they have problems with discipline. So I think that given structures (""be there or square"") work much better than to plan an online lesson for 10am and then have breakfast until 11am, because you can watch the lesson whenever you want. (And this, ofc, goes on and on..)

Don't get me wrong, I don't want to badmouth video studies, sometimes they are good. But with the empirical data and being disciplined in the context of people who generally already have failed in the past, I see it more as a good supplement and less as a substitute.

&#x200B;

>The  point of this post is to save you hours and take back control of your  life. That’s, partly, what online classes are designed to help you do.

For some, maybe. I see it, as I said, for many people here rather as a danger to completely (as propagated in the post) renounce classical presence.

While at first sight it seems logical not to attend the lecture on site, in many cases this is a fatal mistake.

&#x200B;

**1**) In the lectures you usually get to know other people. Apart from the important networking, social contacts are also important for many people here, in order to build a network that can help you with questions. To discuss things with fellow students is fundamental.

**2**) Above all, this network also sports us. If we are only ""productive"" at home every day, almost everyone loses motivation or perhaps works longer, although empirically this is much worse. 

**3**) On site, you can also ask questions directly and without wasting time for the email route or follow up if anything is unclear.

There are several things that I see here and would like to address. And I start with a question:

Are you afraid to be alone?

Regardless of the answer, these people do not seem to be good friends to me. Sure, I don't know them well enough to judge them just like that. However, good friends should support you in your goals and not keep you from them.

>""I don't know if I want you or not or if I love you or not""

Perhaps this may sound a bit old-fashioned, but:

a) Talking directly about love after two weeks seems pretty early to me

b) It shows signs of emotional blackmailing.

Of course in a relationship, if you have problems, you should talk to each other. However, a relationship cannot be a permanent one in which you are going to give yourself away.

&#x200B;

I would suggest that you consciously design your life according to the circle-theory.

**Circle 1: You**  
In a first step, just pay attention to yourself and your needs. Make sure that you can love yourself and that you do. Be at peace with yourself. Draw your circle right around you.

**Circle 2: Your closest environment**  
This one usually consists out of your own family or very, very good friends. However, it is rather the family. Only - and really only - if you have closed the first circle, you move on to the next one. Now you have time to pay attention to your family, to take care of them and to do something with them.

**Circle 3: Close friends**  
Same as above, now it's about close friends. All other, bad friends (or fake friends) are still irrelevant here. If you don't have this circle yet, get to know new people until you have someone who makes you realize that this person is honest with you and on equal footing with you.

...

and so on.

It's all about setting priorities. And no matter what happens, until you are at peace with yourself, you cannot put others before yourself.

So if your girlfriend is distracting you, tell her that. Tell her that you need time to study, but that she is welcome to meet you afterwards or to write / talk on the phone after work or during defined scheduled breaks. Until then, she should support you by giving you your time - as long as she really only wants the best for you and does not simply take advantage of you. 

Sometimes it takes time to get to know the right people. But it's better to have a few right friends than a lot of fake friends who just pull you down. 

As always, this is only my perspective on your described situation. Feel free to comment, ignore or ask questions if you feel to do so.

* Try to find a new perspective on stuff you don't like / things that are distasteful. 
* Life won't always be easy. Sometimes you simply need to do things so they're done. Motivate yourself by adding small goodies after reaching a subgoal defined beforehand. E.g. treat yourself with some grapes or a few strawberries after reaching a defined amout of slides / pages while learning or after a defined time of focused work (e.g. 25min). 
* Regarding the passion for learning: Think of the future and the goals you want to achieve. What do you want to become? Why are you learning these things right now. Think of your future self (e.g. you in 5 years when you've got your dream job or when you can afford a think you're already dreaming of since you're a child) and then try to think back out of the perspective of your future self. (I know, it's getting complicated).   
Long story short: What are your goals, why are you doing this? Try to think of your life-goals and how this action now helps you to reach them. And to get (even more) happy :)

I hope these three points are comprehensible."
getdisciplined,fegjxgb,t1_fefo0dc,1579095028.0,"At this point I would look at two things. 

**1)** First, there is certainly the obvious way that you take the time to discover new things and give existing things a new chance.

One possibility would be to search for clubs in your area or to use various subreddits to find things you always wanted to try. Especially group sports (even for beginners!) often bring a lot of fun. Even if it needs the courage jump blindfolded into an new experience, go and try it out! And don't worry, most voluntary clubs very understanding and don’t mind if you aren’t that fit or talented at the beginning. Practice is key.

**2)** The second is even more connected to you as a person. Would you say that you allow yourself to enjoy something? Would you allow yourself to find a passion?

Some people have already found a great hobby, but don't stand for it. Either because they think that it is too much against social convection (e.g.: Men who enjoy fashion and make-up and also feel like a man. Or women that would like to join the (voluntary) firefighters). Such prejudices and conventions sometimes stop us from really enjoying things we love or giving them a shot.

On the other hand, we are sometimes caught in a spiral that generally prevents us from enjoying many things. A negative comparison (""others can do it better anyway"") or other things stop us from believing in ourselves. It takes a lot of time, practice and courage. But if you work effectively to update your self-image and allow yourself to enjoy yourself, you can develop a real passion out of it. No matter if it’s sports, something creative or a good discussion with friends.

getdisciplined,feeu1wt,t3_eos8lo,1579041209.0,"Hey can\_omer

I will try to keep it short, because I am not sure if I have understood everything correctly.

Would you rather say that you do a lot **for** others or a lot **with** others?

One thing I often see is that people are willing to do a lot for others and forget to take care of themselves. Or they don't even forget to do it but don't do it because they seem to be ""not important enough"".

This is obviously not right. Because you are well worth pursuing your own goals and working for your dreams. In fact, you should only commit to yourself and people you choose in the end. The trigger can be many-sided, of course. Often however, so far my observation, because people do not really respect themselves. 

It is the basis, which is why for example, you take a shower every morning or eat more than just food supplements every day. But if you don't appreciate yourself enough, you always see the problems of others as more important.

If this is the case for you, I can recommend that you concentrate only on yourself and your needs for once. Remember that you deserve it and that your goals are important. Learn to love yourself the way you are. (And yes, this sometimes is freak’n hard to learn!)

In order to have more time again, make sure you plan for breaks and time with friends and keep them strict. Ask your friends to support you and, for example, not to chat with you when they know you have a work block now. 

If the mobile phone alone is a distraction, working / learning in a new environment (library, work rooms, etc.) can be worthwhile in combination with:

a) Not taking the mobile phone with you at all

b) Only take a $10 mobile phone with you, which does not support WhatsApp/Instagram/etc. and can only be used for real emergencies / phone-calls (downside: sim change required every so often)

c) use apps like Forest focus, which motivate you not to use your mobile phone and punish you when using it

getdisciplined,feerlby,t1_feen67v,1579039711.0,"  Hey BettaKlingon

Thank you very much for your contribution. Standing by your word is not an easy task.

Very important: The following views are based on my experience and do not necessarily agree with you. You are welcome to disagree, ignore it or ask questions.

Basically, this topic can be divided into two sub-tasks, which could be defined as follows:

**A\] Think before you promise something**

It starts with actively considering (at least at the beginning) what exactly a promise means for one's own actions before each promise is made.

You should only give out promises you can AND want to keep.

On the one hand, you should generally not do things for others that you do not want to do at all (""Learn to say no""). Of course, sometimes you have to do such things, but sometimes you should also be able to simply say ""no"".

In addition to that, it often helps to set yourself a realistic and fair deadline and to communicate it this way. If you say “I’ll be done by 10:00 tomorrow” instead of ""I'll do this later / soon"", you can structure your own day better and know exactly when you have too much to do or when run the risk of being overpacked with work.

**B\] Act – Act as you speak**

Keep an eye on your schedule and always have a list of your to-do's at hand. A good way not to lose track here is to take 20 minutes each morning before you start work to look at your to-dos and distribute them in blocks throughout the day. Start with easy tasks to get in easily and break big tasks down into smaller ones.

Important: If you are not able to keep your word (e.g. illness), try to find a solution as early as possible and, in the worst case, honestly describe the situation along with a truly so-meant apology.

**C\] General important things**

To stand by your word, especially when it only concerns yourself, needs a lot of strength, as said before. And above all, it does require a lot of respect for yourself. If you talk yourself down, don’t take yourself seriously or do not respect yourself, then it will be difficult to remain faithful to yourself.

Therefore, I recommend you to deal with yourself before you get into the details of the other points. This may sound silly, but it is usually true;

How will you receive love if you cannot love yourself?

Can you expect others to take you seriously if you don't respect yourself? \[Yes, ofc you can. But it’s much clearer if they know that you respect yourself!\] 

You are an independent person and I strongly believe on the fact that there is no reason to doubt that. If you want to talk more about it, we can do that. But since it will quickly become kind of personal, I would suggest to use the PN function.

Good luck!"
getdisciplined,feeo1nn,t1_feedylx,1579037646.0,"Regarding JL, I can't judge. Yet I have to confirm, if your acting differs widly from your words, things are probably going wrong. And if you are abusing any person, things are definitly going wrong.

I understand your point of view and agree with you, especially on the habitual issues and the connection with action.

At the same time I would narrow it down in two ways.
On the one hand, I think that motivation doesn't come from action alone, but that there is a continuous interaction between action and reaction (where reaction~=motivation).

If you take a closer look at these listed points (above), you quickly notice that they usually do not allude to the motivation itself. Rather it is about improving your own character, hopefully to be more satisfied with yourself. I think that if you're happy with yourself and value yourself, you're much more likely to motivate yourself to do things and stick with it.

On regard of the compliments, once again, I have to agree completely. As I said, the 18 (+1) points were just a short list without written-out limitations. Of course compliments should, whenever possible, be honest and within the appropriate framework. In this context, it should serve more as a reminder (""Hey, why don't you give someone a compliment today?"") and less as a ""do-it-as-much-as-you-can"" statement.

To appreciate oneself, on the other hand, I would discuss it rather in relation with the 3rd point (“accept and love yourself”). Other than that, I can only agree with. Thanks for your contribution.

The most important thing I read that was written by you can be found at the end: Your wife loves you. While I'm sure she makes you smile every day, you just gave me a smile with that statement alone. You seem like a genuinely good husband!

If you ever had a relationship with a ""bad"" person (e.g. someone cheating, not threating partner with respect, etc.), it's sometimes better to leave him/her instead of being mad at the person (=Fiat) for not being your ideal partner or a good person (=Ferrari). Some things can’t be changed, right?

If you can't change it and it drags you down, leave it or find a way to deal with it. But hating a Fiat for not being a Ferrari probably won't get you too far. 

Is it comprehensible? (Sorry, I'm still working on my English-skills)"

I guess most people already know many of these points (or are at least aware of this point of view). At the same time, as you've said before, having these written down or hearing them once in a while might help to stay on track with your personal goals. 

And awesome advise you've shared in your comment. I'm already considering a second part of this""18-things-I-ve-learned""-post since there are many more things to know / talk about."
