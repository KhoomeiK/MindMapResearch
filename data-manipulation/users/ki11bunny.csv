The pointy blade is longer in most cases, as length adds weight and that isnt usually great for a blade that you slash with when its length.

It is if you are trying to use that service.

The claim was that a company couldn't enforce a fee for use of the service.

If you have to pay a fee to be able to use the payment and you want to use it, then, yes the fee is enforceable because there is no way to use the service without it.

Claiming that they cannot enforce a charge means that you can use their service for free even if there is a charge.

If you cant sell that service because free alternatives exist, that makes it unfeasible.

Boom, fucking easy.

Doesnt matter about the other service that has been set up, all that matters here is that they can charge you for using their service if they wanted. You claimed it couldn't be done, it can.

Dont care which it is but they easily could make it so that they can charge you for each email. That wouldn't be hard to implement at all.

And now you make an assertion without even backing it up at all. That isnt how this works, you have to show that they cant charge you like you claimed.

They can and you are wrong. It's a simple matter of just adding some code that makes it so the email cant be sent without you paying for it. It wouldn't be very difficult to do."

Literally a matter of adding a fee to the service. Now you are making an argument that it wouldn't happen because free services already exist.
