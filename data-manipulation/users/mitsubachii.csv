However a simplified variation would be needed for any of the business’s promotional items (like name tags, employee uniforms/apparel, pens, etc).

Also I would add the tag line right next to the established date, either before or after and separated by a pipe symbol (|) for simplicity. I feel like the eye is drawn to too many places in its current state."

sex,ff589ik,t1_ff55qms,1579583159.0,"Yes. Even while you’re penetrating, tell her how good she feels when you’re inside of her, if she likes her nipples played with, give them a squeeze or pinch while you’re fucking her. If you can reach, suck on them too. You can also quickly rub your thumb against her clit while you’re fucking her - this you can do while you match the speed of penetration, if you’re penetrating slowly, rub her clit slowly and as you speed up, rub it faster (as long as she’s not super sensitive and it’s not painful for her to rub it hard or quickly). Pay attention to her body language. If she starts thrusting back at you, speed up the penetrating."
sex,ff57w3e,t3_erp8we,1579582828.0,"Personally, I like to build up the tension with foreplay: Put on that sexy tone of voice and talk dirty in each other’s ears while feeling each other up, dry humping, take off clothes a little at a time, touch each other or use toys over your undies until you can’t stand it anymore. Then when your naked bodies finally come together for penetration, tribbing, pegging or whatever kind of fucking you’re into, the release is that much more satisfying.

Oh and to add to this, mutual masturbation is fun. Lying next to each other and watching your partner please themselves while you make out can be super hot, especially with some dirty talk. Like phone sex but you get to see everything they’re doing."

If they call you for an interview and expect to hear a woman’s voice because you put your birth name only on the app, and instead hear a man’s voice, they’re going to be very confused. The application is your first point of contact, so I would be as upfront as possible.

However if you’re trying to find out about a business and if they’re accepting of LGBTQ+ people, you can do some research before applying. Even go to the place of business (if it’s a public place) and ask some of the employees. Especially because whenever you can, you should apply for the job in person. So when you go in to get an application, ask the employee if it’s a nice place to work, what are the hours like, any benefits, casually slip in the question about LGBTQ+ people “Oh, great! So, are they pretty accepting of LGBTQ+ customers and employees?” And that should get you an answer. Best of luck to you on your job search!"
