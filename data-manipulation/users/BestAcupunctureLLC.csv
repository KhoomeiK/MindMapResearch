selfimprovement,fdnxewy,t3_em8vt9,1578594796.0,"You know, a person I have great respect for said to me, ""You want to change your world? Make your bed."" There are 4 things needed to change your world: persistence, commitment, ownership, and the willingness to show up every day. Start small and give yourself the training you need to learn how to succeed. The day you look at your bed and own the pride of having truly done a wonderful job is the day you will have trained all the skills needed to become a master of your own destiny."
nutrition,fdntn0r,t1_fcwlwy5,1578592595.0,"You could probably cruise pubmed for nutritional research or just take an introductory nutrition course at your local Junior College or College. In general, there are three categories of enzymes produced and sold on the market: lipase for fats, protease for protein, amylase for carbs. Amylase type enzymes are used when talking about fruits and vegetables. A-New-Ope mentioned Similase!"
selfimprovement,fcw1th9,t3_ej28x3,1578015182.0,Sounds like alot of stress and work to just get in front of someone. Maybe try participating in activities you like to do and get to know people in that venue. Then it would be more like finding friends instead of capturing the dragon.
selfimprovement,fcvt20s,t3_eiy0ge,1578009462.0,"Awesome, sounds amazing. Your story reminds me of a famous quote that I use in my life, ""If you want to change your world, make your bed."" Change starts with one small step at a time done in repetition."
selfimprovement,fcvsine,t3_eixloq,1578009118.0,"I really like all the different options here because one of them is going to resonant with you and work. It might not hit all of it, but even if it hits a piece of it, that is one piece closer.  The one option that no one has mentioned is Chinese Medicine and transcendence with Chinese Medicine or changing your destiny. We all have our inner chatter of stories we tell ourselves and how we are not enough. Using Classical Chinese Medicine for transcendence was the one thing that stopped the negative stories, not give me tools to manage my emotions, but stopped the stories. It also opened up a whole new world experience."

Meditation,fcs6u2e,t3_eiiqi8,1577912252.0,"I am a Classical Chinese Medicine provider and it amazes me science confirms what Classical Chinese has taught for centuries. I remember learning about the triple warmer in Chinese Medicine. It was located in the abdomen and had an upper, middle, and lower portion with a key job to regulate water and fluid. Learning the triple warmer was really hard for me because there was no counterpart in Western medicine and it made me question the validity of Chinese Medicine. Then in 2012, the mesentery was identified as a new organ with multiple portions and with the key goal of transporting fluids.... who knew???

nutrition,fckkokc,t3_ehkyz2,1577727423.0,"I'm not really sure. It's different for different people. The gas may be caused by the sulfur content in these items. Or, it could be your body does not have all the necessary nutrients to create the enzymes necessary to break-down these items. That idea is part of the idea of why people have food sensitivities. Enzymes can help over time especially amylase."

nutrition,fcizejl,t3_eh5j0g,1577673488.0,"The big question - does the product have a the green and white USDA Organic stamp. If it doesn't and the package says  ""grown organically"", that means nothing and they are probably considering the fact that they grew the seeds in dirt as organic enough. If it is labeled ""Made with organic"" and does not have the USDA Organic stamp, it means that 70% of the product must be US certified organic. Chia seeds are basically an import crop. In order to be labeled with the green and white USDA organic stamp, they must come from a country which doesn't have a pest problem requiring irradiation at or before the border. They can not use GMO seeds in USDA organic products. The farms have to be inspected by US certifying agent including overseas fields.  This flyer from the USDA may help better explain the differences:   [https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Allowed-Prohibited%20Substances.pdf](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Allowed-Prohibited%20Substances.pdf) Now when we talk about the safety of GMO crops and GE crops, different issues come up. Especially with Round-up as that has been the primary driver of increased concerns. I grew up in Minnesota and we never used pesticides on the fields when I was growing up. I was back in 2016 & 2017 and was floored that the farmers consistently sprayed tons of glyphosphate on the fields. I would sit inside the farm house for days trying to avoid the pesticides that would just hand in the air. Well, this 2015 Harvard study helped explain what happened:  [http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/roundup-ready-crops/](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/roundup-ready-crops/)  . The GE crops actually increased the use of pesticides on the farms. This is being repeated in India with their cotton crop:  [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190225100726.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190225100726.htm) And then this is interesting. Monsanto has already lost millions in lawsuits on Round-up. They are presenting a new defense saying they couldn't have know the product would cause cancer and shouldn't be held liable...kind of like Toyota saying they didn't know their cars had surging problems and shouldn't be held liable  [https://modernfarmer.com/2019/12/monsanto-attempts-defense-that-would-negate-all-glyphosate-causes-cancer-lawsuits/](https://modernfarmer.com/2019/12/monsanto-attempts-defense-that-would-negate-all-glyphosate-causes-cancer-lawsuits/)"
Meditation,fcisfiv,t3_ehdfr4,1577668715.0,"I like what people have said in the comments. Who knows how much practice we need.  We've lived a whole life with no one ever teaching us how to concentrate...until now. I think it may work like learning to ride a bike. I didn't start out riding a bike by myself without training wheels. I practiced, with the help of others. And one day I was suddenly riding a bike by myself."
Meditation,fcir4a6,t3_eh7miv,1577667824.0,"Wow! Congratulations! This may be helpful or may not. My background is a Classical Chinese Medicine provider. I can comment on this sensation from a Chinese Medical point of view. Classical Chinese medicine has 5 areas of specialty: Acupuncture, Herbology, Meditation, Nutrition, and Massage. It's strongly influenced by Daosim, Buddhism, and Confucius thought. When practicing Chinese Medical treatments, the wave of water is the sudden release of Qi. Not everyone gets that sensation and many times people are too distracted to even notice any sensation in the body. Yet, I've noticed with clients and myself, when certain blocks in the body open, you can get this wave of cool water running through the area. It doesn't happen often and may be associated with certain merdians. Good-luck on our meditation."
