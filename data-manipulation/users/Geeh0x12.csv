It'd be very helpful to get that info, so if you could copy that, it'd be great. Also, I'd love to join your Discords. I see your comments quite often on strats & game mechanics, so I'm definitely a fan of yours."
hoi4,ffchuej,t1_ffch0yq,1579799782.0,"You're such a blessing, I owe you a drink.Everything you say helps a lot, these are new considerations that I hadn't taken into account, and I am excited to try them out. I have two questions, though:

1. Tank variant, if you know your enemy can pierce you, why would you skip armour and go for reliability? does a maxed armour not protect you better than a maxed reliability in combat?
2. Industry wise, it's not very clear to me what I should aim to achieve, and I'm aware that this might differ from Germany & USSR. I ideally build civs in highest infrastructure, then after mid 38, do mils, is this the most efficient way? Should I build infrastructure to make it more efficient?  
3. I thought you weren't supposed to mix lights with mediums, but I can see why a 2 medium, 6 mot, 8 light spg might work. Should I rush light spg 3 in this case, instead of mediums?"
hoi4,ffce38v,t1_ffc7zfq,1579797477.0,"I appreciate very much the reply.  
Given it's usually a 1v1, allies don't come into account, competitive MP is too much drama and time consuming for me, so I just play with friends.Most of the time it's vanilla, sometimes RT56. In a 1v1 scenario we often do Germany vs USSR, or a simple 1v1 duel mod. Infantry templates are as such:20W Pure for AI fronts and last defense, barely used. Support companies same as below.20W (7/2) for defense. Support companies same as below.40W (14/4) for attack / general purpose. Support companies are Eng, art, radio, recon, AT.Tanks are 40W, I used to build 10 mediums, 4 motorized, 4 SPART, but I found that 13 medium and rest motorized is better. Support companies are same as above. I unlock 1941 medium tanks around 1940 I believe.Once I tried to use a 20W infantry with 1 heavy tank 1 as USSR, I think I didn't have enough production to shit them out, though.Having no allies, I focus mostly on having fighters to counter possible CAS, plane count being adjusted to match my adversary.

Thinking about it, my main problem in this 1v1 situation is factory count, not having enough factories to do everything, so I can see how that leads to a stall most of the time."
hoi4,ffc1w1q,t3_erxhde,1579789449.0,"This is not the usual advice request. I have 1400 hours, 99% of which are in SP. When I play MP with friends, 1v1 and stuff, I follow meta, the usual 40W, 20W, industry build up, one division training, you name it, but I always either get beaten or go into a standstill against opponents that have much less hours than me. I think my play style might be a bit too turtle-ish, but I'm hoping I can get some inspiring tips, perhaps even division template tips that go out of the meta."

facepalm,ff9ieed,t1_ff992fa,1579713673.0,"I agree with your premise but think it's a terrible idea. Unfortunately it will never be as you say, because the hammer and sickle, the only symbol of communism in countries like Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, is rightfully associated with mass murder. It's high time a new symbol to distance from that is created."
facepalm,ff92gdx,t1_ff8kk89,1579703201.0,"Of course, but at this point it's nitpicking. We can have a long discussion about Communism symbolism. From how it originated to diverging usages, like Mao's refusal to incorporate it because of the direct relation between it and the Soviet Union."

poland,ff6uybm,t1_ff6uk66,1579635414.0,"""steal"" local jobs? There is no such thing as stealing a job. There are a shit ton of Polish workers in the UK that I worked with, they got the job because they fit the requirements, and they receive no special treatment. Or are you implying that stealing jobs is an inherently not polish thing?
If you're hired under the same conditions as an Englishman, it's because you have what it takes, not because you are stealing it.
Even if that were true, unemployment in Poland is extremely low, so your argument doesn't even stand.
I'm not a potato picker, as humble as it is to be, I am part of a highly skilled industry for which I spent 4 years studying.

There's a chronic lack of nurses in Poland, for instance, so in what world would that be full for you? Or are you speaking about the IT industry? The polish diaspora is large, and a skilled workforce might be welcome. Don't worry though, I'm not staying for long, and it's largely due to the sickened mentality like yours."

I'm trying to learn something new and complete a project at least every year, what technologies do you think I should focus on? I have been told to avoid Java and learn Kotlin, for instance, so this summer I will be completing a Kotlin project.
Also, do you think not having a master's degree is a big issue?"
