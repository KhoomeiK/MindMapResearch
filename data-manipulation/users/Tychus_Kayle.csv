Alright. I'm interpreting ""get a lean look"" as musculature that is well-defined, but not very big. Which in practical terms is the combination of moderate muscle development and low body fat.

Before we get to programming specifics, I want to cover a few general guidelines that I wish I had known when I started:

First, training your chest and the front of your shoulders more than you train your upper back can fuck your posture, you should always seek to have at least one set of pulling work per set of pushing work.

Second, you can't outrun a bad diet. Weight loss happens in the kitchen, cardio can make it happen a little faster. 

Third, don't try to lose weight too fast, your target should be at most around 1% of your body weight per week, less if you're at a low bodyfat percentage, more if it's higher. Losing weight too fast will mean that you'll lose more muscle.

Fourth, if you do cardio and lifting in the same day, lift first. Having more energy for your lifts will help you do them with proper form so you don't hurt yourself. There's also some evidence that doing cardio first blocks the secretion of a hormone (mTOR) involved in muscle growth, but if you do your lifts first you'll have already released said hormone.

Fifth, write down everything. If you're on Android I'm a big fan of FitNotes, but you don't *need* an app, it just makes things a bit easier. Writing stuff down is the only way to be sure what your progress actually is.

---------------------------

The [recommended routines](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/) in the wiki for this subreddit are generally solid, but I'm going to recommend to you a variant of the Greyskull LP program. I've personally had excellent results in upper body size and strength since I switched to a variant of it myself a few months ago. Specifically, I'm recommending the [official /r/Fitness beginner program](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/) with a few tweaks to suit your goals. If you're strong enough to do the barbell lifts instead of the dumbbell variants then you'll need a pair of [1.25lbs micro-plates](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JYH7683/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) unless your gym has them.

The tweaks:

You can skip the squats and deadlifts if you don't care about lower body strength or development.

The routine is pretty bare bones because it's not really meant to be your *entire* routine, just the core of it. Add in some accessory work to develop any areas you want to target. I personally do two or three accessory lifts in a typical training day, but my goals involve more muscle size than yours do.

------------------------------------

As a general rule larger muscles like the glutes can handle more strength-focused (high weight, low rep) training, while a smaller muscle like the lateral-head of your shoulder should only be trained at lighter weights (the sort where you can manage more than 10 reps in a set). Heavier work needs longer rests, so while your rests should be around 3 minutes between bench press or rowing sets, 1 minute is good for curls.

Some recommended accessory work for specific body parts:

Chest - cable flies

Butt - barbell hip thrusts

Biceps - curls. There are a million variations with specific benefits, but focus on getting a basic bicep curl down first

Triceps - overhead cable extensions

Upper back - machine reverse flies

Shoulders - strict form lateral raises. When you get good enough at those, give [Egyptian Cable Raises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_ZkxWzYnMc&t=1m29s) a try.

------------------------------------

Optimum training response seems to occur with 5 working sets (not counting warmup sets) on a body part in a given day of training with 10-20 sets in a week. More than 5 working sets in a day produces *less* response, more than 20 sets in a week isn't a waste, but it will give diminishing returns.

So, for instance, if you want to grow your chest, you shouldn't add more than two sets of flies to a day that you're already doing three sets of bench press.

Bro-splits (hit the hell out of one or two muscle groups per day, hit each group once per week) tend to have more days in the gym, but produce vastly inferior size and strength gains compared to a 3 or 4 day full-body split based on heavy compound lifts.

Some advanced lifters such as Jeff Nippard even do a 5 day full-body routine.
