1. “Have you ever noticed how all composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson?”

2. “Right. So you go into Darfur and you go into South Africa, you get rid of the white government there. You put sanctions on them. You stand behind Nelson Mandela — who was bankrolled by communists for a time, had the support of certain communist leaders. You go to Ethiopia. You do the same thing.”


3. “Look, let me put it to you this way: the NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons. There, I said it.”


4. “The NAACP should have riot rehearsal. They should get a liquor store and practice robberies.”


5. “They’re 12 percent of the population. Who the hell cares?”


6. [To an African American female caller]: “Take that bone out of your nose and call me back.”


7.  “I think the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well.  They’re interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well.  I think there’s a little hope invested in McNabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of his team that he really didn’t deserve.”


8. Limbaugh’s many attacks on Obama.

Limbaugh has called Obama a ‘halfrican American’ has said that Obama was not Black but Arab because Kenya is an Arab region, even though Arabs are less than one percent of Kenya. Since mainstream America has become more accepting of African-Americans, Limbaugh has decided to play against its new racial fears, Arabs and Muslims. Despite the fact Obama graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law school, Limbaugh has called him an ‘affirmative action candidate.’ Limbaugh even has repeatedly played a song on his radio show ‘Barack the Magic Negro’ using an antiquated Jim Crow era term for Black a man who many Americans are supporting for president.


9. “We need segregated buses… This is Obama’s America.”


10. “Obama’s entire economic program is reparations.”"

This was just only one symptom of a bad relationship. I bet if you looked critically enough at yours, you will find lots of other things wrong with yours, too. 

It took a year of therapy to realize that I had absolutely no self esteem and that my husband was emotionally abusive and controlling and it was getting worse. Therapy actually made my husband act out in ways he didn’t before because he could see that therapy was making me find my voice, find my backbone. 

Personally, I think you need to leave, she will not get better. Start therapy to prepare you to leave the relationship, not to stay. You have been there long enough to realize this is not healthy and she is not willing to change, even with the help of a therapist. Make yourself future self proud of your current self and get out. I know it feels hard, but this is the price you pay for freedom."
Rowing,fg7a48w,t3_ex56cv,1580587568.0,"I’m old, too and like to row, but at my own pace. I have a Hydrow. It’s like Peloton but with a rower. You follow a coach through various lengths and skilled sessions. The coaches are actually members of the US rowing team. There are also some sessions without a coach, so it’s just a peaceful, go at your own pace type of thing. You “row” in the Thames River, Charles River in Boston and in Miami. You compete against others rowing at the same time. You can also row at the same time as friends/virtual friends by getting their screen names and making sure you select the same session. 

You do have to use the Hydrow erg and not a Concept 2. But it does keep basic session stats on ongoing progress stats for your profile. The subscription is ~$30 a month. My husband, son and I have profiles. I’m not sure if there is a maximum number of profiles per subscription. My son is 15 and on a crew team and rows year round with winter erg in session now, so he doesn’t use it much. Of all the gym equipment we have at home, I use this the most because it keeps my interest. Just using a rower at the gym is like watching paint dry. 

Also, if you live in the US, Row House gyms are popping up all over the United States that are similar to the Orange Theory concept. Part of the class you are on a rower and part of the class you are doing weight training. I haven’t attended a class yet, but three are opening soon near my house."

I understand that you feel powerless in this, but really there is no humor in letting seniors drive beyond their ability. 

We had to take the keys from my parents. We involved their physicians in helping us tell them they won’t be driving anymore.

Maybe you could check when her driver’s license is expiring. Go to the DMV beforehand and find out what they do to determine when a senior is not capable of driving. Maybe she can take the driver’s road skills test along with the written test. Personally, my dad wouldn’t pass the vision test if he were to take it anyway. If your grandma is driving on an expired license, that is reason enough for her to stop driving. Good luck to you."

I organized what was left. 

My dad is relieved. He keeps opening closets and staring into them. My mom knows I have been doing this while she is in the hospital and she agreed it needs to be done.

I will never do this to my children. Because of my mom’s hoarding, I have donated so many of my own things that have no meaning in my life. I will not buy things for the sake of buying things because it just becomes useless junk later on. My kids will only have to sort through functional or meaningful items when I die.
