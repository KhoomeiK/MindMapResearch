MotoG,ffy7nwo,t1_ffwzk32,1580340154.0,The g7 comes with 4/64gb worldwide and the g8 power is 3/32 or 4/64 depending on market. I can't see them going lower than 4/64 this year for everything tbh.
tmobile,ffxnb3g,t1_ffxmwjf,1580328611.0,$1200 or $1300 is what I've seen for the base s20 ultra as an estimate. So $450-550 down payment
MotoG,ffxgm52,t1_ffxfal8,1580324740.0,"Huh, well that's concerning since the g6 plus supposedly does Bluetooth 5.0, that has me wondering if Motorola just sucks at Bluetooth stability. Everyone on r/Android says how Bluetooth headphones never have connectivity issues, but I can barely use mine at the gym and outdoors in downtown Philly, just forget about it."
MotoG,ffxevio,t1_ffxc0xt,1580323732.0,"I don't know about the wifi issue, but my g7 power has the same Bluetooth issue. I've concluded it's likely because the phone is Bluetooth 4.2 and not 5.0 like my earbuds are (airpods gen 2), I tested having a bad connection at the gym with my earbuds, but then used my friend's note 9 and it had no problems with connection at all. You probably need a Bluetooth 5.0 device to fix that issue. I'm waiting for the Moto g8 power for just such a fix."
Android,ffwp6a4,t1_ffw9jew,1580307586.0,Is just be happy if they weren't increasing the price for the biggest standard model by 20-30% every year.
todayilearned,ffvvygg,t1_ffvvcso,1580274899.0,"That's true too, Aldi's setup is depressing for sure. It makes me feel like I'm in the place where all the rejected groceries ended up because there was more supply than demand, and they just threw in some cheap low quality yet still slightly overpriced meat and added staples where branding doesn't matter like eggs and milk and some basic produce and called it a day."
Android,ffvvukh,t1_ffvumm7,1580274801.0,"I couldn't say for sure without comparing a parts teardown for bills of materials, but I'm guessing bigger AMOLED displays that get better each year cost in R&D that passes on to per panel costs plus things like the hole punch camera in them, multiple selfie camera sensors in the S10+ and other sensors too, lots more camera sensors on the back, each one is easily an extra $20-40 in cost I bet, bigger batteries and pushing the limits on energy density for them, even if it's minor improvements, it still adds cost, they also keep getting higher end stuff like the s20 has 12GB of ram now and it's ddr5, that's a lot of ram for a phone and ddr5 isn't even on desktops and laptops yet, getting that stuff first has to have costs too, even if that's for this year and not prior years. Also advancing antenna arrays for multi carrier aggregation and 4x4 Mimo that older flagships didn't do. That's just stuff off the top of my head. Sure the SoC may cost a similar amount, but most everything else has gone up more than inflations because there's more in the phones, and more technically complex stuff to fit in and add."
Android,ffvq8xx,t1_ffvnvxc,1580270258.0,"That helps a bit, makes me wonder if that means carriers will both be buying from the 70mhz of licensed spectrum and also broadcasting on the unlicensed portion still though, the fact that there's a licensed and an unlicensed portion has me thinking that will be split separate from the priority as he described, but not fully sure"
bostontrees,ffveusb,t1_ffvec42,1580262473.0,"Oh absolutely, but I suspect they'll gradually get there even if it takes another 5 years or so."
todayilearned,ffv4yti,t1_ffuowsx,1580255792.0,"Not sure how it is over there vs the US, but I generally dislike Aldi because of the limited options, not of variety of brands too much, but just like they might only have one flavor of a drink brand and it will vary week to week, or they won't have more specialized things or things where you want a specific brand of something."
Android,ffuz4gm,t3_ev6f4p,1580252123.0,"I was just checking the cameras in the g7 line and the g7 plus also had an f1.7 aperture and 16MP camera and OIS. I wonder if the power and g7 are both getting that camera module with OIS this year, that could be a huge upgrade."
Android,ffuxo8a,t1_ffuxg1n,1580251316.0,"Nope, the g7 has 4gb of ram globally. Only certain variants of the g7 power had 3g of ram and 32gb of storage."
Android,ffuu6lc,t1_ffutk0b,1580249405.0,"What I was told is the s20 replaces the s10e, the s20+ replaces the S10, and the s20 ultra replaces the S10+, the S10 5g isn't even available on all carriers and feels like a special one off model that is outside of the standard lineup so shouldn't be compared to the mainstream global lineup which has 3 models per year currently."
tmobile,ffup9ip,t1_ffuna6f,1580246686.0,"Yeah, as an authorized user I had to have my friend call them, troubleshot, said they'd waive the fee, I had to call and place the order and give them my credit card over the phone, it was a hassle and felt insecure, but it worked out in the end. I still don't know why the site refuses to let my account online purchase a phone though and says to call support."
Android,ffumw4b,t1_ffulvql,1580245322.0,"The US does the same thing, but the article makes it sound like CBRS is available now and uses public spectrum the way wifi does, where anyone can broadcast on it. The private spectrum is only 70MHz being auctioned off later this year, and won't add any meaningful capacity for 5g when split between 2-3 carriers."
tmobile,ffulnkq,t1_fftjtc7,1580244575.0,This is why they conveniently make the website not work
MotoG,ffuham0,t1_ffugijg,1580241936.0,"I very much doubt the US will be stuck at 3GB of ram again this year, that'd be the 3rd year in a row for their power/plus line with 5000mah batteries. 4GB makes sense, I'm more surprised they aren't doing 6GB for some variants or models and 128GB of storage truth be told."
Android,ffugns5,t1_ffug5r2,1580241554.0,"The problem is cost of production is going up as they put more and more into phones. A flagship used to cost $200-250 to make, and sold for $600. Now they cost $400+ to make, and so cost $1000 or more. The manufacturers are trying to maintain the same profit margin as a percentage of cost to make vs sale price."
MotoG,ffug1l1,t1_ffub08p,1580241192.0,"2/3GB ram also makes no sense. The g7 and g7 power both had 4/64GB, nothing should go any lower than that a year later."
Android,ffucaja,t3_ev93ek,1580238956.0,"It depends, I buy budget phones for battery life, but they degrade within a year so I'm always upgrading every year, though the same would happen with a flagship. However on a mid-range phone, I find my camera sorely lacking, it sucks for low light, is often blurry, has no optical zoom lens to really get up close versions of shots, there's a lot that's missing in my phone that a new flagship would offer, but for general usage otherwise, midrangers are mostly fine."
Android,ffuar5u,t1_ffu6n8t,1580238042.0,"But all other cellular bands are licensed and only one carrier has access to them in an area. This band sounds like it's open like wifi, so all 4 carriers can use it at the same time on the same tower, and I wonder how that would work"
Android,ffuanfk,t1_ffu7waf,1580237981.0,"The umidigi f2 had worse battery with a 5000mah battery than my Moto g7 power with a similar capacity. I imagine the power 3 gets close or just below the g7 power, but cancelled my preorder to wait for the g8 power tbh."
Android,ffu4nva,t1_ffu3jhs,1580234410.0,"That's fair, though the redmi note 8 pro is actually number 16 on the list, and that site leaves out a ton of devices which probably would fill out the top 10, but I hear what you're saying"
todayilearned,ffu3nzd,t1_ffu03da,1580233795.0,"But hasn't that, plus costs of copper pipes, led people to those plastic flexible pipes now? God only knows what leaches into the water on the hot plastic pipes now, when you shower and if you did use hot water to drink."
Android,ffu1vtz,t1_ffu17um,1580232703.0,"Maybe but the g8 plus didn't come to the US, so at least for that market it sounds like they'll have a new g8 ""play"" and g8 power and nothing else."
todayilearned,ffu1tf9,t1_ffturpy,1580232662.0,"That's tax revenue paid for prizes by winners of a contest. If you as the NFL gift tickets out, you're losing revenue and can probably write it off somehow, and the recipients aren't winning tickets as prizes, they are a gift, which can often be nontaxable."
tmobile,fftyvv7,t3_ev6ryj,1580230734.0,It's a shame these programs don't seem to be making TMobile compete to make TMobile Tuesdays better.
Android,fftlujc,t3_ev6f4p,1580223860.0,"Love how unsure they are on various specs, though it seems they made some serious claims about the camera. Not sure I buy that the g8 has a lower res screen and other downgrades than last year and that the g8 power is now above it though."
todayilearned,fftkfcz,t1_ffsymrf,1580222856.0,"This is really only at large chains, which makes sense but is unfortunate, personally I don't like chains much, and prefer local places, and that means no calorie counts ever"
todayilearned,fftkdbq,t1_ffsv0pw,1580222817.0,"Yeah, particularly if you go to a chain or order a whole plate of something, like if you order an entree, you're gonna get a meal that's really a meal for 2-3 people. I personally like the option of leftovers."
todayilearned,ffs3izz,t1_ffs34ng,1580172240.0,"Personally my body struggles to eat enough, got a small stomach from my mom I think, but I have found if it's high fat or pure processed carb food, I'm starving all the time, if I have food with a healthy amount of fiber and protein, I'm full much more and for longer. Have you ever checked how much fiber you're getting in a day and what your macros are, that is fat, protein, and carbs? If it's a high carb diet with little fiber, it'd make sense if you're never really full, that stuff is hardly filling and passes right through."
todayilearned,ffrqma3,t1_ffrpqbg,1580163643.0,"That depends if people buy them, or if they get subsidized only to get thrown out, and even a subsidy can't make a product free, so stores might still lose money and stop carrying them depending how they actually sell. Hopefully they'd sell well, but only studies and real world tests can predict and model that."
todayilearned,ffrph5u,t1_ffroxmd,1580162927.0,"This is true, tbh I'd also generally advocate for removing the corn and sugar and gas subsidies, let the free market dictate those items, they don't need to be subsidized, it just makes them artificially cheaper to the detriment of society, and this is said as someone who loves sugar and gas"
todayilearned,ffrokjh,t1_ffro873,1580162366.0,"I agree access to unhealthy foods is an issue, but that's also kind of free market economics, it's what people want partially, and the other issue is unhealthy stuff lasts longer, healthy food spoils, so in smaller stores it needs even higher margins, it's just that logically those things don't work well in these places, the same way a big grocery store struggles to get space in the inner city or enough customers in rural areas. I'm not sure how we address these problems, but short of gov subsidy to put healthier food options in places where they don't make economic sense and hope people take to them, I don't think there's much we can do."

Sure it won't hold the same nutrients or be as good for you health-wise, but it will keep your weight at a healthy level if you control overeating. Granted I don't mean you specifically so much people as a whole, but still. No one is forced to overeat, you can eat McDonald's 3 meals a day and lose weight if you just count the calories. You might get diabetes after years of that or clogged arteries, or other issues, but if the target is to reduce obesity, then the biggest determining factor is overconsumption, lack of self control."

Also hasn't income, relative to inflation, bee close to flat for a long time now?

Lastly the Galaxy s20 ultra is 167 x 76 x 8.8mm, the Galaxy Note 8 was 162.5 x 74.8 x 8.6 mm and the S line has been edging to match the note for size on the biggest model, but overall the size isn't really growing much, the smaller S20 and S20+ are a bit smaller and bigger respectively than previous S line models."

tmobile,ff3ty3p,t1_ff3t1ov,1579548785.0,"Yeah but isn't network usage doubling every year or two? So unless spectrum/spectral efficiency add up to more than that, speeds will drop, that or carriers need to add more and more towers to make up for limited spectrum and spectral efficiency. That's why they are so intent on mmwave, because there's not gonna be a doubling of mid or high band spectrum available every 2 years, or even every decade, though hopefully the c band auction helps some and TMobile merges with sprint and puts their spectrum to use properly."

personalfinance,ff3p64h,t1_ff3o65z,1579545857.0,"IANAL but I am pretty sure those are details you can set in a trust. Usually a lawyer or someone maintains how it's invested and managed. E.g. if you wanted a house sold and the proceeds put in index funds, you could leave a family member in charge, but don't have to, and can generally detail out all the finer points of it. If it was me, I'd try to get everything liquidated into easily managed investments in a brokerage on death, making sure all property is sold at market value, and then set a flat amount or percent to pay out to the kids every year. It sounds like if God forbid you did die, you have enough to leave both your kids with $20-40k a year adjusted for inflation annually for life, which is an amazingly stable position to leave anyone in. Just my 2 cents"
tmobile,ff3mqu2,t1_ff3bhge,1579544366.0,A hand or a body can even block it. Remember how a hand in the wrong place caused antennagate on iPhones years ago? Well with mmwave that's just inevitably an issue. Just turning around so your body is between the antenna and your phone can kill mmwave even with beamforming and bouncing signal off objects in theory. It's amazing how weak real world 5g test videos prove mmwave to be

I have a friend who's super for small gov, hated stuff like the individual mandate for insurance, he'd rather just not have it, even though I know he couldn't afford if he, God forbid, got a cancer diagnosis and needed months or years of treatment. I always found it odd, but now I see it's what you're saying, he somehow sees himself in some way as independent and external from society, he doesn't think he needs the help, so he shouldn't have to pay into it. Then again he also worked in government and the military and saw how wasteful and corrupt it all is, which doesn't help either."
