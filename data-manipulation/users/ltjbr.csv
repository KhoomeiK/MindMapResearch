But my point is not whether you should or not, it's that you can choose if you want to."

factorio,ff9e5ts,t1_ff94dh5,1579711063.0,"I only made it because I went in blind. I thought that I was ""almost there"" for many hours. Only when it came time to produce the final sciences (1-10 million of each depending on the type). Did I recognize the scale of what was required. 

Even with blueprints an bots, building the ore crystalizing was quite time consuming. Here's some maps of the base.

If you're really interested, I documented two major constructions. No commentary though, it's mostly just for myself to remember what went in. Not really intended for public consumption.

factorio,ff7483q,t3_erwfs5,1579640794.0,"Ok, an update: I was able to get it to migrate in the following manner:

1. Remove all mods. 
2. Change factorio version to 17.69
3. Open factorio, sync mods with save, restart
4. Load game, save game to new file
5. Change factorio version to 17.74
6. Open factorio, sync mods with save, restart (if mods changed)
7. Load game, save game to new file
8. Change factorio version to 17.79
9. Open factorio, sync mods with save, restart (if mods changed)
10. Load game, save game to new file
11. Add mods that are now part of seablock that weren't back then (if applicable)
12. Load game, save game to new file

boom, up to date. UPS went from 26 on a beefy comp to over 50. Will try to upgrade again when 18.0 versions of the mods come out.

Going straight from 16.51 to 17.79  was erroring, going through the stable versions one at a time resolved it."
factorio,ff6yxs8,t1_ff6b8n5,1579637759.0,"Still would save several hundred hours.

I honestly don't know why so many people are pointing out the effort required for a rebuild. I assure everyone that any rebuilding effort would be less than 1% of the effort required to start over. It's just not even close."
factorio,ff6f50g,t1_ff6bqxj,1579625843.0,"Just because **I** couldn't get it to work, doesn't mean it can't work. There might be a way to get it from 16 to 17, then 17 to 18.

The upgraded save might not work *well*, but even if *no* recipes work, I think we can all agree that having over 200 nuclear reactors, all research complete, and massive array of ore crystallizers is a beneficial."
factorio,ff6aail,t1_ff69l6h,1579622789.0,"Well, the reason I ask is I was never able to get it to work with 0.17 either, now though I have more motivation.

I don't really expect a such a heavily moded version to work between releases, but I figured I'd ask around."
factorio,ff697mx,t1_ff5yndl,1579622089.0,"to be fair, you don't have to update the game when a new version comes out. v17 came out in the middle of my seablock run, no chance in hell I was starting over."
factorio,ff3kbjc,t3_eq2kfm,1579542873.0,"The replay feature is rarely used because, to be perfectly honest, it sucks.

You must enable it when you first start the map, then you must never update factorio ever again for it to work.

The replay quality itself is ok. 

So yeah, no surprise it doesn't get used."

factorio,febym9x,t3_eo9txs,1578964359.0,"To provide some context. This was the 3rd base I built, each base provided the resources for the next. 

Well the 4th base took an incredible amount of time, so this base continually had more and more demands. The red circuit area in particular was a pretty big unscaleable bottleneck, but I was able to squeeze out far more output from it than I ever imagined with some... creative beaconing. 

I think the unnecessary waterways and the railroad going right through the base give it some character.

As shown it is largely idle, but was more than sufficient for providing the materials for the mega-4th base, including over 14,000 tier 3 modules and over 37,000 logistic robot MK4s. It also racked up a respectable 410 rocket launches."

factorio,fea8z92,t3_eo7lr9,1578945778.0,"I used something like this in my seablock 16 save. Though I just connected the all the stations with circuit signals so, I guess not as fancy. 

But the gist was request stations would flip on and broadcast a signal representing what they needed and a corresponding train would be waiting for that signal to move. It would then find an active equivalent provider station to get the stuff and return. I eventually gave up on trying to have the same train handle multiple deliveries though and just gave each outpost their own trains with their own depot.
