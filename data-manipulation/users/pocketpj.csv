fatlogic,ffgnh3g,t3_etbmyx,1579910343.0,"Rave: starting to eat right is actually pretty easy for me during the work week cuz our company uses company kitchen and all their breakfasts and lunches are one serving each and categorizes the food by far/sugar content and lists calories, they even give us a daily allowance for food (to stop us from like ya know driving elsewhere and coming back late) the only way to overeat is if you get the snacks and eat a whole bag of chips 

Rant: I had a problem with anorexia once and now every fucking time I talk about losing weight or eating healthier (I put on too much weight after recovery from that, combined with undiagnosed illness and depression and in general being stupid with food) everyone freaks out and makes sure I'm okay and giving me sweets and pies like please. I will not starve if I have ONE oatmeal bowl thank you"

fatlogic,ff2viiw,t3_er3kr1,1579525768.0,Or maybe I exercise so I can do the Appalachian trail one day without having a heart attack just looking at it
fatlogic,fezmyed,t1_fezc7ed,1579459163.0,No clue. Some people just trying to get me to party honestly or to go out and drink.
