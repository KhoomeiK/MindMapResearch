OW has emotionally impacted people with its knowledge driven progress, its quite emotional ending which has led many to post about how they shed a tear to the final song (that's impact, not warp, claim base, warp for 'hundreds and thousands of hours'), and its *handcrafted solar system* which people have been waiting for ages to see instead of the occasional lazy proc gen game, but NMS only makes you think 'oh, that's a nice hoop the terrain made, haven't seen that 10,000 times'.

Player creations are amazing, but those are player creations making the game for HG. I'm on this sub because I want to see the game not be a rotting turd that people are going to waste time on and realize 'wow, that was a waste' like me.

One last thing. In NMS, have you seen water planets with constant storms that fling you into space, collapsing planets, or binary planets that share sand somehow? Have you ever seen the clockworks of a solar system ticking away as the planets go around the Sun? Of course not, NMS isn't *that* thoughtful, nor does it have that much effort put into it. It can't even have orbits because some playtester was like 'uh, I can't find my way back, duh', so HG removed orbits instead of adapting the UI and adding more instrumentation than a little hologram and a vague speedometer. Just being able to watch the planets spin and orbit over the course of a night, while being able to point a radio at things and detect signals would make the game prettier and more worthwhile. But nope, the 30 people working on the game couldn't do that. Shame."

Mobius made a solar system from the ground up, having to try very hard to make sure that planets like Brittle Hollow (the one that collapses) don't cause a crash. Hello Games handcrafts *one* ruin.
