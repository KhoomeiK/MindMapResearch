The Southern Netherlands also hosted a bunch of important canals and trade cities and argued they would be more profitable if they didn't have to pay taxes for the Northern Netherlands.

The Dutch king was also a reactionary, and inspired by the French revolution, they wanted political freedom and constitutionalism.

The Dutch economy was also struggling with revolutions in France and war between European nations, leading to unrest among the general population.

Linguistic speaking, Flemish and Dutch were far more different from each other then they're now, creating effectively a harsh cultural split between Flanders and the Dutch region, the Flemish elite however spoke French and therefor felt more connected with the Walloons then with the Dutch.

>No one still cares about Belgium.  The only reason it still exists is Flemish apathy and Walloons who want our tax money.

Only people like you who believe they can push through anything they want through the collective throat of the Flemish people. Confederalism is an economic and bureaucratic failure. We're 99% sure it's going to be a massive loss for everyone and would pull us financially in a swamp. This is why the separatists refuse to release any cost estimations. All non-biased experts agree confederalism is going to be a huge failure.

Rousseau tried to include his party in the resurrection. If 2019 was the year of the resistance, I would already declare 2020 the year of the struggle. The struggle to make solidarity mainstream again,' said Rousseau. The slogan 'solidarity works' ran like a thread through his speech.

Solidarity also in the field of climate or security, themes that belong to the core message of other parties. To save the climate, we need a strong government that takes collective action. Ordinary people depend on solidarity for their safety, Rousseau believes. Today, someone with a lot of money buys his own safety. But the ordinary man, with an ordinary job, in an ordinary neighbourhood, depends on politics, on solidarity for his safety. That's why security is a left-wing theme.'

A strong government also means that there is an urgent need for a government. ""I've been pulling eyes like that the last few weeks,"" Rousseau said.

This is pretty much the case for every multi-ethnic  or large nation. How many French Swiss people do you think watch German Swiss television? Or take the USA, how many people from Alabama do you think marry someone from California even though they speak the same language?

Hell, how many people from Limburg marry someone from West Flanders, I bet this number is also extremely low. You're now really nitpicking on issues that are present literally in every nation. I really doubt someone from Vichy is having tons of friends in Paris too.
