sorceryofthespectacle,ffy9677,t1_ffxg919,1580341012.0,"as above so below, as within so without. yes i agree.

the problem is can see in this is somewhat key to our survival as a species, in nature less evolved organism such as viruses and bacteria can often times end up killing their hosts instead of living in a symbiotic manner. while more advanced or adaptable creatures are able to live harmoniously with the host(with nature).

Humans have in a way gone backwards from living harmoniously with nature and are both a threat to themselves and the rest of the living that surrounds them.

The course of action mankind has decided upon is largely based on philosophical thought, ideas. Perpetual materialism is an idea, an idea that the majority conscientiously has for some reason decided upon investing in. 

I could be wrong in this assumption in stating that we have a choice, we may be slaves to our biology or systems that rule us. there is some scientist i read about, can't remember his name but he committed suicide because he couldn't cope with this thought.

this is where the idea of astrology comes about; some people thought that these patterns or answers could be found outside ourselves out there in the stars. similarly others thought that some answers could be found internally within, philosophers, Buddhists, alchemists, etc. Personally I agree with what the ancient egyptians had to say about the human body in that we stand somewhat as a metaphorical representation of the cosmos at large and vice versa. There are definite and definable states of being, such as healthy and conversely sick or ill. Confusing oneself into believing that poison or a state of illness is somehow healthy or more desirable is foolish. 

don't follow the infected fools they will destroy you along with themselves. it is important to care for the well being of others as we do not live this life alone. those who are outside of ourselves are an extension of nature and they should be cared for, as we tend to the garden of our imagined creation. create and grow a garden that is aesthetically pleasing and pleasurable to walk in."

sorceryofthespectacle,ffw6e13,t1_fftdzyg,1580286446.0,"how can money be real if i'm not real, checkmate capitalists"
sorceryofthespectacle,ffw5xv6,t3_ev4eld,1580285845.0,"money is the representation of potential labour or resource, you could say that is it simply representative resource as the labour is itself a resource to create more capital. what does this mean ultimately; money is energy. the banknotes are not useless, they function as a virtual exchange and represent this actual or potential energy. the problems arise when there is a massive discrepancy between the real energy value and the fiat/virtual representation.  

it's complicated and i have likely made mistakes in my assumptions, but i'm not too concerned. there are i believe systems above systems, the economic systems we have created as humans, the artificial ones are born of the organic processes of our own biology. capitalism for example appears to me as a form of economic natural selection for example. it appears to me as a memetic fractal replication of sorts. businesses are like the competing or often times symbiotic micro-organisms, they compete, destroy one another, combine with others to become more successful or powerful, etc. the system itself stems from some kind of archetypal base pattern. this is what Pythagoras meant by all is number, the complexity of nature arises out of the relationships between numbers/data or information. maybe what i wrote is idiotic I really have no way of knowing.

an interesting aspect of a smoke screen in that if you shine a beam of light, like a laser through it, the beam will pass directly through the smoke in a straight line. seemingly unfazed."

This is false; you may be thinking of the Goblin. The rat will certainly engage in combat if angered or he senses an easy opportunity. 

People don't even talk about the Goblin, he is extremely illusive, some people don't even think they exist but let me tell you otherwise. You know why you never find any good loot? You know why the LEDX is always gone? Now you know. Goblin's frighten easily and normally you won't even know they were there."

auckland,ffb27tq,t1_ffapwqt,1579749942.0,"They were never there to keep you safe. That is personal sentiment or personal moral duty. Police are hunters, it satisfies that instinctual need to hunt and capture prey, or destroy enemies of the tribe or perceived threats. You don't really have to worry much about them though, because like a dog they will do as their master commands. I doubt the situation would get as bad as gas-chambers, that's maybe a little too much work for not much benefit.  

Creating artificial problems like drug-wars is more the flavour of today."
auckland,ffakcvq,t3_es9x4m,1579737894.0,"fear and intimidation tactics to keep the plebs in check. it is a deterrent, you notice it and that is the point. you are being watched 24/7 and they want you to know that, you step out of line and they will take you away and no one is going to stop it from happening and no one will hear from you again. 

that is how law enforcement works, fear. the law also needs to make themselves appear relevant to their handlers. perceived threat increase requires more officers and equipment which means a bigger budget, more consolidation of control. it has nothing to do with your protection or justice. an increase in crime or threat is a good thing for law enforcement; this equates to more resources being allocated, more power, more control. the only difference between the law and criminal enterprises is that the law has the backing and approval of the state, they run the show. well not run it but manage it."
