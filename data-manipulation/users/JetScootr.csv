I normally don't require accommodation, but I have had to deal with it, and found this out. The school is legally obliged, anyway.

scifiwriting,ffdsijj,t1_ffdqp4b,1579827822.0,"Oh, no. That was unproven assumptions made by early scientists who compared dinosaurs to modern reptiles; they extrapolated what a reptile's metabolism would be capable of if scaled to the size of the dinosaurs they were finding. They also didn't know about the higher level of oxygen the dinos were breathing.

Think birds - because birds ***are*** dinosaurs. Not an offshoot of the family tree, nor ""similar to"" - they were dinosaurs, and still are. Now you'll read of scientists talking about ""non-avian dinosaurs"" - they mean the ones that didn't survive Cretaceous.

So in predicting how the non-avian dinos acted/reacted, research modern bird behaviors. Some birds have reaction speeds humans can't even see.

scifiwriting,ffdqsik,t3_estlq2,1579826688.0,"I'll take a stab at the first sentence: First, it's a runon. I'm with [Ragnaraj09](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ragnaraj09/), I like punchy lines, not long ones.

*Fleeing from a nuclear apocalypse on Earth to a new planet* \- probably not needed to hook the reader, try something like ""*Fleeing a dying Earth""*  Everyone would assume to a new planet unless you told them otherwise.

*Amlan Javali and his entire town find himself and everyone on the spaceship, The Tervery,* 

For a grab'em blerb, you don't need the name of the ship, unless that's key to a plot point. Also, Don't need to fully ID Amlan and *who* is on the ship. Again, unless you tell them otherwise, people will assume if there's a ship, everyone on it is affected. Try: ""*Amlan  and his friends find the ship...""*

""*redirected to an unknown galaxy through a wormhole somewhere in deep space"".* Amlan wouldn't necessarily know the where to or how, would he? Unless he's a crew member with access to external sensory information. So you don't need ""*an unknown galaxy through a wormhole""*  and ""*in deep space""* doesn't really apply if they wind up on a new planet, right? That leaves us with:

 ""*Fleeing a dying Earth, Amlan and his friends finds the ship somewhere.""*

Obviously, this needs some punching up to really grab the reader. ""on a planet filled with danger"" or some such can replace ""*somewhere*"".

Now, it's possible there was some information implied in what I cut that is actually essential. Weave it back in. The sentence I came up is NOT better than what you had. All I've done is to weed out the information not needed when trying to grab the readers' attention.

Plan out what information the reader needs to know to get hooked. Write it like a screaming tabloid headline. Remember, this is just a blurb to make the reader know they *must* read this book. Think two half sentences per plot thread. Another half-sentence or two to make it stick together and make sense. 3 full sentences. I'd suggest adding a bit about the dangers and disasters that they'll have to deal with, but not as spoilers, but as teasers."

Cars would be armored, because predators are used to breaking open the crunchy outside to get at the gooey tasty inside. Remember, predators strike *fast*, not like hollywood monsters that stalk and roar a lot. a real predator doing that would starve to death.  Expect armored buildings, hi armor walls around towns, etc. Dinos getting in would be a big deal, could make for an interesting subplot.

We don't know a lot behavior of dinos, except that some raptors hunted in packs. Expect to have analogs for all the hunting methods seen today. You can be creative here; good research will endear you to the dinophiles in your readership.

AskReddit,ffda49j,t3_et033v,1579816426.0,"I accidentally started a bomb scare at a major US gov't facility.

Edit:

Ah, so someone is actually reading these questions.  OK, I'm gonna hafta blur a buncha details, but you understand....It was a facility with a business side (offices, desks, copy machines, etc) and an operations side (huge fricken computers, machinery they were hooked up to, raised flooring, control consoles, etc). 

This was before 9/11, before the first attack on the towers in 93. Terrorism wasn't such a big scary propaganda tool. 

The facility was being prepped to handle secure operations, that is, Department of Defense stuff that was classified. This involves tons of work setting up and practiciing procedures, then demonstrating to the IG (Inspector General) that you know how to keep classified data under control. (PS - if your only knowledge of classified data handling is Hollywood, they get this wronger than they get any other topic in any movie or TV show.)

So I'm coming in to work one night (24/7 ops) and punch in my number at the security door. Someone before me has left their briefcase right in front of the machine, so I scoop it up and take it in to the operation's managers office. It's night, and ops control is sorta the focus of everything, so that's where the owner is most likely to look for it. Ops manager, once he hears where I got it, says ""Well, you can't bring it in here, it might be a bomb!""    Oh, crap. There was no security drill stuff scheduled for that night, I'd just walked into an unscheduled test. That meant the customer (US Gov't) and the IG (More US Gov't) and possibly the DoD (Even more US Gov't) were all there. 

And I'd just brought a bomb into the middle of it. 

Mind you, there was absolutely no thought in the minds of anyone in the building that the briefcase DID in fact contain a bomb. But if this was part of the security shenanigans, we had to treat it as real. OK, I hadn't even read there was a procedure for this (as it turns out, there wasn't) so I asked Ops Mgr ""AAAAGGGGHHH! Ok, what do I do with it?""

his reply, and this is where it all went south: ""I dunno, take it to security, I guess"".

Y'see, ""security"" is your run-of-the-mill rent-a-cops that provided door security to every building on the site. THey have nothing to do with what goes on inside the buildings. They have no knowledge of classified info handling, or procedures thereof, etc. They may not even know we had a IG drill happening. 

I take the briefcase to security, explain the situation. I carefully told him it wasn't really a bomb, no no no. It's just a security game the IG was playing and we had to treat it as real. So he took that to mean ""treat it as real"".

My assignment that evening took me to an out of the way corner of the building, so I didn't hear the sirens or see the flashing lights of the fire engines and site security show up. Luckily, the rent-a-cop hadn't gotten my name, so I wasn't tracked down or roasted for starting the bomb scare.  I was able to tiptoe out at lunch and tiptoe back in without getting caught.

Never heard anything about it after that, so I guess they all figured out what was really happening."

scifiwriting,ff704bh,t1_ff5f2sx,1579638449.0,"My first thought about a trip to the Cretaceous - the world looks very similar to today, because so many modern plants got started then; flowers, flowering trees, etc.

But when things start happening, (My thought here, don't have a link) they happen very fast. Some birds have reflexes so fast humans can't even see them move. Some songbirds, when filmed in slow motion, were seen to be jumping up & down just enough to slam their feet on the perch, but their bodies didn't actually go up and down, only their legs & feet. They produced a clapping sound at \~150 Hz that bird experts had always thought was made with their wings.

Assuming dinosaurs, like raptors, have similar reflexes, death would come fast and bloody and humans would have to use computer-controlled weapons (like the Phalanx system) to get the dinosaurs before the dinosaurs got the humans. No way a human with a gun could ever get it up and aimed before being eaten."

There were lots of birds then, too, but I'm not sure how many of our modern birds were around then. Also, please don't have an erupting volcano. That's been done to death. (totally my opinion about volcanoes)

There's a lot about the common ""understanding"" of the age of dinosaurs that is wrong."

Not highly effective if counting the bombs that missed as reducing effectiveness. They had to drop planeloads of bombs just to get one or two on target. CEP (Circular Error Probability) is an ellipse that a bomb is sure to land in when released from the plane. Years after the war, lasers and analog computers were used in jets to reduce CEP as much as possible, but it was still measured in hundreds of yards. In other words, the bomb is just as likely to hit the building across the street as it is to hit the desired building. And that's dropping dumb bombs using computers and laser target designators.

In WWII, their CEP was measured in 1000's of yards. That can be over a mile, easily. Documentaries say they missed by miles routinely. That's your ""extremely expensive"". ""highly effective"" only happened when hundreds of bombers dropped thousands of bombs."

PS: Germany's main enemy was the Allies, not the Jews. Though Hitler was the Jew's main enemy. So far as I'm aware, and I haven't made a big study of it, the Jews did nothing to Germany except exist within reach. If the Jews had not been in reach, Hitler would have picked someone else to be the ""enemy"" and the target of internal violence. This is a common pattern with violent autocrats - the need for someone to blame for what the autocrat is doing."
