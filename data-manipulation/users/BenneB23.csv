relationships,fgs2sgz,t3_ezwi1q,1581068631.0,"How will you ever satisfy her needs in the long run, when she can have all the luxury she wants in the blink of an eye.

Is she going to play house with you later, take care of errands, build a life together, slowly but surely? Or is she just going to look for easy, fast ways to make a lot of money?

She tried doing it the normal way, working minimum wage dead end jobs like the rest of us, and couldn't handle it.

What will your future look like? When do you make enough for her, so she doesn't need to pursue these activities? You cannot compete with millionaires, I wouldn't even want to try."

relationships,fgs0fj0,t3_f04rv6,1581065228.0,"It's a terribly thing they did, but they owed up to it right away. If it's true that it's just a one off and they immediately came clean, I feel like this may be a situation I could eventually live with."
movies,fgpe2bo,t3_ezsur6,1581002929.0,"When I started reading I immediately thought of the scene where Harry was riding Buckbeak. I'm glad you mentioned it as well. I regularly listen to the music from that scene just to re-live that moment. 

Prisoner of Azkaban for me also has one of the best storylines. I really enjoyed the book. JK Rowling's extraordinary writing abilities really came to fruition from this point on. 

Important to note is that this was the first and only movie directed by Alfonso Cuaron (known from Oscar winning pictures Gravity and Roma)."

Dexter,fgop5ay,t3_ezmxux,1580979636.0,"I would have to say Trinity as well. There was something really off-putting about John Lithgow holding a woman in a bathtub while she's bleeding out, making her look at her own reflection in the mirror. Especially when coming to the realization at the end that he did the same with Rita. You didn't even have to see it, just knowing what he did made me feel awful."
relationships,fgoorrc,t3_ezflsx,1580979084.0,I feel really bad for you having to go through this and not even getting the support you deserve from your significant other. You should know that if something like this would happen to my wife I would want to be there for her every step of the way to make her life easier. You deserve the same.

Don't really have much else to say. I don't really understand why people try to guilt- trip you into a raising a kid which isn't yours, with your adultering fiancé. A sure-fire recipe for disaster."

relationships,ffwish9,t3_evm2l0,1580302412.0,"I don't think you want to have this dynamic where she can call you names to have control over you and then make up for it when she feels like it.

Don't brush it off, if she calls you stupid, call her out on it and say you are not okay with it. Not now, not ever. If she doesn't understand, leave and let her sit on it for a while."
howyoudoin,ffwguii,t3_evdnkr,1580300537.0,"This is a really great gag from Phoebe and so relatable. People often crack up telling their story without providing enough information for the other people to join in, so it's often met with awkward laughter. This is a great exaggeration of such a situation, providing no information whatsoever to join in.

The writing on this show was just amazing."
relationships,ffth9tc,t3_ev55mc,1580220502.0,If she wanted it enough she wouldn't be too scared to try. It's just a smoke screen. Don't read into it too much.

howyoudoin,ffelfft,t1_ffe0uoy,1579853033.0,"This + also the time and setting of the show was perfect. This was a time where people would gather in coffee houses and talk about their day to day life. It's just so immersive and fun. 

We have it much easier now to keep in touch, with our abundance of electronic devices, but they do take away a lot of the charm..."

todayilearned,fen16ze,t1_femvm1n,1579274674.0,"It's a fair question, so please don't downvote him. Taking dramatization effects aside, the only way for a person to get away with what he did for 23(?) years is if you are incredibly, incredibly smart."
todayilearned,femq9fb,t3_epye6b,1579266422.0,"I saw his series on Netflix and though he obviously went the wrong way with getting his message out by hurting innocent people, there is a very strong idea/message behind his philosophy and I couldn't help but feel extremely in awe of his dedication/commitment.

Also, he underwent very abusive 'therapy' sessions as part of a University class where they broke his self esteem and trust. I think it was part of a CIA program. Absolutely awful what they did to such an up and coming, extremely intelligent man. He could've been the next Tesla/Einstein/.. you name it."
bobross,feme5ei,t1_fekcfyc,1579250820.0,"Wow. That is absolutely amazing. 70 % of the painting??! You are a true artist. I also like the painting with knife technique, but I didn't know it was possible to have such good results. 

I tried the wet on wet technique for a while, but I didn't get the results I liked and thought it was only possible to gain high texture paintings with acryl paint. Now that I've seen what you can accomplish, it motivates me to give oil another try."

Now I'm 30+, it's cringy and nobody likes it. I feel like this opinion is very much age-related."

friends_tv_show,fed0me6,t3_eoh4s8,1578992711.0,"I don't see it. Rachel was just as manipulative with Ross as he was with her. Remember the cassière who wanted to date him (Rachel: that sl\*t). Ross was fine and happy with Julie until Rachel came and interfered with the relationship. Didn't she originally go to London as well to stop Ross from marrying Emily?

Mark was trying to get in between Ross and Rachel from the get-go and Ross called it early on. Conveniently Mark 'waited' until they were separated to 'make his move', but he did purposely raise his voice when Rachel was calling with Ross to make him aware he was in her apartment. This led Ross to believe she was 'with him' and make him cheat with the copy girl. If he hadn't done that, the disastrous break-up wouldn't have happened.

Also, since when was it her life long dream to live and work in Paris? She loved to live in New York with her friends. This was just an out of the blue plan to get a fresh start. Also, this meant she would raise Emma without Ross, which is pretty heartbreaking.

I love Rachel, but I love Ross more. Remember, he's her lobster."
