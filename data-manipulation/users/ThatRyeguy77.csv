SegaSaturn,ff27lv0,t3_er7n2u,1579496119.0,"Model 1 all the way for me. Bought one in September of '95 and always loved the look. The oval buttons are sleaker and much more appealing to me. The Model 2 circular buttons look ugly and cheap imo.

However, I do really like the look of the Japanese white Model 2. Wouldn't mind having one."

MortalKombat,fdsfvkt,t3_emugkb,1578701846.0,I think you should D2 more.
socialanxiety,fdpvlgx,t3_emkabg,1578642310.0,No advice. I just wanted to say job interviews are bullshit. I fucking hate them. That is all.
socialanxiety,fdjhej5,t3_eljzdj,1578470914.0,"This post is really touching to me. I'm sorry you went through that at such a young age. Personally, my really bad social anxiety didn't start until my teenage years."
SegaSaturn,fdjh4wm,t1_fdjg5vl,1578470578.0,Damn straight. Baby that incredible console. It needs love and care.
socialanxiety,fdjg5ei,t3_elmkfm,1578469359.0,"People who have never experienced it can't even begin to understand and should shut up. I'm 38, dropped out of high school 20 years ago because of crippling social anxiety."

Anyway. Get a flashed cart with PsuedoSaturn and you can run burned disks from any region. If you want the best video quality through hdmi look at the new RADX2 cable from Retro Gaming Cables."
stopdrinking,fd0v7na,t3_ejswrs,1578124207.0,What kind of tea? Be careful with drinking too much green or especially black tea at night. The caffeine content could keep you awake. One of the hardest parts of quitting drinking is trouble with sleep. A nice herbal sleepytime tea would be best. Congrats on finding something that helps!

Anxiety,fctl3n2,t3_eirg4o,1577947251.0,"Wow. Thanks for sharing this. I have been dealing with this exact issue for awhile now. I have a huge fear of dying suddenly, like from a heart attack, aneurysm, etc... I'm about to turn 39 and I think to myself that the older I get the higher my odds of something like this happening. I don't know what started this thinking, as I don't really know anyone personally who has died from anything like this. I know my grandfather died of a heart attack in this 50's, so I know this makes me very paranoid about a heart attack.

I try my best to ignore these thoughts. One of the main things I concentrate on is the odds. Like how many people actually have aneurysms within the world's population? Oh, I'm also convinced I will have cancer. Damn these thoughts."

I personally don't mind having paid full price. I just want to do my part supporting Sega so hopefully we'll get a mini Saturn or Dreamcast in the future."
socialanxiety,fcjjwp6,t3_ehgrtt,1577690549.0,"Unfortunately medication usually isn't very effective in treating social anxiety. I've tried Paxil, Celexa, and Lexapro, and none of them have ever done much for my social anxiety. Supposedly CBT is one of the only ways to truly treat the condition."
