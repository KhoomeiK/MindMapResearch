unpopularopinion,ff9n9jt,t1_ff8onmb,1579716555.0,"Yeah honestly I've seen the ""read the books"" comment both on this post and on other people's posts pointing out flaws in the TV series, and it kinda baffles me. Like that's not the point of a TV show lol"
unpopularopinion,fevc9m0,t1_fevaq7b,1579395715.0,I'm not sure I understand lol
unpopularopinion,fevboh6,t1_fevato0,1579395470.0,"A show should be able to stand on its own lol, but sure, start name-calling

Also from what I've been hearing it deviates in pretty important ways from the books."
unpopularopinion,feupmck,t1_feuotlp,1579388778.0,"Was it required for her to go through the transformation to ascend? That wasn't really explicitly said in the show, and so I wasn't assuming it was a requirement.

There are other options besides being a sorceress. She really could've done whatever at that point. She chose to seek out the transformation and to do it quickly without herbs. That was not forced on her."
unpopularopinion,feuntek,t1_feumorp,1579388356.0,"He told her before her transformation exactly what the cost would be. And she didn't have to go through the transformation, it wasn't an absolute need. And yeah she could've made an irrational decision, but her going on and on about not having a say in it after the fact is bs"
unpopularopinion,feuadm1,t1_feu87ce,1579384665.0,"To be fair, you didn't do a great job of expressing that in your original comment"
yuumimains,fepezvt,t1_feouxlp,1579318850.0,"I'm sitting at iron rn, but also climbing and relatively new to league lol. My boyfriend is also plat though and plays with me a lot, so maybe I can get him to try it"
yuumimains,feonagj,t3_eq2ali,1579302551.0,"If I wasn't in NA and a lot lower rank than you, this sounds like it'd be fun"
yuumimains,feo33ul,t3_epx7w6,1579294511.0,How has your cs been comparing? Those don't seem super high for how long the games were but idk if it's the elo or if you ended up down in cs?
AmItheAsshole,feliw33,t1_feliowm,1579223253.0,You're not the only one who misread! Glad I could help :)
AmItheAsshole,felijnn,t1_fel9zdh,1579223010.0,She already said in the post she and her ex-husband were splitting it 50/50 to each donate to their charity of choice
AmItheAsshole,felhztr,t1_felhvhh,1579222631.0,"She's likely grieving and may not be in the emotional state to know for sure, to be fair. But yeah this one seemed pretty clear"
AmItheAsshole,felhv7g,t1_fel4s8o,1579222542.0,Why is the stepdaughter not an asshole?
AmItheAsshole,felhtva,t1_fel4rku,1579222518.0,The ex husband is donating his half. Her current husband (the father of her stepdaughter) is the one saying she shouldn't donate her half now and instead give it to the stepdaughter.
AmItheAsshole,felh23t,t1_fel1yjm,1579221994.0,"The other half was for the ex-husband to donate (the daughter's bio dad, who did contribute to the fund), not her current husband"
AmItheAsshole,felgtss,t1_fekzpmz,1579221840.0,She made an edit saying the stepdaughter has been asking repeatedly about it
AmItheAsshole,felgfvi,t1_fekyx4u,1579221587.0,"I think what makes the stepdaughter the AH in this situation is that 1. She openly dislikes OP, 2. OP and new husband have been married less than a year. OP is barely even her ""parent"" and only 3 years older than the stepdaughter. And 3. The stepdaughter didn't just ask once, she's been badgering OP a lot about this since asking."
AmItheAsshole,fdqij4a,t3_emimf3,1578667522.0,"This is so thoughtful, I'm not sure why she's reacting the way she is tbh. I would love if my bf did this (if I even knew my own schedule lol). NTA"
gamesuggestions,fdoo7bc,t1_fdoltk1,1578609182.0,"Yeah I had the same experience, playing at night without knowing how it went for sure"
ChoosingBeggars,fdljw8v,t1_fdlhqp7,1578525678.0,Not necessarily for a bird if the owner declined certain tests or services
ChoosingBeggars,fdlbrsm,t1_fdkzzkx,1578520649.0,This isn't how all clinics run
ChoosingBeggars,fdlbdrs,t1_fdktf9g,1578520418.0,...dehiscence is a common concern after a spay. After hearing the description of the stitches I would immediately think of it and I'm only a vet student rn. I'd be pissed too
ChoosingBeggars,fdlaixp,t1_fdl5q98,1578519911.0,"Yes, that's right, unfortunately"
ChoosingBeggars,fdlaa93,t1_fdl0elf,1578519769.0,"Also, the specialized knowledge needed to work with exotics tends to make exotic medical visits more expensive"
AmItheAsshole,fdegt0x,t1_fdeg8if,1578338705.0,"1. I'm not OP. And if I were, your response is rude af.  


2. They didn't try. They made fun of them when they physically couldn't do things. And also, they're leaving him/her ALONE when they go do these hikes that he/she can't PHYSICALLY do.  


3. They did choose not to go, which is what the family is saying makes them the asshole... So by saying E S H you're saying that OP sucks for choosing not to go."
AmItheAsshole,fdc5411,t1_fdbrlr9,1578267283.0,"Being family doesn't make them entitled to your time or memories. Going on the vacation where they can't do anything and would be made fun of would not be making ""good memories"" anyway"
AmItheAsshole,fdc4tg1,t1_fdbio0t,1578267121.0,"They're not against the rules anymore. And if that much of their family is so vocally calling them one, they probably need the validation"
AmItheAsshole,fdc4jlp,t1_fdbxaez,1578266970.0,"If they do have an entire side of their family against them, they probably do need the validation (which also isn't against the subs rules anymore)"
AmItheAsshole,fdc4dlo,t1_fdbthu5,1578266878.0,Why?
AmItheAsshole,fdc49wj,t1_fdbsgx5,1578266819.0,"Why? They're making fun of them when they physically can't do something, and having to sit bored in a hotel? No thanks"
cats,fdao7m5,t1_fdanal9,1578248322.0,"It is! And I'm a vet student now, so very much up my alley"
cats,fd9uhqv,t1_fd9l7tk,1578238217.0,More Minnesotans! I was hoping to see some in the comments. I used to volunteer at their Coon Rapids location! :)
cats,fd9uba6,t3_ek8pux,1578238132.0,"Hey! Another Minnesotan! I used to be a volunteer at their coon rapids location for 5.5 years. Adorable cat, and the perfect name lol"
AmItheAsshole,fd12ugo,t1_fd041qa,1578126999.0,They absolutely can be. Especially in equine medicine (and especially when you're doing pre-purchase exams).
TeamfightTactics,fcwmrbs,t1_fcw71xr,1578030047.0,"He just does an execute if they're not the same star level though, apparently crystal doesn't work against it (others have been saying it in the comments too)"
AmItheAsshole,fcwm5dk,t1_fcwlxnc,1578029513.0,"Might be because this year it was a Saturday, so they assumed it would be a Sunday next year. But since it's a leap year, everything after 2/29 is pushed forward a day."

cats,fctineb,t1_fct7ep5,1577944578.0,"If it helps you with the thought of ""oh god this needle is huge,"" we've been told in our vet school clinical skills labs that while you don't want one too big, having a bigger needle can make fluids less startling because it's less of a tiny ""jet stream"" that can feel kind of sharp compared to one that's a little wider (if that makes sense)"
yuumimains,fcqd47o,t1_fcqcrgp,1577883630.0,"Singed has been a newer one for me. Honestly have gotten most of those points from arams, but he's so much fun"
yuumimains,fcq5hpo,t1_fcmxino,1577879156.0,Yeah the first time I went back and played yuumi after her changes I was so sad I wasn't able to just jump in as much. I liked being able to do more than just make my adc last longer
yuumimains,fcq3wyi,t3_ei9xs5,1577878185.0,"I've only been playing a few months too! Just hit 7 like a week ago, congrats! I only have mastery 4 on cait and morgana so she's definitely who I've been playing most"
Veterinary,fccqcri,t3_egx7kn,1577601395.0,"The medical director of the clinic I'm at has allergies (rabbits are the worst among those we see, but certain cats and dogs will trigger it too) and also didn't get her first animal until she was already in vet school. She's taught me a lot and seems to be very successful as a vet. Neither one of them are deal-breakers!"
entitledparents,fc7skxp,t1_fc7ryjg,1577517564.0,Oh you're right! My bad lol
entitledparents,fc7r2b5,t1_fc7qzuu,1577516459.0,"True, I was only pointing it out for the longer comment because it really needed it more lol"
veterinaryschool,fc7qdsg,t3_egm5xi,1577515975.0,"Like the other commenter said, working as a kennel attendant or vet assistant is an option. Volunteering at a shelter, working around a farm, or seeing if there are animal-related (or ones involving mice/primates in general) research projects happening that you can be a lab assistant for over the summer are also some ideas"
entitledparents,fc7otey,t1_fc7okhx,1577514621.0,"It would make your comments much more easily understood. You have zero punctuation in that longer comment.  

Edit: missed one period in the middle"
AmItheAsshole,fc5bb4s,t1_fc57403,1577451992.0,Not after telling her to go fuck herself after declining. She doesn't have to be a conduit for him if she's not comfortable with it
AmItheAsshole,fc5b55h,t1_fc5557r,1577451808.0,In some of the comments she said rent was cheap and she's on a student budget
creepyPMs,fc4gb5f,t1_fc4bar2,1577415821.0,I think the thought is more big boobs=more milk and wider hips=easier childbirth
ArtCrit,fbxfzah,t1_fbxbngm,1577185458.0,On the original post she comments about being inspired by him! And also her Instagram handle is in the comments too
