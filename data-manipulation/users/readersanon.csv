Places where they can sleep, take a shower, get help applying for jobs, some places provide clothes for interviews, haircuts, food, and more. But some people prefer to not make the effort, which I refuse to reward. If I'm going to donate, it will and always has been to these charitable organizations."

weddingshaming,ff2eb7z,t1_ff16nkc,1579502607.0,"4 years in advance was just to get a general idea of if it would be feasible, if there would be more than 5 people who would go. She had a general timeframe of when it might be and approximate cost. Kind of like a heads up that it was coming up so if people wanted to go they could start saving up for it. 

Of course there were some people who couldn't make it who were initially in favour because of financial/family reasons that had come up in that time. My sister didn't harass anyone who couldn't make it though. 

Most people were happy about the heads up. Some complained about her having a destination wedding because of the cost to go, but hey you can't make everyone happy."

My favourite time with him is mornings. I'm often the last one up so he comes to cuddle with me. He'll be curled up near my feet until I ask him if it's time to get up. Then he crawls his way around so he is completely stretched out next to me with his head next to mine. Then I just use him as a pillow until I actually want to get up.

Last year I had a co-worker whose birthday was the day before mine and we both had our birthdays off which was awesome. She texts me on my birthday saying she's sick and if I can replace her. I was like no way. You got your birthday off and partied too much, that's not a reason to ruin my birthday. It's my turn to celebrate. 

I found out later another co-worker gave her shit for asking me to replace her for the same reason. It's nice to have other coworkers who got your back. 

We were liked she just turned 18(Canada), for sure she's hungover and that's why she didn't want to come in."

I just started ignoring texts from certain coworkers altogether when I wasn't scheduled to come in. 

When I was available and/or could use the extra hours I didn't mind helping out, but when it was happening every week or even several times a week, it was too much. It also depended on the co-worker. If they never call out and suddenly they need a shift covered, yeah no problem. If they always needed their shift covered and never covered anyone else's, not giving up my day off for them."

Yes, these things are bad, but there is also a lot of good in the world that people do not get to see because they are so focused on the negative.

I prefer fantasy/magic books over other genres, I will also read Science fiction, regular fiction, romance, crime, mystery, horror. But fantasy is my real reading passion and what about 75% of my book collection is comprised of. 

My reading habits mostly depend on my mood and what I feel like reading at a given moment. If I am starting a series then I will most likely binge-read that series before starting something else and then be really sad when I am finished and not want to read for a few days. If I have been reading epic fantasy novels. I will often switch over to crime or mystery so as to return to the ""real"" world for a little while to help get my head out of the clouds. 

As soon as a book is on my shelves, I consider it part of my collection. I feel more attached to the books I have read of course, but I know that the unread books will eventually be read also. They are just waiting for the right moment to be picked up. Sometimes rereading a book can be more comforting than starting a new one; you know what to expect, the characters are familiar as is the landscape.

She did a blunt cut, slightly longer than shoulder length, and barely layered it.

I went to an English school even though I was born and raised in Quebec.

The province is surrounded by English speaking provinces and borders the US. English is the universal language, they are only limiting themselves. That said, I have sees the same thing in France. I work translating documents from French to English and the company I am working for has very few people who understand any English at all.
