politics,fgu0d5v,t1_fgtud2z,1581111705.0,"A Hill-HarrisX survey literally released a year ago found that only 1 in ten Americans wanted the equivalent of a M4A situation. In that same survey 13 percent said they wanted a system like you're talking about where everyone is in the same system. The most popular option, at 32 percent, consisted of a universal, government-operated system that also would allow people to buy private, supplemental insurance. So literally Pete's plan was the most popular plan. 

I really don't understand this idea of democracy. It seems like Progressives really want democracy to win as long as its THEIR form of democracy. I saw so many ""Iowa doesn't matter"" and ""who cares about Iowa"" when Bernie wasn't ""winning"". Then after it comes out he tied or won Iowa depending on the metrics you're using then all of the sudden the front page at the very top was an article saying ""Iowa proves socialism works"" or something of that nature. 

Its the same thing with that. The majority of the people WANT an private option yet the progressive party is saying ""no no it doesn't matter that the majority want this its not good"". Me personally I'd rather support the candidate that represents what the majority of the country wants and best I can tell thats Pete's healthcare option. 

The fact that people are so against people having private insurance is insane to me. Its my choice. If public insurance is as good or better and cheaper then I'll go with that option. If its not better or cheaper or if my doctor isn't a part of it then I'll stick to the best option for me.

You don't need everyone on public you need a public insurance plan thats as good or better than private insurance. I see absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to keep my private insurance. Then again I don't back M4A, I back the public option like Pete has planned. I want the CHOICE. I hate this idea of all this government mandated shit, the less government involved in my life the better and now with my healthcare? Yeah fuck that I don't support M4A but I also know its got zero chance of passing congress even if the Democrats are in control there won't be enough support even in a blue senate for M4A. 

That being said I'm not here to talk about who's got the better plan. The point is that someone said that Pete was for the status quo. Thats disinformation and propaganda at BEST. 15 dollar minimum wage, student debt relief, a public health option, free college, marijuana legalization, these are NOT the status quo and anyone saying that Pete is a republican or that he's the status quo is full of shit.

If someone asked you ""what is the message on MMLP"" you wouldn't say ""idk it doesn't really have one most of his stuff is like this"". For better or worse MOST Eminem albums have a pretty clear message that dominates the album. How are you gonna say that most of his stuff doesn't? 

I've said a million times now and I guess you're just refusing to acknowledge this. The disses, the reply to the critics, the mentioning of Revival, virtually every song on this album references Kamikaze in some way. I guess thats why he's gotta go slow for the speds though.

Go listen to MMLP, TES, Relapse, Recovery, Revival and Kamikaze and tell me again how his albums don't usually have one major over arching theme/message."
Eminem,fgsy4i7,t1_fgsxdd9,1581095066.0,"Maybe you won't agree but if people are going to call Relapse ""SSLP2"" and if people call Recovery ""TES2"" and things of that nature it wouldn't be crazy to call this ""Kamikaze 2"". I always took away from those as he covers a lot of the same subjects, the themes are similar, etc.

I thought Kamikaze should have been a mix tape ala Da Drought 3. He take a lot of modern concepts on that album and makes fun of them and then reworks them to sound hot. Wayne would do similar stuff on this mixtape series where he'd basically just remake radio hits and make them actually sound hot. 

I prefer this album to Kamikaze, I think his Jamar response is way better, I think the way he handles MGK on this one is way better because I don't think MGK was ever worth an entire verse or basically an entire verse. Send some shots and go on about your day. I think his Tyler response is a lot more measured. 

Anyway I agree that nothing new was really said outside of stuff like Darkness and the stuff about his dad but overall its a lot of the same themes as the last album just a lot more mature and well thought out in my opinion."

I have asked you so many times at this point and you can't seem to come up with an answer. What new message is being said on this album? What makes it different than Kamikaze? If we agree he's dissing the same people, he's dissing the critics, he's still saying everyone was too stupid to get Revival. If he's still saying all of that (all shit he said on Kamikaze) what makes it DIFFERENT. We all know what the message of Kamikaze was.

Eminem,fgswa72,t1_fgsvaro,1581093976.0,"I agree with what you're saying and I think if people are going to call Relapse SSLP2 then this is certainly ""Kamikaze 2"". 

He covers a ton of the same points in this album that he covered on Kamikaze and the new points are points where he's responding TO Kamikaze like Tyler and the Rolling Stones review. 

I agree with your opinion actually and we're mostly saying the same thing. 

So let me ask you since I even agree with your Leaving Heaven opinion. What NEW message is on the album? What is the message of the album? What new ground is being broke/said on this album in your opinion? Because honestly its a lot of rehashing in my opinion. Its actually better than Kamikaze because he's not as angry in saying it and its better than Kamiakze because Kamikaze was in a lot of ways him taking what was popular (gucci gang) and making it actually good. This album was better than Kamikaze and its easily his best album in 15 years. But what new stuff is said on this album?"
Eminem,fgsvht5,t1_fgstqjs,1581093510.0,"So let me ask you. On Kamikaze he's upset because people trashed him and even he's upset that they trashed Revival. He mentions multiple times on Kamikaze how he thinks Revival was a good album that people didn't understand. On his new album he's once again talking about how he thinks Revival is a good album that people wanted until they got it and then they were to stupid to get it. I'm sure we can both list a half dozen Revival references on MTBMB easily. So thats similar. 

Next he's continuing his feuds with everyone he feuded with on Kamikaze. MGK gets some shots, Joe gets some shots, Jamar gets some shots, the critics get some shots, he mentioned Tyler again to apologize or atleast say maybe he went too hard on him. He does all of this on Kamikaze. 

So let me ask you what makes MTBMB DIFFERENT than Kamikaze. Even his super sonic flow is on this album all over the place just like it was on Kamikaze. 

What makes this album nothing like Kamikaze? What is different about this album? What is the message of this album? What makes it different than the message on Kamikaze?"

politics,fgsjgi1,t1_fgsin91,1581085877.0,"I mean maybe you could argue its going to replace the Democratic party but the Republican party is something like 95 percent behind Trump. Most Republicans that still consider themselves Republicans are in absolute love with their party. 

The ""never Trumpers"" or moderate Republicans aren't going to fit in with the Democrats who have had a CLEAR shift to the left. Virtually every front runner supports student debt relief, supports some kind of free college, minimum wage increase, most support the legalization of marijuana, simply put if a Democrat gets in office even Biden their policies would be some of the most progressive in damn near a century. 

There isn't enough moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans to form some third party that would make either party obsolete so at worst its a third party and it would almost surely drain from the Democrats since the Republicans are loyal to a fault and always are in lock step. Thus the whole ""Fall in line, fall in live"" adage. 

I'd also argue neither party is dying. Both have had radical changes in the last five years. Both parties have pushed farther to their respective sides and away from the middle, even so called moderates like Biden would be more progressive than a Clinton or even Obama. Both parties have just undergone a huge change. It seems like the Republicans are ok with this change with something like 95 percent supporting Trump. The only question mark is on the Democrat side. Will the Neoliberals, the disciples of Clinton so to speak will they show up to support the left side of the party? If they don't are there enough young people engaged to cancel them out?

When Pete was winning big it was ""its just Iowa"" and people were saying ""they don't represent the country"" these were two of if not the two most popular talking points. Now all of the sudden Iowa proves socialism can win? It'll prove socialism can win if he wins, if he beats Trump it proves socialism can win, if Trump squashes him on election day it proves otherwise. I'm not a Trump guy by any stretch of the imagination but these pieces feel more like talking something into existence. Iowa went from being the proving ground to the election, to meaning nothing, to proving something all within like a week thats crazy."

1. Make sure you're registered to vote, check it weekly it takes thirty seconds to check.
2. VOTE REPUBLICANS out. I'm not just talking out of the White House if you live in Kentucky, Florida, LA, NYC I don't care where you live vote these fucks out from the local dog catcher to the orange goblin in the White House. 
3. If you see someone saying if their candidate don't win they are voting for Trump they are a Russian troll or should be treated as such. I don't care if its mentioning Biden, Pete, Sanders, Warren, whoever they are here to divide us, do not fall into that trap. 

Full disclosure I'm not a Sanders supporter I really never have been but I promise you that if he gets the nomination I will be the first person in line to vote for him with a smile on my face this November."
Eminem,fgm7ngr,t3_ez3qw4,1580919503.0,"The reason if sounds that way is because its more laid back, his flow is more relaxed, the beat isn't at the forefront of the song, he's not cramming a ton of syllables into it or rapping really fast. I'm not saying all of those things are bad but its the biggest difference between his old and new style. The Fly as your zipper line is still pretty weak I've heard it a ton before but other than that its my favorite song on the album."

politics,fgm1eqx,t1_fgltlri,1580915973.0,"So I don't have time for a full response but I wanted to laugh at the notion of you're seemingly a Sanders supporter (nothing wrong with that) and you're having a discussion about how Sanders supporters aren't that bad. 

Then you go on to say ""Is Pete a cheat?"" And then you admit that you have no evidence that he DID cheat, and there is no evidence of him cheating other than online rumors that were mostly dispelled the other night. But instead of saying ""yeah there is no evidence he's a cheat"" you go with ""there is no evidence he's NOT a cheat"". And you're saying all of this with a straight face while telling me Sanders supporters aren't crazy. 

I'm not going to say Sanders supporters are worse than others because I've been to Biden's sub reddit and seen dumb shit too. However Sanders preaching this message of unity, and bonding, and peace, and being better, and working to a future for everyone. While his supporters say that people in the race have dementia (Biden) or that they are Republicans (Warren), or that they are cheats (Pete) and on and on and on. Even you are like ""did he cheat? I don't know but I know he MIGHT have cheated so whats so wrong with calling him a cheat"" even though your evidence for him cheating is that he's connected to Wall Street and they cheat everyone.

Meanwhile Bernie's wife took a golden parachute payout while she fucked her former employer and I don't here you talking about how she cheated the school, or that Bernie stood by here while she did it. Or how Bernie Sanders stood around while people chanted ""death to Yankee's"" in the 80's and when he was asked if they were saying that he refused to say one way or another and when asked what he would have done if he HEARD them saying that he refused to answer and his only reply was ""they were in a war with the US"". So the wannabe President of the United States refuses to say if he stood around while people chanted essentially death to the US and his reasoning on why that would be ok is that they were in a war with the US and we had a bad President. Sorry but that doesn't work for me. It also doesn't work for me that the guy never had a steady paycheck until he was in his 40's forcing his family to live on welfare because he refused to get a job that would afford them even a poverty level lifestyle. That to me sounds like just as shady of a person as Pete and his so called Wallstreet money. All in all though I believe Sanders wants whats best for the country and I believe Pete and Warren and even Bete and Booker when they were trying to win the thing wanted whats best. But for some reason when this stuff is brought up about Bernie and his less than stellar moments its all either here say, bullshit, fake news or somehow ok."
politics,fgm0m4v,t1_fgluzst,1580915457.0,"The dude was given no chance. This is like a 16 seed winning a big round in March Madness. Of course they are going to be the story over the number 1 seed. Pete shouldn't be here, Bernie is expected to be here, he's the front runner (outside of Biden who is or was or who knows anymore) but Pete? That dude came out of nowhere to either tie or beat Bernie freaking Sanders in Iowa a state Bernie lost by less than a percentage point last year, a guy that EVERYONE knows. People are mad and underselling how huge of a deal this is. This could entirely shift the entire race. Maybe it will, maybe it won't but the fact that Pete won Iowa or tied Iowa is something NO ONE on here called. 

I find it interesting that last year he entered the race and everyone laughed at him, literally laughed it was a race with Booker and Warren and Sanders and Biden. He starts doing well in the polls and I see a lot of Bernie supporters saying ""good for him, he speaks all these languages, he's a veteran, he's a christian, he seems to be an honest guy"". Lot of praise from everyone on Reddit for him. 

Then sometime late last year I'm not sure when it took a turn and they turned on him just like they turned on Warren and just like they turned on Harris two other people they really supported at one time. oh and remember Bete? This place loved that guy, then he was Centrist trash the minute he tried to win the election. 

Even when polls showed Biden surging in national polls or any good news for Biden was downvoted out of the front page, meanwhile Bernie stories about similar topics are being given gold and heavily upvoted. 

This place riots if you say anything but Bernie Sanders is the lord and savior of the world and it gets tiresome. I like Bernie a LOT more than I like his supporters."
