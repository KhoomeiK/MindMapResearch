Gamingcirclejerk,fe3km7k,t1_fduap2f,1578850166.0,what
offmychest,fe2ryvx,t1_fe2le50,1578842248.0,Still no reason to assume they’ll all do it
offmychest,fddq9jq,t3_ekmlbr,1578321082.0,"Well they're almost certainly going to fail, so it might be to the democrats's benefit for everyone to forget it."
SubredditDrama,fckii5i,t1_fck6qta,1577726075.0,I like your username
CharacterRant,fbz8oqm,t1_fbi0se3,1577238571.0,Or more accurately the trauma convinced you to form a gank squad in the forest and do mean emotes after 4v1ing some invader with a lore name
