AskReddit,ffk16oh,t1_ffilj0d,1580012662.0,"So perfectly put. I ""accidentally"" did acid last summer and it took me months to even be ok with recollecting that night. I never felt so scared and lost in my whole life. Funny thing is after the fact I had a small desire to try it again but in an isolated, therapeutic environment, not at a festival.


 The acid came on like a sneaker wave. I was fine one second and the next I was confined to my car losing my mind. There was a brief moment of euphoria; I remember skipping and running through lights on the ground and the whole world was inverted into a sphere from my perspective. But after that it was a nightmare. I remember thinking i fried my brain and would never be the same. And the next day, as my friend was driving us home, I had a constant feel of the call of the void to unbuckle my seat belt and jump out of the car on the highway. I had to hold onto my seat and stare inwards to keep those feelings and thoughts away. 

 I'll never do it again unless it's regulated and given medicinally by a psychiatrist. And even then... Oof .. lsd is too much for me."

funny,ffep66p,t3_et0f5e,1579858433.0,I'd buy the shit out of this. The world forces me to wear socks and I hate them with a passion. I'd love to have this in a mud room.

No loving parent would subject their child to that type of life and scrutiny. You couldn't pay me anything to sell my child like that. 

This is tragic. I can't believe I didn't know about this until tonight. I thought it was an isolated moment in her life when she lost her boys and she got better and gained custody back. Holy shit is this fucked up."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffeknit,t1_ffdxskb,1579852030.0,Taken a turn? Idk man. I think you're not looking at this from a perspective of a hurt person. *Able to function* is a weird way to phrase that as well

UnresolvedMysteries,ffekhm4,t1_ffd2aj2,1579851817.0,"I just feel like if her mental health was first priority, then she wouldn't be doing mentally taxing (even for stable minded performers) emotionally taxing, physically taxing shows for years. She would be reclused and doing major self work. Not showcasing in Vegas. Britney Spears is definitely the victim here. Her dad doesn't give a fuck imo. This is some Shirley temple shit. She possibly has a mental illness because of her traumatic childhood and upbringing. Poor thing was forced to perform since she was 8 years old. Consistently. It never stopped once it began. Financial/fame Goal minded parents like her's aren't to be comended, they're to be shamed. Children aren't paychecks.  


 And also..


How many people under an underpass can put on nightly shows in fucking Vegas and can still be profiled as unstable to the point of choosing the crevice of a bridge as their home? Makes no sense."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffejitz,t1_ffdemn1,1579850603.0,She's dead because she doesn't have her children and is possibly over medicated. Just my two cents. A mother without her children is dead in her soul.
UnresolvedMysteries,ffejc6w,t1_ffdryln,1579850379.0,I see that now. It's disgusting.
UnresolvedMysteries,ffej6cg,t1_ffcx8qu,1579850179.0,"I'm just going to say this... Britney Spears wouldn't be mentally unstable (if she is) if it weren't for her mom and dad forcing fame, stress, work, pressure etc. On a child. She just posted on ig she has been working non stop since 8 years old. She was fucked from the get go. Her dad *may* be trying to help now, (probably not) but he's only cleaning up the mess he made. Children are to be protected not manipulated, abused and used for profit. Britney Spears never had a chance at a normal life, therefore a normal mentality. This falls solely on her parents, her caretakers."

I wrote out a huge comment and realized that it sounded way too twacked. So I deleted it
 Your comment is the rationale response I was looking for. But fuck, man I miss the old days when shit like this would pop off you would just go over to their house and handle it. No police reports, no school board shit, no hemming and hawing. No. You talk to the parent face to face and make sure there will be an apology and if it ever happens again there will be physical repercussions between parents. 

I'd snap. No way in hell would someone hurt my child and get.away with it. Ugh fuck."

DadReflexes,ff8akvr,t1_ff67tk9,1579670994.0,"I can relate to this so much. Short fused mother translated to me having anger issues and impatience in general as well as with my children. But...

 I *almost* always remember to apologise to them, even if it's just a change in my tone that is negative or rude. Sometimes when it's a really rough day and I'm just being a totally insensitive bitch and short with them I'll explain that I'm having a bad day and it's not ok for mommy to be rude and I need some time alone.


 I've noticed they are growing up happy, loved and full of humor despite my short comings. Earlier my little one broke a plate as she was trying to scrape her left overs in the trash. She looked at me scared because of the sound and the mess (and probably wondering if I was going to get mad at her) but I instantly picked her up and asked her if she was ok and not to worry about it. She just hugged me and all was well. That's definitely not how my mother would have reacted; moments like that make me feel like I'm not the worst parent in the world. My biggest fear as a parent is that I will instill the anger and anxiety in them that my mother gave me."

By not doing anything to protect him from his abusive mother you are just as much at fault. Child endangerment by subjecting him to a dangerous environment is more than enough for your child to be taken away from you. Nip this in the bud."

I even gave him a shitted wtf look and tried to move out of the way and then he pointed towards me again. Coincidentally as soon as my shooting buddy came out he pointed it towards the ground and then put in the display case. I was so livid I actually called his manager as soon as I left and asked him to review the cameras and scold that little fucker for pointing a god damn gun anywhere but towards the ground. Dip shit dumb ass shouldn't even be working for a gun range let alone holding a gun. Ffs
