Dacă mai mulți duzi au dat Like celor două dude, sunt și mai mari șansele ca și ție să îți placă a doua dudă, așa că Tinder decide să ți-o arate și ție.

E Machine Learning destul de simplu. Nu știu dacă Tinder se bazează doar pe corelația asta sau se mai uită și la alte chestii.

Nu știu dacă au ajuns la nivelul cu AI pentru poze, asta chiar e supoziție.

Otherwise, you would spend a lot of time in the air, flying from one side of Europe to the other.

One of the great things about solo traveling is that you don't have to match your schedule to that of other people.  
So I don't know how flexible are your plans, but I would start in a city, then go to the next one that is easy to get to.  
From your list, I would start in Tallinn, then go south to the other Baltic cities.  
Then Poland, Czechia, Slovakia. Bulgaria+Romania and Croatia+Slovenia can be done in any order. Finally, take a flight to Ireland or Portugal, then to the other.

I don't know what you like, so it's probably not the same things I do. I am more interested in history. 

If I were to start from Egypt, I would first fly to Greece, where I would visit Athens and Mount Olympus (I don't know if and how it can be visited, though, I haven't researched it).

Then, I would get a bus or train to Bulgaria, where I would start with Sofia, Plovdiv, and Veliko Tărnovo. If I had the time, the old town of Nessebar is on my list.

Then, in Romania, people seem to like Bucharest. There's what I call a tourist path, that every vlogger seems to take in this country: From Bucharest they go to Brașov, the Bran Castle (tourist trap for people who hear it has something to do with Dracula), then they visit some other parts of Transylvania (Sighișoara, Sibiu, Cluj, Oradea).

I also liked the North-Eastern part of Romania, which sees fewer international tourists.

From Romania, plane tickets from Bucharest and Cluj are very cheap to some popular destinations in Europe.

If I were to continue with busses and trains, I would go to Hungary. Budapest is nice enough. I don't know much about the rest.

From there, I would either head towards Italy, stopping in Zagreb and/or Ljubljana if I had the time. 

In Italy, I would maybe visit Venice and Milan, before I go check out that Matterhorn mountain you want to see.
