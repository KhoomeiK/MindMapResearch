Can’t tell from photo.   But it is not in the cargo hold so I think it is probably a support or service dog.."
aww,ffhb7qz,t1_ffh7j7i,1579928591.0,"I know someone who has a support animal. The person I know has autism and although she is very high functioning, she struggles deeply to initiate conversations.  She can respond to people but the first move or words are hard so her small support dog greatly assists her.  Many people will ask if they can pat the dog or what is the name of her dog or say what a lovely dog, etc..  so the dog acts as an icebreaker. 

The dog also calms her anxiety- scientific studies have shown that just patting an animal decreases the patter’s stress levels. The dog also minimises her egocentric behaviour, not egotistical but egocentric as in concentrating on one’s self... she has another being dependent on her... 


So yep, support animals might be sometimes used as an excuse to own a pet - but it definitely helps the person I know"

SkincareAddiction,ffdgzan,t1_ffcw777,1579820659.0,"No, I think repurpose and reuse are different things or can be... for example you buy shopping bags that can be reused as opposed to the “mostly” single use plastic shopping bags although they can be reused again, not just once.  But they will be reused as bags... 

Whereas say an old cupboard door can be repurposed as a coffee table top or a cubby house door or something else.  Yes, it is being reused but for a different purpose.  Jam jars become nut jars or vases.  

I also think refuse is similar to reduce but again slight differences, if one fruit shop insists on excessive plastic and another doesn’t, you refuse to shop at the one that does and go to the one that doesn’t.  Similarly with say cosmetics, you refuse excessive packaging and choose something else.  

So yes, while similar, I think there are subtle differences"

 I think it is the luck of the draw... my first second hand SAAB was a dream car,  my second was a tragic story 

Also never let petrol get below 1/4 tank


Ps... I end up selling my last SAAB because the electric components kept failing and these are things that can’t be tested for at vehicle inspection time... things like the electric window regulator and the gear regulator...  ignition barrel got loose... 

These were all relatively minor things (well maybe not the gear regulator) but they cost $$ to repair as there is usually only aa few parts suppliers and he knows that SAAB owners will pay as they love their cars 

I still miss mine but I sure don’t miss the bills..  

I think you have to think of the car as an hobby, you might be lucky and get a brilliant one like my first one or you get a problem child like my second one.

Would I buy both of them again, probably... but I would have definitely got rid of the second one sooner than I did..."

So why sell?  The electric components...  one window regulator went $400... yep, 2nd one about a month later, then 6 weeks later the 3rd...  the 4th was still ok.  

Then the fuel injector system failed $700

But the main decision to sell was caused by a very small $90 including labour part....  the gear regulator... failed while I was away from my home town and it was over the holiday season so I was stuck in a town that I didn’t know and I had to pay three weeks extra accommodation until the mechanic who serviced SAABs was back from his holiday and for the part to be ordered in and installed. 

I couldn’t drive the car as without this gear regulator part (automatic car) - the car might suddenly go into limp mode and slow down to 40km/h and on highway roads  with 100 km/h  - not a good thing to happen...

The part was installed but as much as I love SAAB - I just couldn’t rely on it anymore.  My first one had been a dream car and drove until 250K until head casket blew.   This second one only had 137K on the clock.  Guess GM owned it at that time and they started to cut corners...

Even just the small fish that look like gold fish were $90!  And there were much more expensive fish in the tank.  They also had names so the owner was emotionally attached to the fish... The cleaning is a tricky process as the fish (well in the case I saw)  stay in the tank so the cleaner had to make sure that the pH and the level of oxygen, etc all stayed at levels for the fish to stay alive.   He also educated clients on the correct amount to feed their fish.  He said too many people over feed.  I had heard this before but never understood why it was bad.  It is not that the fish get fat and get coronary heart diseases.  It is because the uneaten food sinks to the bottom of the tank and festers creating harmful bacteria...
