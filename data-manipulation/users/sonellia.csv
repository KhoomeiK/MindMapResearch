AskReddit,ffv00j0,t3_ev5zdg,1580252616.0,Almost ran over two dogs driving on my way home from work today. They ran so fast across the intersection all I could do was slam my brakes(luckily there was no one behind me) Thankfully I didn’t hit them but man I was sick to my stomach I just cried. All I could think of was what would have happened if that was my dog in the middle of the road.
entitledparents,fftmubu,t3_ev1c3k,1580224549.0,"I’ve had something much less extreme happen but along the lines of “how much for your dog, money isn’t an issue” and I just laughed and said he’s worth more then all my money in the world to me."
harrypotter,ffoxgoj,t1_ffn265u,1580083019.0,They really did an amazing job casting kids that were so like their characters.
Frugal,ffnynqs,t1_ffne5lj,1580072342.0,Maybe I should try it with ice. I’ve always wanted to like it but it tasted meh to me for the high price.
Frugal,ffnykep,t1_ffm0ddg,1580072300.0,My closes Asian store is a 5 minute drive and shit was life changing. Everything was pretty affordable and they had soo many awesome things I’d never seen or tried before. Highly recommend.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffnxln9,t1_ffmjkhj,1580072059.0,Exactly. I’m shocked that all the McDonald’s cheeseburgers haven’t don’t him in yet. One can only hope.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,ffnwyng,t1_ffnebux,1580071814.0,"This saves my ass as a nanny. Nothing gets a kid to stop crying faster then “hey, why don’t you go pick any game and we’ll play it together!” But to be fair my kiddo was 4 and he really didn’t have as many tantrums and that age anymore. He also looooves board games and we have probably 25 in the house so it’s always a fun time."
starterpacks,ffnwaxk,t3_eu5hkx,1580071564.0,This is pretty much my mom. English is her 3rd language and she always feels like her English is bad no matter how much I try to convince her it’s better then a lot of native speakers.
sports,ffnus0z,t3_eubd51,1580071116.0,Damn I know close to nothing about sports but man did I wish this wade a fake headline. RIP Kobe.
wholesomememes,ffhl5by,t1_ffhl326,1579940407.0,"That’s so cute. When I get ready for work he looks at me and wags his tail, waiting for me to give him a good morning kiss and tuck him in. He’s my lazy cuddle bug and I love him to bits."
