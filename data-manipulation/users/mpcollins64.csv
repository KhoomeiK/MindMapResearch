I once was hunting for a Japanese yarn to make a kimono sweater.  I did a search and found one reference, and it so happened that the other person was making the same sweater lol."

bipolar,fe57s91,t1_fdzt1n2,1578866353.0,"I understand that mania crops up a lot in the summer.   I know someone that I believe goes through it; this summer was a doozy.  My late boyfriend would say that I would hit the 'September slump',  With this knowledge, I'm figuring that I hit one in the summer and by fall was coming out of it. He met me in the summer, probably during one, and I'm hypomanic most other times, so he was probably used to me being fast, not slow."
