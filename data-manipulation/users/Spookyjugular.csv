Gameboy,ff3tqsf,t3_eri5t2,1579548660.0,It’s either a trick of the angle they are at or one of them is fake the Nintendo seal is different on them. I recommend you invest in a tri wing for cheap for buying Gameboy games

He started the article with a story from his 20s and then tells us this is a story best told chronologically. Then why aren’t you telling it chronologically who is writing the story the best way. I want to read their version."
personalfinance,fefc1vt,t1_fedya56,1579053040.0,Also look at you bank statements now because 400 pounds plus 7 days notice with any sort of vacation payback is going to be noticeable on your banking statement
gaming,fdv1uag,t1_fduwf37,1578742210.0,Yeah but you can’t buy them on steam. I know the switch has 3rd party games but 1st party games are what people love Nintendo for
TwoXChromosomes,fduzz4y,t1_fduzic8,1578741461.0,When you project your emotions into the struggles of others it’s called empathy
TwoXChromosomes,fdutfny,t1_fdusqs4,1578738550.0,Thank you for your valuable well though out response. We disagree and the way life is structured has taught you to ignore people who disagree with you. I don’t think anything I said was particularly negative towards anything or unworthy of listening to. It’s up to you to decide if you want to challenge your own thoughts or block out things that you don’t agree with.
TwoXChromosomes,fdush8z,t1_fduqabk,1578738108.0,"I have no control over you and what you do you and don’t pretend to you are just being a hypocrite. I am not coming in here using stereotypes and I am allowed to be here. I am just here giving my opinion and that is that you calling someone a fuckboi for being unhappy is the same as a man calling you emotional for having a strong opinion, they are both wrong. Men can be sad, they can also be poor partners but everyone is an individual."
TwoXChromosomes,fdupg19,t1_fduosn6,1578736787.0,If you stereotype men then you can’t criticize men for stereotyping you without being a hypocrite. So you can apply negative stereotypes to others if you like but then you are just supporting a culture of ignorance.
TwoXChromosomes,fduaed1,t1_fdu8nc4,1578730344.0,Nowhere I just relate my own experience of feeling of being unsure I can be happy with depression which can clinical or seasonal
TwoXChromosomes,fdu78gx,t1_fdu11ea,1578728802.0,As someone who has struggled with depression I think this is a really callus response to the idea that someone is not sure how to be happy in 2020. This guy isn’t cheating or abusive he is unhappy a lot of men and women are unhappy and acting like he’s just is trying to trick her into fixing things isn’t helpful.

personalfinance,fds4oxh,t1_fdqkagf,1578694287.0,Yeah but she doesn’t seem like a person who is correctly using a credit card so she should pay it off as soon as possible and cut it up
facepalm,fdqa287,t1_fdo98yl,1578660764.0,Are you stupid or something that month doesn’t exist. God I wish idiots like you would just remind everyone about the 0th of February
MadeMeSmile,fdmhmfw,t1_fdmd8s9,1578550206.0,He also appears to believe in god and his belief may very well have led him to take these actions. So even if we knew 100 percent guaranteed that the god he believes did not exist he still played a role in doing this good without even existing. So maybe just do some good yourself and take all the credit if the guy who did this doesn’t want it that’s his prerogative.
leagueoflegends,fdmh2h9,t1_fdle2uo,1578549660.0,Raising the difficulty for dealing damage tends to add the ability to perform well on a champion by playing them correctly. IMO this was already the correct combo and you were rewarded for doing it by landing the second damage from Q they are just making it less rewarding to play less optimally

todayilearned,fd8rux0,t1_fd8rgfs,1578222518.0,I’m not saying the pizza is worth any less I’m saying they are not actually paying $3.50 to anyone except maybe other companies owned by the same people sell them their ingredients for that.
aww,fd8mlhu,t3_ek8jkb,1578220273.0,Those big paws spell trouble. I’m sure they have a good boy/girl on their hands but those are I’m going to be bigger than I think I am paws
todayilearned,fd8m178,t1_fd7z9lm,1578219995.0,Yes let’s be clear here pizza is flour tomato cheese those are some of the cheapest ingredients in the US. I could make pizza with pre maid items for 3:50 and that includes the grocery store’s profit and labor overhead on top of the suppliers who make process it on top of the original profits of the farmers who produce the raw materials.  Little cesars makes their own dough and sauce and maybe even cheese these numbers are lies or creative accounting.
Cloud9,fcyx5v7,t1_fcstdpj,1578089032.0,A lot of people are recommending but i would say it’s a bad idea to buy a chair without sitting in it first. If for any reason it doesn’t fit you well you have an expensive back pain generator

leagueoflegends,fcld5dm,t1_fclcwqj,1577745054.0,Yeah the chest system is not design to give you cool things it’s there to get you to spend money on keys when you have a ton of boxes
leagueoflegends,fclco55,t1_fclck4l,1577744750.0,It means you didn’t progress far into the honor system or you didn’t use event tokens on key frags. I would be at 30+ if I didn’t use tokens for keys first
leagueoflegends,fclcesw,t1_fcdyzw3,1577744583.0,This is not accurate there are a lot of things that knock people up and then stun but there are also things that knock up for the entire length of the CC Malph ult for example

personalfinance,fcl7nyq,t1_fcl2njf,1577741582.0,You need to file for estranged status before you apply for the FAFSA next year otherwise your Guardians income will count against you when apply for financial aid.
leagueoflegends,fcjlsrw,t1_fcjehgf,1577692950.0,To put some math into top 500 in DOTA vs league DOTA has about 11 million monthly users and league had 100 million in 2017(all quick research may be slightly inaccurate) so if league has grown at all over the last couple years we are looking at conservatively 10 times more players making him go from top 500 to top 5000 if he were in the same percentile of LOL. Add in most top league players have played for a long time and you will be learning champs the map items macro and the differing mechanics of the game it’s a lot. Over 12 months I would say 50/50 knowing nothing about you over 1 if you are insane you might get D2. There is just too much time involved if you ever lose momentum climbing you can’t make it. Only playing to climb and spamming games will just fuck your mental when someone ints or AFKs as well

buildapcsales,fcb6m8e,t1_fca5gfl,1577583035.0,Yeah you can count on that port failing after 6 months and then if you buy a new cable it might work for a month or 2
buildapcsales,fcb5paq,t1_fcb0ki5,1577582695.0,Free sync is often around 40 -60 range or similar smaller windows g sync with a module cover a much wider range
gaming,fc9ltnr,t1_fc9iymk,1577554600.0,There was a huge amount of advertising around control and a descent amount of coverage from people who talk about games. The reason this game doesn’t have sales like tomb raider is because it isn’t a game like tomb raider it’s a game based around some gameplay ideas that is like 10 to 15 hours long. Tomb raider is a popular series of games that has expansive gameplay.
todayilearned,fc9g6x1,t1_fc9dtqg,1577552207.0,"But that’s just a more inflammatory way of saying the same thing. The Wii-U to me was a huge failure on all levels except 1 it signaled a movement away from focusing on motion controlled games. I think a lot of people associate the U with its games which, while there are some greats, could have just been made for the Wii."
todayilearned,fc9fcyk,t1_fc919jb,1577551860.0,Just because the Wii U controller has a design that looks similar to a switch does t mean they are technologically similar at all a Wii U was a buffed up Wii  that used wireless technology to broadcast to a screen. The same ideas led from that to a system you can actually take portable for sure but the Wii U was a huge failure that should have never left Nintendo’s R&D in that state.

personalfinance,fc77r84,t1_fc70qe9,1577499786.0,If the s&p 500 has failed your google stock has also failed. 1 is betting on economic growth or consolidation of economic gain. The other is betting on a single company.

videos,fc6y0me,t1_fc6v8ww,1577492413.0,He didn’t he used it to say it was stupid how upset people got over his review of it and how they did 50 minute rants arguing against it.
Music,fc6wyhw,t1_fc6t56f,1577491633.0,Yes but that’s not how it works they don’t allocate per person they do it based on region separated by premium or not so if for example you live in the US and are a premium user it puts it in the pool of total plays and they calculate what percentage of total listens the band is and pay them based off that so you can look at it like part of your money goes to drake but then others peoples money goes to Blink 182 even though they don’t listen to them.
TeamSolomid,fc6wam9,t1_fc6na70,1577491144.0,Yeah people act like he was a terrible jungler because he didn’t do well in summer. He was amazing in spring particularly at the end after he and BB worked on their 2v2 synergy culminating with the reverse sweep of c9. I don’t know why people act like he let us down in summer it was completely the opposite. Parth thought it was unfair to not give Grig a chance and Akaadian didn’t really have a chance to mentally recover from it.
NintendoSwitchDeals,fc6vim2,t1_fc6hb3w,1577490575.0,If you look at this list posted above they are all either super close to another one or there are 2 or 3 I’m not 100 percent sure are near others but I would guess they are performing particularly bad.
news,fc4ynhz,t1_fc4y1sx,1577434183.0,All this comment does is reinforce thought of people who believe these a both legitimate ways to insult people and that if someone tells them they shouldn’t they are being a snowflake. This person was just putting him down in a way that a disgusting person who would do things like this would hate not attacking short people with small dicks.
politics,fc4xn5d,t1_fc4kkrg,1577432825.0,My confusion is that these republicans could have supported impeachment a long time ago after there was not enough proof of collusion to charge him with anything but obstruction and acted like he was a rotten egg. After he got removed from office Mike Pence would have become president and they could have quietly continued their racist nativist policy’s and said all the bad stuff was Trump. What they are saying instead is Yeah he did it but there isn’t anything wrong with what he did.
leagueoflegends,fc2u23t,t1_fc0jydc,1577374045.0,It’s all because people who put support second were complaining about getting their secondary role too much and so riot changed it to actually try to prioritize primary roles. I know that sounds dumb but it started happening after they made the change.
MadeMeSmile,fc2eptr,t1_fc1rmry,1577355922.0,Yeah I’m pretty sure this dog just learned some behavior that will upset their hooman in the future
