feedthebeast,fevq6q1,t3_eqlsh7,1579400158.0,"Im not a big fan of the learn by quests mods. I suggest playing ftb infinity evolved because the items are really cheap/easy to make early game compared to other packs. Thermal Expansion/Thermal Dynamic, is the easiest mod to learn in my experience. Once in a game type @ thermal no spaces in the inventory where it shows all items it will bring up specific items for those mods.

First you will probobly have to youtube to learn how those modded items work. Like the steam engine, it uses coal and an aquatic accumulator surround by water to power without blowing up. I still have alot of machines ive never even used yet and have to look them up because the machines inventory and what it needs can be confusing.

My first goal when playing is to make a couple steam engines to power a pulverizers and redstone engines. Just play as you normally would minecraft for a few hours. Gather tons of ores wood and coal. Dont smelt the ores until you create a pulverizer and redstone engine setup. (what i mean is only smelt the amount you need, pulverizer will double it.)

Then i work on moving up to magmatic engines, and pumping lava out of the nether, and teleported to the main world in a giant tank by either a tesseract or ender tank,

Third goal is to have quarrys going and a simple item duct to move the mined items into chests

after i get tons of ores i try to find other ways of power generation but if you make it this far you'll have your own goals in mind. Once you learn thermal mod series other tech mods will ""click"" with you faster."

Because one its got basically every mod youll ever need, and two Ive never made one that ran smooth and was stable, after adding more than 4 mods. But if you're set on making one I recommend these mods.

Thermal Expansion

Thermal Dynamics

Ender IO

Tinkers Construct

Industrial Craft

Thermal expansion/dynamic are like the base ""tech"" mods in my experience. And the most useful. Industrial craft is somewhat the same, just different method of obtaining power and different power outputs. Thermal expansion/dynamic is RF. Industrial Craft is EU.

If you do decide to go FTB Infinity Evolved any mod you want to use search @ modname with no space. Example: @ Thermal Dynamics or @ industrial craft. It will show every item for that mod.  

If you need any help let me know."
feedthebeast,fek4a4h,t3_el8dtu,1579192296.0,"Just go thermal expansion, and tinkers construct. It will take some hours but can be done.

The verry very first thing I do is work on getting a jetpack. Usually have it after #1

1: Get steam dynamos, and connect it to energy cell, then powering pulverizers, and the rf furnaces. Get alot of ore and pulverize it for double.

2: Tinkers construct a axe, i forget what one but it cuts down whole trees. Then work on getting a lava crystal to put on the axe. Infinite fast charcoal to power dynamos.

2 1/2: start focusing on pumping lava out of the nether to replace coal, and upgrade dynamos.

3: Quarrys powerd by dynamos = No more mining.

4: MystCraft worlds, you can make crazy worlds like 10x ore worlds, lava worlds, oil worlds, all worlds youd ever imagine, and start excavating or pumping stuff out... At this point though I find my pc starts crashing randomly from all the automation.

5: Whatever the hell you want to use all that ore on because you now are op as hell."
