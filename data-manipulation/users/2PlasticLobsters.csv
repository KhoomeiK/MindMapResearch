In general, people who have meaningful friendships have better health & more rewarding lives than people who don't. Very few people are genuinely content being alone. Since you fear missing out, I suspect you're not one of them.

This doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing, forever & always issue. You mention below that you have trauma-related issues. That alone can take a ton of emotional energy (I know firsthand). So you could consider temporarily but deliberately withdrawing. You could tell your friends that you're going through some heavy stuff & need to be on your own awhile. If they're friends worth having, they'll understand. Then you'd leave the door open to reconnect when you're in the right frame of mind.

AskWomen,fezeshu,t3_eqvpek,1579456566.0,"I was mostly dreading that I'd have to discuss something personal with my creepy mother. She got overly emotional about pretty much everything. Plus she'd get mad if everyone didn't join her in just the right way. Plus it was yet another thing she'd make about herself. 

Fortunately, she didn't have one of her blow-ups. After that was over with, everything else was anticlimactic."

minimalism,fezb95t,t3_eqrhyr,1579455618.0,"Maybe consider focusing in buying from local antique shops/thrift stores &/or local crafts people. Either way has a lower environmental impact. Plus mass production often involves overseas sweatshops, child labor, etc. 

As far as quality, maybe keep in mind that brand names don't necessarily mean high quality. A lot of the time it's just advertising that creates an ooh-aah image to some people."

Also, at some point a certain hobby will turn out to be not up your alley, or it was but you're done with it. Be willing to admit such to yourself & move on. Don't keep a bunch of supplies, like yarn, crochet hooks & instruction booklets around for years in case you change your mind."

The two pix side-by-side with shadows at different angles make me think of optical illusions. I half-expect the punchline to be that both dogs are actually the same size."
aww,fez6hxg,t1_feysbt9,1579454296.0,"I have a weird association with it, from a time I was camping with a friend. We were relaxing & having a couple beers & roasting our hot dogs over a fire. Suddenly, from some other campsite, we heard ""TREVOR, GET OFF OF YOUR SISTER!""

It was probably innocent sibling bickery, but it creeped us out. Though not so much that we didn't laugh like maniacs."
AskWomen,fez5sjk,t3_eqy2tt,1579454060.0,"Find partners who are willing to work with you on your issues (any of them, not just anxiety). My BF's instinct is to inform me that I'm being irrational, as if I wasn't already aware of that. If I ever break up with him, that'll be why. 

Fortunately, my anxiety is odd & specific to a few things like cooking & driving while navigating in unfamiliar areas."

AskWomen,fesgtsw,t3_eqepgd,1579364962.0,"Looking over these posts & comments, my main suggestion is: keep trying! I see so many where the person went to one class or meetup they didn't like & just gave up. 

Opening your mind a bit would also help. I see where lots of people bailed on groups without people in their age group. Protip: You're allowed to have friends of other ages. It can be interesting to broaden your horizons. Some of my friends are in their 20s, others are in their 70s, with most other decades also represented. It's compatibility that matters.

If you've genuinely tried & still can't connect with anyone, counseling might help."

AskWomen,fesbqxk,t1_ferzzaa,1579363604.0,"You could start your own group. If you see lots of people your age around, there's probably a need for at least one. It'd probably get a good response."
AskWomen,fesb7bl,t1_fer2coo,1579363420.0,"The events usually start off in a parking lot, sometimes for a carpool. So you'd want probably want to forego the carpool in case you want to make an escape later. And you can get a feel for the group vibe while you're still in a public place. If it feels ""off"", you can suddenly develop a headache & bail gracefully.

Some groups also have social gatherings. My old outdoor club had a monthy social hour. I had misgivings before the first event I was interested in, which involved camping overnight. At the social hour, I was able to get a feel for the group & enjoyed it very much. I stayed involved for >10 years & met my partner of almost 15 years through it."
