greatdanes,ff875zl,t1_ff82xu4,1579667924.0,It's acne. It's common. My Dane always has it too because he drools and such and his face doesn't get a chance to dry properly unless I wipe it every time he eats/drinks.
aww,ff2wnzz,t3_er4u53,1579526950.0,Some people would pay money for that painting! I'd hang it on my wall!!
greatdanes,ff2wbv8,t3_er90r1,1579526614.0,So sorry to hear this. I'm dreading the day that I have to say goodbye to my goofy goober Dane. Nothing can ever prepare you.

askwomenadvice,fcwjb96,t3_eiyfu3,1578027157.0,"I am also an only child (female) who doesn't want children. It began the same way. As a teenager and in my early 20s everyone used the same fucking lines ""you'll change your mind"" or ""call me when you're 30."" Guess what? 31 now. Still don't want kids. Now everyone's attitudes have changed, as if I'm some sort of super villian. ""Why wouldn't you want kids?"" or ""you're very selfish."" My mom likes to use the line ""I'm hoping for an oops."" 

I wish people would stop. I have ZERO interest in kids. When I see pregnant stomachs, I find it disgusting. I hate kids. I don't like being around them. I find them extremely irritating. My cats and dog are like my kids enough. I already have a busy life with no time to myself. I can't imagine throwing a child in there too. I don't want to go to work all day, be exhausted, only to come home to kids to annoy the fuck out of me and drain what little energy I have left. 

Yeah, getting old will suck. I won't have anyone to help me out. I might die alone. But it is what it is.

Sorry, not sorry."

AskReddit,fcj8wqd,t1_fchtipu,1577680215.0,I only watched it here and there that I could remember as a kid. I tried to watch it now as an adult and I could barely even get through the first episode.
