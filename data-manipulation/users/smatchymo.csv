unpopularopinion,ff7w56n,t3_erx2x0,1579659779.0,"Christianity is what our country interacts with. The majority of Americans feel no impact from other religions in their day-to-day life.  People on this site bash Christianity for a couple of reasons, their mystical beliefs and Evangelical activity in politics.   The people that bash the mystical beliefs would bash Jewish mystical beliefs as well. The issue is things like the parting of the red sea are also associated with Christianity instead of Judaism, because that's what we know.   People on reddit don't know anything about the mystical beliefs of Muslim people so they can't say anything on that subject.

Yes, Islam in the Middle East can be brutal.  That is not our reality in the US. We have laws safeguarding us so that is not a primary concern to us.  The very few Muslim leaders in our country do not push their religious beliefs on their constituents. Meanwhile Christian leaders like to tell non-Christians who they can marry and what they can do with their bodies.   Christianity was once used to subjugate women. We've moved beyond that because that wasn't something inherent to Christianity. The same holds true with Islam. There can be conservative and liberal practitioners."
