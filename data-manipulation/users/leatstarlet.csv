PlasticSurgery,fez1u89,t1_fexxd3t,1579453104.0,"Yes I do realize having them removed won’t solve my body dysmorphia. I’m excited to no longer have health issues caused by them.  And by taking them out I go back to looking like myself which for a lot of women in the same boat as me, almost all the women I know who got them were insecure, had tons of body issues. Got fake breasts, had complications health wise and never liked the way the implants made them look and feel. They have said they love being natural and looking like themselves again. I’m in a full time intense coding bootcamp and so after that I will try and find a body image specific therapist to deal with these feelings about my body."

TwoXChromosomes,fdhbr5r,t1_fdh4zsl,1578419543.0,"I hope I do, I’ve heard ph balance products are bad for you as they replace your body being able to self regulate. I’ll try probiotics and talk to my gyno tho!"
bipolar,fdhbn4f,t3_ekwp8v,1578419482.0,"I think us having bipolar gives us a unique perspective on life. We are more empathetic than others, Abraham Lincoln had bipolar, Van Gogh, a lot of incredible people had bipolar. It’s not a bad thing. Taking medication is self care"

TwoXChromosomes,fdgwq9b,t1_fdgntqh,1578410214.0,"I stopped using soap to wash my vulva, now just warm water, sleep without underwear on, Pee after sex, get tested regularly. It’s really whenever I take a bath I get a yeast infection. It really sucks :("
bipolar,fdejon4,t1_fdeeifj,1578340459.0,I totally agree!
bipolar,fde2lfy,t3_ekwp8v,1578329772.0,"I am on really great meds too and I feel awesome too. It’s normal to want to escape this diagnosis, it also is normal to want to get off your meds when you’re doing well. Your meds are helping you, good meds convince us that we are healed. Whenever I get off meds on my own my life comes crashing down. I do not recommend it. There is nothing scary about bipolar or even being on meds forever. Your safety and mental health is the most important so focus on whatever helps that."
