scifi,fglo6rn,t3_eysqm7,1580906110.0,"I think they exist for different reasons though.

FTL and artifical gravity exist because it means you don't need to do as much world-building. Gravity is mundane. Short journey times are mundane. If your story isn;t about these then you don't want to dwell on it.

Dealing with a system with gravity needs no explanation except that there's some gravity device. Stairs and ladders can be used to go up and down. People can sit in chairs and place objects on tables. It's mundane stuff that needs to explanation or exposition. In zero gravity, you need to explain how *everything* works. If the captain invites someone aboard for a meal, as part of a diplomatic process, how does it actually work? Is there wine? Is it served in bags? All potentially interesting, but not if it's not the story the author wants to tell.

FTL is similar. Nearest stars are light years away. FTL travel means you can do the journey in a few months at worst, and any problems are already solved with sail-age technology. You can possibly do this with relativity or hibernation, but that limits the types of stories you can tell. If it's a one way trip, then you can do this, but if you like the idea of societies on different worlds interacting then the timescales are far too long.

I think there's an element of this to space capitalism as well. It's a system that works, so doesn't need explanation. To be honest, I rather like when this one is subverted. I like social commentary. Iain M Banks' The Culture, for example, has a post scarcity society, and that is used as a contrast to our society.

AI and colonisation are common for completely the opposite reason. They're interesting, and unusual. 

They exist because they're worth exploring. They have potential for conflict. Conflict is what we need for stories. Space capitalism does this as well, f course. This is a driving force in The Expanse."
