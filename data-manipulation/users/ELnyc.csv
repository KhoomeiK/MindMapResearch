UnresolvedMysteries,feihvs5,t1_feigbtc,1579138901.0,"I’m not sure if you’re suggesting that no one ever does anything despite believing their actions to be morally wrong or if you’re trying to make a more nuanced point, but I suppose it’s irrelevant.

I didn’t and don’t think that you’re a horrible person, nor do I think that all undocumented immigrants are saintly.  I think that, as is the case in any population, some are good, some are bad.  I also agree that using fake papers is committing fraud, at least from a legal perspective.  Where we seem to disagree on is whether it is possible to be a “good” person and an undocumented immigrant at the same time (and, by extension, whether being undocumented makes someone more likely to commit what we both seem to agree is morally wrong - falsely claiming to be a 9/11 victim).  I am fortunate enough to have been born in the U.S. and to have little true understanding of what it’s like growing up in, say, Venezuela, so I don’t feel like I have sufficient information to conclude that someone coming here to escape from that is a bad person.  You feel otherwise, and that is obviously your prerogative."
UnresolvedMysteries,feifq59,t1_feidtxj,1579137465.0,"“...while legally accurate...” 

Using fake papers to get a job is not a value judgment.  Forming an opinion as to whether doing so would be morally wrong (or right, or neutral) is a value judgment.  We have no idea whether this person, to the extent that he existed, felt that his actions were right or wrong.  

You are right that using fake papers is fraudulent and dishonest.  However, words do not exist in a vacuum.  The people who refer to undocumented immigrants as fraudulent and dishonest tend to be the people that believe that they are “bad” people (i.e., perhaps the kind of people likely to make false claims about whether they were a victim of 9/11).  People who do not believe that they are bad people are often reluctant to refer to undocumented immigrants using the same words that we use for people embezzling money, tricking senior citizens in phone scams, etc., presumably because their value judgment is that the latter category of people are bad and undocumented immigrants are not.  

You mentioned that you value facts over feelings, so you may not have any opinion as to whether using false papers makes one a bad person, but only so much nuance can be conveyed via Reddit, so people are going to assume that you do think that it does (and judge you accordingly in turn)."

Another thing that has helped me is keeping a few of my boring apps (e.g. the Financial Times, my bank account app, my email, etc.). They’re not interesting enough to really suck me in but they also keep me from getting desperate enough to go through the password reset process."
UnresolvedMysteries,feidcey,t1_feichab,1579135861.0,"I think it’s more that referring to undocumented immigrants as having a “literal history of fraud and dishonesty” is, while legally accurate, perceived as a value judgment that some would disagree with (along with being the kind of language used by people who often make more strongly worded negative statements about illegal immigration).

Genealogy,fei2a8c,t1_feg8q2p,1579128710.0,"Yeah, that definitely makes it harder.  If you haven’t tried JewishGen, it is worth checking out.   A lot of their records are on Ancestry but often not in a format that makes sense as compared to JewishGen.

Something else I’ve done when I truly can’t find anything is look at every listing on Yad Vashem for the town I’m looking for.  With a big place like Vienna, I narrow it to surnames that are close to or similar to what I’m looking for, searching both for people who actually have the last name and for people whose parents had that last name.  Sometimes I can then piece more together from the family relationships described in the documents, although I see that Feldsteins in Vienna are limited so that may be unavailing.  If you know any of their parents’ first names and are willing to do some digging, I’ve also tried searching for parents’ names with no surnames or locations to see if that turns anything up.  

Separately, if you know what town their family was from in Hungary, I’m happy to see if MACSE has records indexed that might be relevant to you to see if you might want to subscribe (it’s pretty cheap for a year’s access, just logistically challenging bc of the Hungarian).  I’m guessing you don’t know their Hungarian surname, but if you do I can check that, too.  Hungary also has a lot of great Jewish vital record compilations on FamilySearch but they take forever to go through even if you know what name and town you’re looking for.

If you know what camp(s) anyone was sent to, you can sometimes write to the camp’s museum and see if they have any relevant records.  I did it for Auschwitz and they weren’t able to turn up anything but they did get back to me in a fairly reasonable amount of time.  I also found some camp records on the USHMM website that I haven’t seen elsewhere - they let me download the person’s intake card, background info form, etc., which listed the person’s parents’ names, what camps they were in, their address back in Hungary, etc.

Finally, I sometimes have luck just from regular googling - I’ve seen older websites with people’s personal genealogies that have been helpful, results on sites like genealogyindexer, etc."

It automatically blocks safari if you have it turned on so I downloaded chrome in case of an actual emergency but it doesn’t have any of my logins saved like Safari does so it’s a lot more annoying to use to procrastinate with, especially since so many websites want you to open stuff in their apps now.

There’s also MACSE, which is a site with indexes of Hungarian vital records (mostly Budapest but gradually expanding), but you have to pay for it and in its in Hungarian so it’s not for the faint of heart.

UnresolvedMysteries,febr1zx,t3_eo5vk6,1578961729.0,"Mine is stupid compared to most of these, but it’s probably the most viscerally scared I’ve ever felt so it always comes to mind in these posts.  

In college I lived alone in an apartment building off campus.  I never locked my apartment door because I was young and an idiot.  One night I’m laying in bed at like 2 AM and I hear a noise outside of my door, like someone jiggling the doorknob maybe.  It occurs to me that maybe I should lock the door, so I walk over and start to do so but then the door starts to open towards me.  Out of instinct I slammed it back shut and frantically locked the door.  I would have written it off as a drunk college kid who was confused and thought it was their apartment*, but when I looked through the peephole to make sure it wasn’t an ex boyfriend or something (lol), the person was blocking it so I couldn’t see anything, and they just stood there for a minute or so, silently jiggling the handle and blocking the peephole (while I had a complete heart attack).  Eventually I guess they left via the stairwell right next to my door, because the jiggling stopped, and when I worked up the nerve to look through the peephole again there was no one there.  For all I know, they were standing out of sight waiting for me to open the door to look out, but fortunately I was too much of a baby for that.

*I still think it was probably some variation on this, but it was insanely creepy in the moment."

I also have never been in a place that had any kind of poster or pamphlet about this.  I was in high school in the internet years so I assume I would have figured it out, but if it had been 20 years earlier I would’ve been clueless.  I do think I probably would have ended up trying to leave it somewhere where it would be found (hospital, church, etc.) but it’s also easy to think that now as a well-educated adult with access to the internet, money of my own, transportation, the ability to leave my house without permission, etc.  I’m not excusing the horrible things that happen to these babies and I obviously don’t think anyone who hurts a baby is in their right mind, but I do think it’s a little unfair to assume that all the mothers in stories like this were like “well, I could take this easy step to ensure my baby gets to live a happy and healthy life or I could just dump them/kill them because it’s marginally more convenient for me.”

On a more serious note, this seems like an unusual sub to be the subject of this kind of campaign.  My only conspiracy theory is that there are a fair number of negative comments about the Facebook group, so I suppose it’s possible that someone there likes reading here for the info but also hates this sub on principle?  I guess the other theory would be that, as discussed, Peloton itself doesn’t seem to like this sub and seems to want to direct social media users to the Facebook group.  I suppose it’s possible that someone in their marketing department is trying to decrease conversation here, but that seems (1) weird and over the top and (2) not sufficiently clearly to their benefit that I can imagine them ever actually doing it - although the criticism here can be tough, overall there are a ton of people here who love their bikes/treads and convince tons of OTHER people to buy them.  I don’t even post that often and I think I’ve gotten five referral credits from random strangers that I started talking to about whether they should get a bike.

selfimprovement,fdfbh07,t3_el31lb,1578357766.0,"So I agree with the therapy recommendation.    More generally, I suspect fewer people give this any thought than you think.  You should ignore any of the below if you’re open to therapy, but if not, it seems like there are a few approaches you could take: 

-first, you can try to just make some friends with people you have stuff in common with and not bring this up.  If someone eventually brings it up, you have to be ready to either just own it seriously (e.g. “yeah, I really liked her and I just thought it was an easier way to express my feelings without bothering her directly since I figured she didn’t like me back.  Lesson learned, though”) OR to make a joke of it (e.g. “yeah, turns out the ladies don’t love when you write insufficiently anonymized fanfic about them, who knew?”) The serious approach is probably the mentally healthier one but I have a tendency to fall back on jokes when I’m uncomfortable, so.  Either way, you just have to be super chill about it - people respect people who seem to be okay with themselves, even if they’re doing something “weird.”

-second, you can just own it from the outset (“hey, mind if I join your lab group?  Full disclosure, if you’ve heard about that guy who did the weird fanfic thing on the school page and wouldn’t want that guy in your lab group, you probably should say no, but if you’re on the fence, I can woo you with my chemistry skills and free notoriety.”)

-third, you can just keep your head down until you leave, after which it becomes significantly easier to just pretend this kind of thing never happened.  I had an embarrassing internet thing in grad school and although people out there in the world still know about it, it’s a lot different than seeing those people every day, and no one I know now thinks of me with that in mind.  Even if someone eventually told them, they would have already formed their own opinion of me.

Above all, though, you really should talk to a therapist.  Not only will they have much better advice (hopefully backed by some sort of social science and not just reddit armchair therapy), they’ll have a better sense of the best way to handle this in light of who you are as a person (while being autistic is probably relevant here, I also just mean your personality - for example, I can’t pull off being serious about stuff that embarrasses me because I come off as WAYYY too serious and aggressive.  I have much better results with being humorous than with being sincere.  You might be the exact opposite, and someone who interacts with you in person will have a much better grasp on this).

Anyway, I’m sorry this happened to you - I love the internet, but I sometimes wish I had been born 70 or so years ago and could just live without worrying about stuff like this.  Your intentions were good, and, worst case scenario, you’ve got your whole life ahead of you to go interesting places and meet cool people who either have no idea this happened or couldn’t care less what happened when you were in college because everyone does dumb stuff they regret in those years."

It’s possible it was consensual, but if she was actually a very observant Jew, that seems less likely (not that religious people can’t have affairs, but I would expect her to have been fairly sheltered, and 8 months into marriage seems very early to have an affair).  Was her husband Jewish?  If not, I would lean even further in the direction of rape, because it removes the “she wanted to marry the felon but couldn’t because he wasn’t Jewish” angle."
